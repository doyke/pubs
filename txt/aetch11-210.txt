The “ROAD TO WINGS” series is a 33-year account of AETC T-37 and T-38 aircraft mishaps. This par-
ticular handbook covers T-38 aircraft and includes T-38 Class A flight mis hap summaries from 1972
through November 2005. The information in this handbook is not intended to establish procedures or be
directive in nature. Its sole purpose is to provide pilot training activities with a source of lessons learned
from history. The majority of mishaps contained herein involve undergraduate pilot training (UPT) mis-
sions, and it is from this distin ction the handbook deriv es its title. Because all info rmation in this hand-
book is historical, it may contain some now-obsolete references.
This publication does not apply to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command units. Ensure all
records created as a res ult of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accor dance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.
See Attachment 1 for glossary of references and support information and Attachment 2 for a T-38 Class
A Mishap Summary (1972 through November 2005).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This handbook is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Six new T-38 Class A mis-
haps have been added since the last edition.

                                                PROLOGUE
We should all bear one thing in mind when we talk about a troop that rode one in. He called upon the sum
of all his knowledge and made a judgment. He believed in it so strongly that he knowingly bet his life on
it. The fact he was mistaken in his judgment is a tragedy, not stupidity. Every supervisor and contempo-
rary who ever spoke to him had an opportunity to influence his judgment. So a little bit of all of us goes in
with every troop we lose.

Section A—Takeoff and Departure

1. Stall:
   1.1. Mishap (Figure 1.). The mishap was a dual miss ion, and the aircraft cras hed shortly after take-
   off. Acceleration and rotation appeared normal wi th liftoff about 3,000 feet down the runway . Once
   airborne, the aircraft quickly rotated to an abnormally high pitch attitude. As the aircraft climbed to its
   maximum height of around 150 feet above ground level (AGL), the left wing dropped noticeably and
   the aircraft began to descend. As the nose appeared to drop toward the horizon, the aircraft suddenly
   rolled right to approximately 90 degrees of bank. At some point during th is sequence, the pilot
   retracted the gear and flaps. The pilot maneuvered back toward a wings level position, but the rate of
   descent continued to increase. The pitch attitude remained slightly nose high. The crew was unable to
   recover the aircraft, and it impacted the ground 6,800 feet from brake release. Parameters at impact
   were 17 degree s of right bank, 5 degre es nose hi gh, and approxima tely 198 knot indicated airspeed
   (KIAS). Neither crewmember ejected, and both were fatally injured.

Figure 1. Stall.




   1.2. Investigation:
       1.2.1. Operator Factor. The pilot apparently stalled the aircraft just after liftoff with insufficient
       altitude to recover.
       1.2.2. Supervisory Factor. It is not certain who was flying the aircraft; but either way, it appears
       the instructor pilot (IP) allowed the aircraft to enter a stall shortly after liftoff.
   1.3. Lesson Learned. IPs and student pilo ts (SP) must have a thor ough understanding of aircraft
   aerodynamics, stall characteristics, and stall recovery procedures of the T-38. The ability to recognize
   and avoid this flight regime is especially critical during the takeoff and landing phases of flight. Addi-
   tionally, IPs must not hesitate to assume aircraft control to prevent a mishap.
   1.4. Action Taken. None.
10                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


2. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls:
     2.1. Mishap (Figure 2.). The mission was a local four-ship formation training flight. Shortly after
     takeoff, the SP flying as Number 2 so lo heard a loud noise and felt a lo ss of thrust as he retarded the
     throttles out of afterburner. The right engine revolutions per mi nute (rpm) dropped to approximately
     15 percent. The SP attempted an unsuccessful airstart while lead repositioned himself to scan his air-
     craft. Lead reported seeing fire through a hole in the bottom of the aircraft. The aircraft then began
     uncommanded and uncontrollable pitc h oscillations. The IP in the l ead aircraft directed the SP to
     eject. (Although the SP ejected with out injury, he inadvertently opened his lap belt either before or
     during the ejection sequence and was forced to manually deploy his parachute. ) The ai rcraft was
     destroyed upon impact.

Figure 2. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls.




     2.2. Investigation (Material Factor). The right engine turbine wheel failed due to a fatigue crack.
     The failure resulted in damage to pitch control linkages and loss of aircraft control.
     2.3. Lesson Learned. Emergencies can happen at any time, and the situation can degrade rapidly so
     be prepared. In this case, the SP and IP handled the situation well, using effective cockpit/crew
     resource management (CRM) and potentially saving the SP’s life.
     2.4. Action Taken:
        2.4.1. Reduced turbine wheel replacement time and accelerated efforts to procure a turbine wheel
        with a better design.
        2.4.2. Changed inspection methods and requirements in an effort to improve detection of fatigue
        cracks.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              11


      2.4.3. Installed improved pneumatic fire sensor system (including an automatic integrity monitor)
      in T-38 aircraft.

3. Bird Strike—Dual Engine Failure:
   3.1. Mishap (Figure 3.). The mission was a two-ship formation f light with SPs in the front se ats.
   Preflight, taxi, and formation ta keoff were normal. As the form ation accelerated to 270 KIAS a nd
   climbed to 3,100 feet mean sea level (MSL) (600 feet AGL), several birds struck the lead aircraft front
   canopy. The front canopy Plexiglas was completely destroyed, and the engines ingested the debris.
   Neither crewmember was injured by the bird strike, but the damage caused a loss of thrust. The air-
   craft decelerated immediately and entered a shallow descent. The IP’s forward visibility was probably
   obscured due to bird remains on the windscreen. As the rpm fluc tuated, the SP obse rved what he
   believed to be throttle movements made by the IP . However, the engines did not respond so the IP
   ordered ejection. After a slight hesitation, the SP ejected successfully around 300 feet AGL. The IP’s
   seat fired as the aircraft imp acted the ground. The aircraft was destroyed, and the IP was fatally
   injured.

Figure 3. Bird Strike—Dual Engine Failure.




     3.2. Investigation (Environmental Factor). A bird strike shortly after takeof f destroyed the front
     cockpit canopy. Both engines ingested bird remains and/or Plexiglas fr agments, resulting in a loss of
     thrust and the inability to sustain level flight.
     3.3. Lesson Learned. Aircrews should weigh the be nefits of using dual viso rs if conditions permit.
     Additionally, aircrews must make timely ejecti on decisions, use proper terminology during cr itical
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              13


   and emergency phases of flight, a nd thoroughly brief ejection consider ations with and without inter-
   com.
   3.4. Action Taken. Accelerated research and development of bird resistant canopies.

4. Bird Strike—Dual Engine Failure:
   4.1. Mishap (Figure 4.). The aircraft was lead in a two-ship formation training flight with an IP in
   the front cockpit (FCP) and an unqualified instructor pilot (UIP) in the rear cockpit (RCP) The lead
   aircraft impacted a flock of 30 to 50 birds as the gear and flaps we re retracted. Both engines stalled
   and flamed out. The IP ordered bailout after dete rmining the aircraft was not recoverable. The UIP
   ejected immediately, and the IP followed 3 seconds later. Both ejections were successful, but the IP
   suffered a compression fracture due to improper body position at ejection. The aircraft was destroyed
   upon impact.
14                                                                   AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 4. Bird Strike—Dual Engine Failure.




     4.2. Investigation (Environmental Factor). Bird ingestion caused both engines to stall and flame-
     out.
     4.3. Lesson Learned. Tower and runway supervisory unit (R SU) personnel rely heavily on aircrew
     reports of bird activity. Although bird warnings may be commonplace, aircrews must strive to combat
     complacency. Pilots must be vigilant, especially during the critical takeoff and landing phases where
     bird strikes pose the greatest threat.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                   15


   4.4. Action Taken. Increased emphasis on improving the co mmand’s Bird Aircra ft Strike Hazard
   (BASH) Program.

5. Engine Failure—Touch and Go:
   5.1. Mishap (Figure 5.). The flight was an RCP contact mission for the IP who had recently returned
   from IP training with a flight examiner (FE) in the FCP. After some area work, the aircraft returned to
   the pattern to practice some landings. The fourth pattern was a full-fla touch and go with the IP flying
                                                                             p
   the aircraft. Everything was normal until just after liftoff. As the gear and flaps were retracting, the left
   engine rpm rolled back to 60 to 70 percent. The FE assumed control of the aircraft and selected after-
   burner on the right engine. He then selected afterburner on the left engine, too, but was unable to sus-
   tain level flight and ordered ejection. The FE ejected successfully, but the IP was fatally injured due to
   late chute deployment.
16                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 5. Engine Failure—Touch and Go.




     5.2. Investigation:
        5.2.1. Material Factor. Shortly after takeoff the left engine rpm rolled back to 60 to 70 percent
        due to an undetermined malfuncti on. The IP did not ini tially recognize the rollback and initiated
        gear and flap retraction.
        5.2.2. Operator and Supervisory Factor. The FE recog nized engine rollback while assuming
        aircraft control, but did not notice the gear and flap retraction. He failed to take immediate action
        to establish the correct aircraft attitude and/or flap position.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 17


      5.2.3. Other Factor. The IP’s parachute lanyard assembly was severed just below the parachute
      arming lanyard knob by imp act with the FCP ejection seat pr ior to seat/man separation. This
      caused the automatic parachute deployment sequence to fail. The IP attempted to manually deploy
      his chute by pulling the D-ring, but did not get a full chute prior to ground impact.
   5.3. Lessons Learned:
      5.3.1. The current flap selector switch had not yet been incorporated in the T-38. Flaps were con-
      trolled by using a method similar to the present day auxiliary fl ap switch. This method required
      careful attention to setting the flaps at the desired position, and the poor design contributed to the
      mishap.
      5.3.2. Pilots must develop good habit patterns such as checking the configuration more than once
      before takeoff or landing, to ensure cockpit checks are complete. Checking the aircraft configura-
      tion at multiple points may make the dif ference in an em ergency situation. For example, it is
      important to check the configuration at the perch, in the final tur n, and rolling out on final. Pilots
      might miss something at the perch, but this technique gives them two more opportunities to catch
      a problem before touching down.
   5.4. Action Taken:
      5.4.1. Accelerated the T-38 aircraft modification to incorporate the three-position flap switch on a
      priority basis.
      5.4.2. Changed Technical Order (TO) IT-38A and AT-38B Aircraft, Flight Manual USAF Series,
      Emergency Procedure, Engine Failure During Takeoff, to read as follows:


    a. If decision is made to stop: Abort.
    b If takeoff is continued:
         (1) Throttles—MAX.
         (2) Flaps—60 percent.
         (3) Attain airspeed above single-engine takeoff speed (10 knots desired).
         (4) Gear up (as required above single-engine takeoff speed plus 10 knots).
         (5) Flaps up (as required above 190 KIAS).

      5.4.3. Continued research on sequenced ejection system for T-38 aircraft.

6. Stall—Touch and Go:
   6.1. Mishap (Figure 6.). The flight was a pre-solo contact mis sion. The SP fl ew a simulated sin-
   gle-engine touch and go prior to departing the traffic pattern. The final approach was steeper than nor-
   mal with a firm touchdown. Immediately after touchdown, the SP pulled the aircraft back into the air
   in a nose high attitude and idle power. The aircraft encountered wing rock, and the left wing contacted
   the runway. The aircraft momentarily leveled of f in a near-normal takeoff attitude, but then began to
   climb with an increasingly nose hi gh attitude. The aircraft rolled le ft to approximately 60 degrees of
   bank and then recovered to a near wings level attit ude. The aircraft then stalled and impacted the
   ground in 115 degrees of left bank and 15 degr ees nose low. The aircraft was destroyed, and both
   crewmembers were fatally injured.
18                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 6. Stall—Touch and Go.




     6.2. Investigation:
        6.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to assume control of the air craft in time to pre vent a
        stall.
        6.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP applied excessive back stick pressure which caused the aircraft
        to become airborne in a nose high attitude at idle power.
     6.3. Lesson Learned. Stalls during the landing phase leave little to no margin for error. It is critically
     important to execute proper stall recovery procedures immediately, which may require relaxing the
     back stick pressure to break the stall condition. Additionally, the loss of aircraft control at a low alti-
     tude may not allow time for corrective actions and may require an immediate ejection.
     6.4. Action Taken. Expanded the governing directive to incl ude a discussion of takeof f and landing
     irregularities such as wing rock, balloon, bounce, premature liftoff, and overrotation.

7. Flight Control Malfunction:
     7.1. Mishap (Figure 7.). The flight was scheduled as a dual contact training mission. The IP per-
     formed the takeoff in accordance with (IAW) the mission brief. The left wing dropped immediately
     after liftoff as if the aircraft had encountered mild wake turbulence or a strong crosswind. The IP
     applied right aileron and a slight amount of right rudder to correct the bank. As the wings leveled, the
     IP relaxed the aileron and rudder pressure and the aircraft immediately rolled sharply left to approxi-
     mately 45 degrees of bank. The IP immediately applied right aileron and right rudder, but the aircraft
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 19


   did not respond as anticipated. He continued aileron and rudder application until he had full right aile-
   ron and full right rudder. The aircraft was low to the ground and had veered left away from the runway
   surface. It was in an extreme skid due to the full right rudder application, but started to roll out of the
   bank. The IP relaxed some of the control pressure as the aircraft approached wings level; but when he
   did, the aircr aft rolled sharply lef t again to approximately 90 degrees of ban k. He applie d full right
   aileron and full right rudde r one more time, managed to bring the aircraft back to a near wings-level
   attitude, and commanded ejection. The aircraft was now around 300 feet AGL and 220 knots. The SP
   ejected immediately and was uninjured. As the IP relaxed the control stick to initiate his ejection, the
   aircraft rolled left to approximately 70 to 90 degrees of bank. Despite the low altitude and aircraft atti-
   tude, the IP also ejected successfully. The aircraft continued its descent and impacted the ground in 80
   to 90 degrees of left bank and 45 degrees nose low. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 7. Flight Control Malfunction.




   7.2. Investigation:
      7.2.1. Maintenance Factor. An unknown person failed to install the cotter pin that secures the
      nut on the connecting bolt and valve push rod for the right aileron. The nut backed off, and the
      right aileron moved to a near full down position, resulting in a loss of aircraft control.
      7.2.2. Supervisory Factor. Supervision failed to conduct proper post-maintenance inspections.
   7.3. Lesson Learned. Flight control malfunctions at low al titude are extraordinarily challenging,
   requiring timely analysis and decision-making whil e threatening to saturate your task management
   ability. You have little time to determine the aircraft’s controllability before exceeding the ejection
   envelope. Consider your ejection criteria before you release the brakes.
20                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     7.4. Action Taken:
        7.4.1. Conducted a one-time inspection on T-38 and F-5 aileron operating mechanisms.
        7.4.2. Revised maintenance T Os and work cards to clarify installation of key washers, lock wir-
        ing, and cotter pins.
        7.4.3. Required all critical flight control areas to be inspected by independent, qualified inspec-
        tors.

8. Abort—Runway Departure:
     8.1. Mishap (Figure 8.). The mishap aircrew was on an accelerated copilot enrichment (ACE) navi-
     gation and cross-country mission. The pilot performed a high speed abort during takeoff at a stopover
     airfield when the aircraft failed to rotate. The aircraft left the prepared surface and came to a stop 400
     feet past the end of the overru n, sustaining major damage. Both crewmembers egressed without
     injury.

Figure 8. Abort—Runway Departure.




     8.2. Investigation (Operator Factor):
        8.2.1. Because crewmembers were accustomed to flying at a locat ion where takeoff and landing
        data were rarely a factor, they became complacent with their takeoff and landing data (TOLD) cal-
        culations. Bottom line: The pilot misjudged the takeoff performance based on poor habit patterns
        and failed to account for a higher temperature and altitude than he was used to.
        8.2.2. The aircraft did not rotate because the pilo failed to attain proper stick position for rotation.
                                                             t
        He misjudged aircraft response as a malfunction and aborted the airc raft before it had suf ficient
        time to rotate. Additionally, the pilot initiated his abort 6 knots above refusal speed. (The airspeed
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              21


      markers in both cockpits were set at 155 knots as opposed to the actual refusal or adjusted refusal
      speed of 149/136 KIAS.)
      8.2.3. Also, due to improper braking technique, the pilot locked the right brake and blew the tire,
      causing extensive damage to th e wheel assembly. The s ubsequent directional control problems
      caused a high speed departure from the prepared surface.
   8.3. Lesson Learned. Complacency can kill you, and this aircrew destroyed a perfectly good aircraft
   because of it. Take the extra time to do a ccurate TOLD calculations an d make sure you understand
   what each of the numbers means. Addition ally, think about your personal habi t patterns and iden tify
   areas where you might become complacent due to “standard ops” at the home field.
   8.4. Action Taken. None.

9. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls:
   9.1. Mishap (Figure 9.). The mishap aircraft was on a dual contact training miss ion. The crew had
   just completed a straight-in, to uch-and-go landing. As the aircraft became airborne, they heard a
   “bang” and began to smell smoke. The right engine fire light il luminated, and the crew noted the
   engine rpm at 20 percent. As the crew shut down the right engine, they noticed the left engine fire
   light was also illuminated. The IP started a clim b, but lost all pitch control passing 1,500 feet AGL.
   The crewmembers ejected passing 2,000 feet AGL and were uninjured. The aircraft was destroyed
   upon impact.

Figure 9. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls.
22                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     9.2. Investigation (Logistics Factor):
        9.2.1. The fifth-stage disk-life cycle did not provide an adequate sa fety margin. Unit supervisors
        throughout the command faile d to ensure that materi al deficiency reports were submitted on all
        cracked or failed fifth stage disks. As a result , the engine manager was unaware of any problem.
        Otherwise, he might have reduced the life cycle.
        9.2.2. The misha p engine’s fifth-stage disk had deve loped a low-cycle fatigue crack, leading to
        catastrophic failure on the mishap sortie. The disk fragments pene trated the engine case and rup-
        tured the fuel lines. Escaping fuel ignited on the hot section of the engine, causing the right engine
        fire light to illuminate. Although the crew shut down the right engi ne, the fire continued to burn
        and damaged the pitch control mechanism.
     9.3. Lesson Learned. Properly reporting material deficiencies can prevent accidents. It would likely
     have prevented this fifth-stage disk from remaining in the aircraft until failure.
     9.4. Action Taken:
        9.4.1. Emphasized material deficiency reporting procedures.
        9.4.2. Conducted de tailed study of fifth-stage compress or-disk cracks and failures to determine
        true extent of failure potential.

10. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls:
     10.1. Mishap (Figure 10.). The mission was flown by two IPs on a cross-count ry flight. The RCP
     pilot completed a normal rolling takeof f. After liftoff, both pilots heard a loud bang as the RCP pilot
     retarded the throttles out of afterburner. The RCP pilot noted the left engine rpm decaying through 40
     percent and retarded the throttle to idle. The FCP pilot assumed command of the aircraft and declared
     an emergency. The right fire light illuminated 3 to 4 seconds later, and the aircraft began a slight roll
     to the left with an uncommande d pitchup. The FCP pilo t commanded ejection as he lost aircraft
     response, and both crewmembers ejected successfully.

     10.2. Investigation (Material Factor). The stage two turbine wheel on the left engine developed a
     crack as a result of a machining defect. During initial takeoff, the stage two turbine wheel failed, caus-
     ing an uncontained engine failure. T urbine parts penetrated the engine firewall, allowing hydraulic

   lines to be exposed to hot combustion gases. The hydraulic lines burned through depleting pressure in
   both hydraulic systems. The aircraft became uncontrollable as the hydraulic pressure depleted.
   10.3. Lesson Learned. This is just another reminder of just how quickly a situat ion can deteriorate.
   The transfer of aircraft control happened at a critical stage. However, it was done correctly and did not
   impact the outcome. The crew made a timely decision to eject, and both were uninjured.
   10.4. Action Taken:
      10.4.1. Conducted an urgent engineering analysis on stage-two turbine wheels to identify neces-
      sary corrective actions and prevent future occurrences.
      10.4.2. Performed a research study to determine the feasibility of implementing a nondestructive
      inspection technique to detect turbine-wheel cracks.

11. Bird Strike—Dual Engine Failure:
   11.1. Mishap (Figure 11.). The mission was a dual-contact student training sortie. After completing
   area work, the mishap aircraft entered the pattern for a straight-in approach followed by overhead pat-
   terns. The aircraft encountered a flock of birds on departure leg from the fifth overhead pattern at 300
   feet AGL and 240 KIAS. Both engine ingested birds, and compressor stalled. The IP assumed control
                                           s
   of the aircraft and noticed the left rpm decreasing. He retarded the left throttle to idle and pressed the
   engine start button. As he began a turn to crosswind, he noticed the right rpm was also decreasing. He
   retarded the right throttle slightly and pressed bot h engine start buttons. Both engines continued to
   fluctuate and would not stabilize at any throttle position. The aircraft developed a sink rate as the air-
   speed decreased. The IP made sure the aircraft was clear of populated areas and commanded ejection.
   Both pilots ejected successfully and were uninjured. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

     11.2. Investigation (Environmental Factor). The mishap aircraft flew through a flock of birds on
     its departure leg, and both engines ingested birds.
     11.3. Lesson Learned. This was the first time the T-38 single motion ejection system was used suc-
     cessfully. Both ejection seats were properly inst alled and functioned correctly. The crew made a
     timely decision to eject. The R CP pilot ejected at approximately 561 feet AGL, followed 1 second
     later by the FCP pilot at approx imately 500 feet AGL. Despite th e low altitude, both crewmembers
     were uninjured.
     11.4. Action Taken. None.

12. Engine Fire and Catastrophic Failure:
     12.1. Mishap (Figure 12.). The mission was a single-ship navigation sortie flown by an IP and a first
     pilot (FP). The crew heard a loud pop or bang on the departure leg of the initial takeoff. (The throttles
     were still in afterburner.) The crew analyzed the indications as a compressor stall, and the FP retarded
     the left throttle to idle. The fire light illuminated a short t ime later. The FP confirmed the fire light
     with the IP and shut down the e ngine, using appropriate boldface procedures. However, the fire light
     remained on. The left hydraulic pr essure was zero as the left engi ne windmilled at 20 to 22 percent
     rpm. The FP initiated a turn to downwind, set up fo r a straight-in approach, and declared an emer-
     gency. The IP as sumed control of the aircraft for t he pattern and landing IAW the brief. The cre w
     noted no other indications of a fire, and tower personnel did not see any smoke or flames trailing the
     mishap aircraft. The IP began having problems controlling the pitch, but had good aileron control. He
     transferred control of the aircraft back to the FP to see if he coul d control the pitch, but he could not.
     The right hydraulic pressure began to decrease, and the ailerons ceased to respond. The crew ejected
     successfully, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 12. Engine Fire and Catastrophic Failure.




     12.2. Investigation:
        12.2.1. Miscellaneous Factor. At an unknown time, the second- stage compressor disk was
        exposed to corrosive elements, causing pitting in the bore section.
        12.2.2. Logistics and Material Factor. Previous specifications fo r the af t sect ion f lexible
        hydraulic hoses included inferior material which melted at a temperature of 400 degrees F to 500
        degrees F.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                  25


      12.2.3. Material Factor. The second-stage compressor disk failed catastrophically on the depar-
      ture leg, penetrating the engine case, dislodging a fuel line, severing a hydraulic line, and igniting
      fuel and hydraulic fluid in the engine bay.
   12.3. Lesson Learned. The inspection cycle for J-85 engine compressor disks was too long, hamper-
   ing corrosion or crack detection prior to failure.
   12.4. Action Taken:
      12.4.1. Modified the J-85 engine by installing a redesigned and sturdier second-stage disk.
      12.4.2. Compressed time change requirements for the second stage disk. This was more effective
      at alleviating the problem than decreasing time between inspections.

13. Engine Failure and Loss of Flight Controls:
   13.1. Mishap (Figure 13.). The mission was dual cont act and was the SP’ s ninth sortie in the T -38.
   The IP was well experienced. The SP r etarded the throttles out of after burner just after takeof f at
   approximately 100 feet AGL and 240 KIAS. The crew heard a loud bang as the SP retarded the left
   throttle. An aircraft offset from the runway noticed a fireball from the left side of the mishap aircraft.
   The left rpm dropped to zero, and the left hydraulic and generator caution lights illuminated. The left
   fire light illuminated about 1 second later. The IP took control of the aircraft, brought the left throttle
   to idle, and selected afterburner on the right engine. A chase aircraft informed the crew that there was
   no smoke or fire coming from the mishap aircraft. The aircraft then began an uncommanded pitchup,
   and the right fire light illuminated for a few seco nds. The IP pushed the nose over , but the aircraft
   would not level out. The IP commanded an ejection, and the crew ejected su ccessfully with minor
   injuries. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

     13.2. Investigation:
        13.2.1. Logistics Factor. The eighth-stage compressor disks in the J-85 engine were susceptible
        to corrosion, which led to fatigue failures. Although the corrosion was a known problem, the fre-
        quency of disk failures was so lo w it was dif ficult to accurately predict the severity. A historical
        survey after this incident indicated eighth-stage disk failures typically resulted in uncontained
        engine failures, in-flight fires, hydraulic and fuel line burn-thr ough, and eventual loss of aircraft
        control. Prior to this, leadership had considered the corrosion and possible disk failure an accept-
        able risk due to the low probability.
        13.2.2. Logistics Factor. Logistics managers failed to implement a mandatory recurring inspec-
        tion of the J-85 eighth-stage compre ssor disks. Also, Logistic mana gers did not direct inspectors
        to use newly developed inspection methods.
     13.3. Lesson Learned. Although catastrophic failures during a critical phase of flight are infrequent,
     they do happen. In this situation, there was nothing the crew could do to stop the chain of events that
     started with the disk failure. This mishap also highlighted the dif ficulty in making risk assessments
     involving low probability, but high severity. When doing your own personal risk assessments, be sure
     to critically evaluate the consequences, even if the probability is very low. If your decision could even
     remotely lead to loss of aircraft (or possible loss of life), take time to reconsider.
     13.4. Action Taken:
        13.4.1. Reduced the eighth-stage disk’s life limit.
        13.4.2. Implemented nondestructive inspections to identify corrosion and fatigue.
        13.4.3. Began process to redesign and replace old disks with new, non corrosive disks.

14. Loss of Control—Poor Transfer of Aircraft Control:
     14.1. Mishap (Figure 14.). The mishap sortie was a pre-solo c ontact sortie. The SP performed the
     takeoff and lifted off at approximately 155 knots. The SP was using stick only to control the aircraft
     and had his feet flat on the floor. The aircraft rolled right immediately after takeoff, and the SP over-
     corrected with left aileron causing the aircraft to roll into approximately 60 degrees of left bank. The
     SP told the IP something was wrong.The IP stepped on the rudder to counter the roll, but did not com-
     municate transfer of c ontrol to the SP. The SP continued to fight the roll with ailerons. He did not
     know the IP was making r udder inputs because his feet were still on the floor. The combined and
     uncoordinated efforts of both aircrew members resulted in a rolling pilot induced oscillation (PIO). As
     the aircraft rolled back and fort h reaching 90 degrees of bank in both directi ons, the IP commanded
     bailout. The crew ejected successfully just prio r to the aircraft striking the ground. The aircraft
     departed the runway, skidded through the grass, and came to rest in the center of the adjacent parallel
     runway.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 27


Figure 14. Loss of Control—Poor Transfer of Aircraft Control.




   14.2. Investigation:
      14.2.1. Maintenance Factor. The aircraft had prev iously been written up for an uncommanded
      rolling motion. Maintenance determined the stabi lity augmenter caused th e roll, but they did not
      consult with Operations before releasing the aircraft for flight. If they had, Operations would have
      known that the type of rolling motion described in the original AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/
      Mission Flight Data Document, writeup would not have come fr om a stability augmenter mal-
      function and would have ordered a functiona l check flight (FCF) prior to release. The roll was
      more likely caused by elongated holes in one of the wingtips wher e the wingtip at tached to the
      main wing, allowing the wingtip to shift out of position.
      14.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP ove rcontrolled the aircraft due to ine xperience. The SP’s
      attempts to control the aircraft were probably aggravated by the uncommanded rolling tendencies
      of the aircraft.
      14.2.3. Supervisory Factor. The IP did not take control of the aircraft with a “positive exchange
      of aircraft control.” This resulted in the IP and SP unknowingly fighting each other for control of
      the aircraft. Although the aircraft was controllable, the crew thought they were out of control and
      ejected.
      14.2.4. Operator Factor. The IP was complacent and not mentally prepared to take control of the
      aircraft. This led to a “reactive” response as opposed to a deliberate and properly executed transfer
      of aircraft control.
   14.3. Lesson Learned. Although both th e IP and SP survive d, this was another reminder compla-
   cency can kill. You need to be on your game flying high performance aircraft, particularly during crit-
   ical phases of flight. The IP was complacent and not mentally prepared to take control of the aircraft.
   Improper execution of a basic task like transfer of aircraft control cost an airplane and nearly the crew.
   A pilot tends to fall prey to complacency around 400 to 800 hours. (This IP had approximately 450
   hours in the T-38.) In addition, the SP’s habit of flying with his feet on the floor prevented him from
   identifying the IP’s rudder inputs as one source of the aircraft’s rolling motion.
   14.4. Action Taken:
      14.4.1. Re quested a cha nge to AFI 21-101/AETC Sup 1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
      Management, to require operations coordination for release of aircraft following impoundment for
      flight control malfunctions.
28                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        14.4.2. Recommended publishing a T O to help an alyze and troubleshoot a bnormal aircraft han-
        dling characteristics (AHC).
        14.4.3. Requested evaluation of the failure det ection and fault accommodation capability of the
        stability augmenter system.
        14.4.4. Recommended changing AFI 11-290/AETC Sup 1, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
        Training Program, to require IP complacency and proper transfer of aircraft control during critical
        phases of flight as an annual briefing topic.
        14.4.5. Recommended incorporating this mishap in the T-38 Road to Wings.

Section B—Flight Control and Structural Failure Mishaps

15. Flight Control Malfunction—Formation Rejoin:
     15.1. Mishap (Figure 15.). The mission was flown a s a two-ship fo rmation training sortie with the
     mishap aircraft as Number 2. Takeoff, departure, and initial area work (to include extended trail) were
     uneventful. About 30 minutes into the profile, th e lead aircraft initiated a right-turning rejoin at
     approximately 10,000 feet AGL. The IP in the lead aircraft observed Number 2 approach to approxi-
     mately 500 feet, enter a rapid tight barrel roll to the left, and disappear from sight. During the maneu-
     ver, Number 2 made a garbled radio transmission and the only discernable word was “break.” Lead
     was not able to reestablish visual or radio contact with his wingman. The mishap aircraft impacted the
     ground extremely nose low at high velocity . Neither crewmember ejected, and both were fatally
     injured.

Figure 15. Flight Control Malfunction—Formation Rejoin.




   15.2. Investigation:
      15.2.1. Maintenance Factor. At an unknown time, maintenance pe rsonnel failed to install the
      cotter pin on the rod end “V” and valve push rod connecting bolt (left aileron).
      15.2.2. Maintenance Supervision Factor. Maintenance supervisors failed to detect the problem
      during subsequent inspections. During flight, the unsecured nut backed off, allowing the rod end
      “V” to become disconnected from the valve push rod. The left aileron moved to an uncommanded
      position, resulting in an uncontrollable left roll.
   15.3. Lesson Learned. Complacency and failure to follow TO guidance resulted in the loss of an air-
   craft and crew. Maintainers and supervisors must remain focused a nd alert for maintenance errors or
   technical data deficiencies.
30                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     15.4. Action Taken:
        15.4.1. Accomplished a one-time inspection of all T-38 and F-5 aircraft aileron-actuating mecha-
        nisms.
        15.4.2. Where feasible, installed self-locking castellated nuts in critic al flight control areas of
        T-38 and F-5 aircraft.
        15.4.3. Revised task orientation training (TOT) for personnel conducting periodic maintenance to
        include a familiarization course in primary flight control inspections.
        15.4.4. Improved physical inspection (PE) work ca rds by adding a picture of the aileron mecha-
        nism and the following warning:


                                                   WARNING
         Failure to install cotter pins and safety wire can cause loss of aircraft and possible fatal
         injury to aircrews.

16. Structural Failure—Area:
     16.1. Mishap (Figure 16.). The mission was flown as a single-ship instrument training sortie. Take-
     off and departure to the low alti tude working area were uneventful. After approximately 22 minutes,
     the air traffic control center lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft. The center contacted the
     squadron, and the squadron initiate d a radio and te lephone search. Local residents and law enforce-
     ment personnel eventually located the aircraft wreck age. An Air Force helic opter was dispatched to
     the site to begin the investiga tion. Neither crewmember attempted to ej ect, and both were fatally
     injured.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               31


Figure 16. Structural Failure—Area.




   16.2. Investigation:
      16.2.1. Logistics Factor. The aircraft had been modified for a flight test 11 years before the mis-
      hap. Two holes and a notch were machined in the lo wer right wing to attach the flight test instru-
      ments. The aircraft was accepted and placed back in service without a study to determine the effect
      the holes and notch would have on the structural integrity of th e right wing. A crack emanating
      from the notch was detected in the lower right wing skin 7 years before the mishap. The air logis-
      tics center designed a permanent wing repair, which was accomplished at the home base.
      16.2.2. Maintenance Factor. A tool mark was introd uced in the lower righ t wing skin near the
      area of repair when th e wing was disassembled during overhaul. The wing was installed on the
      mishap aircraft 2 years later (5 years before the mishap). At some point, a fatigue crack developed
      at the tool mark. At an indeterminable G load during the mishap flight, the fatigue crack extended
      catastrophically chord-wise causi ng structural failure of the right wing. The resultant high G
      forces immediately incapacitated both crewme mbers. The aircraft was destroyed upon ground
      impact, and both crewmembers were fatally injured.
   16.3. Lesson Learned. The mishap aircraft had been modified for specia l testing, which included
   modifications to the wing skin—a primary , load-bearing structure. Failure to determine the lif e
   expectancy of the wing before returning it to the active inventory indicated a serious deficiency in the
   logistics system. Inspection and acceptance procedures must be sufficient to reasonably assure a mod-
   ified aircraft will remain airworthy during its normal life expectancy.
   16.4. Action Taken. Established a requirement for a thorough analysis of any aircraft having a mod-
   ified primary structure before the aircraft is placed in the active Air Force inventory.
32                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


17. Flight Control Malfunction—Area:
     17.1. Mishap (Figure 17.). The mishap aircraft was on a dual student training mission. After 20 min-
     utes of flight, the aircraft experienced an uncom manded right roll during a high speed dive recovery
     by the SP. The IP took the aircraft and managed to regain partial control by applying full left stick and
     full left rudder. During the subseq uent controllability ch eck, the aircraft en tered a right roll and
     became uncontrollable when the landing gear was lowered. Both crewmembers ejected at around
     11,000 to 12,000 feet AGL. The IP susta ined major ba ck and throat injuries, and the SP sustained
     major chest and abdominal injuries. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 17. Flight Control Malfunction—Area.




     17.2. Investigation:
        17.2.1. Logistics Factor. The manufacturer’s quality assurance procedures were inadequate. The
        manufacturer failed to ensure the left aileron servo- valve assembly was manufactured to desi gn
        specifications. As a result , the le ft aileron servo-valve spool wa s not properly aged and became
        bowed during subsequent operation. The bowed spool caused binding and introduced a downward
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                    33


       force on the assembly, driving the left aileron to the full down position and rendering the aircraft
       uncontrollable.
   17.3. Lesson Learned. Pilots are keenly aware of the many human factors issues that can detract
   from the safe conduct of a missi on. This mishap demonstrates that manufacturers and quality assur-
   ance personnel are equally susceptible.
   17.4. Action Taken. Reviewed quality control procedures on aileron servo valves and spools to
   ensure design specifications were met.

18. Flight Control Malfunction—Area:
   18.1. Mishap (Figure 18.). The mishap aircraft was on a local instrument training mission. After lev-
   eloff at 22,000 feet, the SP initiated a descending right turn, but was unable to stop the right roll after
   entering the turn. The IP took co ntrol of the aircraft, reduced airspeed, and re gained partial control
   after several right rolls. The IP had marginal control authority with full left aileron and full left rudder.
   Two chase ai rcraft confirmed both ailerons were flush with the flap s, which were set at 60 percent.
   The crew maintained control of the aircraft for 43 minutes while discussing possible options with
   operations supervision. The aircrew elected to eject versus attemptin g to land. The IP began a right
   turn to proceed to the controlled bailout area. During the turn, the aircraft continued rolling right and
   would not recover. (The aircraft was at 19,000 feet and 180 KIAS.) The IP ordered ejection, and both
   crewmembers ejected successfully with only minor injuries. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 18. Flight Control Malfunction—Area.




   18.2. Investigation (Maintenance Factor). At an unknown time, mainte nance personnel removed
   the cotter pin securing a screw in the left aileron operating mechanism, but did not replace it. The left
   aileron operating mechanism became disconnected during the flight, allowing the left aileron to move
   full down. The aircrew eventually lost control of the aircraft and ejected.
   18.3. Lesson Learned. It is impossible to provide definitiv e guidance for every aileron malfunction
   or for any other type of flight control malfunction, for that matter. Before commanding ejection, the IP
   made several logical attempts to regain control. If you have the time, contact the operations supervisor
   or the supervi sor of f lying (SOF) to help analyze the situation and develop alternative courses of
   action.
   18.4. Action Taken. Developed aileron operating mechanism inspection procedures to reduce the
   probability of similar mishaps.
34                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


19. Structural Failure—Area:
     19.1. Mishap (Figure 19.). The mission was a pre-solo contact so rtie. Takeoff and departure to the
     low-altitude training area were uneventful. After approximately 32 minutes, the controlling agency
     lost radar contact and notified the aircraft’s home base. Another aircraft was vectored into the area and
     found the wreckage. The IP was fatally injured during the high-speed ejection, the FP sustained major
     injuries, and the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 19. Structural Failure—Area.




     19.2. Investigation (Logistics Factor). Tool marks were introduc ed on the vertical face of the left
     wing root, most probably during wing manufacture. A fatigue crack developed from the tool mark that
     maintenance failed to detect. Maintenance, nondestructive inspection (NDI) training practices, visual
     inspections, and NDI inspections were inadequate. The left wing fail ed under a 4 to 5 G load during
     the mishap sortie.
     19.3. Lesson Learned. The maintenance TOs did not communicat e the requirement to identify and
     report tool marks on the vertical surface of the wing root. Althou gh aircrews do not have the equip-
     ment or expertise to detect every potential source of fatigue, they must be vi gilant for scratches, tool
     marks, etc., on critical, load-bearing structures such as the wing root radius.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              35


   19.4. Action Taken:
      19.4.1. Reduced maximum allowable aircraft G until TO requirements were met.
      19.4.2. Provided additional training to NDI specialists for T-38 wing root radii inspections.
      19.4.3. Developed follow-on trai ning program, certific ation, and recertification procedure to
      ensure that NDI specialists maintain proficiency.
      19.4.4. Reevaluated T-38 egress system for reliability and survivability at a high airspeed.

20. Dual Engine Flameout:
   20.1. Mishap (Figure 20.). The mishap sortie was a pre-so lo contact mission, including a heavy-
   weight single-engine approach, mi ssed approach, and initial acroba tic maneuvers in the area. The IP
   was flying the aircraft and s etting up the next maneuver when the master cau tion light illuminated.
   Parameters were 90 degrees of left bank, military power, nose above the horizon, airspeed decreasing
   through 240 KIAS, and 17,000 feet. The IP noticed both left and right rpm and exhaust gas tempera-
   ture (EGT) gauges decreasing, pulled both throttles to idle, and pus hed both start buttons. He main-
   tained about 150 KIAS during several more normal air start attempts. The IP then cycled both throttles
   in and out of MAX afterburner a nd directed the SP to check the boost pump circuit breakers and
   ensure his throttles were in MAX. The SP then began to cycle his throttles in and out of MAX. The IP
   told the SP he was going to eject and for him to follow. The aircraft pitched down after the IP ejected.
   The SP assumed control and attempte d several air starts before ejecting himself. During the descent,
   the T-38 passed beneath the IP close enough for him to hear the engines running. The IP and SP were
   both uninjured. The aircraft was discovered in a wooded area 4 days later, destroyed upon impact.

Figure 20. Dual Engine Flameout.




     20.2. Investigation:
        20.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The governing directive that covers the monitoring of SPs identified
        as instructor pilot/fighter/ attack/reconnaissance (IP/FAR) qualified was inadequate. While a stu-
        dent in unde rgraduate pilot training (UPT), the mishap IP was IP/F AR qualified and selected to
        become a T-38 first assignment IP (FAIP). However, during the period from his IP/FAR qualifica-
        tion to his graduation from UPT, his performance deteriorated significantly.
        20.2.2. Supervisory Factor. Unit supervisors counseled the pilo t, but failed to change his IP/
        FAR qualification IAW the governing directive. Inadequate guidance regarding the monitoring of
        IP/FAR-qualified students contributed to the problem. Prior to the mishap, the IP had not encoun-
        tered any situation that would highlight his inability to handle an emergency or other stressful sit-
        uation.
        20.2.3. Logistics Factor. It appears the right boost pump failed due to an undetermined electrical
        interruption, flaming out the ri ght engine. The left engi ne rpm dropped below generator cut-in
        speed, most likely due to idle decay.
        20.2.4. Operator Factor. The IP failed to take proper emergency actions, to include maintaining
        aircraft control, analyzing the situation, and referring to the checklist. Apprehension and channel-
        ized attention were contributing factors. The IP held the aircraft in a low-speed (150 KIAS),
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                37


      high-sink condition outside the air start envelope, which disrupted his air start attempts. After the
      crew ejected, the aircraft gained airspeed and both engines restarted.
   20.3. Lesson Learned. Air start procedures are well defined, but the IP made crucial errors when
   faced with a stressful situation. The only way to combat the effects of stress is to maintain a very high
   level of proficiency. Supervisors must ensure IPs get enough emergency procedures training to reach
   the required level of proficiency. Additionally, supervisors must assess each student’s ability to cope
   with stress prior to and after IP /FAR qualification. Because it is hard to define objective criteria
   regarding “grace under pressure,” supervisors have to use subjective criteria and their personal judg-
   ment when evaluating an SP’s ability.
   20.4. Action Taken. Expanded governing directiv e to include proper moni toring of SPs after the
   advanced training recommendation board (ATRB).

21. Left Hydraulic Failure and Right Engine Shutdown:
   21.1. Mishap (Figure 21.). The mishap aircraft was on a single -ship functional check flight (FCF).
   The pilot noted right engine anomalies during the inverted foreign object check. He rolled the aircraft
   upright and attempted to correc t the engine malfunction. The pilo t shut down the engine and then
   noticed an illuminated left hydraulic warning light with corresponding zero pressure. He still had right
   hydraulic pressure from the windmilling engine, but it wouldn’t be sufficient to land. He made several
   unsuccessful attempts to restart the right eng ine and then decided to go to the controlled bailout area
   to eject. He ejected successfully, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 21. Left Hydraulic Failure and Right Engine Shutdown.




   21.2. Investigation:
      21.2.1. Maintenance Factor. A maintenance specialist incorrec tly installed the left hydraulic
      system reservoir cap. The cap cam e loose during engine runup for takeoff. As a result, the left
      hydraulic system reservoir was unpressurized. Using the speed brakes and landing gear during the
      FCF profile resulted in momentary cavitations of the left hydraulic pump. These cavitations were
38                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        also accompanied by momentary illum inations of the master caution and left hydraulic caution
        lights.
        21.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The pilot did not consider the momentar y illumination of the lef t
        hydraulic caution light to be critical, and he continued the mission. The fact it was an FCF and not
        a training sortie may have contributed to hi s decision. Flight manual guidance was al so inade-
        quate. The left hydraulic reservoir lost enough fl uid during the subsequent inverted negative G
        flight to cause a system failure.
        21.2.3. Logistics Factor. The right main fuel control malfunc tioned during inverted flight for an
        undetermined reason, resulting in loss of throttle response.
        21.2.4. Operator Factor. The pilot failed to full y analyze the situation. He shut down the right
        engine before realizing the left hydraulic system had failed. The main fuel control malfunction
        prevented a successful air start. The pilot then correctly determined he could not land the aircraft
        safely.
     21.3. Lesson Learned. Mishaps are usually the result of a chain of events. If you can break the chain
     at any of the links, the mishap can be prevented. In this case, the pilot failed to thoroughly analyze the
     situation. If he had, he might have come up with a different “game plan,” which would have allowed
     him to recover the aircraft.
     21.4. Action Taken:
        21.4.1. Added the following note to TO 1T-38A-l: “NOTE: Momentary drops in pressure suf fi-
        cient to cause illumination of the hydraulic caution light may be an indication of an unpressurized
        system. Land as soon as conditions permit. Avoid zero or negative G flight to prevent fluid loss.”
        21.4.2. Added the following warning to TO IT-38A-1:


                                                WARNING
         Do not attempt to land the aircraft when a windmilling engine is providing the only source
         of hydraulic pressure.

22. Flight Control Malfunction:
     22.1. Mishap (Figure 22.). The aircraft was on an FCF following replaceme nt of the Number 1
     engine main fuel pump. During the sortie, the airc raft impacted the ground, and the pilot was fatally
     injured.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               39


Figure 22. Flight Control Malfunction.




   22.2. Investigation:
      22.2.1. Supervisory Factor. Logistics managers failed to identify the machine screws in the dif-
      ferential link of the horizontal ta il mechanism as critical flight control components. The screws
      should have had self-locking nuts in addition to cotter pins to provide adequate redundancy.
      22.2.2. Maintenance Factor. The mechanic trainee who installed the machine screws did not
      install the required cotter pin IAW technical data. The dock supervisor and quality control inspec-
      tor both failed to notice the discre pancy. The unsecured nut eventually backed of f and the screw
      came out during flight, allowing the horizontal tail surface to move to a full nose-down position.
      22.2.3. Operator Factor. The pilot ejected outside the safe ejection envelope and was fatally
      injured.
   22.3. Lesson Learned. Logistics personnel have designed checklists, procedures, and inspections to
   minimize the risk of human error and prevent mishaps. However, work force attitude plays a big part
   in conducting a successful and safe operation. Professionalism and disciplined adherence to technical
   data is critical, and the conseque nces of sloppy work can be catastr ophic. Additionally, the pilot was
   most likely di stracted by the nature of t he emergency and may ha ve delayed his ejec tion. If a brupt,
   uncommanded aircraft maneuvers are not immediat ely controllable, you may not be able to regain
   control at all. Delaying ejection may place you at greater risk of injury.
   22.4. Action Taken:
      22.4.1. Required self-locking castellated nuts on all critical flight control components.
40                                                                    AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        22.4.2. Revised the periodic inspection work card to include a picture of the horizontal tail mech-
        anism and the following warning:


                                                WARNING
         Failure to properly install cotter pins and sa fety wire c an cause loss of airc raft and
         possible fatal injury to the aircrew.

        22.4.3. Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Center, reviewed other weapons systems to ensure crit-
        ical flight control components had redundant locking systems when possible.

23. Flight Control Malfunction—Pattern:
     23.1. Mishap (Figure 23.). The mishap aircraft was on a solo student training mission. Once back in
     the traffic pattern, the SP heard a loud bang when he extended the gear and flaps on inside downwind.
     Thinking it was a compr essor stall, he scanned th e engine instruments to identify the malfunction.
     When he looked back outside, the aircraft was nearly inverted. The SP decided to eject, but had some
     difficulty reaching the ejection handles. The a ircraft completed roughly two and half revolutions
     before the SP finally ejected. He was uninjured, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 23. Flight Control Malfunction—Pattern.




     23.2. Investigation:
        23.2.1. Supervisory Factor. T-38 flap actuator rod end failures had been documented as early as
        5 years before this mishap. The system manager not ed an increase in failures 2 years before the
        mishap. Logistics manage rs started the process to design and procure an improved rod end, but
        they did not update the technical data concerning the old rod ends. Specific issues were:
            23.2.1.1. The assigned time change interval did not provide an adequate safety margin to pre-
            vent fatigue failures.
            23.2.1.2. The length of the periodic visual inspection interval prevented the timely detection
            of fatigue cracks.
            23.2.1.3. TO guidance did not require NDI of the rod ends, and the prescribed visual inspec-
            tion procedure was inadequate to detect cracks.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                  41


      23.2.2. Logistics Factor. The right flap actuator rod end de veloped a fatigue crack. The fatigue
      crack gradually grew, weakening the rod end. During the mishap sort ie, the rod end failed as the
      flaps were lowered for landing.
      23.2.3. Operator Factor. The SP delayed using aileron to count er the roll (or used insuf ficient
      aileron) and allowed the aircraft to enter a nose low attitude. Channelized attention was a contrib-
      uting factor. The SP ejected as the aircraft rolled past 135 de grees of bank and in a 25- to
      30-degree dive.
   23.3. Lesson Learned. Although flap rod ends had failed prior to this mishap, the seriousness of this
   malfunction was underestimated. No ai rcraft were lost in the previous instances due to pilot experi-
   ence and the timing of the failures. (F instance, one failed in the fina turn; but, luckily, it was the top
                                          or                               l
   wing. This caused the aircraft to roll out versus rolling over.) The SP’s inexperience played a part in
   this mishap. He did not apply the first basic rule—maintain aircraft control. However, bad timing also
   played a part.
   23.4. Action Taken:
      23.4.1. Incorporated critical action emergency procedures into TO IT-38A-1, emphasizing the dif-
      ferent types of flap asymmetry and the need for immediate pilot action to recover the aircraft.
      23.4.2. Reduced the time change inte rval on flap rod ends to mini mize the possibility of fatigue
      failure.
      23.4.3. Established adequate NDI procedures to detect fatigue cracks in flap rod ends.
      23.4.4. Procured newly designed flap rod ends and expedited T-38 and F-5 retrofit.

24. Structural Failure—Area:
   24.1. Mishap (Figure 24.). The mission was an advanced contact student training sortie. Takeoff and
   departure to the working area were uneventful. After completing several aerobatic maneuvers, the air-
   crew initiated a loop at 500 KIAS and 5.5 Gs. The left wing fail ed, and the aircraft immediately
   departed controlled flight. Both crewmembers ejected successfully, and the aircraft was destroyed
   upon impact.
42                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 24. Structural Failure—Area.




     24.2. Investigation:
        24.2.1. Logistics Factor. The mishap wing was an older , thin-skin design. The lower left wing
        developed a fatigue crack at a “jo” bolt fastener, which ultimately failed under tension during the
        5.5 G 1oop. NDI ultrasonic rotoscan procedures previously failed to identify the crack.
     24.3. Lesson Learned. The thin-skin wings we re susceptible to fatigue cr acks, and all were being
     replaced with thicker skin wings. Although the ro toscan procedure was demanding and dif ficult to
     perform, it was the only available procedure to detect the early stages of wing skin cracks.
     24.4. Action Taken:
        24.4.1. Replaced all thin-skin wings with thicker-skin wings.
        24.4.2. Established an advisory board to evaluate rotoscan proced ures and review the develop-
        ment of advanced NDI equipment. A fixture wa s being developed to support the rotoscan unit,
        which will reduce operator fatigue . A new digital ultras onic system with a vi deo recording capa-
        bility will improve NDI inspections and provide a permanent record of inspection results.

25. Bird Strike—Low-Level Sortie:
     25.1. Mishap (Figure 25.). The mission was a two-ship low-level navigation sortie. The mishap air-
     craft (lead) was flying a syllabus support sortie flown by two IPs. Approximately halfway through the
     low level, a bird penetrated the front windscreen, fatally injuring the IP in the front seat. The IP in the
     rear seat was not injured and recovered the aircraft with assistance from the wingman.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                   43


Figure 25. Bird Strike—Low-Level Sortie.




   25.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The mishap cr ew saw birds twice on the low level prior to
   the mishap. In one instance, the front seat IP assumed control and maneuvered the aircraft to avoid a
   bird. Approximately 6 minu tes later, an adult tur key vulture penetrated the windscreen. The mishap
   aircraft was in straight-and-leve l flight, 500 feet AGL, and travel ing at 400 KIAS. The front seat IP
   received fatal head injuries from bird and windscreen debris.
   25.3. Lesson Learned:
      25.3.1. Birds have always posed a threat to aviato The crew only had about 3.6 seconds to react,
                                                         rs.
      taking aircraft speed and bird size into account. That gave the pilot 3.6 seconds to see the bird,
      assess the collision potential, make a decision, and move the controls in sufficient time for the air-
      craft to move far enough to avoid hitting the bird.
      25.3.2. Reducing the airspeed gives both the pilot and the bird more time to react. Changes in
      lighting and the size of the bird also impacts the ability to acquire the threat and may reduce avail-
      able reaction time.
   25.4. Action Taken:
      25.4.1. Procured new windscreen and frame assemblies.
      25.4.2. Prohibited solo low-level sorties.
      25.4.3. Reduced maximum allowable speed on low-level routes.

26. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction:
   26.1. Mishap (Figure 26.). The mission was a solo FCF. During a 4 G turn at flight level (FL) 210,
   the pilot felt something “let go” in the flight control system. He tried to gain control of the aircraft for
   approximately 5 minutes by lowering the gear and flap s, but the aircraft remained in a nose low, left
   hand spiral. The pilot told the SOF and radar approa ch control (RAPCON) that he planned to eject,
   and he bailed out approaching 6,000 feet AGL. He received minor injuries during the ejection due to
   improper body position and again during the parachute-landing fall when he impacted some trees. (He
   did not perform the four-line jettison.) The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.
44                                                                    AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 26. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction.




     26.2. Investigation:
        26.2.1. Logistics and Material Factor. A design deficiency in the T -38 flight control system
        allowed a single point failure of the cable assembly of the horizontal tail control mechanism.
        26.2.2. Logistic and Material Factor. The “A” cable in the horizo ntal tail control mechanism
        separated due to material failure and/or improper maintenance.
     26.3. Lessons Learned:
        26.3.1. Although investigators could not determine exactly why the “A” cable failed, the mishap
        highlighted a design deficiency th at allowed a single point of fa ilure. (A failure of one of four
        cables resulted in the loss of an aircraft.)
        26.3.2. Pilots must always mental ly rehearse ejection procedures when practicing emer gencies
        and make sure to consider the proper body position and post-ejection actions.
     26.4. Action Taken:
        26.4.1. Recommended engineers eval uate feasibility of redesigning the horizontal tail control
        mechanism (for example, add redundancy) to prevent a single point failure.
        26.4.2. Recommended replacing the horizontal tail control mechanism cables of all T-38s during
        the PE and every fourth PE ther eafter. Requested inspection of th e horizontal tail control mecha-
        nism cables during the challenge and response checklist for panel #47.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              45


27. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction:
   27.1. Mishap (Figure 27.). The mishap sortie was a two-ship formation check ride. During the G
   warmup maneuver, the mishap aircraft executed a smooth uncommanded pitchup. The IP initiated a
   nose high recovery, but the a ircraft entered a left turn and would not respond to c ontrol inputs. The
   crew ejected successfully, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 27. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction.




   27.2. Investigation:
      27.2.1. Logistics Factor. The Air Fo rce accepted th e T-38 flight control system design, even
      though the design allowed for multiple single point failures in each of its three axies.
      27.2.2. Logistics Factor:
46                                                                        AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


            27.2.2.1. The design of the horizontal stabilator actuator servo valve control rod assembly is
            insufficient and does not prevent fatigue failures during the life of the assembly.
            27.2.2.2. The T-38 system manager failed to imple ment inspection criteria or a time change
            interval for the horizontal stabilator actuator servo valve control rod assembly despite a report
            many years earlier that highlighted the T -38’s susceptibility to catastrophic single point fail-
            ures in the flight control system. By default, the rod assembly became a fly-to-fail part with no
            backup system. During this mishap, the ends of the stabilator actuator servo valve control rod
            failed due to undetected, high cycle fatigue.
     27.3. Lesson Learned. Lessons learned from prev ious incidents and accidents went unheeded,
     resulting in an additional loss of aircraft and near loss of life. The lessons lear ned from aircraft mis-
     haps are often paid for in blood, so we must learn from the experience of others. Take those lessons to
     heart so you do not have to pay the price yourself.
     27.4. Action Taken:
        27.4.1. Conducted a one-time inspection of all T-38 servo valve rod ends.
        27.4.2. Recommended establishing service life criteria for the entire horizontal stabilator actuator
        servo valve control rod assembly . Evaluated procedures and time change intervals for the rod
        assembly of th e horizontal stabilator actuator servo valve control. These recommendations were
        for all single-point failure locations.
        27.4.3. Recommended expanding existing Air Force directives regarding requirements for service
        life extension programs to include aging aircraft issues not relate d to primary structural elements
        and components.

Section C—Disorientation and Loss-of-Control Mishaps

28. Loss of Control—Traffic Pattern Stalls:
     28.1. Mishap (Figure 28.). The mission was a pre-solo contact sortie. The SP was practicing no-flap
     traffic pattern stalls in the area. He lowered the gear and begana right turn at 19,000 feet MSL. He ini-
     tiated the recovery at the first stall indication by applying left ai leron and selecting maximum after-
     burner. At fir st, the a ircraft rolled farther right, but then it rolled left past wings level until it was
     inverted. The IP assumed control and made anti-spin control inputs (left aileron, back stick, and full
     right rudder). The aircraft started oscillating with rapid roll rates and lar ge pitch changes, exceeding
     both positive and negative load-factor limits. Both crewmembers ejected successfully, but the aircraft
     was destroyed upon impact.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               47


Figure 28. Loss of Control—Traffic Pattern Stalls.




   28.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The IP misinterpreted the airc raft response as a spin and
   caused the oscillations with his anti-spin contro l inputs. He became severely disoriented, determined
   recovery was not possible, and ordered ejection.
   28.3. Lesson Learned. The possibility of a T-38 entering a true spin is extremely remote. Applying
   anti-spin controls when no spin exists will result in cross-control oscillations and severe disorienta-
   tion.
   28.4. Action Taken:
      28.4.1. Expanded the TO 1T-38A-l description of stalls, spins, and recovery techniques to include
      a variety of stalls, gyrations, and other maneuvers that could be misinterpreted as spins.
      28.4.2. Revised the governing directive to state, “I severe wing rock occurs, immediately execute
                                                         f
      stall recovery procedures.”

29. Loss of Control—Intercom Failure:
   29.1. Mishap (Figure 29.). This mishap occurred during a day-night, out-and-back navigation train-
   ing mission. The aircraft departed on the return leg just after sunset . On takeoff, the IP (in the RCP)
   experienced a complete loss of intercom and ultra high frequenc y (UHF) radio, observed the master
   caution light momentarily illuminate, and assumed control of the aircraft. Although the IP briefed the
   SP before flight that he (the IP) would assume airc raft control in this contingency , the SP failed to
   relinquish the controls because he believed the IP was giving him a simula ted emergency procedure.
   Meanwhile, the IP attempted to maneuver the aircraft for a visual landing. The SP’s continued control
   inputs eventually led the IP to believe the flight controls were malfunctioni ng and a loss of cont rol
   was imminent. The IP ejected, followed immediately by the SP.

Figure 29. Loss of Control—Intercom Failure.




     29.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP failed to relinquish contro l of the aircraft as briefed
     and vigorously oppos ed the IP’s control inputs, which caus ed the IP to believe loss of control was
     imminent.
     29.3. Lesson Learned. The loss of intercockpit communications in a dual control tandem aircraft
     seldom results in a major accident. Nevertheless, this mi shap proves it can ha ppen! IPs must ensure
     SPs are thoroughly briefed on what toexpect and what is expected of them following intercom failure.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                49


   29.4. Action Taken:
      29.4.1. Amplified transfer of aircra ft control procedures in the gove rning directive to clarify air-
      crew guidance on intercom failure. Additionally, added the following:


                                                CAUTION
       Transfer of aircraft control without intercom can result in disastrous crew confusion if not
       done in a positive prebriefed manner. If there is any con fusion, the aircraft commander
       must be prepared to immediately assume control. If you, as the other crewmember, at any
       time feel an unexpected pressure on the stick, momentarily relax your grip to determine if
       the aircraft commander is attempting to take control. Aircrew confusion can result in two
       extremely hazardous situations, one in which neither crewmember is flying the aircraft
       and the other in which both crewmembers are fighting for the controls. Both conditions
       are potentially disastrous.

      29.4.2. Made transfer of aircraft control procedures a mandatory briefing item.

30. Loss of Control—Area:
   30.1. Mishap (Figure 30.). The mishap sortie was a solo cont act mission, which included aerobatic
   maneuvers in the local area and normal traffic patterns and landings back at the field. Air traffic con-
   trol lost radar contact with the aircraft approximately 13 minutes after it arrived in the assigned area.
   Subsequent investigation revealed the aircraft impacted the ground nearly vertical at high speed. The
   SP had not attempted to eject and was fatally injured.
50                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 30. Loss of Control—Area.




     30.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). Eyewitness statements indicate the SP was performing aero-
     batic maneuvers below the minimum established altitude. While attempting a high performance aero-
     batic maneuver, the SP placed the ai rcraft in a high-speed, vertical dive with insufficient altitude to
     recover.
     30.3. Lesson Learned:
        30.3.1. Simple errors (like misreading the 10,000 foot increment on the altimeter) while perform-
        ing usual aerobatic maneuvers coul d place a student in a high speed dive w ith little altitude to
        recover.
        30.3.2. Be sure to double check the altimeter a nd airspeed before be ginning each maneuver and
        during the maneuver. If the parameters do not look right, immediately abort the maneuver and exe-
        cute the appropriate recovery . Be sure you unde rstand the dive recovery charts i n the T O
        1T-38A-1, Flight Manual (AF 59-1603 and Later Aircraft), and have a plan on how to execute a
        high-speed, dive recovery.
     30.4. Action Taken. Conducted a study of procedures that controlling agencies will use to: (1) chal-
     lenge aircraft not displaying altit ude readout to verify their Mode C capability, and (2) visually con-
     firm the pilot’s reported altitude with the altitude readout displayed on the radar equipment on each
     handoff.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                   51


31. Disorientation—Night Pattern:
   31.1. Mishap (Figure 31.). The mishap aircraft was on an initial night solo mission. Once estab-
   lished in the traffic pattern, the SP broke out on initial due to a traffic conflict. Approaching the visual
   flight rules (VFR) entry point, the SP descended from the breakout altitude and started a turn away
   from the entry point. The aircraft was last observed in a wings level descent on the 90-degree leg to
   initial before impacting the ground. The SP made no attempt to eject and was fatally injured. The air-
   craft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 31. Disorientation—Night Pattern.




   31.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP probably became disoriented due to G forces, visual
   illusions, limited visual cues, and limited night experience.
   31.3. Lesson Learned. Many of the optical cues (such as de pth perception or motion cues) we rely
   on for attitude awareness are not present at night, making us highly susceptible to unrecognized spa-
   tial disorientation, especially while performing visual maneuvers. It is imperative to rely primarily on
   the instruments at night, even while flying a visual pattern.
   31.4. Action Taken. Changed the command syllabus to re quire a night bre akout and traffic pattern
   reentry prior to flying a night solo mission.

32. Loss of Control—Area:
   32.1. Mishap (Figure 32.). The mission wa s the SP’s last UPT sortie. After leveloff at 23,000 feet,
   the IP assumed aircr aft control, flew into the area, and executed an aileron roll and split S. The IP
   returned aircraft control to the SP, who began an Immelman. The SP selected afterburners and began
   a high G pull at 350 knots to initiate the Immelman, exceeding aircraft G limits in the process. The SP
   stated his intention to lower the flaps at approximately 30 to 45 degrees nose high and 300 knots. As
   the aircraft approached 15 0 knots and pure vertical, the IP took control of the aircraft to attempt a
52                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     recovery. The aircraft conti nued upward, and the a irspeed decreased rapidly. The aircraft departed
     controlled flight at 25,500 feet MSL. The IP made several attempts to recover the aircraft, but all were
     unsuccessful. The SP ejected at 9,500 feet AGL, and the IP ejected at 2,000 feet AGL. Neither crew-
     member was injured, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 32. Loss of Control—Area.




     32.2. Investigation:
        32.2.1. Operator Factor. The SP initiated an Immelman w ell below the minimum pr escribed
        entry airspeed. In addition, he overstressed the aircraft on pullup.
        32.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to assume control of the aircraft in a timely manner. In
        addition, he used improper procedures to recover from vertical flight.
     32.3. Lesson Learned. The IP was complacent, which delayed him from taking the aircraft at the
     appropriate time. The SP had comple ted all required evaluation sorties and would most likely be the
     outstanding graduate. The IP had fl own with him many times and considered him the best student in
     his flight.
     32.4. Action Taken. Prohibited the use of flaps during aerobatic maneuvers.

33. Loss of Control—Area:
     33.1. Mishap (Figure 33.). The mishap aircraft was on a single-ship team sortie (two students). The
     SP in the RCP was acting as an observer. Takeoff and departure to the working area were uneventful.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                53


   Thirteen minutes after the crew entered the area, airtraffic control lost radar and radio contact. The SP
   in the FCP had attempted a high speed ejection, but was fatally injured. The SP in the RCP had not
   ejected and was also fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 33. Loss of Control—Area.




   33.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). It appears the SP in the FCP entered a high-speed dive dur-
   ing the last portion of a barrel roll, possibly due to disorientation. He determined recovery was impos-
   sible. He ejected at high speed and sustained fatal injuries during the ejection.
   33.3. Lesson Learned. Disorientation seems to be the most plausible explanation and is supported
   by SP’s previous performance al ong with the planned maneuvers and prevailing s ky conditions for
   this mission. Fatigue may have intensified the disorientation. The SP was pushing the flight duty lim-
   itation (12 hours) with a long day of activity (nearly 11 hours, including two academic classes, a phys-
   ical training period, and two flights).
   33.4. Action Taken. Established policies enforcing compliance with flight and duty restrictions to
   ensure pilots obtain proper crew rest.

34. Loss of Control—Night Cruise:
   34.1. Mishap (Figure 34.). The mission was a single-ship, navi gation flight eval uation. After 40
   minutes of uneventful flight, the aircrew declaredan emergency for a flight control problem. The crew
   started a descent and proc eeded to an emer gency airfield. During the descent, the IP transmitted the
   crew’s intention to eject. Both crewmembers ejected successfully and were uninjured, but the aircraft
   was destroyed upon impact.
54                                                                    AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 34. Loss of Control—Night Cruise.




     34.2. Investigation:
        34.2.1. Logistics Factor. An undetermined compon ent of the stability au gmenter system (SAS)
        malfunctioned during straight-and-level, unaccelerated flight. The ai rcraft suddenly yawed to the
        left and then began rolling left.
        34.2.2. Operator Factor. After assuming control of the aircraft, the IP failed to fully evaluate the
        flight control abnormality and incorrectly assumed the left rolling tendency was caused by an aile-
        ron control malfunction. The IP may have jumped to this conclusion based on his knowledge of a
        previous T-38 aircraft mishap caused by an aileron disconnect.
        34.2.3. Operator Factor. During the descent, the SP improperly interpreted a shake of the con-
        trol stick as a nonverbal signal transferring aircraft control to him, even though the intercom was
        working perfectly. The SP attempted to assume control of the aircraft, unknowingly applying con-
        trol inputs in opposition to the IP.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                  55


      34.2.4. Operator Factor. The IP did not recognize the conflicting control stick inputs as coming
      from the SP and assumed the supposed aileron control malfunction had degraded enough to pre-
      vent a safe landing. The IP directed ejection, and both crewmembers ejected successfully.
   34.3. Lesson Learned. Because the IP had recently lost a friend in a misha p caused by an aileron
   malfunction, he may have had a perceptual set that led him to misinterpret this malfunction as aileron
   induced. A stability augmenter malfunction could easily be misinterpreted as an aileron malfunction.
   Therefore, if practical, get a chase ship or just look outside at the wings to determine if the ailerons are
   responding appropriately. That is, thoroughly analyze the indications when time and conditions per-
   mit. In addition, improper transfer of aircraft cont rol has caused several aircraft losses so be sure to
   discuss verbal and nonverbal transfers in detail.
   34.4. Action Taken:
      34.4.1. Expanded the tr ansfer of air craft control procedures in the govern ing directive and
      changed the paragraph on intercom failure or transfer of control to read: “Under some unique cir-
      cumstances, subsequent transfer of control may be necessary. Walking the rudder pedals or yaw-
      ing the aircraft will in dicate transfer of aircr aft control to the other ai rcrew member who will
      acknowledge control by a noticeable shaking of the stick. These unique circumstances must be
      thoroughly briefed.”
      34.4.2. Revised the T -38 syllabus to specifically include a requi rement to demonstrate proper
      transfer of aircraft control both with and without intercockpit communications.

35. Disorientation—Night Formation:
   35.1. Mishap (Figure 35.). The mission was a night formation sortie. The wingman called “breaking
   out” while the flight was in a shallow descent pass 16,000 feet MSL. The lead aircraft observed the
                                                        ing
   wingman descending in a left-hand turn with the afterburner selected. The wingman appeared to level
   off and retard the throttles from afterburner just prior to entering instrument meteorological conditions
   (IMC). Moments later, the lead ai rcraft pilot observed a fireball . He orbited the mishap site and
   reported the situation to local radar control and the SOF. Neither mishap crewmember had attempted
   to eject, and both were fatally injured.
56                                                                   AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 35. Disorientation—Night Formation.




     35.2. Investigation:
        35.2.1. Operator Factor. The mishap aircrew became spati ally disoriented prior to, during, or
        after the breakout due to one or more of the following:
            35.2.1.1. Weather conditions.
            35.2.1.2. Night formation.
            35.2.1.3. Mishap IP’s minimal training and experience in night formation.
            35.2.1.4. Rapid roll and/or G load associated with the breakout.
            35.2.1.5. Fatigue (third flight of the day).
        35.2.2. Environmental Factor. Meteorological conditions at the time of the crash were broken
        cloud layers from 1,500 to 25,000 feet with little-to-no moon illumination.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               57


   35.3. Lesson Learned:
      35.3.1. Although spatial disorientation is deadly, it can be defeated by a disciplined application of
      the proper procedures. Your inner ear and “the seat of your pants” will lie to you, but you can still
      recover the aircraft by making the instruments read correctly. The rules are simple, yet effective:
          35.3.1.1. Recognize. Something does not look right in your cross-check.
          35.3.1.2. Confirm. Ensure the primary and standby attitude directional indicators (ADI) both
          read the same.
          35.3.1.3. Recover. Make the ADIs read correct ly and then check that the other instruments
          have stabilized.
      35.3.2. The governing directive also states, “Upon losing sight of the leader or if unable to main-
      tain formation due to disorientation, the wingman will simultaneously execute the applicable lost
      wingman procedure, while transi tioning to instruments. Smooth a pplication of control inputs is
      imperative to minimize th e effects of spatial di sorientation.” Although the lost wingman proce-
      dures may be more applicable to IMC, the same procedures apply equally well during mar ginal
      VMC, whether day or night.
      35.3.3. Although this mishap involved a relatively inexperienced IP, the history of disorientation
      mishaps (44 in the previous 10 years) shows that e xperienced pilots are just as susceptible to dis-
      orientation.
   35.4. Action Taken:
      35.4.1. Reevaluated the requirement for a UPT night formation mission.
      35.4.2. Reevaluated the adequacy of IP training.
      35.4.3. Restricted SPs a nd IPs from flying night fo rmation missions on thei r third flight of the
      day.
      35.4.4. Added more airc raft instrument and spat ial disorientation training to command training
      programs.

36. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction:
   36.1. Mishap (Figure 36.). The mission was the SP’ s initial so lo formation flight, and he was
   assigned to lead the formation takeoff. During takeoff roll, the mishap aircraft appeared to overrotate
   and pitch up when breaking ground. The wingman moved abeam and then passed the mishap aircraft,
   losing sight. The mishap SP regained control of the aircraft and notified the wingman of a pitch con-
   trol problem. He regained the le ad and continued the departure. The SOF suggested the flight burn
   down fuel and come back for a straight-in approach. The SOF also suggested the SP do a controllabil-
   ity check with landing gear up and 60 percent flaps. The SP lowered the flaps at FL 190. The aircraft
   began to pitch up and then rolled into a steep le bank. The wingman initiated a breakout, losing sight
                                                    ft
   of the mishap aircraft. When the wingman reacquired the mishap aircraft, it was inverted, rotating, and
   descending. The SP ejected successfully, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 36. Loss of Control—Flight Control Malfunction.




     36.2. Investigation:
        36.2.1. Maintenance Factor. The flap and slab interconnect cable was not connected to the hori-
        zontal tail’s operating mechanism during installa tion of the boat tail the night before the mishap
        sortie. Additionally, the required post-maintenance inspections failed to identify the discrepancy.
        36.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP and crew chief did not check for proper movement of the flaps
        and slabs IAW appropriate checklists.
        36.2.3. Operator Factor. The mishap SP failed to properly analyze the situation and prov ide an
        accurate and complete descript ion of the conditions to his wi ngman IP or the SOF . The SP
        extended the speed brakes to expedite fuel burn, which compressed the time available for analysis.
        36.2.4. Supervisory Factor. TO lT-38A-l does not adequately ad dress the characteristics of flap
        and slab interconnect failure. Additionally , the structural damage or controllability check proce-
        dure contained misleading guidance if applied to suspected flap and slab interconnect problems.
        36.2.5. Supervisory Factor. Neither the wingman IP or the SO F adequately analyzed the mal -
        function. This led the SOF to suggest lowering the flaps during the controllability check.
        36.2.6. Operator Factor. During the controllability check, the SP failed to maintain aircraft con-
        trol. The aircraft probably entered a stall as the flaps extended. Delayed pilot reaction or incorrect
        flight control inputs to recover the aircraft may have led to the loss of control.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               59


   36.3. Lesson Learned:
      36.3.1. This mishap resulted from a series of errors, similar to links in a chain. Breaking one link
      or eliminating even one error would have prevented the mishap.
      36.3.2. The first link in the chain involved main tenance errors. Maintenance personnel failed to
      connect the horizontal tail’s operating mechanism during installation of the boat tail, most likely
      due to complacency. This was their third boat tail installation on shift, and they may have rushed
      the job to get done before shift change. In addition, the quality control augmenter failed to use the
      two-man challenge and response checklist. Instead , he or she pe rformed the checklist without
      assistance and did not ensure all checks were accomplished.
      36.3.3. The second link broke when the SP failed to visually confirm slab movement as directed
      in the before-taxi checklist. He depended totally on the crew chief to ensure correct positioning of
      the slab, but the crew chief didnot confirm movement either. The SP failed to properly analyze the
      malfunction and eventually lost control of the aircraft.
      36.3.4. The third and final link in th chain occurred when the SOF and wingman IP failed to thor-
                                           e
      oughly analyze the malfunction. The SOF may have been overly concerned with the SP landing
      with no flaps due to inadequacies in TO 1T-38A-1 that lead the SOF to suggest lowering the flaps
      in the controllability check.
      36.3.5. Bottom line: Comply with th e checklist, visually confirm that your flight controls move
      correctly, and do not rely exclusively on ground personnel for confirmation.
   36.4. Action Taken:
      36.4.1. Expanded TO lT-38A-l guidance regarding the flap-horizontal tail interconnect system.
      36.4.2. Cha nged TO IT-38A-l to clarify the objectiv e of and the guidance for a controllability
      check.
      36.4.3. Changed maintenance T Os to require door #47 be sealed by the quality assurance team
      after completion of the challenge-and-response inspection following boat tail installation.
      36.4.4. Changed maintenance TOs to require an operational check of the flap-horizontal tail inter-
      connect system following boat tail installation.

37. Loss of Control—Area:
   37.1. Mishap (Figure 37.). The mission was a dual cont act sortie and the SP’s first ride in the T-38.
   Takeoff and departure were uneventful. The IP was demonstrating a split-S. As the aircraft
   approached a nose-low, inverted attitude, he sensed the nose was not tracking or the G-load increasing
   as expected. The IP made several attempts to regain the proper nose track with no perceptible success.
   He decided the aircraft could not be controlled and commanded a bailout. Both crewmembers ejected
   successfully, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.
60                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


Figure 37. Loss of Control—Area.




     37.2. Investigation:
        37.2.1. Unknown Factor. For an undetermined reason, the airc raft pitch trim actuator was posi-
        tioned to the full nose-down position. An electrical short in the contro l stick trim circuit, a stuck
        trim button, or an inadvertent pilot input may have induced the full nose-down trim position.
        37.2.2. Operator Factor. The IP was possibly distr acted by the lack of ai rcraft response to con-
        trol stick inputs and did not recognize the full nose-down trim position. He cycled the control stick
        rapidly fore and aft several times within a 3-second period in an unsuccessful attempt to regain air-
        craft control.
     37.3. Lesson Learned. When aircraft trim is full nose up or nose down, the stick forces required to
     position the horizontal stabilizer may be several times greater than what the pilot might expect. It will
     most likely require both hands on the control stick to execute a pr per recovery at low altitudes or dur-
                                                                        o
     ing a steep nose-low dive. In addition, heavy fuel weight will af fect AHCs as well as the altitude
     required to perform specific mane uvers. Crewmembers must be alert for unusual flight control and
     trim inputs, which can be disorienting because of their affect on the aircraft’s feel and performance.
     37.4. Action Taken:
        37.4.1. Changed the co mmand’s study guide, T-38 Instructor Techniques, to increase IP aware-
        ness of and ability to instruct trim malfunctions and other factors influencing aircraft performance.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                             61


      37.4.2. Incorporated a ground demons tration in the UPT and pilot instruction training (PIT) syl-
      labi to demonstrate the effects of full nose-down trim on stick forces required to achieve a known
      horizontal stabilizer response.

38. Ground Collision—Low Level:
   38.1. Mishap (Figure 38.). The mission was a dual, low-level stud ent training sortie flown in the
   local area. The aircrew departed VF R to the entry point and then obtai ned an instrument flight rules
   (IFR) clearance to fly the low le vel route in accordance with local filing procedures. The aircraft
   impacted the ground between points B and C of the low level route.Neither crewmember attempted to
   eject, and both were fatally injured. The aircraft impacted the ground and was destroyed.

Figure 38. Ground Collision—Low Level.




   38.2. Investigation:
      38.2.1. Supervision. Command directives did not provide adequate guidance for accomplishing
      route aborts when encountering IMC on low level navigation sorties.
      38.2.2. Supervisor Factor. Due to rapid changes in the flying schedule, the IP was sch eduled to
      fly a low-level mission at the last minute, with less time for mission preparation than required by
      governing directives. The flight and squadron supervisors were aware and approved.
      38.2.3. Operator Factor. The IP agreed to fly the low level without th e required mission prep
      time. The IP failed to ensure he and the student were properly prepared for the mission.
      38.2.4. Operator Factor. The aircrew continued the route de spite deteriorating weathe r condi-
      tions and inadvertently entered the weather. The aircrew mistake nly believed they had ade quate
      terrain clearance and initiated a shallow descent to regain VMC.
62                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     38.3. Lesson Learned:
        38.3.1. Minimum brief times are pres cribed for a reason. We cannot say for sure the crew would
        have used the extra minutes for planning or whether the extra time would have prevented this mis-
        hap. However, we can say the crew was not given the opportunity to adequately prepare.
        38.3.2. Low-level flying, particularly with mar ginal weather, can be extremely demanding. The
        surest way to gain a nd maintain situational aw areness on the route is good map preparation and
        study while still on the ground, but both take time. Be sure to study the terrai n and forecast
        weather conditions.
        38.3.3. In addition, treat entering IMC on a low-level route as an emergency situation. If you can-
        not avoid IMC, transition to in struments and immediately climb to your emergency route abort
        altitude. Do not attempt an IMC descent to re-establish VMC!
     38.4. Action Taken. Required an emergency route abort or exit es cape altitude for each low level
     route. This altitude provides 2,000 feet clearance from the highest obstacle within 25 nm of either side
     of course for the enti re low level route. ( Editor’s note: Computations for rout e abort altitudes have
     changed since this mishap. See the applicable directive for specifics.)

Section D—Formation Mishaps

39. Formation Approach—Runway Departure:
     39.1. Mishap (Figure 39.). The mission was a dual four-ship formation fl ight. The mishap crew
     experienced an electrical problem accompanied by sm oke in the cockpit. Th e FCP pilot turned of f
     both generators and the battery and the smoke subsided. One of the ot her aircraft led the mishap air-
     craft back to the final approach course, where the mishap crew configured for a no flap landing. The
     lead aircraft flew the final appr oach well above the recommended final approach airspeed. The mis-
     hap aircraft took the lead after gaining visual contact with the runway. It touched down approximately
     20 KIAS above the final approach airspeed (200 KIAS) and blew both main tires. The aircraft
     departed the left side of the runway 200 feet before departure end and struck an access road, shearing
     the right main gear. Both crewmembers egressed uneventfully and were uninjured.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               63


Figure 39. Formation Approach—Runway Departure.




   39.2. Investigation:
      39.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The lead aircraft placed the mishap aircraft in an unfavorable posi-
      tion for landing (high airspeed).
      39.2.2. Operator Factor. The mishap crew remained abov e final approach airspeed until after
      touchdown. High airspeed and an improper aerobrake blew the main tires and led to the loss of
      directional control.
   39.3. Lesson Learned. Having too much wingman consideration is a common flight lead error, par-
   ticularly when the wingman has a problem. The flight lead’s main task at this point is to safely recover
   the formation, which means flying a good approach. By being over ly concerned with his wingman,
   the flight lead failed to monitor his airspeed, which directly contributed to the mishap.
   39.4. Action Taken:
      39.4.1. Added the following caution to TO lT-38A-l:


                                                CAUTION
       Extreme caution must be exercised when applying wheel brakes above 120 KIAS as
       locked wheels or tire skids are difficult to recognize. If tire skid is detected, immediately
       release both brakes and cautiously reapply.

      39.4.2. Developed a distance chart for a no-flap landing.

40. Midair Collision—Breakout:
   40.1. Mishap (Figure 40.). The mishap mission was an IP-formation continuation training (CT) sor-
   tie. The flight was performing an extended-trail, lazy-eight maneuver. The wingman was on lead’ s
64                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     right side as the formation descended to enter the maneuver. During the descent to the start of the pul-
     lup, the wingman crossed behind lead to the left side. Lead pulled up into the nose high portion of the
     lazy eight and then began to roll left. On the inside of the tur n, the wingman closed to what he es ti-
     mated to be 1,000 feet and just aft of line abreast. Because he felt he was too far forward, constituting
     a hazard to the flight, he called “breaking out.” Both crews lost sight of each other during the breakout
     and collided. All four crewmembers ejected successfully, but both aircraft were destroyed.

Figure 40. Midair Collision—Breakout.




     40.2. Investigation:
        40.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The flight briefing did not adequa tely cover overshoot or breakout
        procedures from trail formation.
        40.2.2. Operator Factor. The wingman maneuvered into a hazardous position and failed to prop-
        erly execute a breakout.
     40.3. Lesson Learned:
        40.3.1. There are several lessons learned, most c oncerning the use of or reliance on mirrors to
        monitor the wingman. (At the time of this mishap, the T-38 was not equipped with mirrors.)
        40.3.2. First, all crewmembers must maintain sight during extended trail. As lead, your primary
        method for monitoring the wingman should be looking over your shoulder, using the mirrors as a
        last resort. If you lose sight as lead, ask fo r your wingman’s position. Maneuver predictably until
        you regain the visual or termin ate the maneuver. As a wingman, avoid flying near lead’ s six
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                65


      o’clock where it is ha rder to see. In general, if you have a clear view of lead’s canopy, he or she
      can see you. If you lose sight or need to break out of the formation, lag lead’s last known position.
      Always think about your “out” wh ile flying in formation. That is , think about where you need to
      maneuver the aircraft to avoid a collision if you lose sight or get too close.
      40.3.3. Second, there are several drawbacks to re lying on mirrors to monitor your wingman, so
      use them smartly. First drawback—it is very dif ficult to accurately assess your wingman’s range
      and closure, using the mirrors. Second drawback—the mirro rs provide only a limited field of
      view. If your wingman maneuvers outside that field of view it will be difficult for you to reacquire
                                                                  ,
      visual contact.
      40.3.4. One technique for using mirrors is to adjust them on the ground so you can just see part of
      your fuselage along the inner edge of the mirror. When airborne, fight to keep the visual by look-
      ing over your shoulder. However, if your wingman collapses to 6 o’clock, cross-check the mirror.
      If you have adjusted the mirror -properly, you should be able to see the wingma n. As he or she
      moves back toward the outside edge of the mirr or, look back over your shoulder to reacquire the
      wingman.
   40.4. Action Taken:
      40.4.1. Revised the governing directives to include the following:
          40.4.1.1. The maneuvering cone for trail formation, defined as a 60 degrees cone, 30 degrees
          out from the extended longitudinal axis of the lead aircraft. (Editor’s note: Extended trail cone
          has changed since this mishap. See applicable directives for details.)
          40.4.1.2. Wingman techniques regarding trail formation and breakout or overshoot proce-
          dures.
      40.4.2. Initiated action to retrofit the T-38 aircraft with rearview mirrors to improve the lead IP’s
      ability to monitor the wingman.

41. Midair Collision and Four-Ship Rejoin:
   41.1. Mishap (Figure 41.). The mishap mission was a four-ship formation training sortie. All aircraft
   were dual with IPs in the RCPs. T akeoff, departure, and area entry were uneventful. During the pro-
   file, the flight executed a pitchout for a left turning rejoin at 24,000 feet MSL. Lead was at 45 degrees
   of bank for the rejoin IA W the brief. Number 2 rejo ined uneventfully to lead’s left side. Numbers 3
   and 4 were aft of the normal rejoin line, placing th e lead element in the sun. Number 4 IP , who was
   flying the aircraft, lost sight of the lead element and asked the SP if he had them in sight. The SP said
   he did. Number 4 IP had sight of Number 3 and continued his rejoin. Number 3 crossed behind the
   lead element to the outside of the turn in a slight overshoot. Lead watched Number 4 stagnate momen-
   tarily on the inside of the turn and then cross under. Lead looked to the other side of the aircraft where
   he expected Number 4 to appear. In the meantime, Number 4 ha d moved behind Number 2 and con-
   tinued forward and up, striking Number 2 in the left aft section. Both aircraft sustained extensive dam-
   age. Number 4 SP was fatally injured in the collision. Number 4 IP suffered severe back injuries, but
   was able to eject. Both crewmembers in the Number 2 aircraft were able to eject without injury. Both
   aircraft were destroyed upon ground impact.

Figure 41. Midair Collision—Four-Ship Rejoin.




     41.2. Investigation:
        41.2.1. Supervisory Factor. Operational guidance was inadequate and implied element rejoins at
        altitude were permitted.
        41.2.2. Operator Factor. Number 4 IP f ailed to r eacquire visual contact with the l ead element,
        likely due to complacency and the belief his SP had them in sight.
        41.2.3. Operator Factor. Number 4 SP failed to inform his IP that he had lost sight of the lead
        element during the latter portion of the rejoin.
     41.3. Lesson Learned. This mishap highlights several crew resource management issues:
        41.3.1. First, if you lose sight as the pilot flying the aircraft, do not rely on the other crewmember
        to ensure flightpath deconfliction. Viable options would be to terminate the maneuver, transfer air-
        craft control to the pilot with the most situa tional awareness, or call “blind” on the radio so other
        formation members are aware and can assume responsibility for deconfliction.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                   67


      41.3.2. Second, it is imperative fo r crewmembers to communicate the complete picture. The SP
      may have assumed the IP had reacquired the visual because he continued the rejoin, while the IP
      may have assumed the SP still had the lead element in sight. The IP could have pressed the SP for
      more information, such as clock position and range, to aid reacquisition. This would have alerted
      the SP that the IP was still blind,and it would have alerted the IP that the SP had lost sight as well.
      41.3.3. Bottom line: When flying dual aircraft, do not make assump tions about the other pilot’ s
      situational awareness.
   41.4. Action Taken:
      41.4.1. Issued specif ic guidance to UPT wings, eliminatin g element rejoins except for immedi-
      ately after takeoff.
      41.4.2. Revised four -ship procedures in the govern ing directive to provide increased emphasis
      and specific guidance on individual aircrew responsibilities during rejoins.

42. Midair Collision—Formation Low Level:
   42.1. Mishap (Figure 42.). The mission was a two-ship, low-leve l, advanced-formation sortie. The
   flight proceeded normally through the low level with Number 2 maintaining an attack formation posi-
   tion (300 to 400 feet aft) on the left side of lead. After passing the target, lead started a climbing right
   turn for return to bas e. The two a ircraft collided as lead rolled out on th e recovery heading and alti-
   tude. Each aircraft did a controll ability check and landed without furt her incident. Both aircraft sus-
   tained major structural damage, but no one was injured.

Figure 42. Midair Collision—Formation Low Level.
68                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     42.2. Investigation:
        42.2.1. Operator Factor. While departing the low level, Number 2 SP was slow to react to lead’    s
        climbing turn and dropped well below and 1,000 to 1,200 feet aft of lead. The SP selected and
        maintained military power to get back into position, but stayed di rectly behind lead and failed to
        perceive the rapidly developing overtake.
        42.2.2. Supervisory Factor. Number 2 IP allowed his SP to close to the forward edge of the cone
        with 50 to 70 knots of closure without taking any action.
        42.2.3. Operator Factor. Number 2 SP abruptly reversed from 60 degrees of right bank to 60
        degrees of left bank when lead ro lled out. The IP assumed control of the aircraft and applied full
        forward stick and left (bottom) rudder to avoid a collision. Howe ver, the aircraft did not respond
        in time.
     42.3. Lesson Learned:
        42.3.1. It is extremely difficult to judge overtake from directly behind another aircraft. There are
        very few line of sight cues to aid in assessing closure. Y will eventually sense line of sight as the
                                                                  ou
        aircraft expands. However, by that time, you may already be too close for comfort. You may occa-
        sionally find yourself trapped at lead’s dead 6 o’clock, but should try to maneuver back to a higher
        aspect as soon as possible. An aspect of 30 degrees works pre tty well. This will place lead’ s
        wingtip on the nose of his aircra ft. It also places you in a po sition where lead can monitor your
        position more easily.
        42.3.2. Lastly, the IP intended to allow the SP to overshoot to gain some experience, but let it go
        so far it exceeded even his ability. An IP must stay cognizant of his or her personal abilities and be
        sure to take the aircraft before the SP can exceed those abilities.
     42.4. Action Taken. Clarified wingman collision avoidance responsibilities in flight training manu-
     als.

43. Midair Collision—Four-Ship Tactical Rejoin:
     43.1. Mishap (Figure 43.). The mishap aircraft were on a routine four-ship training mission. All air-
     craft were dual with three of the students flying their first four-ship mission. The flight proceeded nor-
     mally through the first tw o lead changes. After co mpleting a 90- degree fluid turn, the flight lead
     directed a right turning tactical re join into the mishap element. (Numbers 3 and 4 were in tactical on
     the right side, with Number 4 onNumber 3’s right.) Number 3 IP and Number 4 SP were flying. At the
     beginning of the rejoin, Nu mber 3 started a climb and slight left turn. Numb er 4 stayed on the right,
     but moved forward and closed slightly. Number 3 abruptly reversed his turn to the right as he crossed
     over the lead element’s flightpath and went right into his wingman. Number 4 IP took control of the
     aircraft, flew unloaded, and rolled further left toward Number 3. He then rolled right to match Number
     3’s bank a ngle and increas ed his G loading. Both aircraft collided shortly thereafter. Number 4 SP
     ejected after the coll ision and su stained major injuries . The other three crew members were fatally
     injured, and both aircraft were destroyed upon ground impact.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 69


Figure 43. Midair Collision—Four-Ship Tactical Rejoin.




   43.2. Investigation:
      43.2.1. Supervisory Factor. Number 4 IP did not suf ficiently brief his SP on proper procedures
      and techniques for executing a tactical turning rejoin. The IP failed to provide instruction on how
      to fly the maneuver, although this would be the SP’s first attempt.
      43.2.2. Operator Factor. Number 3 IP failed to monitor his wingman and initiated an abrupt turn
      reversal directly into him.
      43.2.3. Operator Factor. Number 4 IP failed to ensure his SP maintained the proper position for
      the rejoin. He also failed to break out when appropriate, which failed to ensure aircraft separation.
   43.3. Lessons Learned. There were several lessons to be learned from this mishap:
      43.3.1. First, IPs must tail or their instruction to the SPs abilit y and experience le vel, review the
      previous grade sheets, and focus the instructio n on we ak areas or ne w maneuvers. IPs must be
      conscientious and disciplined in this approach.
      43.3.2. Second, a flight lead should monitor the wingman’s position at all times. If lead does not
      have situational awareness on his or her wingman’s position, Lead SHOULD NOT make any sud-
      den turn reversals or abrupt maneuvers.
70                                                                        AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        43.3.3. Third, wingm en are primarily responsible for deconfl iction and shoul d fly in a positi on
        that allows lead to maneuver, as required, without being a hazard to the flight. They should always
        leave themselves an out, assuring nose-tail and/or vertical separation when possible and visualiz-
        ing the actions necessary to take if lead suddenly reverses right into them. For instance, as Number
        4 in the turning rejoin, the wingman should not getcloser than fighting wing until Number 3 is sta-
        bilized in route and moving to fingertip.
     43.4. Action Taken:
        43.4.1. Removed four-ship tactical maneuvering from the UPT syllabus.
        43.4.2. Incorporated a four-ship check ride into the PIT syllabus.

44. Midair Collision—Two-Ship Fighting Wing:
     44.1. Mishap (Figure 44.). The mission was formation training with one dual crew and one solo SP.
     The solo SP led the formation to the military operating area (MOA) and sent his wingman to fighting
     wing. The dual crew maneuvere d from the left side to the right side and into the fighting wing cone
     (30- to 45-degree line), but then pressed forward toward the 3/9 line. As the solo SP began a barrel roll
     to the right, the IP in the win g aircraft realized his aircraft was out of posit ion and directed his SP to
     “go lag.” The IP failed to recognize the developing conflict as the barrel roll continued. The final link
     in the chain was the sun glare that caus ed the dual cr ew to go blind during the last half of the barrel
     roll. The two aircraft collided, and the solo SP was fatally injured. The dual crew ejected successfully
     with minor injuries. Both aircraft were destroyed upon ground impact.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               71


Figure 44. Midair Collision—Two-Ship Fighting Wing.




   44.2. Investigation:
      44.2.1. Supervisory Factor. Due to a lack of experience, the IP did not recognize the developing
      conflict caused by the rapid changes in the lift vector and aspect and the closure resulting from the
      barrel roll.
      44.2.2. Operator and Supervisory Factor. Both the IP and SP in the wing aircraft went blind
      due to sun glare, but neither communicated this situation to the other.
      44.2.3. Operator Factor. The solo SP did not clear his flight path or maintain positional aware-
      ness on his wingman.
   44.3. Lesson Learned:
      44.3.1. The barrel roll is probably the most dynamic maneuver flown with a wingman in the fight-
      ing wing position. The plane of motion, lift vector, aspect, and closure are all changing rapidly. If
      the wingman is close to the aft range limit, it is common practice to fly on the inside of the roll to
      make up some range and get closer to the front limit. However, if the wingman is forward of the
      cone (30 to 45 degrees), this position rapidly leads to a conflict. Lead’s constantly changing plane
      of motion makes it difficult to get to a lag position to manage closure and aspect. Under these con-
      ditions, IPs and SPs should be e xtremely wary and should consider terminating the maneuve r
      early.
72                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        44.3.2. Dual crews must be disciplined with in-flight communication and should avoid ambigu-
        ous statements as much as possible. Crewmembers must be ve ry clear and direct in their com-
        ments and questi ons. For instance, the phrase, “I have it ” can mean several different things—“I
        know what I’m doing,” “I have the aircraft,” “I see the flight lead,” etc. The easiest way to allevi-
        ate the problem is to say what you mean. If you go blind during a maneuver , consider using the
        following example, “I’m blind, do you see lead?” It is concise, but conveys the appropriate infor-
        mation. A good answer is, “Y 2 o-clock, 1,000 feet, slightly high.” An example of poor commu-
                                     es,
        nication is, “Do you have him?” with the answer, “I got it.”
        44.3.3. Although wingmen are responsible for flight deconflicti on, the flight lead is ultimately
        responsible for the safe conduct of the flight. Flight leads should constantly strive to maintain
        positional awareness of thei r wingmen. If the flight lead loses awareness, he or she should avoid
        abrupt maneuvers or sudden re versals and remain predictable, realiz ing that this is not fail-safe.
        Wingmen can and do go “blind,” but they do not alwa call it on the radio. Lead must watch them
                                                               ys
        closely when they are near his or her aircraft and be ready to maneuver if it becomes necessary to
        avoid a collision.
     44.4. Action Taken. Incorporated additional guidance and procedures into flying manuals to provide
     SPs and IPs with the rationale be hind the parameters and desired learning objectives of flying the
     fighting wing formation and exercise. Also included procedures and techniques for maintaining posi-
     tion near the 500-foot limit for separation.

Section E—Landing Mishaps

45. Gear Up Landing:
     45.1. Mishap (Figure 45.). The mission was a solo contact flight. The SP accomplished area w ork
     and returned to the traffic pattern to practice normal patterns. He accomplished three normal patterns,
     but then had to divert when the only usable runway was closed due to a barrier engagement. (Another
     solo student inadvertently lande d noflap.) The SP received clearance from RAPCON and proceeded
     to the alternate base along with two dual T-38s. He arrived with minimum fuel and was given landing
     priority. Approach control vectored the SP to fina l approach, told him to perform his landing check,
     and released him for a VFR landing. He touched down 2,000 feet past the approach end with the land-
     ing gear retracted. The aircraft skidded approximately 4,000 feet before stopping. The SP egressed the
     aircraft without injury.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 73


Figure 45. Gear Up Landing.




   45.2. Investigation:
      45.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The senior RSU controller did not maintain control of traffic during
      an upgrade and allowed an SP to land no flap and engage the barrier, closing the runway.
      45.2.2. Operator Factor. After diverting to the alternate base, the SP failed to lower the landing
      gear or check aircraft configuration before landing.
      45.2.3. Supervisory Factor. The divert plan did not ensure pos itive coordination with the divert
      base or provide adequate supervision of solo aircraft during the landing phase.
   45.3. Lesson Learned:
      45.3.1. This mishap was the consequence of poor checklist discipline on two occasions. The first
      SP failed to acco mplish the befo re-landing checklist and in advertently landed no flap. He was
      unable to stop in the runway remaining and enga ged the barrier, closing the runway. The second
      SP was possibly distracted from having to divert, causing him to break his habit patterns. He also
      failed to perform the before-landing checks and landed gear up.
      45.3.2. Because some checks are simple enough to memo rize, pilots do not always refer to the
      checklist to do them so the checks become habit. The problem with a habit, however, is that it is
      easily disrupted. Be sure to build redundancy into your habit patterns to combat distraction. For
      instance, do the before-landing chec ks at three different locations (at the perch, in the final tur n,
      and rolling out on final) . Although you might get distracted and miss one , you are not likely to
      miss all three.
74                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     45.4. Action Taken. Revised divert procedures to provide adequate supervisory control of solo stu-
     dents during recovery to a divert field.

46. Stall—Final Turn:
     46.1. Mishap (Figure 46.). The mishap was a four-ship formation training flight with the mishap SP
     flying solo. The mission proceeded normally, and the flight returned for landing with the SP as Num-
     ber 4. The pitchout and pattern spacing appeared normal to witnesses. The SP made his geardown call
     entering the final turn and indicated he would full stop. Six seconds later he called, “on the go.” The
     RSU controller noticed the SP wa s approximately 10 degrees nose lo w and transmitted, “In the final
     turn, pull your nose up! Burners! Roll your wings level! ” The aircraft continued to roll left, and the
     nose continued to drop until it impacted the ground. The SP ejected less than 1 second before impact
     and was fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 46. Stall—Final Turn.




     46.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP stalled the aircraft with insuf ficient altitude to
     recover.
     46.3. Lesson Learned. The number one priority during a final turn stall is to properly execute a stall
     recovery. Flying the proper pattern ground track is not a consideration unless a greater hazard exists
     (for example, dual runway operations with another aircraft on final). Ailerons are not as ef fective as
     rudder at high angler of attack (AOA), so the use of rudder should be considered as the primary means
     of rolling wings level. Use caution. It is easy to overcontrol with the rudder because of the high AOA
     and because you get more rudder travel with the gear down.
     46.4. Action Taken:
        46.4.1. Accelerated AOA indicator installation.
        46.4.2. Added following warning to TO IT-38A-l:


                                                 WARNING
         If a high sink rate is allowed to develop, excessive altitude loss will occur and recovery
         may not be possible.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               75


47. Stall—Touch and Go:
   47.1. Mishap (Figure 47.). The aircraft departed as lead airc raft on an initial f ormation training
   flight. Join-up, departure, area maneuvers, and position change were uneventful. The flight progressed
   normally and returned to initial fo r landing, with the mishap air craft as Number 2. The SP made a
   “gear down” call and began a normal final turn. He lined up on final appropriately for the wind condi-
   tions (18 knot crosswind). The SP flared slightly high crossing the runway threshold, and the RSU
   controller directed a go-around. The IP in the RCP acknowledged. The aircraft touched down approx-
   imately 800 feet down the runway , skipped back into the air , and began a slight wing rock. It then
   rolled inverted, contacted the runway , and slid to a stop approximately 338 feet from the point of
   impact. The throttles, which had been in afterburner, were shut off during this sequence. The SP
   received fatal head i njuries, and the IP sustained major head in juries. The aircraft was damaged
   beyond repair.

Figure 47. Stall—Touch and Go.




   47.2. Investigation:
      47.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The IP delayed taking the aircraft, allowing the SP to place the air-
      craft in an unrecoverable position.
      47.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP overcontrolled th e aircraft during the go-around. After allow-
      ing the situation to deteriorate, the IP could not overcome SP’ s control inputs to apply corrective
      actions.
   47.3. Lesson Learned. New IPs commonly ask, “How far is too fa r?” It is impossible to list all the
   possible scenarios where taking aircraft control would be the appropriate action. If the situation feels
   not quite right, even if you are not sure why, it is probably time to take action. Until you build more
   experience, be conservative and take the jet early.
   47.4. Action Taken. Clarified guidance in training manuals c oncerning transfer of aircraft control,
   especially during critical phases of flight.
76                                                                    AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


48. Gear Extension Failure:
     48.1. Mishap (Figure 48.). The mission was an FCF for an engi ne change and work on the flight
     control rigging. The sortie proceed ed normally until the alternate landing gear extension check. The
     right main landing gear indicated unsafe. The unsafe indication persiste d after the pilot lowered the
     landing gear with the n ormal system. A chas e ship visually confirmed the right main gear was 10
     degrees shy of full extension and the side brace linkage had not reached the over-center position. The
     pilot made numerous attempts to lower the gear to include applying G forces, yawing the aircraft, and
                                                     ,
     shutting down the left engine to deplete hydraulic pressure. All were unsuccessful. In all, he made 17
     attempts to lower the gear. As the fuel approached about 350 pounds, the crew entered the designated
     controlled bailout area and ejected successfully. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 48. Gear Extension Failure.




     48.2. Investigation (Maintenance Factor). Maintenance technicians performed unscheduled main-
     tenance on the landing gear, but did not comply with published TOs. Further, the technicians did not
     document their work in the aircraft forms or indicate what remained to be done. As a result, mainte-
     nance had not performed the operati nal landing gear extension and retraction check required by TOs.
                                         o
     48.3. Lesson Learned. This is a common lesson. Failure to follow applicable TO guidance and doc-
     ument aircraft discrepancies in the AFTO IMT 781 aircraft maintenance log can lead to a mishap. This
     is not just for maintenance; it applies equally to aircrews.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                77


   48.4. Action Taken:
      48.4.1. Revised maintenance technical data to clarify those maintenance actions requiring subse-
      quent gear retraction tests.
      48.4.2. Placed emphasis on the impor tance of aircraft maintenance documentation and TO com-
      pliance.

49. Stall—Final Turn:
   49.1. Mishap (Figure 49.). The mishap aircraft was Number 2 in a two-ship formation. Number 2
   was a solo SP. The flight had returned early due to a minor aircraft malfunction. The flight entered ini-
   tial and pitched out. As the lead aircraft rolled out on final, the crew observed the wingman had insuf-
   ficient spacing so lead initiated a go-around to allow the wingman to land. However , the RSU
   controller directed Number 2 to go a round because he was halfway through the final turn. Shortly
   thereafter, the RSU controller observed Number 2 aircraft in an excessive bank and nose-low attitude
   and directed, “burners and pull it up.” As the ai rcraft continued to de scend, the RSU controller
   directed afterburner again. The airc raft recovered to a ne ar level attitude, but impacted short of the
   runway in a shallow right bank with very little sink rate. Although the SP survived the impact, he later
   succumbed to burn injuries. The aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 49. Stall—Final Turn.




   49.2. Investigation:
      49.2.1. Operator Factor. The solo SP flew a tight er pattern than lead and inadvertently estab-
      lished a cutoff angle on lead in the final turn. The SP w as most likely distracted by his aircraft’ s
78                                                                        AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        malfunction and failed to clear for his flight lead. The SP began an evasive maneuver when he
        finally recognized the conflict, but did not advance the power, thus developing a high sink rate.
        49.2.2. Supervisory Factor. Although there were only two aircra ft in the pattern, the RSU con-
        troller did not sufficiently monitor their activities and failed to anti cipate the conflict until it wa s
        too late.
     49.3. Lesson Learned:
        49.3.1. Wingmen are responsible for many things, notably ensuring flight deconfliction. Their job
        becomes much more difficult when faced with an aircraft malfunction, even a minor one.
        49.3.2. Situation awareness begins to shrink as malfunctions draw your fo cus inside the cockpit
        versus outside the a ircraft. Flights should consider transferring the ta sk load by pl acing the bad
        aircraft in the lead when conditions permit. If that is not practical, attempt to land the bad aircraft
        first as a minimum.
        49.3.3. Even if it does not make sense for the bad aircraft to lead back, there are still several rea-
        sons to land the bad aircraft first. If the good aircraft lands first, it could blow a tire or have some
        other problem, causing it to close the runway. Also, the bad aircraft would have to manage its mal-
        function, monitor the good aircraft ’s pattern spacing and position to get appropriate spacing for
        landing, and possibly contend with wake turbulence in the flare.
     49.4. Action Taken:
        49.4.1. Clarified instructions fo r pattern breakouts and go-arounds in the governing directives.
        Increased emphasis on breaking out of the pattern when losing sight of the proceeding aircraft.
        49.4.2. Increased the fire resistance of aircrew flight cl othing (gloves, flight jackets, underwear,
        and G-suits).

50. Final Approach Crash—Traffic Conflict:
     50.1. Mishap (Figure 50.). This mishap occurred because of a traffic pattern conflict between two
     T-38s during final approach and la nding. Both aircraft were SP solos. The mishap aircraft was Num-
     ber 2 in a four-ship formation and had rolled out on final from an overhead pattern when another air-
     craft passed it on an emer gency straight-in appr oach. The emer gency aircraft continued to an
     uneventful landing. The mishap aircraft attempted a go-around, but apparently encountered wake tur-
     bulence and impacted the runway overrun. Although the aircraft was destroyed, the SP egressed with
     only minor injuries.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               79


Figure 50. Final Approach Crash—Traffic Conflict.




   50.2. Investigation:
      50.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The RSU controller did not take positive action to prevent a danger-
      ous conflict between aircraft in the traffic pattern. Although the straight-in aircraft made an inac-
      curate position report that detracte d slightly from the controller ’s situational awareness, the RSU
      still had sufficient visual cues to see the conflict developing.
      50.2.2. Operator Factor. The mishap SP failed to clear properly.
   50.3. Lesson Learned. Quite often an investigation reveals that several failures, human or mechani-
   cal, interact to create a mishap. Eliminating one act ion or inaction can make the dif ference. In this
   case, the RSU controller failed to maintain positive control of the pattern, and both SPs made errors in
   judgment. Bottom line: Do not make assumptions about another pilot or controller ’s situational
   awareness because that leads to complacency.
   50.4. Action Taken:
      50.4.1. Changed operating procedures to require 9-mile a nd 4-mile position reports during a
      straight-in approach.
      50.4.2. Established local procedures to alert appr opriate agencies (approach control, SOF, RSU,
      control tower, etc.) of an emergency aircraft in time to plan for its recovery.
80                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


51. Instrument Approach:
     51.1. Mishap (Figure 51.). This mishap occurred during the final approach of a formation instru-
     ment approach. The mission was a post-PIT familiarization mission. During a shallow turn just past
     the final approach fix (F AF) at approximately 365 feet AGL, the wingman ap peared to go high and
     break away from the leader with 60 to 80 degrees of bank. The roll continued for 450 degrees, and the
     aircraft impacted the ground in nearly 90 degrees of left bank and slightly nose high. Both pilots were
     fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 51. Instrument Approach.




     51.2. Investigation (Factors Unknown). The mishap cause was unknown, but the following equally
     likely possibilities were considered: a flight control malfunction, flight control interference, or incor-
     rect pilot inputs. The maneuver was precipitated by a rudder input, but the source of the input could
     not be determined.
     51.3. Lesson Learned. The cause of this mishap was undetermined. However, aircrews should exer-
     cise caution when countering rudde r system malfunctions while conf igured and at lo w altitude and
     airspeed. They should also avoid abrupt control inputs and fight the tendency to overcontrol.
     51.4. Action Taken. Expanded the governing directive procedures for formation breakouts to include
     specific situations where both aircraft are maneuvering at or near approach speeds with gear and full
     flaps.

52. Stall—Final Turn:
     52.1. Mishap (Figure 52.). The SP completed a normal takeof f and departure for a contact mission.
     He reported an 8-mile initial approximately 35 minutes later. He pitched out and configured normally,
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                  81


   made his geardown call, a nd began the final turn. He initially rolled to 30 to 35 degrees of bank, but
   slowly increased the bank to appr oximately 60 degrees. The aircraft pitched down to an extremely
   nose low attitude, and the ai rcraft continued rolling through inverted back to nearly wings level. The
   aircraft nose came up slightly but the aircraft continued its rapid rate of descent. The aircraft impacted
                                  ,
   the ground 30 degrees nose low and with 8 degrees of left bank. The SP was fatally injured, and the
   aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 52. Stall—Final Turn.




   52.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP stalled the aircraft in the final turn and was unable to
   recover. Maintenance investigation determined the aircraft was functioning properly.
   52.3. Lesson Learned:
      52.3.1. This is another grim reminder that stalls in the final turn can kill you. If the traffic pattern
      does not look good, go around and try again. Y ou do not have much altitude or time available to
      correct a poorly flown traf fic pattern. You must detect and correct deviations, such as slow air-
      speed, excessive bank, and high sink rates, as early as possible. Do not hesitate to execute the stall
      recovery procedures if it does not look or feel right.
      52.3.2. In the event of an actual stall, execut e the recovery immediatel y. In this mishap, it is
      highly possible the SP allowed his ai rspeed to decrease below final turn airspeed prior to leaving
82                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        the perch. Instead of increasing airspeed and/or breaking out, he began his final turn and immedi-
        ately stalled.
     52.4. Action Taken:
        52.4.1. Expanded discussi on in the governing dir ective on flight control effectiveness, particu-
        larly the rudder. Cautioned pilots on possible vi olent aircraft reactions when overcontrolling the
        rudder during stalls and slow-flight maneuvering.
        52.4.2. Directed minimum airspeed on downwind to be no less than computed final turn airspeed.

53. Short Landing—Wind Shear:
     53.1. Mishap (Figure 53.). This mishap occurred during landing at a cross-country airfield. The mis-
     hap aircraft was lead of a two- ship formation, which had split to perform indivi dual instrument
     approaches. The mishap aircraft was directed to go around from its first approach because another air-
     craft was on the runway . Lead flew a closed pattern rather than another radar pattern due to rapidly
     approaching bad weather. The aircraft encountered a severe wind shear on final assoc iated with the
     storm. The IP was unable to compensate; and the ai rcraft impacted short of the runway , sheared the
     gear, and skidded approximately 1,600 feet. The aircraft came to rest 700 feet left of the runway. Nei-
     ther crewmember was injured.

Figure 53. Short Landing—Wind Shear.




     53.2. Investigation:
        53.2.1. Operator Factor. The pilot wa s advised of vi olent weather 3 miles west of his destina-
        tion, but underestimated the potential impact on his recovery.
        53.2.2. Environmental Factor. The aircraft was struck by t he strong first-gust winds (a 45- t o
        65-knot tailwind) associated with a thunderstorm.
     53.3. Lesson Learned. Crewmembers were concer ned about weather conditio ns at the destination
     airport and updated their weather information en route. They received an advisory of violent weather
     in close proximity to the destination airport, but chose to continue on to the destination. The prudent
     decision would have b een to divert to the alternate. The crew should not have taken chances with
     severe weather. Also, approach control and tower personnel knew of the storm’s position and severity
     and expressed their concern over the phone, but did not relay appropriate details to the pilot.
     53.4. Action Taken. Modified the Inst rument Refresher Co urse (IRC) to in clude information on
     gusts, wind shear, and other hazards associated with thunderstorms.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              83


54. Gear Extension Failure:
   54.1. Mishap (Figure 54.). The mishap occurred at the conclusi on of a two-ship formation training
   mission. The formation split for individual overhead approaches for full stop landings after a precision
   wing approach. A solo SP flew the mishap aircraft. In the final turn, the SP noticed that the right main
   landing gear indicated unsafe. A chase aircraft and the RSU co nfirmed the gear was partially
   extended. All attempts to fully extend the right main gear were unsuccessful, including shutting down
   the left engine and depleting utility hydraulic system pressure. The right engine flamed out from fuel
   starvation en route to th e controlled bailout area. The SP ejected su ccessfully, but the aircraft was
   destroyed.

Figure 54. Gear Extension Failure.




   54.2. Investigation (Material Factor). The side brace trunnion of the right main landing gear failed
   due to fatigue, preventing the right main landing gear from extending fully.
   54.3. Lesson Learned:
      54.3.1. The SP needlessly placed himself and ci vilians on the ground at risk during the latter
      stages of the mishap. He failed to plan for the ejection and ran out of gas before completing the
      before-ejection checklist and before reaching the designated bailout area.
      54.3.2. Set a bingo fuel when work ing a malfunction, just like you set a bingo in the area. Once
      you reach bingo, transition to the next stage. In this case, the SOF or operations supervisors could
      have helped out by calculating the fuel required to reach the bailout area.
84                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     54.4. Action Taken:
        54.4.1. Established an inspection requirement to provide a more detailed ultrasonic inspection to
        identify cracks in the casting of the side brace trunnion.
        54.4.2. Revised SOF guidance to include the following statement:


         Attempts to correct airborne emergencies that could result in aircrew ejection or bailout if
         not corrected should be terminat ed with sufficient time or fuel remaining to per mit the
         disabled aircraft to reach the designated bailout area.

55. Premature Gear Retraction—Touch and Go:
     55.1. Mishap (Figure 55.). The flight was briefed as a pattern-only mission. A senior class SP occu-
     pied the FCP as the aircr aft commander, and a junior class SP occupied the RCP as a dynamic
     observer. After completing three circuits around the pattern to burn down fuel, the FCP SP flew two
     successful touch-and-go landings. The aircraft to uched down slightly hard and fast on the third
     touch-and-go. As the air craft passed the RSU, th e RSU crew observed the landing gear doors were
     open, indicating the gear were in retraction. The aircraft settled to the runway and drifted to the right.
     It departed the runway approximately 1,200 feet from touchdown with the gear retracted and traveled
     another 2,300 feet before stopping. The RCP SP ejected shortly after the aircraft departed the runway,
     and the FCP SP egressed after the aircraft stopped. Neither crewmember was injured.

     55.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The FCP SP had been directed to give no instruction to the
     back seat observer, but he di d not follow those direc tions. Instead, he be came preoccupied with
     explaining his approach, which de tracted from basic aircraft cont rol. Unhappy and possibly embar-
     rassed with the fast and slightly hard landing, he hastily executed touch-and-go procedures, raising the
     landing gear handle prior to becoming airborne.
     55.3. Lesson Learned:
        55.3.1. The FCP SP failed to follow the three basic priorities: aviate first, navigate next, and com-
        municate last. Even IPs prioritize incorrectly on occasion, letting instruction take precedence over
        flying the aircraft. Just remember to aviate, navigate, and communicate in that order.
        55.3.2. In addition, th e SP let his emotions get the best of him and deviated from his habit pat-
        terns, raising the gear early . There is little room for error w hen flying high performance aircraft.
        Stay focused!
     55.4. Action Taken. Reevaluated the dynamic observer program.

56. Final Approach Crash—Wake Turbulence:
     56.1. Mishap (Figure 56.). The mission was an instrument navigation check ride for the student. The
     aircraft crashed while going around on a tactical air navigation (TACAN) final. Approach control had
     asked the aircrew to slow to final approach speed during the penetration because they were following
     a LOGAR L-382 (a civilian stretch C-130). The aircrew was also followed by a T-39 carrying a code
     06 (very important person) and ha d discussed keeping their speed up on final to accommodate the
     T-39. The aircrew reported the F AF to the tower , who told them the L-382 was on short final. The
     tower then instructed them to go around due to in sufficient spacing. (The L-382 was 1 1/2 to 2 miles
     in front, and the T-39 was 4 miles behind.) Just after the aircrew acknowledged the go-around instruc-
     tions, the aircraft abruptly rolled left to 60 to 90 degrees bank, slightly nose low. It flew through sev-
     eral small trees 2 1/ 2 miles north of the runway approach e nd, struck a curb, became airborne again,
     and finally crashed into a brick home. The home was unoccupied at the time. Both crewmembers were
     fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               87


Figure 56. Final Approach Crash—Wake Turbulence.




   56.2. Investigation (Supervision Factor). The aircrew and air traf fic controller had not been given
   sufficient information or guidance concerning the severity of “heavy” aircraft wake turbulence.
   56.3. Lesson Learned. The T-38 is highly susceptible to wake turbulence. Air traffic controllers are
   not always aware of the spacing requirements. Therefore, the pilot is ultimately responsible for ensur-
   ing adequate separation to avoi d jet wash. As a minimum, the pilot s hould stay 1 nm behind a
   fighter-size aircraft, 2 minutes be hind a large aircraft (equating to roughly 5 to 8 nm), and 4 minutes
   behind a “heavy” aircraft (10 to 16 nm).
   56.4. Action Taken:
      56.4.1. Incorporated additional guidance concerning spacing requirements between dissimilar air-
      craft in Air Force and command flight directives.
      56.4.2. Added the following warning to the TO IT-38A-l:


                                            WARNING
       The T-38, because of its short wingspan, is particularly susceptible to wake turbulence
       upset. The vortex-produced rolling moment can exceed the aileron authority of the
       T-38 in la nding configuration. The rapid ch anges in lift can resu lt in a stall without
       sufficient altitude to recover.

57. Instrument Approach:
   57.1. Mishap (Figure 57.). The flight was the return leg of a solo day/night, out-and-back navigation
   mission. The night mis sion was planne d with an en route descent and radar vector to an instrument
88                                                                        AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     landing system (ILS) approac h at the home station. The flight pr ogressed normally until air traf fic
     control directed the pilot to cha nge radio frequencies fr om arrival control to the final approach con-
     troller. Radio contact was lost for approximately 2 minutes and 6 seconds. Arrival control finally rees-
     tablished radio contact on their frequency , and th ey told the SP to remain on the ir frequency to
     complete the approach. In accordance with local procedures, RAPCON terminated radar service when
     the aircraft was on 2 -mile final. However, the RSU was unaware of the airc raft’s exact position and
     did not realize it was in the unit’s sphere of responsibility. The aircraft began a rapid descent after tran-
     sitioning from ILS to VASI glidepath guidance and impacted the trees short of the runway. The stu-
     dent was fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 57. Instrument Approach.




     57.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP did not attach his zero delay lanyard, set his final
     approach speed index improperly, was not wearing flight gloves, and had consumed portions of a box
     lunch in flight. He also remained off frequency for more than 2 minutes on final approa ch. For an
     unknown reason, he descended below th e normal final approach glidep ath, impacting the trees short
     of the landing runway.
     57.3. Lesson Learned:
         57.3.1. It is possible the SP suffered some sort of visual illusion or spatial disorientation on short
         final. He was obviously behind th e aircraft, as indicated by his zero delay lanyard being discon-
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                             89


      nected and improper airspeed index. He also exhibited poor flight discipline and misprioritization
      by not wearing his gloves and eating in flight during a night sortie.
      57.3.2. The SP was obviously not focused on the task at hand, which made him even more suscep-
      tible to nighttime spatial disorientation. Bottom line: Night missions may seem somewhat benign
      compared to daytime contact or formation missions, but they require just as much focus, if not
      more. Pilots rely heavily on vision to maintain at titude awareness, and many of those visual cues
      just are not there at night. They must be disciplined with the cross-check.
   57.4. Action Taken:
      57.4.1. Expanded instrument procedures training to include night lighting systems and procedures
      for transitioning from precision approaches to visual final.
      57.4.2. Stressed aircrew discipline to all command aircrews.

58. Runway Departure—Brake Malfunction:
   58.1. Mishap (Figure 58.). The flight was the fir st sortie of a solo student out-and-back navigation
   mission. The SP lost aircraft control while braki g during a landing at the non-Air Force out base. The
                                                     n
   left main landing gear de parted the left s ide of the ru nway and struck an exposed concrete lighting
   pad, destroying the left main gear and substantially damaging the le ft wing and horizontal stabilizer.
   The aircraft came to rest on a taxiway at the departure end of the runway, and the SP egressed without
   injury.

     58.2. Investigation:
        58.2.1. Maintenance Factor. Maintenance personnel had not pr operly corrected a previously
        identified defective brake. The defect created a differential braking action, causing the aircraft to
        drift left as the SP applied the brakes.
        58.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP failed to use th e remaining brake, rudder, and/or nosewheel
        steering to remain on the runway.
     58.3. Lesson Learned. Although the flight manual did not speci fically include guidance for direc-
     tional control problems on landing, pilots were expected to use good judgment and common sense. In
     this case, the SP allowed the aircraft to drift versus using all available means to remain on the runway.
     58.4. Action Taken. Incorporated guidance for landing with a bl wn tire, locked brake, or directional
                                                                     o
     control difficulty into TO IT-38A-l and added the following warning:


                                                  WARNING
         If one brake system fails or failure is suspected, plan to land in the center of the runway.
         Stop the aircraft by using aerodynamic braking followed by a combination of wheel brake
         and nosewheel s teering. Rudder pedals should be neutralized prior to engaging the
         nosewheel steering to prevent violent swerving and possible loss of directional control.

59. Circling Approach:
     59.1. Mishap (Figure 59.). The mission was a day dual out-and-back navigation training sortie. The
     SP needed a circling approach to complete syllabus training requirements. The flight proceeded nor-
     mally until the approach at the destination base. The crew requested a TACAN to circle for an oppo-
     site direction low approach, fo llowed by radar vectors to initial . The SP flew the T ACAN final
     approach to the north and then circled to the east. The aircraft cras hed in the final turn, impacting an
     open field approximately 1 1/4 mile s from the runway approach end and 350 feet right (west) of the
     runway extended centerline. The aircraft slid anot her 650 feet after impact and struck a residential
     home. Neither crew member attempted to eject, and both were fa tally injured. The aircraft was
     destroyed upon impact.

Figure 59. Circling Approach.




   59.2. Investigation:
      59.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The IP had never flow n a circling ap proach in the T-38 as a rated
      crewmember. Circling approaches were not a required maneuver during local upgrade training or
      on standardization evaluations.
      59.2.2. Operator Factor. The aircrew used inad equate downwind displacement, exceeded bank
      angle limits, and descended below the circling minimum descent altitude (MDA) with a high sink
      rate, which neither recognized.
   59.3. Lesson Learned. Pilots are ultimately responsible for their own training and should never fly a
   new maneuver without doing their homework. The mishap IP may have assumed a circling maneuver
   was just like a normal overhead, but there are some important differences. Pilots must take time dur-
   ing mission preparation to identify unfamiliar areas and do the appropriate study.
   59.4. Action Taken:
      59.4.1. Revised governing directives to expand circling approach guidance.
      59.4.2. Established requirement for all T and T-37 aircrews going through PIT or local upgrade
                                                 -38
      training to display proficiency in circling approaches.

60. Circling Approach:
   60.1. Mishap (Figure 60.). The flight was th e first sortie of a dual student overnight cross-country
   training mission. The SP executed a high altitude penetration, IL S low approach, mi ssed approach,
   and practice no-gyro ASR approach at the first cross-country base. The IP (in the RCP) assumed con-
   trol of the aircraft to demonstrate a circling approach to a full-stop landing. The IP rolled out on a half
   to three-quarter mile final at 600 to 800 feet AGL. He was steep wi th a higher-than-normal rate of
92                                                                        AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


     descent. He pulled back on the stick and added power just before touchdown in an effort to reduce the
     rate of descent and extend the touchdown point. It was not enough, however , and the nose gear and
     right main gear failed upon runway contact. The left main gear re mained extended, and the aircraft
     skidded approximately 1,500 feet on the left gear, nose section, and right wingtip before departing the
     left side of the runway . The airc raft skidded an additional 400 fe et after departing the runway . Both
     crewmembers egressed without injury, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage.

Figure 60. Circling Approach.




     60.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The IP flew a poor circling appr oach, resulting in an exces-
     sively steep final. He failed to recognize the a pproach was unsafe and landed with an extremely high
     rate of descent.
     60.3. Lesson Learned. The IP was young, inexperienced, and on his first student cross country. He
     allowed his emotions to get the be st of him in an unsure situati on instead using of good judgment to
     dictate his actions. In an effort to save face in front of an SP, he failed to properly assess the danger or
     initiate a go-around. IPs need to se t the standard for good judgment, as well as good flying skills. As
     the old saying goes, a superior pilot is one who “use his superior judgment to keep from having to use
                                                             s
     his superior skills.”
     60.4. Action Taken. Expanded governing direc tives to provide additio nal guidance on circling
     approaches.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                93


61. Instrument Approach:
   61.1. Mishap (Figure 61.). The mishap aircraft was on an instr ument proficiency flight for two IPs
   with approaches at an en route field. Air traffic control cleared the crew for a TACAN penetration and
   approach at the initial approach fix. Weather was VMC with 7 miles visibility. The RCP pilot flew the
   penetration and was 2,000 f eet high at the F AF. He initiated a st eep descent to get to the MDA, but
   overshot the level off and descended rapidly through the MDA about 2 miles from the approach end.
   The FCP pilot took control of the aircraft and se lected maximum afterburner on both engines. How-
   ever, the aircraft continued its descent and touched down 500 feet s hort and 1,400 feet to the right of
   the runway. The aircraft skidded for approximately 1,500 feet, struck a large area of vegetation and a
   flood control ditch, and finally came to rest. The aircraft was e ngulfed in flames. The RCP pilot
   egressed without assistance, but firefighters had to extract the FCP pilot, who was unconscious. Both
   pilots received major injuries, and the aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 61. Instrument Approach.




   61.2. Investigation:
      61.2.1. Operator Factor. The RCP pilot flew a T  ACAN penetration and was 2,000 feet above the
      minimum FAF altitude. He flew an excessively steep final to get down to the MDA by the missed
      approach point, but did not use enough power at level off to stop the high sink rate and descended
      below the MDA.
      61.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The FCP pilot was probably complacent and delayed correcting the
      RCP pilot’s errors. The RCP pilot was his flight commander and was a highly qualified IP.
   61.3. Lessons Learned. There are two major lessons here:
      61.3.1. Complacency can kill you. It takes great efort to fight complacency because it can be very
                                                            f
      insidious. If you ever fee l relaxed in the aircraft, take a hard look at what is going on—you are
      probably missing something. Most pilots experience their firs t mishap or incident around 500
      hours, which is when they start to get comfortable in the aircraft.
      61.3.2. A high sink rate on final can be even more deadly than a stall. A stall is more easily iden-
      tifiable than a sink rate due to increased buffet level and aircraft feel at high AOA. Be sure to bring
94                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        the vertical velocity indicator (VVI) into your cross-check becaus e it may be the only reliable
        means of gauging your sink rate. Do not rely on ground rush because it is already too late by then.
        Depending on the aircraft’s gross weight, temperature, and pressure altitude, consider executing a
        stall recovery any time you see a VVI greater than 3,500 to 4,000 feet per minute in the traffic pat-
        tern.
     61.4. Action Taken. None.

62. Runway Departure—Crosswind:
     62.1. Mishap (Figure 62.). The mission was an accelerated copilo t enrichment (ACE) team sortie.
     The flight was uneventful until the crew returned to base for an overhead pattern for a full-stop land-
     ing. The crosswind component at the time of landing was 12 to 23 knots from the right. The aircraft
     touched down about 500 feet down the runway in the center. It shortly became airborne again, in left
     bank. As it departed the left side of the runway, the left wing struck a 3-foot-high snow fence that was
     150 feet from the runway edge. The aircraft bank increased to 50 degrees, and the left wing struck the
     ground. The aircraft rolled back to the right, and all three landing gear impacted the ground. The RCP
     pilot ejected successfully. The airc raft continued forward on the ground, crashed through another
     snow fence, crossed a closed runway, and became airborne once more at the edge of a bluff. The FCP
     pilot ejected as the aircraft became airborne. Alt hough the seat separated from the aircraft, the pilot
     did not get a full parachute before landing and was fatally injured upon impact. The aircraft continued
     another 836 feet before impacting an unprepared field 45 feet below the top of the bluff.

Figure 62. Runway Departure—Crosswind.




     62.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). Both pilots failed to adequately plan for the gusty cross-
     winds. The RCP pilot indicated they had computed the correct airspeed to include a gust factor, but the
     airspeed reference markers were both set at the basicapproach airspeed. The mishap pilot failed to use
     prescribed crosswind landing procedures. (Proper procedures are to crab for landing, land on the
     upwind side, and perform no aerobrake.) He landed w   ithout a crab in the center of the runway and per-
     formed a normal aerobrake, causing the aircraft to drift and become airborne. The pilot overcontrolled
     during the go-around and inadvertently stalled the aircraft.
     62.3. Lesson Learned. Know and follow TO procedures. Flying is a dangerous business and requires
     a disciplined approach to do it safely.
     62.4. Action Taken. The ACE program was thoroughly reviewed for adequacy, standardization, and
     safety.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                  95


63. Stall—Final Turn:
   63.1. Mishap (Figure 63.). The SP wa s on his se cond solo contact sortie. Departure and area work
   were uneventful. The SP was on hi s third traffic pattern when he overshot final. The RSU controller
   advised the SP that there was no conflict with tr affic on the center parallel runway. The SP acknowl-
   edged and indicated he was going around. He increased his bank to about 60 de grees and ina dvert-
   ently developed a high sink rate. Th e RSU contro ller noted the descent and told the SP to us e his
   afterburners. Just moments later, the aircraft impacted the ground and was totally destroyed. The stu-
   dent made no attempt to eject and was fatally injured.

Figure 63. Stall—Final Turn.




   63.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP configured the aircraft with landing gear, but failed
   to lower the flaps. He initiated his turn to final, using normal full-flap airspeeds. As he increased bank
   during the ensuing overshoot, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The RSU controller directed the
   student to use afterburners, but the student had insufficient altitude to recover.
   63.3. Lesson Learned:
      63.3.1. The SP probably failed to lowe r his flaps due to in attention and/or distraction. Habit pat-
      terns are fragile things, so plan for disruption or di traction. That is, develop habit patterns that can
                                                            s
      withstand interruption. The gear check has been mentioned before. Check its configuration at the
      perch, in the final turn, and rolling out on final. It is unlikely you will miss all three.
96                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


        63.3.2. In addition, the SP concentr ated on flying the correct pattern ground track at the expense
        of aircraft control. The basic priorities still apply when executing a stall recovery—aviate, navi-
        gate, and then communicate. Concentrate on missing the ground instead of navigating the ground
        track!
     63.4. Action Taken. Stressed the importance of AOA in determining the proper aircraft configura-
     tion and performance to all T-38 aircrews.

64. Circling Approach:
     64.1. Mishap (Figure 64.). The mission was a dual contact sortie with touch-and-go landings at an
     alternate base. The SP became co nfused by tower instruc tions on TACAN final and starte d a
     go-around at about 90 feet AGL. The IP took control and tried to salvage the approach. He got into a
     high sink rate, and the aircraft landed hard about 130 feet past the runway threshold. The aircraft sus-
     tained substantial damage from the impact and came to rest approximately 3,000 feet from the thresh-
     old and 160 feet right of the runway. The crew egressed after the aircraft came to a stop. The IP
     sustained major back injuries, but the student was uninjured.

Figure 64. Circling Approach.




     64.2. Investigation (Supervisory Factor). The IP assumed aircraft control in the overrun to salvage
     the approach. He lowered the nose to establish a visual glidepath a nd developed an excessive rate of
     descent. He did not recognize the developing hazard and continued the approach to impact.
     64.3. Lesson Learned. Go-around and missed approach procedures are established and practiced for
     a reason—not every landing is salvag eable. If it does not look right, take it around. IPs, let your SPs
     make decisions, even if they are more conservative than you would be. Be sure to debrief it, but avoid
     second-guessing them in the air unless safety is an issue. Conservative decisions will rarely get you
     into trouble, but second-guessing and indecision will get you nearly every time.
     64.4. Action Taken. None.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                               97


65. Pitot Static System Failure and Gear Failure:
   65.1. Mishap (Figure 65.). The mission was a single-ship accel erated copilot enrichment program
   instrument training sortie. The aircrew flew five instrument approaches including three touch-and-go
   landings. On the sixth approach, the aircrew felt extreme airframe buffet when they lowered the land-
   ing gear. The master caution light and left hydraulic pressure light illuminated. The left hydraulic
   pressure read between 100 and 200 pounds per square inch (psi), and the cockpit gear indicators
   showed the nose gear as safe a nd both main gear as unsafe. In ad dition, the aircrew noticed the air-
   speed indicators dropping to zero. They went missed approach with afterburner and accomplished the
   hydraulic failure emergency procedures checklist. The ai rcrew used the mirrors to look at the main
   gear and both appeared down. They flew an instrument approach to land, using the AOA as the pri-
   mary airspeed reference. On touchdown, the aircrew felt as if the right ma in gear would not support
   the aircraft and executed a missed approach. They were now low on fuel so they proceeded to the con-
   trolled bailout area . (The hydr aulic failure prevented a gearup la nding.) Both crewmembers ejected
   successfully and were uninjured, but the aircraft was destroyed upon impact.

Figure 65. Pitot Static System Failure and Gear Failure.




   65.2. Investigation:
      65.2.1. Logistics Factor. Stress corrosion cracking developed in the area of the eyebolt attach
      point and forward door attach point of the outer cylinder of the right main landing gear strut. Tech-
      nical data was inadequate and did not require a periodic T-38 main landing gear strut NDI.
      65.2.2. Logistics Factor:
          65.2.2.1. The pitot heat failed during flight because of circuit discontinuity, which was proba-
          bly due to carbon deposits on the contacts in the pitot heat swit ch. As a result, the pitot tube
          accumulated ice, causing and airspeed indicator system malfunction.
98                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


            65.2.2.2. The crew most likely lowered the gear in excess of 240 KIAS due to erroneous air-
            speed indications, overstressing the right main gear eyebolt attachment point. As a result of the
            excessive aerodynamic loads and the stress-corrosion cracking, the outer cylinder of the right
            main gear strut failed catastrophically.
            65.2.2.3. The left hydraulic sy stem most likely developed a leak at a break in the line to the
            gear-actuating cylinder, depleting the system and preventing gear retr action. The right main
            gear would not support the weight of the aircraft for landing, so the crew made a good decision
            to go-around.
     65.3. Lesson Learned. Compound emergencies can be confusing and made even more so by their
     infrequent nature. Be sure to thoroughly ana lyze your indications before jumping to conclusions. If
     you cannot determine everything that is wrong with your aircraft, be conservative and plan for the
     worst case.
     65.4. Action Taken. Developed periodic nondestructive inspections for main landing gear struts.

66. Stall—Final Turn:
     66.1. Mishap (Figure 66.). The mishap aircraft was on a solo two-ship training mission. Departure
     and area work were uneventful, and the flight was back in the pattern for landing. The SP pitched out
     normally and called, “gear down , full stop.” The aircraft imp acted the ground approximately
     three-quarters through the final turn. The SP did not eject and was fatally injured.

Figure 66. Stall—Final Turn.




     66.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP appro ached a stall o r developed a sink rate shortly
     after beginning the final turn. He failed to recogni ze the impending stall or sink and did not initiate a
     stall recovery. He may have been s low to react due to fatigue. The investigation revealed a lack of
     sleep and high activity in the 3 days prior to the mishap, compounded by hot weather.
     66.3. Lessons Learned. There are two main lessons learned:
        66.3.1. Each of us has limits. Know what yours are and do not push them. If you do not feel up to
        a mission, cancel and do it another day.
        66.3.2. It is more effective to avoid a stall than to recover from one. However, it is harder to rec-
        ognize an impending stall th an a fully developed one. Ke ep the AOA and VVI in your
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 99


      cross-check. Consider executing a stall recovery anytime you see greater than 0.8 AOA or 4,000
      feet per minute in the traffic pattern.
   66.4. Action Taken. Added guidance on the effects of fatigue, stress, and improper nutrition.

67. Stall—Final Turn:
   67.1. Mishap (Figure 67.). The mishap aircraft was lead in a two-ship formation sortie. The mission
   was uneventful until returning to the traffic pattern. The aircraft impacted the ground during the final
   turn and was destroyed. Both crewmembers were fatally injured.

Figure 67. Stall—Final Turn.




   67.2. Investigation:
      67.2.1. Operator Factor. The SP performed the pitchout and angled about 10 to 20 degrees into
      the runway, flying to an extremel y tight inside downwind position. It is possible he mistook the
      center runway for the landing runway. At any rate, he was too close to fly a normal final turn and
      used excessive bank and back stick pressure to pr event an overshoot. He fa iled to recognize the
      hazards associated with a high si nk rate and impending stall and continued the turn until the IP
      took the aircraft.
      67.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The IP was likely complacent or not paying attent ion and allowed
      the SP to begin the final turn. (The SP had over 4,000 flight hours.) The IP failed to recognize the
      excessive sink rate and impending stall until it was too late. When the IP finally took control of the
      aircraft, he executed a go-around instead of a traf fic pattern stall recovery. The aircraft entered a
      full stall with insufficient altitude to recover. Both pilots ejected out of the safe ejection envelope
      and were fatally injured.
100                                                                      AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


      67.3. Lesson Learned:
         67.3.1. The SP was tight to the landing runway so he used excessive bank and back stick to make
         the turn. He would also have had to fly a steeper turn to lose the altitude in the shorter distance to
         the runway. Under these conditions, it is actually possible to fly the final turn at the correct final
         turn airspeed and AOA, masking the danger. The only indication of a problem would be the VVI,
         which would be much higher than normal.
         67.3.2. Most pilots experience ground rush at 10 percent of the VVI. For example, ground rush
         occurs around 400 feet at 4,000 feet per minute (fp m) rate of descent. The combination of hi gh
         sink and low altitude requires an immediate stall r ecovery, and even that might not be enough. It is
         likely the IP recognized the ground rush and instinctively executed a go-around, but either entered
         a stall or was unable to stop the descent at the low altitude.
         67.3.3. Bottom line: Keep the VVI in your cross-check. As a rule of thumb, a 1,500-foot pattern
         generates around 2,000 to 2,500 fpm inthe final turn, a 1,800-footpattern generates 2,500 to 3,000
         fpm, and a 2,000-foot pattern generates 3,000 to 3,500 fpm. Consider going around if your pattern
         spacing requires an additional 500 fpm over the upper limit, and seriousl y consider executing a
         stall recovery if your VVI exceeds the upper limit by more than 1,000 fpm.
      67.4. Action Taken. Reviewed ways to teach practice traffic pattern stall recognition and recovery to
      maximize the learning transfer to actual traffic pattern stalls.

68. Stall—Final Approach:
      68.1. Mishap (Figure 68.). The profile consisted of a heavyweight single-engine pattern followed by
      departure to the area. The crew spent approximately 15 minutes in the area and then returned to the
      pattern for a no-flap, strai ght-in approach to the center runway followed by overhead patterns to the
      outside runway. The first four overhead patterns were uneventful , but the aircraft impacted 40 feet
      short of the overrun on the fifth patte rn. The aircraft departed the le ft side of the overrun and rolled
      inverted, shattering the IP’s windshield frame and causing him fatal in   juries. The SP survived, but was
      seriously injured.

Figure 68. Stall—Final Approach.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              101


   68.2. Investigation:
      68.2.1. Operator Factor. The SP got slow on final and failed to add power in t ime to stop the
      ensuing sink rate.
      68.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to recognize the de veloping danger and take effective
      action.
   68.3. Lesson Learned:
      68.3.1. More T-38 aircraft and crew s have been lost in the final turn than in any other phase of
      flight. Stay vigilant in the traf fic pattern and keep the airspeed, AOA, VVI, and powe r in your
      cross-check.
      68.3.2. Avoid the temptation to relax because you are near the end of the sortie. It is not over until
      you are back in the crew van. Crews may also be fatigued at the end of a demanding sortie. Com-
      bat fatigue by staying hydrated, getting plenty of rest, eating healthy, and getting the right amount
      of exercise.
   68.4. Action Taken. None.

69. Gear Extension Failure:
   69.1. Mishap (Figure 69.). The mission was a weather check flight. The pilot lowered the landing
   gear handle during recovery as usual, but the left main and nose gear did not extend. Furthermore, the
   release cable failed during the alternate gear extension. The crew was unable to correct the problem so
   they flew to the controlled bailout area and ejected. The aircraft im pacted the ground and was
   destroyed.

Figure 69. Gear Extension Failure.




   69.2. Investigation (Supervisory Factor):
      69.2.1. Maintenance supe rvision and specialist training were inadequa te to ensure thorough
      checks of the landing gear alternate release cable. This is T landing gear alternate release cables
                                                                   -38
102                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


         had begun to fail 4 years prior to this mishap, but logistics managers fa iled to take appropriate
         action to correct the problem.
         69.2.2. Inadequate management and poorly conducted inspections resulted in a failure to detect
         the defective landing gear alternate release cable. The normal landing gear system probably failed
         due to a malfunction of th e landing gear door sequencing switch or some other electrical compo-
         nent. The crew activated the landing gear alternate release system, but the cable failed and the gear
         did not extend.
      69.3. Lesson Learned. Maintenance failed to use the material deficiency reporting system correctly.
      When used properly, this system is a great tool and gi ves system managers an opportunity to correct
      inspection criteria or modify a defective system. This information system is a critical part of any suc-
      cessful mishap prevention program, but users must be disciplined and profess ional in reporting dis-
      crepancies.
      69.4. Action Taken:
         69.4.1. Added the following caution to the appropriate TOs:


                                                 CAUTION
          Inspect cable within D-handle locknut. Failure to detect a defective alternate release cable
          within the D-handle locknut may result in cable failu re and loss of emer gency gear
          extension capability.

         69.4.2. Added the requirement to inspect the landing gear alternate release cable within the lock-
         nut.
         69.4.3. To the on-the-job training program, added the requi rement to inspect the landing gear
         alternate release cable within the D-handle locknut.
         69.4.4. Reevaluated landing gear alternate releas e D-handle assembly de sign to eliminate the
         cable’s common failure point.

70. Stall—Final Turn:
      70.1. Mishap (Figure 70.). The mission was a solo contact trai ning sortie. The mi shap aircraft
      reported initial, pitched out, and reported gear down uneven tfully. The RSU noticed a problem
      approximately 12 seconds later and tr ansmitted, “Final turn, monitor altitude, (pause) final turn, go
      around, use burners.” The mishap aircraft went below the tree line seco nds later and impacted the
      ground. The SP was fatally injured.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                103


Figure 70. Stall—Final Turn.




   70.2. Investigation (Operator Factor). The SP allowed th e aircraft to enter a high sink rate during
   the final turn.
   70.3. Lesson Learned:
      70.3.1. Once the RSU crew recognized the gravity of the situation, they made every effort to warn
      the pilot. However, it was too late once the high sink rate developed. While RSU controllers exer-
      cise positive control over the traffic pattern by paying special attention to solos, they cannot fly the
      aircraft for them.
      70.3.2. Solo SPs should be extra cons  ervative in the pattern. As an SP, if the spacing does not look
      right or you are behind at the perch, break out. If the final turn is not quite right, go-around early,
      but do not exceed your maximum allowable AOA while doing it.
      70.3.3. As an SP, you probably do not ha ve enough experi ence for the hairs to stand up on the
      back of your head when they should, but if you ev er find yourself thinking “oh, this is bad,” exe-
      cute a stall recovery immediately! It is better to be back on the ground explaining your actions to
      the RSU controller or the flight commander than to have someone else explaining your mishap to
      your parents or other loved ones.
   70.4. Action Taken. None.

71. Stall—Final Turn:
   71.1. Mishap (Figure 71.). The mission was a dual contact studen t training sortie. The mishap air-
   craft took off and immediately exec uted a closed pullup to enter the overhead pattern. The SP made
   the required closed downwind and gear down radio calls to the RSU. The aircraft was approximately
   a third of the way through the final turn when it rapidly increased bank and pitched down. The aircraft
   impacted the side of a small ridgeline seconds later. The IP ejected about 2.5 seconds prior to aircraft
   impact, and the student pilot ejected just prior to impact. Both ej ections were out of the safe ejection
104                                                                     AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


      envelope, and both crewme mbers were fatally injured. The airc raft caught fire upon impact and was
      destroyed.

Figure 71. Stall—Final Turn.




      71.2. Investigation:
         71.2.1. Operator Factor. The SP performed a closed pullup im mediately after takeoff, although
         it had not been planned or brie fed. The crew failed to plan for the higher-than-normal final turn
         speed and did not get suf ficient runway displacement o n downwind. The SP also became rushed
         and failed to extend th e landing gear. The SP wa s distracted by the landing gear warning horn
         shortly after entering the final turn and allowed the airspeed to dissipate. Neither pilot recognized
         the impending stall. The aircraft eventually stalled with insufficient altitude for safe recovery.
         71.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to notic e the i mproper configuration, became dis-
         tracted by the landing ge ar warning system, and did not anti cipate the impending stall. The IP
         decided to eject rather than execute a stall recovery and commanded the SP to bail out. However,
         both were outside the safe ejection envelope.
      71.3. Lesson Learned. The SP may not have been up to the taskdue to fatigue. He had not consumed
      sufficient nutrition in the 15 hours prior to the mishap. The IP may have gotten behind the aircraft due
      to a 2-week break in flying due to leave. He may have also be en complacent based on the student’ s
      prior performance. Finally, the crew failed to br ief the heavy weight closed pullup. Bottom line: The
      crew was not prepared to perform the maneuver and should have modified their mission pr ofile to
      eliminate the risk.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                           105


   71.4. Action Taken. A closed pullup from initial takeoff was evaluated and eventually became a pro-
   hibited maneuver.

72. Circling Approach:
   72.1. Mishap (Figure 72.). The mishap occurred on the final leg of a 3-day cross country. This sortie
   was the second of the day (the si xth overall) and was uneventful from takeoff to arrival at the home
   airfield. The SP was in the RCP for syl labus-directed instrument training. The SP flew two ILS
   approaches before the IP executed a clo sed pattern. The IP ended up on downwind between the cir-
   cling MDA and the normal overhead pattern altitude. The IP configured the aircraft, using circling
   procedures and planning to full stop. The IP overshot final and was correcting to the runway when the
   aircraft impacted the grou nd. The aircraft was one-third of a mile short of the ap proach end on a
   45-degree intercept heading. Both pilots were fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed.

Figure 72. Circling Approach.




   72.2. Investigation (Operator Factor):
      72.2.1. The IP had not performed a circling approach for approximately 5 months. He misjudged
      the base turn and oversh ot so far that he coul d not get back on runway centerline until he was
      inside one half mile to the threshold.
106                                                                       AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


         72.2.2. The IP decided to salvage the landing versus going around. He may have been so focused
         on making the runway that he failed to notice the aircraft entering a stall. Contributing factors may
         have been (1) impaired judgment due to fatigue ( only 5 to 6 hours of rest the night before), (2) a
         lack of recent solid food intake ( 16 hours since last meal ), (3) a lack of self -discipline, (4) pride
         and overconfidence (not wanting to lose face in front of the SP and overshooting before and been
         able to land), and (5) channelized attention due to a perceived low-fuel state.
      72.3. Lesson Learned:
         72.3.1. Previously during the cross country, the IP had given the SP an unsatisfactory grade for a
         circling approach. He may have been frustrated at his own poor performance and let his pride get
         the better of his judgment in an attempt to sa lvage the approach as well as his credibility. The IP
         had occasionally overbanked to correct previous overshoots with the erroneous justification that
         “momentary deviations” in bank angle were allowable.
         72.3.2. The IP’s loose interpretation of directives and poor flight discipline, combined with pride,
         inadequate crew rest, and lack of nutrition, may have influenced him to continue the approach ver-
         sus taking it around. The main lesson for IPs is that the sure way to regain or maintain your credi-
         bility is to acknowledge your mi stakes. You lose more by cove ring them up because SPs notice
         and take your actions as the example.
      72.4. Action Taken:
         72.4.1. Reevaluated the need for an aural AOA in the T-38 training environment. The IP’s atten-
         tion may have been focused on vi sual cues to t he exclusion of al l else. An aural tone may have
         alerted him to a problem, reminding him to cross-check his parameters.
         72.4.2. Expanded command guidance concerning proper crew rest and nutrition.
         72.4.3. Continue d emphasis on co mmand programs to educ ate T-38 aircrews on exces sive sink
         rates and traffic pattern stalls—specifically causes, early recognition, and recovery procedures.
         72.4.4. Changed circling approach requirements from semiannually to quarterly.

73. Stall—Touch and Go:
      73.1. Mishap (Figure 73.). The flight was a pre-solo contact review sortie. The crew returned to the
      overhead pattern after completing the area work. The SP flared high and pulled the throttles to idle on
      the first no-flap landing. The IP directed the student to add power, and the RSU controller transmitted
      “flare go-around” on the radio. The SP fail ed to add power as directed by the IP, and the ai rcraft
      started to wing rock. Just after th e left wingtip contacted the runway , the RSU controller transmitted
      “go around, use burners,” and the IP assumed aircraft control. The aircraft departed the left side of the
      runway and went abruptly airborne in a very nose-high attitude. The SP perceived the aircraft would
      impact the ground and pulled both throttles to idle. The IP initiated ejection, but was fatally injured
      during the attempt. The SP did not eject and sustained major injuries that were not life-threatening.
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                107


Figure 73. Stall—Touch and Go.




   73.2. Investigation:
      73.2.1. Operator Factor. The SP flared high and pulled both throttles to idle during an attempted
      no-flap landing, placing the aircraft in a hazardous position. The SP was ta sk saturated with the
      resultant wing rock and failed to respond to IP and RSU controller inputs.
      73.2.2. Supervisory Factor. The IP delayed taking the aircra ft and allowed the situation to
      develop.
      73.2.3. Operator Factor. The SP interfered with the IP’ s recovery by retarding both throttles to
      idle.
   73.3. Lesson Learned. IPs routinely let situations progress in order to maximize learning, but there
   is a fine line between far enough and too far . In this case, the IP let the situation progress beyond his
   ability to correct it. Pilots, particularly IPs, should strive to make as accurate an assessment of their
   capabilities as possible. They should never let a s ituation progress to the limit, always giving them-
   selves some slack for things like SP interference during transfer of aircraft control.
   73.4. Action Taken. Reviewed existing flight manuals and ot her training documents to ensure ade-
   quacy of landing and go-around guidanc e. Increased emphasis on the IP ’s responsibility to quickly
   identify and correct potentially hazar dous situations before they prog ress too far. Proper transfer of
   aircraft control continues to be a high emphasis item during all preflight briefings.

74. Final Approach Crash:
   74.1. Mishap (Figure 74.). The mission was an instru ment qualification training sortie at a nearby
   out base for the pre-PIT SP in the back seat. This was the SP’s second instrument sortie in the aircraft.
   The IP and SP were interrupted du ring their mission briefing due to a schedule change and departed
   the building without a complete briefing. The crew conducted severa l nonstandard procedures
   throughout the flight. At some point in the mission, the IP filled out the AFTO Form 781 with final
   landing and mission times. In addition, all of the IP’s flight publications were found stored in the map
108                                                                    AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006


      case. Evidence implies the crew did not work jointly to accomplish the mission. The first penetration
      approach to an ILS final with missed approach was uneventful. There was some confusion on the sec-
      ond approach over whether the SP would fly an ILS orlocalizer approach. He began his descent to the
      MDA passing the FAF, but kept descending and crashed 2.2 miles short of the r unway. The SP
      attempted to recover the aircraft before impact, but he was too lo w and slow to be successful. He
      ejected from the RCP as the airc raft rolled across the ground and began to break up, but was fatally
      injured in the attempt. The IP stayed with the aircraft and egressed after it came to rest.

Figure 74. Final Approach Crash.




      74.2. Investigation:
         74.2.1. Operator Factor. The IP was complacent and overestimated his abilities due to his exten-
         sive familiarity with the training environment. His inflated self-image also led to a disregard for
         established procedures.
         74.2.2. Operator Factor. The SP descended below the MDA due to his limited proficiency and
         lack of exposure to nonprecision approaches.
         74.2.3. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to correct the SP’ s deviations during the approach.
         Most importantly, the IP did not take control of the aircraft on ce the dangerous situation devel-
         oped.
      74.3. Lesson Learned. As we have said befo re, complacency can kill you. This mishap provides an
      addendum—if your complacency does not kill you, it may kill someone else. Do not get comfortable.
      Force yourself to keep a good cross-check going, keep your mi nd actively enga ged by setting c hal-
      lenging objectives for every flight, and enforce strong flight discipline.

75. Instrument Approach:
   75.1. Mishap (Figure 75.). The mission was a navigation sortie on the last leg of a weekend cross
   country. The mishap crew departed from an out base and planned to drop in at a nearby field for an
   instrument approach. The SP was flying from the front seat to fulfill syllabus requirements. Air traffic
   control was providing radar vectors for the drop-in approach and initially directed the SP to climb to
   5,000 feet. After handoff, the next controller directed a descent to 3,000 feet. Immediately after the SP
   leveled off and made his approach request, he col lided with a civilian Cessna 172. (The SP had been
   airborne for about 6 minutes.) The Cessna had a ci vilian flight instructor and SP on board and had
   taken off approximately 18 minutes prior to the collision. The civilian crew had taken off from a local
   airfield and flown south to a practice area. Once they were outside the 20 nm outer limit of the airport
   radar service area (AR SA), the controller had terminated radar se rvice and cleared th e Cessna VFR.
   The Cessna crew had performed a series of stalls and was making a turn to the northwest when it col-
   lided with the T-38. The Cessna’s engine was sheared off at the firewall, and the aircrew performed an
   emergency landing on a nearby highw ay. The T-38 aircrew ejected with minor injuries, but the T -38
   was destroyed upon ground impact.

Figure 75. Instrument Approach.




   75.2. Investigation:
      75.2.1. Operator Factor. The T-38 IP had limited visibility in the RCP. The SP in the FCP had
      better visibility, but was focuse d in the cockpit while setting up his navigational aids (NAVAID)
      for an ILS approach. The SP saw the Cessna priorto impact, but did not have enough time to avoid
      colliding with it.
      75.2.2. Operations Factors. The Cessna IP exhibited poor airmanship. He was operating VFR
      on the edge of a major military base’s ARSA. Furthermore, his location was in the vicinity of the
      radar transition to final approach.
      75.2.3. Other Factors. The radar controller did not provide ai rcraft separation or traf fic adviso-
      ries.
   75.3. Lesson Learned. Civilian pilots are not al ways familiar with operatio ns at a military base so
   aircrews should expect to see them pressing through the traffic pattern on occasion. Aircrews should
   use good CRM below 3,000 AGL to ensure both pilots are not focused inside the aircraft at the same
   time. And as always, clear, clear, clear.
   75.4. Action Taken. None.

76. Stall—Touch and Go:
      76.1. Mishap (Figure 76.). This was the SP’s first sortie in th e T-38. The mish ap crew completed
      area work and then returned to the home field topractice patterns and landings. During the second pat-
      tern, the SP flared high while attempting to land. The RSU controller directed the mishap crew to go
      around. The aircraft continued in the high flare until the left wing stalled and dropped, rolling the air-
      craft into approximately 90 degrees of left bank. The RSU directed the mishap crew to “use burners”!
      The aircraft entered a heavy wing rock and began oscillating in yaw, all with a nose high attitude. The
      RSU transmitted, “lower your nose. ” The aircraft nose came down a nd the oscillations dampened as
      the aircraft veered off from the runway at less than 80 feet AGL. It appears that the IP raised the flaps
      from full down to 60 percent some time during this se   quence. The aircraft seemed to gain altitude, but
      the nose pitched up again after just a few seconds. The aircra ft rolled abruptly to nearly 135 degrees
      of right bank and the nose dropped rapidly. The aircraft impacted the ground and was destroyed. Nei-
      ther crewmember attempted to eject, and both were fatally injured.

Figure 76. Stall—Touch and Go.




      76.2. Investigation:
         76.2.1. Supervisory Factor. The IP failed to recognize an im pending stall and did not execute a
         proper stall recovery in a timely manner.
         76.2.2. Operator Factor. The IP failed to ensure the engines were operating in full afterburner
         during the initial wing rock. I t is possible he focused his attention on raising the flaps to reduce
         induced drag.
         76.2.3. Operator Factor. After the RSU directed the aircrew to lower the nose , the IP released
         sufficient back pressure to bre ak the stall. As the aircraft angled aw ay from the runway, it was
         heading toward the control tower and some other buildings. The IP increased back stick pressure
         and selected afterburner to avoid the structures, but induced a secondary stall in the process.
      76.3. Lesson Learned. The IP would have been able to recove r from the wing rock sooner if he had
      used the afterburners immediately. A high flare can be very dangerous because of two interacting fac-
      tors: The airspeed decreases while AOA and induced drag increase. This increases the power required
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                                 111


   to accelerate or su stain level flight. The thrott les are most likely at idle which cr eates a lag in your
   ability to command more thrust. Even if you throttle burst to military power, it will take a few
   moments before the engines are actually generating military thrust. By the time the engines are cook-
   ing, you have already lost more airspeed and/or al titude. For these reasons, consider using afterburn-
   ers any tim e you i nitiate a go-a round after beginning the flare. Keep flying the aircraft while the
   engines spool up and realize the airc raft may touch down in the proce ss. Allow the airc raft to touch
   down on the runway versus increasing back stick pressure to the point of stalling the aircraft.
   76.4. Action Taken. Implemented a stall training program in which an IP must complete a stall train-
   ing sortie conducted by a specially trained stall pilot before the IP’s qualification check ride. Program
   requirements also include an annual stall seminar and a semiannual requirement to practice stalls and
   recoveries with another IP during a CT mission.

77. Bird Strike, Engine Failure—Touch and Go:
   77.1. Mishap (Figure 77.). The mishap crew was on a dual pre-so lo formation sor tie flown in the
   local area. Aft er completing area wo rk, the mishap crew returned to the home fiel d for a formati on
   approach and pattern work. The SP saw a brown flash on the left side of the aircraft on departure from
   the first touch and go. The flash turned out to be a bird, which went down the left intake. The aircraft
   was at 165 knots and 30 to 50 feet AGL with 6,000 to 7,000 fe et of runway remaining. Both crew-
   members heard a loud crunch or ba ng as the left engine faile d catastrophically. The master caution,
   left hydraulic, and left generator lights illuminated. The aircraft yawed and rolled left. The SP applied
   rudder to straighten out the aircraft. The IP assumedcontrol of the aircraft and placed the right throttle
   in afterburner. He direct ed the SP to open the th rottle gate. The IP checke d the airspeed (now 145
   knots) and set the flaps at 60 pe rcent. The mishap aircraft woul d not accelerate above 145 knots and
   remained at or below 50 feet AGL as it continued dow n the runway. With only 1,500 feet of runway
   remaining, the IP told the SP “prepare to eject.” The aircraft began to descend, and the IP commanded
                                 ,
   ejection. He saw the flash from SP’s ejection and simultaneously noticed the barrier passing under the
   nose of the aircraft. The main landing gear contacted the barrier webbing, pulling the barrier cable to
   the bottom of the mishap aircraft. The cable became lodged in the hinge point of the left stab and tore
   the stab from the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch down. The IP initiated his ejection, leaving the
   aircraft as the nose impacted the ground. Although the IP’s ejection and initial parachute deployment
   were normal, the parachute collapsed and did not inflate prior to ground impact. The IP sustained seri-
   ous injuries on landing. Once on the ground, his par   achute dragged him until the SP released him. The
   aircraft continued to skid another 1,500 feet across a highway embankment and onto a railroad track,
   sustaining major damage.

Figure 77. Bird Strike, Engine Failure—Touch and Go.




      77.2. Investigation:
         77.2.1. Natural and Environmental Material Factor. The left engine ingested a horned lark on
         the departure leg of a touch and go, causing a compressor stall and engine failure.
         77.2.2. Logistics and Material Factor. The right engine failed to achieve maximum afterburner
         due to a binding cam in the T-5 motor.
         77.2.3. Environmental Factor. The barrier became entangled with the bottom of the aircraft,
         ultimately severing the left stab.
         77.2.4. Operator Factor. The IP failed to make a timely ejection decision.
      77.3. Lesson Learned. Several unrelated events interacted and rapidly placed the aircrew behind the
      power curve. Emergencies during the takeoff and landing phase leave little room for error, and there is
      a very small difference between successful and unsu ccessful ejection parameters. Waiting that extra
      second may place you outside th e envelope. Think about your ej ection decision beforehand and be
      prepared to execute. Decide now what you will do if you apply a boldface or recovery procedure, but
      the aircraft does not respond as expected.
      77.4. Action Taken:
         77.4.1. Expanded command guidance for emergency procedures simulators to include compound
         and multiple emer gency situations, scenarios requiring ejection, an d thrust-deficient, sin-
         gle-engine go-arounds.
         77.4.2. Continued development of a CRM program for UPT and specialized UPT.

78. Blown Tire and Runway Departure:
      78.1. Mishap (Figure 78.). The mishap sortie was a CT mission for the IP in the RCP . The mishap
      crew was executing a no-flap touch and go with a le crosswind of 19 knots. The RCP IP heard a loud
                                                        ft
AETCH11-210 13 MARCH 2006                                                                              113


   bang soon after touchdown and determined the left tire had blown. He initia ted an abort by bringing
   the throttles to idle and directing tow er to raise the BAK-15 barrier. The IP began to max aerobrake
   with approximately 5,200 feet of runway remaining. At 4,000 feet remaining, the aircraft drifted right,
   causing the right tire to blow as well. The RCP IP used a combination of braking, rudder, and nose-
   wheel steering in an effort to maintain directional control. Despite these efforts, the aircraft departed
   the runway at 50 to 80 knots and struck a barrier stanchion (a 5.5 inch steel pole). The pole impacted
   the left side of th e aircraft, causing substantial damage. The pole a nd nose gear sheared of f, and the
   right main gear collapsed. Impact forces caused the FCP ejection seat to fire. The ejection was outside
   the envelope under high wind conditions, and the FCP IP was fatally inju red. The RCP IP egressed
   without injury.

Figure 78. Blown Tire and Runway Departure.




   78.2. Investigation:
      78.2.1. Supervisory Factor. TO 1T-38A-1; MCMAN 1 1-238, Volume 2, (A)T-38 Mission
      Employment Fundamentals; and AETC S tudy Guide P- V4A-A-SO-EP; T-38 Systems Analysis/
      Emergency Action Guide; contained conflicting guidance regarding go/no-go decisions, Guidance
      for no-flap touch and go and tire wear during crosswind landings was nonexistent.
      78.2.2. Material Factor. The left tire blew for an unknown reason. Crosswinds, gross weight,
      pilot technique, and runway surface were possible contributing factors.
      78.2.3. Operator. The RCP IP performed an aggressive ae robrake instead of prioritizing direc-
      tional control. The aggressive aerobrake allowed the aircraft to drift right, blowing the right tire.
   78.3. Lesson Learned:
      78.3.1. This mishap revealed several areas needing clarification regarding the go/no-go decisions.
      Additionally, the impact of cros swinds on directional control and tire stress needed to be
      addressed in more detail to prevent another such occurrence.
      78.3.2. Pilots also need to be reminded that aggressive aerobr aking can significantly degrade
      directional control during strong c rosswinds. However, due to too much aerobraking (trying to
      stop the aircraft), the RCP IP allowed the aircraft to drift off the runway. The priority should have
      been to properly minimize aerobraking (thereby preventing runway departure) even if it made bar-
      rier engagement likely.

      78.4. Action Taken:
         78.4.1. Directed comprehensive review and revision of all written guidance in TO 1T-38A-1, TO
         1T-38C-1, Flight Manual—T-38C Aircraft (Boeing); MCMAN 11-238, Volume 2; and AETC
         Study Guide P-V4A-A-SO-EP; that pertains to go/no-go decisions for takeoff, landing, and touch
         and go, including no-flap and single engine situations.
         78.4.2. Developed and published additional guidance regarding no-flap crosswind procedures.
         78.4.3. Recommended additional guidance regarding tire wear during crosswind landings. Main-
         tenance directives were changed to include additional guidance on T-38 tire inspections.
         78.4.4. Developed a plan to install anti-skid braking in the T-38.
         78.4.5. Developed a plan to procure and install ejection seats with a larger ejection envelop in the
         T-38.

Section F—A Final Thought

79. What Have We Learned? The “ROAD TO WINGS” is demanding and unforgiving, exacting heavy
tolls in terms of human life and material resources. While these losses are tragic, the greater tragedy
would be failing to learn history’ s lessons and paying the same toll s again. We hope the knowledge pre-
sented here bolsters the experience of those who follow and smoothes the road ahead.
