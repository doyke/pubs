                                            Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Scope. The purpose of this instruction is to serve as a general reference document
describing local flying, airport and Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, flight planning and
airspace utilization procedures at Barksdale Air Force Base. The term “local aircraft” used
throughout this instruction refers to all United States Air Force (USAF) Headquarters Global
Strike Command (HQ AFGSC) aircraft assigned to, or operated by, the 2d Bomb Wing (2 BW),
49th Test and Evaluation Squadron (49 TES), 340 Weapons Squadron (340 WS) and the 548
Combat Training Squadron (548 CTS). In addition, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
aircraft assigned to the 307 Reserve Wing are designated as “local aircraft.” This publication
applies to all personnel who may use the airspace or airfield, e.g. joint military partners, Air
National Guard (ANG)/AFR, contractors and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians. Maintain
records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
1.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Operations. Aircrews attending formal flying training courses
and/or flying in support of a host unit are considered local aircrews. Aircrews in a formal course
shall receive a phase briefing from the host unit before flying. Aircrews that are not part of a
formal course will receive a local area briefing from a local host unit covering Barksdale AFB
procedures. Deployed unit commanders will ensure their host unit is informed of any additional
training events the deployed unit will accomplish before, during, or after any mission they fly in
support of a Barksdale AFB mission requirement. Aircraft TDY to Barksdale AFB are
authorized to apply paragraph 4.4., Reduced Same Runway Separation, once a letter of
agreement is signed between the host wing and the TDY unit. The host wing will ensure a
detailed briefing is conducted prior to local flying operations.
1.3. Policies. Procedures outlined in this instruction are directive in nature and apply to all units
involved in flying or in support of flying activities at Barksdale AFB. Deviations from existing

     areas within 100 ft. of the runway/overrun edge to include both North and South ILS critical
     areas. Specific approval for entry onto the CMA must be obtained from the ATCT.
     2.3.2. Entry and exit of the CMA requires ATCT approval. During periods of darkness,
     vehicles operating on the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or hazard flashers. All
     individuals, whether in a vehicle or on foot, must maintain two way radio communications
     with the ATCT at all times.
        2.3.2.1. When an individual experiences loss of radio communication with the ATCT,
        the tower will utilize established light gun signals and/or flash runway lights to
        reestablish communication. The individual will exit the runway environment immediately
        upon flashing of the runway lights.
     2.3.3. Instrument Hold Sign (INST). All vehicles must hold short at the INST hold line until
     permission to enter the respective critical area is obtained from the ATCT.
     2.3.4. ILS Critical Area Protection. ILS critical areas are established near the North and
     South runway overruns. Signage marks the boundaries of the ILS critical areas when
     approached from Perimeter Road. All vehicle operators are required to “HOLD SHORT” of
     the area and request access from the ATCT. Vehicle Operators must report to the ATCT
     when out of the area.
     2.3.5. Runway Incursion/Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) or Hazardous Air
     Traffic Report (HATR). In the event of a Runway Incursion/CMAV or HATR, AMOPS will
     take action to apprehend the offender, suspend driving privileges and properly report the
     incident IAW AFMAN 91-223_AFGSC SUP, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports,

      locations. Any B-52 engine run greater than 85% must have at least 500 ft. of clearance
      behind the aircraft, with the exception of one inboard engine being run up to 90% during
      engine start. B-52s exceeding the above power restrictions must be parked at one of the
      following locations:
          2.13.2.1.1. Aircraft backed into Sites 1-20.
          2.13.2.1.2. Delta Hammerhead or spot U3, facing either east or west.
          2.13.2.1.3. Spots V4, W4, X4, Y4 and Z4, positioned at a 45 degree angle to the
          main parallel.
          2.13.2.1.4. These locations must have a spotter present to watch for any mobile
          obstructions that might pass behind an aircraft conducting an engine run. The spotter
          shall instruct maintenance (MX) personnel to reduce the engine power to idle if any
          mobile obstruction approaches the jet blast area.
      2.13.2.2. B-52 aircraft are not allowed to conduct engine runs at greater than 85% power
      while parked in the Aircraft Alert Parking Area (AAPA).
      2.13.2.3. It is not typical for Barksdale AFB to have transient aircraft that would require
      restrictions for engine runs. Should transient heavy aircraft require a high powered
      engine run, taxiways Alpha or Delta will be used.
          2.13.2.3.1. Transient alert services will consult AMOPS prior to conducting full
          powered engine runs.
          2.13.2.3.2. Transient aircraft requiring engine runs greater than 85% power shall
          contact the AFM for approval.

      2.13.3.1. Drag Chute Jettison Areas: Aircraft shall jettison drag chutes on taxiway Alpha
      or Delta once clear of the runway and in the hammerhead area which will ensure that the
      chute will not blow back onto the runway/grass and will remain clear of the taxiway to
      the maximum extent possible.
      2.13.3.2. Drag Chute Recovery Procedures:
          2.13.3.2.1. ATCT shall advise AMOPS of aircraft jettisoning a drag chute if the
          aircraft does not land on the runway in use.
          2.13.3.2.2. AMOPS shall advise TA or MOC to recover jettisoned drag chute. When
          available, TA will recover drag chutes. During times that TA is not available, MOC
          will coordinate drag chute recovery.
   2.13.4. Hot Pit Refueling: Hot Pit refueling is not authorized.
2.14. Aircraft Towing Procedures: Aircraft Towing Procedures. See BAFBI 13-213.

2.15. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes.
   2.15.1. Taxi Operations.
      2.15.1.1. All taxi operations require clearance from ground control. State the appropriate
      ATIS code to ground control when requesting taxi instructions for departure.
      2.15.1.2. ATC may authorize aircraft to taxi without a departure clearance/VFR squawk
      if a filed flight plan is confirmed with AMOPS.
   2.15.2. Wingtip Clearance for Taxiing/Towed B-52’s: Non-standard white markings have
   been painted on the north and south sides of interior taxi lanes of the mass parking apron to
   identify wingtip clearance for taxiing/towed aircraft (Note: wingtip clearance is based on the
   B-52 wingtip clearance criteria, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and
   Heliport Planning and Design. Once the B-52 is established on the interior taxi lane
   centerline there is 30 ft. of wingtip clearance between the B-52 wingtip and the white line
   until the B-52 starts a turn into/out of the parking spot).
      2.15.2.1. No mobile objects shall be positioned between the two white lines that define
      the interior taxi lane during aircraft taxi as designated below in Figure 2.3.
   2.15.3. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE): AGE shall be stored on sites 5 and 21.
   Additionally, the approved munitions (MUNS) storage location is Stub D. MUNS equipment
   will be kept behind non-standard white markings painted on the entrance to the Stub. These
   markings indicate appropriate wing tip clearance from B-52 aircraft taxiing out of the Alert
   Aircraft Parking Area. AGE used for aircraft launch and recovery may not be staged on
   aircraft parking ramps 3 hours before engine start and must be removed no later than 3 hours
   after departure.
   2.15.4. AMOPS will conducts checks to ensure AGE equipment is properly stored and
   coordinate correction of violations to MOC or other appropriate agencies. Trends and
   recurring violations will be elevated and briefed to MXG/CC and OG/CC at quarterly AOBs.

        Net to the maximum extent possible.
        2.24.3.1.3. Confirmation of termination for the escort will be relayed to the ATCT
        via landline.
        2.24.3.1.4. Telephone will be the landline back up. Telephone monitoring is
        secondary to ATC duties, but will be accomplished to the maximum extent possible
        until runway crossing is complete.
     2.24.3.2. The ATCT shall:
        2.24.3.2.1. Suspend all runway operations, including restricted low approaches prior
        to the escort leaving the Munitions Storage Area (MSA), generation area or secure
        area.
        2.24.3.2.2. Notify AMOPS that runway operations have been suspended and
        expected time runway operations will resume.
     2.24.3.3. AMOPS must conduct a runway check before runway operations can be
     resumed.
     2.24.3.4. Ensure that forward firing aircraft such as an A-10 avoid any taxiing movement
     that might cause the aircraft to turn in the direction of a PNAF aircraft to the maximum
     extent possible IAW AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
     2.24.3.5. Refer to all escort movements as “SPECIAL EXERCISE.”
     2.24.3.6. The following procedures will be followed in all generation operations:
        2.24.3.6.1. BDOC will call the ATCT and request that ATCT monitor BDOC NET
        for Escort Commander.
        2.24.3.6.2. Tower will establish radio contact with the Escort Commander who will
        inform Tower of the intended route.
        2.24.3.6.3. During initial radio contact with ATCT, the Escort Commander will
        request preliminary crossing of all vehicles IAW AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, and

MERCURY ONE REQUEST RUNWAY PRELIMINARY CROSSING ALPHA/BRAVO
TAXIWAY.”
ATCT: “MERCURY ONE, BARKSDALE TOWER, PRELIMINARY CROSSING
ACKNOWLEDGED. HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY.”
       2.24.3.7. After this initial radio contact, the ATCT will allow an aircraft on landing roll
       to continue, breakout all VFR or IFR traffic, suspend all engine runs along the escort
       route and ensure the route is completely sterilized.
           2.24.3.7.1. As needed, ATCT will coordinate with AMOPS to ensure route is
           sterilized.
       2.24.3.8. After positive radio contact is established with all agencies the Escort
       Commander will request (through BDOC) permission to roll from the 2 BW/CC.
       2.24.3.9. After the 2 BW/CC grants permission and the route is sterilized, the ATCT will
       approve escort runway crossing. Escort Commanders must wait for ATCT approval for
       runway crossing prior to leaving the restricted area or Weapons Storage Area.
           2.24.3.9.1. Example Phraseology:
Escort Commander (after Wing CC approves escort): “BARKSDALE TOWER, MERCURY
ONE (PLUS # OF VEHICLES ESCORTED) REQUEST FINAL CROSSING ALPHA/BRAVO
TAXIWAY.”
If tower is still awaiting route sterilization: ATCT: “MERCURY ONE, BARKSDALE TOWER,
STANDBY FOR TRAFFIC PATTERN AND ROUTE STERILIZATION. HOLD SHORT OF
RUNWAY.”
(Traffic pattern and escort route sterilization should be a priority and happen as expeditiously as
possible.)
If route is verified sterilized: ATCT: “MERCURY ONE, CROSS RUNWAY 15/33 AT
ALPHA/ BRAVO, REPORT WHEN OFF.”
       2.24.3.10. The Escort Commander will report all vehicles are off runway after crossing is
       complete. In addition, the Escort Commander or BDOC must again notify the ATCT
       immediately upon termination of escort operations (or when inside the secure area).
       Upon completion of a runway check by AMOPS, the ATCT will in turn resume normal
       runway operations.
           2.24.3.10.1. Example Phraseology:
Escort Commander: “BARKSDALE TOWER, MERCURY ONE (PLUS # OF VEHICLES
ESCORTED) ARE OFF THE RUNWAY.”
ATCT: “MERCURY ONE, ROGER. REMAIN OFF RUNWAY.” (Tower may authorize
straight-in full stop landings or IFR “runway heading” departures only).

     4.2.3.4. Aircraft shall remain within a 5 NM radius of the airport’s geographical center
     unless the pilot requests and ATC authorizes the pilot to exceed the 5 NM limit.
     4.2.3.5. Re-Entry for a Straight-In: Pilots desiring a straight-in shall restate their request
     for a straight-in once established on the downwind. ATCT approval for the straight-in
     shall be given by “STRAIGHT-IN APPROVED”, followed by a reporting point (i.e.
     report 3 mile final, report base). Pilots should descend to 1,200 ft. MSL when turning to
     base and proceed to a 3 to 5-mile final.
     4.2.3.6. Re-Entry for Initial: Pilots shall fly via the outside downwind, proceed to and
     report a 3 mile initial.
  4.2.4. Simulated Flameout Approaches (SFOs).           SFO procedures are not authorized at

  pattern IAW the following:
     4.2.6.1. Outside 5 mile final, the ATCT may instruct an aircraft to breakout. The pilot
     may request to breakout at any time outside 5 mile final.
     4.2.6.2. Pilots shall advise ATCT they are “BREAKING OUT” and shall execute a
     climbing turn, left /right depending on the runway in use, direct to Flag Lake,
     maintaining 2,200 ft. MSL.
     4.2.6.3. Pilots shall report reaching Flag Lake and request further instructions. If the
     ATCT directs the pilot to re-enter downwind the pilot shall begin descending to 1,700 ft.
     MSL en-route to join at the midfield downwind. Pilots shall reenter downwind at a 45º
     angle, abeam midfield.
     4.2.6.4. Traffic permitting, pilots may request to report short initial in lieu of proceeding
     to Flag Lake. ATCT shall approve or deny any such request based on other traffic
     considerations.

  4.2.7. Fighter VFR Pattern Recovery/Entry Points (Fig 4.2). Fighter-type aircraft may
  recover VFR to initial only (no straight-ins) via the VFR recovery points: North Point
  (Runway 15) or South Point (Runway 33). This option is available when SHV RAPCON is
  unable to clear the flight direct to initial due to radar pattern saturation or when the pilots
  expect sequencing delays. Pilots shall use these entry points IAW the following guidance:
     4.2.7.1. Barksdale AFB weather must report a ceiling of 2,800 ft. or greater and visibility
     of 3 miles or greater.
     4.2.7.2. Pilots shall fly over the appropriate entry point at 2,500 ft. MSL then descend to
     1,700 ft. MSL and fly direct to a 3 to 4 mile initial.
     4.2.7.3. Pilots must use extreme caution to “see and avoid” other aircraft, particularly
     those on an instrument approach and those on the outside downwind or 90º to initial.
     Aircraft entering from North/South point have the right of way over aircraft already
     established on outside downwind or 90º to initial.
     4.2.7.4. Aircraft on outside downwind or 90º to initial shall yield to and breakout as
     necessary to de-conflict from North/South Point entry leg aircraft

   4.3.1. NAVAID Flight Check (FC).
      4.3.1.1. Aircraft engaged in FC of NAVAIDs shall receive priority IAW FAA JO
      7110.65.
      4.3.1.2. The AOF/CC shall coordinate with appropriate facilities as soon as information
      of a scheduled FC is received from the FAA. FC operations often require special
      participation of ground personnel, specific communications, RADAR operation
      capabilities and opposite direction approaches.
      4.3.1.3. When a FC is in progress, the ATCT shall:
          4.3.1.3.1. Transmit on the ATIS: “FLIGHT CHECK IN PROGRESS AND MAY BE
          OPERATING OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO NORMAL TRAFFIC.”
          4.3.1.3.2. Typically the FC aircraft will inform the ATCT of degradations of
          NAVAID services during the flight check and/or immediately after. Upon receipt of
BARKSDALEAFBI11-250 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            35


           this information, the ATCT shall notify SHV RAPCON and AMOPS if any
           NAVAIDS have degraded services.
           4.3.1.3.3. Notify the Tower Chief Controller (CCTLR) and AOF/CC when the FC
           aircraft is inbound and when the FC is complete.
   4.3.2. Protection of the VFR Overhead Traffic Pattern (All Aircraft).
        4.3.2.1. When ceiling and visibility permits VFR overhead pattern operations, all
        departing aircraft, including those on initial take-off and those executing the departure
        phase of a missed approach, low approach, touch-and-go, or stop-and-go, shall maintain
        at or below 1,200 ft. MSL until reaching the departure end of the runway unless ATCT
        directs otherwise.
        4.3.2.2. ATCT shall instruct departing transient aircraft to “maintain at or below one
        thousand two hundred feet until departure end.”
4.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures.
   4.4.1. AFI 11-202v3_AFGSC SUP, General Flight Rules and supplemental guidance from
   HQ AF Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) authorizes the following RSRS procedures that
   the ATCT shall apply to locally assigned aircraft:
   4.4.2. Pilots may refuse RSRS at any time and should notify the ATCT of their refusal as
   soon as possible or upon initial contact.
   4.4.3. Controllers may refuse RSRS at any time for safety of flight.
   4.4.4. RSRS criteria are based on aircraft characteristics, aircrew training requirements and
   controller approval to ensure application of established separation.
   4.4.5. All aircraft must maintain at least 500 ft. lateral or vertical separation when over
   flying aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
   4.4.6. Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 criteria apply when the ceiling and visibility are reported
   greater than basic VFR minima.

5.1. Radar Traffic Patterns.
   5.1.1. B-52 IFR Local Flights-There is limited instrument and transition training available
   during low weather IFR conditions in RAPCON’s airspace. 2 BW aircraft must have 2
   OG/CC approval to conduct multiple approaches when the ceiling is less than 500 ft. AGL
   and/or 1 mile visibility or less. It is the pilot’s responsibility to secure authorization at the
   appropriate level prior to requesting multiple approaches under such conditions.
   5.1.2. Tenant Unit SOF’s may limit operations of their respective unit’s aircraft at any time.
   5.1.3. Local IFR flights must remain inside SHV RAPCON’s airspace (approximately 30
   NM radius of Barksdale AFB, at or below 12,000 ft. MSL).
   5.1.4. Pilots requesting pattern work prior to departing the local area may file an IFR local
   on the flight plan with a delayed proposed enroute IFR departure time.
5.2. Availability/Restrictions of Surveillance and Precision Approaches.
   5.2.1. Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR). ASR is available through SHV RAPCON without
   limitations. Precision approach radar is not available at Barksdale AFB.
   5.2.2. B-52 IFR Local Flights Outside of RAPCON Airspace. IFR local flights extending
   outside of SHV RAPCON airspace must be cleared through the Air Route Traffic Control
   Center (ARTCC). If required, include an alternate airport.
   5.2.3. Arrivals (All Aircraft). Upon initial contact, all arriving aircraft shall inform SHV
   RAPCON of the ATIS code and intentions, including type of approach and landing.
   5.2.4. IFR Arrivals: Expect the ILS to the active runway as the primary approach.
   5.2.5. VFR Arrivals: Should contact SHV RAPCON prior to 25 NM from Barksdale AFB
   and maintain 2,500 ft. MSL.
5.3. Local Departure Procedures.
   5.3.1. IFR Departures (All aircraft):
       5.3.1.1. The standard IFR departure for aircraft departing Barksdale AFB is: “FLY
       RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2,000 ft. MSL.”
       5.3.1.2. B-52 formation departures shall be issued a block altitude from ATC. B-52
       pilots may request a higher altitude for departure from the ATCT.
   5.3.2. Clearance Delivery Procedures.
       5.3.2.1. IFR: Pilots shall request clearance from ground control prior to taxi.
       5.3.2.2. VFR: Pilots shall request a squawk from ground control prior to taxi.
   5.3.3. VFR Fighter Departures
       5.3.3.1. There are two coded fighter-type VFR departure routes.
BARKSDALEAFBI11-250 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   39

       8.19.1.2. Phase 2: Defined as beginning the first of September through the end of
       March.
   8.19.2. During heightened periods of bird activity, flying shall be curtailed.
       8.19.2.1. Moderate:
           8.19.2.1.1. (2 BW) Touch and go landings are prohibited without 2 OG/CC
           approval. If approved, touch and go landings are limited to a maximum of one per
           pilot and may only be conducted provided there are no bird concentrations
           obstructing a normal path to and from the runway.
           8.19.2.1.2. (2 BW) Restrict low approaches to 200 ft. above bird concentrations as
           determined by the SOF.

           8.19.2.2.2. Full stop landings only with OG/CC approval.
   8.19.3. The SOF is the primary authority for declaring a bird watch condition. In the
   absence of a SOF the ATCT WS will determine the bird watch condition, followed by
   AMOPS. Once the bird hazard no longer exists, the appropriate agency will downgrade the
   BWC commensurate with the reduced threat.
   8.19.4. As soon as possible after changing the BWC, the declaring agency shall coordinate
   with the ATCT WS to ensure aircraft in critical phases of flight or aircraft ready for departure
   are advised of the increased or decreased BWC.
8.20. Supervisor of Flying Operating in the Tower. Procedures are outlined in AFI 11-418
Barksdale AFB SUP1. The primary duty location for the SOF during 2 BW flying is the ATCT.
8.21. Airfield Environment.
   8.21.1. Wearing of Hats. IAW BAFBI 13-213, wearing hats on the airfield is not authorized.
   8.21.2. Airfield Smoking Policy. AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety
   Instruction, governs the airfield smoking policy. Smoking is prohibited in aircraft
   maintenance facilities, the flight line areas, and weapons storage and maintenance areas
   except where designated by the installation fire chief in coordination with the functional
   manager and/or supervisor.
   8.21.3. Airfield Photography. The taking of photographs on the airfield is generally not
   allowed; however, exceptions are noted in 2nd Bomb Wing Integrated Defense Plan (2 BW
   IDP) 31-10V1 and V2.
       8.21.3.1. Airfield Operations personnel will be permitted to take photographs as
       necessary for official airfield business, to include but not limited to, pavement conditions,
       grass height, and animal control.
8.22. EOD Planned Detonation. The location of planned detonation is the Barksdale AFB 085
radial, 5.75 DME fix. There are two types of detonation. The electric detonation takes 5
minutes to complete. The non-electric detonation takes 10 to 12 minutes to complete. If there is
a misfire, expect a 60-minute delay of the EOD operation.
 60                                          BARKSDALEAFBI11-250 25 NOVEMBER 2013


   8.22.1. EOD personnel will notify AMOPS and call the ATCT on extension 2116 or over the
   radio and advise of the planned detonation.
   8.22.2. Prior to detonation, EOD personnel shall:
       8.22.2.1. Obtain approval from the ATCT just prior to detonation and advise of expected
       duration and affected altitude.
       8.22.2.2. Advise AMOPS and ATCT of termination.
   8.22.3. ATCT personnel shall:
       8.22.3.1. If detonation will affect the traffic pattern:
           8.22.3.1.1. Coordinate with SHV RAPCON prior to detonation.
           8.22.3.1.2. Advise SHV RAPCON when detonation is complete.
       8.22.3.2. Monitor the Tower Net for the duration of the detonation.
8.23. Non-Standard Maneuvers and Operations. Non-standard maneuvers and operations are
any maneuvers or operations that are unfamiliar to Barksdale AFB ATC and not found in FARs,
FAA operational procedures, LOAs or LOPs.
   8.23.1. Pilots shall not perform non-standard maneuvers or operations without prior approval
   from the 2 OG/CC and the ATCT.
   8.23.2. Tenant units receive approval authority for non-standard maneuvers or operations by
   their respective unit authorized official with ATCT concurrence.
   8.23.3. Unit commanders shall coordinate with the 2 OG/CC to ensure the maneuvers or
   operations do not interfere with the safety of other aircraft operations.
8.24. Aircraft Compass Swing Site. An aircraft compass swing site is required for alignment
after replacement of critical compass components on the B-52. Current regulations for the
placement of a Compass Rose on the airfield are not required due to the advancement of the
equipment. It is critical to ensure this site is easily identified and certified on an annual basis.
   8.24.1. 2 MXG/AFETS will annually certify the site, currently located at Taxiway E, and
   provide documentation of this to the AFM and 2 MXG.
8.25. Airfield Operations Flight Commander Checklist. Within the first 30 days of assuming
the position of AOF/CC, the newly appointed AOF/CC will execute the locally developed
checklist found on OSA’s network drive: \A3\A3A\Airfield Operations Flight\OSA\AOF
Commander\AOF Duties. Ideally this checklist will be executed with the outgoing AOF/CC.
This checklist will help familiarize the incoming AOF/CC with responsibilities outlined in AFI
13-204v3, as well as local responsibilities outlined in this instruction.

Terms
Abandoned Vehicle—Vehicle left on airfield without a driver and is not defined as an
unattended vehicle.
Altitude—All altitudes, except those referring to cloud height and weather, are MSL unless
otherwise indicated.
Airfield—The area immediately to the east of the chain-link fence.          The airfield area is
designated as a controlled area for security purposes.
Distance—All distances, except when describing visibility, are in nautical miles unless
otherwise specified. Visibility distances will be expressed in statute miles or hundreds of feet.
Hazardous Cargo—Explosive, toxic, caustic, nuclear, combustible, flammable, biological,
infectious, or poisonous materials that may directly endanger human life or property if
mishandled or involved in an accident.
Hot Gun—Any system, which has been charged and armed, that firing of the mechanism is
possible from the interior of the aircraft.
Headings—All headings are magnetic.
Hung ordnance (LIVE or INERT)—Weapon(s) that does not separate from the aircraft after an
attempted release and is considered an Unsafe Weapons Condition. An attempted release occurs
when the aircraft issues a release pulse in either automatic or manual mode with all switches
positioned correctly.
Hung live or inert weapon will be considered an emergency situation. Hung ordnance
definition/procedures are located at para 6.8.
The ILS Critical Area Hold Position (Instrument Hold Line see Figure A1.1)—Two
horizontal yellow solid lines perpendicularly connected by pairs of solid yellow lines. ILS

Critical Area Hold Lines are located on the Echo Taxiway. These critical areas along Perimeter
Road are protected by STOP signs. No equipment or vehicles are authorized beyond these lines
or signs without direct authorization from the Control Tower regardless of current weather
conditions.
Instrument Hold line (Figure A1.1)—Two horizontal yellow solid lines perpendicularly
connected by pairs of solid yellow lines with “INST” on the runway side of the line. A
designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment. Found at the point where a
taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in retro-reflective yellow paint.
Activated when ILS critical areas weather minimums are reached. ILS Critical Area Hold Line
is located on Taxiway Echo 1.
Figure A1.1—Instrument Hold Line. (Painted in yellow on concrete)
Low Approach—An approach over an airport or runway following an instrument or VFR
approach, including the go around maneuver where the pilot intentionally does not make contact
with the runway.
Missed Approach—A maneuver conducted by a pilot when an instrument approach cannot be
completed to a landing. The route of flight and altitude are shown on instrument approach
procedure charts. A pilot executing a missed approach prior to a missed approach point (MAP)
must continue along the final approach to the MAP. The pilot may climb immediately to the
altitude specified in the missed approach procedure.
Option—An approach requested and conducted by a pilot that will result in a touch-and-go, low
approach, stop-and-go, full stop landing, or missed approach.
To allow maximum utilization of the runway, local aircraft cleared for the option may only
execute a touch—and-go, missed approach or low approach. Full stop or stop-and-go landings
are not authorized for local aircraft when cleared for the option.
Pilots should normally request the specific type landing rather than the option except when
necessary for training or evaluations.
Perimeter Road— A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Runway Hold line (Figure A1.2)—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway
environment. Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Figure A1.2—Runway Hold Line. (Painted in yellow on concrete)
Unsafe Gun—A situation in which an electrical or mechanical malfunction has occurred which
may result in the inadvertent firing of the mechanism.
Visual Approach—An approach wherein an aircraft on an IFR flight plan, operating in VFR
conditions.
Wet Runway—When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25 percent or more of the
runway surface area (whether in isolated areas or not), report the RSC as “wet runway” and no
RCR. Note: Regardless of a Wet or Dry RSC, report the existence, location and depth of any
standing water (ponding, water patches, puddles, etc.). Runways with historical drainage
problems may require more restrictive local procedures for reporting the RSC. The AFM or
designated representative determines and reports RSC. Regardless of who determines the RSC
Wet, the runway must be reported Wet when there is visible moisture on the predominate portion

of the useable runway and a physical check of the runway is required to determine RSC Dry.
Document all actions in the AF IMT 3616.
