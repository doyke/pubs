                     OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. General. The following standards will be observed at all times when vehicles are operating
on the airfield. Care, attention, and strict adherence to these procedures will prevent accidental
damage to aircraft and injury to personnel. The Airfield Manager (AFM) is the designated
authority for the interpretation of airfield driving standards and rules. It is expressly forbidden
for any vehicle to use the airfield area as a shortcut to any point on or off the airfield that is
accessible by roads outside the airfield environment. All airfield drivers are required to know the
location and meaning of CMAs and their associated markings and signs, whether or not the
driver will be operating in the movement areas.
3.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Operations
   3.2.1. Travis CMA is defined as the runway, overruns, and 100 feet either side of the
   runways edge (Attachment 9). The CMA is protected by Visual Flight Rule (VFR) hold
   lines. This line consists of two solid lines and two dashed yellow lines. The lines are located
   on taxiways D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L and M. In addition, hold lines are located on taxiways
   D, E, F, G, R and between runways 3L/21R and 3R and 21L (this area is known as the
   checkerboard). Extreme caution must be exercised in this area as it lies in the approach zone
   of Runway 21R. Travis has a temporary instrument hold line marking on Twy Mike. All
   VFR hold lines are coincidental with the requirements to protect the precision navigational
   aid area.
   3.2.2. All aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians must obtain permission from the control tower
   prior to operating in the CMA. Note: Permission may not be requested/granted from any
   other source. A three-way relayed message to the control tower is prohibited.
   3.2.3. All aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians operating in the CMA will monitor and maintain
   two-way communication with the control tower. Note: Only the driver of the vehicle is
   authorized to talk to the control tower for access to the CMA. It is forbidden for any other
   person in the vehicle to request this access.
   3.2.4. Vehicles and pedestrians required to operate in the CMA must have a call sign
   approved by Airfield Management, 60 OSS/OSAA, to ensure no duplication.

Note: This list contains only those ground vehicle operators who have mission essential
requirements to drive on the airfield within the CMA and communicate with the control tower on
a regular basis. It does not include operators who occasionally communicate with tower.
     3.2.5. Any vehicle requiring operations within the CMA that is not capable of two-way radio
     contact with control tower must be escorted by a properly equipped vehicle. Note: Airfield
     Management will not provide Escorts.
     3.2.6. Vehicles/personnel authorized to operate in the CMA will continuously observe the
     control tower for light gun signals in the event radio contact is lost. If the tower controller
     flashes the white runway edge lights on and off or signals with a flashing red light gun signal,
     exit the runway immediately. Note: Placards are mandatory for airfield vehicles. The
     placards serve as a quick reference guide to identify airport signs and markings. Placards can
     be obtained at Airfield Management.
     3.2.7. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge communications with the tower
     controller by reading back all information so the tower controller knows the message was
     received and understood.
     3.2.8. The vehicle operator must always give aircraft and tower controller transmission
     priority unless an emergency exists.
     3.2.9. Immediately report improper radio terminology to Airfield Management (60
     OSS/OSAA).
3.3. Airfield Access Points/Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Checks
     3.3.1. Access points to the airfield are: Building P-1 parking lot, Base Operations/Tower
     parking lot, Maintenance and AGE Parking lots, Hangar row and APS Warehouse area.
     (Attachment 7)
     3.3.2. Before entering the airfield, inspect the exterior of vehicle for loose objects, check tire
     treads and remove foreign objects to prevent possible FOD incidents. If there is excessive
     debris that cannot be immediately cleaned up, the driver will contact Airfield Management
     via the ramp net or landline 424-2836/2837 and request a sweeper.
     3.3.3. Driving off paved surfaces is prohibited, except in an emergency situation or if duty-
     related. The driver of a vehicle entering a paved surface from an unpaved surface shall check
     the vehicle tires for FOD before proceeding onto the paved surface. Any FOD removed from
     tires will be kept inside the vehicle or placed in the FOD container until it can be disposed of
     off the airfield area.
TRAVISAFBI13-103 11 AUGUST 2009                                                                     15


   3.3.4. Vehicle operators, when performing FOD checks on vehicle tires and the driver’s seat
   is vacant, will turn off the ignition, set the parking brake and close the door to perform the
   FOD check on the tires.
   3.3.5. Emergency response vehicles responding to an emergency or alert condition are
   exempt from FOD checks.
3.4. Vehicle Parking and Operations near Aircraft.
   3.4.1. Vehicles will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet in front, 200
   feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading, unloading,
   servicing or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards an aircraft.
   Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into aircraft.
   3.4.2. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they do not interfere with the aircraft being
   towed or taxied. The parking brake on all parked vehicles will be set. Ignition will be turned
   off, keys will be left in the ignition and the gear lever put in reverse for vehicles with manual
   transmissions or in the ―park‖ position for vehicles with automatic transmissions and have
   wheel chocks placed in front of and behind one of the rear wheels. For tandem wheel
   vehicles place a chock between the dual tandem axle. The only vehicles exempt from these
   requirements are emergency vehicles responding to an emergency. No vehicle will be left
   unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline.
   3.4.3. Park so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be toward any
   part of the aircraft.
   3.4.4. The driver’s side of the vehicle will be on the aircraft side.

        occurs during the hours of darkness.
        3.11.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
        ―All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
        Management, Tower and Maintenance Operations Center.‖ State the nature of the
        problem and report your position on the airfield.
     3.11.2. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (security forces, civil engineering,
     transportation, etc.) should make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off the
     airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on the parking aprons, taxiways or runway.
     3.11.3. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
     attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
     3.11.4. In the event of a disabled vehicle in the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
     notify control tower and airfield management by any means possible to coordinate
     expeditious removal of the disabled vehicle from the CMA.
        3.11.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in
        the CMA.
        3.11.4.2. The disable vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
        safest way possible.

     runway.
     3.12.2. Ground vehicle operators will not drive directly on the taxiway centerline or
     shoulders unless specifically checking the pavement condition or checking for FOD.
     Normally, the only vehicles that drive on the centerline are Airfield Management vehicles,
     follow-me vehicles and the airfield sweeper.
TRAVISAFBI13-103 11 AUGUST 2009                                                                 19


   3.12.3. Ground vehicle operators will drive on the right side of the taxiway/taxi lane
   centerline in reference to the vehicle’s direction of travel. Ground vehicle operators will give
   way to emergency vehicles by pulling to the far right of the taxiway/taxi lane. Some
   vehicles, i.e.; K-loaders, tow vehicles, maintenance tow vehicles, etc., may not be able to
   drive on the far right side due to vehicle widths and blind spots. Do not park vehicles on
   taxiways or leave vehicles unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline.
   3.12.4. Except for Follow-Me vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or driven into
   the path of taxiing aircraft. Note: Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and
   its Follow-Me vehicle.
   3.12.5. During hours of darkness, headlights of a vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft
   will be turned OFF immediately so the pilot’s night vision is not affected and the vehicle
   parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its position is known. Headlights
   will remain OFF until the aircraft is out of range and turned back on prior to putting the
   vehicle in motion. Vehicle operators with daytime running light-equipped vehicles (DRLs)
   must know the operating procedures for their vehicles (consult the owner’s manual). The
   following procedures should work for most DRL-equipped vehicles: stop the vehicle, shift
   transmission into park and apply the parking brake.
3.13. Right of Way.
   3.13.1. All vehicle drivers who operate on the taxiways or parking ramps/aprons will give
   way to taxiing and towed aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with the ground
   vehicle operators. Vehicle operators encountering an aircraft in front or behind will exit the
   taxiway by the shortest route and, if necessary, reverse course to quickly move out of the
   aircraft’s way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle be driven off prepared surfaces. This
   would be to ensure adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft.
   3.13.2. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and:
       3.13.2.1. Will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that is
       within 200 feet or until the aircraft has passed by at least 200 feet.
       3.13.2.2. Will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with its rotors in
       motion.
       3.13.2.3. Will yield the right-of-way to emergency response vehicles with rotating
       lights/flashers in motion.
       3.13.2.4. Will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already operating on a taxiway they
       wish to enter or cross.
   3.13.3. Under no circumstances will vehicles overtake another vehicle to the right while
   traveling on taxiways/taxilanes.
3.14. Routes of Travel.
   3.14.1. Passenger buses and other large vehicles are prohibited from using taxiways to travel
   the length of the airfield, with the following exceptions:
       3.14.1.1. K-loaders and passenger buses may use Taxiway L (Lima) and N (November)
       to transition to/from the mass parking area and the 900 ramp.

taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the
FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Runways, Checkerboard area (Taxiway D, E, F, G and R), any
paved surface inside a runway hold line, and any grass area inside 100 feet on either side of the
runway edge requiring tower clearance for entry.
Foreign Object Debris (FOD) —Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to an aircraft.
A few examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks, discarded parts from maintenance
activities, etc. Any of these objects can shred internal parts if ingested into a jet engine and can
become deadly projectiles. FOD can create an extremely hazardous and costly situation during
taxiing, takeoff and landing; therefore, it is imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to
FOD and remove it immediately.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs) —Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Ground Vehicle Traffic Lane—The roadway bordered by a white line, extending from Hangar
#808 to the end of the 200 ramp, connecting to the POL/Services access road.
Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
MA Complex—Maintenance Group maintenance area, including all hangars and buildings
owned by the 60 MXG.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—The roadway beginning at Line Gate 53 and circling the runway to the
southeast and ending at Line Gate 4. This area is not considered part of the airfield.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs) —A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Restricted Areas—Areas surrounded by ropes and stanchions, ropes and rubber donuts, a 4-6
inch redline on the ground, or cement ―Jersey‖ barriers. Warning signs are posted every 100 feet
TRAVISAFBI13-103 11 AUGUST 2009                                                                 31


along the boundary. Entry control points are shown with a white line with four reflectors on
each corner. The restricted areas at Travis are: the 200-600 ramps, portions of the 900 ramp and
the Navy (TACAMO) alert area. Personnel requiring entry into a restricted area must have an
Air Force security line badge issued by SFS.
Runway Intrusion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.

                          TDY AIRFIELD DRIVERS’ BRIEFING

A5.1. General. This letter reiterates policies and procedures for control of vehicle operations on
the airfield in accordance with TAFBI 13-103, Vehicle Operations on the Airfield. It authorizes
TDY personnel qualified to drive on their home station airfield, and in possession of AF IMT
483, Certificate of Competency, to operate on the TAFB’s airfield. Airfield vehicle operations
are covered in AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 25, AFOSH Standard 91-100 and TAFBI 13-103 and
must be strictly complied with. Keep this letter, a copy of the airfield diagram and a copy of
your orders with you while driving on the airfield at Travis AFB. Airfield driving privileges are
good only for the duration of the TDY and/or contract.
A5.2. Precautions. The Travis airfield is a large and busy complex. Driving on taxiways and
ramps will be kept to a minimum and in direct support of mission aircraft.
   A5.2.1. NEVER cross the runway or drive onto the runway unless specifically authorized to
   do so by the procedures outlined in TAFBI 13-103 and only with approval from the control
   tower when operating within 100 feet of the runway and controlled movement area.
   A5.2.2. Vehicle operators will do FOD checks prior to entering the airfield from an unpaved
   surface. FOD checks will be accomplished when entering or crossing any taxiway, ramp or
   runway from an access road/unpaved surface or when exiting a construction area.
   A5.2.3. Do not cross taxiways when an approaching aircraft is within 200 feet or until it has
   passed by at least 200 feet.
   A5.2.4. Always yield to taxiing aircraft and emergency response vehicles.
   A5.2.5. Vehicles stopped for aircraft holding on a taxiway will not cross the taxiway in front
   of the aircraft unless signaled to do so by the pilot.
   A5.2.6. Remain at least 100 feet from helicopters with rotors in motion.
   A5.2.7. Exercises or other priority maintenance missions are NOT an emergency. You must
   adhere to established speed limits.
   A5.2.8. Always drive on the right side of the taxiway centerline; do not drive on the
   shoulders unless you are taking emergency action to avoid an aircraft. If this happens, avoid
   driving over taxiway lights.
   A5.2.9. Do not pass a stopped or towed aircraft unless the aircrew or marshaller indicates
   that you may proceed. Maintain at least 30 feet lateral clearance.
   A5.2.10. If you encounter an aircraft coming towards you, do one of the following:
       A5.2.10.1. Turn around and exit the taxiway at the next paved surface.
       A5.2.10.2. As a last resort, drive into a grassy area and maintain at least a 30-foot
       wingtip clearance for the aircraft to pass. However, before driving onto the paved surface
       again you must check the tires for FOD.
A5.3. Speed Limits.
   A5.3.1. Close proximity (within 25 ft) of aircraft – 5 MPH

     A5.3.2. Special purpose or vehicles towing equipment – 10 MPH
     A5.3.3. Taxiways, ramp areas, general purpose vehicles – 15 MPH or as posted
A5.4. Parking.
     A5.4.1. Never leave a vehicle unattended on a taxiway.
     A5.4.2. Do not park closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft (300
     ft for C-5 or B-747) when engines are running or about to start.
     A5.4.3. All vehicles parked and left unattended on the airfield will have the ignition turned
     off. Keys will remain in the vehicle and the door will be unlocked.
     A5.4.4. Place the vehicle in park for vehicles with automatic transmissions or reverse for
     vehicles with manual transmissions.
     A5.4.5. Set the foot/hand brake or chock the front and rear of one of the drive wheels. Do
     not point the vehicle in a manner that it would roll towards any aircraft or impede other
     aircraft and/or vehicle traffic.
A5.5. Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Prevention. A FOD potential exists at all airports. If you
see debris on or near the airfield you must remove it. If the debris is too much for you to pick up
yourself, call airfield management at 424-2836/2836 and request a sweeper.
A5.6. Night Driving. During darkness (sunset to sunrise), vehicle operators will not shine their
headlights toward oncoming aircraft. Pull over to the side, turn off the headlights and turn on the
vehicle parking lights.
A5.7. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Procedures. The controlled movement area is
protected by Visual Flight Rule (VFR) hold lines. VFR hold lines are located on taxiways D, E,
F, G, H, I, J, K, L and M. Hold lines are also located within the area known as the checkerboard
(the area between runways 21R/3L and 21L/3R consisting of taxiways D, E, F, G and R). VFR
hold lines consist of four lines, two solid yellow and two dashed yellow lines, extending across
the width of the taxiway (including the shoulders) 100 feet from the runway edge. All aircraft,
vehicles and pedestrians MUST stop at the solid lines which are located on the taxiway side
(before you cross the runway). Only vehicles/pedestrians possessing direct two-way radio
contact with the control tower are permitted in the CMA. Ground vehicle operators/pedestrians
must FIRST get permission from the control tower prior to entering or crossing the CMA.
Access to the CMA is not granted if a person is identified as being color blind. All
vehicles/pedestrians operating in the CMA must have a call sign.
     A5.7.1. Come to a complete stop at the runway hold line.
     A5.7.2. Inform the tower of your location and of your intentions.
     A5.7.3. Repeat the tower’s instructions verbatim and then comply with those instructions.
     A5.7.4. Advise the tower when you have departed the CMA.
A5.8. Contractors.
     A5.8.1. Contractor personnel will follow a designated route to the work/project site as
     identified by the airfield manager and/or designated representative.
TRAVISAFBI13-103 11 AUGUST 2009                                                            39
