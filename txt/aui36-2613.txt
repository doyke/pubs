SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
further defines and clarifies responsibilites for the AFIT Civilian Institution Programs (CIP)
office, the Air Force Research Institute (AFRI), who manages the Air Force Fellows, the School
 2                                                                  AUI36-2613 22 MAY 2012


of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), and AFROTC detachments in the support of AFIT
students attending AFIT CI programs, Air Force Fellows attending fellows programs, and
SAASS personnel in the Lorenz Fellowship program. Responsibilities for the AFIT CIP Liaison
Officer (LO) have been expanded and an AFIT CIP student responsibility section has been
added.
1. Policy. The goal of all parties to this instruction is to provide effective and efficient
management of geographically separated students where practical with minimal impact on
external organizations. Many CI students and some Air Force and SAASS Fellows attend
universities where there is an AFROTC Detachment co-located or where there is an AFROTC
detachment in reasonable proximity. In these locations, it is practical to look to AFROTC
detachments to assist in providing administrative support to AFIT students and Air Force
Fellows within their geographic region. Servicing base FSS/MPSs will also desire to “attach”
AFIT CIP students to the nearest AFROTC Detachment for administrative purposes.
2. Definitions and Terms: See Attachment 1 for a listing of definitions and terms used in this
publication.
3. AFIT CIP Office, AFRI and SAASS Responsibilities. The AFIT CIP Office is responsible
for all actions listed below pertaining to AFIT CIP students. AFRI is responsible for all actions
pertaining to AF and SAASS Fellows. For its respective group, the AFIT CIP Office and AFRI
will:
     3.1. Coordinate all Commander and UCMJ matters pertaining to AFIT CIP students through
     the AFIT Chain of Command or the Air University chain of command for AF and SAASS
     Fellows.
     3.2. Monitor the effectiveness of support to AFIT CIP students and AF and SAASS Fellows.
     3.3. Administer academic programs for AFIT CIP students and AF and SAASS Fellows.
     3.4. Implement student disenrollment procedures in accordance with AUI 36-2315, Student
     Disenrollment Procedures. The AU/CC is the final decision authority for all misconduct
     disenrollment cases. Medical students will be disenrolled IAW AFI 41-117, Medical Service
     Officer Education.
     3.5. Develop, with HQ AFROTC, procedural guidance for support of designated AFIT CIP
     students and AF and SAASS Fellows.
     3.6. Maintain accountability and duty status for AFIT CIP students and AF and SAASS
     Fellows as directed. Appropriate methods of accountability include use of the Air Force
     Personnel Accountability and Assessment System (AFPAAS) and may require individual
     student telephone and email contact.
     3.7. Accomplish training reports on AFIT CIP active-duty students and AF and SAASS
     Fellows.
     3.8. Require AFIT CIP students and AF and SAASS Fellows to report to assigned AFROTC
     Detachment upon arrival on campus.
     3.9. Notify AFROTC Det/CCs of those AFIT CIP students and AF and SAASS Fellows

     to Detachments with assigned AFIT CI students and to the LO of future student gains and
     losses as they occur.
     3.9.2. AFRI and SAASS notification procedures. During the first week in July each
     year, AFRI and SAASS will send a proposed student attachment roster by email to the
     AFROTC Detachment. Not later than 15 August, AFROTC Det/CCs will notify AFRI
     and/or SAASS by e-mail that they accept the roster.

  LOs will submit their ordinary leave requests to AFIT CIP. All students are responsible for
  making sure they have a current LeaveWeb account and sending all approved CONL, OSL,

  assignment of a leave authorization number (LAN). AFRI/SAASS will manage all
  leave/PTDY requests for AF/SAASS Fellows, as applicable.
  3.14.1. AFIT CIP will receive and approve requests for ordinary leave only when the AFIT
  LO is not available or when one is not assigned. AFIT CIP will give students a copy of the

     activities approval process is outline below:
         6.6.1.1. Member informs supervisor of their intent to participate in high-risk
         activities. Student “supervisor” is considered the LO. If there is no LO or member is
         the LO, the AFROTC Det/CC can serve as supervisor.
         6.6.1.2. Member makes an appointment to meet with their supervisor to discuss high-
         risk activities and gain approval on AETC Form 410.
         6.6.1.3. Prior to each event thereafter, member informs supervisor where/when they
         will be participating in the high-risk activity.
         6.6.1.4. High-Risk Activity Examples (not all inclusive): ATVs, auto racing; hot air
