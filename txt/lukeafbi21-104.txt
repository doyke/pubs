This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It establishes SERENE
BYTE and PACER WARE procedures in conjunction with AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare
Integrated Reprogramming, for the 56th Fighter Wing (FW). Commanders, maintenance
officers, and staff agencies will ensure compliance with this instruction. It applies to all
maintenance and operations personnel assigned to the 56th Maintenance Group (56 MXG) and
the 56th Operations Group (OG). It replaces 56 FW OI 21-3, SERENE BYTE/PACER WARE
Procedures. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.

1. SERENE BYTE/PACER WARE (SB/PW) Procedures:

1.1. A SERENE BYTE is a training exercise used to evaluate communications from
headquarters down through field level agencies and test the capability of the wing to update
electronic warfare (EW) equipment settings and modify EW system software. A PACER WARE
is an actual update to wing EW equipment settings and modification of EW system software.

1.2. Each aircraft maintenance unit (AMU) and avionics intermediate shop (AIS) will establish
an account, via the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), STU-III/SDD/STE,
with the Multi-service Electronic Warfare Data Distribution System (MSEWDDS) in order to
gain assess to EW system software changes, System Impact Messages (SIM), Reprogramming
Impact Messages (RIM), Maintenance Instruction Messages (MIM), Time Compliance
Technical Orders (TCTO), and Implementation Messages (IMP). If the SIPRNET is
unavailable, the STU-III/SDD/STE will be utilized to obtain required reprogramming data. This
will also serve as an optional means of obtaining data in the event that deployed aircraft require
reprogramming. These procedures apply to home station and deployed aircraft. The
MSEWDDS users guide is available at: https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/milweb/msewdds/.

2. SB/PW Reprogramming Requirements:

2.1. The SB/PW process normally starts with the arrival of a SERENE BYTE or PACER
WARE message via the MSEWDDS account on the SIPRNET. However, SB/PW messages
may also arrive at the 56 FW Command Post for distribution. During non-duty hours, the
Command Post will first contact the 56th Fighter Wing Entry Control Point (56 FW ECP) for
message processing. If the 56 FW ECP is unavailable, the Command Post will contact the next
person on the SB/PW message pick-up authorization letter. The contacted individual will then
assume event coordinator responsibilities.

2.2. The normal flow and definition of messages for a SB/PW is as follows:

2.2.1. An initial message may alert the wing of an impending SB/PW event, or it could be no-
notice with a SIM arriving first. The SIM describes parametric changes to threats and details
what effect the changes will have on a particular aircraft EW system.

2.2.2. A RIM may follow the SIM. The RIM details how the Reprogramming Center plans to
compensate for the change in the threat and how the reprogramming actions affect the system. A
TCTO or MIM may also arrive that defines the reprogramming procedures for maintenance
personnel.

2.2.3. Along with or immediately after the RIM, the data (reprogramming software) will become
available on the MSEWDDS. Once maintenance units are notified, they should download the
appropriate software. EDNA equipment may be loaded with the new software at that time.
However, reprogramming will not commence until the IMP message arrives and the 56 OG/CC
approves the reprogramming. 56 OG/CC approval will be disseminated by the event
coordinator.

2.2.4. The IMP is the authorization from HQ AETC to reprogram the affected systems.
However, prior to reprogramming any 56 FW EW system, the event coordinator will brief the
56 OG/CC on the effect of the SB/PW. EW systems will not be reprogrammed without approval
from the 56 OG/CC. In addition, the event coordinator will notify the appropriate fighter
squadron commanders and operations officers concerning the effect of the SB/PW.
LUKEAFBI21-104 17 APRIL 2009                                                                     3

2.2.5. The interval between messages can vary from a few hours, as in a SERENE BYTE
exercise, to several months for a PACER WARE dealing with a routine software upgrade.

2.3. IAW AFI 10-703, when HQ ACC or JFACC/CFACC/AOC directs units to load software
reprogramming changes to CC (combat) coded aircraft with wing commander (or designated
representative) approval, units will schedule and upload software changes on TF (training) and
CB (test) coded aircraft as soon as possible, on a non-interference basis with programmed
training and testing. Use the following criteria when performing reprogramming actions on CC
coded aircraft:

2.3.1. ROUTINE. Treat reprogramming actions as normal day-to-day operations. Flying units
may schedule around the daily training/maintenance schedule. NOTE: A not later than date
(NLT) for completion may be given by the implementation authority.

2.3.2. IMMEDIATE. Treat as an emergency reprogramming action. Immediately perform
reprogramming actions as required by the reprogramming message. Flying unit commanders
may determine if training or operational missions can or cannot be flown without reprogramming
actions being performed. NOTE: During all exercises, MAJCOM/IG timelines are used to
determine flying units success in meeting IMMEDIATE timeliness.

2.4. Reprogramming efforts (successful or not) will be reported to the 56 FW ECP. Successful
reprogramming of the first aircraft will be reported immediately upon completion.
Reprogramming of remaining aircraft will be reported not later than 24 hours after
reprogramming is completed. The report will be in memorandum format and will list:

2.4.1. SB/PW start time.

2.4.2. Aircraft reprogrammed by tail number.

2.4.3. Time reprogramming completed for each aircraft.

2.5. The 56 FW ECP will use the compiled data following a SB/PW to generate the Unit
Loading Message (ULM). For a PACER WARE, the ULM should be generated when the
readily available aircraft are reprogrammed. A statement will be included in the ULM
explaining why the remaining units were not reprogrammed and when the reprogramming is
projected to be complete. For a SERENE BYTE, the ULM will be generated when the required
number of EW systems are reprogrammed.

3. Responsibilities:

3.1. 56 FW ECP (56 OSS/OSKE) will:

3.1.1. Provide the Command Post with a message pick-up authorization letter listing names and
phone numbers (home and duty) of key 56 FW personnel to notify upon receipt of SB/PW
message (during non-duty hours).
3.1.2. Upon receipt of SB/PW message, notify the wing avionics manager (WAM) at ext.
4                                                          LUKEAFBI21-104 17 APRIL 2009

6-3610. Also determine what agencies, if any, are required to take action. Designate a lead unit
to begin reprogramming and instruct the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) to notify all
other affected organizations.

procedures run smoothly.

3.1.4. Prepare after action reports (ULM) for all SB/PW.

3.1.5. Conduct semiannual training with each organization and perform walk through training to
answer any questions that might lead to confusion during SB/PW employment.

(during non-duty hours).

3.3.2. Ensure that a SB/PW Message Pick-up Authorization letter is maintained on file.

3.4. 56 FW WAM will:

3.4.1. Be focal point for 56 MXG in all SB/PW issues.

3.4.2. Coordinate between ECP, AMUs, AIS and MOC on all SB/PW issues and events.

3.4.3. Have access to SIPRNET for access to MSEWDDS. Access to MSEWDDS must be
submitted through website manager. Application and procedures will be kept on file in program
