This publication extends guidance from Air Force Instruction (AFI) 31-401, Information Security
Program Management. This instruction describes responsibilities, policies and procedures for
using the Vandenberg Air Force Central Destruction Facility (CDF) located in Building 7423 to
destroy classified and sensitive materials. Types of records media that are officially destroyed in
the CDF are: paper, CD ROMs, DVDs, floppy disk, microfiche, laminates, transparencies, audio
and videocassette tapes and typewriter ribbons. All tapes and ribbons must be completely
removed from casings and unwound before actual destruction. Base Records Management (30
SCS/SCXPR) personnel will provide training and instructions for use of the destruction
equipment. This instruction applies to all 30th Space Wing and subordinate units assigned or
attached to Vandenberg AFB. Send comments and suggestions for this instruction on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, 30 SCS/SCQ, 867 Washington Ave, Ste 205,
VAFB CA 93437-6120. Ensure that all records created as a result of the processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
IAW      the     Air    Force     Records     Disposition    Schedule     (RDS)       located    at

     cutting blades.
     4.4. Do not look into the media flap while the DSC 500X Data Destroyer is running as the
     flap prevents small fractions of material from flying out of the machine and possibly injuring
     the user.

Terms
Classified—Official information that has been determined to require, in the interests of national
security, protection against unauthorized disclosure and which has been so designated.
Secret—With respect to classified matter, the condition that prevents unauthorized persons from
having access to official information that is safeguarded in the interests of national security.
Top Secret—A category to which national security information and material is assigned to
denote the degree of damage that unauthorized disclosure would cause to national defense or
foreign relations of the United States and to denote the degree of protection required. There are
three such categories. a. top secret--National security information or material that requires the
highest degree of protection and the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. Examples of
"exceptionally grave damage" include armed hostilities against the United States or its allies;
disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national security; the compromise of vital
national defense plans or complex cryptologic and communications intelligence systems; the
revelation of sensitive intelligence operations; and the disclosure of scientific or technological
developments vital to national security. b. secret--National security information or material that
requires a substantial degree of protection and the unauthorized disclosure of which could
reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. Examples of "serious
damage" include disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security;
significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security; revelation
of significant military plans or intelligence operations; and compromise of significant scientific
or technological developments relating to national security. c. confidential--National security
information or material that requires protection and the unauthorized disclosure of which could
reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.

A2.1. Laminates and Transparencies. Laminates and transparencies must be destroyed with
paper to facilitate the cutting process. Too little paper will cause the blades to overheat and melt
the plastic instead of cutting it. This will result in jams, unnecessary wear on the blades and
could cause a fire.

Table A2.1. Table of Material to Paper Ratio.
 Material                 Paper Ratio
 Paper                    NA
 Laminate                 3:1
 Transparencies           3:1
 Typewriter Ribbons       4:1
 Tapes                    4:1
A2.2. Fastening Devices. All fastening devices must be removed (i.e., paper clips, staples,
fasteners, screw posts, etc.) to prevent chipping of the blades.
