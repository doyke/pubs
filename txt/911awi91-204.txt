2. General Safety Requirements.
2.1. Explosives will be handled, transported, and used only by personnel trained in the task to be
performed.
2.2. Explosives will not be tumbled, thrown, dropped, or handled in a rough manner unless
designed to do so.
2.3. No attempt will be made to disassemble, modify, or alter explosive items. Explosive items
will not be use in a manner other than their intended purpose.
2.4. If abnormal conditions relating to the safe configuration of an explosive item are noted, no
attempt will be made to use the explosive or correct the condition. Notify the 911 AW
Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and the
Safety Office for assistance as needed.
2.5. Explosive items will be stored and transported in their approved storage and shipping
container.
2.6 Only the quantity of munitions necessary for a specific operation will be drawn from
storage. This will be identified in the exercise plan in accordance with section 3.
2.7. A pre-exercise safety briefing will be conducted for all personnel before deployment to the
exercise site. Exercise plans developed in accordance with section 3 will identify specific times,
locations, and briefer. The briefing must include items in Attachment 4 as a minimum.
2.8. A suitable number, normally two 2A:10BC, of appropriate fire extinguishers will be
available in areas where grenades, simulators, and flares are used.
2.9. In the event of an emergency, the exercise scenario will be stopped, supervisory personnel
will be notified of the emergency, all weapons will be safed, and personnel will await
instructions from appropriate supervisory personnel. Supervisory personnel must be
knowledgeable of all emergency procedures and notification requirements.
2.10. No Smoking within 50 feet of explosives.
2.11. If it is necessary to have personnel armed with live ammunition in the exercise area they
will be readily identifiable. (e.g. red tape, white hat, reflective vest, arm band) They will wear
some sort of reflective gear during the hours of darkness. Live ammunition will be kept separate,
secured and clearly marked from blank ammunitions at all times. These armed personnel will not
participate in the exercise and be responsible for control of their live ammunition.
2.12. Do Not Enter Explosive Operations / Exercise in Progress signs will be posted at all
approach avenues not manned by an entry controller. The purpose is to keep unauthorized
personnel from entering an exercise area without proper escort.
3. Planning.
3.1. An exercise plan will be developed before each exercise (preferably 30 days) by the Office
of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The plan will be signed by the OPR, coordinated with each
Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), the base Fire Chief, Munitions Management,
Environmental Health, Base Environmental and the Wing Weapon Safety Office. The plan
format outlined in attachment 2 can be used for this purpose. The installation commander or his
designated representative (at the base where the exercise will take place) must approve the plan.
Other formats may be used, provided all information in attachment 2 is included.
3.2. Exercise plans will be prepared by the exercise OPR. The OPR and the Wing Weapon
Safety Manager will maintain a copy.
3.3. When accomplishing the exercise plan, compile a detailed list of explosives and weapons
authorized for use in the exercise. Locations where munitions will be deployed will be included.
3.4. Include base Safety Office personnel in the training and exercise planning.
911AWI91-204 8 OCTOBER 2008                                                                   3


3.5 Section Commander approved lesson plans will be developed and coordinated through the
Wing Weapons Safety office prior to explosive training classes.
4. Requisition of Munitions.
4.1. Once munitions requirements are identified, the OPR will coordinate through the 911 Airlift
Wing Munitions Management to ensure training munitions are available. The specific
munitions, persons authorized or designated to draw munitions, and the scheduled pickup
date/time will be included in the exercise plan in accordance with section 3. A signed AF IMT
483 Certificate of Competency to deploy exercise munitions will be presented to Munitions
personnel prior to munitions pickup.
5. Munitions Accounting and Control.
5.1. Explosive training items, although normally containing comparatively small amounts of
explosive material can be extremely hazardous if not properly handled and used. Stringent
control and accountability are essential to ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands or are
used in an unauthorized manner. Experience has shown those items inadvertently left on training
range/exercise areas or taken to quarters and used for pranks or experimentation can result in
serious mishaps.
5.2. Accurate recording of munitions issued and expended by individuals will be accomplished
as follows:
5.2.1. Munitions Issue/Turn-in Log. The individual designated to draw the munitions will make
a physical inventory before departing the pickup point. The munitions custodian should use an
AF IMT 3126, General Purpose Form, or a locally designed form to record issue of munitions
by lot number, to individuals at the range/exercise site. The quantity expended and turned in will
be recorded at the termination of the exercise. Inventories will be conducted at each shift change.
Discrepancies in accountability will be resolved before departing the range/exercise area. If an
out of balance count of munitions occurs the exercise will be called to a halt until the out of
balance count is corrected.
5.2.2. A 100% inspection of all blank rounds used during exercises will be completed to verify
that they are in fact, all blank rounds. A disinterested official appointed by the exercise team
chief will assist in this inspection. The base MASO will complete a 100% inventory on all live
(projectile) ammunition that could be substituted for blanks to assure there are no out of balance
conditions prior to the exercise.
5.2.3. Only trained and qualified personnel are allowed to issue ammunition. The ability to
discern between a live round with a projectile and a blank round is a requirement to be qualified
to issue ammunition during exercises. The ability to identify an unserviceable round and control
the inventory is also a requirement to be qualified. The exercise team chief identifies these
qualified individuals on the exercise plan.
5.2.4. Training munitions will be stored in original containers in the munitions storage area
when not in use. Temporary storage at other location can be arranged through the use of an AF
IMT 2047 coordinated through the base Safety Office.
6. Training for Simulators and Smoke Producing Munitions.
6.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring all personnel who handle, transport, or use
simulators and smoke producing munitions are properly trained.
6.2. The following applies to the use of these devices during exercises and training:
6.2.1. Only US Air Force stock listed items are authorized for use.
6.2.2. Only trained personnel can prepare and activate these devices. Explosives Ordnance
Disposal (EOD) or EOD trained trainers will provide training on an annual basis to personnel
911AWI91-204 8 OCTOBER 2008                                                                 4


whose duties require them to initiate training simulators or smoke producing munitions. It is the
responsibility of the user organization to request training and maintain training documentation.
Any of the following may be used for documentation; AF IMT 483, AF IMT 623, On-the-Job
Training Record, or a Certificate of Training.
6.2.3. Personnel requiring training to activate simulators and smoke producing munitions will
call the Wing Safety Office or the closest available EOD office to schedule training. On the day
of training, personnel will report to EOD/Safety with a completed AF IMT 483. A certificate
number will be assigned to the Certificate of Competency card by EOD after successfully
completing the training. The trainer will also sign the front of the AF IMT 483 to show card
holder has completed the required training. Personnel who will train other personnel to activate
simulators and smoke producing munitions must attend training which will consist of 4 hours of
classroom instruction, a written test and be qualified to handle, maintain and inspect the
simulators and smoke producing munitions. All explosive training will follow the guidelines in
this regulation.
6.2.4. Units requesting training will provide one of each munitions item per student and one per
instructor for training.
6.2.5. Smoke from grenades may be toxic in high concentrations. These items, along with
simulators and flares present a fire hazard. Remove combustible materials before functioning.
Consider winds and fire hazards such as dry grass or fire bans. Consider using a barrier to
control spread of heat during functioning of grenades. Gas mask will be readily available where
smoke grenades are being deployed.
6.2.6. Ground burst simulators or hand grenade simulators present a blast hazard. Exercise
caution around people, facilities, and equipment. Clear the area of debris that could become
projectiles from the blast. Monitor for proper functioning and disposal of residue. Notify EOD
when a munitions malfunctions. Wear proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
6.2.7. Smoke grenades and training simulators will be carried in metal ammo cans with a
closable lid during exercises. Containers will be labeled with applicable hazard class Department
of Transportation (DOT) label. Transport in accordance with applicable DOT regulations and
USAF technical data and use attached step by step procedures. Munitions will not be left
unattended.
7. Minimum distances for explosive simulators.
7.1. Prior to functioning any simulator or smoke producing explosives device, clear all
combustible material a minimum of 10 feet. It is recommended that any simulators be detonated
in a hole surrounded by sandbags. Do not use any barrier material that would produce projectiles
when simulator is detonated.
7.2. Personnel or vehicle: Maintain a minimum of 125 feet separation. Personnel who initiate
these munitions may be closer than 125 feet, but they should be as close to 125 feet away as
possible and have their back to the munitions at detonation.
7.3. Facilities without facing window: Maintain a minimum separation of 100 feet.
7.4. Facilities with facing window: Maintain a separation of 200 feet.
7.5. Bulk petroleum, oil, and lubricant storage: Maintain a minimum separation of 200 feet.
7.6. Aircraft in the open: Maintain a minimum separation of 100 feet or 200 feet if aircraft are
explosives loaded.
