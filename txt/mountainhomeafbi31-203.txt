SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Change include substantive additions, specifically paragraphs 3.-4., which create a Juvenile
Misconduct Board.


1. Curfew.
     1.1. All dependents and visitors under the age of 18 are subject to a curfew while on
     MHAFB. Curfew hours are midnight to 0500 daily.
     1.2. If security forces (SF) personnel come in contact with an unsupervised juvenile after
     curfew, SF will ascertain the juvenile’s status by conducting a field interview.
     1.3. If the juvenile has a valid, verifiable reason for being out (e.g., returning from a base
     function, friend’s home, work, etc.) during the hours of curfew, the juvenile will be allowed
     to proceed.
     1.4. Juveniles who do not have a valid need to be out or are found loitering after curfew will
     be escorted to their sponsors’ place of residence, or their sponsor contacted to pick them up
     from the scene or at the law enforcement desk (LED).
     1.5. In most cases, Field Interview Cards will be completed and filed for 90 days. These
     Field Interview Cards provide a means to track police contact with juveniles.
2. Child Supervision.
     2.1. Responsibilities. The safety of children in our military community is a shared
     responsibility.
        2.1.1. The 366th Fighter Wing Commander (366 FW/CC) is responsible for setting fair
        and appropriate standards. 366 FW/CC delegates oversight of this program to the 366th
        Mission Support Group Commander (366 MSG/CC).
        2.1.2. The 366th Medical Group (366 MDG) is responsible for providing health and
        developmental advice and counseling.
        2.1.3. Installation law enforcement organizations (the 366th Security Forces Squadron
        (366 SFS) and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) are responsible for
        fair enforcement of directives and helping to provide a safe living environment.
        2.1.4. Most importantly, caregivers must provide an appropriate level of supervision
        based on the developmental level of the child. Lack of appropriate supervision by a
        parent or guardian presents a risk of injury or harm to the child.
     2.2. Based on standard child development models, the guidance in this paragraph provides a
     baseline for child supervision on MHAFB. However, each parent, guardian, or caregiver
     must assess the individual developmental level of each child and make the final decision as
     to what is right for that child. The minimum standards are described below:
        2.2.1. Children not yet attending Kindergarten (or equivalent) will be "in the line of
        sight" of a responsible parent, guardian, or caregiver at all times unless the child is in a
        safe controlled environment such as a fully fenced-in backyard.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI31-203 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            3


       2.2.2. Children of Kindergarten age through 8 years of age, may at the discretion of their
       parents, guardian, or caregivers, be out of the line of sight for short periods of time or for
       short distances such as a walk to a neighbor's residence or a short walk/bike ride to and
       from school.
       2.2.3. Children 9 to 13 years of age are often capable of supervising themselves;
       however, developmentally they have a difficult time predicting the consequences of their
       actions. As such, they should not be left unsupervised for excessive periods of time, and
       never more than 12 hours.
       2.2.4. Children 14 to 18 years of age usually can manage on their own with support from
       adult neighbors or relatives for longer periods of time. However, even at this age,
       prolonged lack of adult supervision is inappropriate.
       2.2.5. Children who meet the criteria for the Exceptional Family Member Program
       (EFMP) require supervision IAW their special needs regardless of their age.
   2.3. Parents, guardians, and caregivers must remember they are responsible for, and will be
   held accountable for, the conduct and well-being of their children on base. Despite the
   latitude given to parents to determine what is appropriate for their children, parents must
   ensure they stay within the bounds of what ethically, medically, and legally would be
   considered "reasonable and prudent."        Refer to Attachment 2, Sample Welcome
   Memorandum to Newcomers, from 366 SFS/CC for parents and guardians.
3. Juvenile Misconduct Board (JMB). The installation commander (366 FW/CC) is
responsible for taking reasonably necessary and lawful measures to maintain law and order on an
installation. This includes considering the appropriate disposition when there has been a
violation of federal law, including assimilated state criminal law, or applicable Air Force
Instructions (AFI) before referring the offender for trial before a US magistrate judge, as directed
by AFI 51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by Civilians.
To achieve this, 366 FW/CC hereby delegates 366 MSG/CC the authority to take all command
actions in juvenile misconduct cases, except barment, termination of government quarters or as
otherwise provided by federal statutes or regulations in regards to Department of Defense
civilian employees.
   3.1. Jurisdiction. The JMB applies to all juveniles who commit criminal offenses on
   MHAFB, including military family housing areas and ranges utilized by MHAFB. This
   includes, but is not limited to dependents that reside on MHAFB, guests of MHAFB
   residents, and all sponsored civilians who enter the installation.
   3.2. Purpose. The JMB is not a judicial proceeding. It is an administrative forum under the
   authority of 366 FW/CC. The JMB recommends actions to 366 MSG/CC, who ensures that
   the misconduct of civilians does not disrupt the good order, morale and discipline on
   MHAFB. The JMB is designed to promote personal acceptance of responsibilities and
   consequences for actions, and to deter and prevent future misconduct through behavior
   modification. The JMB will hear the facts of alleged incidents of juvenile misconduct, make
   findings of fact, and recommend appropriate punishment.
   3.3. Responsibilities.

        3.3.3.1. Is the program administrator for JMB cases.

       After weighing the evidence, 366 MSG/CC will call for a vote among the other board
       members. The other members will vote on whether the juvenile committed the
       alleged misconduct. If, by a majority, they find that the juvenile committed the
       misconduct, they will vote on appropriate action and memorialize their decisions via

           that the juvenile shall be barred from the installation upon a determination that the
           juvenile poses a threat or has disrupted good order and discipline on the installation.
           Alternatively, 366 MSG/CC may recommend that the juvenile be removed from
           government quarters upon that same determination.
           3.6.1.2. 366 MSG/CC may, upon advice of 366 FW/JA, revoke other privileges the
