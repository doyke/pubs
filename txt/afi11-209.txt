                                                 Chapter 1

                                         GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General Guidance. This instruction governs the performance of USAF aviation support for military
or public events held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. It details the procedures for event
and participation approval and specifies the operational limitations of the aviation support rendered. Air
Force aerial events keep the public and military informed of U.S. preparedness, demonstrate modern
weapons systems, promote good community and international relations, support Air Force recruiting and
retention efforts and render military honors. For additional guidance on Air Force participation in public
events and community relations programs, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. For
additional guidance on Air Force flyovers supporting funeral or memorial events, see AFI 34-242, Mortu-
ary Affairs Program. HQ USAF/A3O may task MAJCOMs to provide assets to participate in certain key
public or military events.

1.2. Public Event. Public events are community relations events not connected with the military func-
tioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military audiences. Some examples
include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions, athletic contests, parades, tat-
toos, fairs, airshows, international airshow and trade exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may
be on- or off-base; continental United States (CONUS) or outside of the continental United States (OCO-
NUS). Public events can be sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Such events can be good
community relations and recruiting opportunities. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or opera-
tions are not considered public events merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the general
public.

1.3. Military Event. A military event is an official DoD event, sponsored by the DoD, a DoD Compo-
nent, or a command conducted in support of an assigned mission, including purposes of esprit de corps,
primarily for military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents, and limited guests. The event must
be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. In the event a judgment needs to be made
on whether an event is a military or public event, contact SAF/PAN who will assist in the determination.

1.4. Aviation support (For Public and Military Events). Aviation support for public and military
events include static displays, flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial demonstrations – these activities are also
referred to as aerial events.
    1.4.1. Static Display. Static display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of military
    aircraft and related equipment not involving taxiing or starting of engines while spectators are in the
    display area.
    1.4.2. Flyover. Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight by a single military
    aircraft or by a formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the same type (see Attachment 1 for
    definition of type) from the same Military Service over a predetermined point on the ground at a spe-
    cific time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations; however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees
    are permissible and may be used if required to improve the visibility of the aircraft to the spectators.
    A single event will be supported with a single flyover only (IAW DoDD 5410.18)—this restriction
    does not apply to public airshows or to military open house events. For multiple flyovers and multiple
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                       5


   passes, see Attachment 1. Flyovers of public events in support of community relations activities may
   only be flown as adjuncts to approved training missions.
       1.4.2.1. An approved funeral or memorial service may be supported with the missing man forma-
       tion (see paragraph 3.6.2.4. and 4.2.3.).
       1.4.2.2. Dissimilar Formation Flyover. A dissimilar formation is a single-element formation of
       four or fewer aircraft of multiple Mission Design Series (MDS) of the same type (see Attachment
       1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service. A dissimilar formation flyover is not to be
       confused with an aerial review. An example of a dissimilar formation would be a two-, three-, or
       four-ship formation involving F-16s and F-15s. Formations involving variants of an MDS, for
       example a formation of F-16A, F-16C, F-16D fighters, is not considered dissimilar. A dissimilar
       formation flyover should be undertaken only with applicable consideration given to safety, to the
       compatible flying characteristics of the aircraft involved, and to the overall theme of the event that
       is being supported.
   1.4.3. Aerial Review. Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four air-
   craft, or of multiple types (see Attachment 1 for definition) of aircraft, or of aircraft representing
   more than one Military Service or Nation, regardless of horizontal and timing separation of flying ele-
   ments. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve precision maneuvers or demon-
   strations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft, formations, or a combination of
   individual aircraft and formations.
       1.4.3.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful national or international occa-
       sions and shall not be performed at CONUS public events without approval by OASD/PA. OCO-
       NUS approval will comply with COCOM directives.
       1.4.3.2. Multiple Aerial Events Supporting a Single Public Event. From the public affairs per-
       spective an aerial review flown for a given event constitutes a significant AF statement of support;
       so too does performing multiple aerial events in combination for a single public event. To ensure
       an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval, the performing of multiple aerial events (for exam-
       ple, multiple flyovers) in combination for a single public event requires event and participation
       approval levels comparable to aerial review approval levels. This criterion applies to the follow-
       ing:
          1.4.3.2.1. Multiple flyovers at the same event, regardless of timing separation between the fly-
          over aircraft or formations.
          1.4.3.2.2. The combination of an Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) airdrop and a flyover at a
          single event.
NOTE: As distinctly diverse assets, this combination will not be performed at public events without
approval by SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O.
       1.4.3.3. The definition of aerial review does not apply to the Air Force vintage aircraft program
       (Heritage/Texan Flights), unless flown in conjunction with other assets outside of the vintage air-
       craft program.
   1.4.4. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually
   every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or military events
   (except aerial review and flyover). See Attachment 1 for a list of example activities that meet the def-
   inition of Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is synonymous with the phrases aerial demo,
6                                                                                 AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


    aircraft demonstration (demo), aircraft capabilities demonstration (demo), and aircraft capabilities
    exercise (CAPEX). The AFI 11-246, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, series specify policy for
    aerial demonstrations (to include demonstration teams), demonstration profiles for certain aircraft and
    the procedures for non-standard profile approval. Training events incidentally observed by the general
    public are not considered to be aerial demonstrations. See paragraphs 3.6.4. and 4.4. for specific pro-
    cedures on aerial demonstration approval.
NOTE: Guidance in paragraphs 1.4.1. through 1.4.4. is not intended to limit aviation support at public
airshows or military Open House events – these events may be supported with multiple static displays,
multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial demonstrations, all approved IAW the normal
procedures in this instruction for event and participation approval. Additionally, multiple aerial events
supporting two or more separate events at a single geographic location in a single day can be authorized
IAW the normal procedures in this instruction (for example: a flyover for a USAFA graduation ceremony
and a funeral flyover at the USAFA cemetery, both at approximately the same time). Each event must
stand on its own, and be completely independent (limitations specified in paragraph 1.4.2. apply to each
separate event).

1.5. Approvals. Aviation support at public and military events requires both a determination of event
approval from Public Affairs and participation approval from Operations. This instruction outlines the
required levels of approval (event and participation) for aerial events at public or military events. For
some events, eligibility has been predetermined by Public Affairs and requires only Operations participa-
tion approval; see Chapter 3 for specific event approval requirements and Chapter 4 for specific partic-
ipation approval requirements. USAF aviation support not described in this instruction but planned for a
public or military event must receive MAJCOM, HQ USAF/A3O, and SAF/PA approval before the per-
formance. For events outside of the United States, Canada and Mexico, approval will comply with
COCOM directives and paragraphs 5.9. through 5.10..

1.6. Operational Criteria. Safety must be the prime consideration at all times. Do not engage in activi-
ties that compromise the safety of spectators or that could damage or destroy property. Participation by
any air refueling aircraft in a flyover or aerial review shall not be conducted with the receiver closer than
the precontact position.
NOTE: The Thunderbirds Demonstration Team, MAJCOM Single Ship Demonstration Teams, aviation
record setting flights, and USAF vintage aircraft programs (such as the Heritage Flight Texan Flight pro-
grams) will use operational criteria provided in their own approved Air Force or MAJCOM instructions;
all other Air Force aircraft participating in aerial events will use the criteria presented in this paragraph.
    1.6.1. Showmanship and Professionalism. Aerial events have many objectives among which are to
    entertain the spectators and to inform the general public on Air Force capabilities. In planning and
    performing aerial events, supervisors, pilots, aircrew members and all other participants should
    remember the objective is to demonstrate Air Force professionalism and competence to the general
    public. Strict compliance with show lines, flying procedures, and minimum altitude restrictions reflect
    a high degree of professionalism and contribute markedly to great showmanship.
    1.6.2. Weather Minimums. Weather must allow operations under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) in accor-
    dance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3,
    MDS Specific Operations Procedures. Weather minimums are “flyover minimum altitude” plus 500
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                       7


  feet and 3 miles visibility. The MAJCOM or mission commander may set higher minimums based on
  the nature of the event, local terrain, or other factors.
  1.6.3. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 and in Federal Aviation
  Administration (FAA) regulations for congested and non-congested areas apply. If the venue for an
  event is on a riverbank with a show line or flyover ground track over water or over the opposite bank,
  treat this location for a flyover as a congested area since spectators can congregate on both sides of the
  river. If the venue for an event is on the shore of the ocean, large bay, or large lake with a show line or
  flyover ground track over the open water, treat this location for a flyover as a non-congested area.
     1.6.3.1. USAF Minimum Altitudes. In certain cases, such as demonstration team performances,
     approved maneuver packages, and entry and exit into flyover areas, the FAA may specifically
     waive the altitude requirements below. Even if the FAA authorizes a lower altitude, USAF con-
     trolled aircraft must not be flown lower than the following minimum altitudes:
         1.6.3.1.1. 500 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft.
         1.6.3.1.2. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than the minimums specified
         in paragraph 1.6.3.1.1. for operating rotary wing aircraft in the execution of approved aircraft
         demonstration profiles, when the lower altitudes are necessary to properly demonstrate capa-
         bilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the safe operation of their assets.
  1.6.4. Airspeed Limitations. Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3 applies to all aerial events.
  The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft participating in any military or
  civilian event is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft configuration. Airlift aircraft used in dem-
  onstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such as assault takeoffs or assault landings, may be
  flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds lower than specified in technical order publications.
  Maximum airspeed is limited to .90 MACH, or a lower airspeed if stipulated in a governing FAA
  waiver, for all aerial demonstrations except for approved record flights and demonstration teams.
  Demonstration teams will use a maximum speed of .95 MACH. FAA waiver may be required for air-
  speeds above 250kts below 10,000 MSL.
  1.6.5. Time Limitations. Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, aerial events are
  authorized only between the beginning of Morning Civil Twilight and the end of Evening Civil Twi-
  light. The USAF Academy Wings of Blue parachute team is authorized an exception to this policy
  provided a FAA waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, Certificate of Waiver or Authorization Application)
  is obtained for each night jump in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
  105.21.
  1.6.6. Communications. Aerial Control Teams (ACT) and on-site ground supervisors should use dis-
  crete radio frequencies to control aviation assets.
  1.6.7. Spectator Area. The event organizer for aerial demonstrations must set up a designated specta-
  tor area safely separated from the area over which the aerial demonstrations will occur—safety is
  always a primary consideration in selecting the spectator area and in establishing the show line for
  flight operations. Official observers and spectators must stay within their designated area. Aircraft
  conducting demonstrations at military or civilian events will not over-fly the designated spectator area
  unless specifically granted a waiver by FAA and the parent MAJCOM. The event organizer must
  ensure a 1,500-foot minimum distance exists between the spectator area and the show line for all mil-
  itary aircraft demonstrations. Under the following circumstances, the 1,500-foot minimum distance
  can be reduced to the following:
8                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


       1.6.7.1. To 1,200 feet between the spectator area and the show line if the FAA grants such a
       waiver and if the parent MAJCOM approves.
       1.6.7.2. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the show line for T-6 Texan II demonstra-
       tions.
       1.6.7.3. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the intended airdrop impact point or the drop
       zone boundary (whichever is greater) for the following tactical airdrop demonstrations:
           1.6.7.3.1. Equipment
           1.6.7.3.2. Container Delivery System
           1.6.7.3.3. Personnel using round canopies
       1.6.7.4. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for a helicopter operational dem-
       onstration and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault takeoff demonstrations.
       1.6.7.5. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for USAF vintage aircraft pro-
       grams.
       1.6.7.6. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for glider aerial demonstrations;
       notwithstanding, only 200 feet is required between spectators and glider aircraft during takeoff
       and 75 feet during landing.
       1.6.7.7. To 50 feet between the spectator area and the landing target for the airdrop of precision
       parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of Blue) when steerable square main and
       reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may include a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) dem-
       onstration.

1.7. Compliance with Flight Procedures. For aircraft operations outside the United States, comply
with host nation air rules and procedures and with the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide. Coordinate with
host nation Air Traffic Control representatives before an over flight of a foreign country. For air opera-
tions in the United States, comply with all FAA rules and instructions.

1.8. Waiver Process. For situations that require waivers to FAA regulations and AF instructions, obtain
the FAA waiver before staffing the AF waiver request. Obtain the FAA waiver and determinations on
FAA policy through the local Flight Standards District Office.

1.9. Force Protection. The safety of Air Force personnel and the protection of Air Force aircraft and
equipment are paramount. Force protection measures should always be taken into consideration, whether
participating in flyovers, aerial demonstrations, and aerial reviews, or conducting static displays. It is
imperative that all Air Force members at all levels become situationally aware of potential threats to Air
Force personnel and equipment when deciding to participate in any military or civilian event. Refer to
AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight Operations; AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Pro-
gram; and AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses (when published) for force protection con-
siderations – this must be reviewed for applicability prior to planning a base open house.

1.10. Other Guidance. For comprehensive guidance on Air Force participation in military and civilian
events, community relations programs, and commercial activities such as air and trade shows, see AFI

                                          RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA). International events for which avia-
tion support is requested or tasked must be evaluated to ensure political, military and industry concerns
are taken into consideration. This responsibility rests with SAF/IA. Additionally, SAF/IA coordinates
with Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)), Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA),
HQ USAF/A3O and MAJCOMS for International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions as outlined in para-
graph 5.10. For international events that are outlined in paragraph 5.9. (public affairs activities), SAF/IA
coordination may be required if there is a significant political, military or industry concern. This coordi-
nation does not preempt or diminish the combatant commander’s authority to exercise event and partici-
pation approval over events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR).

2.2. Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs (SAF/PA). Public events for which Air Force aviation
support is requested must be evaluated to ensure their legitimacy, suitability and appropriateness for Air
Force association, involvement or participation. This responsibility rests with SAF/PA when the venues
for such events fall within the United States, Canada or Mexico. SECAF has delegated to SAF/PA the
authority to approve exceptions to flyover policy, with HQ USAF/A3O coordination and concurrence.
SAF/PA is also responsible for coordination with OASD/PA and interface with requestors.

2.3. HQ USAF Director of Current Operations and Training (HQ USAF/A3O) Responsibilities.
     2.3.1. Waiver Requests. HQ USAF/A3O is the approval authority for waiver requests to this instruc-
     tion, unless otherwise stated.
     2.3.2. Unique Requests. HQ USAF/A3O is the approval authority for requests not covered by this
     instruction. Submit such requests to HQ USAF/A3OO for evaluation and approval, after obtaining
     MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will submit requests at least 45 calendar days before the event.
     2.3.3. Funeral Flyovers. In unique cases when a funeral flyover is authorized (IAW paragraph
     3.6.2.3.1.), HQ USAF/A3O retains authority to disapprove support if the circumstances of the death
     and subsequent flyover could reflect negatively upon the Air Force.
     2.3.4. Exception-to-Policy (ETP) for Flyovers. HQ USAF/A3O provides coordination and concur-
     rence for SAF/PAN approved ETP flyovers and other aerial events as detailed in Attachment 2.
     2.3.5. Leases. HQ USAF/A3O approves participation plans at airshows involving USAF aircraft
     leased to non-government organizations, IAW AFI 64-103, Leasing USAF Aircraft and Related
     Equipment to Nongovernment Organizations. Plans should be submitted to HQ USAF/A3O no later
     than 60 days prior to the event. See AFI 64-103 for requirements.

2.4. MAJCOM Duties.
     2.4.1. Evaluates requests for Air Force aviation support.
     2.4.2. Coordinates with SAF/PA, SAF/IA, HQ USAF/A3OO and/or other agencies, as required, to
     determine the extent of participation authorized. OCONUS MAJCOMS coordinate initially with
     Combatant Command. See paragraph 5.9. for overseas events that require HQ USAF or Office of the
     Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD)/PA approval or coordination.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                   11


  2.4.3. Approves operational participation in public or military events within their Area of Responsi-
  bility according to Attachment 2 and AFI 35-101, Chapter 8.
  2.4.4. Coordinates and obtains aviation support for public and military events when requested by HQ
  USAF/A3OO. Units may require external funding identification and coordination for certain events
  prior to participation approval.
  2.4.5. Ensures all command personnel participating in public or military events meet the following
  standards:
     2.4.5.1. Pilots and aircrew are highly qualified and proficient in the flying procedures, standard
     profiles, and demonstration techniques (reference AFI 11-246 appropriate aircraft volume)
     planned for the event.
     2.4.5.2. Personnel exhibit superb military bearing and are present in the proper uniform at the air-
     craft or equipment during periods of public viewing.
     2.4.5.3. Personnel possess in-depth knowledge of the aircraft or equipment and of the Air Force,
     in general.
     2.4.5.4. Personnel can communicate effectively with the public.
  2.4.6. Provides a single point of contact (POC) within the Operations Directorate for all command
  participation in military or public events covered by this instruction. Provides the POC’s name, rank,
  office symbol, e-mail address, and Defense Switched Network (DSN) and commercial voice and fax
  numbers to HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PA. The designated POC may be in a subordinate Numbered
  Air Force (NAF).
  2.4.7. Ensures a planned flyover profile is tailored to the specific event site. The unit commander or a
  designated representative must review and approve these profiles. The approving authority must
  ensure compliance with applicable Air Force policy directives and instructions, aircraft specific train-
  ing manuals, MAJCOM supplements, and all FAA/Host Nation rules and regulations. Deviations
  from approved flight profiles are not authorized except for safety of flight.
  2.4.8. Ensures aircraft and equipment placed on static display are made safe according to Attach-
  ment 3 and MAJCOM guidance.
  2.4.9. Coordinates all planned participation in military or public events with the FAA through the
  regional Air Force representative (or host nation equivalent). This can be delegated to the participat-
  ing unit. Coordination is not required if participation consists only of static display support.
  2.4.10. Provides an Aerial Control Team (ACT) as directed in MAJCOM supplement to this instruc-
  tion and in the following cases:
     2.4.10.1. Events requiring precise timing.
     2.4.10.2. High visibility events (i.e., the Super Bowl).
     2.4.10.3. Aerial Reviews.
     2.4.10.4. Directed by HQ USAF/A3O.
     2.4.10.5. Events within the Washington, DC National Capital Region (NCR).
12                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     2.4.11. Submits requests to SAF/PA for coordination and participation approval of foreign aircraft or
     foreign military demonstration teams (flying teams or parachute demonstration teams) in CONUS
     open house events.
     2.4.12. Requests waivers to this instruction.
     2.4.13. MAJCOMs may delegate duties, responsibilities and approval levels within their supplement
     to this instruction, unless specifically prohibited by this instruction.

2.5. Mission Commander. In general, the mission commander is the on-scene commander responsible
for the overall safety and conduct of the mission and makes the "go" or "no-go" decision. A mission com-
mander is required for flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial demonstrations. The mission commander, or
deputy, must be highly qualified, having a thorough understanding of the aerial event being undertaken.
The mission commander’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to, flyover safety, weather consid-
erations, timing, sequencing, and airspace and range clearances. The mission commander should be able
to directly communicate with the pilot or aircraft commander or should be able to relay information to the
pilot or aircraft commander. In some cases, the senior member of the ACT is designated as the mission
commander. In the event the senior member of the ACT is not the mission commander, then the mission
commander may be one of the following:
     2.5.1. The aircraft commander on a fixed-wing aircraft/helicopter having an aircrew.
     2.5.2. The pilot in a single-seat fighter or trainer aircraft.
     2.5.3. Flight lead for a fighter/trainer formation.
     2.5.4. Ground-based military officer acting as an air boss for an airshow or other ceremony.
     2.5.5. Senior enlisted military member working in the tower.
     2.5.6. DoD-civilian Airspace Manager with ATC Tower or Rated Pilot experience working in the
     control tower.

2.6. Aerial Control Team (ACT) Responsibilities. An ACT is a highly experienced individual or team
of individuals organized and established to control Air Force participation in military and public events.
Each MAJCOM will establish qualifications for ACT members. Employing an ACT is appropriate when
Air Force participation includes large numbers of aircraft or aircraft from more than one MAJCOM or
Service. For events within the NCR, coordination for ACT support must be made through ACC/A3OA,
DSN 574-7854, not later than (NLT) 7 duty days prior to the event. For flyovers occurring at Arlington
National Cemetery, coordination will occur as soon as possible. The ACT is responsible for the following:
    2.6.1. Planning Air Force participation and coordinating details with participating commands, com-
    manders, participants, and the FAA.
    2.6.2. Briefing commanders and participants on all aspects of participation to include, at a minimum,
    flight profiles, airspeeds, altitudes, holding patterns, communication frequencies, air traffic control
    coverage, area traffic density, area hazards, weather minimums, alternate weather procedures, and
    other relevant operational considerations.
    2.6.3. Controlling the flow and movement of all participating aircraft. ACTs will use discrete radio
    frequencies when possible.
    2.6.4. Serving as the on-scene advisor to the mission commander, or as the mission commander if
    requested by the MAJCOM.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                    13


                                                Chapter 3

                                   EVENT APPROVAL PROCESS

3.1. General Approval Process. Air Force participation in any event requires approval from Public
Affairs and Operations. Public Affairs is concerned with the appropriateness of an event for Air Force
involvement. Operational approval is concerned with operational issues. For public events outside the
United States, Canada and Mexico, the combatant commander has authority over the approval and partic-
ipation in events within the command’s Area of Responsibility (AOR). In this case, comply with combat-
ant command directives and utilize this chapter as general guidance for the event. See paragraph 5.9. for
additional requirements for overseas events.

3.2. Public Event Approval. Civilian sponsors of public events in the United States, Canada and Mex-
ico seeking Air Force aviation support must request event approval from SAF/PA using DD Form 2535,
Request for Military Aerial Support. Military sponsors of public events are also required to send the DD
Form 2535 (except as noted in paragraph 3.2.2.) through their MAJCOM/PA to SAF/PA with as much
lead time as possible (usually a minimum of 45 days), before any Air Force asset can participate in their
events. SAF/PA evaluates the information in the DD Form 2535 to determine the eligibility of the events
specified for the aviation support requested using the guidance found in DoD Directive 5410.18, DoD
Instruction 5410.19, AFI 35-101, and other applicable publications and instructions. For a comprehensive
discussion on the DD Form 2535 or to obtain a copy, see the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web
site (http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) and select “Request Procedures.” Civilian sponsors seeking
aviation support (flyovers or AFPT demos) for public events that directly support commemorations of
patriotic holidays are still required to submit a DD Form 2535. Civilian or military sponsors who seek Air
Force aviation support for public events planned outside the United States, Canada and Mexico will com-
ply with COCOM directives to obtain event approval. The DD Form 2535 may be submitted to MAJ-
COM/PA (in lieu of SAF/PA) for events that involve only static display, or when the events directly
support the commemoration of a Patriotic Holiday (i.e., not in conjunction with a sporting event; see para-
graph 3.6.2.1.1.).
   3.2.1. SAF/PA determines eligibility, IAW DoD and AF policy, for the following:
       3.2.1.1. Aviation-related events (aviation shows, aviation fairs, aviation expositions, airport ded-
       ications, events primarily designed to encourage the advancement of aviation, and civic events
       that contribute to the public knowledge of Armed Forces aviation equipment and capabilities)—
       SAF/PA processes event approval requests for aviation-related public events IAW standing, inter-
       nal procedures and posts notification of those approved to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Sup-
       port web site.
       3.2.1.2. Non-aviation related events (e.g., professional/amateur sports, community relations
       events, parades, festivals, etc.)—SAF/PA processes event approval for non-aviation related public
       events IAW Exception-to-Policy (ETP) procedures. The ETP process involves the HQ USAF/A3
       community as well as SAF/PA and is outlined in paragraph 3.5.. ETP approvals are granted only
       when participation is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF. Event sponsors should fol-
       low the ETP procedures posted on the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site when
       requesting event approval for non-aviation related events. The DD Form 2535 and ETP documen-
       tation should reach SAF/PA 45 days in advance of the event’s date. Forms received within 14 days
       of an event are generally not considered for support.
14                                                                                 AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     3.2.2. Approved Military-Sponsored Public Events. The following on-base public events are
     approved for Air Force aviation support and need no further Public Affairs approval. Operations
     approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviation support planned for these events is still
     required.
        3.2.2.1. Military open house events. A DD Form 2535 is required for DoD demonstration team
        requests. A copy must be forwarded through MAJCOM/PA to SAF/PA for consolidation, prioriti-
        zation and posting.
        3.2.2.2. USAF Academy flyovers. See Chapter 5 for procedures.
        3.2.2.3. The National Guard Academy of Military Science flyovers.

3.3. Military Event Approval. Military event approval rests with the MAJCOM hosting the event or as
specified in DoD policy.
     3.3.1. Approved Military Events. The following military events are approved for Air Force aviation
     support IAW current DoD and AF Public Affairs policy and need no further Public Affairs coordina-
     tion. Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviation support planned for
     these events is still required. Approval for military events does not constitute approval for an aerial
     review (see paragraphs 1.4.3., 3.6.3., and 4.3. for aerial review criteria, restrictions and approval lev-
     els).
        3.3.1.1. On-base patriotic observances (see paragraph 3.6.2.1. for off-base criteria).
        3.3.1.2. Retirement ceremonies and change of command ceremonies (see paragraph 3.6.2.2. for
        criteria).
        3.3.1.3. Funeral or memorial events (see paragraph 3.6.2.3. for criteria).
        3.3.1.4. On-base unit change of aircraft and unit flag retirement ceremonies.
        3.3.1.5. The installation commander may deem other on-base military events eligible based on the
        contribution such events make to fostering esprit de corps, military values and patriotism, and on
        their ability to stand the test of public scrutiny. Examples of other eligible events are: military
        graduation ceremonies, retreat ceremonies, memorial ceremonies, and military parades. MAJ-
        COMs have the authority to approve flyovers or jump platform aircraft by their assigned opera-
        tional aircraft in support of approved events on their respective command bases.
     3.3.2. Disapproved Military Events. The following military events or ceremonies are not approved
     for Air Force aviation support IAW current DoD and AF policy: off-base retirement ceremonies,
     off-base change of command ceremonies, off-base unit flag retirement ceremonies, and off-base unit
     change of aircraft ceremonies.

3.4. SAF/PA Approval Process. Once SAF/PA determines an event appropriate for Air Force aviation
support, it is posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site (http://www.air-
shows.pa.hq.af.mil/) as an “Eligible Event.” This is the primary means SAF/PA uses to communicate
with event sponsors and military flying units and/or AF parachute demonstration teams on event
approval. Being declared eligible does not mean Air Force “participation approval” has been granted (this
is an Operations consideration) or that a unit has volunteered to provide the event aviation support.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                    15


   3.4.1. Units wishing to volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the website or via
   telephone to SAF/PAN. Event sponsors may contact units to solicit aviation support for their events.
       3.4.1.1. Units volunteering for any ETP event must notify SAF/PAN and MAJCOM of their
       intent to support not later than 7 days prior to the event (normally 14 days prior or earlier). All
       events that do not have a volunteer unit will be removed from the web site 7 days prior and will
       not be considered for support. Units must also coordinate with event sponsors.
       3.4.1.2. MAJCOMs may require a unit to volunteer via MAJCOM rather than directly with SAF/
       PAN (see MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
   3.4.2. SAF/PA and SAF/IA, in turn, are the approval authorities for events planned specifically for a
   foreign dignitary, to include the type and level of aviation support that is appropriate. Event sponsors
   are to submit requests at least 45 calendar days in advance.

3.5. Exception-to-Policy Procedures for Public Events. Public events for which ETP procedures apply
must be evaluated and approved by both SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O; participation approval is dele-
gated to the MAJCOMs for the aviation support that approved ETP events are ultimately rendered (see
Chapter 4). The event sponsor initiates the ETP process by submitting a DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA IAW
procedures listed in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8, and the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. The
following procedures outline the ETP approval process for public events unless aviation related (IAW
paragraph 3.2.1.1.) or in direct support of a Patriotic Holiday.
   3.5.1. Annually HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PA will release a joint message, categorizing as depicted
   below, the events for the coming year for which event sponsors are requesting ETP event approval.
   The message will assign the level of aviation support considered appropriate for selected events by
   name and for other events by category.
       3.5.1.1. Category 1 (Cat 1). Events designated Cat 1 will be listed by event name and are auto-
       matically granted event approval—they are of such importance that every effort will be taken to
       support them. Aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship formation. Volunteer units will
       be solicited—if no units volunteer, HQ USAF/A3O will coordinate with appropriate MAJCOMs
       and task selected units for aviation support. Relatively few ETP events will fall into Cat 1 (some
       examples are the Super Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Indianapolis 500, etc.).
       3.5.1.2. Category 2 (Cat 2). Events designated Cat 2 will be listed by general classes of events,
       such as a specific sport or events for which Air Force Recruiting Service has a sponsorship role.
       As events are placed in Cat 2, they are granted event approval and aviation support is
       pre-approved up to a four-ship formation. Cat 2 events are supported by volunteer units and typi-
       cally will not be tasked.
       3.5.1.3. Category 3 (Cat 3). Events not identified under Cat 1 or 2 fall into Cat 3. SAF/PA and
       HQ USAF/A3O will jointly determine if a given Cat 3 event warrants event approval and, if
       approved, will specify an appropriate type and level of aviation support (e.g., 4-ship, 2-ship, sin-
       gle-ship, etc.). Approved Cat 3 events are to be supported by volunteer units and typically will not
       be tasked.
   3.5.2. Events approved under one of the categories above are considered to have ETP event approval
   and are posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. HQ USAF/A3O delegates partic-
   ipation approval to MAJCOM/A3 for events approved under the above categories. MAJCOM/A3 will
   ensure that the volunteer unit will support the event as an addition to an approved training mission and
16                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     that the support rendered will pass the test of public scrutiny (i.e. training accomplished, impact to
     operations, proximity of event to the base, additional support requirements, and wing commander sup-
     port). Once participation approval is granted, the MAJCOM/A3 office responsible for aerial events
     will inform HQ USAF/A3OO NLT two working days prior to the event. Notification will include at a
     minimum the participation approval, unit, type, and number of supporting aircraft.

3.6. Specific Aviation Support for Public or Military Events - Event Approval Considerations. The
following paragraphs outline additional guidance bearing on the event approval process (see Approval
Matrix in Attachment 2).
     3.6.1. Static Display. Events for which static displays are requested require Public Affairs event
     approval or as delegated in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8. Refer to paragraph 3.6.2.2. for Retirement or
     Change of Command ceremony criteria.
     3.6.2. Flyover. In general, an event for which a flyover is requested requires Public Affairs event
     approval IAW paragraphs 3.2. through 3.5. above, except as noted below.
        3.6.2.1. Off-Base Patriotic Holiday. As a matter of DoD and Air Force policy, aviation support
        in the form of flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations) is authorized for off-base patriotic observances,
        i.e., commemorative events held in support of patriotic holidays. Such events must be evaluated
        by at least MAJCOM/PA prior to receiving aviation support to ensure compliance with governing
        policies and procedures. The commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstra-
        tion) is performed must occur within seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday.
            3.6.2.1.1. The commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstration) is per-
            formed must directly support the patriotic holiday. Non-commemorative events merely falling
            within seven days of the national days of observance for the applicable holidays are not eligi-
            ble for flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations), unless approved by SAF/PA through normal pro-
            cedures. An example of a non-commemorative event would be a sporting event held on or near
            Independence Day, even one with a solemn ceremony or moment of silence.
            3.6.2.1.2. See paragraph 3.6.2.4. for guidance on use of the Missing Man Formation at patri-
            otic observances.
            3.6.2.1.3. The event sponsor must submit a completed DD Form 2535 to MAJCOM/PA or
            SAF/PA, where it is reviewed to ensure the event is actually a commemorative event suitable
            for Air Force participation. Local bases receiving DD Forms 2535 should forward them
            through their MAJCOM/PA and on to SAF/PA, if applicable.
        3.6.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Flyovers or aerial reviews for off-base
        retirement or change of command ceremonies are not permitted. Ceremonies eligible for aerial
        support, if they are held on-base, are approved only for the following personnel as noted below:
            3.6.2.2.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or any combatant commander is autho-
            rized an aerial review. Air Force participation in COCOM multi-service or multi-national
            aerial reviews is approved. MAJCOMs will provide an information copy to HQ USAF/A3O
            containing the number and type of aircraft participating.
            3.6.2.2.2. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF), a MAJCOM/CC or a State
            Adjutant General is authorized a flyover by a single formation (up to four-ship).
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                     17


          3.6.2.2.3. A MAJCOM/CV, a NAF/CC, or a Center/CC is authorized a flyover by a single air-
          craft.
          3.6.2.2.4. AFPT jumps in lieu of flyovers are allowed for the personnel authorized above.
          3.6.2.2.5. On-base retirement and change of command ceremonies for any other military
          members are not eligible for an Air Force flyover, except when approved IAW ETP proce-
          dures (paragraph 3.6.2.2.6.).
          3.6.2.2.6. Exception-to-policy requests for flyovers supporting retirement and change of com-
          mand ceremonies require HQ USAF/CV approval. HQ USAF/CV approval is required for a
          flyover if the participating aircraft is (are) from another service, nation, or civilian organiza-
          tion.
          3.6.2.2.7. MAJCOMs may authorize aviation support, with their respective aircraft, in the
          form of static displays for on-base retirement or change of command ceremonies (as desig-
          nated in MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
       3.6.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. Funeral and memorial services for members who meet
       the governing criteria are eligible for Air Force flyovers. Funeral and memorial service flyover
       requests will be initiated by the servicing base Mortuary Officer or Air Force Mortuary Affairs
       and staffed through MAJCOMs (Mortuary Affairs and Operations directorates) to HQ USAF/
       A3OO. Funeral flyover request procedures can be found in AFI 34-242. A funeral or memorial
       flyover is to be flown as part of a training sortie, not as a stand-alone mission.
NOTE: The servicing base Mortuary Affairs or Air Force Mortuary Affairs is the single point of contact
for the next of kin.
          3.6.2.3.1. Eligibility. The following list outlines those eligible for an Air Force funeral/memo-
          rial flyover:
              3.6.2.3.1.1. Active duty or currently serving Air Reserve Component (ARC) rated officers
              (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, observers, and flight surgeons) and Career Enlisted
              Aviators (1AXXX enlisted crewmembers, i.e. flight engineers, loadmasters, boom opera-
              tors, etc.). This category includes those taking courses of instruction leading to an aeronau-
              tical rating. Treat ARC members the same as active duty (eligible when death occurs
              whether on or off duty). This includes ARC members not on unit training assembly (UTA)
              or military orders.
              3.6.2.3.1.2. Active duty or currently serving ARC non-rated officers, non-Career Enlisted
              Aviators, and Operations Support Flyers (as defined in AFI 11-402, Aviation and Para-
              chutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, i.e. nurses, medical technicians, intelli-
              gence specialists, etc.) but only when death occurs in the line of duty while performing
              aviation duties.
              3.6.2.3.1.3. Dignitaries of the Armed Forces and federal government. HQ USAF/A3O has
              the authority to designate Dignitaries of the Armed Forces; requests with full justification
              must be made through the MAJCOM staff to HQ AF/A3OO.
              3.6.2.3.1.4. Active duty or retired USAF 3-star and 4-star general officers, regardless of
              aeronautical rating.
              3.6.2.3.1.5. Active Duty or retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force (CMSAF).
18                                                                             AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


             3.6.2.3.1.6. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who have been
             awarded the Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Army Distinguished Service Cross, or
             Navy Cross.
             3.6.2.3.1.7. USAF aviators (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who have
             achieved at least one or more officially recognized aerial victories. The Air Force Histori-
             cal Research Agency is the official source for aerial victories.
             3.6.2.3.1.8. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who were Pris-
             oners of War.
NOTE: Repatriated remains of individuals meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.6.2.3.1.1. or
3.6.2.3.1.2. are entitled to flyover honors.
          3.6.2.3.2. Although a funeral/memorial flyover may be authorized by meeting the above cri-
          teria, it may not always be appropriate. A funeral or memorial flyover is part of the honors
          bestowed on the deceased. If the lifestyle of an individual during or following his or her mili-
          tary service is not within the standards normally expected of a military professional or if the
          circumstances surrounding the death reflect negatively on the Air Force, a funeral flyover may
          not be approved in all cases. HQ USAF/A3O will make the determination in these cases.
          3.6.2.3.3. If a deceased member is eligible, no further HQ USAF approval is required. MAJ-
          COMs grant participation approval for funeral/memorial flyovers (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
          3.6.2.3.4. Memorial Flyovers. Procedures and approval levels for memorial flyovers are the
          same as for funeral flyovers. Memorial flyovers commemorate or recognize an individual,
          group, or historically significant event. MAJCOMs may approve on-base flyovers in this cate-
          gory (may be delegated to Wing/CC). For deceased members authorized a flyover per para-
          graph 3.6.2.3.1., and when the funeral service is held off-base, MAJCOM may authorize an
          additional memorial flyover at the base to which the individual was assigned (inform HQ
          USAF/A3OO). An off-base memorial flyover on other than the five patriotic holidays requires
          an ETP approved by HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PAN.
          3.6.2.3.5. Exceptions-to-Policy. Servicing base Mortuary Affairs initiates requests for excep-
          tions to funeral and memorial service policy and staffs the request through MAJCOMs to HQ
          USAF/A3OO. Requests that are handled directly by Air Force Mortuary Affairs are staffed to
          HQ USAF/A3OO. Exceptions-to-policy are based on appropriate use of limited resources, and
          are typically considered only for service marked by valor or heroism, or has significantly
          impacted the aviation community or aviation history. ETP requests must reach HQ USAF AF/
          A3OO at least 5 working days prior to the event. HQ USAF/A3OO will coordinate a package
          for HQ USAF/CVA decision. Include the following in the request:
             3.6.2.3.5.1. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or
             similar discharge documentation recording the individual’s honorable discharge, rank, and
             decorations.
             3.6.2.3.5.2. A letter from the next of kin or the person acting on their behalf requesting the
             flyover.
             3.6.2.3.5.3. A biography of the individual’s service. Include commands and significant
             acts or service to the Air Force and the country.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                   19


              3.6.2.3.5.4. Any other information about the individual’s military service that is notable.
          3.6.2.3.6. If an exception is approved, HQ USAF/A3OO will inform MAJCOMs to solicit a
          volunteer unit to perform the flyover. Due to the short-notice nature of many funerals, MAJ-
          COMs may be asked to solicit volunteers while the approval package is being processed.
       3.6.2.4. Missing Man Formation. The missing man formation is a flyover reserved for appro-
       priate occasions and is employed only on those occasions when the theme is solemn and com-
       memorative. This formation may be flown for any funeral or memorial approved IAW this AFI or
       to support commemorative events on the following Patriotic Holidays: 1) Memorial Day, 2)
       National POW/MIA Day, and 3) Veterans Day. When the missing man formation is flown on a
       Patriotic Holiday, the commemorative event, which the formation supports, may not be held in
       conjunction with another event such as an airshow or sporting event. All other uses of the missing
       man formation require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
       3.6.2.5. For additional information, see paragraph 3.2. and 3.3., and Chapter 5.
   3.6.3. Aerial Review. OASD/PA approval is required for all CONUS public event aerial reviews and
   overseas public event aerial reviews involving CONUS based aircraft. This approval is not required at
   airshows, open houses or international trade shows.
       3.6.3.1. Submit aerial review requests through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAN (inform HQ USAF/
       A3OO) 45 calendar days before the event date. The request should include the date, location, type
       of event (dedication ceremony, retirement, etc.), and number/type of aircraft. SAF/PA will coordi-
       nate OASD/PA approval NLT 30 calendar days before the event to allow time for MAJCOM/A3
       or higher participation approval. For the approval of an event for which an aerial review is
       requested, and which is hosted at a venue outside the United States, Canada or Mexico, see para-
       graph 5.9. and Attachment 2.
       3.6.3.2. The performance of multiple aerial events for a single public event constitutes a signifi-
       cant level of Air Force support and communicates to the general public, and event organizer, a
       “public affairs” endorsement for the event that is as significant as the endorsement that an aerial
       review would render. To ensure the proper levels of scrutiny and control, proposals for aviation
       support involving the performance of multiple aerial events for a single public event will be sub-
       ject to the same approval process that a proposal for an aerial review would receive for the same
       public event. To this end, SAF/PAN and AF/A3O will approve aviation support proposals for sin-
       gle public events that combine an AFPT and flyover, or a flyover and aircraft demonstration (the
       total number of combined individual elements may not exceed four). An example of such a com-
       bination of aerial events is a 3-ship of F-16s and an AFPT demonstration. Aviation support pro-
       posals for single public events that combined multiple aerial events will be reviewed on a
       case-by-case basis. When determining the number of elements, the jump platform aircraft does not
       count unless it is performing in some other function in addition to being the jump platform.
NOTE: The guidance in this paragraph does not apply to aviation support proposals involving multiple,
combined aerial events planned for open house events, public airshows, and international trade shows.
   3.6.4. Aerial Demonstration.
       3.6.4.1. Although considered an aerial demonstration, AFPT performances have different
       approval procedures. See paragraph 5.4.. AFPT demonstrations can be performed in lieu of fly-
       overs for Patriotic Holidays (paragraph 3.6.2.1.).
20                                                                           AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     3.6.4.2. Flying operations ostensibly conducted for training but which are actually intended to be
     viewed by non-military audiences are in fact aerial demonstrations and the events supported in
     this manner are public events falling under paragraphs 1.2. and 3.2.. An example would be the use
     of Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) missions to airdrop personnel and/or
     equipment for training while inviting a non-military audience to view the airdrop through a public
     advertising campaign (TV/radio announcements, newspaper ads, etc.). In this example, clearly
     the use of advertising to encourage the presence of non-military spectators establishes the activity
     as an aerial demonstration for a public event.
     3.6.4.3. Flying operations conducted for training purposes (whether using training or O&M fund-
     ing) on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD, and intended for viewing by an audience
     limited to military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents and limited number of invited
     guests, constitute aerial demonstrations in support of military events, and paragraphs 1.3. and 3.3.
     apply.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                      21

                              PARTICIPATION APPROVAL PROCESS

4.1. Static Displays. Participation approval for static displays is delegated to MAJCOM. MAJCOM can
delegate participation approval authority to a lower level. Before approving static display, the decision
process will include force protection concerns. Consider the safety standards in Attachment 3, along with
those in T.O. 00-80G, Make Safe Procedures for Public Static Display series publications, in planning and
staging each static display. Aircraft specific guidance in a T.O. will supercede the general guidance in this
AFI. The following guidelines apply to all aircraft on static display:
   4.1.1. Aircraft on static display must be made safe according to Attachment 3 and applicable techni-
   cal orders (TO).
   4.1.2. A minimum of one qualified aircrew member must be present to answer spectator questions
   and to ensure security at all times the static display is open to the public.
   4.1.3. Ordnance and Munitions. If an event does not involve the expenditure or display of munitions,
   download the aircraft of all expendable ordnance prior to deploying to the event site. “Make safe” per-
   manently mounted internal weapons according to applicable TO procedures. Place on public display
   only inert munitions, making them safe according to applicable TOs.

4.2. Flyover
   4.2.1. Patriotic Holiday. Participation approval is at the MAJCOM level and is limited to a single
   pass flyover by a single aircraft or by a formation of not more than four aircraft of the same type. The
   commemorative event for which the flyover is performed must occur within seven days of the national
   day of observance of the holiday and must be in direct support of the holiday.
   4.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Participation approval is at the MAJCOM
   level. AF/CV approval may be required for exceptions-to-policy (see paragraph 3.6.2.2.6.).
   4.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM to locate and identify
   volunteer flying units. MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority to a lower level. Air
   Force participation in a funeral or memorial service is limited to a single flyover. It may be flown at
   the funeral (internment) service or at the memorial service, but not at both events (except as approved
   under paragraph 3.6.2.3.4., where the MAJCOM can approve an additional memorial flyover for eli-
   gible members at the base to which the individual was assigned). Funeral flyovers can be a single ship
   or a single formation with a maximum of four aircraft. A formation flyover may be flown as a missing
   man formation (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
   4.2.4. Missing Man Formation. Participation approval for on-base and off-base Patriotic Holidays
   (IAW paragraph 3.6.2.4.) is at the MAJCOM level. All other off-base uses of the missing man forma-
   tion require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).

4.3. Aerial Review. After OASD/PA event approval (if required), the level of participation approval is
as follows:
   4.3.1. Assets from Single MAJCOM. Aerial reviews involving assets from a single MAJCOM
   require MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO of aerial review approvals and
   assets involved (other than airshows, Open Houses and trade shows).
22                                                                               AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     4.3.2. Assets from Multiple MAJCOMs. Multi-MAJCOM aerial reviews require the approval of
     each command providing aircraft for the aerial review (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
     4.3.3. Assets from Multiple Services/Nations, or Involve Civilian Aircraft. H Q U S A F / A 3 / 5
     approval is required for all aerial reviews that combine USAF aircraft with aircraft from other services
     or nations or with civilian aircraft. Participation approval in OCONUS aerial reviews rests with the
     COCOM (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).

4.4. Aerial Demonstration. Aerial demonstrations are governed by the AFI 11-246 series of instructions
and require the participation approval of the owning MAJCOM.
     4.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs need not publish in their assigned volume the profiles that are uniquely tai-
     lored for a specific military or civilian event and which are planned for use on a one-time basis.
     Although the lead MAJCOM is released from the requirement to incorporate these uniquely tailored
     profiles in the command volume, the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent) having jurisdiction over the par-
     ticipating aircrew and aircraft must approve every uniquely tailored profile prior to its execution. If
     the uniquely tailored profile is planned to be used on a continuing basis, then the MAJCOM must sub-
     mit the profile to the lead MAJCOM for possible inclusion in AFI 11-246 series.
     4.4.2. MAJCOMs may publish profiles in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction for flight
     operations or procedures falling outside the purview of the applicable AFI 11-246 series.
     4.4.3. Aerial demonstration profiles, for any aircraft that is not covered under the AFI 11-246 series,
     must be approved by the MAJCOM/CC owning the aircraft. This will not be delegated. MAJCOM
     approved profiles can consist of multiple passes.
     4.4.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed for commemorative events supporting Patriotic holi-
     days instead of flyovers—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
     4.4.5. AFPT demonstrations supporting retirement/change of command ceremonies in lieu of autho-
     rized flyovers are allowed—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                       23

                                       ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

5.1. USAF Academy (USAFA) On-Base Events. All definitions and policy regarding flyovers and
aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved on-base academy events are graduation cere-
monies, football games, parades, ceremonies with a patriotic/military theme, etc. The commandant
requests appropriate Air Force participation, which is limited to flyovers, parachute demonstrations and
glider demonstrations.
   5.1.1. Academy officials will notify participating MAJCOMs when flyovers are scheduled by more
   than one MAJCOM on the same day. Participation must be approved by the owning MAJCOM. When
   more than one flyover is scheduled within any three hour period, this notification will include as a
   minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight, direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point
   of contact, and other information deemed necessary for safety of flight.
   5.1.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the same type making
   one pass.
   5.1.3. USAFA officials will notify HQ USAF/A3OO, SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM 10 days before the
   event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage (i.e., coverage of a football game or
   graduation).

5.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Flyover Requests. Requests from one MAJCOM to another for sin-
gle-ship or formation flyovers in support of military events are approved by the MAJCOM owning the
requested assets.
   5.2.1. Within the USAF, requests for Air Force participation in a military event must be sent from
   requesting unit (base) to its parent MAJCOM and, if approved, from the parent MAJCOM to the
   MAJCOM owning the requested aircraft, except for requests supporting an open house. For an open
   house, the requesting unit may send a request for participation directly to the unit owning the desired
   aircraft or equipment; the owning unit will ensure all coordination/approval requirements imposed by
   the owning MAJCOM are satisfied before committing support.
   5.2.2. Air Force units are to follow MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM procedures when requesting aircraft
   from the US Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. For MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests, include HQ
   USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN as information addressees whenever the approval level involves any of
   the following: HQ USAF/CV, HQ USAF/CVA, HQ USAF/A3/5, HQ USAF/A3O, SAF/AQ or
   OASD/PA.

5.3. Dissimilar Formation. Formations of four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS and the same type are
approved by MAJCOM/A3. Formations of four or fewer aircraft comprised of Air Force aircraft with air-
craft from other services or nations, or with civilian aircraft that do not meet aerial review criteria (i.e.,
airshows, open houses or international trade shows) require MAJCOM/CC approval (inform HQ USAF/
A3OO for HQ USAF/CC and A3/5 visibility). It is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational
oversight when approving mixed MDS formations of the same type. ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 11-246,
Volume 1 covers ACC Heritage Flight formations and AFI 11-246, Volume 2 covers AETC Texan Flight
formations.
24                                                                                  AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


5.4. Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT). Event and participation approval for an AFPT demonstration
(i.e., by the United States Air Force Academy’s “Wings of Blue”) is granted using the same procedures as
a flyover (IAW Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Air Force aircraft serving as jump platforms for AFPT dem-
onstrations at public or military events, do not require separate approval. Event approval for the AFPT
constitutes approval for the jump platform.
NOTE: If the aircraft serving as the jump platform is separately performing at the event (i.e. additional
flyover or aerial demonstration), then separate approval is required. For aircraft serving as jump platforms
supporting other service parachute team demonstrations, the “event approval” for the aircraft is in con-
junction with the approval for the parachute team (inform SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO). Owning
MAJCOM may still require participation approval for their “jump platform” aircraft.

5.5. Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Flights of this nature require SAF/PAN and
HQ USAF/A3O approval. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 8 for additional restrictions.

5.6. Test Aircraft. Aerial events of any kind, including static displays, involving aircraft or equipment
undergoing testing in a research and development program require approval from SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/
A3/5, and SAF/AQ.

5.7. Heritage/Texan Flight Training Programs. The following guidance applies to the ACC Heritage
Flight and AETC Texan Flight Training programs.
     5.7.1. The intent of the annual training program is to prepare Air Force aircrews and vintage aircraft
     pilots to safely fly in formation at public airshows and open house events that benefit Air Force
     recruiting and community relations programs. Appropriated funds may be expended for warbird avia-
     tion fuel associated with that training. Because warbird pilots and support staff are acting in an official
     capacity related to DoD activities, use of invitational travel orders to pay travel, per diem, lodging and
     local transportation is also permitted as specified in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, Appendix
     E. MAJCOM approved Blanket Purchase Agreements with contractors may be used to cover
     expenses.
     5.7.2. MAJCOMs will ensure compliance with applicable AFIs including AFI 11-401, Aviation Man-
     agement. Military aircrew members and key military leadership may fly on warbird civil aircraft dur-
     ing training sessions. Military media personnel and civilian media personnel (as part of an approved
     media orientation flight IAW AFI 35-101) may fly as passengers on those warbirds engaged in obser-
     vation flights provided the aircraft are not engaged in demonstration training or formation flights.
     Training is to take place over unpopulated areas. All warbirds must have liability insurance covering
     training flights and passengers.
     5.7.3. This guidance covers all training conferences and annual preseason flight training conducted in
     accordance with AFI 11-246. Secretary of Defense and CSAF policies regarding civilian pilots oper-
     ating USAF aircraft still apply, unless specifically waived.

5.8. Airshows/Open Houses. The term "open house" identifies a traditional activity held on military
installations while the term “airshow” identifies a civilian activity. Open house and airshow have been
used interchangeably in the past, but open house is a more comprehensive term for the spectrum of events
in the Air Force. Airshows and open houses may be supported by multiple static displays, multiple fly-
overs (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial demonstrations. AFI 10-1004 (when released) will pro-
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                     25


vide guidance and procedures for planning and conducting Air Force open houses. SAF/PA approves
civilian airshows for Air Force support (event approval IAW paragraph 3.2.) and MAJCOMs approve the
participation of their respective aircraft.

5.9. Overseas Public and Military Events. For public events outside the United States, Canada and
Mexico, the combatant commanders exercise event and participation approval over events falling within
their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR) (except as noted below). The combatant commanders may
delegate the responsibility for event and participation approval. The delegates will notify SAF/PAN and
HQ USAF/A3OO of their delegated authority. See paragraph 5.10. for event and participation approval
for international airshow and trade exhibitions.
   5.9.1. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN when CONUS based aircraft will
   participate in overseas events (public or military) at least 30 days prior to the event for CSAF visibil-
   ity. Additionally, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN for any USAF aircraft participation in
   overseas events at non-DoD facilities at least 30 days prior to the event for CSAF visibility. If the
   request from the event is short notice, precluding a 30-day notification, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and
   SAF/PAN immediately. Responsibility for this notification is primarily with the owning MAJCOM,
   but notification may come from the OCONUS MAJCOM. HQ USAF or OASD/PA approval may be
   required in some cases where CONUS based aircraft participate in overseas events.
   5.9.2. Aerial Reviews at overseas events with assets from multiple services or nations, or that involve
   civilian aircraft, will be approved IAW paragraph 4.3. in addition to combatant command directives
   (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
   5.9.3. Notwithstanding the combatant commanders’ participation approval authority over aircraft
   entering their respective AORs, the owning MAJCOMs’ operational control over their aircraft is not
   preempted or diminished.
   5.9.4. Aerial events of any kind involving aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a research and
   development program require approval from SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/A3, and SAF/AQ.

5.10. International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions. This paragraph applies to USAF direct partici-
pation at international airshows and trade exhibitions, organized primarily for promoting sales of aero-
space and other defense products (IAW DoDD 7230.8). For international airshows and other events that
are organized only for the demonstration or display of aircraft and other defense equipment in support of
public affairs activities, see paragraph 5.9..
   5.10.1. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) has approval authority for DoD participation
   in international airshows and trade exhibitions, as delegated by the Secretary of Defense. No Air
   Force organization can participate in an international airshow or trade exhibition unless the USD(P)
   has approved “direct DoD participation” and satisfied the other provisions of the law. The Defense
   Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), staff agency for USD(P), posts policy, guidelines, and status
   information on international airshows and trade exhibitions on its web site (http://www.dsca.osd.mil).
   5.10.2. Geographic combatant commanders, through their Air Force component commanders, and in
   conjunction with the US Embassy country team, implement USD(P) airshow policy and initiate
   requests for participation.
   5.10.3. The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA) coordinates
   Headquarters Air Force actions, to include politico-military analysis, validation of requirements IAW
26                                                                           AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


     USAF Security Cooperation Guidance, identification of USAF assets requested, and coordination
     with industry.
     5.10.4. Additionally, HQ USAF/A3OO will submit the lists of requested USAF assets to the MAJ-
     COMs to determine operational impact and to coordinate participation of assets from outside the
     requesting geographic combatant commander's AOR. During this process, HQ USAF/A3O reconciles
     the asset requests against the MAJCOM's operational concerns, develops requirement lists (with
     USAF senior leadership positions), and tasks support as required.
     5.10.5. MAJCOMs with units planning to participate in international airshows and trade exhibitions
     must first coordinate with DSCA via SAF/IA. This is normally accomplished during periodic telecon-
     ferences hosted by DSCA. Planning and execution details are developed by the MAJCOMs during
     this conference.

5.11. Adopted Forms. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, DD
Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support, and FAA 7711-2, Certificate of Waiver or Authori-
zation Application.

Terms
NOTE: To avoid changing traditional terminology used by the Air Force to discuss aviation support, the
Air Force term aerial event as used in this instruction is synonymous with the DoD term aerial demonstra-
tion and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the DoD term aerial activity.
Aerial Control Team (ACT)—A qualified individual or team of individuals who oversee and control
USAF aerial participation, and aerial participation by other organizations, in selected public or military
events. ACT can be used synonymously with Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) for the purposes of this
instruction.
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually every type
of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or military events (except aerial
review and flyover): aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft weapons or tactics demonstrations,
USAF vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams, airdrop demonstrations of personnel or
equipment, engine-running offload and aircraft backing maneuvers, in-flight refueling demonstrations,
AFPT performances, CSAR demonstrations and helicopter flight demonstrations consisting of steep
approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel AIE. Aerial demonstration is
synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration, aircraft capabilities demonstration, and
aircraft CAPEX.
Aerial Demonstration Team—An officially designated DoD demonstration team such as the USAF
Thunderbirds, US Navy Blue Angels, and US Army Golden Knights, etc. This term can be applied to
USAF vintage aircraft (ACC Heritage Flight Program and AETC T-6A Texan II Aerial Demonstration
Team) and MAJCOM single-ship demonstration teams.
Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display, flyover, aerial
review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of aerial performances (see
definition, above).
Aerial Review—Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four aircraft, or of
multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service or nation, regardless
of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements. An aerial review may include civilian aircraft. It may
30                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


have elements in trail formation and will not involve precision maneuvers or demonstrations. The
elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft, formations, or a combination of individual
aircraft and formations. A single element flyover involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the
same type from the same Military Service is not considered an aerial review.
Aircraft Demonstration—See Aerial Demonstration.
Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration—An aerial demonstration of aircraft employing or
simulating the employment of munitions, weapons, or combat tactics. May include use of ground-based
pyrotechnics for effect.
Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) Demonstration—An aerial free-fall parachute demonstration
conducted by an official Air Force parachute demonstration team (i.e. United States Air Force Academy’s
“Wings of Blue”).
Area of Responsibility—The geographical area associated with a commanders authority to plan and
conduct operations.
Assault Landing Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating a technique used
for landing on short runways. The aircraft is flown at a speed slightly above aircraft stall speed and on a
steeper-than-normal approach path. After touchdown, maximum engine reverse thrust and braking are
applied to stop the aircraft.
Assault (Max Performance) Takeoff Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration
illustrating a takeoff technique used for departing short runways employing maximum takeoff power and
climb rate for the aircraft. Also referred to as Maximum Performance Takeoff or Maximum Effort
Takeoff.
Aviation Support—Aviation support, synonymous with aerial event, comprises static display, flyover,
aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of aerial activities.
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with aircraft
demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon systems. A capabilities
demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting maneuvers usually associated with its
employment and is common to the airframe being shown.
Civil Twilight—The period that ends in the evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below
the horizon and begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon, as
published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time. This is the limit at which twilight
illumination is sufficient, under good weather conditions, for terrestrial objects to be clearly
distinguished, and the horizon is clearly defined under good atmospheric conditions in the absence of
moonlight or other illumination. In the morning before the beginning of Civil Twilight and in the evening
after the end of Civil Twilight, artificial illumination is normally required to carry on ordinary outdoor
activities.
Congested Area—Cities, towns, and settlements or the area surrounding an open-air assembly of
persons.
DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support—The form that event sponsors or organizers use to
request military aerial support. It is normally submitted to SAF/PA to obtain event approval as a first step
in gaining aerial support.
AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                      31


Demonstration Pilot or Crew—A highly qualified pilot or crew trained, proficient, and certified in the
maneuvers or demonstration to be performed.
Dissimilar Formation Flyover—A single element flyover involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple
MDS of the same type (i.e. F-15, F-16).
Eligible Events—Aerial events that have been screened by SAF/PA or other designated organization and
deemed appropriate for Air Force participation.
Equipment Drop Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating the airdrop of
equipment on platforms rigged with parachutes, individual containers rigged with parachutes, or small
door bundles rigged with parachutes.
Event Approval—Issued when SAF/PA or other designated organization, determines the event (e.g.,
aviation show/open house, sporting event, commemoration, or civic event) is eligible for Air Force
participation. Some events have automatic approval by virtue of AF or DoD policy; otherwise, depending
on the nature of the event, the evaluation process is conducted by one of several agencies. Event approval
does not imply participation approval.
Exception-to-Policy Procedure—Procedures outlining the process to gain SAF/PA event approval when
the military or civilian event does not fall within one of the categories addressed by DoD or AF policy.
Submit such requests to SAF/PA who will route appropriate requests to HQ USAF/A3OO for
coordination. See paragraph 3.2.
Flight Team Demonstration—A demonstration by a DoD demonstration team such as the USAF Air
Demonstration Squadron (Thunderbirds) or the US Navy Blue Angels.
Flyover—Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight limited to one pass by a single
military aircraft, or by a single formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the same type from the same
Military Service over a predetermined point on the ground at a specific time and not involving aerobatics
or demonstrations; however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees are permissible and may be used if required
to improve the spectator visibility of the aircraft.
Foreign Military Demonstration Team—Any military demonstration team not part of the DoD. May
include, for example: Canadian Snowbirds, British Red Arrows, Italian Frecce Tri Colore, and the
Japanese Blue Impulse.
Funeral Flyover—A flyover at a funeral, internment, or memorial ceremony that may be flown as a
missing-man formation.
Helicopter Capabilities Demonstration—An aerial demonstration of helicopter capabilities such as
those done during rescue or special operations missions (e.g., hoist, sling, rappelling, fast roping,
pararescue deployment, operational approach, simulated ordnance delivery, etc.).
High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Airdrop Demonstration—Demonstration of personnel delivery
accomplished at or above 3,000 feet AGL. The parachutists free fall to a predetermined altitude before
deploying their parachutes to complete the descent.
Inflight Refueling Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration of aircraft employing
inflight refueling procedures up to and including the precontact position.
International Airshow and Trade Exhibition—An activity organized specifically to promote sales of
aerospace and defense products.
32                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


Jump Platform—Any Air Force aircraft used as a vehicle for a parachute team demonstration used in
support of a military or public event.
Make Safe—To inactivate a weapon, a piece of ordnance, an ejection seat, or other device on an aircraft
or its associated equipment so as to ensure that it cannot fire, launch, explode, detonate, or in any manner
harm or injure spectators or other personnel as a result of its unintended operation (traditionally
synonymous with "dearm," "disarm," and "disable”).
Mission Design Series (MDS)—The designation of an aircraft, i.e. C-130E, F-15C, B-1B.
Memorial—An event that commemorates or serves as a remembrance of a specific person, group, or
historically significant occurrence. A memorial may be held in lieu of a funeral ceremony or on or near
the anniversary of a significant event.
Military Event—An official DoD event (sponsored by DoD or DoD component or command) conducted
in support of an assigned mission, including purposes of esprit-de-corps, primarily for military or civil
service personnel, dependents, and limited guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or
operated by the DoD.
Missing-Man Formation—A four-ship formation with the number three aircraft either missing or
performing a pull-up maneuver at a specific time in the flight.
Multiple Flyovers—A flyover arrangement for a single event in which two or more flyover aircraft, or
two or more flyover formations (or combination of flyover aircraft and flyover formations) conduct
individual flyover passes over the same reference point on the ground regardless of timing separation
between the flyover aircraft or flyover formations.
Multiple Passes—A flyover arrangement for a single event in which the flyover aircraft, or the flyover
formation, maneuvers after the initial over flight of the desired reference point so as to execute one or
more additional passes over the same point.
Next of Kin (NOK)—For the purposes of this instruction, the closest, living relative to a deceased
person.
Off-base—On or over any location other than on-base.
On-base—On or over an installation or facility owned, leased, or operated by the DoD such as a base,
camp, fort, post, reservation, school, ship, station, terminal facility, or range.
Open House—A military program conducted on an installation or other military facility to which the
public is invited. A similar activity in civilian communities is called an airshow.
Parachute Team Demonstration—A demonstration of free fall or precision landing techniques.
Participation Approval—The approval process within the operations community leading to actual Air
Force participation in public or military events.

AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006                                                                                      33


Personnel Drop Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating the airdrop of static
line personnel or paratroopers.
Prisoner of War—An individual who was taken prisoner or held captive while engaged in an action
against an enemy of the United States; while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an
opposing armed force; or while serving with friendly forces engaged in armed conflict against an
opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The person's conduct, while in
captivity, must have been honorable.
Public Event—Public events are community relations events not connected with the military functioning
of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military audiences. Some examples include
military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions, athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos,
airshows, international airshow and trade exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be on or
off-base; CONUS or OCONUS. Public events can be sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD
organizations. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or operations are not considered to be public
events merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the general public. Such events can be good
community relations and recruiting opportunities.
Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature—A flight to achieve an official world-class record
regarding speed, distance, altitude, duration of flight, etc. National and world aviation records conducted
in the United States are sanctioned, observed, and certified through the National Aeronautic Association.
Retirement or Change of Command Ceremony—These are military events. A retirement ceremony
honors a retiring military member and a change of command ceremony formally recognizes the transfer
of command authority from one military member to another (see paragraph 3.6.2.2.).
Show Line—A show line is a prominent reference line appearing on the ground in the "Aerobatic
Demonstration Area/Flying Display Area" established for an Airshow or Open House. The show line
must be easily identifiable from the air and could be an existing structure already present such as a
runway, taxiway, canal, breakwater, or road, or any straight line marked off by a snow fence, canvas
panels, etc. The show line is a prescribed distance from the spectator area and serves as the basic reference
line for aerial demonstrations performances.
Spectator Area—The area specifically set aside at an airshow or Open House for people to view the
aerial demonstrations performed for the event (see paragraph 1.6.7.).
Static Display—Static Display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of any aircraft and its
related equipment not involving engine start, taxi, or flight.
Test/Evaluation Aircraft or Equipment—New aircraft or equipment undergoing developmental test
and evaluation that have not yet met initial operating capability (IOC).
Training Static Display—The ground display of any aircraft and its related equipment used for the sole
purpose of training local civilian medical, rescue, fire, or law enforcement personnel. Training static
displays do not involve engine start, taxi, or flight. Spectators will not be allowed in the training areas.
This can be on or off-base.
Type—The role of the aircraft from a public affairs perspective. DoD defines type as either tactical,
transport or rotary wing. Air Force further categorizes aircraft type as: tactical (F-22, F-15, F-16, A-10,
F-117, B-1, B-2, B-52), tanker/transport (C-130, C-17, C-5, KC-10, KC-135), trainer (T-1, T-37, T-38,
T-6) and rotary wing (UH-1, HH-60, MH-53, CV-22). Aircraft not listed are considered their own unique
type and will comply with multi-type restrictions in this instruction (i.e. Aerial Review or dissimilar
34                                                                              AFI11-209 4 MAY 2006


formation). It is understood that true aircraft roles and missions are numerous and it would be difficult to
categorize all aircraft. These are general groupings based on size, mission and/or configuration as viewed
by the general public. Individual missions and series are grouped under the same design for the purpose of
this definition (i.e. EC-130H, and C-130J). It is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational
oversight when approving mixed MDS formations of the same type.
Unit Change of Aircraft Ceremony—A ceremony that recognizes the conversion of aircraft type within
a unit.
Unit Flag Retirement Ceremony—A ceremony during which an active or air reserve component unit is
