                                            Chapter 2

                                       AUDIT REPORTS

2.1. Overview. This chapter provides information on processing AFAA audit reports and
tracking the implementation of report recommendations. Chapter 1 identifies report processing
responsibilities. In addition, public accountants audit nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities and
issue reports following policy in AFPD 65-3. Chapter 6 contains information on public
accountant audits and reports of NAF activities.
2.2. Audit Process. AFAA uses an audit process that attempts to make the most efficient and
effective use of audit resources. Prior to announcing an audit, AFAA conducts substantial
preliminary research to identify appropriate audit subjects that AFAA includes in a plan it
provides to management annually. The process permits flexibility and timely adjustment of audit
requirements due to changes in Air Force policy and emphasis.
     2.2.1. Audit Phases. Each audit consists of three phases: research, application, and report
     processing. The research phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives
     and thoroughly plan the audit. The research phase culminates with development of the audit
     program which provides the analytical methodology for a thorough examination designed to
     disclose deficiencies and their underlying causes and effect. During the application phase,
     auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit results and provide a basis for specific
     recommendations. At the conclusion of field work, the AFAA prepares a draft report that
     presents identified audit results and recommendations so management can take appropriate
     corrective actions without the need for further review or study. AFAA releases the draft
     report to management for formal comments. After receiving the management comments,
     AFAA adds them to the final report, along with an AFAA evaluation, and distributes the
     final report. Designated activities formally track the final report until management indicates
     it has implemented all the agreed-to actions. Follow-up audits determine whether actions
     taken by management corrected cited deficiencies.
     2.2.2. Deconflicting Audits. Before starting each audit, AFAA first determines if conducting
     the audit would adversely affect the units involved. AFAA will defer the audit start or select
     other locations when the unit is experiencing significant operational demands (i.e.,
     deployments, exercises, or inspections) and conducting the audit would inflict unusual
     workload demands. Deconflicting audits is accomplished through coordination between
     AFAA and the base, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Air National Guard (ANG) management.
     NOTE: Throughout the remainder of this instruction, MAJCOM is used as a collective term
     to denote “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and ANG.”
     2.2.3. Audit Limitation. Internal audits do not criticize responsible management decisions.
     Most management decisions involve some degree of risk and uncertainty. Even when later
     events show the wrong decision was made, this, by itself, does not mandate an audit report.
     Unsuccessful decisions become subject to audit when they result in inefficient operations,
     inadequate procedures, or other deficiencies and when reporting them would lead to
     improving systems, procedures, or avoiding future errors.

2.3. Types of Reports.
   2.3.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA Air Force-level audit reports are the result of
   centrally managed, single or multi-site, audits that the AFAA addresses to the Secretariat, Air
   Staff, or MAJCOM. AFAA also provides these reports to SAF/FM for tracking
   recommendations and to the Department of Defense Inspector General (DoDIG) for
   information. The AFAA issues two types of Air Force-level reports: standard and interim.
      2.3.1.1. Standard Report. The standard report represents the normal reporting vehicle for
      conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
      2.3.1.2. Interim Report. AFAA issues interim reports (a) when audit results require
      prompt management attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction) or (b) to convey
      the audit status for a lengthy audit (preliminary). The interim report provides
      management an opportunity to initiate early corrective actions on identified findings and
      for AFAA to acknowledge those actions in the audit report.
   2.3.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA installation-level audit reports usually result from
   single-site audits covering issues specific to an activity or installation. The AFAA issues
   two types of installation-level reports: regular standard and interim.
      2.3.2.1. Standard Report. The standard report is the most commonly issued installation-
      level report. AFAA area audit offices use standard reports to convey the results of
      installation-level audits.
      2.3.2.2. Interim Report. AFAA area audit offices issue interim reports for the reasons
      cited in paragraph 2.3.1.2.
2.4. Draft Report Processing. The AFAA sends draft reports to tenant, installation, DRU,
FOA, MAJCOM, Air Staff, or Secretariat officials, as appropriate, for comments. Chapter 1
provides a list of responsibilities for processing draft Air Force-level reports.
   2.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA simultaneously distributes draft reports to the
   Secretariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM OPR and applicable OCRs.
   2.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA distributes each draft report to the designated
   unit audit focal point who forwards it to the functional OPR for comment. The audit focal
   point acts as a liaison officer between management and AFAA and monitors audit project
   and report processes, including follow-up tracking. AFAA provides installation-level reports
   to the appropriate commander and to other units having oversight authority (e.g., MAJCOM).
2.5. Management Comments. Management will respond in writing to all draft audit reports
containing recommendations or potential monetary benefits (PMBs). Reference for potential
responses. AFAA includes management comments verbatim, along with an audit evaluation, in
the final report. The management OPR and AFAA auditors will coordinate closely so the final
report fully documents management’s position on issues in the report including specific
concurrence with the PMB amount when applicable.             Note: Management may verbally
coordinate on reports that do not contain recommendations or PMB.
   2.5.1. Comment Requirements. Management comments are included verbatim in the final
   report. As a result, management comments could be released to the public as part of the final
   report in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Management will write
   comments concisely and include:
10                                                                 AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014


     2.5.1.1. A statement of concurrence          or   nonconcurrence    on   each    finding,
     recommendation, and PMB amount.
     2.5.1.2. Appropriate comments describing intended or completed corrective actions and
     an actual or estimated completion date for each corrective action. If corrective actions
     will take longer than a year to complete, the management comments should contain
     interim milestones for completing major segments or action.
     2.5.1.3. The management OPR’s rationale for any disagreements.
     2.5.1.4. Comments on the reasonableness of all auditor-estimated PMB amount. See
     Chapter 5 for further information on PMB. Note: When management corrects
     deficiencies during the audit, the draft report normally presents the findings and
     recognizes management's actions in lieu of a recommendation. If the report contains
     PMB, management must still comment on the reasonableness of the PMB estimate. If
     PMB is to be determined, state the factors that will affect the PMB determination.
  2.5.2. Suspense Dates. For reports with recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows
  management 30 calendar days from the date of the draft report to provide written comments.
  For interim reports, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days. For reports with
  no recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days to
  provide a response.
     2.5.2.1. The AFAA can grant extensions for management comments in unusual
     circumstances. If management cannot respond by the due date, the management OPR
     telephones or e-mails the AFAA and requests an extension. AFAA can grant extensions,
     usually in 15-day increments.
     2.5.2.2. For oral requests exceeding 15 days from the original suspense date, the
     management OPR will follow up with a written request that includes both the reasons for
     the delay and a date when AFAA can expect to get management comments.
  2.5.3. Potential Responses. The following list provides potential responses to audit
  recommendations. See Attachment 2 for specific examples of management comments.
     2.5.3.1. If management agrees with the findings, recommendations, and PMB amount,
     the management comments will describe corrective actions, both taken or planned, and
     give actual or planned completion dates. Planned completion dates should be at least 60
     days from the date comments are provided. Reference paragraph A2.1.
     2.5.3.2. If management agrees with the findings and agrees action is required but not the
     actions recommended in the report, management can concur with intent and propose
     other ways to correct the reported deficiencies. The response must explain what action
     management will take to correct the problem. AFAA evaluates the responses and does
     not consider such responses as nonresponsive if the alternative action would correct the
     problem. Reference paragraph A2.2.
     2.5.3.3. If management agrees with the findings and recommendations but disagrees with
     the PMB amount, management must clearly state the reason for disagreement and give a
     revised PMB estimate. If management disagrees there will be any PMB, the AFAA will
     elevate the entire amount as a nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter
     3. If management agrees there will be a PMB, but specifies a lesser amount, the AFAA
AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014                                                                           11


       will elevate only the difference between the management estimate and the AFAA
       estimate. Reference paragraph A2.3.
       2.5.3.4. If management nonconcurs with any finding, management comments should
       specify the reason for the nonconcurrence. The AFAA may elevate the nonconcurrence
       for resolution in accordance with Chapter 4. Reference paragraph A2.4.
       2.5.3.5. If management concurs with the finding but does not agree corrective actions are
       necessary, management should explicitly agree with the finding and explain the reason
       corrective actions are not appropriate. The AFAA audit team may elevate the
       nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter 4. Reference paragraph A2.5.
   2.5.4. Disagreements. Management will notify AFAA immediately if they disagree with any
   report finding, recommendation, or PMB. Management will meet with AFAA and explain
   their position on the points of disagreement or introduce new information. These discussions
   promote effective corrective action by clarifying audit findings, recommendations, and PMB.
   AFAA may revise the draft report after discussions with management.
2.6. Management Comments Evaluation. After management provides signed comments to
AFAA, the AFAA audit team will evaluate the comments to determine if they meet the
requirements of paragraph 2.5.1. and corrective actions, taken or proposed, are adequate and
timely. When management comments are not responsive or when management does not provide
comments within the required time, AFAA follows the procedures described in Chapter 4. When
management comments are responsive, the AFAA audit team inserts the comments and an
AFAA evaluation into the final report and distributes the report.
2.7. Revised Report Procedures. If, after issuing a draft report for comment, the audit
management team significantly revises the report (e.g. changes affect recommendation(s)), the
audit team will reissue the draft report for comment. AFAA will allow the report OPR an
appropriate amount of time to comment on the revised report, not to exceed 30 days.
   2.7.1. Air Force-Level Reports. SAF/AGA distributes copies of the revised draft Air Force-
   level report to the HQ USAF OPR and all other activities that received the initial draft report.
   2.7.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA team chief distributes the revised draft report
   to the unit audit focal point and other activities that received the initial draft report.
2.8. Final Report Distribution.
   2.8.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final reports to the report OPR. AFAA
   also prepares follow-up tracking sheets and forwards them to SAF/FMP. SAF/FMP
   personnel monitor and report on the implementation of corrective actions agreed to in Air
   Force-level audit reports.
   2.8.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final installation-level reports to
   responsible unit officials and to applicable MAJCOM audit focal points. Both the unit and
   MAJCOM audit focal points, in turn, track the recommendations and ensure management
   implements all agreed-to corrective actions.
 12                                                                  AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014


2.9. Report Availability. The draft report is an internal Air Force action document and is not
widely distributed. However, the final audit report is a historical document for use by internal
and external organizations. Within the Air Force, management and auditors use the final report
for reference. Outside the Air Force, government agencies such as the DoDIG, the Government
Accountability Office, and the Congress have access to the report. AFAA releases final reports
to the public, when requested, under the FOIA.
AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014                                                                        13


                                          Chapter 3

                               ACCESS TO INFORMATION

3.1. Overview. Air Force management grants AFAA auditors access to information according
to AFPD 65-3. This chapter provides guidance for resolving access-related disagreements.
3.2. Elevation of Disagreements.
   3.2.1. If management denies access for an installation-level audit, the auditor will send
   written notice to the AFAA MAJCOM representative who attempts to resolve the issue with
   the MAJCOM OPR. If discussions with the MAJCOM OPR do not result in access to
   requested information within 10 work days of the disagreement, the AFAA representative
   forwards the request and the MAJCOM position to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
   3.2.2. If management denies access for an Air Force-level audit and the AFAA directorate
   does not resolve the issue, the applicable Assistant Auditor General forwards the request and
   the results of any discussions to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
3.3. HQ USAF Discussions. SAF/AGA refers access disagreements to the HQ USAF OPR for
review and possible resolution. If these discussions do not resolve the problem within 20
calendar days of the disagreement, SAF/AGA refers the request, along with MAJCOM and HQ
USAF positions, to SAF/AG who submits the package to the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) for decision.
3.4. SECAF Decision. The SECAF makes a decision on the access denial within 30 calendar
days of the disagreement and advises applicable Air Force activities of the decision. In
accordance with provisions of DoDI 7600.02, Audit Policies, SECAF advises the DoDIG when
the SECAF denies access to AFAA auditors.
3.5. Access to Joint Staff Information. Requests for joint information should be coordinated
through AFAA and DoDIG. Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, the
Joint Staff must either provide access to the information or forward a recommendation for denial
to the Secretary of Defense for a determination within 30 calendar days.
 14                                                                   AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014


                                           Chapter 4

                       NONCONCURRENCES (DISAGREEMENTS)

4.1. Required Resolution. Air Force management and audit officials must resolve all
disagreements within 6 months of the final report date according to AFPD 65-4, Followup on
Internal Air Force Audit Reports and Liaison with External Audit Organizations. Management
and audit staff must try to resolve any disagreements at the lowest management level possible. If
they cannot resolve the problem, AFAA must move the issues to the next higher level of
authority, where they will discuss and resolve the disagreements.
4.2. Final Air Force-Level Reports with Disagreements. SAF/AGA refers final reports to
SAF/FMP for resolution whenever disagreements exist between the AFAA and management
officials. SAF/FMP submits final reports with unresolved issues to the Under Secretary of the
Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution. See AFI 65-403, Followup on Internal Air Force Audit
Reports, for additional information.
4.3. Nonconcurrences with Installation-Level Reports. If local auditors and management
officials disagree on matters in a report and they cannot resolve the disagreement, the auditors
will prepare and issue the final report containing management’s non-responsive comments and
an audit rebuttal. The auditors will send the report within 7 work days to the AFAA MAJCOM
representative for resolution with the MAJCOM functional OPR.
   4.3.1. The MAJCOM OPR will evaluate the audit and local management positions and
   provide written comments to the AFAA MAJCOM representative and installation officials
   within 60 calendar days explaining the MAJCOM position.
       4.3.1.1. When the MAJCOM supports the audit position, the OPR can, with AFAA
       representative concurrence, include proposed alternative actions to correct the problem.
       4.3.1.2. When the MAJCOM supports the management position, the AFAA
       representative will evaluate the MAJCOM position and either close out the disagreement
       or elevate it to SAF/AGA for resolution.
   4.3.2. When elevating a disagreement for resolution, the AFAA MAJCOM representative
   will send SAF/AGA a copy of the report, applicable management comments, the MAJCOM
   written position, and other information derived from previous resolution efforts within 90
   calendar days of the final report date. The AFAA MAJCOM representative will advise the
   MAJCOM OPR of this action.
   4.3.3. Working with HQ USAF, SAF/AGA may take an additional 90 calendar days to
   resolve the nonconcurrence. The SAF/AGA representative will evaluate the HQ USAF OPR
   position and either close out the nonconcurrence or elevate through SAF/FMP for a final
   decision.
   4.3.4. SAF/US is the final resolution authority. While SAF/US has delegated authority to
   decide nonconcurrences in installation-level issues to SAF/FMP, management or AFAA can
   appeal the SAF/FMP decision to SAF/US.
AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014                                                                           15


4.4. Late or Not Received Management Comments.
   4.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments for Air Force-
   level reports by the last revised due date, the AFAA audit team, in coordination with
   SAF/AGA and SAF/FMP, will contact the Air Force action officer to discuss (a) problems
   encountered, (b) the potential for resolution, and (c) the estimated date to receive signed
   comments. After 75 calendar days, the applicable Assistant Auditor General may get
   involved to resolve the problems delaying receipt of management comments. After 90
   calendar days, the AFAA may issue the final report without management comments and
   submit the report to SAF/FMP for resolution in accordance with paragraph 4.2.
   4.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments to the draft
   report within 30 calendar days, the AFAA audit team will meet with unit officials to
   determine the specific cause for the delay and, if appropriate, provide additional time for unit
   officials to prepare their response. If management comments are not received after 60
   calendar days, the AFAA should issue the final report without management comments and
   include the following statement in the Management’s Response section: “We advised
   management officials that if management comments are not received within 30 calendar days
   of the report date, we must elevate this audit report for resolution within the time periods
   prescribed in AFI 65-301.”
      4.4.2.1. If it becomes necessary to issue a final report without management comments,
      the MAJCOM OPR must act immediately to ensure the subordinate unit commander
      responds to the audit report. If the unit commander provides comments within 30
      calendar days after the final report date, AFAA will evaluate the comments. If the
      comments are responsive (either concurrences or nonconcurrences), AFAA will reissue
      the final report with the management comments and AFAA evaluation inserted. If the
      comments are not responsive, AFAA will send the comments to the AFAA MAJCOM
      Representative for resolution in accordance with paragraph 4.3. Concurrently, the unit
      audit focal point will provide the comments to the MAJCOM audit focal point to
      facilitate the resolution process.
      4.4.2.2. If the AFAA receives no comments within 30 calendar days following the final
      report date, the AFAA will, within 5 work days, elevate the report to the AFAA
      MAJCOM Representative for resolution. If not done previously, the unit audit focal
      point will elevate the report to the MAJCOM audit focal point for resolution.
 16                                                                     AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                           POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFITS

5.1. Definition. Potential monetary benefits:
   5.1.1. Are a reasonable estimate or an actual known benefit the AFAA measures and
   expresses as a dollar value and expects the DoD or the Federal Government overall to save if
   management implements audit recommendations.
   5.1.2. Represent the best estimate or an actual known amount at the time the auditor
   prepared the audit report.
   5.1.3. Can be either funds put to better use or questioned cost, but not both.
5.2. Funds Put to Better Use. Most PMB resulting from internal audit are classified as “funds
put to better use.” “Funds put to better use” means that if management implements the audit
recommendations, funds could be used more efficiently or effectively. The following list shows
examples of actions that result in “funds put to better use”:
   5.2.1. Reductions in outlays.
   5.2.2. Allowing funds from programs or operations to be deobligated and used in programs
   or operations other than that for which they were originally budgeted.
   5.2.3. Withdrawal of interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.
   5.2.4. Costs avoided by implementing recommended improvements for the operations of the
   establishment, a contractor, or a grantee.
   5.2.5. Avoiding unnecessary spending noted in pre-award reviews of contract or grant
   agreements.
   5.2.6. Reducing requirements with ongoing or planned procurement.
   5.2.7. Specifically identifying any other savings or cost reductions.
5.3. Questioned Cost. When an auditor questions an incurred cost because of one of the
following factors, it is known as “questioned cost”:
   5.3.1. An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative
   agreement, or other agreement or document that governs the expenditure of funds.
   5.3.2. A cost that, at the time of the audit, is not supported by adequate documentation.
   5.3.3. An expenditure of funds that is unnecessary or unreasonable for the intended purpose
   (applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
5.4. Disallowed Cost. When management, in a management decision, sustains or agrees a
questioned cost should not be charged to the government, it is known as a “disallowed cost”
(applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
5.5. Computation. Auditors compute potential monetary benefits from the most reasonable
data available. Actual monetary benefits are often impossible or impractical to determine.
Therefore, auditors base potential benefits on generally accepted principles, models, or formulas.
AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014                                                                           17


For example, AFAA auditors use the lower limit when expressing a single amount for a
statistically projected range of values.
   5.5.1. Monetary benefit computations include any appropriate offset costs. Offset costs
   include all direct or indirect costs incurred in implementing the action that will result in the
   monetary benefit.
   5.5.2. PMB can be one-time or annual. Annual benefits recur for an indefinite period of
   time, but AFAA limits computations to a 6-year period; that is, the current year plus five.
5.6. Coordination. During the normal draft report discussion period, AFAA personnel
coordinate PMB amounts of $50,000 or more with the audited organization and the funds owner,
if the PMB involves resources either owned by another organization or command, or funded and
controlled at another installation.
5.7. Summary of Audit Results (SAR) Statement. The AFAA attaches a SAR statement to
each draft report given to management. The SAR statement explains PMB of $50,000 or more.
For PMB claims exceeding $50,000, the amount included in the SAR statement will agree with
the amount in the report.
5.8. Management Response.
   5.8.1. Management can agree or disagree with the estimated PMB in reports of audit.
   However, management should not disagree with the audit estimate solely to defer the
   decision until actual benefits materialize.
   5.8.2. Management must comment on the reasonableness of the auditor's estimate and must
   justify disagreements with evidence that supports an alternate estimate.
5.9. Reporting Potential Monetary Benefits. AFAA includes all reported PMB exceeding
$50,000 in the Semi-Annual Report to the Congress and the Follow-up Status Report.
 18                                                                    AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014


                                           Chapter 6

                           NONAPPROPRIATED FUND AUDITS

6.1. Nonappropriated Fund Audit Requirements.
   6.1.1. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) arranges for annual financial audits of
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) with annual revenues or expenses
   exceeding $10 million. Activities in Program Group VI – Special Purpose Central Funds,
   and NAFIs supporting highly sensitive operations are not subject to this audit requirement.
   Instead, in order to maintain integrity of financial records, annual financial audits shall be
   conducted, regardless of the dollar threshold of revenues and expenses, for Special Purpose
   Central Funds and those NAFIs with operations deemed to be highly sensitive. The DoDIG
   must approve exceptions to these audit requirements. In accordance with AFI 52-105,
   Volume 2, Chapel Tithes and Offering Fund (CTOF), the HQ AFPC does not provide
   oversight of the CTOF. Therefore, the CTOF does not fall under the purview of the
   instruction.
   6.1.2. Annual audits are also required for highly sensitive situations, such as potential fraud
   or large public exposure. Other audits, as deemed necessary by management and the Air
   Force Services Audit Committee (paragraph 6.2.), are conducted based on assessed risk and
   resource availability.
   6.1.3. ANG NAF activities that are properly approved, operated in accordance with ANG
   regulations, and receive no appropriated fund support need not undergo an audit by federal
   entities or audits contracted by those entities.
6.2. Air Force Services Audit Committee. The Air Force will establish and maintain an audit
committee made up of senior officials independent of NAF management to oversee audits of
NAF activities. The audit committee shall establish requirements for all NAF audits and base the
requirements upon the application of risk assessments. The Auditor General of the Air Force or
their representative will serve as an advisor to the audit committee, but shall not be part of the
committee.
6.3. Audit Coverage of Nonappropriated Fund Activities.
   6.3.1. Public Accountant Audits. Each year, NAFs are budgeted and approved for certified
   public accountant firms to audit Air Force NAF activities. The audit committee shall
   establish requirements and identify contract deliverables for the public accountant audits and
   assist in monitoring the conduct of financial statement audits. Certified public accountant
   audit responsibilities are listed in (Chapter 1, paragraph 1.3.).
   6.3.2. AFAA Audits. In addition to the public accountant audits, the AFAA performs audits
   of NAF activities. Much like the Air Force Inspector General and other appropriated fund
   organizations, AFAA is considered “oversight” and the use of AFAA is authorized to provide
   audit support to NAF activities. Moreover, audit is a necessary component of oversight to
   ensure Air Force resources are properly and efficiently used to support NAF activities.
   Accordingly, AFAA “oversight” audits will be performed without NAF reimbursement. The
   AFAA:
AFI65-301 4 JUNE 2014                                                                           19


       6.3.2.1. Does not have internally or externally established NAF limits of audit coverage.
       The AFAA schedules and performs NAF audits as deemed appropriate.
       6.3.2.2. Includes Air Force-wide system and functional reviews of NAF activities in the
       AFAA annual audit plan when appropriate.
       6.3.2.3. Includes installation-level audits of NAF activities in area audit office annual
       audit plans, based on audit priorities.
       6.3.2.4. Notifies AFPC of planned audits on NAF activities to avoid duplicate audits.
       6.3.2.5. Provides copies of installation-level reports on NAF activities to the installation
       audit focal point, AFPC/FM; SAF/FMCEB; Air Force Personnel Center, Installation
       Support Division (AFPC/SVI); Air Force Personnel Center, Nonappropriated Fund
       Financial Management (AFPC/FMN); and the applicable MAJCOM audit focal point.
       6.3.2.6. Should be used for audits of NAF activities involving suspected fraud and other
       serious improprieties rather than public accountants.
6.4. Audits of Private Organizations. The Air Force does not provide appropriated funds,
NAFs, or personnel supported by these funds to audit private organizations such as museum
foundations, thrift shops, Air Force Aid Societies, scouting groups, spouses’ clubs, and
auxiliaries on Air Force installations, unless authorized by the SECAF. Private Organizations
registered through Air Force installations must maintain financial controls in accordance with
AFI 34-223, Private Organization Program. When indications of fraud or other improprieties
exist, regardless of the amount of revenues, the commander can request an AFAA audit to
protect Air Force interest.
6.5. Processing Public Accountant Reports. The Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA)
program requires public accountants to issue a separate report for each audit.
   6.5.1. Reporting Level. The PACA program requires public accountants to prepare and
   distribute NAF activity reports based on the terms of the contract.
       6.5.1.1. When findings and recommendations are system-wide or procedural, public
       accountants consolidate installation-level audit results and issue a report to AFPC which
       will work with the appropriate oversight board or committee to correct any deficiencies.
       6.5.1.2. Public accountants should promptly report any findings that suggest irregular
       conduct or the possibility of fraud to SAF/FMCEB, AFPC/FM, and the installation’s
       servicing Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.
   6.5.2. Management Comments. Commanders of audited activities prepare management
   comments for each finding and recommendation in the audit report and give them to the
   public accountant firm within 35 calendar days (50 days for overseas) from the date they
   receive the draft audit report.
   6.5.3. Evaluation of Management Comments. In the installation-level report, public
   accountants evaluate the responsiveness and adequacy of management comments for each

   control weaknesses, findings, and recommendations that public accountants identify during
   audits to FSS Commanders/Division Chiefs within the Air Force.
   6.5.6. Resolution of Nonconcurrences. SAF/FM works with AFPC and the appropriate
   oversight board or committee to resolve disagreements with findings or recommendations in
   public accountant audit reports that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM level. If SAF/FM
   cannot resolve the disagreements, they follow policy in AFPD 65-4. The resolution period is
   6 months from the date the public accountant issues the report.
6.6. Processing Air Force Audit Agency Audit Reports. AFAA addresses, processes, and
distributes reports on NAF activities according to the requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of this
instruction. AFAA reports on NAF activities receive management follow-up attention as
specified in AFPD 65-4.
