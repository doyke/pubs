                                            Chapter 1

                            POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction. A JTAC is a qualified (certified) Service member who, from a forward
position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in close air support and other offensive air
operations. A qualified and current JTAC will be recognized across the Department of Defense
as capable and authorized to perform terminal attack control (JP 3-09.3, Change 1).
Standardized training ensures all JTACs are capable of providing effective air control for all
counterland operations, particularly Close Air Support (CAS). The complexity of integrating
CAS with fire support and maneuver units requires a detailed understanding of air and space
power. This instruction provides the minimum training required for personnel to attain/maintain
JTAC Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status. Air Force JTACs meet all of the requirements
outlined in the JTAC MOA and Joint Publication 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS).
1.2. Policies. This instruction provides guidance for conducting a JTAC Training program that
will complement AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. The unit’s JTAC training program
is governed by this AFI, and may be supplemented in an operating instruction (OI). The unit’s
JTAC training program may be included in the training OI developed in accordance with AFI
13-113 Volume 1, Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Training Program, AFI 13-114, Volume
1, Air Support Operations Center Training Program, or in an OI developed separately. Group
commanders may combine group and squadron training functions/responsibilities into one unit
OI when practical. The unit’s training program must be tailored to meet the unit’s Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) statement, and probable contingency taskings outside of those
missions identified in the unit’s DOC statement. It should be conducted in conjunction with joint
training exercises to the maximum extent possible.
   1.2.1. JTAC Training Program. Training objectives must balance the need for realism
   against the expected threat when executing JTAC mission essential tasks. Applying Air
   Force flight/ground safety standards is paramount during the conduct of JTAC training.
   1.2.2. JTAC Training Missions. Units will design JTAC training missions to: achieve
   combat capability in mission tasks, enhance mission accomplishment, and comply with
   safety standards.
       1.2.2.1. During training, JTACs will use applicable tactics, techniques, and procedures to
       develop realistic training scenarios (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication
       procedures, combat tactics, tactical deception and concealment, threat reactions,
       intelligence briefings/debriefings, and Battle Damage Assessment [BDA] reports).
       1.2.2.2. To the maximum extent practical, all training will include the use of live, inert or
       training ordnance, artillery and mortar fire support, threat simulators, countermeasures,
       and target marking techniques.
       1.2.2.3. During Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and Continuation Training (CT)
       units (non-Air Force Special Operations Command [AFSOC]) must use the Theater Air
       Control Training Information Computer System (TACTICS) to satisfy academic, testing
       and task evaluation requirements when the academic training module is available on the
 6                                                          AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008


        system (T-3). See Chapter 8 for specific TACTICS information. If the TACTICS lesson
        module is not completed and posted on the TACTICS website, the unit must
        create/maintain those JTAC lesson plans (T-3).
     1.2.3. The academic training portion of JTAC training may be provided by any individual
     with expertise in that subject with approval by the unit commander or their designated
     representative.
     1.2.4. If JTAC trainees are controlling live-fly aircraft, a current and qualified Joint
     Terminal Attack Controller - Instructor (JTAC-I) must be physically located with the
     trainee and be capable of immediately assuming direct control of the aircraft if necessary (T-
     0). JTAC-Is directly supervising JTAC trainees in IQT or MQT may count up to two of
     these controls (to include night, live and laser controls) toward the JTAC-I’s currency
     requirement per 6 month period.
     1.2.5. The JTAC-I or JTAC responsible for the control, must conduct a thorough risk
     assessment if attack aircraft are going to deliver expendable ordnance (live/inert/training),
     using AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools (T-3).
     1.2.6. Personnel Authorized to Perform JTAC Duties. Table 1.1. lists all Air Force
     personnel authorized to perform JTAC duties, these personnel must meet the requirements of
     this instruction as stated:

       1.2.8.2. Monthly look-back. All units will conduct a review at the end of each month to
       identify JTACs who have not completed at least two terminal attack controls (utilizing
       live-fly aircraft or an ACC-approved simulator) within the last 90 days, and/or whose
       currency (minimum of six live-fly controls within the past six months and at least two
       controls in the last 90 days) will expire within the upcoming month (see paragraph 5.1)
       (T-3). If an individual fails to meet training requirements, see paragraph 4.2
    1.2.9. JTAC control. A JTAC control must include a complete tactical mission scenario (T-
    1). A JTAC control begins with a CAS briefing (the 9-line is the JP 3-09.3 standard) from a
    JTAC and ends with an actual/simulated weapons release or an abort on a final attack run (T-
    0). No more than two controls can be counted per CAS briefing per target (T-0). Re-attacks
    on a target do not count as controls.
       1.2.9.1. CAS control example: A JTAC who controls a 2-ship of A-10s onto a target and
       issues a “cleared hot” call to each aircraft, earns 2 controls. If the JTAC provides a new
       briefing for a new target to those same 2 aircraft and issues each aircraft a “cleared hot”
       call he would earn 2 more controls.
    1.2.10. Training Extensions. Unit commanders can grant an individual one 30-day extension
    in JTAC MQT (T-3). Group commanders can grant a second 30-day extension (T-3). The
    first O-6 in the MAJCOM TACP or Combat Control Functional Manager’s chain of
    command is authorized to grant a third 30-day extension or request a waiver (T-2). After the
    third extension, the upgrading JTAC’s training records will be reviewed and the individual
    will be assessed by the unit commander to determine whether they will continue JTAC
    upgrade training (T-3). Individuals determined capable of continuing JTAC upgrade training
    must restart the IQT training process with unit commander approval (T-2). Commanders of
    individuals determined to lack the appropriate skill or abilities to continue JTAC upgrade
    training will remove the individual’s AFSC and recommend the individual for retraining or
    separation IAW AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen (T-3). Commanders
    should consult with the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) before proceeding with any action
    to separate an individual.
    1.2.11. Training adjustments, removal, and re-entry. For JTAC MQT, commanders may
    adjust the training time or remove personnel from JTAC MQT training due to PCS,
    deployments, medical disqualification, emergency leave, or disciplinary action (T-3). JTAC
    IQT/MQT requirements will not be reduced because of a training adjustment or removal (T-
    3).
       1.2.11.1. For MQT, unit commanders can adjust training time a maximum of 30 days
       based on an individual’s TDY or emergency leave for 30 cumulative days (3 Unit
       Training Assemblies [UTA] for ANG) or more (T-3). For CT, unit training managers in
       coordination with the supervisor and Chief JTAC-I can adjust academic training due
       dates a maximum of 30 days based on an individual’s TDY or emergency leave for 30
       cumulative days (3 Unit Training Assemblies [UTA] for ANG) or more (T-3). Personnel
       who are TDY for 30 consecutive days or 3 UTAs or more will continue to accomplish
       training at temporary locations where JTAC MQT or CT is available (T-3). The
       supervisor or Training Manager (TM), following coordination with the Chief JTAC-I,
       will document adjustments on an AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record -
AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                    9


     Continuation Sheet to be placed in part V of the individual’s JTAC training and
     evaluation folder (T-3).
     1.2.11.2. Training removal and re-entry. For JTAC MQT, commanders may remove
     personnel from JTAC training for up to 365 days (T-3). Individuals who are removed
     from MQT training in excess of 365 days will re-accomplish all JTAC training beginning
     with JTAC IQT (see Chapter 2) (T-3). Individuals will only count training items which
     were accomplished within the last 180 days upon re-entry into JTAC MQT training (T-3).
     Commanders must approve in writing, an individual’s removal and re-entry into JTAC
     MQT training on an AF Form 623A to be placed in the individuals JTAC training folder
     (T-3). For JTAC CT, Individuals must follow the guidance outlined in Para 4.2.2 (T-3).
  1.2.12. Unit-specific JTAC training requirements incorporated into the unit’s OI will be
  forwarded to the group TM and Chief JTAC-I for approval by the group commander (T-3).
  Group Chief JTAC-Is will assist subordinate units to ensure all required areas of training and
  qualifications are addressed. The unit’s training OI will, as a minimum, address the
  following items (T-3):
     1.2.12.1. Training documentation and assessment responsibilities and procedures.
     1.2.12.2. Additional JTAC MQT and CT requirements unique to each unit as
     appropriate.
     1.2.12.3. Work center/duty position Master Task Listings applicable to JTAC operations.
     1.2.12.4. Terminal Attack Control mission log management.
     1.2.12.5. Risk Assessment Program in accordance with AFPAM 90-803 Risk
     Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.
  1.2.13. CAS Practical Exercise (PE). A CAS mission PE is a comprehensive training
  event that includes all areas of mission planning, coordination, and execution but does not
  involve control of actual aircraft. CAS mission PEs are rehearsals/simulations that allow
  trainees to demonstrate the skills associated with correct use of tactics, techniques and
  procedures during various types of CAS control.
     1.2.13.1. A CAS mission PE is a tactical scenario that occurs on any given range, or
     within a defined area of responsibility. Each CAS mission PE could have several
     different outcomes/training objectives based on the instructor inputs. This will provide
     instant feedback by the instructor to the trainee in those areas needing improvement.
     Instructors will use actual mission profiles and mission-related information to familiarize
     the trainee with what to expect during all phases of mission execution. Instructors will:
         1.2.13.1.1. Conduct CAS PEs prior to controlling missions that will include
         procedures and/or tactics that individuals are not qualified for (e.g., laser, night) (T-
         3).
         1.2.13.1.2. Use CAS PEs to familiarize individuals with local ranges, aligned
         Operations Plans, or other training areas as designated by the Chief JTAC-I and unit
         commander (T-3).
     1.2.13.2. At a minimum, the CAS PE will consist of mission planning, coordination,
     execution, briefing, controlling, and debriefing using a unit developed scenario (T-3).

       1.2.13.3. Document CAS PE control on ACC Form 206, Individual Mission Gradesheet
       (Figure 1.1 and 1.2) when completing a graded terminal attack control mission for a
       prospective JTAC (T-3). File it in the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder
       (T-3).
   1.2.14. JTAC Safety
       1.2.14.1. All personnel will wear approved laser-safe goggles when conducting laser
       operations (T-1).
       1.2.14.2. JTACs and personnel collocated with JTACs will wear helmets, body armor
       and any additional personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by range procedures
       and OIs when conducting live terminal attack controls (T-1).
       1.2.14.3. Helmets and body armor must be of the type that will mitigate the effects of
       fragmentary ordnance associated with aerial delivered weapons (T-1).
   1.2.15. Non-USAF JTAC-Is. Mission Ready Forward Air Controllers (FAC) and non-
   USAF JTACs assigned as formal schoolhouse instructors will meet the requirements in
   Chapter 7 (see para 7.4.9.) from this AFI, as well as receive a JTAC and JTAC-I evaluation
   IAW AFI13-112v2 before performing instructor duties for USAF Qualification Course
   trainees.

1.4. Deployments. Individuals deploying to fill a JTAC requirement must deploy CMR for the
duty position they are tasked to support for that deployment (i.e. JTAC, ALO) (T-0).
     1.4.1. CMR JTACs who are deployed to a combatant command in support of contingency
     operations do not have to maintain currency and CT requirements for the duration of the
     deployment (T-1). All JTACs who do not maintain currency and CT requirements are
     considered Non-CMR upon completion of the deployment, and must regain CMR status
     upon return to home station IAW Chapter 4 (T-0).
     1.4.2. Units are encouraged to take advantage of any training opportunities that become
     available. Document all training and JTAC missions, to include combat controls, completed
     during the deployment (T-3). Training to regain CMR status will begin on the individual’s
     first duty day after the authorized reconstitution period (T-0).
1.5. Supplements. This instruction may be supplemented in order to provide specific guidance
to subordinate units. The parent MAJCOM Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) must
approve all group-level supplements (T-2). AF/A3O-AC will coordinate prior to publication on
all MAJCOM supplements. MAJCOM OPRs will forward all approved supplements to the other
MAJCOMs within 30 days of publication. The NGB will provide a copy of any approved
supplements to their gaining MAJCOM.
     1.5.1. CMR JTACs who are deployed to a combatant command in support of contingency

                      JTAC INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. JTAC IQT is the process to train a JTAC in basic controller duties without regard
to the unit’s mission. IQT is attendance at a Joint Fire Support Executive Steering Committee
(JFS ESC) accredited, formal JTAC training school (schoolhouse). USAF JTAC schoolhouses
will, upon student arrival and prior to beginning classes, verify that students have met all
prerequisites IAW this AFI (T-1). IQT is complete after the prospective JTAC successfully
completes a JFS ESC accredited training course. Upon completion of JTAC IQT, the JTAC
begins MQT (see Chapter 3). JTAC-Is will document all controls in JTAC IQT using an ACC
Form 206 (T-3).
   2.1.1. Prerequisites for entry into JTAC IQT. The following requirements must be
   met/accomplished prior to an individual attending a formal JTAC qualification course:
       2.1.1.1. Prospective JTACs who are officers must possess a minimum 1-skill level in
       AFSC 13CX and 13LXX or be an aircrew member ALO with one year of operational
       flying experience (T-3). Enlisted personnel must possess a minimum 3-skill level in
       AFSC 1C4X1 or a 5-skill level in AFSC 1C2X1 (USAF only) (T-3). Note: Non-USAF
       individuals must possess the operational or mission ready experience required by the
       JTAC MOA.
          2.1.1.1.1. Upon approval from unit commander, 13L and 1C4X1 personnel are
          authorized to enter IQT any time after date assigned to first duty station, but must
          enter IQT no later than 18 months from date assigned to first duty station (T-3).
          2.1.1.1.2. Personnel in AFSC 1C4X1 must complete the following prior to
          enrollment into IQT; table 4.1 from AFI13-113 Volume 1, Tactical Air Control Party
          (TACP) Training Program, career development course end of course exam, and all 5
          level core tasks from CFETP 1C4X1 (T-3).
       2.1.1.2. All items listed as prerequisites in Table 2.1. will be accomplished using the
       TACTICS modules (for non-AFSOC units) or unit approved training plan (for AFSOC
       units) (T-3). Successful completion of prerequisite training requires passing of both the
       academic and task evaluation portions of the module (T-0).
       2.1.1.3. Individuals must read and be able to identify relationships of basic facts, and
       state general principles about the subject matter in the documents below (T-3). See
       References section in Attachment 1 for publication webpage addresses:
       2.1.1.4. Individuals must read and be able to identify relationships of basic facts, and
       state general principles about the subject matter in the documents below. See References

   2.1.2. Following completion of all prerequisites, commanders will annotate approved entry
   into IQT utilizing AF Form 797 (Figure 2.2) (T-3). See paragraph 1.2.6. for individuals
   authorized to perform JTAC duties. Failure to bring this required documentation will result
   in disenrollment from the course following coordination with the TACP or Combat Control
   Functional Manager at the MAJCOM responsible for that JTAC Qualification Course
   (JTACQC) (T-2).
   2.1.3. A minimum of 12 successful graded controls must be completed between entry into
   IQT and the completion of MQT (minimum of 8 in IQT) and will include the following (see
   paragraph 2.2.3. for required simulation controls) (T-0):
       2.1.3.1. 10 controls must be fixed-wing controls (includes up to 2 bomber controls and 1
       Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) control but no AC-130 controls) (T-0)
       2.1.3.2. Minimum of 4 controls must expend live or training ordnance (T-0).
       2.1.3.3. Minimum of 2 controls must be at night (The use of a ground based night vision
       device and compatible target marking device are highly desirable) (T-0).
       2.1.3.4. Minimum of 1 control must employ a ground based laser target designator (T-0).
       2.1.3.5. All controls will be Type 1 or 2 with a minimum of one Type 2 and a maximum
       of six Type 2 controls (T-0).
       2.1.3.6. Minimum of one day or night control with the support of a FAC(A) during a
       practical exercise, simulator, or live-fly terminal attack control (T-0).
       2.1.3.7. Minimum of four non-permissive controls (T-0). Non-permissive is a control
       where the target area threat level dictates aircraft must maintain stand-off distances prior
       to target attack run. Must use a tactical scenario which requires a full nine line CAS brief
       (IP to target area).
       2.1.3.8. Minimum of one control using digitally aided Close Air Support (DACAS)
       system (e.g. TACP-CASS). This control may be accomplished with live-fly aircraft,
       simulated aircraft during a practical exercise, or with an accredited simulator (T-3).
Note: One or more of the above requirements may be completed in one control (i.e. live and
laser) however, this combination only counts for 1 of the 12 total controls required. A JTACs
first 90 day lookback will be 90 days following his initial certification (see paragraph 5.1.).
   2.1.4. USAF JTACs attending a USAF JTAC Schoolhouse (i.e. 6 CTS, USAFE AGOS) will
   have their JTAC training and evaluation folder created by the Schoolhouse (T-3). USAF
   JTACs attending other Service/Country JTAC School, units will need to coordinate with that
   school and may need to create a folder prior to school attendance (T-3).
   2.1.5. JTAC Schoolhouses will provide a written report listing all training that was
   accomplished and, as necessary, a deficiency letter listing any required training that was not
 22                                                                      AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008


    accomplished to include the reason why the training was not accomplished (T-0). Training
    deficiency letters will contain the standard used to measure successful completion of each
    task and associated references (T-0).
2.2. JTAC IQT Training.
    2.2.1. Prospective JTACs must successfully complete all IQT requirements listed in Table
    2.1. and in this chapter (T-0). Any IQT requirements not completed during JTACQC must
    be accomplished within 45 days (90 for ANG) of the course completion date (T-3).
         2.2.1.1. As circumstances permit, tasks listed as MQT requirements in Table 2.1. may be
         completed at the formal JTAC schoolhouse. These tasks do not have to be
         reaccomplished during the MQT phase of training.
    2.2.2. Each academic training task will require successful completion of an examination (80
    percent minimum to pass) (T-0). Use testing to validate qualification to the maximum extent
    possible throughout the training program (T-0).
    2.2.3. Successfully complete a minimum of four graded terminal attack controls in the JTAC
    Training and Rehearsal System (Indirect-Forward Air Controller Trainer [I-FACT] or ACC-
    approved simulator) (T-3). If an approved simulator is not available, the use of live-fly
    aircraft or CAS Practical Exercises is authorized (T-3).
    2.2.4. File all training material for the prospective JTAC in the individual’s JTAC training
    and evaluation folder, to include grade sheets completed during the formal training course(s)
    (T-3).
    2.2.5. Individuals who fail to successfully complete a JFS ESC approved JTACQC due to
    academic failure or non-progression, two times, will be considered for removal from the
    career field (T-3). Unit commanders must review the requirements of the Air Force Enlisted
    Classification Directory and take the appropriate action.

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. JTAC MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify
JTACs in specific duty position(s) and controller duties required to perform unit assigned
missions. MQT builds upon training received during IQT. Unit JTAC MQT programs require
Group approval (T-3). Completion of JTAC MQT is a prerequisite for JTAC CMR status (T-0).
Note: All controls in JTAC MQT will be graded using an ACC Form 206 (T-3).
   3.1.1. JTAC MQT requirements are listed in Table 2.1 Tasks listed as MQT requirements
   that are accomplished during the formal JTAC qualification course do not need to be
   reaccomplished during MQT. Base the unit’s JTAC MQT program on the unit’s DOC
   statement (may include forecasted contingency missions not identified in the unit’s DOC
   statement) (T-3). Training will be documented on AF IMT 797 (or unit approved automated
   products) and maintained in the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder (T-3).
      3.1.1.1. Training tasks will be accomplished to the standards listed in Table 2.1.
      Successful completion of required TACTICS modules requires passing of both the
      academic and task evaluation portions of the module (T-3).
   3.1.2. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the unit’s mission
   as determined by the unit commander (T-3). This training will be identified in the unit’s
   applicable OI that governs its individual JTAC training program (T-3).
3.2. Initial JTAC MQT.
   3.2.1. Prospective JTACs must complete Initial JTAC MQT within 180 days (T-3). Timing
   starts upon successful completion of the JFS ESC accredited formal training school. JTACS
   who exceed 180 days in MQT must have training time extended/adjusted IAW paragraphs
   1.2.10. and 1.2.11. to continue in training (T-3).
   3.2.2. Prospective JTACs must successfully complete a minimum of four graded terminal
   attack controls in the I-FACT or ACC-approved simulator (T-3). Training will be
   documented on an ACC Form 206 (T-3). If an approved simulator is not available, the use of
   live-fly aircraft or CAS Practical Exercises is authorized.
   3.2.3. Initial JTAC MQT consists of the number and type of successful graded terminal
   attack controls not accomplished in IQT IAW Table 2.1. and paragraph 2.1.3. of this AFI (T-
   0). As necessary, prospective JTACs may accomplish more than the required minimum of
   12 successful graded terminal attack controls during JTAC IQT/MQT, to ensure they are
   fully prepared for formal evaluation.
   3.2.4. Upon completion of Initial JTAC MQT, the Chief JTAC-I will request a formal
   evaluation (IAW AFI 13-112, Volume 2) from the unit’s Stan/Eval section (T-3). Initial
   JTAC MQT is complete when the individual is recommended for a formal JTAC evaluation
   (T-3).
AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                   35

                     COMBAT MISSION READY REQUIREMENTS

4.1. JTAC CMR Status. JTAC CMR status is attained when an individual successfully
completes IQT and MQT, passes a formal JTAC evaluation as outlined in AFI 13-112, Volume 2
and has the unit commander’s certification (T-3). CMR JTACs are authorized to perform
unsupervised terminal attack controls.
   4.1.1. JTAC currency control requirements (identified in paragraph 5.3) may be allowed to
   lapse up to six months without loss of certification and/or regression to N-CMR status (T-3).
       4.1.1.1. JTACs will not lose control currency for failure to complete non-control events
       of Table 5.1. Those events include all items in table 5.1 with the exception of 5.9 series
       items.
   4.1.2. To regain currency, a JTAC must complete the following minimum items while under
   the supervision of a current CMR JTAC: (1) number and category of controls
   unaccomplished in the previous 90-day period and (2) number and category of controls
   unaccomplished in the previous 6-month period (T-3). The control(s) must be recorded as a
   “supervised control” in the individual‘s JTAC Mission Log (T-3). Upon completion of all
   requirements, the supervisor will sign a MFR or annotate an AF Form 623A and place it in
   the individual‘s JTAC training folder, stating the individual has regained their currency (T-
   3).
4.2. JTAC Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR) Status. JTACs will be placed on N-CMR
status if they (1) fail or are overdue an evaluation, (2) become non-current for greater than 6
months or (3) fail to comply with Table 1.1 (T-0). Note: JTACs who are N-CMR in excess of 60
consecutive months will re-accomplish all JTAC training beginning with IQT (see Chapter 2) (T-
2).
   4.2.1. When a JTAC is placed in N-CMR status, the unit commander will place a MFR or
   AF Form 623A entry in the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder, Part V (T-3).
       4.2.1.1. The commander will decertify a JTAC when it is determined that the individual
       JTAC lacks the appropriate skill or abilities required to continue controlling aircraft (T-
       3). This documentation becomes a permanent part of the individual’s JTAC training and
       evaluation folder. See paragraph 5.4. for details regarding JTAC decertification.
   4.2.2. JTACs placed in N-CMR status for overdue currency greater than six months must
   complete all required training identified in paragraph 5.2 and all terminal attack control
   requirements identified in paragraph 5.3 (T-0). Terminal attack controls must be
   accomplished under the supervision of a JTAC-I (T-3). Upon completion of all
   requirements, the unit commander will sign a MFR or annotate an AF Form 623A and place
   it in the individual‘s JTAC training folder, stating the individual has regained their CMR
   status (T-3). JTACs placed in N-CMR status for overdue evaluations fall into two categories,
   less than or equal to 6 months and greater than 6 months.
       4.2.2.1. JTACs who are N-CMR due to expired evaluations greater than 6 but less than
       60 consecutive months will accomplish the following (T-0):
36                                                      AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008


         4.2.2.1.1. Complete all lessons required for continuation training (Table 5.1) using
         TACTICS training modules for non-AFSOC units and unit training modules for
         AFSOC units (T-3). Successful completion of required training modules requires
         passing of both the academic and task evaluation portions of the module (T-3). Note:
         Units are allowed to tailor this portion of the program for these individuals based on
         prior qualification, experience, documented performance and formal training.
         4.2.2.1.2. Successfully complete a minimum of six graded terminal attack controls
         under supervision of a qualified JTAC-I (T-0). These six controls must include at
         least two Type 1 controls, two non-permissive controls, one Type 2 control, one
         control expending live or training ordnance, one control must be conducted at night
         and one control using a ground based laser (T-0). A JTACs first 90 day look back
         will be 90 days following his recertification (T-3). Note: One of the six terminal
         attack controls may be completed using bomber aircraft and three of the six controls
         must utilize fixed wing aircraft.
         4.2.2.1.3. Upon completion of the requirements in paragraph 4.2.2.1. of this
         instruction by the N-CMR JTAC, the Chief JTAC-I will request a formal evaluation
         (accomplished IAW AFI 13-112, Volume 2) from the unit’s Stan/Eval section (T-3).
         Following successful completion of the formal evaluation and certification by the unit
         commander, a JTAC regains his JTAC CMR status.
     4.2.2.2. Examples of regaining CMR status.
         4.2.2.2.1. Example 1. SSgt Smith is a N-CMR JTAC because his evaluation is 7
         months overdue. SSgt Smith has completed his academics in accordance with
         paragraph 5.2 and completed the terminal attack control requirements in accordance
         with paragraph 5.3. In this example, a MFR must be placed in SSgt Smith‘s JTAC
         evaluation folder stating SSgt Smith has completed his training, and the Chief JTAC-I
         recommends SSgt Smith for an evaluation (the statement must be signed by the Chief
         JTAC-I). Once the Chief JTAC-I recommends an evaluation, follow guidance in
         accordance with AFI 13-112 Volume 2.
         4.2.2.2.2. Example 2. SSgt Smith is a N-CMR JTAC because SSgt Smith’s
         evaluation is 8 months overdue. SSgt Smith completed only four controls in the last 6
         months, and two controls in the last 90 days. SSgt Smith has completed his academic
         in accordance with paragraph 5.2. In this example, SSgt Smith must accomplish 2
         more controls under the supervision of a JTAC-I. SSgt Smith must meet both 90-day
         and 6-month control requirements. A MFR must be placed in SSgt Smith‘s JTAC
         evaluation folder stating SSgt Smith has completed his training, and the Chief JTAC-I
         recommends SSgt Smith for an evaluation (the statement must be signed by the Chief
         JTAC-I). Once the Chief JTAC-I recommends an evaluation, follow guidance in
         accordance with AFI 13-112 Volume 2.
  4.2.3. JTACs who are N-CMR due to an overdue evaluation for a period less than or equal to
  6 consecutive months will accomplish the following (T-0):
     4.2.3.1. Complete academics in accordance with paragraph 5.2. JTACs must complete
     all required academic training prior to an evaluation for recertification.
AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                37


     4.2.3.2. Conduct 90-day and 6-month look-backs to ensure terminal attack control
     currency requirements have been accomplished. JTACs must complete all required
     terminal attack controls per paragraph 5.3 prior to an evaluation under the supervision of
     a JTAC-I.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 CONTINUATION TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines academic training, task performance, and terminal attack
control mission requirements for CMR JTACs. Units must identify local and/or mission specific
additional training requirements in the OI that governs their JTAC training program. JTAC
continuation training (CT) begins the date following the initial /requalification control-phase
evaluation. Initial annual CT requirements must be completed within 12 months of JTAC
continuation training start date (T-0). Initial semiannual CT training requirements must be
completed within 6 months of JTAC continuation training start date (T-0). Initial biennial CT
requirements must be completed within 24 months of JTAC continuation training start date (T-3).
Following initial JTAC certification/requalification, a JTAC must complete a minimum of two
CT controls within 90 days (utilizing live-fly aircraft or ACC-approved simulator) (T-3) and all
semi-annual CT requirements (6 controls of actual live-fly aircraft) within 180 days from the
date of the initial certification/requalification control-phase evaluation (T-0).
Note: Individuals using simulator controls to complete two CT controls every 90 days, may also
count these controls toward the completion of task 5.12 in Table 5.1.
Note: If an approved simulator is not available, the use of live-fly aircraft or CAS Practical
Exercises is authorized.
Note: Units will maintain JTAC IQT/MQT training records until all CT training requirements in
Table 5.1. are completed and documented for the first time.
   5.1.1. The number of terminal attack controls identified in this chapter is the minimum
   required for JTAC CT (T-0). JTAC CT includes JTAC training and unit-specific training
   that is required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. JTACs will complete all training
   requirements listed in Table 5.1. and this chapter in the specified training period unless an
   adjustment is approved IAW paragraph 1.2.11 JTACs that do not complete training within
   the specified training period, including adjustments, are N-CMR until all training items are
   completed (T-3).
5.2. Continuation Training Program. Table 5.1 lists the minimum JTAC CT academics and
tasks deemed critical and required for JTAC CT. Units will establish a training program to
satisfy additional JTAC CT requirements identified on unit master task lists (T-3). Performance
training tasks will have a task evaluation with a “go or No-Go” standard developed for that task
(T-3).
   5.2.1. Each academic training task will require successful completion of an examination (80
   percent minimum to pass) and/or performance test (T-3).
       5.2.1.1. Academic instructors will be JTAC-Is or those individuals identified in
       paragraph 1.2.3 (T-3).
       5.2.1.2. If a CMR JTAC has not completed JTAC CT for an academic event, or cannot
       attain the minimum measurement standard, the individual is N-CMR (T-3). The unit
       commander or designated official must make an entry into the individual’s JTAC training
       and evaluation folder (MFR or AF Form 623A) stating reason the member could not
       attain the standard (T-3). Individuals have 30 days to complete the retraining (T-3). If
AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                         39


       the individual cannot attain the standard after the 30 days, he is entered into JTAC N-
       CMR status IAW paragraph 4.2.1 (T-3). Unit commanders will determine the
       appropriate re-qualification program to return N-CMR JTACs to JTAC CMR standards
       and status (see paragraph 4.2.). Once the re-qualification program is complete, unit
       commanders will return JTACs to JTAC CMR status (T-3).
   5.2.2. JTAC continuation training will be documented on AF IMT 1098 (T-3).
5.3. Terminal Attack Control Requirements. See Table 5.1.
   5.3.1. Units with an accredited simulation device may replace a maximum of 2 live-fly CT
   controls per 6 month period (T-3). The following live-fly controls will not be replaced by
   simulation: three (3) fixed-wing, two (2) Type 1, one (1) Type 2, one (1) night, one (1)
   expenditure of live or training ordnance and two (2) Non-permissive controls (T-0).
   5.3.2. In order to maintain JTAC currency, JTACs must complete a minimum of two
   terminal attack controls every 90-days using a sliding calendar (see paragraph 1.2.8.2) (T-3).
   5.3.3. JTACs must conduct one terminal attack control every six months employing a
   ground laser designator T-0). The laser will be utilized throughout the weapon delivery or
   dry attack run to mark a target for an aircraft with a laser spot tracker. These controls may be
   accomplished with live-fly aircraft, simulated aircraft during a practical exercise, or with an
   accredited simulator. One of these events may substitute Item 5.11 in Table 5.1.
   5.3.4. A minimum of two of the six controls every 6 months must be non-permissive (T-0).
Non-permissive is a control where the target area threat level dictates aircraft must maintain
stand-off distances prior to target attack run. Must use a tactical scenario which requires a full
nine line CAS brief (IP to target area).
5.4. JTAC Decertification. Commanders will decertify JTAC certified personnel, in writing
(MFR or AF Form 623A), when it is determined that the individual lacks the skills, abilities
and/or is otherwise ineligible based on the requirements of Table 1.1. to continue providing
terminal attack control of aircraft (T-3). This documentation becomes a permanent part of the
individual’s JTAC training record (T-3).
   5.4.1. Decertified individuals are immediately removed from the JTAC program (T-3).
   5.4.2. Commanders must approve, in writing (MFR or AF Form 623A), a decertified
   individual’s re-entry into the JTAC program (T-3). This documentation becomes a
   permanent part of the individuals training record (T-3). Unit commanders will closely
   monitor training of previously disqualified individuals (T-3).
       5.4.2.1. Commanders will work closely with the Chief JTAC-I and Chief of Stan/Eval to
       develop a specific training and evaluation program to re-certify the individual (T-3). This
       program will list every task and type/quantity of controls that must be completed (T-3).
           5.4.2.1.1. Individuals who do not successfully complete the training and evaluation
           of paragraph 5.4.2.1. may receive one additional attempt to become re-certified, if
           recommended by the group commander (T-3).
       5.4.2.2. Individuals who fail to successfully complete re-certification twice concurrently,
       are permanently decertified from JTAC duties.
 40                                                                   AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008


             5.4.2.2.1. Commanders of 1C4X1 personnel who are permanently decertified from
             JTAC duties, will remove the individuals AFSC and recommend the individual for
             retraining or separation IAW AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.
             Commanders should consult with the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) before
             proceeding with any action to separate an individual.
    5.4.3. Certified 1C4X1 JTACs who refuse to perform JTAC duties will be permanently
    decertified. Commanders of these individuals will remove the individuals AFSC and
    recommend the individual for retraining or separation IAW AFI 36-3208 (T-3).
    Commanders should consult with the local SJA regarding possible disciplinary action for
    individuals who refuse to perform JTAC duties before proceeding with any action to retrain
    or separate an individual.

Type 2 Control - Is used when the JTAC requires control of individual attacks and any or all of
the following conditions exist:
• JTAC is unable to visually acquire the attacking aircraft at weapons release.
• JTAC is unable to visually acquire the target.
• The attacking aircraft is unable to acquire the mark/target prior to weapons release.
The JTAC must acquire the target visually or utilize targeting data from a scout, COLT, FIST,
JFO, UAS, SOF, CAS aircrew, or other asset with accurate real-time targeting information.
Type 2 control requires control of individual attacks. The JTAC/FAC(A) may be able to visually
acquire the attacking aircraft. While not required, if the tactical situation allows, the
JTAC/FAC(A) should make every effort to visually acquire the aircraft and assess attack
geometry under Type 2 control, in order to provide an additional measure of safety, enhance SA,
and be able to abort the attack if necessary. Likewise, the attacking aircraft may be able to
visually acquire the target/mark prior to weapons release, but it is not required. Examples of
when Type 2 control may be applicable are night, adverse weather, and high altitude or standoff
weapons employment. (JP 3-09.3)

academic and practical training requirements of a core JTAC training curriculum and completes
a comprehensive evaluation may be granted JTAC certification. (JTAC MOA)
Chief Joint Terminal Attack Controller—Instructor (Chief JTAC-I)—A highly qualified
individual appointed by the unit commander who is responsible for the unit’s JTAC training
program. Ensures the requirements of AFI 13-112, Volume 1, are implemented and oversees the
training and utilization of unit’s joint terminal attack controller-instructor(s).
Close Air Support (CAS)—Air action by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets
that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air
mission with the fire and movement of those forces. (JP 1-02)
Combat Control Operators (CCO)—Directs and controls the delivery and battlefield
application of lethal and non-lethal airpower. Uses visual and electronic aids to control airhead in
the area of responsibility. Establishes long-rang command and control (C2) communications and
intelligence nets. (AFMAN 36-2108)
Continuation Training (CT)—Required to maintain duty position qualification and proficiency.
Control—A control consists of at least one aircraft attacking a surface target. The control begins
with a CAS briefing (the 9-line is the JP 3-09.3 standard) from a JTAC and ends with either an
actual/simulated weapons release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls
can be counted per CAS briefing per target. (JTAC MOA)
Day Terminal Attack Control—Day terminal attack control is a control of CAS aircraft at a
point after Begin Morning Nautical Twilight (BMNT) and prior to End of Evening Nautical
Twilight (EENT).
End of Evening Nautical Twilight (EENT)—Occurs when the sun has dropped 12 degrees
below the western horizon, and is the instant of last available daylight for the visual control of
limited ground operations. At the EENT there is no further sunlight available. (JP 1-02)
Forward Air Controller (Airborne)—A specifically trained and qualified aviation officer who
exercises control from the air of aircraft engaged in close air support of ground troops. The
forward air controller (airborne) is normally an airborne extension of the tactical air control
party. (JP 3-09.3)
Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)—A qualified (certified) Service member who, from
a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in close air support and other
offensive air operations. A qualified and current joint terminal attack controller will be
recognized across the Department of Defense as capable and authorized to perform terminal
attack control.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller—Instructor (JTAC-I)—A highly qualified individual
recommended by the unit Chief JTAC-I and appointed by the unit commander who provides
training to unit JTACs. Responsible for implementing the training as required by this AFI and
developed by the unit’s Chief JTAC-I.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller Combat Mission Ready (JTAC CMR)—A status of a
JTAC who is fully qualified to perform the unit’s operational mission, maintains qualification
and proficiency in the mission, has been evaluated IAW AFI 13-112, Volume 2, and has
commander certification.
AFI13-112V1 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                   59


Joint Terminal Attack Controller Initial Qualification Training (JTAC IQT)— A formal
training process consisting of a JFCOM accredited JTAC Qualification Course designed to
initially qualify a JTAC in terminal control duties without regards to the unit’s operational
mission.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller Mission Qualification Training (JTAC MQT)—Training
required to achieve a basic level of competence in JTAC requirements and in a unit’s primary
tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for JTAC CMR status.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller Non—Combat Mission Ready (JTAC N-CMR) –
Individuals are placed in JTAC N-CMR status after failing to complete academic/proficiency
training or currency requirements within the allotted training cycle. Individuals must complete
required training IAW paragraph 4.2.2. to regain JTAC CMR status. JTACs in a JTAC N-CMR
status for more than 24 months but less than 60 months must comply with paragraph 4.2.2.1.
Laser Terminal Attack Control—Laser terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft using
a laser target designation device or terminal guidance for air-to-ground munitions. Continuation
training laser controls may be live, virtual or constructive however, live is preferred. A laser
terminal attack control is defined as control of CAS aircraft using ground-based laser designation
equipment where the JTAC has direct or indirect control over activation and deactivation. Such
equipment may be, but not limited to, the PEQ-1, GLTD II or MULE.
Live Terminal Attack Control—Live terminal attack control is control of aircraft where air-to-
ground munitions (live, inert or training ordnance) are released from the aircraft.
Live, Virtual and Constructive Training—
Live— Live training is that which is conducted in a physical environment. It normally occurs on
ranges/maneuver areas or in a Military Operating Area (MOA). (i.e. JTACs on a range
conducting a live-fly CAS mission or JTACs using a laser target designator on a range)
Virtual— Virtual training provides crews, leaders and units with realistic training experiences
using a variety of means ranging from the use of sophisticated simulators to practical exercises.
Simulators operating on virtual terrain take the place of weapon systems and can be linked to
expand the scope of the training event (i.e. JFCOM accredited simulator).
Constructive— Constructive simulation training is the use of computer models and game-type
simulations. These tools permit multiple echelons of command and staff to execute their normal
warfighting tasks in an unconstrained exercise environment (i.e. Battle Command Training Plan
Exercises).
Night Terminal Attack Control—Night terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft at a
point beyond EENT and prior to BMNT, with or without the use of night observation devices or
Infrared (IR) designators.
Practical Exercise (PE)— A CAS mission PE is a comprehensive training event that includes
all areas of mission planning, coordination, and execution, but does not involve control of actual
aircraft. The CAS mission PE is intended to make the most effective use of available training
sorties by allowing personnel to become familiar with tactics, techniques and procedures prior to
an actual mission. Each CAS mission PE could have several different outcomes/training
objectives based on the instructor’s inputs. The PE provides instant feedback to an instructor and
trainee in those areas needing improvement. Instructors use actual mission profiles and mission-

related information to familiarize the trainee with what to expect during all phases of mission
execution. Additionally, PEs can be used to complete identified CT requirements when live-fly
aircraft, equipment or ranges are not available to complete live training and the training
objectives can be met by a combination of discussion, demonstration and/or performance of the
tasks.
Proficiency—Any training event in excess of the required number for currency that enhances the
skills of the individual.
Qualified (JTAC)—A certified JTAC who has maintained currency by achieving the
established minimum recurring training and evaluation requirements. (JTAC MOA)
Special Tactics Officer—Provides assault zone reconnaissance and assessments, terminal
control, and personnel recovery (PR). Manages day-to-day operations of PR activities to
coordinate PR system and organize, train and equip assigned personnel to conduct rescue and
surveys, establishes, and controls the aerospace surface interface in objective areas. Deploys as a
team member, team leader or mission commander as a direct combatant or to command and
battle staffs to provide subject matter expertise to plan for and manage command and control for
special reconnaissance, terminal control and PR operations. (AFMAN 36-2105)
Tactical Air Command and Control Specialist (TACCS)—Performs and manages TACP
operations. Provides Air Force assistance and expertise in planning and controlling combat air
resources. Operates and supervises communications nets to support army ground maneuver units.
(AFMAN 36-2108)
Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)—A subordinate operational component of a tactical air
control system designed to provide air liaison to land forces and for control of aircraft (JP 3-
09.3). TACP is the principal Air Force liaison element aligned with Army maneuver units from
battalion through corps and consists of air liaison officers and enlisted joint terminal attack
controllers. TACPs advise ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of aerospace
power and provide the primary Air Force terminal attack control of CAS missions (AFDD 2-
1.7).
Terminal Attack Control Currency— A JTAC must perform at least two terminal attack
controls every 90 days (utilizing live-fly aircraft or an ACC-approved simulator), and six
controls (utilizing live-fly aircraft) every six months for a minimum total of twelve controls
utilizing live-fly aircraft per year using a sliding calendar. Units will conduct monthly look-
backs.
Type 1 Control—Is used when the JTAC must visually acquire the attacking aircraft and the
target for each attack. Analysis of attacking aircraft geometry is required to reduce the risk of the
attack affecting friendly forces. Language barriers when controlling coalition aircraft, lack of
confidence in a particular platform, ability to operate in adverse weather, or aircrew capability
are all examples where visual means of terminal attack control may be the method of choice (JP

Type 2 Control—Is used when the JTAC requires control of individual attacks and any or all of
the following conditions exist:
Type 3 Control—Is used when the JTAC requires the ability to provide clearance for multiple
attacks within a single engagement subject to specific attack restrictions. Like Type 1 and 2, only

a JTAC can provide Type 3 control. During Type 3 control, JTACs provide attacking aircraft
targeting restrictions (e.g., time, geographic boundaries, final attack heading, specific target set,
etc.) and then grant a “blanket” weapons release clearance (“CLEARED TO ENGAGE”). Type 3
control does not require the JTAC to visually acquire the aircraft or the target; however, all
targeting data must be coordinated through the supported commander’s battle staff. The JTAC
will monitor radio transmissions and other available digital information to maintain control of
the engagement. The JTAC maintains abort authority. Observers may be utilized to provide
targeting data and the target mark during Type 3 Control. Type 3 is a CAS terminal attack
control procedure and should not be confused with TGO or air interdiction. (JP 3-09.3, Change
