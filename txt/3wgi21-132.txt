           4.3.6.3. Conduct a crew briefing stating specifically what is to be done, how it will be done,
           and assign specific responsibilities to each recovery crew member. For any lifting operation
           (sling or airbag) utilize 3 MXG QA aircraft lifting safety briefing checklist.
           4.3.6.4. Remove personnel who are not involved in the recovery operations or safety
           surveillance.
           4.3.6.5. Ensure the wreckage is removed from the runway in minimum time commensurate
           with requirements to reopen the runway for operational use, prevent unnecessary secondary

       base agencies and the United States Army at Fort Richardson.
       4.4.3. Ensure radio traffic on all nets is held to essential transmissions during emergencies.
5. Hot Brakes Procedures:
    5.1. There are no mechanical means to determine if an aircraft has hot brakes (TO 4B-1-1, Use of
    Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations) therefore hot brakes can only be
    declared by the aircraft commander (AC) or Crash Recovery personnel. Upon notification of
    suspected hot brakes:
       5.1.1. If the aircraft is on rollout, the tower will direct the aircraft to taxi to the nearest hot brake
       area in accordance with 3WGI 13-203, Airfield and Air Traffic Control Procedures. If the
       aircraft is already at EOR, the aircraft will remain in position and personnel will evacuate the
       area.
       5.1.2. If hot brakes are suspected, the brakes will not be checked until 10 minutes have passed
       since the last application of brakes due to heat transfer from the brakes to the wheel assemblies.
       5.1.3. Fire department or Crash Recovery personnel will chock the aircraft. Personnel will
       approach an aircraft with suspected hot brakes from a forward or aft direction. Crash Recovery
       personnel will check the aircraft brakes for excessive heat after the 10 minute wait period for
       heat build up has passed and determines if brakes are hot. Fighter aircraft engines will not be
       shut down unless directed by the IC.
       5.1.4. If the AC or Crash Recovery personnel declare hot brakes, the aircraft will remain in the
       designated area for 30 minutes to allow adequate cool-down time in accordance with TO 4B-1-1,
       Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations. All personnel will stay
3WGI21-132 11 APRIL 2008                                                                                5


      clear of an area extending 300 feet in a 45 degree angle on both sides of the wheel until the
      brakes have cooled or the thermal release plugs have deflated the tires.
      5.1.5. The Senior Fire Officer on scene will direct a fire vehicle to remain with the aircraft for
      the allotted cool-down time.
      5.1.6. Aircraft may taxi back to the designated parking area after the allotted cool-down time.
   5.2. Host unit C-17, E-3, and C-12 personnel will tow their aircraft to the designated parking spot
   after the allotted cool-down period if engines are shut down. Heavy aircraft may shut down for
   evacuation purposes. The 732nd AMS will be responsible for towing all AMC aircraft back to the
   designated parking spots.
   5.3. The crash recovery team will tow all other aircraft back to its designated parking spot if engines
   are shut down after the allotted cool-down period.
6. Barrier Engagements:
   6.1. Fire department personnel will ensure the aircraft is fire safe and chocked. Fire department
   personnel will then turn control of the aircraft over to the Crash Recovery team supervisor for barrier
   extraction.
   6.2. In accordance with AFI 32-1043 alternate extraction procedures are commonly referred to as
   “slingshotting” the aircraft. Potential for aircraft damage is high when using these methods;
   therefore, use these procedures only during contingencies when conditions warrant rapid cycling of
   the arresting system.
   6.3. The crash recovery team will safe the aircraft, shut down engines, and tow the aircraft clear of
   the barrier, as required.
   6.4. For the purpose of towing the aircraft off the active runway, the crash recovery team will safe,
   as a minimum, the aircraft landing gear and all live forward firing ordnances. Immediately upon
   exiting the active runway, the tow team will stop the aircraft and all remaining safeing operations
   will be completed prior to towing the aircraft to its designated parking spot.
