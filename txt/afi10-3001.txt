                                                Chapter 1

                                           REINTEGRATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes guidance for the reintegration of Air Force prisoners of war,
detainees, and other previously isolated personnel after being returned to Air Force control until returned
to duty or released from service (hereafter referred to as returnees). It provides procedures for reception
and processing of returnees. Reintegration includes medical and psychological evaluation and
treatment, thorough intelligence and Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) debrief of the
entire event, reunification with, and support to the primary family, religious support, legal support,
Public Affairs support, casualty affairs support and security of returnees and their families. The task
provides for the health and welfare of returnees with the ultimate goal of effective and efficient return to
duty. Full reintegration consists of three distinct phases; I, II, and III. For purposes of this instruction,
Phase III will be referred to as Air Force reintegration.
    1.1.1. During military operations, personnel may become isolated, missing in action (MIA), or held
    as prisoners of war (POW). Others may be detained by nations or foreign governments not directly
    engaged in such hostilities or by antagonists, freedom fighters, mercenaries or terrorists. Returnees
    include U.S. military personnel, DOD civilian employees and DOD contractor employees. Other
    isolating incidences include being detained in peacetime by a hostile foreign government; evading
    enemy capture (whether assisted or unassisted), or being otherwise missing.
    1.1.2. Historically, the release of U.S. personnel has been arranged during formal negotiations
    between the combatants as hostilities neared an end. However, isolated personnel may be returned
    before cessation of hostilities or initiation of negotiations by one of the following methods: (a)
    release for humanitarian reasons; (b) release for propaganda purposes; (c) exchange or release of
    personnel, which may include sick and wounded; and (d) escape or forcible recovery from
    confinement. Regardless of the method of return, they may reach U.S military control at or near the
    location of negotiations, or in the zone of conflict. It is possible that isolated personnel may be
    released in or through the captor's country, a neutral or ―third‖ country, or directly to the CONUS
    through the auspices of private, non-government groups, international organizations, etc.
    1.1.3. Psychological decompression is critical to the reintegration process. The successful
    reintegration of returnees into military and social environments is affected by a returnee’s propensity
    for decompression; each individual is different. Not providing for decompression can have a severe
    impact on and, under certain circumstances, create permanent psychological trauma. Historically, if
    encountered, trauma has manifested itself in returnees separating from military service, suffering
    dysfunctional relationships, and, in severe cases, suicide.
    1.1.4. While personnel may be released or recovered incrementally, Services must provide the
    capability for the en masse release of all isolated or held captive. Planners must consider the
    possibility for large release or recovery. Contingency planning is necessary for those instances.
1.2. Waiver Authority. MAJCOM/Director of Operations (A3) or equivalent level is the waiver
authority for this instruction. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the
supplement.
1.3. Responsibilities.

  1.3.5. MAJCOMs, NAFs and Warfighting Headquarters will establish an office of primary
  responsibility (OPR) for personnel recovery IAW AFPD 10-30. Reintegration responsibility resides
  within this office. The MAJCOM OPR will provide assistance to the reintegration process as
  required.
     1.3.5.1. Note: AFPD 10-30, Personnel Recovery, designates Air Combat Command (ACC) as

       advise returnees and their families of their legal rights and benefits and to counsel and assist
       them on matters pertaining to personal legal issues and/or concerns.
       1.3.6.10. MAJCOM/HC is responsible for ensuring that sufficient chaplains and chaplain
       assistants are available to meet the spiritual needs of returnees and their families.
1.4. Assumptions. Consider when preparing for reintegration:
    1.4.1. The majority of returnees will likely be returned to U.S. military control at an overseas area.
    1.4.2. Initial COCOM reintegration (Phase I & II) will most likely be accomplished in theater.
    1.4.3. Most Air Force returnees will enter the COCOM reintegration process; not all will require Air
    Force reintegration.
    1.4.4. Returnees will require varying degrees of physical and mental treatment and reassurance of
    their personal welfare.
    1.4.5. A high degree of press and public interest may be generated by returnees.
    1.4.6. Families usually desire to be reunited at the earliest opportunity.
    1.4.7. Returnees often have vague or erroneous memories or interpretations of intensely emotional
    events. They will often need extensive opportunities to process memories with SERE and
    intelligence debriefers. Premature exposure to family or media questions can lead to inaccurate and
    potentially embarrassing personal disclosure.
    1.4.8. Successful reintegration is highly dependent upon meeting the needs of the returnee.
    1.4.9. The medical condition of the returnees could be adversely affected by combat injuries,
    extended exposure to deficient diets, exposure to contagious diseases, prolonged coercive pressures,
    and physical or emotional isolation.
    1.4.10. Air Force reintegration activities are historically infrequent and there is a high probability
    that members supporting an Air Force reintegration team may not have participated in a prior
    reintegration.
1.5. Expectations.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                            9


  1.5.1. Personnel who were isolated together should not have been separated during the initial (Phase
  I & II) reintegration process. This better facilitates psychological decompression. As much as
  possible, commanders should facilitate keeping returnees together until determination by medical
  authority that it’s no longer required.
  1.5.2. The reintegration team must regulate and control all access to the returnee during
  reintegration activities. There will be many who will want to engage the returnee for many varied
  reasons.
  1.5.3. Formal awards and decorations should not be presented until a complete investigation and
  accounting of all events have been completed.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                     REINTEGRATION PROCESS

2.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview of reintegration operations. It primarily focuses on
the Air Force’s reintegration responsibilities, however COCOM (Phase I and II) are added for complete
knowledge. Although Phase I and II are normally a combatant command responsibility, situations may
require the Air Force to conduct all three phases of reintegration.
2.2. Overview. Reintegration consists of three distinct phases: Phase I, Release and/or Recovery,
Reception, and Returnee Assessment; Phase II, Theater reintegration, usually conducted at a
predetermined transition location; and Phase III, Air Force reintegration. All three phases focus on
gathering tactical intelligence; collecting operational and SERE information; and ensuring the physical
and mental health of personnel to return to normal life and duty. When more than one person is
returned, all returnees should be moved together to the theater transition point. Experience indicates that
returnees benefit greatly from the opportunity to achieve closure with one another. This improves their
ability to overcome the isolation experience and reintegrate with their unit and family.
     2.2.1. Phase I: Release and/or Recovery, Reception, and Returnee Assessment process. All
     returnees must undergo Phase I. Phase I is normally a theater component responsibility. Phase I
     begins when returnees are in the care of the component’s theater reintegration team and must be
     initiated as soon as possible. The theater reintegration team chief is informed of Phase I location and
     is responsible to coordinate the means to accomplish Phase I. Phase I normally last approximately
     24-48 hours. Based on the theater reintegration team chief’s recommendation (with physician and
     psychologist endorsement), the component commander has the authority to return personnel to duty
     or transfer them to the next phase of reintegration.
        2.2.1.1. Phase I reintegration teams are normally comprised of: Theater reintegration team chief,
        SERE debriefer, intelligence, and SERE psychologist. Flexibility on team size and make-up is
        expected.
        2.2.1.2. Phase I normally consists of immediate medical attention and a critical intelligence
        debriefing.
            2.2.1.2.1. An immediate medical screening is conducted to ensure returnee is physically
            sound. If returnee is considered unfit to provide critical intelligence, debriefings will be
            delayed until Phase II or when the returnee is cognitively able to provide information.
            Medical personnel conduct assessment, within their capabilities, and administer treatment to
            stabilize returnees for higher care.
            2.2.1.2.2. A critical intelligence debriefing is conducted for perishable information and to
            determine the status of other isolated personnel. Critical intelligence debriefs are normally
            conducted prior to any exposure to criminal investigators which may prevent the open
            exchange of information leading to the recovery of other isolated personnel (see chapter 7 for
            legal concerns).
        2.2.1.3. In cases where isolation time was very brief, for example, when a pilot is quickly
        recovered after being shot down, an assessment by the theater reintegration team chief may
        permit an immediate return to duty after critical intelligence is garnered. In those cases, SERE
        debriefs can be accomplished at a later date.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                              11


     2.2.1.4. If Phase II is warranted, all information will be forwarded to the theater transition point
     and the Phase I team and returnee will move to the Phase II location.
     2.2.1.5. The SERE psychologist may join the team during Phase I or II. (Depending on
     availability) They begin a psychological assessment of the returnee that continues through the
     entire process.
  2.2.2. Phase II: Theater reintegration. Phase II is normally a theater responsibility and is conducted
  at a designated theater transition location. Returnees receive more thorough physical and mental
  care as well as intelligence and SERE debriefings. Decompression is a top priority for the returnee.
  The theater reintegration team chief normally manages Phase II activities. Services and MAJCOMs
  should be provided reintegration status updates. Phase II usually lasts 4-5 days.
     2.2.2.1. The Phase II reintegration team normally consists of: reintegration team chief, SERE
     psychologist, SERE debriefer, intelligence, chaplain, legal, Public Affairs representative, and
     other medical personnel as required.
     2.2.2.2. Access to returnees may become a concern during Phase II. The theater reintegration
     team chief will prevent unauthorized access to returnees and their family members during the
     reintegration process.    Commanders must strictly control access to facilities to prevent
     unauthorized individuals from interfering with the processing schedule and the privacy of
     returnees. Contact with the media and other members of the public will be limited until treating
     physicians and psychologist determine the returnee is fully prepared for such exposure.
     2.2.2.3. Decision for Air Force Reintegration. The theater reintegration team chief or medical
     authority recommends to the command authority whether or not to continue the reintegration
     process. If the decision is made to continue with Air Force reintegration, the Air Force will work
     directly with the COCOM to seamlessly execute the process.
  2.2.3. Air Force Reintegration: This final phase will normally be initiated through coordination
  with the COCOM. The AF reintegration location is normally the returnee’s assigned installation
  unless medical treatment requires a special facility. The reintegration team chief will manage the
  process and work closely with the installation commander for the successful reintegration of the
  returnee. During this phase, the returnee will receive all required medical and psychological
  treatment. Long-term medical, intelligence, and personnel issues will be addressed during this
  phase.
     2.2.3.1. Escorts. In order to facilitate a seamless transfer of the returnee from a Phase II
     location, the Air Force will provide an escort to accompany the returnee to the Air Force
     reintegration site. (Follow escort guidance in chapter 11)
     2.2.3.2. The reintegration team chief assigns duties to the reintegration team members and
     coordinates the overall process. The reintegration team chief must thoroughly review each
     member’s roles and responsibilities. Specific team member responsibilities are explained in
     subsequent chapters. Ensure all personnel involved with the returnee's care understand the
     reintegration team has full authority and protection over returnee(s) throughout the entire process
     and will not relinquish this until the reintegration team chief does so.
     2.2.3.3. Reintegration Facilities. The installation commander will provide suitable facilities to
     conduct AF reintegration. (See attachment 1 for specifics)
     2.2.3.4. Debriefings. Most debriefings have already occurred through the Phase I/II process.
     Requests for further debriefings should be closely scrutinized as this process is stressful for
12                                                                           AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


        returnees. Transcripts from prior debriefings may be useful to preclude redundant questioning of
        returnees.
            2.2.3.4.1. Only trained SERE specialists and intelligence personnel are expected to debrief
            the returnee. Subsequent debriefing focuses on the isolation experience in an effort to
            evaluate the adequacy and usefulness of SERE preparation to include operational guidance,
            training, and education. Information regarding personnel still isolated is gathered in an effort
            to fully account for those individuals.
        2.2.3.5. Family Members. The SERE psychologist, reintegration team chief and family members
        should meet to discuss the overall goals of the reintegration process and explore how the
        family’s involvement can be a positive influence in the returnee’s integration back to a normal
        life and full duty. Returnee’s wishes concerning family involvement, visitations, and inclusion
        takes precedence.
        2.2.3.6. Local and National Media. The reintegration team chief and Public Affairs
        representative will serve as the primary liaison with the media. Frequently, the reintegration
        team chief has the best awareness of what information is releasable and should work in concert
        with the Public Affairs representative. IAW DODI 3002.12, all media releases must be
        coordinated through SAF/PA with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (ASD/PA).
        High interest may develop as a result of the returnee’s experience. Reintegration team chief will
        read attachment 5 to returnees prior to media exposure.
        2.2.3.7. Criminal Investigations. If returnee(s) are under criminal investigation, the reintegration
        team chief will ensure criminal investigative personnel are provided appropriate access, in
        coordination with legal counsel. (Follow guidance in chapter 7 and 8 of this AFI)
        2.2.3.8. Reintegration timeframe. AF reintegration does not have a prescribed time limit. It’s
        based on the coordinated needs of the returnee’s mental and medical well-being as well as
        debriefing requirements. Flexibility is vital to successful reintegration. After medical release, the
        majority of interaction will most likely be between the SERE psychologist and the returnee.
        2.2.3.9. Reintegration Conclusion. AF reintegration will conclude only when required SERE
        and intelligence debriefings are concluded and the returnee is declared fit for duty, discharged, or
        retired. The reintegration team chief makes this recommendation to the MAJCOM/CC (or as
        delegated). Military Service personnel will not return to duty until all medical, psychological,
        intelligence, personnel, and casualty issues are addressed.
2.3. Reintegration Team Responsibilities and Composition.
     2.3.1. Reintegration team chief will not be encumbered with other specific responsibilities, such as
     medical treatment, debriefing, or normal duties when reintegration contingency plans are
     implemented. The team chief must be sensitive to the human problems and emotions confronting
     the returnee and his family. The reintegration team chief will also coordinate any special needs with
     the installation commander. (IAW DODI 3002.12)
     2.3.2. Returned DOD civilians/contractors, like their military counterparts are under the purview of
     the reintegration team chief.
     2.3.3. Air Force Reintegration Team Composition. The team normally consists of the following
     personnel:
        2.3.3.1. Reintegration team chief
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                            13


     2.3.3.2. SERE Psychologist
     2.3.3.3. SERE debriefer
     2.3.3.4. Intelligence debriefer
     2.3.3.5. Medical specialist
     2.3.3.6. Public Affairs specialist
     2.3.3.7. Personnel specialist
     2.3.3.8. Finance specialist
     2.3.3.9. Legal specialist
     2.3.3.10. Chaplain
     2.3.3.11. Security elements for returnees and their families
     2.3.3.12. Casualty Affairs Representative
14                                                                         AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


                                                Chapter 3

                                     COMMAND AND CONTROL

3.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes command and control relationships during reintegration.
3.2. Communications. Successful reintegration requires prompt, continuous, and responsive
communication between multiple agencies. Each phase of the reintegration involves differing levels of
command and control. Early and continuous coordination between command and control agencies is
vital to seamless execution. Phase I & II command and control information is provided for general
knowledge of the entire reintegration process.
     3.2.1. Phase I Command and Control: Theater component commanders are responsible for the rapid
     conduct of a Phase I reintegration. The Air Force is best able to support the theater by staying in a
     monitoring posture. Once Phase I reintegration activities are complete, the component commander
     passes responsibility of returnees to the combatant commander and returnees are moved to a Theater
     Phase II location.
     3.2.2. Phase II Command and Control: The Combatant Commander has responsibility for the
     returnee during Phase II. The reintegration team chief serves as the focal point for information
     relating to the returnee’s progress. If Air Force reintegration is required, combatant commands
     should notify HQ USAF Watch through appropriate channels. Once notified, HQ/USAF will aid
     coordination of returnees transfer from Phase II. HQ/USAF will notify ACC and the receiving
     MAJCOM (if returnee is assigned to an OCONUS installation and is sent CONUS for medical
     treatment, HQ USAF will designate a responsible CONUS MAJCOM). The Combatant Commander
     passes responsibility for the returnee once the individual is in Air Force control.
     3.2.3. Air Force Reintegration Command and Control: Returnee’s designated MAJCOM assumes
     responsibility for the returnee upon arrival to CONUS. The reintegration team chief, once on
     station, provides progress reports to the returnee’s chain of command and higher headquarters, as
     required. The reintegration team chief will work directly with the installation commander for
     requests regarding force support, facilities, and services relating to the needs of the returnee. The
     MAJCOM commander has the authority to return the individual back to duty, continue reintegration
     activities, or to begin administrative separation actions removing the individual from service if
     required.
     3.2.4. Established Command and Control channels will be utilized for processing returnees. Due to
     the political gravity and national policy aspects that reintegration may generate, HQ USAF may
     require full and prompt updates. MAJCOMs will be kept informed in those instances of direct
     communication between HQ USAF and subordinate commands.
3.3. Communications Procedures. The HQ USAF Watch will be utilized as the initial
communications focal point for activities associated with returnees. Upon notification, the Watch will
inform AF/A3O of an imminent reintegration. (See AF Watch contacts in Attachment 1)
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                              15


                                              Chapter 4

                           SPECIAL SUPPORT TO REINTEGRATION

4.1. Purpose. To provide guidance for SERE debriefer, SERE psychologist and reintegration team
chief support to the reintegration process.
4.2. General Guidance. Proper reintegration of individuals requires trained SERE Specialists, SERE
psychologists and reintegration team chiefs. SERE Specialists (1T0X1 AFSC) are trained to gather
information from returnees and distribute critical information and lessons learned back to the war
fighter. SERE psychologists are trained to assist returnees during decompression and reintegration back
to normal life. SERE psychologists are frequently the most important part of the process to ensure
mental health and stability of a returnee after traumatic incidences. Reintegration team chiefs are
responsible for managing the overall process and ensuring the best results for the returnee and the
Service. Combat Rescue Officers (13DXA AFSC) are trained as reintegration team chiefs and may
perform duty as the team chief (if O-6) or aid the O-6 team chief as deputy team chief if requested.
   4.2.1. SERE debriefings focus on the isolation environment and SERE related issues. Information
   improves SERE tactics, techniques and procedures but also provides lessons-learned for future
   SERE instruction. Collection must be conducted in a timely manner to avoid ensuing memory
   degradation. The individual must be as free from emotional overload and distortion as possible in
   order for information to be reliable. The optimum facilitative balance between decompression and
   debriefing yields the best results.
   4.2.2. SERE psychologists work closely with the reintegration team chief and the whole
   reintegration team providing guidance as to the mental health of the returnee. In many instances, the
   SERE psychologist may direct the whole team’s actions to ensure the returnee’s mental health and
   decompression is progressing.
4.3. SERE Debrief. SERE debriefers should agree upon a sequence of events for interview sessions.
Because SERE debriefing affords a measure of confidentiality that intelligence debriefing does not, the
team must ensure that the returnee clearly understands the distinction between intelligence and SERE
debrief sessions. If possible, intelligence and SERE debriefers will each attend the other’s debrief
sessions to monitor the information exchange and develop follow-up questions to be covered in
subsequent sessions. Additionally, SERE psychologists can attend any debriefing. The intelligence and
SERE debriefs take place in a sequence decided by debriefers and the reintegration team chief. The
sequence is influenced by the availability of debriefers and other factors.
4.4. Full disclosure. Full disclosure of information is the goal for lessons learned. The SERE debrief
focuses on the isolation experience in an effort to evaluate the adequacy and usefulness of:
   4.4.1. SERE preparation to include operational guidance, training, and education.
   4.4.2. SERE products that were provided to include evasion aids, radios, and survival equipment.
   4.4.3. The Personnel Recovery processes that either assisted or hindered their isolation, including
   efforts made to locate, support, and recover them.
   4.4.4. The SERE debriefs must be allowed to follow accepted protocols as established by AFTTP 3-
   3.08, Guardian Angel, to produce verbal and visual recordings that are essential to SERE analysis
   and development of lessons learned.
16                                                                             AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


     4.4.5. The ideal ratio of debriefers to returnees is one: one. It is difficult for a debriefer to track and
     encourage the story of more than one returnee, especially if the returnees experienced the same event
     together.
4.5. SERE Debriefer Qualification. SERE debriefers must attend a qualification course prior to
conducting debriefer duties. Currently, PR 240, Personnel Recovery Debriefer’s Course, qualifies
SERE Specialists as debriefers.
4.6. SERE Psychologist Qualification. SERE psychologists must have attended a qualification course
and been certified by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA). AF/A3O will assist in coordinating
for a SERE psychologist, if required, to aid the reintegration process.
4.7. Reintegration Team Chief Qualification. Reintegration team chiefs may attend a qualification
course prior to conducting team chief duties. Currently, PR 241, Reintegration Team Chief Course,
trains members to perform their duties.
     4.7.1. DODI 3002.12 mandates the Service reintegration team chief be an O-6. This is primarily
     due to the maturity and political sensitivity required for the reintegration process. Few colonels,
     however, have attended PR 241 or possess prior reintegration experience. In these situations,
     designated O-6 reintegration team chiefs should request a Combat Rescue Officer as deputy team
     chief to aid them during the process. CRO augmentation can be requested through their MAJCOM.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                               17


                                               Chapter 5

                         MEDICAL GUIDANCE FOR REINTEGRATION

5.1. Purpose. Establishes policy, assigns responsibility and prescribes procedures for medical
processing of returnees.
5.2. Background. Rigorous circumstances that confront isolated personnel may require that each
returnee receive considerate and individualized attention after return. Experience indicates that the
physical and mental condition of returnees may have deteriorated during the period of isolation.
Accordingly, full medical evaluation and oversight should occur as soon as possible. They should
remain in medical channels for transportation to CONUS and for as long thereafter as is necessary to
fully identify and treat all medical problems to the maximum extent possible.
5.3. Objective. To provide returnees a complete medical evaluation for future reference, to initiate
corrective medical treatment as soon as indicated, to maintain or restore dignity, to facilitate return to
duty or civilian status, and readjust to society.
5.4. Assumptions.
   5.4.1. Preliminary information regarding the number of returned personnel being released or their
   medical conditions may be limited.
   5.4.2. All personnel identified for AF reintegration will require some medical care.
   5.4.3. The medical condition of the returnees could be adversely affected by combat injuries,
   extended exposure to deficient diets, exposure to contagious diseases, prolonged coercive pressures,
   and physical and emotional isolation.
5.5. Responsibilities:
   5.5.1. Commanders of designated Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) will implement prescribed
   procedures concerning medical processing of returnees.
   5.5.2. Commanders of designated MTFs will ensure all medical records are reviewed for accuracy
   and completeness prior to releasing the patient and the medical records.
   5.5.3. Commanders of designated MTFs will ensure medical personnel handle medical records.
5.6. Concept of Operations. Personnel requiring AF reintegration will be returned to CONUS as soon
as possible consistent with their medical needs. Medical records should have accompanied returnee.
Prior medical evaluation should have diagnosed health problems, instituted treatment as necessary, and
made a medical determination of the individual's suitability for aeromedical evacuation.
   5.6.1. Return to CONUS.
       5.6.1.1. Returnees should be identified to HQ USAF through Air Force Watch.
       5.6.1.2. Prior medical record screening and behavioral assessment should identify special
       medical needs/conditions.
       5.6.1.3. Efforts should be made to place the returnee in hospitals close to family. Requirements
       for specific medical treatment may dictate placing the individual in a hospital with specialized
       facilities. When more than one person is returned, all returnees should remain together until the
       debriefing process is complete regardless of Service affiliation.
   5.6.2. Continued medical evaluation and treatment.
18                                                                            AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


        5.6.2.1. Completion of medical assessment not accomplished in theater.
        5.6.2.2. Continuation of prior medical treatment plan.
        5.6.2.3. Identification of additional medical needs.
        5.6.2.4. Sub-specialty medical management, as needed.
        5.6.2.5. Referral to medical evaluation program at the Naval Operational Medicine Institute,
        Robert E. Mitchell Center of Prisoner of War Studies, Pensacola, Florida, as appropriate.
5.7. General Guidance.
     5.7.1. SERE psychologists (or mental health professionals if a SERE psychologist is not available)
     will be available to support the returnee’s psychological needs.
     5.7.2. Air Force returnees will be reported through medical channels to the Global Patient
     Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC) for assignment to CONUS hospitals.
     5.7.3. If required, intelligence and SERE debriefings may be conducted during hospitalization of
     returnees only if the returnee is not under any medications that could preclude an accurate debriefing
     and the returnee is capable of participating. Optimum debriefing conditions will be provided
     consistent with the patient's medical requirements.
     5.7.4. Whenever possible during medical processing, physicians should explain to the returnee the
     various purposes of the physical examination and treatment.
     5.7.5. If required, access rosters will be used to limit exposure to the returnee. The reintegration
     team chief will coordinate security if required.
     5.7.6. Returnees should be allowed to spend free time, including evenings and nights, with family
     once it’s been determined they are ready for such activity. Medical authority will make
     recommendations as to whether the returnee is free of any communicable disease. In general,
     medical and psychological evaluations, debriefings, and personnel processing should not interfere
     with the reunion between returnees and their families.
5.8. CONUS Medical Processing. Comprehensive documentation of the returnee’s medical condition
and returning them to normal duty or civilian status as quickly as possible is paramount. Thorough and
detailed medical documentation of diagnoses, treatment, and progress must be maintained for future
treatment.
     5.8.1. Medical examinations in CONUS hospitals will include a thorough review of the returnee's
     health record, a detailed medical history of the isolation period, and medical evaluation of all
     conditions associated with isolation.
     5.8.2. Medical examinations will be conducted IAW AFI 48-123 Medical Examinations and
     Standards and AFPAM 48-133 Physical Examination Techniques to determine the returnee's
     medical qualification for active military duty and to establish a baseline that reflects the individual's
     medical status at the time of release/reintegration. This examination will normally be accomplished
     in the CONUS hospital to which the returnee is initially assigned. However, if the returnee is
     hospitalized overseas for purposes other than to determine suitability for aeromedical evacuation, the
     overseas hospital will perform this examination.
     5.8.3. Protection of public health will be given high consideration in all circumstances.
5.9. Medical Reporting. The following guidance supplements existing medical policies and
regulations, and pertains specifically to the medical processing of returnees:
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                              19


   5.9.1. The findings of the initial overseas examination will be documented on AF IMT 3899a,
   Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record (Continuation Sheet) (or other Air Force approved
   aeromedical evacuation patient record form). This form represents a medical clearance for patient
   movement and accompanies the individual to the CONUS hospital. In transit medical information
   will be added as appropriate.
   5.9.2. A Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 2808) and Report of Medical History (DD Form
   2807.1) (or other approved hardcopy or electronic form) will be accomplished for each returnee.
   Entries on the DD Forms 2808 and 2807-1 will be in accordance with AFPAM 48-133 Physical
   Examination Techniques.
   5.9.3. The Narrative Summary of Hospitalization, SF 502 (or other Air Force approved narrative
   summary of hospitalization form), will include results of procedures accomplished as indicated in
   paragraph 5.10.
   5.9.4. One copy of the "baseline" report, DD Forms 2808 and 2807-1 (or approved electronic
   version), and a copy of SF 502, will be forwarded to Headquarters Air Force (AFMSA/SGPA), 110
   Luke Avenue, Room 405, Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C. 20032-7050, when the returnee is
   discharged from the CONUS hospital. Commanders of CONUS hospitals will ensure accuracy and
   completeness prior to forwarding. A copy of the above forms will be forwarded to the Robert E.
   Mitchell Center for POW Studies, 220 Hovey Road, Pensacola, FL 32508, (850) 452-2157, as
   required.
   5.9.5. Classified medical information regarding the isolation environment will be included in
   intelligence documents only.
5.10. Special Medical Considerations for Processing Returnees. Consider and document unique
conditions due to isolation:
   5.10.1. Abnormal diseases present in each patient.
   5.10.2. Traumatic abnormalities, including dental conditions.
   5.10.3. Dietary deficiency diseases.
   5.10.4. Infectious diseases, such as malaria and other communicable diseases (e.g., tuberculosis,
   HIV).
   5.10.5. Torture, sexual assault, environmental exposures, and therapy instituted during that period.
   5.10.6.   Use of acupuncture, cupping, medications, immunizations, hallucinatory-inducing
   substances, and hypnotic-inducing methods utilized during isolation.
   5.10.7. Parasitic diseases, visual pathology and dysfunction, and mental stresses incurred.
5.11. Psychiatric Assessment. A psychiatric assessment and capability for psychosocial readjustment
should be ascertained. The assessment will be accomplished via a structured clinical interview,
preferably by a SERE psychologist, per current Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) criteria with
special attention to the evaluation of Acute Stress Disorder or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
5.12. Considerations for Civilian Returnees. Civilians qualify for all treatment described in this AFI
in accordance with Air Force Handbook 41-114, Military Health Services System (MHSS) Matrix,
Table 3. A civilian employee who is wounded or injured in the performance of duty, regardless of
location, is entitled to workers' compensation benefits. Processing of a compensation claim with the
Office of Workers' Compensation (OWCP) would have to be initiated and a determination made for
approval by OWCP in order for workers' compensation benefits (both medical and pay) to begin.
20                                                                     AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


Additionally, an employee can use the "leave buy-back" option if or when an OWCP claim is approved.
The option allows the employee to use personal annual or sick leave and then later have the personal
leave restored by being "bought back" by OWCP and replaced by injury compensation leave without
pay. Either way, the employee will be paid during convalescence, if the injury compensation claim is
approved by OWCP. Contractor leave should be addressed in their contract.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                                    21


                                                Chapter 6

                                              DEBRIEFING

6.1. Purpose. Provides supplemental guidance and procedures for debriefing returnees.
6.2. Background. It is imperative that returnees be comprehensively debriefed on their experiences as
soon as possible after they return to U.S. military control. The importance of expeditious debriefing is
underscored by the following:
   6.2.1. Returnees may be able to provide information identifying or clarifying the status of other
   isolated personnel.
   6.2.2. To mitigate the enemy’s ability to exploit isolated personnel.
   6.2.3. Rapid improvement and development of tactics, training programs, equipment, and policy.
   6.2.4. To aid mental rehabilitation and adjustment of the returnees.
6.3. Debriefing Objective. To acquire information concerning:
   6.3.1. Identification, condition, and location of known captives not yet returned to US control;
   individuals listed as missing in action and/or those known or suspected to have died in isolation.
   6.3.2. Information of tactical and strategic value.
   6.3.3. Information regarding last mission and evasion/escape efforts.
   6.3.4. Information concerning capture, routes to internment facility, facility description, and staff.
   6.3.5. Details on facility location and prisoner routine to include security, handling, processing,
   privileges, general treatment, and other aspects of isolation.
   6.3.6. Details on the coercive pressures used by the captors for the purpose of inducing compliance,
   objectives of interrogation, procedures and techniques used in efforts to extract military information,
   and the techniques used in any indoctrination efforts.
   6.3.7. Knowledge of US military operations, plans, systems, etc., displayed by captor interrogators.
   6.3.8. Information indicative of attempts to subvert or recruit U.S. personnel.
   6.3.9. Details concerning enemy intelligence apparatus, composition, methods, etc.
   6.3.10. All other information of interest to, or required by, the U.S. intelligence and SERE
   community.
6.4. Debriefing Assumptions.         Medical condition permitting, most returnees will have already
accomplished the following:
   6.4.1. The critical intelligence debrief (usually at Phase I). Critical intelligence is rapidly fed back to
   the war fighter for operational planning.
   6.4.2. Phase II debriefings which expand on intelligence and SERE information. Subsequent
   debriefings will be accomplished commensurate with medical treatment and the personal welfare of
   the returnees.
   6.4.3. It’s possible that the returnee’s medical condition prevented any debriefing prior to return to
   CONUS. Examples include intubation, coma, head trauma, etc. In this situation, the reintegration
22                                                                             AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


     team chief may have to ensure all intelligence and SERE debriefings are accomplished once the
     returnee is able to provide them.
6.5. Debriefing Guidance.
     6.5.1. Debriefing of returnees is essential and will be conducted concurrently with medical
     treatment. However, medical treatment and personal welfare of returnees are the highest priority.
     6.5.2. Isolation is not a state of culpability, and returnees will be treated accordingly.
     6.5.3. Returnees enjoy various legal rights and privileges, which must be recognized and protected
     at every stage of the process. NOTE: If, during the debriefing process, a returnee makes any
     statement implicating themselves or others in violating the UCMJ or other law, follow guidance in
     chapter 7 and 8 of this instruction.
     6.5.4. Returnee debriefings shall be obtained under an expressed written promise of confidentiality.
     Debriefings are treated as privileged information under the provisions of 10 USC 1506(d) (1), and
     are property of the Department of Defense, and will not be released to the public. Use the DD Form
     2810, Personnel Recovery Debriefing Statement, found in Attachment 6 of this instruction to inform
     the returnee that debriefings will remain confidential to the extent authorized by law.
     6.5.5. Disclosure of sensitive information can be harmful to the returnee, ongoing U.S. operations
     and future operations. Reintegration team chief will read attachment 5 to all returnees before any
     release of information.
     6.5.6. Debriefing teams will be composed of trained personnel to ensure maximum acquisition of
     pertinent information.
     6.5.7. To avoid redundant questioning of returnees, the reintegration team chief will request prior
     theater reintegration transcripts, and provide these to subsequent debriefers.
     6.5.8. Debriefers should be of commensurate rank and grade of returnee if possible.
     6.5.9. Debriefing teams will use recording devices. Debriefings will be recorded in their entirety
     and subsequently transcribed to provide a complete history of each returnee's experiences.
     Debriefers will advise returnees that recording devices are to be used and will explain the purpose of
     their employment.
     6.5.10. Debriefers may contact individuals who know the returnee. Valuable insights into normal
     disposition may be useful during debriefing.
6.6. Phase I Debriefing. Provided for background knowledge but may be performed by Air Force
reintegration team.
     6.6.1. Phase I critical intelligence debriefing will be limited to information of immediate tactical
     value to include:
        6.6.1.1. Information concerning the status and location of captured, detained, or missing
        personnel who remain isolated.
        6.6.1.2. How person became isolated (mechanism) and how to counter the mechanism.
        6.6.1.3. Captor weaponry and tactics used during event.
        6.6.1.4. Warnings or threats made by the captor concerning actions or statements which, if
        committed by returnee, would endanger the welfare of personnel still held captive.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                                  23


   6.6.2. The length of time that the returnee is subjected to daily debriefing will be based on medical
   and operational factors. However, in most cases, critical intelligence debriefs should not exceed 4
   hours per day.
   6.6.3. Phase I debriefing reports will include a brief evaluation by the debriefer of limiting factors,
   i.e., returnee attitude, medical condition, etc., that may affect the returnee's availability for in depth
   debriefings in Phase II and/or III.
6.7. Phase II Debriefing. Provided for background knowledge but may be performed by Air Force
reintegration team.
   6.7.1. Phase II debriefing is designed to acquire a complete account of the returnee's experiences
   from the last mission through return to US control.
   6.7.2. SERE debriefers will follow standard protocols and debriefing guides to ensure complete
   disclosure.
   6.7.3. The length of debriefing sessions should be geared to the returnee's wishes and medical
   condition but normally not longer than 2-3 hours per session.
6.8. AF Reintegration Debriefing.
   6.8.1. Information collected during debriefing will be closely held and released through the
   reintegration team chief to appropriate agencies as required.
   6.8.2. In situations where multiple agencies have the need to debrief a returnee, the reintegration
   team chief may designate a Chief Debriefer (CD) who will coordinate all debriefing activities. This
   will mitigate the possibility of unintentional repeat questioning of the returnee. However, it is
   understood that repeat questioning is a recognized debriefing technique.
   6.8.3. Debriefers should be familiar with the following: the isolation environment, rehabilitation and
   readjustment problems that returnee might face, Air Force policies, procedures, and debriefing
   guidance.
   6.8.4. Before meeting the returnee, each debriefer should have the opportunity to study appropriate
   data relative to the returnee and his period of isolation. Every effort will be made to enhance rapport
   and association between the returnee and his debriefer. Finally, debriefers should understand the
   returnee’s responsibilities to the recovery process.
6.9. Debriefers will:
   6.9.1. Coordinate with reintegration team chief and medical personnel to ensure mission
   accomplishment consistent with medical priorities and returnee welfare.
   6.9.2. Ensure security of debriefing documentation.
6.10. Classification of Debriefing Information. Debriefing data will be classified according to
content, but normally not below SECRET (IAW JPRA Personnel Recovery Security Classification
Guide).
   6.10.1. Sensitive data includes: aspects of last mission if previously classified, resistance techniques,
   escape and evasion activities, recovery/ reintegration actions, information about personnel still
   isolated, and any information on alleged acts of misconduct.
   6.10.2. Some information, including resistance techniques, escape and evasion activities,
   recovery/reintegration mechanisms, may require SECRET NOFORN classification.
24                                                                           AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


     6.10.3. Consideration should be given to releaseability to coalition partners.
     6.10.4. If necessary, AF/A2 will reclassify+ any debriefing reports during the reintegration process
     before disseminated.
6.11. Reporting Procedures.
     6.11.1. Phase I & Phase II debriefing reports are the component and theater’s responsibility.
     (Except in those instances described above when all debriefings are gained in CONUS) The theater
     Joint Personnel Recovery Center and JPRA are required to forward Phase I and II debriefings reports
     to the Services. Reintegration team chief can request prior reports as required.
     6.11.2. Data regarding personnel still isolated is restricted to operational planners and HQ USAF.
     6.11.3. Debriefers will provide periodic reports on debriefing activities. The reintegration team
     chief will forward through appropriate channels to AF/A3O.
6.12. Follow-up Debriefing. Returnee(s) will not normally be held at processing centers solely for
debriefing. If follow-up debriefing is necessary, they will be arranged in coordination with MAJCOMs.
Returnee's welfare and recovery will be given priority at all times. Care will be taken not to interfere
with the returnee's leave, training or job assignment.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                             25


                                              Chapter 7

                                               LEGAL

7.1. Purpose. To provide returnees all rights and privileges which they enjoy under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ), the U.S. Constitution, other applicable laws, regulations and directives. To
ensure that appropriate legal counsel be available to all returnees concerning any personal legal
problems or other administrative matters.
7.2. General Guidance.
   7.2.1. Legal guidance may be necessary due to the length of isolation.
   7.2.2. In rare instances, returnees may have violated the UCMJ or other law during isolation.
   Indications of violations may surface before or during debriefings. This could take three forms:
       7.2.2.1. Returnees may make a statement which indicates that another returnee may have
       violated the UCMJ or other law during isolation.
       7.2.2.2. Returnees may make a statement indicating that they themselves may have violated the
       UCMJ or other law while in isolation.
       7.2.2.3. Prior reliable information from other sources may have been received that indicates that
       such returnee may have violated the UCMJ or other law during isolation.
       7.2.2.4. Upon receipt of such statement or information, stop debrief and follow guidance in
       paragraph 7.5.
7.3. Legal Policy.
   7.3.1. The reintegration team chief and other debriefers should consult with the local Staff Judge
   Advocate for advice on matters arising within their functional areas which have legal implications.
   7.3.2. The fact that a person has been held as a prisoner of war or detainee provides no basis for
   suspecting him/her of a violation of the UCMJ or other law.
   7.3.3. Any evidence of an offense by a returnee will be referred immediately to the appropriate Air
   Force authorities as specified in this chapter and the necessary guidance obtained before proceeding.
   7.3.4. All applicable legal rights and privileges will be afforded any person who is suspected or
   accused of any violation while isolated. In light of physiological, spiritual, and psychological
   pressures to which a returnee may have been subject, particular care must be taken to ensure that
   these rights and privileges are in no way compromised or diluted.
   7.3.5. Normal Air Force investigative, administrative, and disciplinary proceedings will be
   followed.
   7.3.6. Information concerning returnees and their families must be released and authorized by the
   reintegration team chief and through Air Force PA personnel.
7.4. Legal Responsibilities.
   7.4.1. Air Force Component Commander. To ensure uniformity, disciplinary actions addressing
   misconduct of Air Force members alleged to have occurred while the member was isolated will
   usually be exercised by the Commander of the Air Component to the Combatant Command which
   held responsibility for military action in the AOR. Action should, however, be coordinated with the
   Component Commander to which the member is permanently assigned, if possible. This restriction
26                                                                            AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


     does not, however, limit the ability of Air Force authorities to assign personnel subject to such
     disciplinary action to MAJCOMs outside of the Air Component's command.
     7.4.2. Staff Judge Advocate.
        7.4.2.1. Act as legal advisor to the reintegration team chief and debriefers.
        7.4.2.2. Process all claims for lost personal possessions in accordance with AFI 51-502
        Personnel and Government Recovery Claims.
        7.4.2.3. Ensure that appropriate legal assistance is available to all returnees.
7.5. Guidelines When a Violation of Law is Suspected.
     7.5.1. General Guidance.
        7.5.1.1. No returnee suspected or accused of any offense committed in isolation will be
        interrogated or requested to make any statement during an official military investigation or while
        acting as an instrument of the military, without first being advised of his rights under Article 31,
        UCMJ (for individuals subject to the UCMJ), or Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (for
        those not subject to the UCMJ) in accordance with the procedures provided in this chapter.
        7.5.1.2. Debriefers must stop debriefing and consult legal authorities the moment they first
        suspect a returnee of an offense. If subsequent inquiry arises as to whether the debriefer
        suspected a person of a violation of law at a particular point in time, and failed to inform the
        returnee of their legal rights and inform authorities, the debriefer's judgment will be evaluated in
        light of all relevant facts and circumstances.
     7.5.2. Accusatory Statement against Another.
        7.5.2.1. When an accusatory statement involving an alleged violation of law is made against a
        returnee, the accuser will be permitted to complete their statement. However, the debriefer to
        whom the accusation is made must be alert that the person making the accusation may be an
        accomplice of, fellow conspirator with, or liable as a principal with the person against whom the
        accusation is made. Upon suspicion of any such involvement in a possible violation of law
        during isolation, the debriefer should consider the person making the accusation as a suspect and
        immediately comply with paragraph 7.5.1.2.
        7.5.2.2. If the person making an accusation against another is not suspected of any violation,
        either directly or indirectly, he/she need not be advised of any of the legal rights specified in this
        chapter. (For the purpose of this chapter, a statement, which indicates that another returnee may
        have violated the law, is an accusatory statement, even if the person making the statement does
        not intend to accuse the other returnee of a violation.)
     7.5.3. If, prior to debriefing, reliable sources indicate possible misconduct by a returnee while
     isolated, such information must be fully evaluated. Local SJA or legal office may assist debriefing
     team in this situation.
7.6. Specific Guidance to Staff Judge Advocates.
     7.6.1. All staff judge advocates are encouraged to communicate directly with the following offices
     concerning reintegration matters:
        7.6.1.1. Any legal questions, other than those specified in (2) below, relating to developing local
        plans, implementations, Code of Conduct or policy matters should be directed to the Operations
        International Law Division (AF/JAO), Headquarters, United States Air Force.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                              27


      7.6.1.2. Specific questions concerning military justice should be directed to the Air Force Legal
      Operations Agency (AFLOA/JAJM).
      7.6.1.3. Legal annexes to supporting instructions will be forwarded directly to AF/JAO,
      Headquarters, United States Air Force, in addition to any other distribution required.
   7.6.2. Legal Assistance.
      7.6.2.1. Due to lengthy periods of isolation, returnees may have many complicated legal
      problems to discuss with legal assistance officers. Staff judge advocates will develop local
      procedures to ensure availability of counsel and that necessary priority is given to this function.
      7.6.2.2. Legal assistance officers assigned to this duty should be fully familiar with the other
      aspects of this instruction. They should also be familiar with general areas in which returnees
      may have legal problems such as the use of power of attorney by family, domestic relations,
      consumer law, and legal problems that cross over into financial issues, including federal and
      state taxes. They should also be familiar with federal legislation relating to prisoners of war.
      (See 37 USC 551-558; 50 USC, App 2005(f)) All legal assistance officers should have in-depth
      knowledge of the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. §§501-593), the Uniformed
      Services Former Spouses Protection Act (10 U.S.C. §1408), and the Uniformed Services
      Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (38 U.S.C. §§4301-4333).
   7.6.3. Appointment of Counsel. Suspects or those accused of violating the law who indicate a
   desire for counsel should be referred to the local Area Defense Counsel (ADC) if military members.
   (If civilian employees or contractors; refer them to civilian counsel IAW AFI 51-504, Legal
   Assistance, Notary and Preventative Law Procedures.) If there is no local ADC available, contact
   AFLOA/JAJD at Bolling Air Force Base, DSN 297-1582, for assignment of defense counsel or to
   provide additional defense counsel as required.
   7.6.4. Standards of Conduct.
      7.6.4.1. It is not anticipated or expected that misconduct arising to the level of violation of the
      law during isolation will be an issue. It is stressed that a person held in captive status provides
      absolutely no grounds for suspecting them of any law violation. However, it is possible that a
      few isolated cases of violations may be alleged. All factors present in an individual case will be
      fully evaluated before any determination is made.
      7.6.4.2. Staff judge advocates should ensure that their legal staffs are fully familiar with
      paragraph 7.6. The following legal articles and cases may also be helpful: 56 Columbia Law

AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                                29

                                                Chapter 8

                  AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION (AFOSI)

8.1. Purpose. Defines AFOSI responsibility during reintegration.
     8.1.1. Per AFI 71-101, Volume 1, Criminal Investigations, AFOSI will initiate investigations when
     Air Force members are victims of criminal or terrorist actions. Criminal investigative interviews of
     illegally held returnees are necessary to further the investigative process with the aim of recovering
     additional victims, bringing the culpable to justice whether through judicial or direct action means
     and enhancing the DOD’s defensive posture against criminal and/or terrorist acts by developing
     intelligence of criminal/terrorist networks. AF Mission Directive 39, Air Force Office of Special
     Investigations (AFOSI), also provides the framework for AFOSI’s responsibilities and roles in
     conducting criminal and counterintelligence investigations.
     8.1.2. AFOSI will investigate allegations of serious (as defined below) violations of the Uniform
     Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and United States Code (U.S.C.).
8.2. Investigation Mission Assumptions . When members of the Air Force are taken into captivity by
a non-state actor, particularly in cases of criminal or terrorist kidnappings, AFOSI will open a criminal
investigation with the express purpose of returning the victim, prosecuting the culpable, and enhancing
defensive measures. Likewise, while in captivity, there may be instances of service members violating
the law.
     8.2.1. A returnee may possess information of critical importance to prosecuting judicial or direct
     action against the captors.
     8.2.2. A returnee may possess information of great intelligence value critical to the defensive
     posturing of DOD personnel, assets and operations.
     8.2.3. A returnee may possess information regarding violations of the Geneva Conventions and
     international law committed by captors.
     8.2.4. A returnee may make a statement which indicates that another returnee may have violated the
     law during captivity.
     8.2.5. A returnee may make a statement indicating that he or she may have violated the law while in
     captivity.
     8.2.6. Prior reliable information from other sources may have been received that provides a
     reasonably firm indication that such returnee may have violated the law during captivity.
8.3. Investigation Policy. Upon receiving information pertaining to the possible violation of the UCMJ
or other law, the reintegration team chief will consult with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) to determine
the legal implications. Once the determination has been made that the matter warrants further
investigation, matter will be forwarded to AFOSI.
     8.3.1. AFOSI will analyze all alleged criminal violations that result from information disclosed
     during the reintegration process, which the SJA deems as requiring further investigation. The
     AFOSI Detachment Commander supporting the particular reintegration effort has the authority to
     accept or decline investigative responsibility, upon coordination with higher AFOSI HQ approval,
     based on:
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                               31


       8.3.1.1. The specificity of the allegations. Some allegations may be too vague or lack detail to
       warrant initiating a substantive investigation.
       8.3.1.2. Seriousness of the offense. Because not all law violations warrant an AFOSI
       investigation, the AFOSI will only investigate major criminal offense allegations. AFOSI
       Manual 71-122, AFOSI Manual 71-119, and AFI 71-101, V1 Criminal Investigations, outlines
       specifically the types of investigations that require AFOSI’s specialized investigative techniques.
8.4. Counterintelligence. In accordance with AF Policy Directive 71-1, Criminal Investigations and
Counterintelligence; HAF Mission Directive 39, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI);
and AFI 71-101, Volume 4, Counterintelligence, AFOSI is the sole entity in the Air Force authorized to
conduct counterintelligence activities and operations. Thus, AFOSI will play a key role in ascertaining
any counterintelligence concerns. AFOSI will provide counterintelligence services as necessary to
reintegration team members and returnees. Services may include, but are not limited to: defensive
counterintelligence awareness briefings and coordination with national level counterintelligence
agencies.
32                                                                          AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


                                                Chapter 9

                                           PUBLIC AFFAIRS

9.1. Purpose. To provide Public Affairs guidance and policy during reintegration.
9.2. General Guidance. Secretary of the Air Force Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) is responsible
for all media activities regarding reintegration. Returnee statements could impact national foreign
policy and ongoing operations to locate other isolated personnel. Public Affairs personnel must be
concerned with security requirements, the health and welfare of returnees and their families, and the
interests of others still isolated. Efforts may be required to either shield or ensure contact between the
news media and the returnees and/or their families, according to their wishes.
     9.2.1. Medical evaluation and rehabilitation of the returnee is the primary consideration and may
     require PA assistance and counsel to help manage the returnee’s and/or the family’s stress when
     dealing with media requests.
     9.2.2. Granting media interviews will be in accordance with SAF/PA directives and guidance as
     well as the wishes and welfare of returnees and their families.
9.3. Public Affairs Objectives.
     9.3.1. Provide the news media with timely and factual information concerning returnees.
     9.3.2. Provide guidance and assistance to returnees and their family members in dealing with news
     media representatives’ requests.
     9.3.3. Conduct media training for returnee and family members, as required.           This includes
     preparing family responses to safeguard sensitive information.
     9.3.4. Establish central points of contact for news media at Air Force installations designated to
     receive and process returnees.
9.4. Policy. Security considerations and the necessity for uniformity among the military services
require that the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (ASD (PA)) exercise
overall responsibility for Public Affairs activities relative to returned Prisoners of War and other
detainees. Contact between returnees and the media for interviews, press conferences, public statements
and answers to press queries, will be coordinated and approved by ASD (PA) through SAF/PA.
9.5. Media Assumptions. U.S. policy dictates that news media be allowed free access to unclassified
and non-sensitive information relative to returnees and their experiences while isolated.
     9.5.1. News media interest in the returnees and their families may be intense.
     9.5.2. Access to the news media can be delayed indefinitely for medical or security reasons or when
     individuals elect not to meet with the press.
     9.5.3. Family members are likely to be contacted by the media asking them to put a public face on
     the plight of their loved ones. Some families may initiate this contact themselves, although they are
     advised by their casualty representatives and PA points of contact not to do so.
9.6. Basic Guidance. Prior to the Air Force assuming control of returnees, the combatant command is
responsible for issuing Public Affairs guidance to the returnees and for exercising authority, in full
coordination with SAF/PA, for clearance and release of public information regarding the reintegration.
     9.6.1. AFPC/PA will provide background information about personnel policies regarding returnees.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                               33


   9.6.2. The Public Affairs representative at each processing location will provide assistance to the
   reintegration team, returnees and family members during the reintegration process.
   9.6.3. Unless otherwise instructed, Public Affairs at processing bases will contact SAF/PA for
   guidance and policy through MAJCOM channels.
   9.6.4. The integrity, health, and legal rights of the returnees as well as the welfare of those still
   isolated must be safeguarded.
   9.6.5. After medical evaluation, debriefings, Public Affairs and legal counseling have been
   completed in accordance with the basic instruction, SAF/PA will coordinate media interviews if
   desired by the returnee.
   9.6.6. Once the individual is returned to AF control, SAF/PA will provide media updates. Updates
   will be factual, timely and straightforward. They should emphasize: (1) the health and privacy of
   the returnees and their families, and the welfare of those still isolated; (2) the need for thorough
   medical examinations and prompt medical treatment; and (3) the importance of allowing each person
   the time needed to readjust, to be reunited with relatives, to discuss their experiences with qualified
   debriefers, and to make future career plans. If pressed for more information by news media, general
   facts about the returnee that do not violate their privacy may be released at the appropriate level.
   Characterization of injuries, photographs, etc., cannot be released without consent of SAF/PA.
   9.6.7. Prior to completion of initial medical evaluations and intelligence debriefings, news media
   may be permitted to photograph returnee only if returnee agrees to such. Returnees will be
   counseled to limit remarks to general statements.
   9.6.8. Installations will make every effort to shield returnees from undesired contact with media.
   Although arrival and departure arrangements will normally be in accordance with standard
   aeromedical procedures, some situations may require the use of security forces, rope barricades, or
   special parking locations for transport aircraft. In any case, the Public Affairs representative will
   participate in the coordination and planning of crowd control, welcoming ceremonies, and VIP
   arrangements with the reintegration team chief, installation commanders, and their respective staffs.
   9.6.9. The base Public Affairs office, in coordination with the reintegration team chief, will ensure
   that all personnel involved with processing activities are briefed on the importance of courteous and
   efficient treatment of news media representatives to avoid confrontations and incidents.
   9.6.10. Provide MAJCOM history offices a copy of official press releases, media interviews, and
   publicly-released imagery for long-term historical retention.
9.7. Public Affairs Responsibilities.
   9.7.1. Secretary of the Air Force Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) will:
       9.7.1.1. Provide Public Affairs guidance to the Air Staff on matters relating to returnees.
       9.7.1.2. Provide policy, guidance and key messages, in coordination with ASD (PA), to the
       MAJCOMs concerning their Public Affairs tasks and responsibilities during processing.
       9.7.1.3. Provide the news media with the most timely and appropriate information available
       concerning specifics of travel movements of returnees. Information will be approved and/or
       coordinated with ASD (PA).
       9.7.1.4. Provide a Public Affairs escort from point of arrival in the CONUS to final processing
       destination, if required.
34                                                                             AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


        9.7.1.5. Arrange for photographic documentation of processing, within the CONUS, if deemed
        appropriate.
        9.7.1.6. Release maximum appropriate information concerning returnees through Air Force
        internal information channels, using all the means available.
        9.7.1.7. Establish a central point of contact in the Air Force Operations Group to provide liaison
        with MAJCOM Public Affairs, field Public Affairs representatives and ASD (PA) during
        reintegration processing.
     9.7.2. During reintegration, MAJCOMs will:
        9.7.2.1. Ensure experienced Public Affairs representatives are assigned to returnees at
        installations.
     9.7.3. The Public Affairs representative assigned to the returnee at each processing base will:
        9.7.3.1. Provide Public Affairs assistance to family.
        9.7.3.2. Maintain continued liaison with MAJCOM/PA on all returnee-related activities.
        9.7.3.3. Coordinate media center arrangements, as required.
     9.7.4. AFPC/PA will:
        9.7.4.1.     Provide general background information about personnel policies regarding
        POWs/MIAs. Do not divulge specifics about pay, assignments, awards and decorations unless
        first coordinated with SAF/PA.
        9.7.4.2. Coordinate key messages through SAF/PA.
9.8. Dealing with Families of Isolated Personnel. Reporters often will try to contact family members
and friends to get their reactions about the service member. National, local and military news media can
be expected to carry news of American casualties, including missing and captured personnel. Even
though the Air Force does not release family information, some reporters may determine names,
addresses or telephone numbers based on information from other sources.
     9.8.1. Considerations for the family’s decision to talk with the media:
        9.8.1.1. It’s their choice. The decision on whether to cooperate with news media is entirely up
        to them and other family members. Before they agree to be interviewed or to release
        information, they should carefully consider how any information affects their privacy and their
        loved one’s casualty status.
        9.8.1.2. They can discuss the alternatives with an Air Force Public Affairs representative.
        Public Affairs should advise and help families deal with media interest and help them with
        interviews, if the family desires to do so.
        9.8.1.3. The perceived pressure to cooperate may be intense but their right to privacy always
        takes precedence. They are under no obligation to accept media requests for information or
        interviews. In some cases, media may ―camp out‖ outside their house or contact them at work or
        while in the local area. In the past, reporters have cited the public’s ―right to know‖ and
        ―freedom of the press‖ to convince family members to cooperate. Remember, it’s their choice.
     9.8.2. Considerations for media interaction:
        9.8.2.1. Generally, it is better not to provide any personal details or family information on
        missing or captured service members because the enemy may be able to use such information to
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                              35


       cause emotional or psychological harm to them. Historically, this has been a method utilized by
       the enemy.
       9.8.2.2. Photographs or videotape of returnees could adversely impact ongoing operations and
       assist adversaries.
       9.8.2.3. PA offices can help families prepare an official statement.
       9.8.2.4. Families may designate a spokesperson, if desired.
       9.8.2.5. If families consent to an interview, they should consider the impact of their statement.
       PA offices can help families prepare for interviews, as required.
       9.8.2.6. Media should be notified of any subject matter that will not be discussed during an
       interview.
       9.8.2.7. Assume that all statements are ―on the record‖ and are available worldwide.
       9.8.2.8. Family members can end an interview at any time.
       9.8.2.9. Families should contact other relatives, friends or acquaintances who are likely to be
       reached by the media or public, to ensure family wishes are known.
9.9. Release of Personnel Information. Normally, names of deceased, missing and captured personnel
are released to news media because of the high level of public interest. However, several ground rules
are carefully observed to safeguard the privacy of service members and their families.
   9.9.1. Names are not released to the media until 24 hours after official notification to family.
   9.9.2. Release of names to media and the public may be delayed for several days if operational
   commanders judge that such release could affect ongoing search and rescue efforts or other
   operations.
   9.9.3. Information released to the news media on missing or captured service members is restricted
   to name, service, rank and age. Other information normally released on casualties, including
   military unit and home of record, are withheld because those details may be of value to captors. This
   policy is consistent with provisions of the Geneva Convention on treatment of POWs.
   9.9.4. Under no circumstances will the Air Force release any family information to the media unless
   family members specifically agree.
36                                                                        AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009

                                               ESCORTS

11.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance for escorts of returnees.
11.2. Objective. Escorts assist the returnee in taking care of personal affairs, ensure personal security
and safety, and assist in all required administrative actions.
11.3. Background. For OCONUS to CONUS transfers, COCOMs should coordinate at least one escort
for every five returnees. However, the reintegration process should not be delayed due to lack of a
proper ratio of escorts. Having no escorts, however, is not an acceptable solution.
11.4. General Guidance
   11.4.1. Escorts designated in theater may accompany returnee(s) throughout the processing when
   practical. There may be more than one escort required during reintegration due to the length of the
   process.
   11.4.2. In the U.S., MAJCOMs will ensure at least one Air Force escort disembarks with returnees
   at each location to facilitate reintegration.
   11.4.3. The ideal ratio of escorts should be one: one, returnee: escort.
   11.4.4. Escorts may include representatives from any Service.
   11.4.5. Escort(s) should have a favorable rapport with the returnee.
   11.4.6. Selection criteria for escorts:
       11.4.6.1. For enlisted returnee; a mature, senior noncommissioned officer with knowledge of
       personnel and administrative procedures. Attempt to match the returnee’s Air Force Specialty
       Code (AFSC), experience, family status, and general background, when possible.
       11.4.6.2. For officer returnee; the escort should be of equal grade, preferably with a similar
       background to that of the returnee.
       11.4.6.3. For DOD civilian or contractors; the escort should be of equal grade, preferably with a
       similar background to that of the returnee.
   11.4.7. Escorts will remain with the returnee throughout hospitalization in CONUS until the
   returnee is released for leave or duty.
   11.4.8. Escorts have no collection mission, but should report pertinent information obtained during
   casual contact to the reintegration team chief.
11.5. Escort Funding and Travel.
   11.5.1. The escort’s unit of assignment is responsible for travel funding unless a special Air
   Force/DOD fund cite has been provided.
11.6. Escort Support to Returnees Family for DOD Contractors:
   11.6.1. All courtesies and privileges authorized for military personnel extend to family of returned
   DOD contractors being processed on military installations. The Department of Defense is
   responsible for coordination of funding for DOD contractor employee family logistical support
   (travel, billeting, and meals).
38                                                                     AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009


     11.6.2. Assign an escort officer to assist family members visiting returned DOD contractor
     employees during processing.
11.7. Escort after Action. Reintegration team chief will ensure that all escorts prepare after-action
reports. These reports should include: major events and activities, date/timeline, problem areas,
returnee/escort relationship, on-going and incomplete actions, and recommendations for improving the
procedures of this instruction. A copy of each after-action report will be forwarded through command
channels to AF/A3O-AS, Washington, D.C. 20314, within 30 days after termination of escort duties.
AFI10-3001 21 APRIL 2009                                                                            39

        location after leave solely for further personnel processing.
        12.4.1.15. Continue to monitor and update duty status changes once AFPC/DPWCM has
        initially updated the member’s duty status. Coordinate with AFPC/DPWCM if there are any
        problems updating subsequent duty status.
        12.4.1.16. Ensure dedicated force support personnel are provided to the reintegration team chief
        for accomplishing and coordinating the various military/civilian personnel actions.

nationals, local citizens, or third-country nationals, but will not include foreign governments or
representatives of foreign governments that sell to the DOD, a DOD component, or foreign corporations
owned wholly by foreign governments. Only contractors who are U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens who
have an independent right to U.S. residency are eligible for the reintegration process. Non-U.S. citizens
who have no independent right to U.S. residency may be reintegrated to their host country. (Ref: DODI
3020.41, Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany the US Armed Forces)
Duty Status, Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN)—When personnel are reported as missing, their
initial condition is normally reported as ―duty, status, whereabouts unknown. DUSTWUN is a
temporary condition until the conditions surrounding the missing person are verified. Commanders
assign an administrative status such as evading, missing, captured, hostage, or peacetime governmental
detainee.

participating in U.S. sponsored military activity or mission and are, or may be, in a situation where they
must survive, evade, resist, or escape.
Missing in Action (MIA)—Members deployed with the force whose status is unknown due to hostile
action.
Peacetime Governmental Detainee—Members that are forcibly held by a foreign power when no

individuals detained due to activities unrelated to military operations.)
Prisoner of War (POW)—A person as defined in Convention III, Articles IV and V of the Geneva
Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. In particular, one who,
while engaged in combat under orders of his or her government, is captured by enemy armed forces. As
such, he or she is entitled to the combatant’s privilege of immunity from the municipal law of the
capturing state for warlike acts, which do not amount to breaches of the law of armed conflict. Also
called POW, members of the U.S. Armed Forces, civilian employees of the DOD, or American Citizen
(AMCIT) employees of a contractor of the DOD forcibly held by an enemy during an armed conflict or
military operations other than war in which the United States is involved.

                STATEMENT TO BE READ AND DELIVERED TORETURNEES

A3.1. U.S. service members remain unaccounted for and military operations continue. Enemy forces
may capture other U.S. service members. Additionally, investigations continue into the circumstances
of your capture and the conditions of your detention. Information that you may disclose may jeopardize
the safe return of your fellow service members and adversely affect the ongoing investigations. At this
time, do not communicate about the circumstances and events leading up to and during your capture or
about investigations into these issues with anyone who does not have an official need to know. This
restriction includes but is not limited to communications about your treatment during isolation, the
actions, condition or status of any individual with you at the time of or during your capture, any aspect
of the ongoing investigations, any aspect of your debriefings, and the names of your physicians.
A3.2. Individuals with an official need to know include those with an appropriate security clearance
who are conducting your debriefings, investigating the circumstances of your capture and detention,
providing you counseling and medical treatment, your servicing Public Affairs official, your attorney,
and your commander. If you are unsure whether an individual has an official need to know, you should
seek clarification from your commander or your servicing Staff Judge Advocate.
A3.3. You may talk about your personal health status, the quality of care provided by the U.S. military
health care system, your unit of assignment and AFSC responsibilities, your personal and family
background, your concern for your fellow service members killed in action, missing or wounded
(although you should not name specific individuals), and your future career plans. If you are unsure
about whether you may talk about a subject, you should obtain guidance from your commander or
servicing Public Affairs official.
A3.4. There is no requirement to speak with the media and neither you nor your family will be required
to do so. Should you or your family desire to engage the media, Public Affairs officials are available to
help you. You and your family should consult your servicing Public Affairs official if you choose to
engage in any media activity.
A3.5. Based upon your recent experiences, you and your family soon may be offered gifts from well-
meaning sources ranging from individuals to companies. You may also receive offers for the ―sale‖ of
your story. At this time, you may not accept offers for the sale of your story. You and your family may
accept gifts that are offered to you based upon a purely personal relationship (i.e., family and friends).
You may also accept gifts that are of minimal value ($20 or less) or that are sentimental or
presentational in nature from other sources (e.g., cards, certificates, plaques). Before you or your family
accepts anything other than this from someone other than family and friends, you should consult your
appropriate agency or employer ethical advisor or the legal office.
