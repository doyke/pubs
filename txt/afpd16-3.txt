the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 4110.01E, Joint Materiel Priorities and Allocation.
This directive applies to all Air Force personnel, including Air National Guard and Air Force
Reserve, who review, validate, approve, and manage the use of FAD ratings. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of primary
responsibility using the Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route

1. Purpose. This publication establishes Air Force policy governing the assignment of
Force/Activity Designator (FAD) ratings for prioritization of Air Force units, activities, projects,
and programs. The Department of Defense (DoD) governs the priority allocation of resources
through the Uniform Materiel Management Issue Priority System (UMMIPS). The UMMIPS
uses FADs in conjunction with Urgency of Need Designators (UND) to establish a matrix of
priorities for supply requisitioning and the transport system. A FAD is a rating, indicated by a
Roman numeral (I through V), assigned by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), or the Military Services to indicate the mission priority of a unit,
program, activity, or project with respect to national objectives set by the President of the United
States. FADs are ranked with FAD I being the highest, and FAD V being the lowest priority.
2. Policy.
     2.1. In accordance with DoD 4140.1-R and CJCSI 4110.01E, the Chief of Staff of the Air
     Force (CSAF) is delegated authority to assign FADs II through V to assigned units, activities,
     projects, and programs. This AFPD further delegates this authority to the Deputy Chief of
     Staff, Strategic Plans and Programs (AF/A8). FAD I recommendations are made by the
     CSAF.
     2.2. In accordance with CJCSI 4110.01E, the Joint Materiel Priorities and Allocation Board
     (JMPAB) is the sole agency charged with performing duties for the CJCS in matters that
     establish materiel priorities or allocate resources. The Air Force member of the JMPAB is
     the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (AF/A4/7).
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     3.1. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategic Plans and Programs (AF/A8):
        3.1.1. Administers the FAD II through V program for initial assignment or change
        requests for Air Force units, activities, projects, and programs.
        3.1.2. Obtains CSAF concurrence of FAD I request packages for Air Force units,
        activities, projects, and programs, then submits to the JMPAB for action.
     3.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (AF/A4/7):
        3.2.1. Represents the Air Force as its member of the JMPAB.
        3.2.2. Coordinates an AF position with AF/A3/5, AF/A10 (on Nuclear Enterprise
        equities) and AF/A8 on FAD assignment requests submitted to the JMPAB by sister
        Services, Combatant Commands, U.S. Coast Guard, and foreign countries for
        establishment and modification of FADs.

Force/Activity Designators (FADs)—A Roman numeral (I to V) that the Secretary of Defense,
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or a DoD component assigns to a unit, organization,
installation, project, or program to indicate its relative mission essentiality. The FAD is an
integral part of the UMMIPS. FADs used in conjunction with UNDs to establish a matrix of
priorities used for supply requisitions. FADs are ranked with FAD I being the highest and FAD
V being the lowest priority.

Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS)—UMMIPS sets
priorities for the issuance and movement of materiel. The system enables supply customers to
use one of 15 priority designators when requisitioning supply items. These 15 priority
designators are based on two components: the UND defines the relative importance of the item
ordered to the unit’s mission and the FAD defines the relative importance of the unit placing the
order.
Urgency of Need Designator (UND)—Indicates the importance of a requisition relative to its
mission and is assigned by the customer or requisitioner.
