Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), etc.) checklists. The checklists will be inspected during
the unit/branch self inspection and during the annual formal SAV conducted by 71LRS/CEX.
3.11.13. (Added) (VANCEAFB) There are two forms of Sheltering. The first type is called
sheltering which is for natural disasters; specifically, those that will give little to no advanced
warning (i.e. a tornado). In these cases, Vance AFB personnel are to follow the procedures
outlined in the Vance AFB Emergency Management Family Guide or other Vance AFB specific
information program pamphlets, brochures, and visual aids. After a natural disaster has passed,
and the Wing/CC has determined the need for a base shelter, the Shelter Management Guide
within the FSS should be referenced. All information program products are provided on the
Vance AFB EM CoP and SharePoint under the 71 Logistics Readiness Squadron/ Emergency
Management Information Program. The second type is Shelter-in-Place (SIP) which is for
HAZMAT/CBRNE events in which contamination is present and personnel do not have the
capability of evacuating. In these cases, Vance AFB personnel are to follow the procedures
outlined in their facilityâ€™s SIP plan. The SIP plan will identify a readily accessible location that
can be secured in such a manner that will minimize the threat of the hazard during a chemical
incident. Refer to the CEMP 10-2 for additional information on SIP.
3.11.13.1. (Added) (VANCEAFB) A SIP plan needs to be created by all Vance AFB facility
managers for each building that they own; unless, the building will never be occupied by
personnel. The plan needs to be sent to 71 LRS/CEX for approval. The approved SIP plan will
be taught by the facility manager, EM Rep, or Commander to all personnel to ensure that
everyone knows where to go when directed by leadership or response personnel.
