                                       POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction. Radar sensors and systems play a vital role in tactical, air defense and air traffic con-
trol. Many special types of configurations of radars are installed in numerous operational environments. It
is imperative the capabilities and limitations of each radar sensor, command and control (C2) and system
be determined so they can be configured to provide optimum performance and effectively meet their oper-
ational requirements.
1.1. (ACC) Radar Systems. A transportable radar system is transported on mobilizers, aircraft or trucks.
A Fixed Radar System is permanently installed at a fixed location. ). A Tethered Aerostat Radars is a
lighter-than-air balloon containing a look-down radar surveillance system. The radar improves the detec-
tion and tracking of low-level targets over ground-based radars. Target information is forwarded automat-
ically to the appropriate Air Defense Sectors (ADSs).
   1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Radar Coverage Indicator (RCI). A mechanical computer device which pre-
   dicts aircraft detection/fade range as a function of aircraft reflectivity, antenna electrical tilt, absolute
   flight altitude, and horizon screening angle.

1.2. Policy. The Air Force policy is to ensure tactical and strategic air defense ground radars, C2 systems,
and electronic resources are installed, maintained, and operated in a high state of readiness to provide a
quick reaction to the threat of both limited and general wars. Ground electronics evaluation provides man-
agement with a tool for determining the capability of each radar to detect, identify, track and control air-
craft; determine aircraft height; provide ground-to-air communications; and to maximize operational
readiness and flight safety. In addition, ground electronics evaluations determine the configuration for
optimal performance in a dynamic radar environment. Lastly, the C2 system evaluation further ensures
the radar sensors are properly integrated into C2 system and the C2 system properly processes tracks and
displays the radar data.

                                            REQUIREMENTS

2.1. An initial baseline evaluation is required as soon as possible after a unit completes installation accep-
tance testing and resolves major exceptions. The radar should be operationally stable and properly con-
nected with its control center. A baseline evaluation and integration to the control center is required
before the radar is fully mission capable. Mobile radar systems may require a baseline evaluation if their
deployed location becomes fixed.
   2.1.1. Re-baseline and integration into the control center is necessary following major repairs, major
   modifications, or permanent radar relocation or as specified in AFMAN 11-225, United States Stan-
   dard Flight Inspection Manual.
   2.1.2. A baseline evaluation, in conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
   required prior to FAA commissioning radars in the Joint Surveillance System.
   2.1.3. Monitor performance of previously baselined fixed radars on a continuous basis. Perform a
   special evaluation when degradation is indicated.

2.2. Developmental Testing (DT)/Operational Testing (OT) Taskings:
   2.2.1. Support 46 TS for DT.
   2.2.2. Support 605 TS for OT.
   2.2.3. Support AFOTEC for OT.
   2.2.4. Support 133 TS for DT and OT.

2.3. The 84 RADES shall certify new radar systems prior to integration into the Atmospheric Early
Warning System (AEWS) when certification services are requested by NORAD and approved by ACC/
DOY and SCW for scheduling.
2.3. (ACC) Evaluation Organization. The 84 Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES) is the primary evalu-
ation agency for all phases of USAF transportable and fixed ground-based radar systems. The 84 RADES
has technical responsibility for all phases of radar testing and evaluation. Its primary responsibility is to
perform baseline/special and system evaluations of radars, including joint evaluations of Joint Surveil-
lance System (JSS) sites with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel. However, the 84
RADES also conducts system evaluations of multiple sensors and assists with C2 systems integration and
continuous performance monitoring.
   2.3.1. (Added-ACC) Evaluation flight support requirements will be identified by the 84 RADES.
   Aircraft utilized for these flights will be restricted to those meeting radar evaluation criteria. Upon
   receipt of a request for evaluation flights, the flying Wing will designate the unit to furnish the evalu-
   ation aircraft and issue appropriate directives. The Wing will identify the type of aircraft to be used for
   a radar evaluation as soon as possible to provide necessary planning data to the organizations for route
   scheduling and airspace acquisition.

2.4. Manpower. HQ AFPC assigns personnel to the 84 RADES to conduct radar evaluation. Normally,
enlisted personnel will have a 5-skill level. Upon upgrade, the 84 RADES Commander will ensure the
8                                                            AFI13-101_ACC_I 30 AUGUST 2006


special experience identifier is in the member’s records and ensure an assignment availability code is
annotated IAW the ACC stabilized tour guides.

                                       TYPES OF EVALUATIONS

3.1. Baseline Evaluation. This evaluation is performed to:
   3.1.1. Determine optimum configuration of adjustable and selectable features (software and hard-
   ware), capabilities and limitations, including airspace coverage. It is tailored to individual radar site
   and missions and includes effects of weather and terrain on detection and tracking performance. Ded-
   icated flights are required to make this assessment.
   3.1.2. Provide a performance database, determine operational parameters, and airspace coverage as a
   basis for inclusion in the RADES electronic monitoring evaluation system.

3.2. Special Evaluation. This evaluation is performed to:
   3.2.1. Assist operating organization in isolating the causes of substandard performance.
   3.2.2. Determine the effects of proposed and existing modifications on the operational capability and
   recommend configuration.
   3.2.3. Determine the best site location or positioning of a radar and the optimum setting of adjustable
   features for use under varying conditions.
   3.2.4. Support radar acquisitions, developmental and operational test and evaluation programs, and
   system integration.

3.3. System Evaluation. This evaluation determines how well multiple sensors integrate into a central
facility or system to include assessment of the radar inputs processing portion of the central system; i.e.,
radar message handling, tracker and display functionality.

3.4. Continuous Performance Monitoring and Evaluation : A continuous and near real-time evalua-
tion process performed on previously baselined radars. The data collected during the baseline evaluation
is used for initial pass/fail criteria and establishes a baseline for performance for each individual radar sys-
tem. This evaluation is performed to:
3.4. (ACC) To achieve maximum effectiveness, a periodic evaluation program must be established to
frequently sample the radar’s performance. The sampling frequency will be based on the operational per-
formance history of the radar and reliability check results of search and IFF/SIF systems to include Modes
2, 3, C and 4. The program will provide for periodic evaluations for mobile and fixed radar systems.
   3.4.1. Continuously monitor/assess radar performance based on short- and long-term trends.
   3.4.2. Continuously monitor radar data quality for error-free communication service.
   3.4.3. Detect radar performance deviations from established standards.
   3.4.4. Alert users of system effectiveness and deterioration in detection capability.
   3.4.5. Allow for corrective action to be effected before complete system failure.
   3.4.6. (Added-ACC) Fixed radar PREPs are performed by 84 RADES personnel assigned to each
   ADS. The program will be tailored for the JSS/ADS mission requirements, will provide an assessment

     of radar system effectiveness, and will record any deterioration of mission capability. The 84 RADES
     PREP OLs will:
        3.4.6.1. (Added-ACC) Record, process, and analyze radar and beacon data from each site at least
        biweekly using PREP radar analysis programs IAW 84 RADES EOI and, if necessary, Attach-
        ment 3 (Added), ERS Procedures.
        3.4.6.2. (Added-ACC) Provide meaningful and timely performance and trend data through
        monthly reports to the ADS and 84 RADES/DO.

        vice in support of the JSS/SOCC mission.
        3.4.6.4. (Added-ACC) Contact the Air Surveillance Technician (AST) or FAA Systems Engineer
        (SE) to ascertain the current site equipment settings when conducting regularly scheduled PREP
        evaluations.
     3.4.7. (Added-ACC) Units will establish a periodic evaluation program. This program as a minimum
     will include the following:
        3.4.7.1. (Added-ACC) Provide an assessment of radar system effectiveness, and record any dete-
        rioration of mission capability. Periodic evaluations will be carried out during the period of unit
        deployment as well as during in-garrison operations.
        3.4.7.2. (Added-ACC) Subjective Assessment: The Operations Officer or designated PREP
        Officer/NCO will ensure radar quality. This will be based on analysis, observations and informa-
        tion gathered on aircraft tracking, detection, permanent echoes, ground returns, clutter, radar per-
        formance parameters, weather conditions, and radar height readouts.
        3.4.7.3. (Added-ACC) The assessment of the mobile radar unit will be made at the beginning of
        each operations shift by the PREP Officer or designated representative. The single word PREP
        assessment (satisfactory, marginal, etc.) will be recorded in the Operations Logbook, as appropri-
        ate IAW Attachment 3 (Added).
            3.4.7.3.1. (Added-ACC) A subjective assessment of radar/system capabilities will be made
            utilizing information gathered IAW the periodic evaluation checklist. A minimum of four con-
            secutive observation readings will be used for each subjective assessment. The single word
            assessment from section 2 of the checklist best describing system performance will be indi-
            cated on the form and likewise included in the log entry recording checklist completion.
            3.4.7.3.2. (Added-ACC) The Periodic Evaluation Checklist (Attachment 2 (Added)) will be
            maintained on file for a minimum of 90 days after completion and then destroyed IAW DoD
            5200.1R/AFI 31-401.
            3.4.7.3.3. (Added-ACC) Mode 4 Reliability Checks. The Operations Officer will ensure the
            Mode 4 reliability checks are performed IAW AFI 13-1MCS, Volume 3.
     3.4.8. (Added-ACC) When unit maintenance personnel cannot determine the cause of equipment
     performance problems, a special equipment evaluation may be requested IAW AFI 13-101.
     3.4.9. (Added-ACC) Evaluation Reports.
        3.4.9.1. (Added-ACC) Baseline, special, and system evaluation reports will use the format and
        criteria established in 84 RADES EOI guidelines, as appropriate.
AFI13-101_ACC_I 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                          11


     3.4.9.2. (Added-ACC) The baseline evaluation report describes operational requirements and
     equipment used to meet these requirements, sitting characteristics, coverage capabilities, and lim-
     itations. It also includes recommendations for the most effective configuration of adjustable and
     selectable equipment features.
     3.4.9.3. (Added-ACC) Classification of the evaluation report will be IAW the appropriate secu-
     rity classification guide.
     3.4.9.4. (Added-ACC) Evaluation reports generated by the 84 RADES will be distributed IAW
     the distribution list maintained at 84 RADES. Agencies can request inclusion on the distribution
     list through 84 RADES.
     3.4.9.5. (Added-ACC) Baseline evaluation reports will be retained until superseded. Special
     evaluation reports will be retained with the most recent baseline evaluation report for radars that
     have had a baseline evaluation.
  3.4.10. (Added-ACC) Site Survey. 84 RADES will assist with radar sitting surveys for fixed or
  transportable radars as requested by ACC/A3Y/A6O and funded. These surveys will normally be
  used to determine the theoretical radar coverage capability for each location (e.g., coverage diagrams,
  screening data, etc.). The logistical, communications, and other concerns as well as final site selection
  are the responsibility of the requester/higher headquarters.

                                84 RADES OL ESR PROCEDURES
A3.1. (Added-ACC) Any failures of greater than 20 percent of the established standards dictate the fol-
lowing action: Re-evaluate immediately using a new recording and analysis assessment.
   A3.1.1. (Added-ACC) If failure does not occur again or does occur but can be explained, then no fur-
   ther action is required.
   A3.1.2. (Added-ACC) If failures occur again with no explanations, i.e., AST, FAA system engineer,
   site technician, and 84 RADES have been consulted without a positive fix action, the OL will request
   through the AST that an ESR be opened. The ESR will remain open until radar analysis program
   results indicate performance capabilities are restored to normal levels, logical explanations have been
   found, or AST/ASO determine a change of status is warranted.
A3.2. (Added-ACC) Any failures of less than 20 percent of the established standard dictate the follow-
ing action: Analyze and assess the past 30 days radar analysis results to determine degraded performance
trends.
   A3.2.1. (Added-ACC) If the degraded performance is not a trend but incidental, then no further
   action is required.
   A3.2.2. (Added-ACC) If a degraded performance is discovered (i.e., 15 of past 30 days have failed)
   and there are no explanations, i.e., AST, FAA system engineer, site technician, and 84 RADES have
   been consulted without a positive fix action, OL will request through the AST that an ESR be opened.
   The ESR will remain open until radar analysis program results indicate performance capabilities are
   restored, logical explanations have been found, or AST/ASO determine a change of status is war-
   ranted.
