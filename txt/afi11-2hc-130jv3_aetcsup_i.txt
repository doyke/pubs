                                          Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The ACC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism
which keeps the ACC Commander (COMACC) informed of the current status of ACC forces
while enabling the Wing Commander (WG/CC) or Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) to
exercise control over day-to-day operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). ACC is designated as the controlling agency for assigned
Air Force aircraft, while theater commands have OPCON of theater-based assets. In practice,
responsibility for planning and executing ACC missions is routinely delegated to the WG or
OG/CC. The WG/CC or OG/CC, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold missions through
the command post supporting the wing. In the event that assigned forces undergo a CHOP,
responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining
command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan (OPLAN),
Operational Order (OPORD), or deployment or execution order. NOTE: For certain close-hold
activities, security considerations may compel the WG/CC or OG/CC to shift mission monitoring
responsibilities from the command post to another wing agency. The WG/CC or OG/CC will
establish procedures for the responsible agency to monitor mission progress and advise the
MAJCOM/A3 and Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) as appropriate.
2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center
monitors all ACC aircraft that move to, from, or between Outside the Continental United States
(OCONUS) off-station locations. Key components of the ACC C2 system are the Global
Command and Control System (GCCS) and the various C2 facilities at theater and wing
locations. When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the Command
Center may obtain additional information from situation reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status
Reports (DSR). The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that
are not close-hold in nature and have not had operational control changed to another command.
   2.3.1. The respective unit command post tracks Continental United States (CONUS)
   movements of their aircraft based on aircrew reports.
   2.3.2. Host wing command posts telephonically relay information on OCONUS movements
   of ACC aircraft to the ACC Command Center. The host wing command posts receive their
   data directly from aircrew or via the enroute facility’s local command post.
   2.3.3. Mission commander or PIC flight reporting duties:
       2.3.3.1. Missions at Bases with a C2 Facility. At least 30 minutes prior to landing,
       mission commanders, PICs, or their designated crewmember will relay the following
       information to the applicable C2 facility: call signs, mission numbers, and estimated time
       of arrival (ETA), maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing,
       the mission commander or PIC will contact the C2 facility with ground handling
       requirements and departure information. In addition, CONUS based crews operating
       OCONUS must keep their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff
       and landing times, projected takeoff times, and other related information. Home station

        no later than 30 minutes after the event.
        2.3.3.2.2. If unable to contact ACC command center or Deployed Tanker Airlift
        Control Center via HF/SSB, retain information for submission via voice to the
        controlling C2 center (CCC) when contact is reestablished.
        2.3.3.2.3. Restrict HF transmissions to operational traffic, i.e., movement reporting,
        itinerary revisions, maintenance status, flight plan information, weather and/or
        aircraft emergencies, or other important flight information, as appropriate.
        2.3.3.2.4. If experiencing problems complying with these procedures, report
        problems to the next CCC contacted. The CCC transmits the reporting problems to
        the ACC Command Center.
     2.3.3.3. Enroute Reporting. Enroute reports are not required unless specified in an
     OPORD/OPLAN or other mission directive.
        2.3.3.3.1. Unless shorter flight legs dictate, when approximately 3 hours from
        destination, contact the destination, CCC, or if no CCC is available, contact the ACC
        command center via HF radio. Upon initial contact, confirm your arrival message has
        been received and update your ETA. If your arrival message has been received, no

   2.5.6. Charged with keeping the applicable C2 or executing agencies informed of mission
   progress.
   2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission
   commander (see paragraphs 2.3.3 and 2.4.)
2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The agency with OPCON or the PIC may make the final
decision to delay a mission when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or
continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC. If
the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved
so that the mission can operate safely. Do not alert another PIC and crew to take the same
mission under the same conditions.
   2.6.1. The commander with OPCON must authorize diverting or rerouting a mission, except
   in an emergency or when required by enroute or terminal weather conditions or facilities. In
   the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the mission commander or
   PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
       2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for
       determining if destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and
       aircrew. The PIC should verify that this is the case.
       2.6.1.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations
       that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
   2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 center will provide the PIC
   enroute weather, existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notice to Airmen
   (NOTAM), and appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions
   Report (ASRR). If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while enroute, the PIC will
   coordinate with the C2 center for other suitable alternates. The C2 center will coordinate
   with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival. The PIC is the final
   authority on selecting a suitable alternate.
2.7. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD)
to cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, incorporates the appropriate directive
and provides uniform policies and procedures to be followed concerning support provided to
federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and
restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law
enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from
civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels.

qualification in that crew position, mission, and mission design series (MDS) aircraft to perform
duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.1.1. Basic proficiency crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any non-mission
   sortie and on unilateral training, joint training, and exercises mission sorties when receiving
   mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified instructor or
   flight examiner in their respective crew position. NOTE: Senior leaders who complete a
   Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification)
   or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position
   when under direct instructor supervision.
   3.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on
   any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the
   readiness of each mission capable crewmember to perform duties.
   3.1.3. Non-current or unqualified pilots may perform crew duties only on designated training
   or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor pilot (IP) or flight
   examiner pilot. Direct IP supervision is required during critical phases of flight. NOTE:
   Critical phases of flight are defined as takeoff, approach and landing, and all tactical mission
   events.
   3.1.4. Other non-current or unqualified crewmembers may serve as a primary aircrew
   member on any mission under the direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight
   examiner. Except as noted in Table 3.1, the student crewmember and the instructor or flight
   examiner fulfill the requirement for one primary position.
3.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement is specified in Table 3.1. Unit
commanders may authorize reduced crew complements as noted in Table 3.1. The waiver
authority for any additional crew complement reductions, down to the minimum crew
complement specified in the flight manual, is the OG/CC.

specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances, but may be used to relieve short-term
qualified manpower shortfalls.
   3.5.1. Unless specified in a MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):
       3.5.1.1. Aircraft ownership will not be transferred.
       3.5.1.2. The unit with operational control of the mission is responsible for publication
       and maintenance of the aircraft flight authorizations for each mission flown by the
       aircraft.
       3.5.1.3. Crewmembers will be qualified in HC-130J aircraft. Differences training may
       be required between different series aircraft. See AFI 11-2HC-130JV1.
       3.5.1.4. Crewmembers will follow operational procedures defined in 11-2HC-130J VOL
       3, AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3 HC-130, and the applicable technical orders for the MDS.
       3.5.1.5. The MAJCOM with aircraft ownership will retain all flight and ground mishap
       reporting responsibility.
   3.5.2. Approval Authority.
       3.5.2.1. The OG/CC is the approval authority for interfly on aircraft under the OG/CC’s
       control.
       3.5.2.2. Each participating MAJCOM/A3 must approve interfly for contingency
       operations.
3.6. Intrafly. Intrafly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members from separate
units under the same MAJCOM to accomplish flying missions. Normally, intrafly should be
used only to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls.
   3.6.1. The OG/CC possessing the aircraft is the approval authority for intrafly between units.
   3.6.2. As a minimum, crewmembers will be qualified in HC-130J aircraft, as well as systems
   or configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission. If non-current, comply with
   paragraphs 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3.
3.7. Flight Duty Period, Crew Duty Period, and Crew Rest Restrictions. See AFI 11-202V3
and ACC Supplement. The Flight Duty Period (FDP) falls within the constraints of the Crew
Duty Period (CDP). The addition of CDP is intended for a basic crew to complete aircrew duties
at the aircraft after engine shutdown (e.g. cargo loading/offloading, refueling, etc.). NOTE:
Waiver authority for paragraph 3.7 is MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent, unless otherwise
noted.
3.7. (AETC)Flight Duty Period, Crew Duty Period, and Crew Rest Restrictions. If the
aircrew is not airborne within 4 hours after scheduled departure time, the training sortie will be
canceled and the crew rescheduled. However, the PIC may request a 2 hour extension (up to 6
hours). That extension must be approved by the OG/CC.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period. FDP is the period that starts when an aircrew reports for a
   mission, briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end of
   the mission, mission leg, or a series of missions.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     23


       3.7.1.1. The basic FDP is 16 hours providing no mission events, helicopter air-to-air
       refueling (HAAR) below 3,000 ft AGL, pilot proficiency training, air to air refueling
       (AAR) or functional check flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no HAAR
       at or above 3,000 ft AGL are accomplished after 14 hours. If both autopilots are not
       operational, it cannot be coupled to the flight director or its use is denied for more than 4
       hours, the FDP will be 12 hours. If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to the next
       scheduled stop and then comply with the basic FDP limitations.
       3.7.1.2. The augmented FDP is 20 hours providing no mission events, HAAR below
       3,000 ft AGL, pilot proficiency training, AAR or FCFs are accomplished after 16 hours
       and no HAAR at or above 3,000 ft AGL are accomplished after 18 hours. If the both
       autopilots are not operational, it cannot be coupled to the flight director, or its use is
       denied for more than 8 hours, the FDP will be 16 hours.
           3.7.1.2.1. Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical
           phases of flight. Normally, 30 minutes prior to initiating the checklist for an event
           will allow the new crewmember time to acclimate. EXCEPTION: For training
           missions instructors will plan and brief crew changes to safely maximize training
           objectives.
           3.7.1.2.2. Minimum in-flight crew rest facilities will be 2 litters.
           3.7.1.2.3. FDP length will be based on the mission to be performed. For example, if
           the planned mission duration is 15 hours from show time to termination, then a basic
           FDP is appropriate even if the crew is augmented. Once established, a basic FDP will
           not be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition.
       3.7.1.3. Time spent traveling as a passenger on commercial or military transportation in
       excess of 4 hours counts as part of the duty period. Official duty travel for personnel in
       official military/civilian status will count toward the duty period. For further information
       reference AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplement.
   3.7.2. Crew Duty Period. CDP is the period that starts when an aircrew reports for a
   mission, briefing, or other official duty and ends at the completion of aircrew duties at the
   aircraft. Maximum CDP is 18 hours for a basic aircrew and 22 hours for an augmented
   aircrew.
   3.7.3. PICs may extend the FDP and/or CDP by up to 2 hours on a mission in progress.
   PICs should attempt to comply with the waiver authority in AFI 11-202V3. If this option is
   exercised, PICs must coordinate with C2 agencies so that downstream activities are not
   adversely affected. Missions will not be scheduled to exceed the maximum FDP in this
   paragraph. PICs must carefully weigh all factors affecting their crew before electing to
   extend the FDP and/or CDP.
3.8. Alert Duty. See AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplement. Alert duty is defined as any
period during which an alert crew is on call to perform a specific mission. Aircrew will be
placed into crew rest prior to alert status. Upon entering crew rest, an aircrew will be given an
expected alert assumption time. Alert aircrews must be prepared to respond at any time during
the alert period.
24                                   AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


  3.8.1. Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the
  mission. Alert crews will be readily available in a location that allows the crew to meet the
  required time to launch from notification. Suitable facilities include adequate sleeping
  accommodations for the entire crew, unless at home station. Publish flight authorizations for
  the alert crew to cover the entire alert duty period.
  3.8.2. The alert duty period will begin at a scheduled time determined by the unit/mission
  commander. Provide aircrew members 12 hours crew rest prior to alert duty. The
  unit/mission commander will determine the length of the alert period, not to exceed 72 hours.
  An alert period may be extended up to a maximum of 7 days with MAJCOM/A3 (or
  deployed equivalent) approval provided aircrew members receive a 24-hour recovery period
  prior to the next alert. Pre-departure crew rest is waived for flight surgeons or medical
  technicians who are on alert duty for urgent Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions.
  3.8.3. The FDP will begin when the aircrew shows for flight duties. Crews may complete
  initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, preflight, engine run of their alert aircraft)
  without starting their FDP. This time should not exceed 3 hours. If the aircrew is alerted
  while performing initial alert activities, the FDP will be computed from the time
  crewmembers first arrived. NOTE: Alert response exercises that terminate prior to engine
  start do not start the FDP when they occur during normal waking hours.
      3.8.3.1. The alert crew will not normally be used as a preflight or engine run crew for
      aircraft other than their alert aircraft. Alert crews will not perform other official duties
      (e.g., additional duties, commander’s call, safety meeting, etc.) within their alert period.
      EXCEPTION: During normal waking hours, alert aircrew may mission plan at the
      discretion of the PIC.
      3.8.3.2. A daily update briefing may be accomplished without starting the FDP. This
      briefing should include weather, local NOTAMS, latest Flight Crew Information File
      (FCIF) information, special instructions, and any other appropriate items. The PIC
      determines which crewmembers attend the briefing.
      3.8.3.3. An alert crew should not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-
      hour alert periods. The alert crew will receive 12 hours of pre-mission crew rest between
      the first and second alert periods. Following completion of the second 72-hour alert
      period, the alert crew or crewmember will receive a minimum of 24 hours crew rest prior
      to reassuming alert status.
  3.8.4. Flying the Alert Crew.
      3.8.4.1. If the alert crew is launched and returns with FDP remaining, they may be
      launched again within the constraints of that FDP. Numerous circumstances may arise
      that affect the decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated on
      an individual basis.
      3.8.4.2. If the alert crew completes 12 consecutive hours of crew rest between flights or
      official duties within the 72 hour alert period, the previous FDP no longer applies and the
      cycle can be started anew provided the crew does not remain on alert for more than 72
      hours from their initial assumption of alert.

   3.8.5. Flying Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The crew chief is responsible to the PIC.
   The PIC, in conjunction with the enroute station chief of maintenance, will determine how
   long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have
   the opportunity to sleep 8 hours in each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
   Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
3.9. TDY Crew Rest/Post Deployment Stand Down.
   3.9.1. All primary/deadhead crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to be away from
   home station or rotational base for more than 16 hours or recover away from home station
   should be notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12 hours are not
   considered crew rest, but are designed to allow crewmembers time to resolve personal
   affairs. During these first 12 hours, a crewmember may perform limited non-flying duties.
   The second 12 hour period is inviolate crew rest.
   3.9.2. Post-mission crew rest begins upon the final return of an individual to home station
   and runs continuously until completed. Post-mission crew rest must be completed before
   starting the 12 hour pre-departure crew rest period for a subsequent mission. Do not require
   a crewmember to get immunizations, engage in ground training, perform standby or squadron
   duties, or perform any other activity that would encroach upon crew rest. Waiver authority
   for post-mission crew rest is the OG/CC or theater commander. Waiver requests for post-
   mission crew rest are considered on a case by case basis only with the concurrence of the
   individual crewmember.
      3.9.2.1. Compute post-mission crew rest at the rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of
      temporary duty (TDY), not to exceed 72 hours. Note: Not applicable to students in
      formal schools listed in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools.

                                            Chapter 4

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. The objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for
launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable, FMC). However, under specific
circumstances, some missions can be safely operated without all equipment being operational.
Using the following policies, the PIC is the final authority in determining an overall status of an
aircraft. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the discrepancy is entered in the AFTO
Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; use the following maintenance
identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe
   aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated Mission Essential (ME) by the
   PIC.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally cleared
   at home station.    NOTE: Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification centers, or
   depots unless all instruments are installed and operative.    NOTE: If the PIC elects to
   operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements (i.e.
   revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) prior to flight
   with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on
   missions.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL sets forth command policy regarding
equipment/systems necessary to continue or complete missions after the aircraft is released from
the responsible maintenance organization. Equipment/systems not listed in Table 4.1 through
Table 4.23 shall be considered required for flight without exception. This list cannot anticipate
all combinations of failures and contingencies, and is not intended for continued operations, over
an indefinite period, with failed or degraded equipment/systems.
   4.2.1. PIC Responsibility. PICs must account for the possibility of additional failures when
   accepting aircraft with inoperative equipment/systems. A PIC accepting an aircraft (one
   mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not commit that PIC (or a
   different PIC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a waiver
through the appropriate C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agency: 1) nature of request,
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     27


2) individual crew member qualifications, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, and paragraph. Initiate waiver
requests as soon as possible. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. SQ/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority for
   active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes Operational
   Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. Other than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance Technical Order (T.O.), etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2
   channels to notify the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an
   extended response time.
4.4. Deviations. If beyond C2 communication capability, or it is necessary to protect the crew
or aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
may deviate IAW paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to
appropriate MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours. Units shall collect background information and
submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.5. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request, at any time in the decision process, technical
support and additional assistance from their home unit, MAJCOM staff, and maintenance
representatives.
4.6. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station.
   4.6.1. The chief of maintenance, senior maintenance officer, or chief of the Air Force
   Materiel Command (AFMC) repair team must first authorize the release.
   4.6.2. After maintenance release, contact the appropriate authority for flight authorization.
   NOTE: One-time flights authorized in the MEL require OG/CC approval. Any one-time
   flight request not listed in the MEL requires MAJCOM/A3 approval.
   4.6.2. (AETC) AETC delegates MEL waiver authority to OG/CC.
   4.6.3. The maintenance release, flight authorization, and the PICs concurrence are all
   required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination.
4.7. Fuel System. The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity
indicators is fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible; however, flight
crews must consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range, should further degradation
occur. The following paragraphs and MEL provide guidelines for degraded fuel system
operations under most circumstances.
   4.7.1. Crossfeed Operations. Begin crossfeed operation when the symmetrically opposite
   quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 lbs (inboards) and 2,500 lbs (outboards)
       4.7.1.1. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative indicator
       or it’s symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation.
 28                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       4.7.1.2. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
       4.7.1.3. Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 6,000 lbs calculated main tank fuel.
   4.7.2. When an external tank indicator is inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked
   empty due to foam modification, comply with the following prior to flight:
       4.7.2.1. Check pressure with each pump in the external tank. If no pressure is obtained,
       the tank is verified empty.
       4.7.2.2. If pressure is obtained, ground transfer the fuel from the external tank. Defuel
       the external tank if unable to ground transfer.
       4.7.2.3. When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the
       tank on crossfeed until no pressure is obtained. Complete this prior to takeoff.
   4.7.3. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated guidelines
   in this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel tank with an
   inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except IAW paragraph 4.7.2.2 and the
   following:
       4.7.3.1. Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may be
       accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers, under
       these conditions require more than one crewmember to monitor and coordinate the
       transfer to maintain lateral wing balance.
       4.7.3.2. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available. This source
       can be either internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators, or in-flight refueling
       tanker fuel onload data.
       4.7.3.3. Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 lbs at all times. If small amounts
       (4,000 lbs or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 lbs into the tank with the
       inoperative indicator followed by an equal amount into the tank(s) with operative
       indicator(s). If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then transfer 1,000 lbs into the
       tank with the inoperative indicator, then up to 2,000 lbs as needed into the tank(s) with
       the operative indicators, then up to 1,000 lbs as needed into the tank with the inoperative
       indicator to bring all tanks symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 lbs as needed, repeating
       the cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks.
   4.7.4. Fuel may be transferred from main or external tanks with inoperative fuel quantity
   indicators only if the receiver requires emergency fuel. In this situation, the following
   procedures will apply:
       4.7.4.1. The fuel flow counter for the refueling pod being used must be operational to
       track the amount of fuel transferred.
       4.7.4.2. Transfer from only one tank at a time.
       4.7.4.3. Transfer no more than 1,000 lbs at a time between the tanks with the inoperative
       indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance.
4.8. Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop
landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight. EXCEPTION:
If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that further flight can be
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     29


accomplished, with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where
repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.
Required enroute stops are authorized.
4.9. Navigation Systems. Chapter 11 lists authorized airspace and procedures for the HC-
130J. Equipment listed in FLIP for compliance with appropriate airspace is mandatory. Loss of
any component before airspace entry requires return to a station with maintenance repair
capability or continued flight with degraded systems when acknowledged and approved by ATC
or filing via routes permitting operation with degraded equipment.
4.10. Soft Panel Operations.
   4.10.1. For partial or complete hard panel failures, aircrews may revert to soft panel
   operations. Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used
   for the remainder of the flight. Doing so will mitigate the hazards associated with restoring
   hard panel functionality for an item when the mission computer commanded-state is
   unknown.       Accomplishing the ENGINE SHUTDOWN and BEFORE LEAVING
   AIRPLANE checklists after the aircraft is parked will ensure the soft panel retains control of
   the particular item throughout shutdown. In all cases, PICs must consider the increased
   workload associated with using soft panels.
   4.10.2. Hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of communication
   with the mission computer (MC), an aircraft “reboot” may recover hard panel functionality.
   To determine if hard panel functionality can be regained, the following procedures must be
   followed in sequential order:
       4.10.2.1. Completely power down when accomplishing the BEFORE LEAVING
       AIRPLANE checklist.
       4.10.2.2. Complete all checklist items in the POWER UP checklist. Do not proceed past
       the POWER UP checklist until it can be determined if the hard panel has recovered.
       Depending on the system effected (such as auxiliary power unit (APU), bleed air, landing
       gear, etc.), do not apply bleed air or hydraulics until hard panel functionality can be
       determined.
       4.10.2.3. To determine if a hard panel has recovered, confirm hard panel and soft panel
       selections/settings are identical. Press the line select key (LSK) to turn the soft panel
       OFF. If a CNI “CHK HARD PNL” or a referenced hard panel fault advisory, caution,
       and warning system (ACAWS) message (i.e. “APU PNL FAULT”, “DEF SYS PNL
       FAULT”, etc.) does not appear, press the “VERIFY OFF” LSK. If feasible, check hard
       panel functionality.
       4.10.2.4. If a Communication/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU)
       “CHK HARD PNL” or a referenced hard panel fault ACAWS message appears, the hard
       panel has not recovered. The “CHK HARD PNL” message indicates there is a mismatch
       between the soft panel and hard panel commands to the MC independent of physical
       switch positions. Referenced hard panel fault messages are self-explanatory.
       4.10.2.5. If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the PIC’s discretion,
       the mission may continue to a station supporting a repair capability, including enroute
 30                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      stops. Do not reselect the hard panel. If a flight must continue under the control of two
      or more soft panels, a waiver is required.
   4.10.3. After returning to home station or repair facility with a hard panel malfunction,
   aircrew will shut down and turn the aircraft over to maintenance personnel.
4.11. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers.
   4.11.1. Installed - Number of components or systems installed.
      4.11.1.1. In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a conventional (hard)
      panel or from a Communication/Navigation/Identification Management Unit (CNI-MU)
      display (soft panel). Similarly, some indications can be viewed on either a hard panel or
      a soft panel. Since switch functions (or indications) may be duplicated on each of the
      three CNI-MU displays, the number of switches (or indications) installed may not always
      be clear. To clarify this condition, switches (or indications) are listed as ‘1’ in the
      installed column even when they are duplicated on a soft panel.
      4.11.1.2. Although the indications on each pilot’s Heads Down Displays (HDDs) can be
      repeated on more than one HDD, repetitions of data in excess of one per pilot are not
      relevant for flight and are not counted in this MEL. In general, the flight deck is
      designed to provide one set of data for each (in addition to the standby instruments).
      Thus, for most HDD indications, the “number installed” is listed as “2”, one for each
      pilot.
   4.11.2. Required - The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided
   the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met.
      4.11.2.1. Unless otherwise noted, when the item is a switch (or indication) which is
      duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the
      hard panel switch (or indication) or by the switch (indication) on one of the associated
      soft panels. For HDD indications, the number required is ‘2’ if both pilots must have an
      indication, ‘1’ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‘0’ if neither pilot is required
      to have the indication. For essential flight data (heading, airspeed, attitude and when
      required, navigation data), the pilot’s and copilot’s displays must have independent
      sources.
   4.11.3. Remarks and Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are contained
   in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight manual and
   other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.

                                            Chapter 5

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc. are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is a crewmember’s responsibility.
Checklist pages may be carried in separate binders provided checklist integrity is not
compromised.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. The only pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist binders are C-
   130 series T.O. aircrew checklists, ACC approved checklists, briefing guides and unit
   approved information guides IAW AFI 11-215. The inserts should be placed at the end of
   the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC.
   Units may construct locally approved in-flight guides using AF Form 4124, Flight Crew
   Information Guide.
5.2. Duty Station. One of the pilots may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet
physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, the PIC may authorize rest periods for one
pilot occupying a primary duty station in accordance with Controlled Cockpit Rest guidance in
AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules. All other crew positions are authorized rest
periods with approval from the PIC and IAW AFI 11-202V3. Only one pilot may be absent from
their duty station at a time. All aircrew members will notify the PIC prior to departing assigned
primary duty station.
   5.2.1. Combat System Operator (CSO) Station. The PIC may allow individuals to occupy
   the CSO station, when unoccupied, as long as their presence will not hinder the performance
   of the crew. Qualified crewmembers, or unqualified crewmembers under the supervision of
   an instructor, may perform tasks assigned by the PIC.
5.3. Flight Deck Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight deck
during non-critical phases of flight. Limit the number of persons on the flight deck to the
minimum required for mission accomplishment. At no time will this exceed seven (unless
otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to this AFI). Passengers and observers will not
be permitted access to either pilot position.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
   5.4.1. The PIC will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs/landings.
   5.4.2. Instructor/flight examiner pilots may takeoff/land from either seat under any
   condition.
   5.4.3. An Aircraft Commander (AC) qualified pilot may takeoff/land from either seat.
   Comply with paragraph 5.5.
   5.4.4. An AC qualified pilot will land from the left seat under the following conditions:
       5.4.4.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
 58                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       5.4.4.2. Maximum effort or substandard airfield operations. Instructor upgrade students
       may land from the right seat for training under direct Instructor Pilot (IP) supervision.
       5.4.4.3. Missions operating in areas of hostile activity. For units operating in defined
       combat zones, SQ/CC or equivalent may authorize AC qualified pilot or copilot landings
       from the right seat at specific airfields.
       5.4.4.4. Arrival and departure at airfields that require OG/CC or deployed equivalent
       approval as indicated in paragraph 5.20.5.1. Instructor/flight examiner pilots may
       perform or demonstrate takeoffs/landings from either seat into certification airfields
       specified in the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR.)
       5.4.4.5. PICs who possess less than 100 PAA hours in command since initial upgrade
       will make all takeoffs/landings in the left seat. EXCEPTION: AC or higher qualified
       pilots may perform takeoffs/landings from the right seat with a less than 100 hour AC in
       the left seat when required for currency.
       5.4.4.6. NVG Airland current and qualified ACs may accomplish NVG landings (non-
       short field/non-max effort) from the right seat provided the left seat pilot is an NVG
       Airland current and qualified AC or higher.
5.5. MPD Trained Landing Policy. Except as specified in paragraph 5.4, MPD pilots may
takeoff or land:
   5.5.1. From either seat if an instructor/flight examiner pilot occupies the other seat.
   5.5.2. From either seat if the PIC has accumulated at least 100 PAA hours in command since
   initial upgrade.
   5.5.3. From the right seat using NVGs for non-short field/non-maximum effort operations
   provided they are current and qualified and a current mission qualified AC occupies the left
   seat.
5.6. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The PF will command configuration changes.
The PM will verify appropriate airspeed and configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap
actuation command. The PM will operate the landing gear and the flaps.
5.7. Outside Observer/ACM Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during
taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 ft MSL as crew duties permit.
5.8. Seat Belts. Crewmembers occupying the P and CP positions will have seat belts fastened
from engine start through shutdown, except as outlined in paragraph 5.2 and the following:
   5.8.1. All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoffs, and
   landings. EXCEPTION: Evaluators, Instructors, Mission Commanders, crewmembers
   performing scanner duties, outside observers during taxi, LMs and medical personnel
   performing required duties; however, those individuals will have a designated seat (spot for
   combat loading procedures) and required restraint available.
   5.8.2. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat
   belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air
   turbulence.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  59


   5.8.3. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated unconventional forces and foreign
   counterparts during operations, exercises, and training. This procedure will not be used in
   lieu of providing normal seating when available. EXCEPTION: OG/CC (or deployed
   equivalent) may authorize floor loading other personnel on a case-by-case basis.
5.9. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations Movement on
the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   5.9.1. NVG Lighting. Lights-out operations during peacetime will be conducted IAW AFI
   11-202V3 and local procedures as required. During contingency operations IAW SPINS.
      5.9.1.1. Total lights out operations are authorized with concurrence of the controlling
      agency in restricted airspace and warning areas.
   5.9.2. Cargo compartment lighting will be dictated by the tactical situation and will be
   coordinated between the mission commander/PIC and LM(s). Cargo compartment
   emergencies may require overt lighting on full bright. The nature of the emergency and the
   tactical situation will dictate what level of lights is used, and whether the LM continues the
   use of NVGs. NOTE: If NVIS cannot be selected due to required HUD intensity levels or is
   not desired, thought should be given to pulling ECB 883, AFT CARGO DOME. This allows
   cargo compartment lighting to be NVIS mode while flight deck lighting remains in NORM.
   5.9.3. Strobe Lights. During contingency operations IAW SPINS.               For non-tactical
   operations, the aircraft strobe lights will be operated as follows:
      5.9.3.1. BEFORE STARTING ENGINES Checklist. Set the top strobe to RED.
      NOTE: When operating the APU, set the top strobe to RED.
      5.9.3.2. LINEUP Checklist. Set both strobes to WHT.
      5.9.3.3. AFTER LANDING Checklist. Set the top strobe to RED. The top strobe shall
      remain in RED until APU shutdown.
5.10. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.10.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA, or
   radio systems.
   5.10.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on ACC aircraft carrying hazard class
   1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). LMs will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops, handheld (HH) GPS, and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.10.3. EMI Certified laptop computers and software, such as PFPS or Falcon view are
   allowed in-flight IAW AFI 11-202V3, and their use is highly encouraged. These systems do
   not replace existing navigation equipment and must not be used as the sole means of
   navigation; each user must have a back-up chart immediately available in case use of the
   system is denied.
5.11. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
 60                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


5.12. Advisory/Required Calls. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation,
flight director and autopilot mode section, and mode transition, (e.g. “Autopilot engaged”,
“Altitude hold”, “Auto-throttles”, “Nav-Capture”, etc.) and/or when circumstances require
deviating from normal procedures.
   5.12.1. Takeoff Aborts and Landings. The PM will advise the PF which power levers to
   bring to reverse (“All 4”, “Inboards”, “Outboards”).
   5.12.2. Deviations. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of heading (+/- 10 degrees),
   airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 ft), and no attempt is being made to correct the
   deviation will immediately notify the PF.
   5.12.3. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately
   notify the PF.
   5.12.4. Advisory calls: Refer to Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 for a listing of mandatory
   advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions.

descend below 100 ft above touchdown zone elevation using the ALS as a reference unless the
red termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable.
Note 2. The PF will announce intentions to land or go-around.
Note 3. Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.13.
Note 4. For CAT II approaches crosscheck offside Radar Altimeter if not accomplished
previously on approach (i.e., 1000 AGL).
5.13. Stabilized Approach Philosophy. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to
numerous military and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe
operation of aircraft and are mandatory. This criterion defines specific parameters that mitigate
the risk during this critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate
corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
   5.13.1. The following criteria apply to all non-tactical approaches:
       5.13.1.1. At 1000 ft AGL (IMC):
 62                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


          5.13.1.1.1. Airspeed is -10/+20 knots of computed approach speed for aircraft
          configuration.
          5.13.1.1.2. Aircraft is in a landing configuration.
          5.13.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1500 FPM.
          5.13.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete.
          5.13.1.1.5. If these criteria are not met by 1000 ft AGL (IMC), the PM will announce
          the deviation.
       5.13.1.2. At 500 ft AGL (IMC/VMC):
          5.13.1.2.1. Airspeed is -10/+10 knots of computed approach speed for aircraft
          configuration.
          5.13.1.2.2. Aircraft is in a landing configuration.
          5.13.1.2.3. Sink rate is no greater 1000 FPM.
          5.13.1.2.4. All briefings and checklists are complete.
          5.13.1.2.5. If these criteria are not met by 500 ft AGL for all non-tactical approaches,
          the PM will announce "Unstable, go around." The PF will execute a missed
          approach.
   5.13.2. Tactical Approaches/VFR Patterns.           Stabilized approach criteria for tactical
   approaches/VFR patterns is recommended and desired. However, it is recognized that this
   criteria is not always valid due to the type of approach being conducted. In this situation, the
   PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution.
   5.13.3. For FTUs only. FTUs will fully emphasize and train so as to ensure the final product
   complies with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. However, the building block
   approach used to properly execute both tactical and non-tactical approach/landings for
   initial/upgrade training requires that instructors have the latitude to use their expertise and
   experience to deviate from stabilized approaches guidance. FTU instructors are expected to
   use good judgment, technique and latitude while developing student skills and therefore are
   relieved of strict compliance to the stabilized approach criterion during appropriate
   instructional scenarios.
5.14. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.14.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor VOX and interphone
   during all phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset or within listening distance are cleared prior
   to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.14.2. Radios:
       5.14.2.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    63


      5.14.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the primary ATC
      radio unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2
      frequencies on the inbound and outbound legs.
      5.14.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
      update the crew when the primary radio changes.
      5.14.2.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances.
      5.14.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible.
      5.14.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.14.3. Classified Communication Policies:
      5.14.3.1. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio
      transmissions.
      5.14.3.2. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit
      voice recorder (CVR) if it is operating. Ensure the CVR remains on and running for 30
      minutes until the tape is clear of any recorded classified conversations. If classified
      information is discussed while the EO/IR voice recorder is used in flight, the Removable
      Memory Module (RMM) tape must be turned into Intel to be classified upon landing. If
      en route, have the classified courier maintain the VHS tape until the tape has been
      properly classified.
      5.14.3.3. Non-aircrew members may monitor interphone or radio transmissions only
      when specifically approved by the AC. The AC will ensure the communications policy is
      briefed to these personnel prior to flight. The AC must ensure no one monitors classified
      information for which they are not cleared or transmits classified information over the
      radios.
      5.14.3.4. In order to prevent accidental recording of classified information on the Digital
      Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) or downloading it via the maintenance Data Transfer and
      Diagnostic System (DTADS), crews need to be fully aware of how the DFDR and
      DTADS work. DTADS is used routinely to download data from the DFDR for the C-
      130J AIRCAT program to assess structural life and other factors. DTADS is an
      unclassified system.        If the DFDR contains classified information such as
      latitude/longitude, it could be downloaded in this process. Maintainer's attach the
      DTADS system directly to the DFDR export connect to accomplish the download. This
      process only copies the data, the original content remains on the DFDR until written over.
      In order to ensure classified information is not recorded to the DFDR; crews should use
      the 'record inhibit' functionality in the CNI-MS during classified missions and inhibit data
      which is determined to be classified.
5.15. Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   5.15.1. “Time Out” is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of “Time Out” will:
      5.15.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
 64                                 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       5.15.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
       5.15.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
       established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
       with the developing conditions.
   5.15.2. As soon as possible after a “Time Out” has been called, the aircrew will take the
   following actions:
       5.15.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
       5.15.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
       5.15.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
       inputs relative to the stated concerns.
       5.15.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
       current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.15.3. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to essential for crew coordination and mission
   accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 3,000 ft AGL.
   5.15.4. Fuel Panel. The fuel panel is considered a “verification panel.” The PM/LM/CSO
   should advise the PF before operating the panel (i.e., priming, cross-feeding, tank-to-engine,
   transferring, non-standard configurations, and dumping). After completing the task, a second
   crewmember should verify the panel is set correctly. To facilitate this coordination, pilots
   should plan to make changes to the fuel panel during periods of low workload such as before
   taxi and during cruise segments.
   5.15.5. Critical Action Coordination.
       5.15.5.1. Flight critical/irreversible actions should always be confirmed by two crew
       members. These actions include, but are not limited to, pulling the engine fire handle,
       placing the engine start switch to stop, moving a propeller control switch to feather,
       discharging agent, and dumping fuel. The crewmember performing the action points to
       the affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member
       (i.e. “CONFIRM NUMBER ONE”). The crew member confirming the action looks at
       the affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e. “NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”).
       5.15.5.2. Once the fire handle is pulled, the ACAWS messages indicating the shutdown
       condition/situation may disappear. Verifying and verbally confirming associated
       ACAWS messages prior to engine shutdown will assist the aircrew in determining if the
       engine can be restarted if a greater emergency arises.
5.16. Automation. The purpose of the automation is to assist the flight crew with mission
accomplishment. Aircraft automation will not command crew actions. The automated systems
will recommend/perform actions and the crew will determine/verify the proper course of action.
   5.16.1. Crewmembers will understand the operation and limitations of automation and be
   proficient at operating the aircraft in all levels of automation. The level of automation used
   at any specific time should be the most appropriate to reduce crew workload, increase
   situational awareness, and enhance mission effectiveness and safety. The PF will determine
   the most desirable level of automation for a given situation. The PIC has the ultimate
   responsibility and authority for the safety of the aircraft, passengers, and crew and will
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  65


  manage workload, set priorities and employ the available resources accordingly. As flight
  situations change, do not feel locked into a level of automation.
  5.16.2. If the AFCS/Flight Director provides unexpected commands to the flight controls,
  the PF will revert to lower levels of automation or manual flight as necessary before
  attempting to resolve system problems.
  5.16.3. Crews will follow the guidance below, except for cruise flight (above 3,000 ft AGL):
     5.16.3.1. The PF will fly the aircraft and maintain a dedicated head-up lookout. If the PF
     intends to be head-down, aircraft control shall be transferred to the PM, who will remain
     head-up. Head-down time does not include momentary scanning of the CNI-MU, HDDs,
     and panels.
     5.16.3.2. Any crewmember that observes both pilots head-down at the same time shall
     alert the PF without delay.
     5.16.3.3. If the PM must divert attention away from normal clearing and monitoring
     duties for an extended period of time, the PM will state “head-down.” The PF will
     verbally acknowledge this call. The PM will verbalize “head-up” after completion of
     duties. The PF will then update the PM on current status as required.
  5.16.4. The importance of entering the proper data into the system is elevated with
  automated flight. Historical data has indicated a significant decrease in the level of safe
  operations due to pilots becoming complacent and overly reliant on automated systems.
     5.16.4.1. A closed loop system of entering data and verifying the correct data is entered
     before allowing the aircraft automation to perform a function is critically important.
     Regardless of who initiates the action, the other pilot must verify the data and both pilots
     will monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response.
     5.16.4.1.1. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of
     communication designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors
     between the PF and PM. VVM consists of the following three step process:
         5.16.4.1.2. Prior to making any changes to the selected automated system, or
         performing any T.O. defined irreversible/critical action, the pilot performing the
         action will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
         5.16.4.1.3. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution, and
         ensure the correct change or action was made.
         5.16.4.1.4. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected
         performance is achieved.
         5.16.4.1.5. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director
         and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible.
         The PM will acknowledge the call. Use appropriate levels of automation as required
         by the flight conditions.
     5.16.4.2. Table 5 5 and Table 5.6 provide standard actions for both pilots during
     Automated and Manual flight.

        5.16.4.3. Automated Flight is defined as the autopilot fully engaged and coupled to the
        Flight Director. Use autothrottles as desired. CAUTION: If the autothrottles are
        disengaged for sustained descents during automatic flight, it is possible that Altitude
        Capture may occur with the power levers at or near Flight Idle and result in an approach
        to stall condition.
        5.16.4.4. Manual Flight is defined as the PF providing manual input to the flight controls
        or autopilot. Use autothrottles as desired.

5.17. Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS) / Terrain Awareness and Warning
System (TAWS).
   5.17.1. When a GCAS TERRAIN or TAWS TERRAIN / OBSTACLE AHEAD alert occurs
   and terrain/obstacle clearance cannot be assured visually, immediately change the flight path
   (within 3 to 5 seconds) by initiating a takeoff power climb. Continue the climb until a safe
   altitude is reached or until exiting the alert envelope. With terrain and obstacles clearly in
   sight, the PF will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions and visually remain clear of
   terrain/obstacles. If the situation degrades and a GCAS PULL UP or TAWS TERRAIN /
   OBSTACLE PULL UP alert occurs, immediately execute the GCAS/TAWS alert recovery
   IAW the flight manual. WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude
   warning.
   5.17.2. In TACTICAL mode, several GCAS alert envelopes are modified to allow for
   maneuvering in close proximity to terrain. Normally, this mode is most suitable for modified
   contour flight and VFR low-altitude arrivals but, at the PIC‘s discretion, may be used for any
   tactical operation.
5.18. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
   5.18.1. Mission requirements and certain emergencies may allow selection of “TA only”
   since the proximity to aircraft may result in unwarranted RAs. Excessive climb and descent
   rates could lead to inadvertent TCAS advisories. Reducing climb/descent rates near level off
   can limit inadvertent TCAS advisories.

       5.19.1.2. Non-Precision Approaches. Setting the RAD ALT as prescribed below is
       meant to adequately alert the crew to an unsafe terrain clearance condition ("Altitude-
       Altitude") in the absence of a "Minimums-Minimums" alert. Setting the RAD ALT to a
       higher setting than prescribed may result in premature/unexpected "Altitude-Altitude"
       advisories and prevent the GCAS "Minimums" alert.
          5.19.1.2.1. Straight-In Approaches. Normally set RAD ALT reference to 250 ft
          (minimum setting).
          5.19.1.2.2. Circling Approaches.      Normally set RAD ALT reference to 300 ft
          (minimum setting).
       5.19.1.3. When established on a published approach in IMC, or at night when terrain
       clearance cannot be assured, and an "Altitude-Altitude" special alert is heard, initiate an
 68                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      immediate go-around. Once terrain clearance is confirmed, resume normal operations.
      In day VMC, the aircrew will evaluate the alert and determine the appropriate course of
      action (continue the approach or go-around).
   5.19.2. Tactical Operations. Reference Chapter 16, paragraph 16.20 for further guidance.
5.20. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements.
   5.20.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. For peace-time do not use runways
   less than 3,000 ft. Minimum runway width is 80 ft (60 ft for max effort procedures).
   Minimum taxiway width is 30 ft. The MAJCOM/A3 may waive runway/taxiway width
   requirements. NOTE: Use of non-hard surfaced runways or taxiways require OG/CC
   approval (or deployed equivalent.) Use Table 5.7 when applicable.
   5.20.2. Use of Wheel Brakes. If greater than a flight manual defined “partially braked
   landing” is used, the PIC will comply with all zone requirements and minimum brake cooling
   times IAW the performance manual LANDING BRAKE ENERGY chart. This will ensure
   adequate braking capability is available for any subsequent takeoff and abort.
   5.20.3. Normal Operations.
      5.20.3.1. The minimum runway required for a normal takeoff is the charted CFL.
      5.20.3.2. Normal takeoffs shall not be made when Refusal Speed is less than Ground
      Minimum Control Speed (Vmcg). In this condition the PIC will either:
          5.20.3.2.1. Download cargo or fuel.
          5.20.3.2.2. Wait until weather conditions improve.
          5.20.3.2.3. Utilize maximum effort procedures, see paragraph 5.20.7
      5.20.3.3. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs will
      be initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.
      Intersection takeoffs may be made at the discretion of the PIC provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows for a
      safe takeoff and departure. CNI TOLD will be updated to reflect actual runway
      remaining.
      5.20.3.4. The minimum runway required for normal landings is the charted landing
      distance over 50 ft obstacle with outboard engines in high speed ground idle and inboard
      engines in max reverse.
      5.20.3.5. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available, stressed, and
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
      if needed.
      5.20.3.6. Acceleration Check Time. An acceleration time check is required when refusal
      speed is less than rotation speed. An Acceleration Time Check should also be computed
      when, in the opinion of the PIC, a critical condition exists (heavy GW, high PA,
      obstacles, RSC, etc.).
   5.20.4. Arresting Cables.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 69


     5.20.4.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
     recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
     to have the cable inspected.
     5.20.4.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
     slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, ATIS, or ATC.
     5.20.4.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems are installed,
     with an eight point cable tie-down system, without regard to the flight manual caution.
     When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown
     if the BAK-12 system includes eight point tie-downs, aircrews should recognize the
     increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
  5.20.5. Other Airfield Requirements.
     5.20.5.1. Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Requirements (ARFF). ARFF requirements at
     non-USAF active flying bases are as follows:
         5.20.5.1.1. Up to four takeoffs and landings within 14 consecutive days may be
         accomplished at an airfield or LZ without ARFF. Each Group/Wing should track
         landing totals at airfields under their control. If landing totals are not tracked at
         airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Group/Wing current ops will track
         landings to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.
         5.20.5.1.2. For more frequent operations at an airfield or LZ, refer to AFPAM 32-
         2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Exercises and Contingency Response Operations,
         and AFI 13-217 to calculate ARFF requirements.          NOTE: Non-USAF ARFF
         vehicles may be used if the agent and pumping capabilities are equivalent.
         5.20.5.1.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case
         basis. Required information for waiver requests can be found in AFPAM 32-2004.
     5.20.5.2. A current landing zone (LZ) survey (within the past five years as specified in
     AFI 13-217) is needed before using other than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways.
  5.20.6. RCR and RSC Limitations.
     5.20.6.1. When other than RCR or RSC is used to report the runway conditions, the PIC
     will refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) for standard ICAO conversions
     based on general runway conditions; be conservative when dealing with unknown
     conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways). Normally, RCR
     values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the
     taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The
     runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective
     glare.
     5.20.6.2. The performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete
     runways. Use the RCR values given in Table 5.7 when landing on other than concrete
     surfaces. The RCR values in Table 5.7 are estimates based on operational experience and
     should be used only as a guide.
 70                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


Table 5.7. RCR Values.
TYPE SURFACE                          RCR (DRY)         RCR (WET)
Asphalt                                   23                12
Aluminum Matting                          20                10
M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP)                 20                 8
M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP)              13                 3
Clay/Crushed Rock/Coral                   16                 5
      5.20.6.3. Limit HC-130J operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a
      covering of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is
      equal to one inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than one inch of slush
      or water is present may not be accurate.
      5.20.6.4. On runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff computations will be
      based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of
      40 ft either side of centerline should be cleared (30 ft for maximum effort procedures). If
      40 ft either side of centerline is not cleared (30 ft for max effort procedures),
      computations will be based on the non-cleared portion.
   5.20.7. Maximum Effort Operations.
      5.20.7.1. Use Maximum Effort procedures when conditions (runway dimensions and/or
      obstacles) or directives require their use. Runway widths less than 80 ft require a
      maximum effort qualified crew. All maximum effort operations must fall in the
      "Recommended" area of the wind limitations charts unless otherwise approved by the
      OG/CC. For peace-time, do not use runways less than 3,000 ft long unless waived by the
      OG/CC or designated representative.
      5.20.7.2. Maximum Effort Takeoff. Use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available
      runway length is less than CFL.
         5.20.7.2.1. Minimum runway length is the charted ADJUSTED MFLMETO.
         EXCEPTION: SQ/CC may approve the use of MFLMETO not corrected for VMCA
         or VMU3 if mission necessity dictates.
         5.20.7.2.2. Minimum rotation speed is Adjusted Maximum Effort Rotation Speed
         (VRamax). EXCEPTION: SQ/CC may approve the use of VRmax if mission
         necessity dictates.
         5.20.7.2.3. Acceleration Check Time. An acceleration check time is required when
         refusal speed is less than rotation speed.
      5.20.7.3. Maximum Effort Landing. Use maximum effort landing procedures whenever
      the runway available for landing is less than that required for a normal landing. Plan the
      touchdown within the first 500 ft of usable runway.
         5.20.7.3.1. The minimum runway required for a maximum effort landing is equal to
         the charted Maximum Effort landing ground roll plus 500 ft. If the zone is unmarked,
         minimum runway length is ground roll plus 1,000 ft. OG/CC (or deployed
         equivalent) may approve ground roll plus 500 ft to an unmarked zone. WARNING:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 71


          A go-around point will be identified to all crewmembers for all AMP-4 operations
          prior to execution.
          5.20.7.3.2. Compute landing performance using: two outboard engines in ground
          idle, two inboard engines in reverse, (“2OB HGI; 2IB REV” in the Performance
          Manual), and maximum anti-skid braking. OG/CC (or deployed equivalent) may
          approve the use of all four in reverse performance data.
      5.20.7.4. Training.
          5.20.7.4.1. Minimum runway length is 3,000 ft or IAW paragraph 5.20.7.2.1 and
          5.20.7.3.1.
          5.20.7.4.2. Takeoff speed will be Adjusted Max Effort Rotation Speed (AMAX).
          Squadron commanders may approve the use of actual max effort speeds (takeoff and
          obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis.
          5.20.7.4.3. Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 ft.
5.21. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.21.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 ft of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring
   the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions
   by at least 10 ft. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on
   the Ground, aircraft may taxi into or out of a marked parking spot without marshallers/wing
   walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a
   minimum of 10 ft clearance from any permanent obstruction. Adjacent aircraft are
   considered a permanent obstruction provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated
   spot and not moving. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a
   permanent obstruction provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be
   designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another
   suitable means.
   5.21.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, the PIC will deplane crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act as an
   observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshallers
   and wing walkers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Observers should be in a
   position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate with
   the pilot.
   5.21.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.21.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be familiar with taxi
      routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.21.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
   5.21.4. Reverse Taxi. The PIC shall coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the
   LM and marshaller (when available). Before reverse taxiing, the LM shall:
 72                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      5.21.4.1. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
      5.21.4.2. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12-inches above
      horizontal.
      5.21.4.3. Position himself/herself on the aircraft ramp to direct reverse taxi, report any
      hazards, and provide the PIC with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance
      remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
      5.21.4.4. Stop no less than 25 ft from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
      5.21.4.5. During night reverse taxi operations without NVGs, the PIC and LM will
      ensure the taxi area is sufficiently lighted.
   5.21.5. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the PIC, the LM may
   open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to horizontal to prepare for cargo offload/onload
   provided equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secure in the cargo compartment. Careful
   attention must be given to the ramp position when taxiing on rough or unprepared surfaces.
5.22. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.22.1. PICs should elect to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight dictates an
   immediate jettison (as determined by the PIC). Except in the case of an emergency, before
   jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude,
   and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas, except when safety of
   flight would be compromised.
   5.22.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate
   recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.22.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.22.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettison. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 ft AGL, off published
   airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Avoid circling
   descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to
   the base environmental coordinator.
5.23. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action.
   5.23.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.23.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.23.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    73


       5.23.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent.
   5.23.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
   landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
   Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR
   Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance
   instructions.
   5.23.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, the PIC has the
   authority to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the
   appropriate C2 authority.
   5.23.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the enroute portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized CONUS bird
   migration patterns, PFPS software overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory
   System (AHAS) website is another source for real time bird hazard information. See
   AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for
   additional information.
   5.23.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practical, to inspect the aircraft for damage.
5.24. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities.

                                 AIRCREW PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Pre-Mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms.
   6.1.1. Wear the aircrew uniform as outlined in AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment
   (AFE) Program, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement, on all missions, unless other
   attire is authorized. When the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires civilian attire, wear
   conservatively styled clothing.
   6.1.2. All crewmembers will have Nomex gloves in their possession. It is recommended that
   primary crewmembers wear Nomex gloves during engine start, takeoff, landing, and when
   operating in a combat environment. LMs and anyone assisting will wear gloves for all
   airdrops, cargo loading/unloading, winching, and pyrotechnic operations.
   6.1.3. Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
   6.1.4. Personnel will have the appropriate items of clothing in their possession when flying
   in Arctic and Antarctic regions. EXCEPTION: Not applicable to transoceanic flights or
   when staging or transiting Elmendorf AFB, AK.
6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment.
   6.2.1. Passports. Carry passports on missions when the FCG requires them.
   6.2.2. Shot Records. Carry shot records on all off-station missions outside the CONUS,
   Alaska, or Hawaii. Aircrew members must meet immunization requirements for the mission.
   6.2.3. Identification Tags. Identification tags will be worn around the neck or carried in a
   flight suit pocket.
   6.2.4. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins,
   clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in the aircraft or on the flightline. EXCEPTION:
   Female crew members may wear plain elastic hair fasteners or plastic barrettes, providing
   they do not interfere with the wearing of headsets, helmets, or the donning of oxygen
   equipment. Account for all devices before and after flight.
   6.2.5. Flight Kits. Carry a headset, helmet, oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all
   flights.
   6.2.6. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual
   combat missions.) Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
      6.2.6.1. Attach badges to the uniform by a lanyard or display it on an arm band or double
      breakaway lanyard around the neck. Do not display badges from before starting engines
      until after engine shut-down.
   6.2.7. Reflective Belts. Wear a reflective belt or suitable substitute IAW local directives.
      6.2.7.1. Deployed commanders will direct reflective belt use in a combat zone, but crews
      will normally wear them during night operations.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    75


   6.2.8. Tool and Airdrop Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. Individual units will
   establish requirements for tool kit contents. One LM airdrop kit will be on board for aerial
   delivery missions.
       6.2.8.1. For PDM inputs, carry a tool kit containing as a minimum: multi-tool (screw
       driver, pliers, wire cutter), safety wire, fuse pullers, and a 3/8” wrench.
   6.2.9. Hostile Environment Repair Procedures (HERP) Kit. For future reference.
   6.2.10. Night-Vision Operations. Each crewmember will preflight their own NVGs before
   flight and carry a spare set of batteries. The PIC must designate a crewmember to preflight
   and carry a spare set of NVGs onboard the aircraft. Each crewmember will also carry an
   NVG-compatible light source.
   6.2.11. Survival and Protective Equipment. Personnel will wear survival and protective
   equipment provided during hostile environment operations. Unit/deployed commanders may
   amend survival and protective equipment requirements based on the threat. See AFTTP 3-
   3.HC-130 for a list of survival and protective equipment.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
   information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum, should
   include the items in AFI 11-202V3, AFTTP 3-3.HC-130, and the following:
       6.3.1.1. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
       6.3.1.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Airfield Risk Assessment (ARA), Country
       Risk Assessment (CRA), and FLIP.
       6.3.1.3. Review the FCG for the areas of operation (to include classified portions).
       Obtain necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
       6.3.1.4. Obtain required customs forms.
       6.3.1.5. Obtain appropriate FLIP and sufficient communications security (COMSEC)
       materials for the duration of the mission.
       6.3.1.6. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight
       evaluations will remain current for crewmembers throughout TDY or deployment period.
       6.3.1.7. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
       6.3.1.8. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
       appropriate.
6.4. Airfield Review. Accomplish airfield review IAW AFI 11-202V3.
6.5. Intelligence Briefing. Before departing on missions outside the United States, aircrews
will receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political
and military development in the planned operating area. In theater, aircrews should receive
intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL), or enroute stop, and
thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelligence
value to the local intelligence office as soon as practical to ensure timely dissemination of
mission reports (MISREPs).
 76                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


6.6. Aircrew Publications Requirements. PICs will ensure the publications specified in Table
6.1 are current and available on the aircraft for all missions. Units may specify additional
publications in their local unit supplement. The use of electronic flight manuals in flight will be
for reference purposes only (paper copies are always required) unless MAJCOM approved
electronic flight bags are approved for use. Primary crewmembers will carry their respective
crew position aircrew guide on all missions.

6.7. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.7.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is on board, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security IAW Chapter
   7. At bases not under jurisdiction of the AF, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected.
   AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Managmenet, provides specific guidance
   concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment on board the aircraft. For
   classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock and seal the
   aircraft. If available, use RAVENS to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by
   the host country for flightline/airport area control.
   6.7.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained. The on-site C2 center will provide temporary storage for
   COMSEC and other classified materials during enroute, turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a
   storage facility is not available, the aircraft safe is GSA approved, and may be used for
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    77


   material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC will only be
   transferred to authorized DoD personnel. NOTE: Narcotics, currency, and weapons are not
   allowed to be stored along with COMSEC in the same aircraft safe at any time.
   6.7.3. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the Mode
   IV on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Carry authenticators when
   flying into an ADIZ, participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when
   specified in operation plans. Before departing for any destination without COMSEC storage
   facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC managers for guidance.
       6.7.3.1. The COMSEC material required depends on the theater of operation and user.
       The base COMSEC custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in
       obtaining the material required for the mission.
   6.7.4. Remove classified information stored in any electronic devices or aircraft systems
   (such as secure voice/DAMA, IFF, and mission information.)
   6.7.5. In the event of an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment
   prior to crash landing or bailout, if possible.
6.8. Narcotics. Maintain narcotics in the pararescue medical kits IAW appropriate directives.
6.9. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Crewmembers will review the FCIF before all
missions or ground aircrew duties and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item
number, date, and crewmember’s initials. If an electronic sign-in system is used (i.e., PEX), then
FCIF currency will be verified appropriately utilizing that system.
   6.9.1. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF or joining a mission enroute will receive an FCIF
   update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission. Instructor pilots
   flying with general officers will brief appropriate FCIF items to them.
   6.9.1. (AETC) Units will establish procedures for updating aircrew off-station. At a
   minimum, crews will be notified of any safety related issues.
   6.9.2. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign in system is not operational at alert time.
6.10. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors. PICs will
accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.10.1. OG/CCs will develop ORM guidelines to identify and mitigate acceptable levels of
   risk for all missions.
6.11. Aircraft Mission Kits. Units will maintain one mission kit per aircraft. EXCEPTION:
FTUs will establish the number and content of the mission kits for their assigned aircraft.
   6.11.1. Prior to off-station departures, the PIC will confirm a current mission kit is on board
   the aircraft. The kit will contain, but is not limited to the items listed in Table 6.2. Items
   required by a unit or wing directive to be carried by an individual crewmember need not be
   duplicated in the mission kit. Maintain sufficient quantities of directives and planning
   documents to allow implementation of evacuation and contingency plans.

* Two required when a CSO is not part of the crew.
NOTE: Units may modify the kit to carry only FLIP documents for the theater of operations.
6.13. Briefing Requirements.
   6.13.1. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide mission essential
   information. Refer to the appropriate briefing guides for content.
   6.13.2. Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission.
   EXCEPTION: When pre-mission requirements dictate, the PIC may excuse certain
   crewmembers from the briefing. The PIC will conduct a face-to-face briefing with those
   personnel prior to engine start.
6.14. Call Signs. Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives for
all missions except local area training missions. Use squadron or wing static call signs, as
directed, for local area training missions.
   6.14.1. Aeromedical Evacuation. Preface normal call sign with “EVAC” plus the last five
   digits of the aircraft tail number when patients are on board.
   6.14.2. Search and Rescue (SAR). When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the
   call sign “AIR FORCE RESCUE” plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.15. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation. This does not preclude VFR training to
maintain proficiency in mission essential VFR operations.
6.16. Sensitive Mission Operations.
   6.16.1. Certain missions require special flight planning procedures or deceptive measures.
   Mission operating directives, MAJCOM/CC operations orders, or other tasking orders will
   direct use of these procedures. Crewmembers will be briefed on modification to normal
   procedures prior to execution of the operation. For these types of missions, the
   MAJCOM/CC or COMAFFOR will approve missions requiring coordination with non-ACC
   agencies prior to execution.
   6.16.2. The planning agency tasked with the mission will provide the aircrew with the
   following information:
       6.16.2.1. Departure procedures.
 80                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.16.2.2. Enroute procedures to include tracks, ALTRVs, MARSA, tanker rendezvous,
       and emergency divert procedures.
       6.16.2.3. Arrival procedures.
       6.16.2.4. All communications requirements.
6.17. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.17.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including enroute wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or
   furnished by another agency, the PIC and CSO will verify routes and flight altitudes for
   proper terrain clearance.
       6.17.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.17.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
   6.17.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
       6.17.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.17.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan.
       6.17.2.3. Ground based NAVAIDs.
   6.17.3. When conducting DZ/LZ operations, both pilots will verify CNI-MU CARP/LZ
   information with a valid DZ/LZ survey. Refer to AFI 13-217 for DZ/LZ survey information,
   requirements, and applicability.
6.18. Departure Planning. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, this chapter, and
the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. The PIC must determine the
obstacle height, distance, and gradient information necessary for performance computations. To
verify CNI TOLD, both pilots will cross-check CNI TOLD INIT entries.
   6.18.1. VFR Departures. VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance
   planning.
       6.18.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
       VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
       high terrain are avoided.
       6.18.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                      81


        6.18.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability must provide obstacle avoidance along
        departure route.
     6.18.1.2.2. Weather Minimums For Takeoff and Departure Alternate Procedures. Use
     Table 6.4 and AFI 11-202V3.
 82                                 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013

                                  representative, if mission is
and RVR is less than 1600 but                                      4)
                                  HHQ directed
equal to or greater than 1000
NOTES:
1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the available
approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use CAT II ILS minimums to determine if a
departure alternate is required.

2. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:

  a. Alternate must be located within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be equal
to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after
takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400).

-OR-

 b. Alternate must be located within 2 hours flying time, the existing weather must be at least
500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but no lower than 600-2 for a
precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for ETA at
the alternate +/- 1 hour.

3. Aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
(MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria.

4. Departure runway must have operational centerline lighting and dual RVR readouts and
displays for both the approach and departure end of runway (RVR must be at or greater than
1000 at both the approach end and departure end and runway). For runways with triple RVR
readouts, the pilot may use any two consecutive read-outs to determine if the runway is usable
for departure (aircraft performance permitting). For example: Approach end RVR=800, midfield
RVR=1200, departure end RVR=1000. If aircraft performance and runway length will permit
taking off at midfield, this runway is usable for takeoff.
6.19. Arrival Planning. The forecast destination weather will be according to AFI 11-202V3
and the following:
   6.19.1. File two alternates when:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     83


      6.19.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
      available DoD or FAA AeroNav Products (AJV-3) precision approach.
      6.19.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
      published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
      (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
      taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest 100 ft (or as
      determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach with
      a published HAA of 642 ft would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 ft.
      6.19.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
      for RCR.
   6.19.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not exceed 3-
   hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.19.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
   geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
   The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
      6.19.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
      and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and.
      6.19.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums, but not below precision approach minimums (for ETA
      plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 12 for fuel planning considerations to a remote or
      island destination.
   6.19.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes
   greater than 59°N, see Chapter 12 for fuel planning considerations.
6.20. Adverse Weather. All missions should be planned to avoid areas of severe weather,
including icing or severe turbulence.
   6.20.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.20.1.1. Anytime windshear may be encountered on departure or approach, it is
      recommended that aircrews select weather mode on one NAV RADAR display and
      windshear mode on another NAV RADAR display.
      6.20.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
   6.20.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence is prohibited.
   6.20.3. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
      6.20.3.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle.
84                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


     6.20.3.2. Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
     Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain
     is equivalent to severe icing. Temperatures near 0°C, may cause ice or frost to
     accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will
     confirm with weather agencies what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing
     fog. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
         6.20.3.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
         flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
         associated flight manual with respect to de-ice/anti-ice procedures and holdover
         times.
         6.20.3.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
         icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved
         anti-icing fluids, aircrews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-
         1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located on the CoP:
         https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OT-
         SA-03. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC
         shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are
         exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
         6.20.3.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
  6.20.4. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 ft) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2,000 ft vertically, avoid
  them by at least:
     6.20.4.1. 20 NMs at or above FL 230.
     6.20.4.2. 10 NMs below FL 230.
     6.20.4.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations. CAUTION: Aircraft damage is
     possible 20 NMs or more from any thunderstorm. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for
     Aircrews, for more information.
  6.20.5. Avoid prolonged flight in areas of high lightening potential, i.e., clouds within +/-
  5,000 ft of the freezing level or +/- 8°C of the freezing level, and in any intensity of
  precipitation or turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity.
  6.20.6. Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a ground-
  based radar. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should
  only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It
  should never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on
  ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide
  avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
     6.20.6.1. Changing routing.
     6.20.6.2. Diverting to alternate.
     6.20.6.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                       85


    6.20.7. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
    departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.20.7.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
       6.20.7.2. Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
    6.20.8. Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are in the
    vicinity of the airport providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as
    hail, lightning, strong winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport,
    and are not forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to
    include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
    6.20.9. When performing approaches and landing at locations where temperature are 0°C or
    below, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction
    Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
    6.20.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported volcanic
    activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least 20 NMs.

Section 6C—Pre-flight

6.21. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
    6.21.1. Review the AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or
    operating aircraft systems. An exceptional release (ER) must be signed before flight. A
    maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the
    ER. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER. When a release is
    signed by the PIC, it is effective only for those flights in which the releasing PIC participates
    as an aircrew member. Confirm that the DD1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are on
    board the aircraft.
    6.21.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
    that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
    another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
    Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. The
    chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the AFMC repair team
    must first authorize the release. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact HQ
    ACC/A3, via Stan/Eval channels, for flight authorization. The PICs concurrence is required
    before the aircraft can be flown.
    6.21.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
    instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
    symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
    Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
    reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. pre-flight, thru-flight, basic post-
    flight) is overdue.
    6.21.4. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
    Chapter 13.

6.22. Dash One Pre-Flight.
   6.22.1. Aircrew Dash One Pre-flight Inspection Requirements. Except to prepare for OREs,
   ORIs, and contingencies/evacuations, units should avoid using unscheduled crewmembers to
   accomplish multiple pre-flights. In the case where an aircrew is flying an aircraft they did
   not preflight, they must receive a briefing from the preflight crew on the condition of that
   aircraft.
   6.22.2. The aircrew dash one preflight inspection is required prior to the first flight of the
   flying period and will remain valid until either:
       6.22.2.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours provided the aircraft is sealed,
       not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
       6.22.2.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
       6.22.2.3. When an aircrew assumes a pre-flighted spare or quick-turn, perform a
       thorough visual inspection, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance
       or servicing.
   6.22.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue. See AFI 13-217 and MAJCOM specific guidance
   for specific Fire Fighting and Rescue requirements.
       6.22.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
       for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire extinguisher
       for added fire protection.
       6.22.3.2. A fire guard is required for all engine starts except normal APU starts. A
       crewmember or ground controller may act as fire guard.
6.23. Alert Aircraft. When an aircraft is mobilizing for deployment, units are authorized to
place it on alert status. It must be prepared IAW established T.O.s, accepted by an aircrew,
remain under the control of operations, and be monitored by maintenance. When sealing an
aircraft, accomplish pre-flight inspections IAW paragraph 6.22. Maintain aircraft on alert
status as follows: NOTE: Placing a unit on alert does not in itself place the unit’s aircraft on
alert status.
   6.23.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
   6.23.2. When operationally feasible, have an aircrew other than the alert aircrew preflight
   the alert aircraft. If this is not feasible, follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.4.
   6.23.3. Aircraft preflight times should align with the start of the alert period eliminating the
   need to update the preflight during the alert period.
   6.23.4. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided
   the following conditions are met:
       6.23.4.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission
       requirements.
       6.23.4.2. Communication is maintained with the primary controlling agency.
       6.23.4.3. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
       area.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  87


     6.23.4.4. Maintenance Thru-Flight Inspection.      A thru-flight inspection will be
     accomplished IAW T.O. 00-20-1 after each flight when a turnaround sortie, continuation
     flight, or continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection is not
     required.
         6.23.4.4.1. Alpha-1. No maintenance actions required. The aircrew may seal the
         aircraft for alert once the aircraft servicing is complete. A new preflight is not
         required until the end of the preflight validity period.
         6.23.4.4.2. Alpha-2. Maintenance action required. If the preflight validity period has
         time remaining, the aircrew may seal the aircraft after a thorough inspection of
         maintenance actions.
         6.23.4.4.3. Alpha-3. Prolonged maintenance required. If major maintenance is
         accomplished, accomplish preflight inspections IAW paragraph 6.22. If minor
         maintenance is accomplished and the preflight validity period has time remaining, the
         aircrew may seal the aircraft after a thorough inspection of maintenance actions.
  6.23.5. A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, will be prepared for the
  alert aircraft. Alert crews are authorized to load TOLD using the worst weather conditions
  expected for the alert period. Use the TOLD for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown
  for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions.
  6.23.6. Consider alert aircraft off-limits to all personnel except alert crewmembers. No
  maintenance may be performed on the aircraft without approval of the unit/mission
  commander. NOTE: With PIC agreement, and when cargo load warrants (i.e. T.O. 1C-
  130(H)J-9 section VI cargo), alert LMs before the rest of the crew. Base the aircrew
  FDP/CDP on the LMs show time.
  6.23.7. When a pre-flighted alert aircraft changes, or an alert crew change occurs and the
  same aircraft remains on alert, the oncoming crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the
  aircraft and check applicable items listed below:
     6.23.7.1. AFTO Forms 781 series.
     6.23.7.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
     6.23.7.3. Fuel quantity.
     6.23.7.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
     6.23.7.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
     6.23.7.6. Liquid oxygen quantity.
     6.23.7.7. Battery Voltages
     6.23.7.8. Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges.
     6.23.7.9. Publications.
  6.23.7.10. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the LM will make an entry in the AFTO
  Form 781A stating, at a minimum, the date and time the crew completed the pre-flight.
 88                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


6.24. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.24.1. The PIC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire mission
   are aboard the aircraft and all personnel are briefed or trained in their use before departing
   home station or enroute stations. NOTE: Local training missions only require a preflight
   inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
   6.24.2. Before departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review, sign, and
   date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, and verify all required
   equipment is on board and required inspections have been completed. In addition, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, and verify all required Dash 21
   equipment has been certified as installed and initial check signed by maintenance and
   configuration documents match mission requirements.
      6.24.2.1. Mission Equipment. Aircrew members discovering missing equipment will
      accomplish the following:
          6.24.2.1.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing.
          Additionally, ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an enroute station is
          documented in the AFTO Form 781A.
          6.24.2.1.2. Annotate in the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant
          column indicating the quantity remaining for the item.
          6.24.2.1.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
          recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
      6.24.2.2. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the pre-flight
      than is annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in
      the next vacant column for the item.
   6.24.3. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be required
   (minimum 5 liters for all flights). Calculate crew requirements using the 100% Oxygen
   Duration Chart in the flight manual at 10,000 ft.
      6.24.3.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
      and readily available for use from before starting engines until engine shutdown. NOTE:
      Crewmember pre-flight will include communication checks to include quick don and/or
      helmet and mask.
      6.24.3.2. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 ft cabin
      altitude (except HALO).
      6.24.3.3. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have
      an EEBD, EPOS, or other approved system within arm’s reach for flights above 10,000
      ft.
      6.24.3.4. On missions carrying passengers, distribute EPOS to each passenger regardless
      of planned flight altitude. EPOS will be distributed and their use demonstrated before
      departure.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  89


     6.24.3.5. Walk-around bottles will not be considered a primary source of supplemental
     oxygen for crewmembers performing duties in a primary crew position. Furthermore,
     walk-around bottles will not be considered as a source of supplemental oxygen for any
     crewmember during unpressurized operations above 10,000 ft MSL.
     6.24.3.6. Do not remove the LMs emergency equipment (cargo compartment quick
     dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crew members.
  6.24.4. Life Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers
  than wing well life rafts will accommodate.
  6.24.5. Life Preserver Units (LPUs). The LM will place an LPU within easy reach of each
  passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on overwater flights. Crewmembers will fit
  and adjust LPUs for overwater flights and will wear them on overwater missions below 2,000
  ft. (except for takeoffs, approaches, or landings). NOTE: Parachutists will provide their
  own LPUs. The flying unit will notify the supported unit when route of flight requires the
  use of LPUs. NOTE: Infil/Exfil operations may preclude issuing LPUs to user personnel.
  In this case, carry sufficient LPUs on board for all personnel.
     6.24.5.1. Crewmembers wearing a parachute or harness during air refueling overwater
     will also wear an LPU.
     6.24.5.2. Ensure the appropriate number and type of LPUs are on board for overwater
     missions carrying children and infants.
  6.24.6. Anti-exposure suits. Anti-exposure suits will be available during overwater flights
  when route of flight is beyond power-off gliding distance from land and the water
  temperature is 60°F or below (except when only the approach or departure is flown over
  water.)
     6.24.6.1. If the water temperature ranges between 51°F and 60°F, the unit or mission
     commander may waive or extend the anti-exposure suit requirement after carefully
     considering factors such as: climate zone and existing weather throughout range of
     flight, operational requirements, time of flight over water, risk based on aircraft load and
     mission        configuration,      degree      of      surveillance      over       mission,
     location/availability/capability of SAR forces (consider anticipated time in the water prior
     to pick-up), winds and wave height and their impact on SAR forces, altitude and distance
     from land.
  6.24.7. Parachutes and Restraint Harness. Configure all aircraft with one parachute for each
  crewmember.
     6.24.7.1. Crewmembers should wear parachutes during combat and hazardous
     acceptance flights. EXCEPTION: Unit or mission commanders may authorize
     crewmembers to size and stow their parachutes in an easily accessible location. A
     restraint harness may be used in lieu of a parachute IAW paragraph 6.24.7.2, 6.24.7.3
     and 16.34. However, a parachute must be fitted and stowed in an easily accessible
     location for each crewmember using a restraint harness.
     6.24.7.2. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
     in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or wear a parachute.
 90                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.24.7.3. LMs will wear a restraining harness instead of a parachute during airdrops
       below 800 ft AGL or when performing duties near an open exit above 14,000 ft MSL.
       For additional guidance see paragraph 16.34.
   6.24.8. Survival Kits/Vests. Configure all aircraft with one survival kit (ML-4) for each
   crewmember. Use survival vests in lieu of survival kits if the mission will not be conducted
   beyond gliding distance of land. Individuals should wear survival vests on all combat and
   contingency missions.
   6.24.9. Protective Headgear and Eye Protection.
       6.24.9.1. All crewmembers will preflight and wear their helmets during contingency and
       combat missions at the discretion of deployed commander.
       6.24.9.2. Mobile crewmembers in the cargo compartment will wear helmets, with the
       chinstrap fastened, during all actual airdrop operations from the Twenty-Minute Warning
       through the completion of the airdrop checklist. WARNING: Personnel in the cargo
       compartment will not be seated under the anchor cables or static line retriever cables that
       are rigged for use, unless cargo compartment configuration or mission requirements
       dictate otherwise. In that event, protective headgear will be worn. Personnel will not
       position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-frames, FS 737)
       during personnel or equipment airdrops requiring the use of the anchor cable.
       6.24.9.3. Eye Protection. All personnel aft of FS 617 will lower helmet visors or wear
       eye protection on all airdrops, PR, HAAR, and pyrotechnic missions requiring doors to
       be open. NVGs do not satisfy the requirement for eye protection.
6.25. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. See
Chapter 14 for more specific guidance.
6.26. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for
Military Air Shipment, contains a description of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that
may be carried. PICs are responsible for ensuring all procedures contained in AFMAN 24-204,
AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft carrying Hazardous Materials, and any other
applicable guidance are complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
   6.26.1. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of the cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
   6.26.2. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204.
       6.26.2.1. The military host is responsible for displaying the proper placards on the
       aircraft. For non-military installations, the briefing to the PIC will include the placard
       requirements and, if required, placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper
       must make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous
       materials requiring placards. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, fire-
       fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
   6.26.3. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  91


     6.26.3.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo", “Inert Device” (or both), and the mission number,
     PPR number, or flight number in the “Other information” or “Remarks” section of DD
     Form 1801 or DD Form 175, unless prohibited by directives that govern the area of
     operation. Refer to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight
     when transporting hazardous materials cargo.
     6.26.3.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
     otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
     6.26.3.3. Prepare a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
     will include: class of hazardous material, DoD class or division for explosives, net
     explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If required, request special handling (e.g.,
     isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
         6.26.3.3.1. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely
         message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and information
         listed above in paragraph 6.26.3.3. If available, C2 will relay required information
         to the next destination.
  6.26.4. Before Engine Start. Confirm placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
  parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify the fire-fighting agency has the
  hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire-fighting
  agency: class of hazardous material, DoD class or division for explosives, net explosive
  weight (NEW), and estimated time of departure.
  6.26.5. Before Landing. Unless specifically prohibited by the theater commander or FLIP
  planning accomplish the following:
     6.26.5.1. Contact base operations, control tower, approach control, or other agency
     specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) prior to arrival to announce
     that hazardous materials are on board, and to verify the appropriate base support agencies
     have received the departure message. If not received, notify the next destination of the
     ETA and information listed in paragraph 6.26.3.3.
         6.26.5.1.1. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
         information to the nearest FAA flight service station. Request the information be
         relayed immediately to the civil airport manager, fire-fighting agency, and other
         support agencies (if required).
  6.26.6. Parking. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
  explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in
  areas isolated from personnel. PICs must correctly identify cargo to the tower and ground
  control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo again to tower
  or ground control. Once identification is acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for
  selecting the parking area. Should host procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as
  appropriate, to document such occurrences.
  6.26.7. Unscheduled Landing Due to IFE. In addition to standard declaration of the IFE,
  transmit unclassified information including hazardous materials on board, location of the
  cargo, and applicable information listed in paragraph 6.26.3.3 to the appropriate air traffic
  control facility.
 92                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.26.7.1. After unscheduled landing, contact the ACC Command Center or theater
       command post by telephone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous
       materials information, and other pertinent information as required.
6.27. Hazardous Medical Equipment. Nonstandard hazardous medical equipment possessed
by medical facilities using ACC air evacuation services should be regarded as potentially
hazardous. Two types of equipment of major concern are:
   6.27.1. Electronic Medical Equipment. This type of equipment produces electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) which is commonly beyond the limits specified by MIL STD 461A and
   462, and therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
   For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.27.1.1. Pararescue personnel must inform the PIC when nonstandard electronic
       medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft. In addition, the PIC must be
       informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment during the mission.
       6.27.1.2. The PIC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
       navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
       6.27.1.3. If continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of the
       mission, flight is restricted to VFR conditions.
   6.27.2. Therapeutic Oxygen Systems. These systems present an increased hazard of fire or
   explosion. A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
   regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories. For
   nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.27.2.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulator will be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axes.
       6.27.2.2. Pararescue personnel will continually monitor the operation of the equipment to
       detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.28. Handling Procedures. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission
Capable (MICAP) Parts, Very, Very Important Parts (VVIP), Forward Supply System
(FSS) Shipments, and Courier Material. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials,
and registered mail moving within the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload
stations using the air cargo manifest. For unit moves operated IAW Defense Transportation
Regulation (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally
manifested utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, Cargo Manifest or similar automated product (such as
CALM or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD1907,
Signature and Tally Record, must be used.
   6.28.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are authorized to
   designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military aircraft as couriers to
   escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified personnel are not available.
   Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before designating crewmembers. The
   following restrictions apply:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     93


       6.28.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent of
       the PIC.
       6.28.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended enroute stop at a
       location where DCS couriers cannot provide enroute support will not be designated as
       couriers.
   6.28.2. During stops at enroute locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
       6.28.2.1. During unscheduled enroute stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority:
          6.28.2.1.1. DCS courier.
          6.28.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
          6.28.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
          6.28.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
          6.28.2.1.5. US military guards.
          6.28.2.1.6. US DoD civilian guards.
   6.28.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest DCS station and
   notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   6.28.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD 1907, for unit moves. The PIC will be briefed on the urgency
   of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.29. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if airborne no later than 15 minutes
after the scheduled takeoff time. PICs may depart up to 30 minutes early provided the aircrew
evaluates local and down-range impacts and no adverse effect will result.
6.30. NVG Departures.
   6.30.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Pilots may use NVGs to assist in instrument
   takeoffs as mission requirements dictate. Weather minimums for NVG departures for pilots
   who are current and qualified is 1 mile visibility. Weather minimums for NVG departures
   for pilots who are non-current or unqualified is 1500/3. Crews must give careful
   consideration to potential hazards during this critical phase of flight. Other weather
   limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
   which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather
   conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and
   weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
 94                                 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   6.30.2. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences
   NVG failure, takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC. If NVG malfunctions
   occur after the PM states “rotate,” consideration should be given to either continuing the
   takeoff as an overt instrument takeoff or transferring control of the aircraft as the situation
   dictates. If either pilot’s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climb out and follow the
   appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs. The PM will be ready to immediately assume
   aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction.
   WARNING: NVGs and associated components (battery cords, safety cords, and other
   hardware) can become entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other
   controls. Pilots must exercise extreme care during seat changes as any interference can cause
   inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of other critical switches or controls.
6.31. Departure Monitoring. The CSO and PM will back up the PF and report any deviations
from the planned departure.

Section 6E—En Route

6.32. IFF/SIF Operations.
   6.32.1. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV using
   either the self-test or ground radar interrogator (ground test assets permitting). If the self-test
   fails and radar facilities do not permit a ground check, takeoff is authorized if the IFF/SIF
   was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish an airborne check immediately after
   takeoff.
      6.32.1.1. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff or
      cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode IV, except when the aircraft will transit an area
      where safe passage procedures are implemented.
   6.32.2. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV may continue to their intended destination if use is
   no longer required. If use is required, repairs will be accomplished at the first destination
   where equipment, parts, and maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe
   passage is implemented, aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode IV as directed
   in the applicable Airspace Control Order or Air Tasking Order.
   6.32.3. Use the IFF/SIF IAW Table 6.5. NOTE: Once set and transmitted, IFF/SIF modes
   1, 2, and 3/A codes are unclassified and may be left in the transponder.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      95

  4     Keyed and On when required
6.33. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigation aids to monitor Mission Computer
performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
centerline accuracy to the controlling radar facility. See Chapter 11 for procedures to monitor
flight progress.
   6.33.1. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP for further
   guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
   government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter
   their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through
   US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
       6.33.1.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and
       territorial airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states’
       territorial seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by
       the coastal state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic
       waters, inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be
       conducted in such areas only with consent of the sovereign country.
       6.33.1.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs.
       Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
       operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
       provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
       by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
       beyond 12 NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
       limits which differ from the standard.
       6.33.1.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which
       flight information and related services are provided. A FIR does not reflect international
       borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
       approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
       6.33.1.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
       into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
       amend entry point(s).
 96                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.33.1.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
       departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
       clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
       6.33.1.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
       penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
       country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
       6.33.1.7. In the event an ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or
       attempts to negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The
       normal response will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will
       continue to planned destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is
       “in international airspace.” Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
       continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes
       their mission over sovereign airspace not approved through diplomatic channels before
       mission departure, as being valid authorization.
       6.33.1.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
       transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
       6.33.1.9. Due Regard Procedures. Aircrews normally are not tasked to and should not
       fly “due regard” routings unless coordinated and authorized by the unit commander. The
       “due regard” or “operational” option obligates the military aircraft to be their own ATC
       agency to separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements
       dictate, the PIC may exercise the “due regard” option to protect their aircraft. The
       aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical. Fly “due regard”
       procedures IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FLIP GP “Operations and Firings over the High
       Seas.”
6.34. Cold Weather Altimeter Setting Procedures. Apply cold weather altimeter corrections
for non-tactical operations IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FIH. For tactical operations, apply cold
weather altimeter corrections to any reference barometric altitude, e.g. MSA, ESA, NVG
reference altitude, drop altitude, SCA backup altitudes, SCA minimums, etc., used during low
level operations whenever the outside air temperature is below 32º F/0º C.
6.35. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Operations. Comply with AFI 11-202V3,
General Flight Rules.
   6.35.1. Mission requirements may allow selection of TA Only when operating from parallel
   runways, in the visual traffic pattern, or during air refueling operations since the proximity to
   aircraft may result in unwarranted RAs. In addition, excessive climb/descent rates could lead
   to an inadvertent TA/RA. Reducing climb/descent rates near level off can limit inadvertent
   TCAS advisories.
6.36. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in
FLIP, and are considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, RVSM, RNP, and BRNAV.
For further details about specific airspace procedures and restrictions, see Chapter 11.
6.37. Communications. Make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling
agency.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                       97


   6.37.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF
   radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact
   before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling
   HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base.
6.38. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports.
   6.38.1. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FIH.
   6.38.2. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also, attempt
   to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.38.3. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFMAN 10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.39. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not consume meals at the same time, and their meals
should consist of different menu items.
6.40. In-Flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures. Crews will report deviations from directives
that occur as a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3, and this instruction.
   6.40.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and
   any other pertinent information.
   6.40.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL when additional expertise is
   necessary. This procedure will make aircraft specialists accessible to the aircrew when in-
   flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at the local level.
   See AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision, for contact information and further details.
      6.40.2.1. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete
      frequencies. When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch
      with the nearest or controlling C2 agency. Provide a narrative description of the situation
      including actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired.
   6.40.3. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft.
   6.40.4. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on three engines to its
   destination if two-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both
   enroute and at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all
 98                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   times. If these conditions cannot be met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility
   (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the PIC, offers safe and favorable operating
   conditions.
   6.40.5. Fuel Jettison. Fuel will not be jettisoned except in combat, emergency conditions, or
   rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.
       6.40.5.1. Advise ATC should it become necessary to jettison fuel.
6.41. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel
may meet the aircraft. Notification will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the
nature of the medical problem.
   6.41.1. Suspected Laser Exposure. If laser exposure is suspected, the PIC will ensure
   appropriate C2, intelligence, safety, and medical agencies are notified as soon as possible.
   Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile sources
   should report to the Flight Surgeon’s office or nearest emergency room where the individual
   can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing.
6.42. Weather Forecasts. The PIC will ensure destination weather is obtained prior to descent
for landing. NOTE: For all flights outside the local area, the CSO/PM will obtain the
destination and alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and temperature,
before reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA.
   6.42.1. The primary sources for in-flight weather assistance is Operational Weather
   Squadron (OWS), Pilot-to-Meteorological Service (PMSV), or through a USAF aeronautical
   station. Refer to the FIH for weather agency contact information. The ATC system can
   provide weather information to enroute aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.43. Descent. Crews should plan and initiate their descent to comply with ATC arrival and
instrument approach procedures. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots and CSO will
review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions.
Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and
approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing. The
PM and CSO will monitor the approach and report any deviations from prescribed procedures.
   6.43.1. Pilots and CSO will crosscheck radar altimeters during descent to verify adequate
   terrain clearance throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the approach.
   6.43.2. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational/training
   requirements dictate.
6.44. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.44.1. Aircraft category. The HC-130J is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds
   exceed 140 knots, the minimums for category "D" will be used.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  99


  6.44.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
  with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
  6.44.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an
  enroute descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
     6.44.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
         6.44.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
         meters) or ½ mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
         6.44.3.1.2. CAT I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be
         as published, but no lower than a 200 ft height above touchdown (HAT).
     6.44.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
         6.44.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
         required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 ft rounded
         up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 ft, add 100 ft
         to get 847 ft and then round up to the next one hundred foot value which would be
         900 ft. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 ft.) When circling
         minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach minimums will be as
         published, but in no case lower than:
             6.44.3.2.1.1. Category C - 500 ft - 1 1/2 SM.
             6.44.3.2.1.2. Category D - 600 ft - 2 SM.
     6.44.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM
     or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach
     lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs,
     PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
  6.44.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
     6.44.4.1. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT I ILS and precision approach radar (PAR)
     includes a HUD or PFD at each station, and no shared CADC or INU attitude reference.
     6.44.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT II ILS includes an operational HUD in
     the PF position, a HUD or PFD at the PM position, and meeting the flight manual CAT II
     ILS criteria.
     6.44.4.3. Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300 ft and RVR 4000 or
     3/4 SM visibility (1220 meters) with no RVR if full flight instrumentation is not
     operational.
  6.44.5. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to
  conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational procedures:
     6.44.5.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
     6.44.5.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
     6.44.5.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA ATCSCC
     at 800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated arrival time. Pilots
     who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach clearance and did not
 100                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC directed divert to a non-PRM
       airport.
       6.44.5.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
       disengaged when a breakout is directed.
       6.44.5.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the PF shall
       immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
       clearance, the PM shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
       comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the PF determines
       safety to be a factor.
   6.44.6. CAT II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. Minimum HAT is 100 ft.
   Minimum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots. Crosswind of 15 knots
   may be used for training approaches (requires weather of 200 – ½ or greater).
       6.44.6.1. The following airfield and aircraft equipment must be operational (AFMAN
       11-230, Instrument Procedures).
          6.44.6.1.1. Approach lights.
          6.44.6.1.2. Runway centerline lighting.
          6.44.6.1.3. High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights.
          6.44.6.1.4. Approach end transmissometer.
          6.44.6.1.5. ILS far field monitor.
          6.44.6.1.6. Sequenced flashers.
       6.44.6.2. Aircrews will not execute an IMC CAT II ILS to minimums unless both pilots
       are qualified and current in Category II ILS.
       6.44.6.3. When performing CAT II ILS procedures on a CAT I ILS for
       training/evaluations, the DH is the HAT for the CAT I ILS.
       6.44.6.4. Refer to AFI 11-217V1 regarding equipment failure and go-around criteria.
   6.44.7. NDB Procedures. The HUD alone is not sufficient for NDB approaches. A head-
   down display, which depicts a bearing pointer tuned to the NDB, must be used in conjunction
   with the HUD throughout the approach. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or
   IMC conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS2/ASRR. Pilots
   should back up each approach with available NAVAIDSs/GPS to include loading the NDB
   coordinates in the FMS.
6.45. After Beginning an Enroute Descent. Do not continue a CAT II ILS if the weather is
reported to be below CAT II minimums.
   6.45.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment is in
   sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
   6.45.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
   approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel reserve.
   6.45.3. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to at or above minimums provided:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     101


       6.45.3.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.45.3.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.46. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.46.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and pilots who are non-current and/or unqualified is
   1500/3. Current and qualified NVG pilots may fly IFR approaches with weather at approach
   minimums. Crews must give careful consideration to potential hazards during this critical
   phase of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3.
   NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions.
   Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn
   and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
   6.46.2. NVG Malfunction during Approach and Landing. If either pilot experiences NVG
   failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC whether or not to transition to an
   overt landing or perform a go-around. The PM will be ready to immediately assume aircraft
   control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. If the PFs NVGs
   fail after touchdown, transfer control of the aircraft to the PM, if required, for the landing
   rollout. Use overt landing and taxi lights for illumination until both pilots are ready to
   resume NVG operations.
6.47. Salt Spray and Clear Water Rinse. The accumulation of salt spray on windshields and
side windows is a hazard that must be considered for low-level overwater flight. Weigh this
against mission urgency prior to descent below 500 ft, when heavy seas or high surface winds
exist. In some cases, it will be preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this condition.
   6.47.1. Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the
   aircraft is flown over salt water below 3,000 ft AGL, including tactical approaches and
   landings. Two or more approaches over salt water require a clear water rinse after the last
   flight of the day IAW T.O. 1-1-691, Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention and Control,
   Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment. EXCEPTION: Aircraft equipped with Large
   Aircraft Infrared Counter Measures (LAIRCM) Small Laser Turret Assemblies (SLTA) will
   not utilize the bird bath with the turrets installed due to water intrusion problems.
   6.47.2. If a birdbath facility is unavailable make the following annotation in the AFTO Form
   781A, “Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray, Birdbath Unavailable.”
   6.47.3. Clear water rinse facility (birdbath) usage guidelines are as follows:
       6.47.3.1. Deactivate all sensors, such as the LPCR and EO-IR, prior to entering the
       birdbath.
       6.47.3.2. The APU will remain off with doors closed to prevent flameout and flooding of
       the APU compartment.
       6.47.3.3. Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extend landing lights.
 102                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.47.3.4. All four engines should be at normal ground idle. Two engines in normal
       ground idle, and two in LSGI may be used if aircraft weight does not restrict forward
       movement through the bath.
       6.47.3.5. As full water spray begins, taxi slowly on centerline at a rate which allows
       adequate rinsing of the aircraft. Hold nose wheel steering centered and start windshield
       wipers. Exercise flight controls while in the birdbath.
       6.47.3.6. Complete the AFTER LANDING checklist after rinse is completed. Run
       engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine
       nacelles. NOTE: Each birdbath is unique in design and function. Review local
       procedures for birdbath operating guidelines including direction of entry, wing tip
       clearance criteria, and noise abatement concerns. NOTE: It is possible to experience an
       overheat indication during or immediately following the birdbath due to water intrusion
       into overheat warning systems. Each crew will analyze the indication and make a
       judgment as to the emergency action to be taken.
6.48. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, the PIC
and any crewmembers documenting a maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance
personnel on the condition of the aircraft and subsystems as required. The PIC will review the
aircraft forms, determine those discrepancies considered as mission essential, and indicate them
by entering “ME” in block letters in the lower left hand corner of the discrepancy block. Enter
“MC” for mission contributing discrepancies to indicate any discrepancies that, if not corrected,
would substantially affect mission accomplishment, but are not mission essential. At stations
where there is no maintenance, and maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a
thorough debrief is provided to the controlling C2 agency prior to entering crew rest.
   6.48.1. Documentation of Fuel Onload/Offload. Document all fuel onloaded/offloaded in
   the AFTO Form 781H.
6.49. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. The PIC is responsible for
ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings, even when qualified
maintenance specialists are unavailable.
   6.49.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       6.49.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       6.49.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
       6.49.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       6.49.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       6.49.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       6.49.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       6.49.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   6.49.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   6.49.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  103


   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
6.50. Crew Debriefing. The PIC will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The debriefing
will include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crewmembers may be excused from debrief at the discretion of the PIC.
6.51. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command IAW DTR 4500.9R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part V, Department
of Defense Customs and Border Clearance Policy and Procedures, AFI 24-203, Preparation and
Movement of Air Force Cargo, applicable FCG, and other US entry requirements and related
areas.
   6.51.1. Normal Operations.
       6.51.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.51.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or the LM, but the PIC retains ultimate
       responsibility. When an HC-130J aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
       function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.51.1.2.1. Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, if
          required.
          6.51.1.2.2. Crewmembers and passengers have current certificates of immunization
          (shot records).
          6.51.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.51.1.2.4. Departure or arrival to the US is through a port of entry where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.51.1.2.5. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if
          required, is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.51.1.2.6. Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see FCG and paragraph
          6.52).
   6.51.2. Procedures for US Entry.
       6.51.2.1. Enroute, the LM will distribute personal customs declarations to all passengers
       and crewmembers. The LM will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs
       regulations, and prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PICs
       signature.
       6.51.2.2. Enroute, notify the base of intended landing of any change in ETA, to ensure
       border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
       6.51.2.3. Obtain a Permit to Proceed when the mission requires an aircraft, which has
       landed in the US for customs clearance, to proceed to another US base to obtain border
104                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      clearance. The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until
      arrival at the offload station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally
      required for customs inspection. The permit is valid only to the airport of next landing,
      where the border clearance must be completed, or a new permit obtained. Do not make
      intermediate stops unless required by an emergency, or directed by the controlling
      agency.
      6.51.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
      normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane passengers
      or crewmembers unless necessary for safety (i.e. flare safety check) or preservation of
      life and property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or
      their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US
      and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border
      clearance.
  6.51.3. Inspections of US Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
      6.51.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in chapter 3
      (General Information) of the FCG. This policy holds that US military aircraft are
      immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
      inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
      specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
      6.51.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
      consider the following procedures:
         6.51.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement to the
         foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without
         consent of HQ USAF or the US Department of State in the country concerned. This
         should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities
         that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF
         aircraft.
         6.51.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must make
         every effort to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF (through
         MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate American Embassy. The PIC should unequivocally
         state that they have no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the
         host nation request to these agencies for decision. The PIC should then notify these
         agencies of the request by the most expeditious means available and follow their
         instructions. NOTE: If necessary, the crew will seal the aircraft, enter crew rest, and
         cancel departure intentions until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority.
         6.51.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
         indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and
         mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
         6.51.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board the aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action
         being pursued and that they intend to notify both HQ USAF and the appropriate
         American Embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should then allow the foreign
         agents onboard the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                               105


         incident to HQ USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible. NOTE: Other
         procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment. These
         instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the FCG should be
         followed, where applicable.
  6.51.4. Exercise and Contingency Operations.
     6.51.4.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
     require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immigration, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding
     establishes procedures and waivers.
     6.51.4.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of
     the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be
     accomplished at the US onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at
     the foreign onload or offload base.
  6.51.5. Customs Procedures.
     6.51.5.1. Outbound. No requirement. Filing of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
     Form 7507 is not required unless directed.
     6.51.5.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
         6.51.5.2.1. CBP 7507 (passenger list not required).
         6.51.5.2.2. Cargo manifest.
         6.51.5.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days:
            6.51.5.2.3.1. Troop commander’s certificate for examination of troop baggage.
            6.51.5.2.3.2. One copy of DD Form 1854 or CBP Form 6059B for each
            passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include observers,
            support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
            6.51.5.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs representative
            will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's certificate with respect to
            troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop
            commander should have inspected troop baggage. Troops will debark under the
            observation of the customs representative with only a spot check of articles and
            baggage. The customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
         6.51.5.2.4. For troops out of the country 140 days or more:
            6.51.5.2.4.1. One copy of DD Form 1854 or CBP Form 6059B for each
            passenger and crewmember.
            6.51.5.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs representative
            will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will debark under the
            observation of the customs representative, who may make discretionary
            examination of the baggage.
  6.51.6. Immigration Procedures.
     6.51.6.1. Outbound. No requirement.
 106                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       6.51.6.2. Inbound. Submit the following to the Immigration inspector.
          6.51.6.2.1. One copy of CBP Form7507
   6.51.7. Agriculture Procedures.
       6.51.7.1. Outbound. No requirement.
       6.51.7.2. Inbound. Consult FCG.
          6.51.7.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit, milk,
          milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat, and animal
          products can be brought into the US. All items of troop personal gear/cargo are to be
          thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign material before brought on
          board the aircraft. Personal gear and equipment must be examined for snails and
          other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the US.
          6.51.7.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted will
          clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
          6.51.7.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or higher
          HQ, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes before landing.
          6.51.7.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after troops
          have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight lunches for
          prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
          6.51.7.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as offloaded.
          Any items found to be contaminated will be held for such treatment as the inspector
          may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.51.8. Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program.
       6.51.8.1. The military customs program outlined in DTR 4500.9R Part V, chapter 506
       was developed to assist DoD and other US Government agencies in the control of
       narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD
       personnel and material into the customs territory of the US.
       6.51.8.2. Military customs inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior
       to departure and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS-bound
       aircraft. When security considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission
       planners must coordinate with the appropriate agency to prevent jeopardizing the
       mission.
6.52. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).
   6.52.1. Responsibility. The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished IAW AFJI
   48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, FCG, or as directed by higher
   headquarters. Certify the spraying on CBP Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country
   transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only exception is
   when when mandated by the FCG.
       6.52.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, Aerosol D-Phenothrin-2%, NSN
       6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft. Wear leather or Nomex gloves
       while spraying.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 107


          6.52.1.1.1. Aerosol is normally dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic
          ft. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.
          Do not spray plastic surfaces.
          6.52.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, and cargo, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and
          other similar spaces.
          6.52.1.1.3. Spray the cabin (aft to forward), flight deck, and other spaces accessible
          from within the aircraft ensuring all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation
          openings are closed. Exit and close the crew entrance door when complete. Keep all
          doors and hatches closed for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes
          before allowing anyone on board. WARNING: Aerosol D-Phenothrin-2% contains
          hazardous ingredients that when exposed for prolonged periods may become
          hazardous to humans.
       6.52.1.2. Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.52.2. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the
   destination C2 center, airfield management, or airport manager of the situation before landing
   so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.52.3. Upon arrival, do not open doors or hatches except to enplane officials inspecting the
   aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload until the inspection is
   satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous Procedures

6.53. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.53.1. Enter a write-up in the AFTO Form 781A.
   6.53.2. Notify the C2 agency as soon as practical. Include route of flight, altitude, and
   weather conditions (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
6.54. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker (ECB #464).
6.55. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious ground or in-flight
incident, the PIC should impound the aircraft immediately and contact the ACC Command
Center or controlling agency for further instructions.
6.56. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a
point of contact with the C2 agency, base operations, or local airport manager. The PIC will be
notified immediately in case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the
aircraft.
6.57. Flight Deck Loose Objects.
 108                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   6.57.1. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed on the center pedestal in a position
   that covers or hides any switch or light from view. Do not place any item behind the power
   levers.
   6.57.2. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed on the flight deck glare shield.
   6.57.3. Do not hang any item on the flight deck escape ladder higher than the second from
   the bottom rung.
   6.57.4. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck. Additional items will be secured in the cargo compartment.
6.58. Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares on the HC-130J aircraft:
   6.58.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordinance.
   6.58.2. The LM or another qualified crewmember will deplane and check all dispensers for
   hung ordnance. NOTE: ALE-47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung
   ordnance.
   6.58.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected chaff/flare
   cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
   personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
   personnel can clear all hung ordnance.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security, as well as, prevention and
resistance against aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the HC-130J aircraft on the ground and in-flight.
Due to the sensitive nature of anti-hijacking procedures, aircrew members should reference AFI
13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO), AFI 31-101, Integrated
Defense (FOUO), FIH, and any MAJCOM supplements or specific security publications. Some
aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-
401, Information Security Program Management. Aircrews will not release any information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The HC-130J is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-US
military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency. Additional equipment
onboard or installed on the aircraft may result in increased security measures.
7.3. Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft when
located away from US military installations. AFJI 31-102, Physical Security, covers security
arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other DoD installations. Arrangements
must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected locations. If US
military security forces are not available, the US embassy assigned to that country must be
consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For missions involving a planning agency,
the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the planned security measures conform to
mission requirements. The amount of security required will vary, depending on location and
ground time.
   7.3.1. For non-permissive or uncertain environments, airfield and LZ security is the
   responsibility of the agency requesting the airlift. Crews will work with the agency
   requesting the airlift to ensure security meets the requirement for the mission.
   7.3.2. For permissive environments, the PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates enroute, if required. When landing at a DoD component installation, the installation
   commander is responsible to provide adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and PIC will use Table 7.1 to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-US military
   installations overseas and civilian airfields. For unscheduled or emergency landings at non-
   USAF installations, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the following
   actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient: NOTE: Aircrews do posses the
   training to provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft.
       7.3.2.1. Aircrew Surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrew are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed
       crewmembers to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances
       and activities in the aircraft vicinity. Obtain a means to report suspicious or hostile
       activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile radio, cellular phone, etc.)
110                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      7.3.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
      back-up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
      Form 15, USAF Invoice.
      7.3.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
      unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions and depart as soon as possible for a
      destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the location due to system
      malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case,
      will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be
      subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a
      security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until
      relief is available. The PIC will coordinate through home station channels or the nearest
      DoD installation, US embassy, local military, or law enforcement agencies as appropriate
      to acquire additional security.
  7.3.3. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be impractical
  at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other factors. For
  example, some countries don't allow armed security personnel. On other deployments, the
  mission may rely on maintaining a low profile and attracting as little attention as possible.
  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary. As
  a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches. If it is not possible to lock the aircraft,
  secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry (i.e.,
  taping hatch release handles or using seals.) The PIC is the final authority for determining
  tailored security measures. Contact with US Embassy personnel is required at locations
  where security agreements are not in existence.
  7.3.4. Ground Security Teams. Ground security teams may be needed to guard the aircraft
  for planned overnight stops. Teams may be sized as appropriate based on mission
  requirements and threat evaluation (two member’s minimum) and may be made up entirely,
  or in part, by members from other services. Teams may travel in Mission Essential
  Personnel (MEP) status and are responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is
  responsible for their welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.) The PIC will ensure security team
  members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress training, and passenger briefings, as
  appropriate. The squadron commander is the final approval authority for the need of ground
  security teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated to no lower than the PIC.
      7.3.4.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
      Hazardous Materials For Military Air Shipments, at all times when carrying weapons,
      ammo and equipment onboard the aircraft.
      7.3.4.2. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, ground security teams
      will keep their weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if
      the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons
      to be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action
      prior to deployment.
  7.3.5. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
  sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   111


       7.3.5.1. Use the aircraft lock and available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       NOTE: The aircraft will be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight.
       7.3.5.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
       7.3.5.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal.)
       7.3.5.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       forced entry.
       7.3.5.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Thoroughly
       inspect aircraft prior to flight.
       7.3.5.6. Close and seal the main crew entrance door or left troop door using a metal
       boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry. Wipe the immediate
       area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry.
       7.3.5.7. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
       servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
       will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
       personnel.
   7.3.6. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially in high threat, low security locations.
   During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas not normally covered by
   normal pre-flight duties, to include aircraft wheel-wells, air conditioning compartments,
   crew/troop oxygen service panels, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.4. Aircraft Security Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will use this
matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix will be
used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.
A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are
adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. Commanders may consider
additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than 90, commanders should
consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The squadron commander or deployed
commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC. EXCEPTION: During unscheduled or emergency landings,
the PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the US
Embassy or United States Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) for security assistance. NOTE:
Normally, additional security for the aircraft is not required at military installations within a
NATO country or US civilian airfields approved by the FAA/TSA.

7.5. Protective Standards For Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors. This paragraph
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. The PIC is responsible for
aircraft security at enroute stops.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   113


   7.5.1. DoD Installations. Notify base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request security forces maintain continuous security surveillance during the entire
   ground time. If the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.5.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF Form 15.
7.6. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one flight
deck crewmember, and one LM will be armed. All crewmembers should know who is armed.
The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.6.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain
   weapons, ammunition, box (if required), lock, and key. Crewmembers will be armed
   according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and MAJCOM
   publications. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to
   Bear Firearms. Crewmembers will be reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates
   at home station. If an armed crewmember must leave the crew enroute, transfer the weapon
   to another authorized crewmember using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.6.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities, if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.6.3. Wearing of Weapons for Anti-Hijacking. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all
   times to protect the identity of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line,
   except to and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities
   such as base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias,
   snack bars, etc.
      7.6.3.1. Military Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
      identify themselves to military passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
      checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
      identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
      the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
      the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
      proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
      will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.6.4. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway
   check. If no gun box is available retain weapon for the duration of the flight. Crewmembers
   will rearm before landing. Weapons should not be unloaded before placing them in a gun
   box.
   7.6.5. Weapons Storage on the Ground. Aircraft gun box use is acceptable at military base
   locations providing the aircrew coordinates with base security forces so they can provide a 24
   hour guard at the aircraft.
   7.6.6. When storing weapons in the gun box:
 114                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       7.6.6.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.6.6.2. Inform C2/base       operations    which    crewmember      has    the   gun    box
       key/combination.
   7.6.7. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable, or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
       7.6.7.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
       overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
       nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military
       services armories, US National Guard and Reserve armories, and US civil law
       enforcement armories. If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons
       security may be compromised, crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters.
       One crewmember will remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the
       ammunition over to the PIC.
   7.6.8. Due to the dynamic nature of contingency and combat operations, unit commanders
   may designate all aircrew as arming group B for the purpose of aircraft/resource protection
   for the following weapons: M-9, M-14/M-16 or equivalent, and M-870, IAW AFI 13-207
   and AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
7.7. Standby/Alert Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door with a box car seal, or other controllable device,
which will prevent entry without damaging the door or lock. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency
the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate
the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a
sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or
designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the
aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
sealed, and flown by another aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for
documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.8. Enroute Security. If required, a ground security team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.8.1. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.8.1.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.8.1.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.9. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.9.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     115


   7.9.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.9.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.9.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.9.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.9.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.9.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.9.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.9.9. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the PIC of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the anti-
   hijacking effort.
7.10. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. Aircrews must make every
reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to
direct physical confrontation, including the use of deadly force. Due to the sensitive nature of
anti-hijacking procedures, crewmembers should reference AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting
Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO), MAJCOM Sup. to AFI 13-207, and the FIH for more
specific guidance. Aircrews will not release any information concerning those procedures or
hijacking attempts. Anti-hijacking is a crew duty performed exclusively by aircrew personnel.
The hijacking of an USAF aircraft could create a serious international incident and jeopardize the
safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most vulnerable when the crew is on board and
the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are
mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a
deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and
property. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the
problem. Passenger terminals will be used for passenger screening to the maximum extent
possible.
   7.10.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing or manifesting
   facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until the PIC is
   fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service
   representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage
116                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


  is accomplished. EXCEPTION: Supporting/supported forces may be anti-hijack inspected
  at the aircraft by the aircrew.
      7.10.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
      passenger screening and carry-on allowances.
         7.10.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure thorough screenings are accomplished when
         processing passengers at locations without a military passenger terminal.
         7.10.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
         the passenger terminal. Carry-on restrictions do not apply to personnel not required
         to process through the passenger terminal. This includes:
             7.10.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that
             mission.
             7.10.1.1.2.2. MEPs for that mission.
         7.10.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in-flight as
         checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
         is not limited to segregated baggage compartments, floor loaded baggage tied down
         with cargo straps/chains, palletized baggage, and baggage in baggage bins.
         7.10.1.1.4. Brief passengers, required to process through the passenger terminal, or
         equivalent, that baggage in these areas will not be accessed in-flight. If these
         passengers attempt to access checked baggage in-flight, all attempts shall be made to
         stop the passengers from accessing the baggage. Land the aircraft at the nearest
         suitable airport (preferably a military facility) with appropriate law enforcement
         personnel. If needed, request assistance removing the passenger(s) and any
         accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law enforcement direction.
  7.10.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of
  patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will
  perform required inspections prior to loading.
      7.10.2.1. For aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, the Medical Crew Director (MCD)
      is the final authority for determining what medical items can be carried by/for AE
      patients.
  7.10.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
  movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
  and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
  7.10.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
  baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
  State Department, designated security team members, and other individuals specifically
  authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC. In all cases the crew will be aware
  of location of weapons and ammunition.
      7.10.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
      aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
      weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. EXCEPTION:
      During combat operations, troops may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition on board
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   117


       the aircraft. When the tactical situation dictates, personnel who will engage an enemy
       force immediately upon deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons aboard the
       aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader, with the PIC’s concurrence.
       Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.
       7.10.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the
       order of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.10.4.3. Designated security teams will only be armed in-flight on specifically
       designated missions identified on the mission “frag” as “in-flight arming required.”
   7.10.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.10.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 ft from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.10.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.              Ensure
       troop/aircraft commander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.10.4.1.
7.11. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.11.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.11.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.11.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.11.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.11.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.11.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.11.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.11.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, for additional guidance.
7.12. In-Flight Resistance. In the event of a hijacking, crewmembers must act immediately and
resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter the attacker successfully. Many variables
of a hijacking preclude use of any specific counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors
should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the nature of the
threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the
hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the
aircrew may consider are:
 118                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   7.12.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.12.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.12.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.12.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.12.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
   7.12.6. In any suspected or actual hijack attempt, the aircrew basic objective is to get the
   aircraft on the ground as quickly as possible and keep it there. If the pilot needs to land
   quickly, the pilot will request an emergency descent clearance from ATC.
7.13. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Notify ground agencies as
soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as circumstances permit. Covert signals
are no longer used per FAA guidance.
7.14. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.15. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), requirements for C-130 aircraft:
   7.15.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   via a roving patrol, a two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT), with immediate
   response not to exceed 3 minutes, and a two-person External Security Response Team
   (ESRT), with response capability within 5 minutes.
   7.15.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available,
   establish a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with
   restricted area signs. Provide a one-person mobile patrol, supported by a two-person ISRT
   capable of a 5 minute response. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours
   of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not available.
   7.15.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.15.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.15.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.15.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock and seal the aircraft during a “remain over night” (RON)
   on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.3.5.) NOTE: The aircraft will be locked during all
   off-station missions remaining overnight.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                119


7.16. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's
Personal Protection Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism

AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  123


       8.7.1.1. Attachments should include; notification of incident, crew orders, statement of
       crewmembers (if applicable), and documenting evidence (logs, charts, etc.)
   8.7.2. In addition to the information listed, the historical flight plan will be electronically
   downloaded and turned in to the C2 center or owning standardization and evaluation office.
   8.7.3. Send the original investigation report within 45 days to HQ ACC/IG.
   8.7.4. The following OPREP-3, Event or Incident Report reporting procedures for all aircraft
   notified of navigational errors exceeding 24 NMs will be reported under AFI10-206,
   Operational Reporting:
       8.7.4.1. On notification of a navigational position error, the PIC (or agency receiving
       notification) documents the circumstances surrounding the incident (report content
       below) and ensures submission of an OPREP-3 report through C2 channels.
       8.7.4.2. Include the following:
          8.7.4.2.1. Name and location of unit submitting report, mission identification
          number, reference to related OPREPs-3, type of event (e.g., state "navigation position
          error"), date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., ARTCC area.)
          8.7.4.2.2. Description of facts and circumstances. Include aircraft type and tail
          number, unit (wing/group or squadron assignment of crew), home base, route of
          flight, point of alleged deviation, and miles off course.
          8.7.4.2.3. PICs must keep the appropriate agencies apprised of any unusual events or
          circumstances impacting their missions. Examples of reportable events include
          meaconing, jamming, intrusion, interception, fuel dumping, loss of multiple engines,
          hostile fire, injury to passengers or crewmembers, etc. This list is not exhaustive.
          Some events may require the C2 agency to forward OPREP reports to higher
          headquarters. The old adage, "when in doubt, report it," applies.
8.8. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel
and Services at Commercial Locations. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card for
the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the “platinum” MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants can
be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.8.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.8.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
124                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      8.8.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts. NOTE:
      DoD FLIP enroute supplements identify locations with into-plane contracts.
      8.8.2.2. Foreign government air forces.
  8.8.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
      8.8.3.1. The DD1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at
      other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the
      DD1898 inside the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log. The PIC or
      designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a
      unique invoice along with the DD1898, annotate the vendor’s invoice with
      “DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.”
      8.8.3.2. The AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
      AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form and
      insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF Form 664, with supporting
      forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC or
      designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
      8.8.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
      ground services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.
         8.8.3.3.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
             8.8.3.3.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an
             FBO refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and
             attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the
             SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a
             separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the FBO

                                          Chapter 11

                              NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General.
   11.1.1. Definitions and Terminology.
      11.1.1.1. Category I (CAT I) Route. Any route that does not meet the requirements of a
      CAT II route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes.
      11.1.1.2. Category II (CAT II) Route. Any route on which the position of the aircraft
      can be accurately determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid (NDB, VOR) or
      intersection of at least two radio aid radials (VOR, TACAN) or one radial (VOR,
      TACAN) and one DME at least once each hour.
      11.1.1.3. Controlling Navigation Solution. The controlling EGI (INAV) navigation
      solution the mission computer is using for enroute navigation. The SHIP SOLN, selected
      via the NAV SELECT page of the AMU, determines which will be used to steer the
      aircraft either manually or with the autopilot.
      11.1.1.4. First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF). Utilized in
      the equal time point (ETP) calculation. These are represented as the “First Nearest” and
      the “Last Nearest” airports in the ETP calculation in the PROGRESS pages of the CNI-
      MU. They are airports closest to the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet
      applicable criteria for HC-130J operations. Forecast weather for the FSAF and LSAF
      must meet destination weather minimum filing requirements.
      11.1.1.5. Equal Time Point (ETP). Geographic point along the route from which the
      flight time to the FSAF or the LSAF is equal.
      11.1.1.6. Required Navigation Performance (RNP). RNP accuracy standards require an
      aircraft to remain within a specific number of nautical miles of its cleared course
      centerline for 95% of the duration of the flight. The associated track containment limit is
      twice the RNP value and represents the maximum limit of protected airspace. Airspace
      where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and
      the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. RNP airspace is
      being incorporated around the world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing
      separation requirements between routes. Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts
      to determine RNP airspace.
      11.1.1.7. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace. MNPS
      airspace exists in both the North Atlantic Region (NAT) and certain Canadian portions of
      the North American Region. Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts to
      determine MNPS airspace. The HC-130J must comply with all MNPS equipment
      requirements when flying within the lateral dimensions of this airspace (consult FLIP for
      mandatory equipment). Aircraft meeting the North Atlantic MNPS requirements also
      meet the Canadian MNPS requirements. Aircraft entering MNPS airspace are required to
      have two Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNS) capable of staying within 12.6 NM of
      cleared track for 95 percent of the flight. Gross navigation errors are those that exceed 24
      NM from track center line. Prior to entering MNPS airspace, both INSs must be fully
 136                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       operational to meet the MNPS requirement of having two fully serviceable LRNSs. In
       order to signify that a flight is approved to operate in NAT MNPS airspace, the letter “X”
       will be inserted within item 10 of the DD1801 flight plan form.
       11.1.1.8. NAT Tracks. Contained within the North Atlantic MNPS airspace is an
       organized track system (NAT Tracks) between FL 285 and FL 420 to optimize air traffic
       flow between the North American and European continents. NAT tracks are designed
       based on meteorological data and are updated twice daily. When flying over the North
       Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT tracks) valid for
       their coast out time from the DoD NOTAM internet site.
       11.1.1.9. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. This airspace
       requires special certification and exists to increase airspace capacity, safely, by reducing
       vertical separation from 2000 ft to 1000 ft between suitably equipped aircraft. RVSM
       has been implemented in the CONUS, Europe, Africa, and Middle East. RVSM airspace
       typically extends from FL 290 through FL 410. Consult AP/1 and AP/2 for locations and
       lateral and vertical dimensions of this airspace.
       11.1.1.10. Mission Planning Environment (MPE). A MAJCOM-certified combination of
       mission planning hardware and software used to load an aircraft data transfer device.
       Only an approved ACC MPE may be used to load HC-130J map cards and mission cards
       (RMMs) for use in flight.
11.2. Mission Planning Procedures.
   11.2.1. Refer to Chapter 6 for general mission planning requirements.
   11.2.2. Mission/Route Planning. Pilots/CSO will normally accomplish and verify mission
   planning while in a flight planning facility/base operations; the data is then loaded manually
   (or via the data transfer card) into the CNI. Pilots/CSO will also calculate and verify the
   required ramp fuel load.
       11.2.2.1. When practical, pilots/CSO will plan the most direct routing possible or utilize
       wind optimized CFP routing to enhance fuel conservation.
       11.2.2.2. Computer Flight Plan (CFP). A CFP generated from PFPS is the preferred
       flight plan for all HC-130J operations. Wind may either be applied automatically via
       Winder (USN METOC) or manually from a DD 175-1, USAF OWS, or AFWA product.
       When paper wind products are used for flight planning, they will be carried in-flight and
       filed with the completed master log and chart for 90 days. When planning CAT I sorties
       crews should obtain wind data for multiple suitable altitudes including 10,000 ft MSL.
       11.2.2.3. Verify the CFP for route definition and accuracy, paying particular attention to
       adherence with over flight clearances.
       11.2.2.4. Refer to Chapter 12 for fuel planning procedures.
   11.2.3. Equal Time Point (ETP) Computations.
       11.2.3.1. The ETP provides crews a tool for recovery airfield decision-making when in-
       flight emergencies occur. ETP computations are required on CAT I routes when the total
       time between the LSAF and FSAF is 5 hours or more. ETPs must be annotated and
       plotted on the MPC and MFP prior to the coast-out waypoint. Squadron-approved
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                              137


      computer programs which use similar algorithms as the manual computation may be
      used. The PFPS Fuel Analysis Tool (FAT) is approved for computing ETPs. Enter ETP
      information into the CNI PROGRESS page during preflight. CNI-computed ETPs only
      become accurate upon reaching the PERF CRUISE altitude. CNI-computed ETPs can be
      obtained for different airspeeds (i.e. 260 KTAS for a 3-engine scenario). CNI-computed
      ETP will not calculate if you do not overfly the programmed coast-out point.
      11.2.3.2. The blocks provided on top of the C130J PFPS CFP should be used to record
      information needed by the CNI to compute an ETP. These blocks and provided formulas
      also serve as a worksheet for crews to do the manual ETP computation. If using the
      computer programs or the CNI, annotate applicable information on the Master Flight Plan
      (MFP). If the CNI is used, annotate “CNI” in the master flight plan blocks for which the
      CNI does not present a number.
      11.2.3.3. In-flight ETP. Manually re-compute the ETP when the actual arrival over any
      reporting point prior to the ETP (as displayed on the printed and winded flight plan)
      exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused by erroneous wind
      information. Acceptable manual calculation methods include the PFPS FAT and any of
      the four ETP Options from Figure 11.1. NOTE: ETP computations are not required
      for maritime search procedures.

Figure 11.1. ETP Calculations.




      11.2.3.4. To compute a manual ETP:
          11.2.3.4.1. Identify and record the LSAF, coast-out point, approximate midpoint of
          the CAT I portion, coast-in point, and FSAF. The coast-out point, approximate
 138                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


          midpoint, and coast-in point are actual waypoints on the flight plan. The coast-out
          point for ETP purposes must occur after initial level-off.
          11.2.3.4.2. Determine and record the distance from the LSAF to the FSAF (entering
          the two airfields and approximate midpoint into PFPS is an easy way to do this).
          11.2.3.4.3. Determine and record the average groundspeed (GS) for the first-half
          (coast-out to midpoint) and second-half (midpoint to coast-in) of the CAT I portion.
          Divide the respective enroute distance by the enroute time to/from the midpoint to
          determine accurate average GS.
          11.2.3.4.4. Calculate a wind factor (WF1 & WF2) for each half by subtracting the
          flight-planned average TAS from the averaged GS. If a tailwind is experienced the
          WF will be positive. If a headwind is experienced the WF will be negative.
          11.2.3.4.5. Use the provided formulas to compute the time it takes to fly from the
          ETP to the FSAF. Use this time and the second-half-averaged GS to calculate a
          distance from the FSAF that the ETP occurs.
TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF-FSAF)
                                 (WF2 – WF1) + 2TAS
DISTANCE (ETP-FSAF) = TIME (ETP-FSAF) * GS (2nd half)


NOTE: The ETP will always occur upwind of the geographic midpoint.
          11.2.3.4.6. The INDEX FROM/TO and PROGRESS pages may also be utilized in-
          flight to update times and distances to diversion bases along the route of flight. An
          accurate GS must be entered in order to obtain correct ETE calculations.
          11.2.3.4.7. Due to the requirement for ETPs to be highly accurate in the case of an
          emergency, it is always advisable for aircrew to double-check both computer and
          manual calculations. Failure to follow this guidance could result in the inability of an
          aircraft to make landfall prior to fuel exhaustion.
11.3. Master Flight Plan and Master Plotting Chart.
   11.3.1. One CFP and one plotting chart will be used as master copies for each flight utilizing
   CAT I procedures. Both will be labeled “MASTER COPY” and will be referred to as Master
   Flight Plan (MFP) and Master Plotting Chart (MPC). Both documents must be retained by
   the unit current operations or designated representative for a period of 90 days following the
   mission.
   11.3.2. MFP Usage. The MFP is normally maintained by the PM or CSO but should be kept
   readily available to all crew members. It will be used to record the following in flight:
       11.3.2.1. All ATC route clearances and changes to clearances.
       11.3.2.2. The wind, temperature, altitude, fuels remaining, and the bearing/range
       between the INAV solutions over waypoints bordering and within CAT I Navigation
       airspace.
       11.3.2.3. Any loss or degraded navigation/avionics equipment.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  139


      11.3.2.4. Compass deviation checks.
      11.3.2.5. Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check.
   11.3.3. MFP Symbology. Use the following symbology to ensure that both pilots can easily
   determine which waypoints have been programmed into the CNI-MU, which programmed
   waypoints have been verified, and which waypoints have been transitioned in-flight. See
   Figure 12.2 for an example MFP.
      11.3.3.1. Place a check-mark next to the waypoint to signify the waypoint has been
      entered into the CNI-MU and the course and distance have been verified.
      11.3.3.2. Circle the check-mark to signify the coordinates, course and distance in the
      CNI-MU have been verified by another crewmember.
      11.3.3.3. Draw one diagonal line through the circled check-mark to signify the waypoint
      has been passed, reported, and all applicable annotations associated with waypoint
      passage have been completed.
      11.3.3.4. Cross the first diagonal line with another to signify that the aircraft‘s position
      has been plotted on the MPC approximately 60 NM (10 to 15 minutes depending on
      groundspeed) after waypoint passage.
   11.3.4. MPC Usage. The use of a plotting chart is required on every route requiring CAT I
   Navigation. Use an appropriate JNC-A, JNC, GNC, or an Oceanic Planning Chart (OPC).
   During mission planning, draw/print the course line representing the planned route of flight
   on the MPC and mark the associated suitable emergency airfields. The PIC will verify this
   information and annotate the chart with his/her signature, date, and mission number/call sign.
   During flight, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on groundspeed) after each CAT I waypoint, the
   CSO/PM will Mark Position and then plot the INS-only position on the MPC (using a dot
   surrounded by a square) and annotate the marked time and position coordinates adjacent to
   the plot. The CSO/PM should compare the plotted point to the course line. This procedure
   confirms that the navigation system is steering the airplane to the correct waypoint.
11.4. Pre-Flight Procedures.
   11.4.1. Pre-flight procedures must include a ZULU time check and resynchronization of the
   aircraft master clock, if necessary. The aircraft master clock will always be set to ZULU
   time. All annotated times will be in ZULU format. Aircraft clock errors resulting in position
   report time errors can lead to an erosion of actual longitudinal separation between aircraft.
   Acceptable time standards that can be used include GPS, Naval Observatory Master Clock
   (DSN 312-762-1401/1069 or 312-560-6742), and WWV (2500, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000
   kHz) via wristwatch or other device.
   11.4.2. Pre-Flight Communications Check. A pre-flight check of the SATCOM and HF
   radios should be made to a suitable agency (operating authority, command post or ATC). At
   least one HF radio must be confirmed operational prior to coast out or the mission must be
   terminated.
   11.4.3. Navigation Initialization and Solutions. Both the AUTONAV and manual GC
   alignment of the INSs result in the required navigation performance needed for RNP RNAV
   operation. The GPS positions may be used as initial positions as long as they agree within
   one-tenth of one minute. If GPS is not available, use precision parking coordinates or, as a
 140                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   last resort, obtain coordinates from an airfield diagram published in an approved instrument
   approach book. This position must be checked and verified by both pilots and recorded on
   the MFP.
   11.4.4. Communication/Navigation/Identification Management System (CNI-MS).            In
   addition to Chapter 6 requirements, when configuring for CAT I operations, both pilots or
   pilot and CSO will verify that the INAV Position Alert 1 is set to 4.0 miles and INAV
   Position Alert 2 is set to 8.0 miles on the CNI PROGRESS page. This will generate an
   INAV POS DIFFERENCE Advisory at 4.0 miles and an INAV POS MISCOMPARE
   Caution at 8.0 miles.
   11.4.5. Loading the Route of Flight. Because CAT I routes usually involve the manual input
   of waypoints not found in the database, and often require aircraft maximum range capability,
   it is critical that both pilots and CSO work in sequence and independently to enter accurate
   route of flight data. It is not sufficient for one crewmember to simply observe another
   crewmember entering the data. The following steps will be completed by the pilots/CSO:
       11.4.5.1. One of the pilots or CSO will:
          11.4.5.1.1. Load the route of flight directly from the filed flight plan, MFP or data
          transfer card into the CNI and verify both the magnetic course and the leg distance for
          each waypoint with the MFP. Loading the route directly from the filed flight plan
          may minimize pilot/controller clearance loop (misinterpretation) errors. Label
          waypoints so they can be readily identified for subsequent position reporting. If the
          courses differ by more than 2° or the distances differ by more than 2 NM, the pilot
          will resolve the discrepancy prior to flight. Completion of this step will be annotated
          with a check-mark next to the waypoint.
          11.4.5.1.2. Using the LEGS pages, insert the forecast winds (if available) at each
          waypoint.
          11.4.5.1.3. Verify the total distance to the destination on the CNI PROGRESS page.
          Any significant disparity (more than 25 NM to allow for SIDs/STARs and
          approaches) in the total distance between the CNI and MFP will require a recheck of
          the ramp position and waypoint coordinates.
       11.4.5.2. Both pilots (or pilot and CSO) will verify the waypoint coordinates and course
       and distance information from the opposite side CNI to the MFP. Completion of this step
       will be annotated with the check-mark being circled on the MFP.
       11.4.5.3. If the planned route of flight is a stored route or one loaded during a data
       transfer, verification of waypoint coordinates must still be accomplished by both pilots
       (or pilot and CSO) in the same manner.
11.5. CAT I Navigation Procedures.
   11.5.1. This section provides general procedures and guidance for the operation of
   navigation systems on CAT I routes. For navigation system requirements, consider all
   oceanic airspace as MNPS airspace. Specific procedures for RNP RNAV airspace are
   addressed in subsequent sections.
   11.5.2. Aircraft is currently not RVSM compliant.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                141


  11.5.3. Navigation System Accuracy Checks.
     11.5.3.1. Ground. After leaving the ramp, perform the INS/INAV groundspeed check by
     stopping the aircraft and checking each pilot‘s groundspeed on the CNI-MUs or
     HDDs/HUDs. Groundspeeds in excess of 1 knot while the aircraft is stationary may
     indicate a faulty INS.
     11.5.3.2. Airborne.   Determine INAV position accuracy by comparing it to enroute
     NAVAIDs.
     11.5.3.3. Compass Deviation Check. Perform a compass deviation check using both
     INSs and the standby compass prior to entering CAT I airspace. Perform subsequent
     checks after heading changes of 30° (or greater) or every 3 hours. Record the deviation
     in the appropriate block of the MFP. Apply this correction to headings to be flown
     whenever it is necessary to use the standby compass as the sole source for navigation.
     11.5.3.4. Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check. Prior to coast-out, evaluate/compare the
     accuracy of all navigation solutions. In the event of discrepancies, greater than 4 NM, the
     crew should investigate the cause and determine if CAT I flight is feasible. Record this
     gross error check in the appropriate block of the MFP. If a pure INS position is
     determined to be more than 4 miles in error, an in-flight alignment (IFA) may be
     accomplished provided sufficient time is available prior to entering RNP RNAV or
     oceanic airspace. If coast-out is made at a radial/DME fix, the appropriate radial should
     be selected on the non-active CDI as a further check that the navigation system is
     tracking to the fix.
  11.5.4. Communications. In addition to guidance in Chapter 6, crews will accomplish the
  following:
     11.5.4.1. Emergency Frequency Monitoring. In the interest of safety during oceanic and
     remote area operations (100 NM offshore), flights should maintain a listening watch on
     121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the VHF common frequency.
     11.5.4.2. BIU Backup. Ensure that a pilot places their transmission switch to an HF
     radio so that the crew can transmit on HF in case of BIU Backup. The other pilot should
     select VHF 2 for the same reason. VHF 1 will be available on the Get Home Control and
     crew can attempt to relay transmissions to other aircraft on 121.5 until within VHF range
     of ATC.
  11.5.5. Oceanic Clearance. If not received before take-off, the oceanic clearance should be
  obtained prior to the boundary of oceanic airspace IAW FLIP.
     11.5.5.1. The PIC will designate the duties of flying the aircraft and copying/monitoring
     clearances so that they are clearly understood by all crewmembers. The PM will
     normally receive and record the oceanic clearance. Both pilots will monitor and
     crosscheck to ensure that it has been copied correctly and clearly understood.
     11.5.5.2. The clearance will be recorded on the MFP, and reviewed by two crew
     members. If the oceanic clearance received is different from the planned clearance, use
     the following procedures:
         11.5.5.2.1. Record the new route on the MFP to include applicable updates to ETP
         data.
142                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         11.5.5.2.2. Enter the new waypoints into the CNI IAW the pre-flight procedures in
         this chapter.
         11.5.5.2.3. Ensure fuel will still be sufficient to arrive at the destination waypoint
         with required reserves.
         11.5.5.2.4. Mark out the old plotted track and draw the revised plot on the MPC.
         11.5.5.2.5. In no case should this process simultaneously engage the attention of both
         pilots during flight.
  11.5.6. Approaching Coast-Out. Prior to coast-out and outside of RNP RNAV airspace it is
  permissible and recommended to use the EGI or GPS (INAV source in AUTO mode) as the
  INAV solution for both CNI-SPs if NAVAIDs are available for monitoring. Prior to losing
  NAVAID reception, the INAV solution that is not the controlling solution must be placed to
  INS. This ensures there is constant comparison of the controlling solution to an independent
  INS solution. Beginning at the coast-out waypoint and continuing through coast-in, CNI-MU
  bearing/range between INAV solutions should be recorded at each waypoint to provide a
  running record of INS drift relative to the controlling solution.
  11.5.7. IFF. Reset Mode 3A code to 2000, 30 minutes after entering Category I airspace.
  11.5.8. MFP and MPC Procedures.
      11.5.8.1. After takeoff, record the takeoff time in the Actual Time of Arrival (ATA)
      block of the departure airfield on the MFP. As soon as practical after takeoff, determine
      a revised Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each line of the MFP using flight-planned
      leg times and the actual departure time.
      11.5.8.2. Prior to waypoint transition, check the MFP magnetic course and distance to
      the next waypoint against the CNI-MU. The courses should be within 2º and the
      distances should agree within approximately 2 NM. Check and verify that the subsequent
      waypoint is properly programmed. Update ETAs to the next two waypoints.
      11.5.8.3. Overhead the waypoint, confirm the ATA and determine the minutes
      ahead/behind by comparing it to the ETA. Record the CNI-MU bearing/range between
      INAV solutions to provide a running record of INS drift relative to the controlling
      solution. Record the actual fuel remaining above the flight-planned continuation fuel and
      write the difference between continuation fuel and actual fuel remaining in the EXCESS
      block of the MPF. See the in-flight fuel management section of Chapter 12 for
      additional guidance and definitions.
      11.5.8.4. Immediately after waypoint passage, and as soon as the aircraft has intercepted
      its new course, confirm that the aircraft is outbound on its flight planned magnetic course
      to the next waypoint and record the bearing/range between INAV solutions found on the
      INAV 1/3 page.
      11.5.8.5. Record the actual in-flight conditions (altitude, wind, and static air temperature
      (SAT)) above the forecast conditions on the next line of the MFP. Update these
      conditions as well as fuel flow as needed on the PERF CRUISE and LEGS pages in the
      CNI-MU.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 143


     11.5.8.6. If required, complete a position report to the controlling agency IAW FIH
     procedures. The layout of the CNI PROGRESS page supports the format of the position
     report; however, ensure that ETAs passed to the controlling agency match the ETAs on
     the MFP. This will enable the pilots to determine if an ETA has changed from what was
     previously reported. If an ETA changes by more than 3 minutes, notify the controlling
     agency.
     11.5.8.7. Draw a diagonal line through the waypoint on the MFP to indicate it has been
     passed, reported, and all applicable annotations associated with waypoint passage have
     been completed.
     11.5.8.8. Approximately 60 nm (10 to 15 minutes depending on groundspeed) after
     waypoint passage, MARK the aircraft position and plot the INS-only position on the
     MPC. Record the mark time and position coordinates next to the plot. If the plotted
     position is not within 2 NM of the course center-line, check waypoint coordinates for
     accuracy, ensure the autopilot is tracking correctly in NAV mode, re-check the accuracy
     of the charted course-line, and re-check that the position was plotted correctly.
     11.5.8.9. Cross the first diagonal on the MFP to indicate that the aircraft position has
     been plotted.
     11.5.8.10. When the frequency of waypoints along CAT I route segments is greater than
     one every thirty minutes, full-line entries and plotting can be limited to a minimum of one
     every hour. Full-line entries with the corresponding position plot are required for every
     waypoint involving a change of heading over 20 degrees.
  11.5.9. Routine Monitoring.
     11.5.9.1. Because of the possibility of the autopilot disconnecting from the
     altitude/steering modes, regular checks of correct engagement with the navigation system
     should be made.
     11.5.9.2. Crews should monitor aircraft performance and outside parameters, suspect
     potential problem areas, and review the performance manual if the following conditions
     are encountered:
         11.5.9.2.1. The fuel remaining is less that the planned continuation fuel.
         11.5.9.2.2. Any Low Calculated Fuel CNI-MU advisory.
         11.5.9.2.3. ATA at any MFP fix is off by more than ± 5 minutes.
         11.5.9.2.4. SAT differs by more than ± 5ºC from flight planned.
         11.5.9.2.5. Actual winds differ by more than 30º or 15 knots from flight-planned.
         11.5.9.2.6. Any Ahead/Behind Time more than 10% of total planned enroute time to
         that point.
         11.5.9.2.7. Hazardous meteorological conditions.
  11.5.10. Approaching Landfall. Use the radar to help identify the coast-in position. When
  the aircraft is approaching the first landfall NAVAID, tune and identify the navigation
  facility and crosscheck the aircraft position. If coast-in is made at a radial/DME fix, the
  appropriate radial should be selected on the non-active CDI as a further check that the
 144                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   navigation system is tracking according to the current clearance. Once NAVAID reception is
   assured and flight is not being conducted in RNP RNAV airspace, all INAV solutions can be
   returned to AUTO. If entering BRNAV airspace, AUTOTUNE the NAVAIDS, select
   INS/RAD as the controlling solution, and place the other INAV solution in AUTO. Revert to
   CAT II procedures. Reset POS ALERT and IFF Mode 3 as appropriate.
11.6. Special Certification Airspace Requirements and Procedures.
   11.6.1. The GPS currently installed in the HC-130J navigation suite does not meet FAA
   certification requirements for IFR navigation. AFI 11-202V3 allows the GPS to be used as a
   mission enhancement system for enroute instrument navigation, if it is used to update a self–
   contained navigation system, such as INS or mission computer, and is checked against other
   approved sources (in this case an RNP-10 certified INS). Therefore, on CAT II routes (not
   including operations in BRNAV airspace), the EGI or GPS can be used as the controlling
   solution for enroute instrument navigation if NAVAIDs are available for monitoring. The
   NAVAIDs must be operational and actively monitored. If deviations are observed, crews
   should revert to navigation via ground based NAVAIDs. For operations over CAT I routes
   (not including operations in RNP-10 airspace), the EGI or GPS can be used as the controlling
   solution providing the pilot can monitor its performance using the offside INS as an
   independent navigation source. The EGI or GPS cannot be used as the controlling solution in
   BRNAV or RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the EGI.
   11.6.2. The HC-130J is certified for RNP-10 and Basic RNAV (BRNAV)/RNP-5 airspace,
   but with operational time restrictions. These certifications are based on raw INS data.
       11.6.2.1. RNP-10 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 10 NM for 95% of the
       flight. The track containment limit is 20 NM. The HC-130J navigation system has been
       certified to meet the requirements of RNP-10 airspace for up to 10.4 hours from the time
       the controlling INS was commanded to the NAV mode. The pure INS solution is the
       only certified navigation solution for flying in this airspace. Annotate the letter “R” in
       Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate
       RNP-10 certification.
          11.6.2.1.1. The clock can be reset for an additional 10.4 hours maximum, following
          an in-flight alignment of an INS. Due to the lack of GPS RAIM, in-flight alignments
          done for the purpose of extending RNP-10 airspace time must be conducted on only
          one INS at a time and within coverage of a NAVAID. Only after verifying the
          aircraft’s position within 0.3 NM of the first alignment, may an in-flight alignment be
          performed on the subsequent INS.
       11.6.2.2. BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 5 NM for 95% of
       the flight. The track containment limit is 10 NM. Minimum equipment to operate in this
       airspace is one INS capable of updates. The INS/RAD or INS-only solution will be the
       controlling INAV solution in this airspace. The INS/RAD solution can be used without
       time restrictions if the solution is being updated from NAVAIDs. If the NAVAIDs
       become unreliable, either through radio failure or denial, the INS-only solution will still
       maintain BRNAV accuracy for 2.6 hours from the time the controlling INS was
       commanded to the NAV mode. If needed, an in-flight alignment may be used to restart
       the time-in-NAV of an INS prior to entry into this airspace. INS/RAD or INS-only
       solution will be selected prior to entering BRNAV airspace. The AUTOTUNE function
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 145


     of the CNI-MS must be enabled. BRNAV airspace currently exists throughout the
     European Region. Because BRNAV airspace exists only where NAVAID reception is
     available, CAT I procedures are not required. Annotate the letter “R” in Block 10 of the
     DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate BRNAV
     certification.
  11.6.3. Note: The HC-130J is currently not certified to operate in RVSM airspace. Reduced
  Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is applied is
  considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type
  must be approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the
  following for RVSM requirements:
     11.6.3.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
     the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
     this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
     11.6.3.2. Have the autopilot engaged during level cruise, except when circumstances
     such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
     11.6.3.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record the
     readings of both altimeters.
     11.6.3.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 ft.
     11.6.3.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 ft per minute when operating near other
     aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
     11.6.3.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
     RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
     11.6.3.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
     equipment.
  11.6.4. North Pacific Region (NOPAC) MNPS airspace. For flights in NOPAC MNPS
  airspace comply with the following additional procedures when transiting the
  Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic Control Area/First-Impressions Report; Flight Information
  Region on the NOPAC North route. The following minimum operable navigation systems
  are mandatory:
     11.6.4.1. Prior to entering the NOPAC North route, the radar and both EGI navigation
     systems must be fully operational.
     11.6.4.2. After entering the NOPAC North route:
         11.6.4.2.1. Aircraft on the NOPAC North route may continue without functional
         radar, if radar is not required for weather avoidance, as long as both EGI systems are
         fully functional to include GPS and INS inputs. If the EGI accuracy cannot be
         determined, either re-file a flight plan on another track (fuel permitting) or return to
         the nearest facility possessing maintenance capability.
         11.6.4.2.2. Aircraft on the NOPAC North route may continue with only one
         functional EGI system, which includes both GPS and INS input, or two functional
         INS provided the radar system is fully functional. Verify in-flight that satisfactory
         RADAR returns are available on all ranges, particularly the 80, 160, and 320 NM
 146                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


          ranges. If the radar system is either marginal or inoperative, fuel permitting, re-file a
          flight plan to another track or return to the nearest facility possessing maintenance
          capability.
          11.6.4.2.3. Aircraft that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 11.6.4.1 or
          11.6.4.2 will return to the nearest maintenance repair facility.
11.7. North Atlantic Tracks (NAT). When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should obtain
a copy of the NAT valid for their coast out time. Until RVSM certification is complete the HC-
130J is not permitted into the NAT system, but can follow track routings below the NAT altitude
structure.
11.8. Navigation Malfunctions and Failures.
   11.8.1. Should INAV solutions noticeably separate and exceed 8 NM, determine and use the
   INS solution considered most accurate by evaluating both INSs using available radio aids,
   ground mapping radar, and GPS. Highest validity should be given to positions referenced via
   radar. Next highest validity should be given to positions derived via radio aid fixing. When
   left to determine most probable position (MPP) via navigation solution comparisons, two
   agreeing INS positions are more valid than two agreeing GPSs; and two agreeing GPSs and
   one agreeing INS indicate a probable INS problem. Consider INS-radar/NAVAID, INS-INS,
   and INS-GPS position comparisons that are less than 4 NM difference to be valid and in
   agreement. Once the most accurate INS is determined, select it as the controlling solution.
   Update ETAs to ATC if required.
   11.8.2. Situations may arise when crews cannot identify the faulty navigation system by
   simple comparison of positions between navigation solutions. Fly the aircraft halfway
   between the disagreeing INS solutions. Plot both CNI-SP solutions at least once every 30
   minutes on the MPC, labeling the pilot CNI-SP navigation solution MPP1 and the copilot‘s
   MPP2. Continue to evaluate outputs from each INS and try to use plotted position
   information to identify adverse trends.
   11.8.3. Malfunctions and failures in MNPS airspace:
       11.8.3.1. After entering MNPS airspace, flight may be continued with a minimum of
       only one functional INS if the opposing EGI system has access to both GPS and INS
       inputs.
       11.8.3.2. Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment that
       reduces the capability to comply with MNPS prior to MNPS entry will return to a
       suitable airfield with a maintenance repair facility.
       11.8.3.3. Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment after entry
       into MNPS airspace should immediately report the malfunction to the controlling agency
       and subsequent agencies throughout the route of flight. Once the aircraft has entered
       oceanic airspace, the PIC should continue to operate the aircraft IAW the Oceanic
       Clearance already received, appreciating that the reliability of the total navigation system
       has been significantly reduced. The PIC should also prepare a proposal to ATC with
       respect to the prevailing circumstances and consult with ATC as to the most suitable
       action.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                           147


     11.8.3.4. If an aircraft in MNPS airspace is unable to continue flight IAW ATC
     clearance for reasons such as severe turbulence, aircraft performance problems, or
     pressurization failure, a revised clearance should be obtained as soon as possible. If
     unable to obtain a new clearance, offset 30 NM from the assigned route by turning 90
     degrees from track and maintain altitude if possible. Once offset 30 NM, climb or
     descend to an altitude which differs from those normally used by 500 ft.
  11.8.4. Malfunctions and failures in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace:
     11.8.4.1. Aircraft unable to maintain RNP-10 or BRNAV RNAV tolerances must advise
     controlling agency immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.

                                           Chapter 12

                                      FUEL PLANNING

12.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist planners and aircrews in fuel planning airland
and airdrop missions, with or without low-level segments. A fuel plan is required for all flights
except local area training flights with established standard fuel loads. The CFPS Computer
Flight Plan (CFP) and T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1-1 Performance Manuals are the primary preflight
references. All preflight planning must be verified with aircraft mission computer (MC)
performance prior to departure. Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to
minimize fuel usage.
12.2. Definitions. The following definitions apply to fuel planning, and take precedence over
similar definitions published elsewhere.
   12.2.1. CAT 1 Route: Any route that does not meet the requirements of a CAT II route,
   including tactical navigation and overwater routes.
   12.2.2. Contingency Fuel: An identified extra to compensate for unforeseen circumstances
   during any phase of flight (i.e. un-forecasted weather, launch delay, etc.)
   12.2.2.1. Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF). Hourly fuel flow from the last applicable cruise leg on
   the CFP.
   12.2.3. Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL):           Minimum fuel required at engine start to
   complete tasked mission.
   12.2.4. Depressurization Fuel: Additional fuel required to protect the aircraft and occupants
   in the event of a cabin depressurization followed by an extended diversion to an alternate
   airport at low altitude where fuel consumption is increased.
   12.2.5. Tankered Fuel: Additional fuel carried through a primary destination for use on a
   subsequent leg.
   12.2.6. Wing Relieving Fuel: Additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter
   wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations.
12.3. Alternate Selection. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or 11-2HC-
130JV3 VOL 3 require the filing of an alternate.
   12.3.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting mission
   requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-202V3
   weather criteria.
   12.3.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting AFI 11-
   202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
   12.3.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred.
12.4. Fuel Planning Profiles. Divert profiles should be fully fuel planned and represent what
will actually be flown. Altitudes should be no higher than the ATC cruise ceiling per the
performance manual. For fuel analysis, use Table 12.1, Fuel Load Components with the
C130JHI.frm PFPS form (non-air refueled) or AF Form 4139 (if receiver air refueled). The PFPS
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      149


Fuel Analysis Tool can directly read the CFPS route and print a completed copy of AF Form
4139.
   12.4.1. Computer Flight Plans. Print the CFPS route using the C130JHI.frm form. If a
   destination alternate or an air refueling abort base is required, use the Turnpoint/Additional
   Points tool to insert the designated airfield as a DVT (divert) type after the intended landing
   airfield.
12.4.2. Computer Fuel Plans. Forms printed from the certified ACC MPE are authorized.
Computed data will match aircraft type, configuration, requirements and limitations for the
mission to be flown. The C-130J Flight Performance Module (FPM) of PFPS is certified to
calculate accurate fuel planning information for the HC-130J. Crews should use CFPS System
Admin to verify the FPM version with TO 1C-130J-1-1 and note any differences.
12.4.2.1. CFPS CFP Planning Profile. The C130JHI.frm form permits both the route of flight
and fuel planning information to be recorded. Use the fuel planning blocks on the top of the
flight plan and Table 12.1 for fuel planning. Enroute and Minimum Landing Fuel will be
automatically printed. Planners will ensure an accurate Recovery Fuel is input on the CFPS
Premission/Configuration/Fuel screen so calculated Continuation Fuels used during in-flight fuel
monitoring are valid. When alternates are required, planners may need to accomplish and print
two iterations of the flight plan to incorporate an accurate Recovery Fuel. For example: After
the first calculation, extract the enroute fuel to the alternate from the last line of the flight plan
and add this to the initial Recovery Fuel. A second flight plan will be calculated once the
Premission/Configuration/Fuel screen is updated with the correct Recovery Fuel. If an alternate
is required, use the Turnpoint/Additional Points screen to insert the designated airfield as a DVT
(divert) type after the intended landing airfield. See Figure 12.2 for a sample of a completed
CFPS CFP and Figure 12.3 for a sample of a completed fuel planning worksheet.
12.4.2.2. Continuation Fuel for each leg will be calculated using the following
formula:Continuation Fuel = Fuel Remaining (beginning of leg) – Landing Fuel + Recovery
Fuel
   12.4.3. Non-Air Refueled Planning . En route cruise airspeed normally should be planned at
   a constant TAS. Use the fuel planning blocks at the top of the printed C130JHI flight plan
   form with Table 12.1 for fuel analysis. En Route and Minimum Landing Fuel are
   automatically printed.
   12.4.4. Air Refueled Planning. Use AF Form 4139 in place of the fuel planning blocks at the
   top of C130JHI.frm. The AF Form 4139 is applicable to both single and multiple tanker air
   refueled planning. The PFPS Fuel Analysis Tool can be used to produce a computerized
   version of this form directly from the CFPS route. The computerized version of the form is
   valid for up to four receiver air refuelings. All items are self-explanatory except as noted
   below. Items common to all sections: Item A, OPERATING WEIGHT on the manual form
   is the basic aircraft operating weight plus the cargo/pax weight. The computerized version of
   the form has separate blocks for the two items.

      12.4.4.1. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA. Must not be negative. If necessary, add fuel to the
      Planned Ramp Fuel (item B) or the Planned Onload (items C, D, E, or F). Alternatively,
      move the air refueling track or add another air refueling.
      12.4.4.2. GROSS WT. Not required.
      12.4.4.3. TEMP DEV. Not required.
      12.4.4.4. TAKEOFF TO EAR 1 Section:
      12.4.4.5. ENROUTE (Item 1). CFPS Clock Time and Total Fuel at EAR 1 (prior to
      onload), minus STTO fuel from line 1. Subtract the helicopter/tiltrotor refueling offload
      (if any) from Fuel and add it to Item 3, Identified Extra. The PFPS Fuel Analysis Tool
      performs this correction automatically.
      12.4.4.6. IDENTIFIED EXTRA (Item 3). Include 1000 pounds per hour for the time
      anticipated at lower altitude on the track prior to and during actual air refueling. Do not
      enter if the CFP takes into account the altitude change for the refueling.
      12.4.4.7. RESERVE (Item 5). Ten percent of the Category I time from takeoff to end air
      refueling, not to exceed +45 minutes. Compute at TFF.
      12.4.4.8. FUEL AT EAR #1 (No Onload) (B-6) (Item 7). Planned Ramp Fuel (item B)
      minus Total (item 6). This is the fuel remaining at EAR 1 prior to onload.
      12.4.4.9. PLANNED EAR #1 FUEL (Item 8). Planned fuel at EAR 1 including the fuel
      onload.
      12.4.4.10. EAR 1 TO AR 1 ABORT BASE:
         12.4.4.10.1. This section accounts for an unsuccessful fuel transfer. Plan an abort
         base for all receiver air refueling operations. The departure base may be used. The
         designated abort base must meet alternate airfield weather requirements.
      12.4.4.11. EN ROUTE (Item 9). CFPS DVT time from the EAR to the abort base.
      12.4.4.12. RESERVE (Item 10). Ten percent of the DVT time from EAR to abort base.
      The combined total for item 5 plus item 10 must not exceed +45 minutes. If the combined
      total exceeds +45, reduce Item 10 to bring the total down to +45. Entry is only required
      when the flight time from the EAR to the abort base exceeds 1+30. Compute at TFF.
      12.4.4.13. AAR #1 ABORT ALTERNATE (Item 11). Optional entry.
      12.4.4.14. HOLDING (Item 12). Use 3000 pounds if the AR abort base is in Alaska or at
      latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S.
      12.4.4.15. PLANNED RAMP FUEL (Item 16). Must be greater than Item 17, Required
      Ramp Fuel.
      12.4.4.16. REQUIRED RAMP FUEL (Item 17). Sum of the totals in Items 6 and 15.
      This is the fuel required to fly from departure to the end air refueling point and then
      continue to the abort base with required reserves if the transfer is unsuccessful.
      12.4.4.17. EAR 1 TO EAR 2 Section. Not applicable to single air refueling planning.
      The computerized AF Form 4139 also supports EARs 3 and 4 using procedures identical
      to this section. Items in this segment are identical to the TAKEOFF TO EAR 1 section,
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                151


       but the ENROUTE TIME and FUEL values are the differences in CFPS Clock Time and
       Total Fuel between the next EAR (prior to onload) and the previous EAR (after onload).
       12.4.4.18. EAR TO DESTINATION Section: Items separated by a diagonal ( / ) are
       applicable to both single and multiple air refueling missions. Use the item letter or
       number that corresponds to the final refueling.
       12.4.4.19. EN ROUTE (Item 38). The differences in CFPS Clock Time and Total Fuel
       between destination/IAF and the final EAR line after onload.
       12.4.4.20. RESERVE (Item 39). Ten percent of the Category I time from EAR to
       destination/IAF, not to exceed +45. Compute at TFF.
       12.4.4.21. HOLDING (Item 41). Use 3000 pounds if abort base is in Alaska or at
       latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S.
       12.4.4.22. REQUIRED EAR TO DEST (Item 44). This is the fuel required at the final
       EAR to arrive at the destination/IAF with required reserves.
   12.4.5. HC-130J CNI-MS Profile. The HC-130J CNI-MS plans a complete climb, cruise,
   descent, approach and landing profile based on the inserted LEGS DATA and PERF CLIMB,
   CRUISE, and DESCENT factors. Accurate leg fuels, as calculated by the CNI-MS, are
   dependent on crews ensuring that airspeed, altitude, winds, temperature, and fuel flow are
   correctly represented for each leg of the route and updated/corrected as in-flight conditions
   change. Because the flight profile is more than a planning tool, use good judgment when
   inputting forecast/planned information versus actual performance and conditions. During
   preflight and at each waypoint, the Fuel On Board (FOB) for remaining legs will be
   compared against the flight planned Continuation Fuel to ensure there is sufficient fuel to
   continue the mission as planned in order to meet or exceed destination fuel requirements.
   Once airborne, the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page is calculated (not sensed) using
   sensed Fuel Flow versus Time. Update the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page to the
   amount indicated by the totalizer only when the totalizer amount is less than the calculated
   FOB. Use the most conservative of the FOB or totalizer readings when recording fuel
   remaining during in-flight fuel monitoring. The CNI-MS will provide a FUEL QTY ERROR
   advisory when the PERF INIT WEIGHT FOB and totalizer readings differ by more than
   2500 lbs for more than 10 minutes. Set the FIXED reserve fuel on PERF INIT WEIGHT to
   the Recovery Fuel value. Set the +EXTRA reserve fuel on PERF INIT WEIGHT to the
   Unidentified Extra fuel value. The CNI-MS will then alert the crew to a deteriorating fuel
   situation by generating two Low Calculated Fuel advisories: one when the Unidentified Extra
   fuel is burnt and a second one when the Recovery Fuel is burnt. Destination and Alternate
   Landing Fuel can be obtained from the CNI-MS. Flight crews will use the CNI-MS to
   evaluate and verify destination landing fuel status after mission changes and reroutes and
   whenever a divert is required and/or extensive weather avoidance routing is required.
12.5. Fuel Analysis. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight
and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize
flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent
 152                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Due to the
dynamic nature of CSAR, fuel optimization may not always be possible due to airborne alert
status, unknown orbit times, and TEXACO procedures. Alert fuel loads should be carefully
considered to plan for these circumstances while practicing good fuel management. Aircrew
should employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight
safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment:
   12.5.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required.)
   12.5.2. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. Use
   3000 lbs for holding fuel in this case.
   12.5.3. For all missions, calculate an additional 15 minutes of contingency fuel.
   Contingency fuel should not be considered reserve fuel since crews may burn some or all of
   their contingency fuel. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial required ramp fuel
   load (RRFL.)
   12.5.4. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates providing
   maximum endurance at 10,000 ft MSL. When computing reserve and contingency fuel for
   remote destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 ft MSL.
   12.5.5. Calculate CAT 1 fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the CAT 1 route/route
   segment, not to exceed +45 minutes of fuel at TFF.
   12.5.6. Thunderstorm forecasts will be based on the DD Form 175-1 or equivalent. Where
   weather forecast conditions dictate, add the following fuel corrections to Identified Extra:
       12.5.6.1. 1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions.
       12.5.6.2. 1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of
       flight.
   12.5.7. Approach fuel is 700 lbs, not required for a planned enroute descent.
   12.5.8. Minimum landing fuel is 3,000 lbs. This fuel accounts for gauge errors. Do not
   include this 3,000 lbs of fuel in the 45-minute fuel reserve and 15 minute contingency fuel
   calculations.
   12.5.9. Using all available planning tools and guidance in this chapter, PICs will determine
   the RRFL. In all cases, the PIC is the final authority for determining the actual fuel required
   for a mission.
   12.5.10. Wing Relieving Fuel.
       12.5.10.1. Calculate Wing Relieving Fuel using the flight manual weight limitations
       chart for the aircraft‘s planned cargo load. Enter the chart with the aircraft empty weight
       and cargo weight, then read across to determine the fuel required to remain within limits.
       Add enough Wing Relieving Fuel, if required, to ensure that Recovery Fuel does not fall
       below the fuel required to remain within limits.
       12.5.10.2. All local and JA/ATT missions flying low-level will initially takeoff with
       main tanks full to reduce the effects of wing upbending and increase the center wingbox
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 153


       service life. Decreased takeoff fuel in the main tanks can decrease the center wingbox
       service life as much as 47 percent.
   12.5.11. Optimize Fuel Loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel.
   Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft.
   12.5.12. Minimize use of APUs. Use ground power units when practical.
   12.5.13. Delay engine start time. Units should establish and implement local engines start
   time standards.
   12.5.14. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment
   not necessary to accomplish the mission.
   12.5.15. Establish C2 and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification of
   mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time.
12.6. Depressurization Fuel. Pressurization Loss fuel is applicable when carrying passengers
and oxygen is not available to them. Compute at 1,000 lbs/hr for the ETP “T” time.
12.7. In-Flight Fuel Management. For a flight plan and corresponding fuel log to be most
meaningful for in-flight fuel monitoring, the actual cruise altitude should be no lower than 2000
ft below planned altitude and the airspeed no lower than planned airspeed –10 KTAS or higher
than planned airspeed + 10 KTAS. If initial cruise conditions do not fall within these
parameters, the PIC should strive to reach (or beat) them as soon as possible.
   12.7.1. Monitor fuel consumption by comparing the FOB to predicted Fuel Remaining and
   the required Continuation Fuel on the flight plan. At a minimum, consumption comparisons
   will be accomplished and recorded on the Master Flight Plan (MFP):
       12.7.1.1. As soon as practical after initial level off.
       12.7.1.2. At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 1 hour.
       12.7.1.3. At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 30 minutes if aircraft
       performance is critical or marginal (actual fuel is less than Continuation Fuel, icing
       conditions, weather avoidance, etc.)
       12.7.1.4. Any time re-routing occurs or a lower altitude than what was flight-planned is
       required to be flown.
       12.7.1.5. After onload or offload is complete for air-to-air refueling missions.
   12.7.2. When proceeding to an air refueling abort base after aborting an air refueling onload,
   compute the Recovery Fuel based on required reserves at the abort base. Reset FIXED on
   PERF INIT WEIGHT to match the new Recovery Fuel. Use the CNI-MS to monitor fuel
   consumption as for non-air refueled missions.
   12.7.3. Inflight fuel management may be discontinued at the discretion of the PIC when
   ALL of the following conditions have been met:
       12.7.3.1. The Equal Time Point (ETP) has been crossed (CAT I routes.)
       12.7.3.2. Fuel systems and quantity indicators are functioning normally.
       12.7.3.3. There is obvious extra fuel and the +EXCESS fuel trend is favorable.
154                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


  12.7.4. On CAT I routes, prior to the ETP, if the EXCESS fuel becomes negative the PIC
  will consider and accomplish one of the following recommended actions:
      12.7.4.1. Change the flight profile to ensure planned performance is reacquired and Fuel
      Reserves at destination will be met or exceeded.
      12.7.4.2. Continue and land short of the intended destination (i.e., First Suitable Airfield
      (FSAF)) or proceed to intended destination based on an updated weather forecast that no
      longer requires an alternate.
      12.7.4.3. Return to the departure base or the Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF).
  12.7.5. Flight Plan Changes and Diversion. When mission requirements or ATC dictate a
  change to the planned mission or route, the fuel must be recalculated to ensure safe
  completion of the flight. It is not practical to complete a new PFPS flight plan and fuel log,
  so the CNI-MS is the primary method of deciding if a mission change or reroute can be
  accommodated.
      12.7.5.1. For an unplanned or directed enroute divert, the FROM/TO page, with an
      associated cruise ground speed, can be used to determine an Estimated Time Enroute
      (ETE). Using a 4000 lbs/hr fuel burn, crews should be able to decide if the new routing
      is achievable without adverse effects on destination fuel. Do not accept a reroute that
      adversely depletes the destination Reserve Fuel as prescribed in this chapter.
      12.7.5.2. If the enroute change does not affect the intended destination, then in-flight fuel
      monitoring will consist of comparing the CNI-MS predicted Remaining Fuel with Flight
      Plan Continuation Fuel at the next point common to the reroute and the original flight
      plan. After any route alteration, crews should actively monitor fuel state by recording the
      Fuel Remaining values at abeam positions of the original flight plan and using the
      “Abeam” function of the INDEX/FIX INFO PAGE to crosscheck fuel status.
  12.7.6. Declare “Emergency Fuel” when it is determined that the aircraft will land with less
  than 3000 lbs. Declare “Minimum Fuel” to ATC when it is determined that the aircraft will
  land with less than 3000 lbs plus the Required Reserve.          NOTE: According to the
  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) Pilot/Controller Glossary, “Minimum Fuel
  indicates that an aircraft’s fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching the
  destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely
  indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.” Furthermore the
  AIM states that “a minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for traffic priority. If the
  remaining useable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing,
  you should declare an emergency due to low fuel and report fuel remaining in minutes.”
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                155


Table 12.1. Fuel Load Components.
                                  FUEL PLANNING
EN ROUTE               Fuel required from takeoff through landing at the intended
                       destination. Components include climb, cruise, and approach fuel.
                       Enroute fuel will be obtained from the CFPS CFP or the Fuel
                       Analysis Tool. For planned enroute descent to destination or alternate,
                       use a CFPS Approach leg (“AP” point type) with Fuel set to 700 lbs.
                       CFPS uses this fuel for the entire distance of the Approach leg.

                       For air refueled missions, En Route is the fuel (excluding onload)
                       required from takeoff through the first EAR, or between EARs, or from
                       the final EAR through destination IAF or landing.
STTO                   Fuel required for engine start, taxi, and takeoff. Normally 800 lbs.
                       For known taxi delays or additional engine running ground time in
                       excess of 30 minutes, add 30 lbs/min.
CAT I RESERVE          Fuel for 10% of enroute time along a CAT I route/segment, not to
                       exceed +45 minutes of flight time. Compute at TFF.
ALTERNATE              Fuel required from intended destination to alternate, or most distant
                       alternate when two are required. Flown at optimum cruise altitude,
                       using direct routing to the alternate at LRC airspeed. Fuel for a
                       missed approach (2000 lbs) and second approach at the alternate
                       airfield is required when the visibility-only weather criteria is used to
                       determine the suitability of the original destination.
REQUIRED               45 minute reserve, using maximum endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft
RESERVE                MSL (20,000 ft remote fields.) Required overhead destination or
                       alternate (if alternate is needed.)
CONTINGENCY            15 minutes, using max endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft MSL (20,000
FUEL                   ft MSL for remote fields.)
HOLDING FUEL           Use 3000 lbs when the alternate or AR abort base is located in
                       Alaska, or is located at latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S.
MINIMUM LANDING        3000 lbs (Required.) If it is determined that the aircraft will land with
FUEL                   less than this amount, a fuel emergency exists and ATC must be
                       informed. This entry is separate from required reserve and
                       contingency fuel.
RECOVERY FUEL          Sum of MINIMUM LANDING FUEL, HOLDING FUEL, and
                       ALTERNATE or AAR ABORT FUEL (if required). Also add any
                       applicable Identified Extra categories, e.g. fuel for icing between the
                       destination and alternate or AAR abort base. Used to calculate accurate
                       Continuation Fuels for each leg; it must be updated in the Premission
                       Configuration screen of CFPS.
CONTINUATION           Fuel required at the beginning of each leg to be able to proceed to the
FUEL                   intended destination and land with the required Recovery Fuel.

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

13.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other readily available publications.
13.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
13.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Aircrews are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
not available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home
station MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedure.
   13.3.1. At enroute stations, LMs are authorized to clear Red X symbols for: intake and
   exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels removed and
   installed to facilitate other maintenance when qualified maintenance personnel are not
   available.
   13.3.2. In-Process Inspections. LMs must be aware of their responsibility to perform in-
   process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. During the assembly where further
   assembly will prevent the required inspection of the item, an in-process inspection will be
   performed. The inspection will be documented IAW TO 00-20-1.
13.4. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in TO 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the
CSO/LM will assist the PIC in maintaining the AFTO Form 781. Verify the exceptional release
is signed before flight and resigned, if necessary, at enroute stops.
   13.4.1. After each flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, and flight
   duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO 781H. Review all AFTO 781A discrepancies
   to ensure symbols, date discovered, and clear, detailed entries were entered and the
   discovered by blocks are completed for each discrepancy.
   13.4.2. IAW ACCGM 10-1, DoD Manual 4140.25M Vol II, DoD Management of Bulk

13.5. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Aircrews are normally not required to
service the aircraft; however, they are qualified and authorized to perform those aircrew
maintenance support tasks found in this volume. The aircrew performs these tasks only in the
absence of qualified maintenance personnel and is designed for support of the aircraft and its
mission while away from home station. Without exception, the applicable checklists/job guides
will be used during all refueling and defueling operations.
   13.5.1. Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Servicing. Under no conditions are crewmembers allowed to
   service liquid oxygen.
   13.5.2. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties IAW this chapter. Crew chiefs should be scheduled on those missions where
   a need is anticipated. Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when maintenance support
   is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. Aircrew members may augment
   maintenance refueling teams at enroute stops. Crewmembers may perform refueling duties
   at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.
       13.5.2.1. Crewmembers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will comply
       with T.O. 00-25-172 and refueling job guides.
   13.5.3. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and chief servicing supervisor (CSS) shall
   ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent servicing (CS) in
   accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews performing Dash-1
   preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have cooperation and
   close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous intercom contact with
   fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation. When the aircrew is at the
   aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft operations and shall inform the CSS
   how aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/safety. In keeping with the
   guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CS operations to include
   personnel participating in the refuel.
       13.5.3.1. Use the following guidelines when CS operations are conducted with
       passengers on board:
          13.5.3.1.1. A current and qualified crew member will be designated the passenger
          compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor passengers during CS.
          PCMs will not perform other duties during servicing.
          13.5.3.1.2. The AC shall designate a current and qualified crew member to remain on
          the flight deck to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request for
          emergency assistance on a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to
          an emergency response team. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in
          an emergency.
          13.5.3.1.3. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions,
          and hazards. Passengers will remain seated but will not wear seat belts during CS.
          Passengers shall turn off all portable electronic devices, except medically required
          devices, prior to servicing.
          13.5.3.1.4. Passengers shall not board/exit the aircraft during servicing.
          13.5.3.1.5. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   161


           13.5.3.1.6. Passenger representatives will assist the PCM when passengers board and
           exit. Passengers must remain outside the vapor hazard area, the fuel servicing safety
           zone, oxygen servicing area, and 25 feet from fuel vents during servicing.
           13.5.3.1.7. The AC, or designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs
           when to evacuate passengers.
           13.5.3.1.8. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the crew entrance door and left
           paratroop door should remain open and the right paratroop door should remain closed
           and locked during concurrent servicing. The PCM may lower, but not lock, the left
           paratroop door during inclement weather.
           13.5.3.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
           combat environment.
           13.5.3.1.10. The loadmaster shall ensure cargo loading or unloading does not
           jeopardize passenger safety. Winching is prohibited. Do not load/unload cargo
           containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during CS.
       13.5.3.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
13.6. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
conducted by crews that have been properly trained and certified. See Chapter 16G and AFTTP
3-3.HC-13
13.7. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP). FARP operations will only be performed at
approved sites by crews that have been properly trained and certified. See Chapter 16G and
AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
13.8. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs will not
normally be accomplished. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for
maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
   13.8.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and preparations
   for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to: intake/exhaust inspections,
   access panel security servicing, and AFTO Forms 781 documentation.
   13.8.2. Use the pilot and LM checklists. Begin with the POWER UP checklist, and
   complete all appropriate checklists through the BEFORE LEAVING AIRPLANE checklist.
   Only deviate from the flight crew checklist when maintenance requires less than four engines
   to be started.
   13.8.3. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are required.
   13.8.4. The cargo ramp and door will be closed for all engine run-up’s above flight idle.
13.9. Towing. Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations. The PIC
will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to ensure the towing
supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the PIC must have approval from
the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The PIC will ensure the tow team
supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will
be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the
operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located.
 162                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


Under no circumstances will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor.             CAUTION:
Aircraft damage may occur if the improper tow bar is used.
13.10. Adverse Weather. When thunderstorms are reported within 10 NM of the airfield, only
operations leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue. However,
personnel must be prepared to cease all activities in the event lightning within 5 NM is declared.
When advised of lightning within 5 NM of the airfield, all flight line activities will cease and
personnel will seek shelter.
   13.10.1. Aircraft taxiing to parking or hot cargo when lightning is declared within 5 NM
   should not expect a marshaller. The aircrew will hold in place or proceed to parking if
   clearance is assured. Remain in the aircraft if ground transportation cannot be arranged.
   Time permitting, coordinate with Base Operations if the aircraft will be parked in a location
   other than the one assigned.
13.11. Hostile Environment Operations. Remove all non-essential equipment from the
aircraft prior to a combat mission.
13.12. Hostile Environment Repair Procedures (HERP). Reserved for future use.
13.13. Hostile Environment Repair Kit. Reserved for future use.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 163


                                           Chapter 14

                CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

14.1. General. The loadmaster (LM) coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal
operations or shipping agencies; plans loads; supervises loading, tie-down, and offloading
operations; performs preflight and postflight of aircraft and systems; computes aircraft weight
and balance; provides for the safety and comfort of passengers/troops and security of cargo
during flight; prepares and rigs equipment for airdrop; participates in the aerial delivery of
equipment, supplies, and personnel. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other
applicable technical orders, tactical manuals, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other
mission-related duties as necessary.
   14.1.1. Multiple LM CRM. To ensure good CRM, the primary LM will assume overall
   responsibility for completion of all checklists and ensure no confusion exists about what
   duties have been or need to be accomplished.
14.2. Aircraft Loading Responsibilities.
   14.2.1. The LM is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning, certifying load plans,
   operating aircraft equipment, supervising and directing loading and offloading operations,
   and cargo tie down. He or she is also responsible for entering weight and balance data into
   the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form
   365-4 Form-F. This can either be accomplished manually or electronically using the AFF
   program and a printer. The LM coordinates with the loading crew supervisor to verify cargo
   against manifests, supervises loading operations, and is responsible for safe movement of
   cargo into and out of the aircraft. The LM will notify the PIC, command post, or the terminal
   operations officer if loading personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft
   structure is damaged during loading or offloading. The LM will brief the PIC on any
   hazardous cargo and cargo jettison ability prior to engine start.
   14.2.2. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft LM and
   loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it will compromise
   flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders or USAF
   publications. The aircraft LM may also deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of onload or
   offload of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration.
   14.2.3. The LM is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for airlift.
   Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the LM to use
   their best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge, to determine the best and
   safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they should seek advice of other
   personnel (i.e. available LMs and squadron, group, wing, or MAJCOM standardization
   personnel.)
   14.2.4. At locations without air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes the
   responsibility for ensuring cargo is properly weighed, marked and is accompanied by the
   correct documentation.
   14.2.5. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
   airlift mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the LM can accept DD
 164                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being
   offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and
   transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the TO 1C-130(H)J-
   9CL-1. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials.
   This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
14.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Safety aisles will be maintained IAW 11-2HC-
130JV3, Addenda A, and this chapter.
   14.3.1. When passengers are seated in side facing seats, the LM will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit passenger leg room. NOTE: All
   passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
   safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will be stowed
   with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   14.3.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit will be available for each 20
   passengers/troops. (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape
   hatches are available for egress.) Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not
   considered an obstruction.
   14.3.3. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
   palletized netted cargo or cargo secured with straps. When the cargo, either palletized or
   non-palletized, is secured with chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION:
   Maintain 30 inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying occupied litters.
14.4. Channel Cargo.
   14.4.1. ACC aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo; however, if so tasked, contact the
   air terminal operations center (ATOC), airlift control element (ALCE), or air
   freight/passenger service to obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning
   of proposed load. If required, security requirements for the cargo/passengers being carried
   will be briefed to the LM during the initial load briefing at ATOC. At stations where aircraft
   tie-down equipment is exchanged, make every effort to ensure that a one-for-one exchange
   occurs. If this is not possible, the LM will inform the PIC of lost or missing equipment and
   annotate missing items on the aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, refer to AFTO Form
   781.
14.5. Passenger Handling.
   14.5.1. ACC aircraft will not normally be tasked to support AMC passenger missions, nor
   will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard ACC aircraft without the prior approval of
   the PIC, or mission commander.
   14.5.2. Prior to releasing seats, ensure terminal operations passenger handling personnel are
   aware that passenger comfort latrine facilities are extremely limited, and of the possibility of
   an in-flight diversion.
   14.5.3. Pre-flight Procedures.
       14.5.3.1. The PIC and LM are responsible to ensure all passengers are properly
       manifested.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  165


           14.5.3.1.1. Aircrew will manifest all passengers using DD Form 2131, Passenger
           Manifest, and leave a copy of the manifest with the flight plan. If not filed with the
           flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-
           202V3.
           14.5.3.1.2. Aircrew will accomplish anti-hijacking requirements for passengers IAW
           AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), and this
           publication.
       14.5.3.2. Ensure the APU is shutdown before boarding passengers unless adequate ear
       protection is provided. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated
       next to emergency exits. Do not seat mothers with infants, children under 15 years old or
       physically challenged persons in seats adjacent to emergency exits. Make every effort to
       seat families together.
       14.5.3.3. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
       has the option to either hold the child or place him or her in a Department of
       Transportation-approved infant car seat (ICS). Although the use of an ICS for children is
       no longer mandatory, all passengers (duty and space A), regardless of age, are required to
       be assigned their own seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a
       dedicated seat allowing the use of an ICS at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors current
       FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses
       and child vest restraints.
   14.5.4. In-Flight Procedures.
       14.5.4.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
       judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
       one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
       concern for their safety, passengers will not be allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
       baggage.
       14.5.4.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
           14.5.4.2.1. Cabin temperature.
           14.5.4.2.2. Passengers with small children.
           14.5.4.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
       14.5.4.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will
       not be permitted access to checked baggage.
       14.5.4.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
       make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
       14.5.4.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
       judgment when requesting this authority.
       14.5.4.6. Ensure that classified equipment remains covered during the entire mission
       when passengers are onboard and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment.
14.6. Passenger Restrictions. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes
criteria for passenger movement on DoD aircraft. It defines five categories of passenger travel:
 166                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


space-available, aeromedical evacuation (AE), orientation, public affairs, and space-required.
AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, provides further guidance on orientation and public affairs
travel. Refer to these publications directly for details not addressed in this instruction. In all
cases, passengers will be manifested on a DD Form 2131.            NOTE: See AFI 11-401 as
supplemented for MEP policy.
   14.6.1. Space-available. Authorized passengers, processed through the passenger terminal,
   may occupy surplus seats on DoD aircraft after all space-required passengers have been
   accommodated. Required documentation is listed in DOD 4515.13-R. OG/CCs or
   COMAFFOR may approve space-available travel on aircraft after careful consideration of
   mission requirements and sensitivities.
       14.6.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified. OG/CCs or COMAFFOR
       may approve HAAR on a case-by-case basis. All other mission events and simulated EPs
       are prohibited.
   14.6.2. AE. Defined as the movement of patients by air. Specific guidance on eligibility
   and documentation is contained in DoD 4515.13-R. Commander, USTRANSCOM is the
   single manager for policy and procedure.
       14.6.2.1. Restrictions. If tasked to conduct AE, both pilots must be fully qualified.
       HAAR may be performed if required for mission accomplishment after coordination with
       tasking authority. All other mission events and simulated EPs are prohibited.
   14.6.3. Orientation. There are four categories of orientation flight (refer to AFI 11-401):
   incentive flights, distinguished visitor (DV) flights, familiarization flights, and spouse
   orientation flights. Document authorization requests by letter and DD Form 2131. Requests
   for approval will include the mission profile and events to be accomplished.
       14.6.3.1. Restrictions:
           14.6.3.1.1. Spouse Orientation Flights. Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-401 and
           the MAJCOM Supplement. Additionally, AAR, HAAR, and threat maneuvers are
           prohibited.
           14.6.3.1.2. All Other Orientation Categories. Both pilots must be fully qualified.
           OG/CCs or COMAFFOR may approve all mission events on a case-by-case basis.
           Simulated EPs are prohibited. Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during
           threat maneuvers.
   14.6.4. Public Affairs Travel. Defined as travel in the interest of adding to public
   understanding of DoD activities. AFI 11-401 contains specific details on the Air Force
   Public Affairs Flight Program. Document authorization by letter and manifest on DD Form
   2131. Requests for approval will include the mission profile and events to be accomplished.
   Forward requests through public affairs channels.
       14.6.4.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified. OG/CCs or COMAFFOR
       may approve all mission events on a case-by-case basis. Simulated EPs are prohibited.
       Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers.
   14.6.5. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers who are
   authorized official travel on DoD aircraft. Apply the space-available processing, approval,
   and restrictions to all space-required categories with the following exceptions:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  167


       14.6.5.1. Supported Forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
       instruction as US and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the mission
       being performed. Approval is assumed by the mission tasking. Manifest on DD Form
       2131.
          14.6.5.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified (unless excepted by AFI
          11-401.) Simulated EPs are prohibited. There are no restrictions on mission events.
          Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers. The PIC will
          ensure supported forces are briefed on the mission profile and events prior to flight.
   14.6.6. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
   contained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented. The PIC will verify personnel traveling in this
   status are properly authorized.
       14.6.6.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified (unless excepted by AFI 11-
       401.) Simulated EPs are prohibited (unless required for the purposes of a functional
       check flight (FCF.)) Limit personnel to the absolute minimum required.) There are no
       restrictions on mission events. Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat
       maneuvers. The PIC will ensure MEPs are briefed on the mission profile and events
       prior to flight.
14.7. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance according to T.O. 1-1B-50, Weight
and Balance, T.O. 1C-130(H)J-5-1, Sample Basic Weight Checklist, T.O. 1C-130(H)J-5-2,
Loading Data Manual, and 11-2HC-130J V3 VOL 3, Addenda A, HC-130J
Configuration/Mission Planning. The unit possessing the airplane maintains the primary weight
and balance handbook containing the current airplane status and provides a supplemental weight
and balance handbook for each airplane. Enclose the supplemental handbook in a wear-resistant
binder (preferably metal), stenciled "Weight and Balance" with the airplane model and complete
serial number on the cover or spine.
   14.7.1. The supplemental handbook will include T.O. 1C-130(H)J-5-1, T.O. 1C-130(H)J-5-
   2, and the 11-2HC-130J V3, Addenda A, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4, Weight and
   Balance Clearance Form F –Transport/Tactical, to complete the mission and a certified
   copy of the current DD Form 365-3, Chart C-Basic Weight and Balance Record. The Chart
   C will include the airplane's basic weight, basic moment, and center of gravity.
   14.7.2. Compute weight and balance either using the Chart E mathematical (moments)
   method or approved Automated Form F (AFF) software. Compute DD Form 365-4 IAW this
   AFI’s applicable addenda
       14.7.2.1. Presently AFF software does not accommodate the HC-130J airframe. If used,
       Center of Gravity limits for takeoff and landing must be physically checked against T.O.
       1C-130(H)J-5. Estimated landing fuel function will also be used as software does not
       support HAAR, AAR, and present fuel burn rates. These items will be annotated in the
       additional remarks block of the AAF. Two copies will be printed, one will remain
       onboard until mission termination, make every attempt to leave the other copy with air
       terminal/maintenance personnel remaining on the ground.
   14.7.3. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the airplane will maintain the
   required documents.
 168                             AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   14.7.4. LMs, in units who authorize the use of Canned Forms F, will still compute an
   accurate operating weight in the CNI-MU.
14.8. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO). Use ERO procedures when necessary to
expedite aircraft or cargo movement, meet time requirements of unit moves, joint training
exercises, and contingencies or to enhance crew duty day.
   14.8.1. With the exception of small arms ammunition (Hazardous Class/Division 1.4), do not
   use ERO procedures when explosive cargo is involved unless authorized in the JA/ATT,
   exercise, operation or contingency air tasking order.
   14.8.2. ERO procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. Material handling
   equipment should be used if palletized cargo is to be onloaded or offloaded. PICs must
   assess prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure safe operations. NOTE:
   At the PICs discretion any category passenger may ERO. The number of passengers and
   amount of baggage to be onloaded or offloaded should be taken into consideration. The well
   being of the passengers should be considered at all times.    WARNING: Do not onload or
   offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and door at the same time. Paratroop
   doors will not normally be used.
       14.8.2.1. The PIC will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
       specific crewmember duties.
   14.8.3. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the LM may remove all tie-downs except
   one forward and one aft restraint, open the aft cargo door, and position the ramp no lower
   than horizontal. WARNING: If a combat offload of pallets is to be accomplished before
   offloading vehicles, do not remove any vehicle restraint until after the combat offload is
   complete. NOTE: LMs will ensure vehicles and troops proceed directly aft of the aircraft
   at least 50 ft before turning and/or 300 ft before stopping.  NOTE: If downloading to an
   empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required. Ensure the PERF WT and WT and
   BALANCE pages of the CNI-MU are updated prior to takeoff.
   14.8.4. During onload and offload through the crew entrance door, station a crewmember
   (normally the LM) on interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 ft and at a 45-degree
   angle from the aircraft axis. Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone
   cord.
   14.8.5. The LM will direct all onload and offload operations using prebriefed signals.
   Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember when enplaning or deplaning. Deplane
   passengers before cargo and enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location
   dictates otherwise. NOTE: Does not apply to INFIL/EXFIL operations. During
   INFIL/EXFIL operations onload and offload cargo per static training.
   14.8.6. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized provided the
   enplaning crew does not approach the aircraft until the deplaning LM on headset is in
   position outside the aircraft.
14.9. Combat Loading. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat
offload, passenger combat loading, and Infil/Exfil procedures. See AFTTP3-3.HC-130 for
additional guidance. All personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured except
those personnel having valid duties to perform.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    169


  14.9.1. Combat Offload. Combat Offload provides a means of off-loading single, multiple,
  and married pallets; ramp and airdrop platforms; and CDS containers without the use of
  Material Handling Equipment (MHE). OG/CCs or deployed equivalent may authorize
  combat off-load when hostile conditions or similar situations warrant the use of these
  procedures. The method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based on the
  conditions at the offload site.
     14.9.1.1. Combat Offload Method A.
         14.9.1.1.1. A taxiway or ramp at least 500 ft long is required; however, 1,000 ft is
         desired to provide a margin of safety. When pallets, platforms, or containers are
         offloaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded.
         Explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval of
         ACC/A3T. EXCEPTION: Small arms ammunition (hazard class and division 1.4)
         and explosives/munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without
         ACC/A3T approval. WARNING: Many explosive items have specific drop criteria
         that, if exceeded, render the item useless or dangerous to the user.      CAUTION:
         When using Method A on excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle-damaged
         surfaces, damage to the aircraft ramp may occur. Reducing forward taxi speed on
         these surfaces will reduce aircraft oscillation. The PIC must determine if the offload
         area will permit the offload operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft
         or equipment.
         14.9.1.1.2. Combat offload of fragile and sensitive cargo items (i.e., computers) that
         might be damaged by standard Method A combat offload procedures will not be
         attempted without user concurrence. If the nature of the mission dictates that cargo
         must be offloaded, aircrews may lower the ramp to approximately 18 inches above
         the ground. CAUTION: Do not attempt to lower the ramp below horizontal unless
         the UNRESTRICTED RAMP TRAVEL light is illuminated. EXCEPTION:
         UNRESTRICTED RAMP TRAVEL light will not illuminate when cargo
         compartment lights are in the covert position.         NOTE: Normal Method A
         procedures cannot be used with the ramp below the horizontal position. In this case
         the LM must release the locks using either the PLCUs or RECP Jettison switches.
         14.9.1.1.3. Pallets may be offloaded, without ballast, using Method A procedures
         provided their total weight does not exceed 12,000 lbs, and the height of the pallets
         fall within cargo height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or section V of
         the cargo loading manual.
         14.9.1.1.4. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 ft in length may be offloaded, without
         ballast, using Method A procedures provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 lbs.
         NOTE: Pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 lbs total weight may be
         offloaded using this method, provided ballast or cargo equal to the difference between
         12,000 lbs and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be offloaded) remains in C
         through F compartments during offload. Example: A 17,000 lb married pallet or
         airdrop platform requires 5,000 lbs of ballast or cargo to remain in C through F
         compartments during the offload.
         14.9.1.1.5. CDS may be combat offloaded using Method A procedures. The static
         line retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the
170                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         retriever is inoperative. With Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR), offload will be
         accomplished one side at a time if the total bundle weight exceeds 12,000 lbs. Non-
         CVR sticks may be offloaded if the total weight is less than 12,000 lbs. Without the
         CVR, if the total weight of the bundles exceeds 12,000 lbs bundles should be
         restrained in groups of four or less and offloaded one group at a time. For the
         unplanned combat offload of non-CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described
         above. Perform an initial offload via the static line retriever, and on sequential
         offload, remove aft restraint before clearing the pilot to taxi. Consider the slope of
         the offload site which may cause bundles to roll aft upon removal of restraint.
      14.9.1.2. Combat Offload Method B. Use this method to offload married pallets that do
      not fit the category for Method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets
      weighing between 12,000 to 15,000 lbs. Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums
      under each pallet to be offloaded. The correct number of steel drums needed to complete
      this type of offload must be available at the offload site or must accompany the load
      when conditions at the offload site are unknown. WARNING: The maximum weight
      for pallets to be offloaded across the ramp at any one time when using Method B is
      15,000 lbs. Do not use Method B for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the
      platform under the vertical restraint rails.
  14.9.2. Passenger Combat Loading. Additional procedures are located in AFTTP 3-3.HC-
  130. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated forces and foreign counterparts during
  operations, exercises, and training. Standard seating configurations listed in AFI 11-2HC-
  130JV3, Addenda A, HC-130J Configuration/Mission Planning, are recommended, if
  practical.
  14.9.3. Infil/Exfil Procedures. These procedures are only authorized when conducting
  Infil/Exfil operations with dedicated unconventional or CSAR/PR forces and foreign
  counterparts. If troops do not provide their own restraining devices, secure personnel using
  passenger combat loading procedures.
      14.9.3.1. Egress and Static Load Training. Conduct static load training prior to all
      Infil/Exfil operations. EXEPTION: For unilateral Infil/Exfil training conducted with
      home-station assigned units using ATV, Quads, Polaris, and Gator type vehicles, the
      OG/CC may waive this requirement.
      14.9.3.2. Vehicle Restraint Procedures. User will identify any "load specific" tie-down
      requirements or limitations.    WARNING: Chains positioned across the right side
      emergency exit will be connected to the sidewall tie-down ring with a tie-down device to
      expedite removal for emergency egress.
      14.9.3.3. LMs will wear NVGs during blacked-out rapid infil/exfil operations.
         14.9.3.3.1. LMs will wear NVGs on aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting;
         however, they may be raised when NVG lighting is illuminated.
      14.9.3.4. Loadmaster Infiltration/Exfiltration Guide. LMs will use the AFTTP 3-3.HC-
      130 to amplify flight manual procedures and guidance found in this instruction.
      14.9.3.5. Procedures after Touchdown:
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                               171


       14.9.3.5.1. Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the PF states, "Clear to
       open," or as prebriefed. Lower the ramp to the ground once the aircraft has stopped,
       parking brake has been set and the pilot states, "Clear to offload."    CAUTION:
       Maintain positive control of canary slides/ground loading ramps.
       14.9.3.5.2. Position canary slides/ground loading ramps. NOTE: If a time delay is
       anticipated before onloading, raise the ramp enough to allow the aircraft to taxi in the
       event of an emergency.
       14.9.3.5.3. Complete offload/onload.
       14.9.3.5.4. Raise canary slides/ground loading ramps.
       14.9.3.5.5. Raise the ramp to approximately 12” above horizontal.
       14.9.3.5.6. Notify the pilot, “Clear to taxi.”
       14.9.3.5.7. Secure canary slides/ground loading ramps.
       14.9.3.5.8. Close the ramp and door.
       14.9.3.5.9. Turn on red or NVG-compatible lights.
       14.9.3.5.10. Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles/equipment and exits are secure, and
       warning lights are extinguished.
       14.9.3.5.11. Place ADS latch handles in lock position after takeoff as soon as mission
       requirements allow
       14.9.3.5.12. Check vehicle tie-downs and secure cargo compartment after takeoff as
       soon as mission requirements allow.

                           COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES

15.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on communications procedures for all missions
and the requirement and completion of applicable forms.
   15.1.1. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all communications requirements, frequencies,
   special procedures necessary for optimum communication coverage, and in-flight
   troubleshooting of communications, navigation, IFF/SIF, and specialized mission equipment
   is provided. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other applicable technical
   orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the crew as necessary to
   accomplish this requirement. Communication duties are as follows: NOTE: The CP/PM
   will assist the CSO as required in accomplishment of duties.
   15.1.2. Pilot Monitoring (PM).
       15.1.2.1. Initiates and maintains communication with ATC and landing zone control
       personnel. Provides secure and non-secure communications IAW Command Electronic
       Order of Information (CEOI.)
       15.1.2.2. Zeroize all cryptographic devices, IFF/SIF, and clear classified frequencies
       prior to leaving the aircraft.
       15.1.2.3. Preflight and ensure IFF/SIF Modes are set IAW mission requirements.
   15.1.3. Combat Systems Operator (CSO.) Note: Accomplished by PM if no CSO onboard.
       15.1.3.1. Determines and coordinates frequencies and call signs and advises the PIC off
       all mission communications requirements.
       15.1.3.2. Initiates and maintains communication with C2 agencies, range control, combat
       control teams (CCT), drop zone control personnel, and other ground parties during
       mission events. Initiates frequency hopping, secure and non-secure communications
       IAW Command Electronic Order of Information (CEOI.) Compiles and transmit
       required in-flight and position reports to appropriate facilities.
       15.1.3.3. Signs out and maintains control of COMSEC and classified documents required
       during the mission. Annotate safe inventory and complete daily destruction as required.
       Return all COMSEC and classified materials to proper storage facilities.
       15.1.3.4. Keys all secure equipment and makes appropriate operational checks.
       15.1.3.5. Troubleshoots malfunctioning voice/data communication and navigation
       equipment and ensure discrepancies are annotated on the AFTO Form 781A.
       15.1.3.6. Provides a documented record of all pertinent events during the mission using
       AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log.
15.2. Frequency Listing.
   15.2.1. The crew will review applicable Air Tasking Orders and Special Instructions
   (ATO/SPINS) prior to each flight when deployed or during exercise participation. Use
   current FLIP, local IFGs and other documents as required to obtain frequency information.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 173


   NOTE: Figure 15.1-Figure 15.5 contain listings of commonly used frequencies, including
   search and rescue, citizen band, and the Maritime radio presets.
15.3. Communication Threat Planning. During contingency operations, or exercise
participation, the crew will obtain the most up to date information on enemy systems that may
affect communication, navigation, and IFF equipment in the mission area.      NOTE: HAVE
QUICK II and SINCGARS anti-jam capability is not secure and will not be used for classified
transmissions unless used in conjunction with a secure voice system.
15.4. Communication Procedures.
   15.4.1. Communication Checks. It is the responsibility of the crew to be aware of OPSEC
   requirements prior to making communication checks.
   15.4.2. Frequency Monitoring. The PIC will ensure a crewmember is monitoring ATC, C2,
   and Guard frequencies at all times.
   15.4.3. Weather Forecasts. For flights outside the local area, obtain the destination and
   alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and temperature, before
   reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA. Whenever SIGMETs are received,
   contact the nearest USAF weather facility to determine mission applicability.
   15.4.4. Designated crewmembers must be proficient in the use of and procedures contained
   within JAFPUB 33-2007 and ACPs to include ACP 122(D), Communication Instruction
   Security, ACP 125(F), Allied Communication Publication Communication Instruction
   Radiotelephone Procedures, ACP 131 US SUPP-1(D), US National Letter of Promulgation,
   ACP 135(E), Communication Instruction Signaling Procedures in the Visual Medium, ACP
   160(D), IFF/SIF Operational Procedures (NOFORN).
   15.4.5. JAFPUB 33-2007 prescribes procedures for HF communication between aircraft and
   ground stations for most circumstances. Ensure long-range communication, normally HF, is
   established prior to departing VHF/UHF range.
   15.4.6. Tactical Operations.
       15.4.6.1. Plan and fly missions using strict radio discipline to deny enemy DF, jamming
       and intrusion capability and ensure clear channels are available for emergencies. Limit
       transmissions to only those essential to mission accomplishment and use secure means
       when possible. Long range communication channels will be as directed by the mission
       controlling authority.
       15.4.6.2. JSIR Reporting. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) can be caused by enemy,
       neutral, friendly, or natural sources. The crew will report any hostile interference
       experienced while supporting joint operations IAW ATO/SPINS. When EMI is
       suspected to be non-intentional, file reports through the unit frequency manager. Refer to
       the FIH and CJCSM 3320.02-B, Joint Spectrum Interference Resolution (JSIR)
       Procedures for additional program and procedure information.
       15.4.6.3. Classified Transmissions. If classified transmissions are made during flight,
       power will remain applied to the CVR for at least 30 minutes after the final classified
       transmission is completed.
 174                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   15.4.7. Communication Reports. Forward all ATC communication and associated air
   reports (AIREP) to ICAO aeronautical stations IAW FLIP GP and FIH. Pass C2 and all
   other operational communication through the USAF HF/SSB GCCS or dedicated C2
   assigned station.

                                          Chapter 16

                       TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

Section 16A—General

16.1. General. Personnel Recovery (PR) is the umbrella term for operations focusing on
recovering captured, missing, or isolated personnel. This chapter provides procedures,
requirements, and restrictions for HC-130J tactical employment. Additional TTPs required by
crews in the tactical execution of PR are contained in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 and other tactics
manuals. In the case of conflict, the information in this instruction will take precedence.
16.2. Definitions. See Attachment 1 for a complete list of definitions used in this chapter.
16.3. Checklists/In-flight Guides. Amplified checklist information is included in Attachment
2 of this instruction. Abbreviated checklists/briefing guides are located in AFI 11-2HC-130JV3,
CL-1/2.
16.4. Crew Duties. All crewmembers will perform normal crew duties as outlined in
appropriate flight manuals and other chapters of this instruction. The following duties are
divided between all crew positions. CNI-MU programming/updating, time control, mission
planning, and monitoring of fuel status (fuel should be checked at least once every 60 minutes.)
The PIC will ensure all navigation and communication duties are clearly understood prior to
flight. This includes assigning responses for particular equipment in the tactical checklists.
Emphasis will be placed on all dual use controls (CNI-MU, LPCR, fuel panel, refuel control
panel, etc.) Specialized duties are as follows:
   16.4.1. Pilot Flying (PF).
       16.4.1.1. Maintains contour altitude and ensures terrain clearance.
       16.4.1.2. Responsible for time control when within one minute of TOT/TOA.
   16.4.2. Pilot Monitoring (PM).
       16.4.2.1. Runs all checklists unless delegated to another crewmember.
       16.4.2.2. Assists the CSO with maintaining proper flight path, acquiring controlling
       obstacles, and identifying the objective area.
       16.4.2.3. Backs up the PF by monitoring aircraft instruments and cross checking aircraft
       altitude and terrain clearance using NVGs and radar altimeter.
       16.4.2.4. During low level operations, state “190 knots” when airspeed decays below 190
       knots. Further announce in 10 knot increment airspeeds below 190 knots (e.g., “180,”
       “170”) until airspeed exceeds 190 knots.       EXCEPTION: Not required for planned
       slowdowns (HAAR, airdrops, Infil/Exfil, etc.)
   16.4.3. Combat Systems Operator (CSO).
       16.4.3.1. Advise the crew upon crossing the combat entry point (CEP), forward edge of
       the battle area (FEBA), forward line of troops (FLOT), passive detection line (PDL),
       combat exit point (CXP), etc.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   179


       16.4.3.2. Provide a turn point briefing prior to each leg of a route to include course
       heading, MSA, significant terrain, aircraft deviations, and anticipated threats. Be
       prepared to supply the PF with the highest altitude available, based on the threat, for each
       leg. Also, provides time warnings and advisories as appropriate.
       16.4.3.3. Directs low level navigation to include start climb points (SCPs), reference
       altitudes, and responsible for keeping time control within one minute of TOT/TOA.
       16.4.3.4. Assists the PF in maintaining terrain clearance, acquiring controlling obstacles,
       and maintaining desired flight path by using LPCR, EO-IR, or visually as required.
       16.4.3.5. Programs and monitors ECM gear. Accomplishes threat avoidance and
       maintains awareness of position relative to known threats and terrain. Directs defensive
       maneuvers and employs ECM, as appropriate. Advises the PF when clear of threats and
       able to resume planned heading, altitude, and airspeed.
   16.4.4. Loadmaster (LM).
       16.4.4.1. Responsible for rear quadrant visual threat detection. NOTE: When in a
       threat environment, crew members/pararescue stationed at a scanner position will hold
       the ALE-47 remote flare dispenser switches.
       16.4.4.2. Mask lights or install blackout kit as necessary. See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for
       items to be masked.
       16.4.4.3. Will be responsible for light signal communication IAW visual signals listed in
       ATP-56(B).
       16.4.4.4. Ensures that cargo compartment lights (except electroluminescent lights (EL),
       if installed) are off from ingress to egress in hostile areas at night.
16.5. Aircraft Preparation. All equipment such as pyrotechnics, excess seats, trashcans, etc.,
not essential to the mission should be removed from the aircraft prior to a combat mission.
Securely tie down all other equipment.
16.6. Survival and Protective Equipment. All personnel will wear the survival and protective
gear provided during hostile environment operations. Unit/deployed commanders may amend
survival/protective equipment requirements based on the threat. See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for a
list of survival/protective equipment.
16.7. Use of Laptop Computers During Flight. Electro-magnetic Interference (EMI) certified
laptop computers and software, such as PFPS, are allowed in-flight IAW AFI 11-202V3, and
their use is highly encouraged. These systems do not replace existing navigation equipment,
must not be used as the sole means of navigation, and must not interfere with the
accomplishment of normal duties.
   16.7.1. Each user must have a back-up paper chart immediately available in case use of the
   system is denied.
16.8. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) General.
   16.8.1. Limitations. All aircrew will be familiar with the limitations associated with NVG
   use as discussed in AFMAN 11-217V3, Supplemental Flight Information, and AFTTP 3-
 180                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.HC-130. NOTE: The route study should emphasize NVG limitations and performance
   factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.
   16.8.2. Preflight. Each crewmember will preflight their own NVGs before flight and carry a
   spare set of batteries. The PIC must designate a crewmember to preflight and carry a spare
   set of NVGs onboard the aircraft. Each crewmember will also carry an NVG-compatible
   light source.
   16.8.3. In-flight Requirements. When NVG use is required, the pilots, CSO, LMs, and
   scanners should wear them or have them immediately available based on mission
   requirements.
       16.8.3.1. Pilots will wear NVGs with similar acuity and gain. WARNING: NVGs and
       associated components (battery cords, safety cords, and other hardware) can become
       entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other controls. Any
       interference can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of other critical
       switches or controls. Pilots must exercise extreme care during seat changes.
       16.8.3.2. Panoramic NVG (PNVG) Usage. Only pilots are authorized use of AN/AVS-
       10 PNVGs.
16.9. Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements. The minimum operating equipment
required for tactical employment is contained in Table 16.1. Aircrew experience level and
mission factors may dictate greater equipment requirements than those listed.

16.10. Mission Planning. Refer to AFTTP 3-1/3.HC-130 for in-depth mission planning and
employment considerations. For complex missions, a minimum of one full day should be
allocated for mission planning. NOTE: PR is a very demanding mission due to the time-critical
nature involved in the recovery of survivors. Because of their medical condition, survivors may
perish while a traditional preplanned mission is formulated. Most searches are part of an effort
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    181


to save life; therefore, make every effort to complete the search as rapidly and efficiently as
possible. A thorough scan of the search area and accurate navigation significantly increases the
probability of detection. Reactions to sightings must be timely and accurate. Operational
procedures for conducting effective searches can be found in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. Refer to the
IAMSARV1/V2 for additional information.
   16.10.1. Enroute Planning. Crews should fly tactical missions at the highest altitude
   commensurate with the threat(s) environment. During training, greater weather or altitude
   minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, or training considerations. NOTE:
   A daylight route survey will be conducted for all unpublished training routes prior to
   NVG/IMC operations.
       16.10.1.1. Whenever possible, plan the leg course prior to the IP or ARIP, to be within
       30 degrees of the run-in or AR track course.
       16.10.1.2. During contingency or combat operations, flying portions of planned flights in
       IMC may be necessary to accomplish mission objectives; however, due to aircraft
       equipment limitations, operational employment in a low level environment should be
       considered a last resort. The pilots and CSO must consider the terrain, accuracy of the
       altimeter setting, and increased mid-air potential prior to IMC profiles being attempted.
   16.10.2. NVG Low Level Specific Requirements.
       16.10.2.1. Lunar Illumination Criteria. There is no minimum illumination requirement
       to conduct NVG modified contour low level operations. Aircrews will use 0.8 millilux
       (.00008 lux) effective illumination as a standard for low illumination and increased risk
       mitigation. This roughly equates to 10% lunar illumination on a clear night. When
       effective illumination is below 0.8 millilux, crews will obtain squadron CC/DO approval
       prior to flight, add low illumination as a factor in their risk assessment, and mitigate the
       risk. This may require changing profile, airspeeds, or altitudes among many other
       options. NOTE: Lack of sufficient illumination may prevent NVG contour operations
       in otherwise VMC conditions.
       16.10.2.2. Reference Altitudes and Start Climb Points (SCPs). The CSO will compute
       reference altitudes and SCPs for all NVG low level routes and brief them during route
       study.
           16.10.2.2.1. Reference Altitudes. Reference altitudes are designed to provide terrain
           masking and terrain clearance along the planned flight path. Calculate reference
           altitudes by adding the appropriate enroute AGL (contour) altitude to predicted
           terrain elevation (e.g., chart, DTED) within 1 NM either side course centerline or
           planned flight path. Computation and frequency of reference altitudes should take
           into account terrain topography, turn radius of aircraft, chart deficiencies, navigation
           system accuracy, threat environment, terrain elevation data accuracy, aircraft
           performance, and crew experience. Keep in mind the PF will rely more heavily on
           reference altitudes as illumination decreases.
           16.10.2.2.2. SCPs. SCPs are predetermined points, at a distance-to-go, where the
           aircraft should start a climb to a reference altitude based on an obstacle in its flight-
           path. Evaluate the entire leg for rapidly rising terrain and compute SCPs when there
           is a terrain differential of 1,000 ft or greater over 4 NMs or less. Since the primary
 182                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


           source for NVG low level altitude is visual pilotage, CSO should assume the aircraft
           will be at the lowest possible point within the corridor and compute climbs from
           there. When calculating SCPs in this manner, greater terrain differentials will result,
           placing SCPs further away from critical terrain. This approach will result in less
           aggressive climb profiles, allowing the aircraft to retain a greater amount of energy in
           mountainous terrain. In addition, regardless of planned visibility or illumination,
           consider tailwind effects and one-engine inoperative performance. Continue to
           evaluate planned climb schedule during execution.
               16.10.2.2.2.1. SCP Calculations. Calculate SCPs IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
               Normally, climb rate should be based on 1,000 ft per minute. Density altitude,
               aircraft gross weight, and tailwinds may require pilots to add distance to SCPs.
               NOTE: Due to errors in DTED, consider using reported DTED accuracy (if
               available) and applying it to the user-specified buffer altitude when computing
               reference altitudes.
   16.10.3. Fuel Planning. For tactical low level operations, assume a 5,000 lbs per hour fuel
   burnoff rate unless more accurate data is available.
   16.10.4. Threat Analysis. Refer to AFTTP 3-1.1 and AFTTP 3-1.2 for in-depth information
   of threat system capabilities and limitations, as well as threat employment techniques.
16.11. Briefing Requirements. Conduct aircrew briefings IAW paragraph 6.14 of this
instruction and the guidance below:
   16.11.1. During the mission crew briefing, the PIC will brief all applicable items from the
   PIC’s briefing guide located in AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 CL-1.
   16.11.2. Tactical Briefings. All tactical sorties will include a route study and tactical
   briefing. The CSO will brief all applicable items from the CSO’s briefing guide located in
   AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 CL-1. All pilots and CSO are required to attend the tactical route study
   and briefing. NOTE: The route study will emphasize NVG limitations and performance
   factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.
16.12. Chart Requirements. Planned low level routes will be drawn/printed on a 1:500,000
(TPC or Sectional) or larger scale chart. Use a 1:250,000 (JOG) or larger scale chart for
overland threat penetration operations, mountainous NVG low-level operations, and the
objective areas, unless not available, or of an inferior quality to a TPC. WARNING: Mixing
multiple coordinate data can cause significant navigation and target errors. The consistent use of
data for all coordinates greatly reduces these errors. Use the same datum to derive coordinates
for all mission requirements. WARNING: Do not use the PFPS TCA tool as the sole source
for calculating MSA/ESA. Although the TCA tool accounts for both DTED and VVOD
elevations utilizing PFPS 4.XX and later versions, aircrew must still manually verify all
MSA/ESA elevations to account for potential DTED errors, surveyed chart spot elevations, or
any other discrepancies (e.g., ECHUM versus VVOD). WARNING: Aeronautical charts do
not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 ft AGL or a change in terrain until it exceeds the
chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a 199 ft tower sat on terrain with an
elevation just below the next higher contour. For a 1:500,000 (TPC) with a contour interval of
500 ft, this would result in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 ft above charted terrain.
Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the highest terrain as in the
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   183


case of gradually rising elevations. NOTE: Whenever available (e.g., in most instances) Level
II DTED will be utilized when determining controlling obstacle elevations. Likewise, selection
of VVOD overlay shall not implement option to hide towers when determining controlling
obstacles.        NOTE: Color copies, laminated, and PFPS charts are acceptable forms of
hardcopy charts provided the contour and contrast remain intact and the chart is used for
preflight route study and the flight. If using laminated charts, the crew will ensure that the
laminate does not degrade the quality or readability of the chart and that all data remains intact.
NOTE: For local training routes, if a mountainous NVG route has been planned using a JOG
and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC or
Sectional. NOTE: Classify charts accordingly based on the information sources and methods
used to obtain data.
   16.12.1. Minimum Hardcopy Chart Requirements for Mission Planning and Flight.
       16.12.1.1. The CSO will carry a hardcopy chart (or set of charts as required) that covers
       all enroute and objective mission areas.
       16.12.1.2. The pilot and copilot may share a single low level/objective area chart during
       flight. If this option is used, both the pilot and copilot must participate in pre-mission
       route analysis using the single chart(s).
   16.12.2. Use dark ink, pencil, or symbol tapes to portray course lines. Obstacles and other
   chart entries may be drawn or highlighted in any legible color.
   16.12.3. When strip charts are used, the CSO will prepare a larger scale chart (i.e., ONC,
   JNC) to allow for major unplanned deviations during critical mission phases and emergency
   egress.
   16.12.4. When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap.
   16.12.5. Chart Annotation. At a minimum, low level charts will be annotated IAW Table
   16.2.

NOTES:
1. If planned route is different than course line, draw deviation lines. Annotate magnetic heading information near
these deviation lines (if desired) to aid in dead reckoning during significant turns.
2. Place a box around the obstacle or terrain that defines the MSA for each leg.
3. Place the ESA in bold numbers on the chart. When multiple ESAs are used, or when using strip charts, annotate
ESA on each chart segment. Place a double box around the obstacle or terrain that defines each ESA.
4. If the leg is split between two charts, place a Course Arrow Box on both charts.
5. Required for NVG low-level operations. Place SCPs and associated reference altitude at the required distance to
go where the start climb (S/C) is to be initiated. Annotate as follows: “S/C 17/12/3500” or “S/C 17/3500/12” or
“S/C 3500/17/12.” Example indicates a S/C to 3500’ MSL reference altitude, started at 17 NMs to go and at
reference altitude by 12 NM to go.
6. Calculate IMC airdrop SDPs IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 IFR Drop Corridor procedures.

Section 16B—Enroute Operations

16.13. Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude.
   16.13.1. Minimum IFR enroute altitude is IAW AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented.
   EXCEPTION: For contingency operations, compute minimum IFR enroute altitude by
   adding 1,000 ft (2,000 ft in mountainous terrain) to the highest obstacle or terrain feature
   within 5 NM either side of route centerline, and rounded up to the next 100-ft increment. For
   routes where the terrain varies significantly, crews may establish a separate minimum IFR
   enroute altitude for route segments with similar terrain or obstacle elevations.
   16.13.2. Descent below IFR minimum altitudes, listed above, is only authorized under the
   following conditions:
      16.13.2.1. Intercepting glideslope for an approved IMC SCA.
      16.13.2.2. Reaching the Drop Zone Entry Point for IMC airdrop.
      16.13.2.3. Established on an ATC provided minimum radar vectoring altitude available
      from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility.
      16.13.2.4. Established on a published IFR route or instrument approach procedure
      compatible with aircraft navigation systems.
      16.13.2.5. IMC descent to VFR.
16.14. Low Level Operations. VFR tactical operations conducted below 3,000 ft AGL are
considered low level operations.
   16.14.1. AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 augments procedures in this instruction. WARNING: The
   CSO or PM must continually keep the PF apprised of flight progress and anticipated terrain
   elevations, obstructions, start climb points, and start descent points.
   16.14.2. Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements. IAW Table 16.1.
   16.14.3. Weather Minimums. Conduct modified contour low level operations in VMC.
   NOTE: This does not preclude the pilot from VFR filing requirements in AFI 11-202V3 or
   applicable ICAO/host nation requirements if operating outside CONUS.               WARNING:
   Operating under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is normally an emergency procedure
   during training or exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls to the area air
   traffic control agency. During contingency or combat operations, flying portions of planned
   flights in IMC may be necessary to accomplish mission objectives; however, due to aircraft
   equipment limitations, operational employment in a low level environment should be
   considered a last resort. The pilots and CSO must consider the terrain, accuracy of the
   altimeter setting, and increased mid-air potential prior to IMC profiles being attempted.
   16.14.4. Low Level Altitudes.
      16.14.4.1. Lowest Acceptable Altitude (LAA). During training operations, higher
      weather or altitude minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, training
      considerations, or crew experience. LAAs allowed for enroute modified contour low
      level operations are:
186                           AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      16.14.4.1.1. Day VMC LAA. LAA is 300 ft AGL modified contour above the
      terrain (except when using Threat Penetration Altitude), by visual reference to both
      the terrain and radar altimeter. Momentary terrain clearance deviations are expected
      and allowed due to terrain variance; however, crews must avoid sustained deviations
      below LAA.
      16.14.4.1.2. Night VMC (Non-NVG) LAA. LAA is MSA. When the altitude for the
      next leg or segment is higher than the altitude currently being flown, complete the
      climb prior to the turn point or segment. When the altitude for the next leg segment is
      lower than the current altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg
      or segment. EXCEPTION: During terminal area operations (airdrops and
      approaches), do not descend from enroute altitude until the objective is identified and
      adequate terrain clearance is assured.
      16.14.4.1.3. IMC LAA. LAA is MSA. When the altitude for the next leg or segment
      is higher than the altitude currently being flown, complete the climb prior to the turn
      point or segment. When the altitude for the next leg segment is lower than the current
      altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg or segment. NOTE:
      During training, conduct planned IMC routes under instrument flight rules (IFR)
      unless FLIP, ICAO, or host nation rules define other procedures.
      16.14.4.1.4. NVG LAA. LAA is 500 ft AGL modified contour above the terrain
      (except when using Threat Penetration Altitude), by visual reference to both the
      terrain and radar altimeter. Momentary terrain clearance deviations are expected and
      allowed due to terrain variance; however, crews must avoid sustained deviations
      below LAA.
      16.14.4.1.5. Threat Penetration (TP) LAA. LAA is 200 ft AGL for day VMC
      operations and 300 ft AGL for NVG operations.
         16.14.4.1.5.1. During combat operations, limit the time spent at TP altitude to the
         duration needed to avoid/negate the specific threat.
         16.14.4.1.5.2. During training operations, fly TP altitudes with the following
         restrictions:
             16.14.4.1.5.2.1. A mission IP must be in either seat.
             16.14.4.1.5.2.2. Not authorized on unfamiliar routes.
             16.14.4.1.5.2.3. Pre-planned and restricted to flat/rolling terrain and coastal
             penetrations.
             16.14.4.1.5.2.4. No "Break" or "Hard Turn" calls may be made. "Turn" calls
             are allowed. If a turn requires more than 20 degrees angle of bank, the aircraft
             will terminate TP operations and immediately climb to a normal modified
             contour profile, MSA, or ESA as required.
             16.14.4.1.5.2.5. No simulated emergencies allowed. WARNING: Severely
             restrict bank angles below 200 ft AGL. Due to the close proximity to the
             ground, aircrews must be cautious of any descending vector that may develop
             during TP operations.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  187


       16.14.4.2. Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat during low level flight.
       EXCEPTION: If performing a planned seat swap for training with an IP in the seat,
       climb to a safe altitude.
   16.14.5. NVG Enroute and Objective Area Navigation. Obstacle avoidance at night is
   accomplished using NVGs, LPCR, EO-IR, and radar altimeter along with flying reference
   altitudes as necessary to maintain terrain clearance. Higher altitudes up to MSA may be
   required. WARNING: NVG low level flight and low illumination air refueling increase the
   chance crewmembers will experience spatial disorientation.
       16.14.5.1. Once the reference altitude controlling obstacle is called in sight, the PF may
       fly below reference altitude as desired. The PF will notify the crew any time the aircraft
       descends below reference altitude. If a higher reference altitude is based on an
       obstruction beyond the PFs line of sight, the CSO will direct a climb at the SCP to the
       new reference altitude. Once the obstruction becomes visible, the PF may continue the
       climb or fly below reference altitude. WARNING: If at any time the PF loses sight of
       the reference altitude controlling obstruction, the PF will fly the computed reference
       altitudes. WARNING: Flying below reference altitude directly affects SCPs. CSO
       must evaluate the impact of flying below reference altitudes and determine if a start climb
       is required earlier than planned due to aircraft altitude.
16.15. Low Level Emergency Procedures. The procedures listed below apply to both training
and contingency operations. EXCEPTION: During combat operations, a climb to MSA/ESA
may expose the aircraft to greater hazard due to enemy threat detection. The PIC may climb to a
Detection Free Altitude (DFA) or intermediate altitude during a low level emergency. Base the
decision to use this lower altitude after a thorough pre-mission assessment of the enemy’s overall
threat detection capability and nature of the emergency.
   16.15.1. Crew Disorientation. When a crew becomes disoriented on a low level mission,
   start a climb to ESA. Continue the climb until ESA is reached or a positive fix is obtained.
   After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low level operations. The CSO/PM will
   crosscheck timing and adjust as necessary.
   16.15.2. Spatial Disorientation or NVG Malfunction. The PM will be ready to immediately
   take control of the aircraft if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or NVG malfunction.
       16.15.2.1. If either pilot experiences spatial disorientation or NVG malfunction, start a
       climb to at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready to resume PM or
       PF duties. Continue low level operations at PICs discretion.
       16.15.2.2. During NVG takeoff or landing, the PM must react quickly to assume control
       and execute the appropriate action, regardless of qualification or pilot position. The CP
       must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver.
   16.15.3. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. Climb to MSA if unable to avoid flight into
   weather conditions that prohibit VMC operations. A further climb to ESA may be required.
   After VMC is reestablished, continue low level operations at PICs discretion.
   16.15.4. Aircraft System Failure. Start a climb to MSA when a known or suspected
   malfunction prevents continued safe low level operations. Maintain at least MSA until
   completion of troubleshooting. If the aircraft meets minimum operating equipment
 188                                 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   requirements IAW Chapter 4 and Table 16.1, the crew may continue low level operations at
   PICs discretion. Aircraft not meeting requirements will fly at MSA or higher.
   16.15.5. Emergency Climb. The decision to execute an emergency climb should be made as
   soon as possible. The procedure should be considered in cases of, but not limited to, certain
   equipment malfunctions, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather penetration, loss of
   situational awareness, and imminent contact with the terrain. Any crewmember may initiate
   an emergency climb by stating “EMERGENCY CLIMB.” See Table 16.3 for emergency
   climb procedure.

Table 16.3. Emergency Climb Procedure.
1. Announce “Emergency Climb” to the crew over interphone.
2. Set TAKEOFF power, level the wings and close bleed air valve switches.
CAUTION: Closing the bleed air valves will result in depressurizing the aircraft. Use caution in
areas of high terrain as cabin altitude may exceed 10,000 ft. The onset of hypoxia symptoms may
complicate judgment.
CAUTION: Closing the bleed air valves may result in decreased equipment cooling and may
degrade critical component operation.
3. Close Ramp and Door (if open.)
4. For zero flaps (e.g., enroute) adjust the pitch to maintain at 10 knots above stall warning caret.
For any flap setting (e.g., airdrop, HAAR) set flaps to 50% and adjust the pitch to maintain at 10
knots above stall warning caret.
5. Turn away (with consideration for stall margin) from terrain if feasible. If not possible, climb
straight ahead for the maximum climb angle.
WARNING: If flaps are up and turning is required, additional flaps may be necessary to avoid an
accelerated stall.
WARNING: A low altitude stall has a high probability of resulting in a crash and loss of life.
WARNING: Any bank angle during this procedure will result in a lower than possible climb
gradient and increases stall speed. A wings level climb will result in the maximum angle/rate of
climb.
6. The PM will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate. Pilots must monitor stall caret.
7. The CSO should state the MSA. The CSO will monitor terrain (via LPCR) and call “CLEAR
OF TERRAIN” when above all critical terrain. If the straight-ahead flight path vector will not
provide terrain clearance, the CSO will state optimum heading.
8. When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power and airspeed for a normal climb out and level off
and return all switches to their normal position.
WARNING: If impact with terrain is imminent, use 100% flaps, 10 kts above power off stall
speed and crash the aircraft straight ahead.
16.16. Simulated Emergencies During Low Level Training. Simulated emergencies may be
conducted during enroute low level training on local routes. Aircrew will comply with the
following restrictions in addition to those listed in Chapter 9:
   16.16.1. Restricted to flat or rolling terrain.
   16.16.2. Simulated emergencies will only be conducted on specific legs identified during the
   crew briefing.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    189


   16.16.3. Do not compound emergencies.
   16.16.4. As determined by the IP, initiate a climb to an intermediate altitude, DFA, or MSA.
   Continue a climb to or maintain required altitude until the completion of the simulated
   emergency.
16.17. Degraded Systems Training (DST). DST is used to prepare crews to accomplish
missions simulating certain pieces of equipment inoperative (or intentionally turned off for
emission control.) On non-local routes, designate leg segments during the route briefing. The
following restrictions and procedures are designed to maximize training and safety.
   16.17.1. Restrictions:
       16.17.1.1. Visibility must be 5 SM minimum.
       16.17.1.2. One radar altimeter must be operational and on.
       16.17.1.3. The LPCR must be operational.
       16.17.1.4. A mission instructor must be in either the pilot or CSO position.
       16.17.1.5. One HDD at any crew position must be selected and monitored by an
       instructor (P/CSO) for DST of the navigation system.
   16.17.2. PICs will brief the following items:
       16.17.2.1. Equipment simulated inoperative.
       16.17.2.2. Aircrew coordination.
       16.17.2.3. Disorientation and emergency procedures.
16.18. Expendables/ECM Training. Conduct all expendables training IAW AFI 11-214, AFI
10-706, Electronic Warfare (EW) Operations, and host nation directives. Dispense only when
approved by the controlling agency IAW agency procedures and restrictions. When over open
water, do not drop expendables below 500 ft AGL or within 3 NM of any surface vessel,
platform, or landmass.
16.19. Barometric Altimeter Settings. Altimeter update points should be planned for enroute
portions of the mission. Sources of update include weather forecast, ground reporting stations,
and crew updates. It is vital that aircrews accurately update all altimeters prior to low level and
objective areas. When a current local altimeter setting is not available and an altitude update
(ALT UPDATE) cannot be accomplished, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting.
   16.19.1. An ALT UPDATE derived aircraft altimeter setting should only be used outside
   ATC controlled environments. An ALT UPDATE should be performed prior to all airdrops
   or landings. Obtain an ALT UPDATE as close to the objective area and as near the objective
   altitude as possible. Use sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters and crosscheck
   elevations and new settings with all available information.
       16.19.1.1. The CSO will update the pressure altimeter by recording the current altimeter
       setting, AGL altitude from the radar altimeter, and the MSL altitude from the pressure
       altimeter over a known elevation and computing a new setting. This works well when
       flying over a body of water, or flat terrain. Ensure the radar altimeter is fully operational
       and use sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters. WARNING: Use extreme
 190                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       caution when updating the pressure altimeter to a higher setting, as lower absolute
       altitudes will result.
   16.19.2. Cold Weather Altimeter Corrections. Apply corrections to any barometric altitude
   (MSA, ESA, reference altitude, drop altitude, SCA backup altitudes, SCA minimums, etc.)
   used during low level operations when the outside air temperature is below 32ºF/0ºC.
16.20. Radar Altimeter Settings. All crew positions will use the same radar altimeter setting.
   16.20.1. Low Level Settings. Set radar altimeters no lower than 10% below minimum
   enroute altitude (i.e. minimum setting of 450 ft for 500 ft NVG modified contour and 180 ft
   for day TP altitude at 200 ft.)
   16.20.2. Airdrop Settings.
       16.20.2.1. Low Altitude Airdrops. The radar altimeter should be set no lower than 10%
       below drop altitude.
       16.20.2.2. High Altitude Airdrops. Set the radar altimeter at the discretion of the PIC.
   16.20.3. The PF will make an immediate correction any time the system provides an
   “Altitude-Altitude” annunciation. NOTE: Regardless of the radar altimeter setting used,
   the PF will not wait for an annunciation to begin a correction to altitude.
16.21. Use of TCAS During Tactical Operations.
   16.21.1. TCAS.
       16.21.1.1. Crews may operate TCAS in TA-only mode during low level operations.
       16.21.1.2. Crews will operate TCAS in TA-only mode during airdrop, HAAR, and AAR
       operations.

Section 16C—Terminal Area Operations

16.22. Infil/Exfil Operations.
   16.22.1. General. Use the INFIL/EXFIL checklist and procedures to transition from the low
   level environment to place the aircraft on final approach, properly configured, in a position to
   identify the landing area, complete a landing, conduct a rapid onload or offload (if required),
   and quickly return to the low level environment. The INFIL/EXFIL checklist is used during
   tactical operations and replaces the APPROACH, BEFORE and AFTER LANDING,
   BEFORE TAKEOFF, LINE UP, and AFTER TAKEOFF checklists. Use the checklist for
   day or NVG operations and to make overt and covert/blacked-out landings.
       16.22.1.1. When the tactical situation dictates flying an instrument approach while
       utilizing the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, ensure all briefing items from Step 5 of the
       APPROACH checklist are covered in the INFIL/EXFIL checklist crew briefing.
       Multiple instrument approaches for training will not be accomplished utilizing the
       INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
   16.22.2. Aircraft Preparation.
       16.22.2.1. Chemical lights. During blacked-out operations attach chemical lights to each
       emergency exit handle with tape in such a way as to allow a small amount of light to
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    191


     shine through. WARNING: Chemical lights attached to exit doors and emergency
     escape hatch handles will remain in place until mission completion.
  16.22.3. Aircrew Requirements. Aircrew may fly NVG airland operations commensurate
  with their level of qualification.
  16.22.4. Approach to LZ.
     16.22.4.1. Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements.               See Table 16.1 for any
     restrictions for the approach type being flown to an LZ.
     16.22.4.2. NVG Batteries. Each pilot will silently check both NVG batteries are
     operational during the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
     16.22.4.3. Barometric Altimeter Setting. The CSO will determine the most accurate
     altimeter setting for the LZ using all available sources.
     16.22.4.4. Radar Altimeters. Radar altimeters should remain set at enroute altitude.
     16.22.4.5. Flap Settings. Verify desired flap setting prior to reaching threshold speed.
  16.22.5. Descent. Do not descend below 300 ft AGL until both pilots visually identify the
  LZ environment. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "zone in sight,” its clock
  position, and any discrepancies (i.e., any lights out, etc.) Both pilots will then confirm the
  zone and crosscheck the alignment for proper heading.         WARNING: Do not initiate a
  descent below 300 ft AGL prior to 2 NM to touchdown. This will cause the glideslope to be
  excessively shallow.
     16.22.5.1. Landing lights. Depending on the type of landing, the pilot will select either
     overt or covert lighting. If the PF requires lights to acquire the LZ, he will call for “taxi
     lights,” the PM will turn on the taxi lights. If the PF requires additional lights he will call
     for “landing lights,” the PM will turn on both the taxi and landing lights.
         16.22.5.1.1. Aircraft lighting will be as briefed/directed by ground parties for
         authentication purposes. The use of covert lighting will be thoroughly briefed in
         respect to the threat, runway environment, and authentication procedures.
     16.22.5.2. The CSO will call 100, 50, 25 and 10 ft above touchdown.
  16.22.6. Go-Around and Departure Procedures. Identify a go-around point during pre-
  mission planning for all NVG airland operations. When executing a go-around or departure,
  the CSO will call out passing through 100, 200, and 300 ft AGL. Whether maneuvering for
  another approach or proceeding with the route, plan to fly no lower than enroute LAA unless
  operational requirements dictate other altitudes. During a go-around, initiate the GO
  AROUND Procedure. WARNING: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation
  during NVG go-arounds and departures.
     16.22.6.1. Immediate Landing Feasible. If an immediate visual approach and landing are
     feasible, clear vigilantly for obstacles. Maneuver the aircraft to be 500 ft AGL wings
     level and configured at approximately a 2 NM final. The PF will keep the landing zone
     insight during this maneuver.
     16.22.6.2. Immediate Landing Not Feasible. If an immediate approach and landing are
     not feasible, maneuver the aircraft to the IP or next waypoint at or above enroute LAA
 192                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       unless operational requirements dictate other altitudes. When an immediate landing is
       not feasible, execute the AFTER TAKEOFF checklist after the completion of the GO
       AROUND Procedure.
   16.22.7. Ground Operations.
       16.22.7.1. The ON THE RUNWAY checklist is automatically initiated when the pilot
       clears the ramp and door. During the initial Infil/Exfil briefing, the pilot may pre-brief
       the opening of the ramp and door upon reversing of the engines. In this case, opening the
       ramp and door initiates the ON THE RUNWAY checklist.
       16.22.7.2. The copilot and CSO will assist the pilot in locating the offload/onload site
       once taxi speed is reached and will aid in clearing for other aircraft and obstructions.
       16.22.7.3. Use IR taxi and landing lights to the minimum extent required to maintain
       visual references during taxi operations and takeoff roll. Interior lighting is the same as
       for the approach and landing.
   16.22.8. Overt Landings Following NVG Landings. If the sortie will continue with Non-
   NVG VFR traffic patterns, accomplish either the COMBAT EXIT and TOUCH AND GO
   LANDING checklists or the INFIL/EXFIL OPTION LANDING checklist. If only a few
   patterns are planned, the INFIL/EXFIL OPTION LANDING checklist is quicker and easier
   to use. If many patterns or instrument work is planned, the COMBAT EXIT and TOUCH
   AND GO LANDING checklists are appropriate.
   16.22.9. Infil/Exfil Option Landing Procedures. Fly a normal visual pattern. Pilots will call
   “zone in sight” as they turn final and the CSO will make standard altitude advisory calls on
   descent.
   16.22.10. Loss of NVGs.
       16.22.10.1. Before Landing. If the PF or PM loses use of their NVGs inside of 1 NM,
       perform a go-around.
       16.22.10.2. After Takeoff. Transfer aircraft control and continue the climb to enroute
       altitude or MSA as appropriate.
       16.22.10.3. On the Ground. The PF will determine whether to continue the landing
       rollout or takeoff roll as applicable. The PM should be prepared to turn on overt lighting
       at the direction of the PF in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll.
16.23. Self-Contained Approach (SCA). SCA procedures may be used for approaches to
conventional airfields and assault zones, and for either overt or NVG airland operations.
Conduct SCAs using the tactical INFIL/EXFIL checklist procedures or from the normal
APPROACH and BEFORE LANDING checklists. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host
nation agreements, as appropriate.
   16.23.1. Weather Minimums:
       16.23.1.1. Unpublished SCAs will be conducted VMC.
       16.23.1.2. IMC SCA wx minimums will be IAW the published procedure, but no lower
       than 300-1.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                               193


     16.23.1.3. IMC SCAs will be flown IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and the following
     guidance:
        16.23.1.3.1. Flown from a published SCA approach.
     16.23.1.3.2. Required navigation accuracy for an IMC SCA is:
        16.23.1.3.3. To provide an early indication of degraded navigation accuracy, set the
        POS ALERT(s) at 0.03 NM (55 yards; FOM 2) and 0.05 NM (110 yards; FOM 4). If
        both INAV solution FOM's are less than or equal to 4 and no POS ALERTS (INAV
        Pos Miscompare ACAWS/INAV Pos Difference ACAWS) are indicated, navigation
        accuracy (300 yd CEP) is verified. If these conditions are not met a radar or visual
        update is necessary to verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to performing SCAs.
        NOTE: Anytime a position bias (update) has been added to the EGI INAV solution,
        displayed FOM values do not reflect the result of the bias.
        16.23.1.3.4. For any SCA, verify navigation accuracy within 10 minutes of the FAF.
        Do not descend from FAF altitude without verifying the active ship solution if any of
        the following conditions exists: either FOM greater than 4, INAV Pos Miscompare
        ACAWS, or INAV Pos Difference ACAWS.
     16.23.1.4. Both pilots or a pilot a CSO will verify runway point of intercept (RPI) or LZ
     coordinates in the mission computer. Verify the CNI-MU LZ information with a valid LZ
     survey.
  16.23.2. Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements. See Table 16.1.
  16.23.3. Pre-mission Requirements.
     16.23.3.1. SCA Construction. Construct SCAs IAW the guidance found in AFTTP 3-
     3.HC-130.
        16.23.3.1.1. Chart Scale. Use the largest scale chart available from 10 NM inbound.
        A 1:50,000 chart is preferred, but in no case will it be smaller than 1:250,000.
        16.23.3.1.2. The CSO/pilot will construct an approach plate for the SCA using the
        AF Form 4118, SCA Planning Form, computer Approach Planning Tool (APT), or an
        OGV approved planning form.
     16.23.3.2. Plan a minimum 7 NM for a straight-in approach unless the order of battle
     prohibits it. Plan and execute turning SCAs, dogleg SCAs etc. IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
     If developing an SCA for IMC use, plan a minimum 10 NM straight-in approach.
     16.23.3.3. Plan to intercept a 3 degree glideslope from enroute altitude unless terrain or
     obstructions dictate a different glideslope. Avoid using glideslopes greater than 5
     degrees. Slowdown to threshold speed approximately 3 NM prior to intercepting the
     glideslope.
  16.23.4. Missed Approach Point (MAP). The MAP will be at zero distance to go on the
  mission computer or as required on the SCA plate at MDA.
  16.23.5. Approach Execution:
 194                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       16.23.5.1. General. The CSO will make distance calls at every mile inside 10 miles and
       every half mile inside 3 miles (or as briefed.) NOTE: Each pilot will silently check both
       NVG batteries are operational during the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
       16.23.5.2. Inbound to LZ. Maintain enroute profile until descent to MDA. Initiate
       slowdown at the point identified during mission planning. Slow the aircraft to no less
       than 50 percent threshold speed, configure the flaps and gear as airspeed permits. Call
       for 100% flaps as airspeed permits. Confirm 100% flaps are set prior to reaching
       threshold speed. NOTE: The EO-IR is helpful in LZ identification and should be used
       to scan the LZ for obstructions, but it is not intended to be used to fly the entire SCA.
       WARNING: Do not slow to threshold speed until established on final for both straight-in
       and turning SCAs.
       16.23.5.3. Descent. At glideslope interception, the CSO will state "begin descent," and
       repeat the desired initial descent rate. The CSO will provide glide-path advisories with
       reference to the mission computer, pressure altimeter, and radar altimeter. These calls
       will be made at 1/2 NM intervals until reaching the "100 feet" call. The CSO will state
       altitude deviations in actual feet above or below glideslope (ex. “15 feet above
       glideslope.”) The CSO will state deviations in excess of 150 ft explicitly. The CSO also
       advises the PF if the aircraft is correcting to or diverging from glide-path, using the term
       "Rapidly," if appropriate. The PM and CSO will closely monitor radar altimeters to
       ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL
       minimums. WARNING: Use of a 5 degree glideslope can cause descent rates in excess
       of 1,000 ft per minute. Pilots must take extreme care to break high descent rates with
       application of power prior to touchdown. WARNING: Do not initiate a descent below
       300 ft AGL prior to 2 NM to touchdown. This will cause the glideslope to be excessively
       shallow. NOTE: Do not descend below 300 ft AGL until both pilots visually identify
       the LZ environment. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "zone in sight,” its
       clock position, and any discrepancies (i.e., any lights out, etc.) Both pilots will then
       confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for proper heading.
16.24. Tactical Approaches. Aircrews will conduct tactical approaches (overhead, downwind,
random steep, SCA, and random shallow) IAW the airland operation procedures found in
AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. NOTE: When using other than SCA tactical approaches, the PF will call
“slowdown now” initiating the INFIL/EXFIL BEFORE LANDING checklist.
   16.24.1. NVG Tactical Approaches. Tactical recovery certified pilots may conduct NVG
   tactical approaches to AMP 1, 2, 3 or 4 marked landing zones.
   16.24.2. When performing tactical approaches, adhere to flight manual maneuvering and
   configuration restrictions.

Section 16D—Airdrop Operations

16.25. General. This chapter prescribes HC-130J employment procedures for all airdrop
operations. For additional guidance and information, refer to AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
   16.25.1. Depending on the threat environment, there are generally two airdrop methods
   used; i.e., tactical airdrop and rescue airdrop procedures
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  195


      16.25.1.1. Permissive Environment. The situation will usually allow multiple passes and
      a drop into the wind. In this instance, a jumpmaster (JM) directed pararescue/equipment
      deployment or rescue equipment kit deliveries could be used.
      16.25.1.2. Contested Environment. In a tactical situation where the hostile threat is
      unknown or determined to be a factor, low observability is a requirement. A single pass
      over the objective, with minimum time spent in the drop area at altitude and at slower
      airdrop airspeeds, will reduce vulnerability. The primary method used in this
      environment is automatic release at the computer derived release point.     NOTE: Prior
      to takeoff, the PIC will ensure that all crewmembers have reviewed the emergency
      procedures for the proposed airdrop. NOTE: In the event of a malfunction, incident, or
      off-DZ drop, do not de-rig, handle or move items unless required for safety of flight. Any
      follow-on investigation will benefit from seeing the items in the position or state they
      were in at the time of the event. Drop zone malfunctions and off-DZ drops will be
      reported IAW AFI 13-210 and AFI 13-217 as supplemented.
16.26. Airdrop Altitudes and Airspeeds. Refer to AFI 11-231 for specific airdrop altitudes
and airspeeds.
16.27. Minimum Drop Zones Size. Refer to AFI 13-217.
16.28. Types of Drop Zones. Refer to AFI 13-217.
16.29. Drop Zone Markings. Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217.
16.30. Airdrop Restrictions.
   16.30.1. Airdrop Weather Minimums. Airdrops will be conducted in day or night
   VMC/IMC. EXCEPTION: Only certified and current aircrews are authorized to conduct
   airdrops in IMC.
   16.30.2. Airdrop wind limitations. Refer to AFI 13-217.
   16.30.3. DZ Surveys. The pilots and CSO will review the DZ survey during mission
   planning. CSO will carry a valid DZ survey onboard all flights performing airdrops. NOTE:
   CSO laptop with current DZ database will meet this requirement. EXCEPTION:
   Contingency operations are exempt from this requirement if current DZ survey is not
   available.
   16.30.4. Airdrop Communications Procedures. Radio silence procedures will be coordinated
   prior to mission execution.
   16.30.5. Minimum Enroute Flight Time. Minimum enroute flight time from takeoff to time
   over release point, for drops, will be sufficient to safely accomplish all required checklists.
   For airdrops involving personnel, enroute time of less than 25 minutes must be approved by
   the JM.
   16.30.6. Ballistic Requirements. Crews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which
   AFI 11-231 does not list ballistics unless the user provides approved ballistic data or K
   factor. HQ ACC/A3T, Aeronautical Systems Division or US Army Soldier's System Center
   Natick (ASD/ENFC), and Special Operations Aerial Delivery Element (SOADE) will
   approve the ballistics or K factor. This does not apply to formal test missions where the
   purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load or operational test.

   16.30.7. Airdrop Operations.
       16.30.7.1. The aircraft will not be configured where the cargo ramp and door and the
       paratroop door(s) are open at the same time. EXCEPTION: Authorized LM-directed
       airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to include trail-line drops, while spotting from a single
       open paratroop door.
       16.30.7.2. If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will
       not be used.
       16.30.7.3. A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door.
       A maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever
       winch.
16.31. Airdrop Kits. The LM will carry enough equipment in the airdrop kit to satisfy load or
mission requirements. Minimum contents of airdrop kits will include cloth-backed pressure
sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80 lb cotton webbing, two G-14
clevises, adjustable wrench and four carabiners.
16.32. Joint Airdrop Inspection.
   16.32.1. Joint Airdrop Inspection Records. Unless exempted by AFI 13-210, Joint Airdrop
   Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and Activity Reporting, MAJCOM
   supplements or waivers, a DD Form 1748 will be accomplished prior to all equipment
   airdrops. Completion, retention, and disposition of the form(s) will be in accordance with
   AFI 13-210, as supplemented. A-7A and A-21 containers rigged as door bundles do not
   require a before loading or after loading inspection. The JM of the airdrop unit and the LM
   will perform an inspection to ensure the A-7A and A-21 containers are properly rigged for
   either breakaway or nonbreakaway (IAW FM 3–21.220), connection to aircraft equipment,
   and clear route of exit. NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series TOs, Army Field
   Manuals, or Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 350-series manuals require a waiver
   from U.S. Army Quartermaster, Ft Lee, VA. Channel waiver requests through HQ
   ACC/A3TV. EXCEPTION: Waivers are not required for resupply, parabundles, and
   equipment described in this volume.
   16.32.2. If airdrop and airland loads are carried at the same time, see the restrictions listed in
   Table 16.4. These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads from interfering with
   airdrop rigging equipment.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            197

7. Access to operate airdrop equipment                                   Troop Seats not used 1L and 2L
NOTES:
(1) Personnel airdrops may be performed with only one troop door configured for airdrop with user
concurrence.

(2) Will not exceed 80” with 12” either side of retriever cable. Height of cargo outside of the 12” left and
right (total 24”) may exceed the 80” height limitation, but will not interfere with overhead rigging
equipment.

(3) CDS and heavy equipment configuration. A maximum of three rows of nylon seats may be used. The
remaining vacant row serves as a safety aisle. All sidewall seats will be raised or stowed in the wheel
well area when airland pallets and vehicles are located within this area and exceed 96” width.
16.33. Verification Of and Marking Airdrop Loads. The CSO will verify with the LM the
actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of loads
in the aircraft agree with planned CARP data. If an individual load has a different type or number
of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will land on
the DZ. Base drop altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude. For training missions,
the LM will coordinate with the CSO to ensure all equipment, drogues, containers, and standard
airdrop training bundles are marked with the aircraft call sign and date. If more than one load is
dropped on the same pass, mark loads with order of exit from aircraft. Markings will be placed
on the extracted end of the load, and on the drogue line. EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS
bundle is dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container out.       NOTE: Contingency
loads will not be marked.
16.34. Safety Equipment. During Airdrops, all personnel in the cargo compartment will be
seated with their seat belt fastened. Crewmembers will wear a restraint harness/parachute,
helmet, and eye protection when performing duties near an open exit in flight. WARNING:
Crewmembers must wear a restraint harness when performing duties near an open exit above
14,000 ft MSL or below 800 ft AGL.      WARNING: Except for an actual contingency, towed
trooper, or emergency that threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint
 198                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that would allow the LM to fall outside
the aircraft.
   16.34.1. When used, fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline before flight as follows:
       16.34.1.1. Connect and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that will preclude the
       wearer from exiting an aircraft.
       16.34.1.2. Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable
       provided no static lines are attached and an anchor cable stop is positioned and taped at
       FS 737. The center anchor cable support may be used in lieu of the stop if lowered. Do
       not use this configuration(s) if both paratroop doors are open at the same time. Instead,
       connect and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that would preclude the wearer
       from exiting either exit.
       16.34.1.3. Connect the lifeline when at, or anticipating movement aft of FS 677.
       16.34.1.4. The onboard safety personnel will normally provide their own parachute.
       Alternately, at their discretion, they may use a restraint harness. Personnel required to be
       mobile will wear a restraint harness, or wear a parachute before doors are opened.
       EXCEPTION: Flight examiner LMs are exempt from wearing a parachute or restraint
       harness while conducting flight evaluations provided they do not go aft of FS 677. For
       static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before doors are opened.
       EXCEPTION: Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes (racetracks) may stand and hook
       up with doors open if they are forward of the aft edge of the wheel wells FS 617.
       NOTE: Do not use flight deck restraint harness for airdrops.
   16.34.2. For use of LPUs refer to paragraph 6.24.5
16.35. Airdrop Flight Procedures.
   16.35.1. Airdrop Checklists. Airdrop checklists are located in the TO 1C-130(H)J-
   1.Checklists may be compressed or completed early if mission requirements dictate.
   Normally, all items of the preceding checklist are to be accomplished prior to initiating the
   next checklist. Avoid the use of the word “GREEN” or “LIGHT” after initiation of the
   slowdown checklist until arriving at the release point.
   16.35.2. The LM will open and close the ramp and door unless otherwise briefed.
   16.35.3. Aircrew No Drop Decisions.
       16.35.3.1. Prior to the “1-MINUTE” call, any crewmember who determines a condition
       exists that could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the PIC. A “NO DROP” will be called
       at the discretion of the PIC.
       16.35.3.2. After the “1-MINUTE” call, any crewmember observing a condition that
       would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit “NO DROP” on interphone. The PM and LM
       will immediately acknowledge the “NO DROP” call. The LM will accomplish the
       applicable no drop procedures before performing the COMPLETION OF DROP
       checklist. The PIC must ensure the crew is aware of what the plan is in the event of a no
       drop (race track, alternate DZ, RTB, etc.) and instruct the crew to follow the appropriate
       procedures.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  199


      16.35.3.3. Checklists may still be in progress after the “ONE MINUTE WARNING.”
      Call “NO DROP” if all checklists are not completed by the “5 SECOND” call.
      16.35.3.4. If a “NO DROP” is called after the load restraint is removed and a racetrack is
      not planned, restraint will be reapplied.
   16.35.4. Departure from Drop Zone (Escape). The PM/CSO will call "RED LIGHT" at the
   expiration of the "GREEN LIGHT" time or upon hearing the LM’s call of "LOAD CLEAR,"
   whichever occurs first.
      16.35.4.1. When the red light is turned on, immediately begin the escape maneuver by
      tracking flaps if required, turning to the departure heading, increase airspeed as required,
      and attain enroute altitude.
      16.35.4.2. Accelerate as required, climb or descend as briefed, and perform the
      COMPLETION OF DROP checklist. NOTE: During combat, static lines that cannot
      be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed. Close all doors, raise flaps, and
      accelerate to enroute airspeed. It is imperative that the aircraft be configured for high
      speed evasive maneuvers. Therefore, after the static lines have been retrieved or cut, the
      doors and air deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder of the COMPLETION OF
      DROP checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time.
   16.35.5. Multiple Passes (Racetrack). Multiple passes will not be made unless directed or
   previously agreed upon by all units involved. If multiple passes are flown, all airdrop
   checklists will be accomplished. Checklists may be compressed during racetracks, but the
   aircraft commander must ensure the LM has adequate time to complete all items before the
   drop is initiated. The One Minute Warning is never compressed and is always given on time.
   EXCEPTION: During pilot directed airdrops, the checklist may be initiated at a point
   commensurate with the available time and type of drop. Doors may remain open at the
   discretion of the PIC.
16.36. Navigation Accuracy.
   16.36.1. To provide an early indication of degraded navigation accuracy, set the POS
   ALERT(s) at 0.03 NM (55 yards; FOM 2) and 0.05 NM (110 yards; FOM 4). If both INAV
   solution FOM's are less than or equal to 4 and no POS ALERTS (INAV Pos Miscompare
   ACAWS/INAV Pos Difference ACAWS) are indicated, navigation airdrop accuracy (300 yd
   CEP) is verified. If these conditions are not met a radar or visual update is necessary to
   verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to performing airdrops.      NOTE: Anytime a
   position bias (update) has been added to the EGI INAV solution, displayed FOM values do
   not reflect the result of the bias.
   16.36.2. For all airdrops, verify navigation accuracy within 10 minutes of slowdown. Do not
   continue an airdrop without verifying the active ship solution if any of the following
   conditions exists: either FOM greater than 4, INAV Pos Miscompare ACAWS, or INAV Pos
   Difference ACAWS.
16.37. Methods of Aerial Delivery.
   16.37.1. The primary method of aerial delivery for the HC-130J is automatic release at the
   computer derived release point. See paragraph 16.36 for navigation system accuracy
   requirements. See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for additional guidance on methods of aerial delivery.
 200                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   16.37.2. PM and CSO will verify DZ point of impact coordinates in the mission computer
   and CNI-MU CARP information with a valid DZ survey. Refer to AFI 13-217 for DZ survey
   information/requirements/applicability.
   16.37.3. Airdrops are not allowed if a CARP XTK or CARP VERT is displayed. During
   contingency operations, the ERQS/CC or equivalent may approve manual drops (pushing
   green light switch based on visual reference to PI only) for increased flexibility of PI
   placement. EXCEPTION: Continuing an airdrop with CARP XTK displayed or performing
   a manual drop is permissible for alternate airdrop methods.
16.38. Low Altitude Airdrop Positioning (Visual). The following are approved methods of
positioning the aircraft on a final for low level visual airdrops.
   16.38.1. Computed Air Release Point (CARP) Aerial Delivery. The computed air release
   point (CARP) is a mathematical computation based on average parachute ballistics and dead
   reckoning principles. After computing the CARP solution, the CSO plots it on an
   appropriately scaled chart, sketch, diagram, or aerial photograph. Detailed instructions for
   CARP computations and depictions are contained in AFI 11-231.           NOTE: Accurate visual
   positioning of the aircraft over the release point is the major difficulty of the CARP system.
   Make corrections to the aircraft track as far out from the CARP as possible to minimize this
   deficiency. To achieve desired drop accuracy, maintain the track during the final approach to
   the CARP and throughout the drop (green light) time.
   16.38.2. Pilot/LM Directed Airdrops. Pilot and LMs may direct certain specialized rescue
   equipment and freefall equipment deliveries IAW this chapter and AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.
   16.38.3. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). Airdrops may be made using the visual
   ground marked release system (GMRS). In this system, supported ground forces are
   responsible for computing a release point and providing ground markings (panels or lights).
   The airdrop will be made directly over this marker or abeam a flank marker as determined
   during joint planning. Aircrew procedures are the same as those employed during a standard
   drop except that a pilot may assume the responsibility for calling "5 seconds" and "green
   light." An in-flight CARP will be computed to predict the approximate location of the release
   point and facilitate initial line-up during the run-in to the DZ. See AFI 13-217 for markings.
   NOTE: The user assumes responsibility for airdrop accuracy during GMRS drops.
   16.38.4. Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS). VIRS is an airdrop method by which
   ground personnel provide verbal steering guidance to an aircraft and call the release when the
   aircraft arrives over a predetermined point on the ground. VIRS will only be performed by
   qualified and properly trained personnel IAW AFI 13-217.
       16.38.4.1. When this option is selected:
          16.38.4.1.1. The ground party will compute the release point.
          16.38.4.1.2. The ground party will position on the intended release point, provide the
          aircrew with verbal steering guidance and call the release when the aircraft reaches
          the release point.
          16.38.4.1.3. The ground party should use the following terminology:
              16.38.4.1.3.1. "Turn left or right" (directs approximately a half standard rate turn
              unless specified otherwise.)
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  201


             16.38.4.1.3.2. "Stop turn" (self-explanatory.)
             16.38.4.1.3.3. "Standby" (indicates approximately five seconds prior to the
             release point.)
             16.38.4.1.3.4. "Execute, execute, execute" (directs release of the load.)
         16.38.4.1.4. Upon hearing the term "standby", the CSO will state "5 seconds" on the
         interphone. On the first "execute," the CSO will state "green light."
         16.38.4.1.5. The authentication procedures to be employed will be briefed prior to
         the mission. The procedure should be as simple and short as possible so as not to
         interfere with the approach to the DZ. Based on the limitations of radio equipment
         and terrain, a point will be identified as far out on the approach as possible where
         contact should be first attempted for authentication.
         16.38.4.1.6. The ground party must maintain positive visual contact with the aircraft
         at all times during the inbound approach. If, in a training situation, doubt exists that
         the airdrop can be safely executed, or if the DZ cannot be positively identified by the
         aircrew, a no drop will be called by either the ground party or the aircrew.
  16.38.5. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Airdrops. JMD airdrops require OG/CC or higher
  approval. EXCEPTION: Unilateral PJ airdrops for continuation training. These drops may
  be performed by qualified AF or sister service JMs (or trainees under the supervision of
  qualified personnel), may direct the aircraft to a release point and determine the exit point
  IAW the following restrictions and procedures:
     16.38.5.1. JMD airdrops will be conducted using the SEARCH AND RESCUE
     checklists in AFI 11-2HC-130J Vol 3 Attachment 2.
     16.38.5.2. Airdrop personnel in VMC only.           NOTE: For PJ JMD airdrops of
     ATV/RAMZ packages, crews will use SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists and either a
     Fixed, Moving, or Crosswind Target Pattern for deployment.
     16.38.5.3. The JM parent service/user accepts all responsibility for the accuracy of the
     drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment.
     16.38.5.4. In-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures between the
     JM, LM, and pilots will be coordinated prior to takeoff.
     16.38.5.5. HALO and HAHO operations may be conducted using JMD procedures.
     16.38.5.6. Personnel will not exit the aircraft unless the green light is illuminated.
     16.38.5.7. The CSO will still calculate a CARP/HARP for mission planning purposes.
     CNI-MU calculated CARP/HARPs will be used to back up the computations and in-flight
     directions given by the JM. Prior to flight, the aircrew and the JM will compare predicted
     release points, resolve any significant differences, and agree to a planned slowdown point
     or time. CSO will update the JM in-flight on actual wind information and any changes to
     the crew’s preflight CARP/HARP location.
     16.38.5.8. Standard Voice Terminology. When the JM provides assistance on final
     approach, use the following standard voice terminology:
         16.38.5.8.1. "Steady" (present course is satisfactory.)
202                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         16.38.5.8.2. "Right" (change direction to the right 5 degrees.)
         16.38.5.8.3. "Left" (change direction to the left 5 degrees.)
         16.38.5.8.4. "Right or left __ degrees" (change direction as indicated.) This direction
         will be utilized when directional changes in excess of 5 degrees are desired.
         16.38.5.8.5. "No-drop" (no-drop will be called for unsafe or unknown conditions or
         unsatisfactory positioning over the target.)
         16.38.5.8.6. "Load Clear" (jumpers or cargo bundles have cleared the aircraft and the
         PF is clear to make a turn to begin the next pass and/or observe results of the drop just
         accomplished.)
         16.38.5.8.7. Hand Signals. The JM may use the following hand signals to relay
         course corrections through the safety man: Thumb left/right, indicating 5-degree
         correction; and palm open, fingers pointed toward the cockpit, indicating steady.
      16.38.5.9. Deployment Procedures.
         16.38.5.9.1. No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the LM will allow the
         JM access to the door to begin the "spotting procedures." JM duties can be performed
         from any position in either paratroop door or the ramp and door; however, it is
         recommended that the JM use the right door for right-hand patterns and the left door
         for left-hand patterns. The JM, when wearing a parachute, will connect the static line
         to the anchor cable designated for use. When wearing an adjusted restraint harness,
         the JM will connect to the personnel restraint system or to a tie-down ring that would
         preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. The JM visually relays steering signals
         to the LM, who verbally relays this information to the PF.          WARNING: The
         paratroop door(s) and the cargo ramp and door will not be opened at the same time.
         EXCEPTION: Authorized LM-directed airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to include
         trail-line drops, while spotting from a single open paratroop door.
         16.38.5.9.2. Once safety checks are complete, and the pilot determines that all
         conditions are favorable for deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point,
         the pilot states "CLEAR TO JUMP" and the PM will turn on the green light. Jumpers
         will exit the aircraft upon reaching the JMs identified release point. NOTE: The
         aircrew may turn on the green light once the drop zone has been positively identified,
         but no earlier than 1 minute prior to the release point for freefall operations, or 30
         seconds for static line operations. If at any time exit of jumpers becomes unsafe
         (aircraft emergency or similar circumstances), the aircrew will turn on the red light
         and the LM will direct the JM to stop remaining parachutists.
      16.38.5.10. After all jumpers have exited; the LM will call “LOAD CLEAR.” At this
      point the PM will turn on the red light.
      16.38.5.11. Aircrew No Drop Decision. If the crew believes the drop will occur outside
      of safe parameters, the words "NO DROP" announced over the interphone by any person
      after the CSO’s " CREW, 1-MINUTE WARNING " call will terminate deployment
      procedures until the situation is resolved. Upon hearing a "NO DROP" call, the PM will
      turn the red light on, and the PM and the LM will acknowledge the “NO DROP.”
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    203


      16.38.5.12. Mixed Procedures. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of
      airdrop method (e.g., GMRS, VIRS) or standard CARP/HARP drops. When JMD drop
      procedures are used, the crew will follow the JM‘s instructions, while adhering to normal
      safety concerns.
16.39. Water DZs. Water drops can be conducted on marked or unmarked DZs. Refer to AFI
13-217 for further guidance.
16.40. Pararescue JMD Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target Patterns. For PJ JMD
airdrops of ATV/RAMZ/ARC/CRL packages, Pararescue Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target
Patterns will be used running the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists. These procedures may be
used for JMD pararescue personnel only drops. Comply with the applicable guidance in
paragraphs 16.38.5, 16.39, 16.41.
   16.40.1. Pre-Deployment Evaluation. In a permissive environment, evaluation of the landing
   surface and surrounding obstructions should be accomplished by observation passes.
   Evaluation of the weather should include existing and forecast temperatures, wind direction,
   precipitation, cloud cover, fog, visibility, etc. Wind velocity evaluation will include
   consideration of direction, gusts, and wind shear. The crew should keep the JM advised of
   current mean altitude winds. The presence of rocks or stumps may impose a lower maximum
   velocity while the presence of trees, unfrozen tundra, or soft snow might permit safe jumping
   at higher velocities.
   16.40.2. General. Pararescuemen (PJ) wearing static line parachutes will normally deploy
   through a single paratroop door or off the cargo ramp (tailgate). The parachute static lines
   will be connected to the anchor cable on the same side the static line retriever is installed. No
   more than 20 parachutists may exit on a single pass using the long cable either from the
   paratroop door or off the ramp. Streamer/spotter chutes will be used prior to JMD PJ
   deployments using Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target
   deployment patterns.
      16.40.2.1. Streamers are 20-ft lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end. The spotter
      chute used is the standard J-1 (12 ft diameter) wind drift determination parachute. The
      spotter chute weight can be provided by the PJ or a MK-6 Mod 3 smoke. When the MK-6
      Mod 3 is used, the JM will signal the safetyman/LM when to launch the smoke.
      Immediately upon receiving the signal, the safetyman/LM will simultaneously activate
      and launch the smoke.
      16.40.2.2. The safetyman/LM will assist the JM in launching the streamer/spotter chute
      and will remain at the door during PJ deployments. The JM, pilot, and CSO will confirm
      the exit point prior to release. NOTE: For low altitude JMD PJ drops, a CARP is not
      required when using streamers/spotter chutes.     WARNING: During paratroop door
      static line personnel drops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the
      center anchor cable supports (A- frame, FS 737.)
   16.40.3. Deployment Pattern. The normal flight pattern will be a racetrack pattern, with the
   final approach from spotting device to target.      NOTE: See AFI 11-231 for detailed
   guidance on Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target deployment
   patterns.
204                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      16.40.3.1. The pattern will be large enough to allow for heading corrections on final
      approach. The crosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after the spotting device or
      jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target area remain in sight at all times.
      16.40.3.2. The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern.
      16.40.3.3. Aircraft Configuration.
         16.40.3.3.1. Deployment airspeed is 125 KIAS.
         16.40.3.3.2. Set flaps to 50% below 140,000 lbs and 70% at or above 140,000 lbs. If
         use of CDS flap setting is desired, perform an automatic release at the computer
         derived release point using the CDS checklist. NOTE: Pararescuemen will not be
         deployed from aircraft with gross weights greater than 155,000 lbs.  NOTE: Static
         line deployments at airspeeds above 130 KIAS are prohibited due to parachute
         limitations.
      16.40.3.4. The JM must be kept advised of the position of the aircraft in the pattern and
      the PIC must be kept informed of the activities in the rear of the aircraft.
  16.40.4. Deployment Procedures. In addition to the deployment procedures listed in
  paragraph 16.38.5.9, the following procedures apply:
      16.40.4.1. Leave the red light on for dry passes and streamer/spotter chute patterns.
      16.40.4.2. On final for live drops, the pilot will make a "CREW, 1-MINUTE
      WARNING" call, WARNING: For the confined lake or near shore water drops of PJ
      personnel or RAMZ training, do not call “CREW, 1-MINUTE WARNING” until over
      water. Call “NO DROP” if the exit point for the RAMZ will be over land. NOTE: The
      deployment pattern may be flown on autopilot
  16.40.5. Post-Deployment. Maintain visual or radio contact with the pararescue team and
  maintain surveillance of the area for possible natural or man-made hazards. After pararescue
  deployment, the PIC will notify the appropriate agencies to ensure required team support is
  provided. Every effort will be expended to ensure that the pararescue team is covered by
  rescue aircraft until the party is assured of surface assistance. Surface assistance for land
  operation is not required as long as sufficient supplies are available. Prior to departure of the
  aircraft from the incident site, resupply schedules, communication schedules, supply
  requirements, and planned actions of the pararescue team will be established by the aircraft
  commander and team leader.
      16.40.5.1. Primary and alternate frequencies, schedules, and an alternate method of
      communication will be established by the mission commander and will be included in the
      mission commander’s pre-mission brief.
      16.40.5.2. If practicable, the pararescuemen will immediately establish radio contact
      with the drop aircraft upon penetration of the incident site. The team leader will verify the
      predetermined schedule for the next radio contact before the drop aircraft departs the
      area.
      16.40.5.3. In the event the PJ team fails to establish communication at the initial pre-
      briefed time, maximum effort will be made on the next check or the alternate schedule
      until radio contact is established.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      205


       16.40.5.4. If communication cannot be established through the procedures outlined
       above, any other method of communication may be used to relay information to the
       rescue team.
       16.40.5.5. Radio will be used as the primary method of communication. The MK 13
       day/night flares will be the alternate method. When signals for special purposes are
       needed, they may be locally devised.
16.41. Pararescue Deployments to Ships. Many factors affect the decision to deploy PJs to
ships at sea, precluding the establishment of a single procedure that will apply to all situations. In
all cases, thorough preplanning and coordination with the recovery vessel is vital to a safe and
successful operation. The following will provide guidelines and considerations:
   16.41.1. In sea conditions other than calm, it is essential the ship have a motorized launch in
   the water prior to team deployment, unless the PJ team deploys with a RAMZ watercraft.
   WARNING: The aircrew will prepare an MA-1 sea rescue kit for deployment from the
   cargo ramp as soon as practical following an open water PJ deployment (not required for
   training).
       16.41.1.1. Positioning and maneuvering of the ship, motorized launch, and deployment
       of the MA-1 kit is the ship captain’s decision. When possible, the PIC should advise the
       ship captain on positioning and maneuvering prior to deployment. The crew should
       determine whether the ship can remain still in the water, whether the ship will be steered
       into the wind or crosswind, and where the launch will be positioned.
       16.41.1.2. The rescue aircraft should deploy the pararescue team to the motorized
       launch. The launch should maintain its position during the deployment pattern.
       WARNING: The crew will make every effort to advise the ship to shut down its
       propellers anytime a pararescuemen is in the water alongside it.
       16.41.1.3. In the case that a decision is made to deploy the team without the use of a
       motorized launch, it is critical that the method of boarding is verified prior to
       deployment.
16.42. High Altitude Airdrop Requirements. Airdrops conducted above 3,000 ft AGL are
considered high altitude drops. EXCEPTION: RAMZ airdrops at or below 3,500 ft AGL are
considered low altitude drops. PSYOPS are governed by paragraph 16.44.         NOTE: Only
essential personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI
11-403 are permitted on mission aircraft for airdrops above 10,000 ft MSL.
   16.42.1. A continuous supply of 100% oxygen will be used by all personnel during
   unpressurized operations above 10,000 ft MSL IAW AFI 11-409. Crewmembers will follow
   established MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements.
   16.42.2. The JM may dictate the use of supplemental oxygen by any or all jumpers at
   altitudes less than those listed. Parachutists transfer from the aircraft oxygen system or
   portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately 1 minute before green
   light.
   16.42.3. High Altitude Emergency Procedures. If a physiological incident occurs, the PIC
   will:
       16.42.3.1. Abort the mission.
206                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      16.42.3.2. Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and
      degree of sickness or pain).
      16.42.3.3. Ensure the affected person remains on 100% oxygen until a medical doctor
      determines the type of treatment required.
      16.42.3.4. Proceed to the nearest base with qualified medical assistance available.
      16.42.3.5. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the
      aircraft.
  16.42.4. High Altitude Mission Requirements
      16.42.4.1. A pre-mission HARP solution will be calculated based on preflight weather
      and winds.
      16.42.4.2. Briefings. Aircrew will ensure all aspects of HALO/HAHO airdrops are
      discussed in detail at the Pilot-Jumpmaster and CSO-Jumpmaster briefings. Use the pilot-
      jumpmaster and CSO-jumpmaster briefing guides found in AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 CL-1.
      16.42.4.3. For all HALO/HAHO operations, CSO will provide the JM with a magnetic
      course +/- 5 degrees and a distance (NM, km, or meters) from the release point to the
      drop zone.
      16.42.4.4. CSO will compare their HARP location and calculations with the JM chart
      and calculations.
      16.42.4.5. In-flight changes to the HARP location or significant wind changes will be
      relayed to the JM as soon as possible.
      16.42.4.6. The CNI-MU winds may be used to update preflight HARP winds and to
      determine and update the winds at altitude.
      16.42.4.7. The I-NAV course guidance will be used to properly align the aircraft on the
      inbound course.
      16.42.4.8. All available navigation aids may be used to assist in locating the HARP but
      will not be relied on as the sole means for release.      NOTE: For HALO, positive
      identification of the drop zone area must be confirmed electronically or visually prior to
      calling the release.
      16.42.4.9. Low level flight to the target area with a climb is most desirable for HALO or
      HAHO operations. This will enable the CSO to obtain current winds for updating the
      HARP. High level flights are also possible but the HARP will have to be based on
      external sources. The release may be accomplished visually.
  16.42.5. High Altitude Drop Procedures. The CSO will compute a high altitude release point
  (HARP) solution for all HALO or HAHO drops unless specific mission directives dictate
  otherwise. Use the PERSONNEL checklist. NOTE: HALO or HAHO drops may be JMD.
  Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklist.
      16.42.5.1. Pressurization Scheduling. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 ft until
      the Twenty Minute Warning and until prebreathing is complete. Have cabin altitude
      equal to the ambient pressure prior to completion of the Ten Minute Warning.
      Pressurizing after the drop will be IAW mission requirements; normally, the cabin
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  207


      altitude should return to 10,000 ft or below as soon as possible. If any jumpers are still
      onboard, ensure the parachutes automated actuation devices are disabled prior to
      descending or pressurizing.
      16.42.5.2. Drop Configuration.
          16.42.5.2.1. Flaps. Normal configuration is with 50% flaps. However, at high
          altitudes, it may be desirable to use less flaps.
          16.42.5.2.2. Airspeed. The JM will be briefed on the airspeed used.
          16.42.5.2.3. Altitude. Pressure or indicated altitude will be used as the airdrop
          altitude reference.
          16.42.5.2.4. Exits.
              16.42.5.2.4.1. Parachutists will normally exit from the cargo door and ramp. All
              parachutists, with the exception of the JM, will stand forward of the ramp hinge
              until the One-Minute Warning.
              16.42.5.2.4.2. A paratroop door may be used in lieu of the cargo door and ramp.
              When this is the case, air deflector doors will be opened. All parachutists, except
              JM, will stand forward of the paratroop door until the One Minute Warning.
              NOTE: Jump platforms must be installed. NOTE: All parachutists, including
              JM, will exit the aircraft during the green light time.
      16.42.5.3. Communications and Signals. The LM will coordinate the following hand
      signals with the JM.
          16.42.5.3.1. Time warnings (20, 10, 6, 2, and 1-minute) may be given to the
          parachutists by the LM pointing at a watch and then indicating with fingers the
          correct warning.
          16.42.5.3.2. The velocity of winds on the DZ will be given by the LM by cupping
          one hand and blowing into it, then indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the
          wind.
          16.42.5.3.3. A no drop will be indicated by passing a hand across the throat.
          16.42.5.3.4. LMs will have pencil and paper available during airdrops for use in
          communicating with parachutists.
16.43. Emergency Parachutist Bailout.
   16.43.1. Maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the parachutists to evacuate the
   aircraft. The minimum acceptable altitude is 400 ft AGL for static line deployments and
   1,000 ft AGL for personnel freefall deployments. If the jump must be made at airspeed in
   excess of 150 KIAS, advise parachutists of the airspeed and altitude.
   16.43.2. If conditions are unsuitable for aircraft evacuation, turn the red light on until exit
   doors are closed. The PIC advises the JM through the LM to have the parachutists unhook,
   take their seats, and fasten seatbelts.
 208                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


16.44. PSYOPS Drops (Leaflets)
   16.44.1. PSYOPS Drops (Leaflets). Airdrop and dispersal of large quantities of printed
   materials is possible using prepackaged leaflets. Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to
   the aircraft service ceiling. Use high altitude oxygen requirements as specified in Table 16.5.
   Drops require the movement of boxes of various weights from throughout the cargo
   compartment via intermediate rollers (if required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp.
   For additional guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 Chapter 8.
       16.44.1.1. Equipment. In addition to normal aircraft equipment, the following items may
       be required to perform leaflet drops:
          16.44.1.1.1. Parachutes or restraining harnesses must be available for use by all
          personnel working in the cargo compartment.
          16.44.1.1.2. A portable oxygen console with a minimum of four regulators and
          output hoses of sufficient length to reach through the entire cargo compartment must
          be available for high altitude airdrops (above 10,000 ft.)
          16.44.1.1.3. An interval timer is desirable (alternating red and green jump lights may
          serve for sequencing the drops). WARNING: Aircrew members will not be exposed
          to 30,000 ft MSL more than three times per 7 days and must have a minimum of 24
          hours between exposures. NOTE: Long duration high altitude drops will require the
          aircraft remain open. Consider outside air temperature and clothing requirements
          prior to step.
       16.44.1.2. Aircrew Procedures. Use the LEAFLET AIRDROP checklist. Under normal
       circumstances the crew required for leaflet operations consists of a tactical crew plus two
       PTs (for high altitude airdrops) and three additional crew members to act as feeders. The
       primary LM will assign specific positions for activity in the cargo compartment.
          16.44.1.2.1. Drop Configuration/Maneuvering. Configuration is based on desired
          coverage and airframe airspeed limitations. All personnel should be constantly aware
          of the possibility of an emergency break upon encountering a threat.
              16.44.1.2.1.1. Flaps. Flaps are normally set at 50% and flap settings should not
              be changed during the drop unless the LM is notified.
              16.44.1.2.1.2. Airspeed. Base indicated airspeed on desired groundspeed. This
              may range from 130 KIAS to 150 KIAS. Other speed ranges may apply if not
              dropping off of the ramp (i.e., cargo door only).
              16.44.1.2.1.3. Static Lines. To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile
              threat is detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be
              stowed after each box goes out. Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe
              operation. Static lines may be cut in an emergency.
16.45. Specific Airdrop Information. For additional information about airdrops to include
airdrops not covered in this section see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 Chapters 8 and 9.
   16.45.1. Personnel Airdrops.
       16.45.1.1. LMs will ensure JMs receive all time advisories, wind updates, and no-drop
       decisions when passed.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                209


     16.45.1.2. Air deflectors must be operational if paratroop doors are used. If an air
     deflector does not extend, do not open the affected troop door.
     16.45.1.3. LMs will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable
     supports (A-Frame, FS 737) in case of anchor cable or support mounting failure.
     16.45.1.4. Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control.
        16.45.1.4.1. At completion of the Slowdown Checklist, the LM will allow the JM
        access to the paratroop door or ramp no later than (NLT) 1 minute prior to jump.
        16.45.1.4.2. For JM-directed airdrops using the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists,
        after Pre-Deployment checks are complete, the LM will allow the JM access to
        paratroop door or ramp NLT 2 minutes prior to the jump.
        16.45.1.4.3. The LM will then take position in such a manner as to provide maximum
        maneuverability for the JM and safety NCOs to perform their duties, and to prevent
        interference with exiting jumpers. Upon seeing the red jump lights illuminate, the LM
        will notify the JM or safety personnel of the red light condition. The LM will take no
        further action to stop any of the remaining parachutists. The LM will count (if
        possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.
        16.45.1.4.4. Control of the paratroop door/cargo ramp will revert back to the LM
        after all parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the
        JM or safety NCO and cleared from the paratroop door/cargo ramp area.
        16.45.1.4.5. For multiple passes (i.e., racetracks), after assuming control of the
        paratroop door/cargo ramp from the JM, the LM(s) will maintain control of the
        doors/cargo ramp until completion of subsequent Slowdown Checklists.
        WARNING: Do not attempt to physically stop or hinder jumpers from exiting the
        aircraft if jumpers continue to exit after "red light". WARNING: During airdrops,
        personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports
        (A-frame, FS 737). Ensure all personnel aft of FS 677 are secured to the aircraft or
        have a static line connected prior to opening the ramp and door/troop door.
        HALO/HAHO personnel must be configured and ready to jump.
     16.45.1.5. Fouled Parachutist Procedures. The JM or safety is responsible to observe the
     fouled parachutist and recommend whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. If all
     parachutists have exited and there is no JM on board, this responsibility rests with the
     LM. The recommendation is relayed, by the LM, to the PIC who makes the final decision
     whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. The LM will initiate retrieval or cut the
     parachutist‘s static line on the pilot‘s command. When a parachutist is observed to be
     fouled during a paratroop door exit, the first priority is to retrieve, regardless if the
     parachutist is conscious or unconscious. If the parachutist cannot be retrieved and
     indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be cut free. For a tailgate exit, the first
     priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates consciousness. If the
     parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that
     prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
        16.45.1.5.1. The JM stops remaining parachutists and the LM notifies the pilot of a
        fouled parachutist.
210                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         16.45.1.5.2. Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist, the PF should lower the
         landing gear and configure the aircraft flap setting to 100% flaps (paratroop door
         exits only). WARNING: If a parachutist becomes fouled during missions when the
         aircraft is operating with a high gross weight or is flying in a high density altitude
         environment, the PF may elect to maintain flaps at 50%, landing gear up, and slow to
         the slowest practical airspeed in lieu of the standard procedure.    WARNING: The
         PF should maintain approximately 5 knots above the Vs caret in the HUD, or the red
         and white diagonally striped airspeed scale of the PFD, for a margin of safety.
         16.45.1.5.3. The PF maintains at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type
         parachute being used, and avoids flying over or upwind of water or built up areas.
         EXCEPTION: If the parachutist is equipped for a water drop, the PF should avoid
         flying over land.     WARNING: If possible, the PF will avoid turning the aircraft in
         the direction of the fouled parachutist. Turning into the parachutist often starts violent
         swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possibility of injury to the fouled
         parachutist.
         16.45.1.5.4. The PM turns on the red light.
         16.45.1.5.5. The parachutist indicates consciousness and that the reserve parachute is
         ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve parachute.
         16.45.1.5.6. If the PIC’s decision is to cut the parachutist free, the parachutist‘s static
         line will be cut by the LM on the PIC’s command.
  16.45.2. Combination Airdrops. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit
  from the aircraft ramp after the deployment of an airdrop load. When tailgating parachutists,
  the drop altitude is determined by the item requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-
  231. If an additional pass is required to drop all the personnel after a combination CDS drop,
  close the ramp and door and re-rig the static line retriever cable as depicted in TO 1C-
  130(H)J-9.
  16.45.3. Heavy Equipment (HE) Airdrops. Towplate is the primary method of HE airdrop.
  However, crews will be thoroughly familiar with both towplate and non-towplate procedures.
  Only equipment rigged in accordance with 13-C series T.O.s or JSOC 350 series may be
  airdropped. The maximum airdrop load to be extracted over the ramp is 42,000 lbs. The
  aerial delivery unit supporting the load movement ensures current publications are available
  for LM reference during joint inspections.
  16.45.4. Door Bundle Airdrops
      16.45.4.1. General A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 lbs (excluding the
      weight of the parachutes) are referred to as "door bundles" and are dropped from the
      aircraft through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the PERSONNEL/CRL or
      SEARCH AND RESCUE checklist. Loads weighing more than 350 lbs require two
      trained designated pushers to assist the LM/JM in pushing loads from the aircraft. Door
      bundles may be dropped independently or with personnel and are limited to one bundle
      per exit used. When dropped with personnel, the bundle is the first object to exit the
      aircraft. Remove restraints and position the bundle in the paratroop door or on the ramp
      prior to completion of the slowdown checklist (EXCEPTION: If the JM needs the
      paratroop door for spotting, place the door bundle as close as possible to the paratroop
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                211


     door). If jumpers are to follow the door bundle, the user is responsible for ejecting the
     bundle out the troop door or off the ramp. Maintain positive control of all door bundles
     exiting out the cargo ramp. To maintain positive control of door bundles exiting over the
     ramp, it may be necessary to secure the forward end of the bundle to a suitable floor
     tiedown ring with 550 cord or suitable substitute. This tie is to prevent premature release
     of the bundle and will be cut by the LM at the release point.
        16.45.4.1.1. Door bundles dropped from the paratroop doors will be rigged with non-
        breakaway static lines. The dimensions, including the parachute, must not exceed 48
        inches by 30 inches by 66 inches unless authorized in a specific T.O. When the
        container is placed in the door for airdrop, place the largest dimension in the vertical
        or upright position.
        16.45.4.1.2. Door bundles followed by paratroopers dropped from the ramp and door
        or paratroop door(s) will be rigged with a T-10 parachute (converted for cargo) or
        parachute equipped with breakaway static lines (per TO 13C7-1-11). Also, bundles
        rigged for a ramp exit are equipped with a skid board compatible with the center
        roller conveyors.     NOTE: If no parachutists are to be dropped after the door
        bundles, non-breakaway static lines will be used. Anchor cable stops will be
        positioned as depicted in TO 1C-130(H)J-9 for CDS airdrops.
     16.45.4.2. During unilateral single-ship airdrop training, door bundles will not exit the
     aircraft after a paratrooper has jumped.       NOTE: During joint training, a combat or
     contingency operation, the user determines door bundle requirements and order of exit
     from any or all personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation.
     16.45.4.3. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP for the
     first paratrooper exiting after the bundle and compute an additional CARP for the door
     bundle to ensure that it will impact on the DZ. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP,
     followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is the only
     object dropped, base the CARP on the bundle.
  16.45.5. Container Ramp Load(CRL)/Ramp Bundle.
     16.45.5.1. CRL/Ramp Bundle. CRLs may consist of A-series containers (e.g. double A-
     22 or single A-22) or loads rigged on combat expendable platforms (e.g. ATV,
     motorcycle) rigged for airdrop from the cargo ramp or floor. CRLs are individually
     restrained with a length of Type VIII nylon webbing (release gate) routed through
     ramp/floor tiedown rings and secured to the container webbing on the forward and aft
     side. At the release point the LM manually cuts the release gate, allowing the bundle to
     exit from the aircraft. Ramp bundles must be rigged IAW T.O. 13C7- series rigging
     manuals. The total weight of the bundle will not exceed 2335 lbs. Loads to be followed
     by parachutists will be rigged with breakaway static lines, unless specified in specific
     rigging directive. All remaining restraint will be removed prior to the completion of the
     10 minute checklist (EXCEPTION: Forward restraint for CRLs rigged on the ramp may
     be removed after the cargo ramp and door are in the ADS position and prior to the
     completion of the slowdown checklist). The bundle may be followed by personnel. These
     procedures may be accomplished from either side of the ramp or from the centerline.
     Specific aircraft preparation and rigging procedures are contained in T.O.1C-130(H)J-9,
     Section VII.
212                                AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


  16.45.6. CDS Airdrops.
      16.45.6.1. LMs are permitted to pull down sharply with a gloved hand or on a nylon
      strap looped over the static-line retriever winch cable to assist the cut of the release gate.
      LMs will only pull on the cable after hearing and seeing "GREEN LIGHT”.
      16.45.6.2. Manual CDS gate cuts are authorized for all CDS/I-CDS/JPADS single-stick
      airdrops (CVR or non-CVR). A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife to cut/release
      the CDS/intermediate gates. LMs will ensure they hear and see “GREEN LIGHT” before
      manually cutting the CDS/intermediate release gate. LMs are allowed to go aft of the
      buffer stop/alternate forward barrier to manually cut the release gate. Exercise caution to
      remain clear of any bundles in the event of an emergency. Manual gate cuts may be
      performed with CDS loaded into both sides of the CVR, as long as the bundles are
      released one stick at a time, and the LM has adequate space to remain clear on the
      opposite side of the exiting CDS.            WARNING: Double stick CDS released
      simultaneously will only be cut using the static-line retriever. WARNING: LM will not
      cut release gates while in the paratroop doors next to the exiting CDS.
  16.45.7. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC). The raiding craft is normally an inflated, 16
  ft rubber boat mounted on a specially constructed expendable platform. Equipment and
  supplies (including outboard motor, fuel, and other supplies) are secured inside the boat. The
  platform, weighted with sandbags, sinks when it is cut away from the boat in the water. Total
  rigged weight is approximately 2,000 lbs. The recovery parachute is a G-12D/E deployed by
  a 15 ft pilot chute packed in a T-10 deployment bag. Use the CDS Checklist. One CRRC
  with up to 19 personnel or 2 (stacked) CRRC with 18 personnel can be safely airdropped on
  one pass. Compute a CARP, unless mission directives dictate otherwise. Sea state maximum
  for CRRC drops is 3 ft High Chop/4 FT Swell for personnel in the water. For additional
  guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 Chapter 8.
  16.45.8. Rigged Alternate Method Zodiac (RAMZ)/All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) Equipment
  Airdrops. The RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470 combat rubber raiding craft with a
  35 horsepower outboard engine rigged for low velocity airdrop from any C-130 aircraft. The
  RAMZ engine is configured in a plywood box and is secured in a standard A-22 container
  using two modified T-10C parachutes. When rigged for deployment, the RAMZ package
  weighs between 600 and 900 lbs. The ATV is rigged IAW Army Field Manual 10-500-77,
  Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging Motorcycles, and Air Force Technical Order
  13C7-55-1, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment--Rigging Motorcycles. ATVs are rigged on
  combat expendable platforms and dropped using G-12E cargo parachutes equipped with 15 ft
  extraction (deployment) parachute packed in T-10 deployment bag.
      16.45.8.1. Deployment Altitudes.
         16.45.8.1.1. The minimum deployment altitude will be 3,000 ft AWL/AGL when the
         PJs exit using non-static line deployed parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for
         training.
         16.45.8.1.2. For operational missions, minimum altitude with a non-static line
         deployed parachute is 2,500 ft AWL/AGL.
         16.45.8.1.3. The minimum deployment altitude for training or non-combat single-
         pass combination air drops of RAMZ/ATV and PJs exiting with static lines will be
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 213


         800 ft AWL/AGL. NOTE: The RAMZ/ATV and PJs will be deployed from the same
         altitude.
     16.45.8.2. Deployment Procedures. In addition to the deployment procedures required by
     the specific method of delivery being used, the following procedures apply:
         16.45.8.2.1. Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will attach their static
         lines to the same anchor cable to which the RAMZ/ATV static lines are attached or
         jump on a subsequent pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are
         retrieved.
         16.45.8.2.2. Military freefall parachutists may exit from the aircraft ramp on the
         same pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved or cut, or
         exit on a subsequent pass using Fixed/Moving target JMD procedures, as appropriate.
         If dropping from the paratroop door on the subsequent pass, complete the POST-
         DEPLOYMENT checklist, and initiate the PRE-DEPLOYMENT checklist.
         16.45.8.2.3. For JMD drops, at the pilot‘s "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY" call, the JM
         will be on either side of the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft end.
         Additional jumpers will be forward of the RAMZ/ATV. The LM will be positioned to
         remove aft restraint and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times. At the "ONE
         MINUTE ADVISORY," the JM will be alerted, the load release gate is checked, and
         the aft restraint is removed.
         16.45.8.2.4. The LM will relay "Safety Checks Complete" to the PF if the JM has
         already gone off interphone. The PM will turn on the green light, indicating to the JM
         that conditions are satisfactory for the airdrop.
         16.45.8.2.5. The JM will determine the exit point and deploy prior to receiving a
         “No-drop” notification or seeing the red light on. The LM will relay to the PF all
         visual corrections given by the JM. The JM will signal for the LM to cut the release
         gate. WARNING: If a “No-drop” is called and the RAMZ/ATV is held in place by
         only the release gate, all personnel will move forward of the load, except the LM and
         the JM who will monitor the RAMZ/ATV for possible shifting and secure as
         necessary. WARNING: If the RAMZ/ATV exits the aircraft but fails to properly
         deploy, the static lines will be cut immediately.  CAUTION: The release gate must
         be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free through floor tie down
         rings.
     16.45.8.3. Limitations. During training, limit sea state for RAMZ to 5, Moderate Wave
     (10ft), taking a pronounced long form, with many white caps. Limitations for operational
     or contingency missions will be determined by the JM in coordination with the PIC.
  16.45.9. Specialized Rescue Airdrops.
     16.45.9.1. Aircrew Procedures. Use either the PERSONNEL/CRL or SEARCH AND
     RESCUE checklist. EXCEPTION: Refer to AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for guidance on rescue
     equipment (MA-1 kit, parabundle, or freefall) airdrops.
     16.45.9.2. Free Fall Airdrops. The delivery of certain types of supplies, such as bulk
     food products or clothing, can be accomplished without the use of parachutes. Free-fall
214                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      bundles are similar to parabundles but consist of only non-destructible items which are
      able to be airdropped without a recovery parachute attached.
         16.45.9.2.1. Drift Effect. For free-fall airdrops, wind drift need not be considered.
      16.45.9.3. Parabundle Airdrops. Parabundles are small items rigged with a small
      recovery parachute which are able to be dropped from a door without the need for a
      CARP/HARP.
      16.45.9.4. Minimum Drop Altitudes. For freefall airdrops minimum altitude during the
      day is 150 ft and 500 ft at night. For parabundle airdrops minimum altitude during the
      day is 300 ft and 500 ft at night. WARNING: Keeps turns below 300 ft AGL to a
      minimum.
      16.45.9.5. MA-1 Sea Rescue Kit. The MA-1 kit is designed to meet conditions which
      require aerial delivery of emergency flotation and survival gear. It consists of five
      bundles, each connected with 210 ft of buoyant rope. The kit is dropped free-fall and
      abeam during a crosswind pass over the target. When correctly dropped, a straight line is
      formed on the water with an inflated raft at each end. After delivery, the two rafts with
      their high freeboard will begin to drift downwind until retarded by the partially
      submerged supply containers. Thus, when the kit is properly deployed, wind conditions
      will cause the kit to form a “U,” partially encircling the target. Aircrews will use the
      SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklists.
         16.45.9.5.1. The Sea Rescue Kit consists of five bundles. The two end bundles (1 and
         5) contain either a six, seven or 20 man raft. Bundles 2 and 4 contain emergency
         radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear. The total weight of all five bundles is 232
         lbs for a MA-1 kit and 311 lbs for a MA-2 kit. The kit is deployed manually off the
         cargo ramp.
         16.45.9.5.2. Rigging Sequence.
             16.45.9.5.2.1. During in-flight rigging, the cargo ramp and door will remain
             closed. Attach a tiedown strap across the kit to prevent movement.
             16.45.9.5.2.2. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft),
             marked 1 of 5 and leave open. Remove enough lanyard from the retaining loops
             to allow the snap fastener (yellow) to be fastened to ramp tie-down fitting 30F.
             16.45.9.5.2.3. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #1 to allow the rope
             fastener (red) to be connected to the D-ring (red) of container #2, marked 2 of 5.
             16.45.9.5.2.4. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #2 to allow the rope
             fastener (green) to be connected to the D-ring (green) of the container #3, marked
             3 of 5.
             16.45.9.5.2.5. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #3 to allow the snap
             fastener (blue) to be connected to the D-ring (blue) of container #4, marked 4 of
             5.
             16.45.9.5.2.6. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #4 to allow the rope
             snap fastener (white) to be connected to the lanyard loop of container #5, marked
             5 of 5.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 215


            16.45.9.5.2.7. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protector flap on container #5 and
            leave open. Remove enough lanyard from the retaining loops to allow the snap
            fastener (yellow) to be fastened to the ramp tie-down ring 30B.
  16.45.10. Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS). The Low Cost Aerial Delivery
  System is a one-time use, stand-alone airdrop system consisting of a modular suite of low
  cost airdrop items, and comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items
  configured for low-velocity, high-velocity, and free fall-drop aerial delivery of loads.
     16.45.10.1. Rigging. Breakaway static lines will be used regardless of altitude. The
     static line break tie will be full strength type III nylon (550) cord for all LCADS
     parachutes.    NOTE: Use of gutted type III nylon (550) cord will result in chute
     deployment failure. Joint airdrop inspectors will ensure proper static line configuration,
     including anti-oscillation ties.
     16.45.10.2. Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-High Velocity (LCADS-HV) is not
     authorized for training use. LCADS-HV is authorized for contingency missions and
     developmental/operational test & evaluation (DT&E/OT&E) missions.
     16.45.10.3. Low Cost Aerial Deliver System-Low Altitude (LCLA) is one of the army's
     low cost airdrop systems. LCLA was designed to provide very low altitude aerial
     resupply using small fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. LCLA parachutes are
     compatible with A-7A, and A-21 containers. Containers may be rigged with a single
     parachute or with clusters of up to three parachutes.
  16.45.11. JPADS Airdrops (I-CDS/I-CRL and Guided). JPADS operations are conducted
  using the JPADS T-1 aircraft modification. Specific aircraft/aircrew equipment includes the
  GPS Retransmission kit (GPS-RTK), UHF Dropsonde Receiver Subsystem (UHF-DRS), the
  JPADS Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) laptop and software. I-CDS loads are normally rigged
  CDS loads with non-steerable chutes. JPADS guided operations are conducted using
  steerable chutes rigged with Autonomous Guidance Units (AGUs). When referenced in this
  volume, JPADS refers to the aircraft equipment and family of guided and unguided systems.
     16.45.11.1. Aircrew Qualification. JPADS-qualified PADS Operators (POs) are
     authorized to use the JPADS-MP to calculate release points for JPADS/I-CDS/I-CRL,
     JPADS guided combination personnel/equipment, and normal (CDS/CRL) airdrop
     operations.
     16.45.11.2. JPADS Alert Procedures. When alert postured and JPADS equipment is
     installed on the alert aircraft, the mission planner has the following responsibilities:
         16.45.11.2.1. Manage         Forecasts.    4D     forecast    data     from      AFWA
         (https://weather.afwa.af.mil/PADS) should be downloaded for the alert coverage
         area and uploaded to the JPADS-MP laptop once every 24-hour period. 45km
         resolution cells are sufficient for wide-area coverage. 5km or 15km (where available)
         should be downloaded for specific objective areas and defined areas of operation.
         When an increased alert posture is necessary to support contingency operations and
         5km 4D forecast resolution cells are not available, contact AFWA at DSN 312-271-
         0690 ASAP and request the generation of coverage. In the event that an aircraft is
         alerted and departs without 4D forecast data for the objective area, this data should be
         immediately downloaded and passed to the aircraft in-flight via HPW. NOTE:
216                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         Accomplishment of duties listed in paragraph 16.45.11.2.1 is not limited to qualified
         POs.
         16.45.11.2.2. Pre-Build Missions. A qualified PO should build and save a mission on
         the JPADS-MP laptop that contains all of the JPADS equipment that is pre-positioned
         and loaded on the sealed alert aircraft. Leave DZ information blank and do not
         calculate release points.
         16.45.11.2.3. Remote-Assisted JPADS. When an aircraft or crew is not JPADS
         capable due to lack of equipment or aircrew certification, but a qualified HC-130 PO
         and JPADS-MP system are available in the TOC, JPADS release data may be relayed
         to the aircraft via any possible means. Aircrews are permitted to release I-CDS/I-CRL
         and guided loads based on release points generated remotely. When employing
         JPADS in this manner, all required information must be relayed to the aircraft (PI
         latitude/longitude, PI elevation, nominal release point latitude/longitude, release
         altitude, etc). This procedure may also be used to relay data from one airborne
         JPADS-qualified aircrew/aircraft to another aircraft in-flight.
      16.45.11.3. In-Flight Procedures. The PO will determine a release point using dropsonde
      data (when necessary), and will advise the crew of the updated release point. After the
      JPADS-MP produces an updated release point, it is entered into the CNI-MU. The PM
      and PO will verify that the release point coordinates and all airdrop parameters are
      entered correctly into the navigation system. For verification, the PO will read the
      JPADS-MP computed release point coordinates directly from the JPADS-MP while the
      PM verifies the same information is in the CNI-MU.
      16.45.11.4. Dropsonde and Weather Data Requirements.
         16.45.11.4.1. Unguided (I-CDS/I-CRL). One dropsonde with a vertical wind profile
         consisting of gaps less than 2,000 ft is required for airdrops greater than 3,000 ft
         AGL.
         16.45.11.4.2. Guided (AGU, Paranav, or Remote Guidance). Either a valid AFWA
         4D forecast of 15km (mountainous DZ) /45km (non-mountainous DZ) or one
         dropsonde with a vertical wind profile consisting of gaps less than 2,000 ft is
         required.
         16.45.11.4.3. Waiver Authority. The waiver authority for unguided and guided
         weather data requirements is the squadron or deployed commander.
      16.45.11.5. Release Procedure. Use the approved checklist for dropsonde and I-CDS/I-
      CRL/JPADS airdrops. During the dropsonde release, use of zero flaps at speeds between
      170 – 180 KIAS is required to preclude dropsonde tail strikes. LMs should release the
      dropsondes from the corners of the cargo ramp.
      16.45.11.6. Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA). The PO or mission planner is
      required to provide JPADS-MP derived release points for each airdrop pass and a
      completed CDA prior to an airdrop mission. Both pilots will review preflight release
      points/CDA for each respective airdrop. For training and civil missions, units are
      responsible for performing a full collateral damage assessment prior to JPADS airdrops.
      The CDA must be coordinated and approved by the area controlling agency. Coordinate
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   217


     with the owning agency of the restricted airspace or controlled airspace and landowners
     with property surrounding the DZ for all JPADS operations. Examine the area in the
     vicinity of the DZ for potential damage or hazards in the course of normal operations or
     during extraordinary system failure events. If the CDA demonstrates potential damage or
     hazards restrict airdrop release Launch Acceptability Region (LAR), lower the drop
     altitude, change the run-in, change parachute type or cancel operations. Inform the
     controlling unit of the risk to their operations; the controlling unit, and the Joint Force
     Controller (JFC) designated agency are approving authorities for risk to the area
     surrounding the DZ. Intelligence personnel (JPRC) are responsible for providing the JFC-
     designated agency close-up and overview imagery to facilitate CDA. For training units
     are highly encouraged to contact HQ ACC/A3J (2-3 weeks prior) in order to ensure all
     planning, coordination and reviews/assessments have been accomplished. The CDA must
     include, at a minimum, a review of the airspace and ground space with respect to:
        16.45.11.6.1. Release point and LAR location.
        16.45.11.6.2. 63% 1-sigma I-CDS success ellipse.
        16.45.11.6.3. Chute failure footprint.
        16.45.11.6.4. Guidance failure footprint.
     16.45.11.7. Visibility Requirements. IMC/VMC day/night airdrops are authorized for
     contingency operations. CONUS training operations are required to comply with FAR
     §105 ―Parachute Operations restrictions. Drops conducted through or originating from
     IMC are only authorized from within or above an active restricted area. JPADS
     parachutes will not be dropped through severe turbulence or severe icing.
     16.45.11.8. Navigation Requirements. For all JPADS operations an EGI Figure of Merit
     (FOM) 3 is required.
     16.45.11.9. Wind Limits. Wind limitations are unrestricted for dropsonde operations, 18
     knots for Firefly, Screamer, and Dragonfly and as published in AFI 13-217 for all other
     parachutes.
     16.45.11.10. DZ Size. DZ size criteria for JPADS and I-CDS drops during contingency
     operations is at the discretion of the user. AFI 13-217 DZ size restrictions apply during
     training.
     16.45.11.11. JPADS Guided Footprint Locations. During normal training operations a
     JPADS DZ, release point, chute failure footprint, and guidance failure footprint will be
     located within a restricted airspace. If winds force the release point outside of restricted
     airspace, additional coordination with ATC is required prior to airdrop operations. This
     includes coordination with the ATC agency, filing a NOTAM, and ensuring airspace is
     clear for the entire guided system‘s flight profile from the drop altitude to the ground.
     EXCEPTION: Operational Test (OT) airdrops conducted or supported by 88 TES
     aircrew do not have to comply with the restrictions in paragraph 16.45.11.11 if the
     exception is identified in the test plan.
        16.45.11.11.1. During normal training operations the entire 1-sigma (63%) I-CDS
        success footprint will be located within the surveyed DZ boundaries. The chute
        failure footprint must fall within restricted airspace. If outside of a restricted airspace
218                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         the chute failure must fall on the surveyed DZ. If operating in a restricted area and
         winds force the RP outside of restricted airspace coordination with ATC is required
         prior to airdrop operations.
      16.45.11.12. Jettison of JPADS AGU with Military GPS (MILGPS). Instances of
      jettison, unauthorized access, tampering, theft, or loss of the JPADS MILGPS enclosure
      must be reported to the GPS Controlling Authority (CA). Each such report shall include
      the JPADS MILGPS serial number and Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module
      (SAASM) GPS serial number of the missing item and must state whether the system was
      keyed or unkeyed. Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will relay
      such jettison to the GPS CA. NOTE: Time permitting; the LM with concurrence from
      the PO will remove the MILGPS enclosure from the AGU prior to load jettison.
      16.45.11.13. JPADS AGU MILGPS Procedure. For training missions with Air Force
      JPADS AGUs, aircrew will check out the MILGPS from the unit tactics office. Upon
      mission completion and prior to removing the MILGPS enclosure, power up the AGU
      and accomplish the Recovery Mission Duration Zeroization function (if desired). Zeroize
      prior to removal by pushing, for three seconds, the zeroize button located on the front
      panel of the MILGPS enclosure.      NOTE: Keying and unkeying requires the MILGPS
      to be installed in a powered ON AGU. The AGU LCD screen should update within 20
      seconds and should read MILGPS Keyed or Unkeyed. Once complete power OFF the
      AGU. The PO will remove and return the enclosure to the unit’s tactics office.
      16.45.11.14. Additional Guidance. Review AFI 13-217 for amplified information on
      JPADS DZ and airspace restrictions.
  16.45.12. IMC Drop.
      16.45.12.1. IMC Drop Altitude. Plan minimum IMC drop altitude of 500 ft above the
      highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
      400 ft plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is
      higher, within 3 NM of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point, or as
      specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.
      16.45.12.2. IFR Drop Corridor. As defined in FAR Exemption 4371, the corridor where
      aircraft may transition between IMC enroute altitude and IMC drop altitude to perform
      airdrop operations. The beginning of the corridor, the IFR Drop Corridor Ingress Point, is
      a maximum of 40 NMs from the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point (co-located with the DZ
      Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes not lower than 500 ft above the highest
      obstruction to flight (manmade obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 ft
      plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest,
      within 3 NMs either side of centerline.
         16.45.12.2.1. DZ Entry Point. The point where an aircraft may safely begin descent
         from IFR enroute altitude or a segmented altitude to IMC drop altitude.
         16.45.12.2.2. DZ Exit Point. A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline
         where each aircraft will be at minimum IFR enroute altitude. Normally, calculate the
         exit point based on a 1000 FPM climb at 140 KIAS. Analyze 3-engine climb
         performance and ensure obstacle clearance at pre-airdrop gross weight. If unable to
         clear all obstacles on 3-engines, adjust the DZ exit point based on 3-engine climb
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                               219


          capability. This point will be a minimum of 4 NMs track distance from the trailing
          edge of the DZ.       WARNING: Analyze pre-drop gross weight to determine if
          obstructions can be cleared on 3- engines from DZ Entry through DZ Exit. If
          obstructions cannot be cleared, reduce aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or
          escape course, or increase drop altitude.

Section 16E—Helicopter Air-To-Air Refueling (HAAR)

16.46. HAAR Operations. HAAR operations will be conducted IAW ATP-56(B), T.O.1C-
130(H)J-1, and AFTTP 3-1/3.HC-130.
   16.46.1. Minimum HAAR Altitudes.
      16.46.1.1. Training. HAAR will not be conducted below 1,000 ft AGL on normal
      training missions. Waiver authority for HAAR down to 500 ft AGL is MAJCOM/A3 or
      deployed equivalent. OG/CCs may request standing waivers for local HAAR tracks and
      recurring major exercises be included in their supplement to this instruction. NOTE:
      Low altitude HAAR training (below 1,000 ft AGL) will not be conducted at tanker gross
      weights above 130,000 lbs or without a minimum three engine climb capability of 500
      FPM.
      16.46.1.2. Contingency/Combat. Plan HAAR altitudes as follows:
          16.46.1.2.1. Day Operations. Compute HAAR altitude no lower than 500 ft AGL
          above the highest terrain or obstacle within 1 NM of the air refueling/flight planned
          track.
          16.46.1.2.2. NVG Operations. Compute HAAR altitude no lower than 500 ft AGL
          above the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of the air refueling/flight planned
          track. NOTE: HAAR altitudes below 1,000 ft AGL may be required due to the
          threat environment or weather conditions on actual rescue or combat missions. Final
          HAAR altitude in no case will be lower than 300 ft above the receivers’ minimum
          enroute altitude capability. WARNING: Low altitude HAAR (below 1,000 ft AGL)
          assumes permissive terrain and is not normally possible at night with unaided vision.
          Large turns or course reversals below 1,000 ft AGL should be avoided.
          WARNING: When operating at or near minimum operating speed, any bank angle
          could result in a stall without warning.
   16.46.2. ATP-56(B), Part 3 guidance is supplemented as follows:
      16.46.2.1. HC-130J aircrews will not use Rendezvous (RV) Altitudes (AAR altitude +
      500 ft) under normal circumstances during rendezvous operations. Tankers will conduct
      rendezvous and join-up operations at refueling altitude (AAR altitude) unless operational
      requirements dictate otherwise.
      16.46.2.2. HC-130J aircrews will not fly RV BRAVO (Head-On) procedures listed in
      Part 3, Chapter 2, Annex 2B.
      16.46.2.3. Either the tanker or receiver may initiate/direct a breakaway when an unsafe
      condition is identified.

Section 16F—Receiver Air-To-Air Refueling (AAR)
 220                                 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


16.47. General. ATP-56(B) provides the basic guidance for refueling terminology and
procedures.
16.48. Policy. The following policies apply to all air refueling conditions regardless of emission
control or type of rendezvous:
   16.48.1. AAR will only be accomplished by an AAR qualified pilot, or a pilot in training
   under the supervision of an instructor. Unqualified pilots, undergoing AAR training, must
   inform the tanker prior to completing any contacts and receive an acknowledgment.
   16.48.2. Use manual boom latching procedures only during fuel emergencies and
   contingency operations. EXCEPTION: Manual boom latching procedures are authorized
   for all AAR operations with the KC-10A if the tanker‘s independent disconnect system is
   operational. CAUTION: Air refueling operations will not be conducted when radio
   communications capability between the tanker and receiver is lost, except during emergency
   fuel situation.
   16.48.3. During aerial refueling missions, fuel will not be onloaded with an inoperative drain
   pump.
   16.48.4. Do not make any HF radio transmissions or Electronic Counter Measures emissions
   during AAR operations. EXEPTION: ECM expendable patterns approved for use during
   AAR may be utilized IAW their flight tested parameters.
16.49. Special Operations Procedures:
   16.49.1. Lighting:
       16.49.1.1. Tanker lighting:
           16.49.1.1.1. Director lights-bright.
           16.49.1.1.2. Boom nozzle and boom marker lights – bright and on, respectively.
           16.49.1.1.3. Under wing illumination lights-bright.
           16.49.1.1.4. All lights will remain bright until the receiver is approaching the pre-
           contact position. At this time, director lights and under wing illumination lights will
           go to the normal refueling position and boom nozzle lights to low. Tail mounted
           flood light may be used in normal operation. All remaining lights will remain off,
           safety permitting.
       16.49.1.2. Receiver Lighting:
           16.49.1.2.1. Slipway lights – bright or as directed.
           16.49.1.2.2. Area lights – bright or as directed.
           16.49.1.2.3. IR rotating beacon/strobes-on or as directed.
           16.49.1.2.4. All other lights will be off, except position lights will be on for training
           missions.
           16.49.1.2.5. All lights will remain bright until the receiver visually acquires the
           tanker. At this time, slipway and area lights will be turned to normal night refueling
           setting. If no ―“TALLY HO” call is heard and a “JUDY” call is made, rotating
           beacon will be turned off at pre-contact.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                221


  16.49.2. Rendezvous Procedures. Use enroute overtaking rendezvous. Both tanker and
  receiver will monitor primary air refueling frequency (secure) 30 minutes prior to the RZCT.
  Limit transmissions to those specified below unless operational requirements dictate
  otherwise.
     16.49.2.1. Tanker:
         16.49.2.1.1. At the entry point, adjust airspeed to 275 Knots Indicated Airspeed
         (KIAS) and ensure external lighting is set.
         16.49.2.1.2. Upon visual contact with the receiver and in a position to complete the
         rendezvous, the tanker boom operator will transmit “TALLY HO” on primary AAR
         frequency (secure.)
         16.49.2.1.3. If “JUDY” is heard, tanker will slow to AR speed and proceed down
         track. Tanker lead will acknowledge by turning the lower rotating beacon on then off
         (daylight, wing rock.) During training and exercises, the tanker will also transmit the
         numeric part of their call sign and altitude (secure.) They will switch to plain (non-
         secure) as the receiver approaches pre-contact.
     16.49.2.2. Receiver:
         16.49.2.2.1. At the entry point, the receiver will be at the rendezvous altitude at 215
         KIAS and ensure outside lighting is set. Plan to arrive at the Rendezvous Initial Point
         (RZIP) at the RZCT.
         16.49.2.2.2. Upon hearing the tanker call “TALLY HO,” turn off the IR rotating
         beacon for 10 seconds (daylight, wing rock). During training and exercises, the
         receiver will also transmit the numeric part of their call sign and altitude on primary
         AAR frequency (secure). Approaching pre-contact, switch to plain (non-secure.)
         16.49.2.2.3. Should the tanker pass the receiver and advance to a position in front of
         the receiver without calling “TALLY HO,” and if the receiver is in position to
         complete the rendezvous, the receiver will transmit “JUDY” on the secure primary
         refueling frequency. The tanker will respond as described in paragraph 16.49.2.1.3.
         16.49.2.2.4. The receiver then moves to the pre-contact position and switches to the
         primary refueling frequency (non-secure.)
  16.49.3. Control Time Adjustment:
     16.49.3.1. Revised ETA prior to RZIP. If tanker is notified of a revised receiver ETA
     prior to crossing the RZIP, the tanker will adjust timing to arrive at the RZIP at the
     revised RZCT.
     16.49.3.2. Revised ETA after RZIP. If notified after passing the RZIP, the tanker will
     delay at the ARCP or RZIP and adjust timing to make an enroute overtaking rendezvous
     at RZIP based on new RZCT. If the tanker is unable to make the timing at the RZIP they
     will rendezvous at the RZCP using the adjusted RZCT.
  16.49.4. Post Strike Rendezvous Procedures. For missions that do not have a firm RZCT, a
  control time window will be established. This provides the tanker with a no earlier than/No
  Later Than (NLT) RZCT time for rendezvous. Tankers will arrive at the RZIP no later than
  the earliest possible control time. If there is no receiver, tanker will proceed to RZCP and
 222                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


   hold using 2-minute legs, left-hand turns. The receiver, when enroute to AAR and NLT 10
   minutes from the RZIP, will call the tanker (secure) with the revised RZCT. The tanker will
   adjust orbit to make an enroute overtaking rendezvous at the RZIP at the new control time.
   16.49.5. Completion of Refueling.
       16.49.5.1. The tanker will plan to offload the pre-briefed transfer load.
       16.49.5.2. Upon transfer of the planned onload, the receiver will initiate a normal
       disconnect and close the UARRSI door.
       16.49.5.3. If more fuel is required, leave the UARRSI door open and return to the pre-
       contact position.
   16.49.6. Missed Rendezvous. If the rendezvous has not been made as planned, enter a left-
   hand holding pattern at the RZCP and use the following procedures to accomplish the
   rendezvous:
       16.49.6.1. Receiver Procedures for Missed Rendezvous.
          16.49.6.1.1. On arrival at the RZCP, the receiver will enter a left-hand holding
          pattern, adjusting the first pattern so as to arrive back at the RZCP on an 8-minute
          multiple from the RZCT, the “Rule of Eight.” Example: A receiver is on time at the
          RZIP and arrives at the RZCP at the RZCT (0100Z) without hearing “TALLY HO”
          (secure) or seeing the tanker. The receiver enters holding, adjusting so as to arrive
          back at the RZCP at the RZCT plus 8 minutes (0108Z, 0116Z, etc.)
          16.49.6.1.2. Maintain 1,000 ft below the refueling altitude.
          16.49.6.1.3. Maintain 215 KIAS until entering holding at the RZCP, then as required.
          16.49.6.1.4. Upon hearing “TALLY HO” (secure), proceed down track and complete
          the rendezvous.
          16.49.6.1.5. If the receiver acquires the tanker and is in a position to complete the
          rendezvous, call “JUDY” (secure) and complete the rendezvous.
       16.49.6.2. Tanker Procedures for Missed Rendezvous.
          16.49.6.2.1. The tanker enters a left-hand holding pattern upon arrival at the RZCP,
          adjusting holding to rendezvous with the receivers based on the “rule of eight” at the
          RZCP. Rendezvous equipment will not be turned on unless directed by receiver.
          16.49.6.2.2. Maintain refueling altitude.
          16.49.6.2.3. Maintain 275 KIAS.
          16.49.6.2.4. Upon positively identifying the receiver, the tanker will maneuver for
          rendezvous and will call “TALLY HO” (secure) when ready for the receiver. If the
          receiver calls “JUDY” (secure), slow to refueling airspeed and proceed down track.
16.50. Breakaway Procedures:
   16.50.1. Tanker. The tanker will flash the receiver director lights as the primary indication
   for a breakaway. The lower rotating beacon will be turned on as an additional signal. A
   radio call will be used as the last resort. When the tanker is ready to resume refueling the
   lower rotating beacon will be turned off.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 223


   16.50.2. Receiver. Initiate a breakaway when conditions warrant. Resume refueling when
   the tanker is ready.
16.51. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV). Whenever practical, refueling operations are done on
tracks or anchor areas published in DoD FLIP. ALTRVs are used when certain missions or
operational considerations may require air refueling operations in areas not published in FLIP.
For specific ALTRV procedures, refer to FLIP and FAA Special Military Operations 7610.4H, 3.

Section 16G—Hot Refueling/Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations

16.52. General Information
   16.52.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for Hot Refueling/FARP for HC-130J
   aircraft. The guidance in this chapter supplements the procedures outlined in TO 00-25-172,
   GROUND SERVICING OF AIRCRAFT AND STATIC GROUNDING/BONDING, AFI 11-
   235, FORWARD REFUELING POINT (FARP) OPERATIONS, AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 and
   checklists. A comprehensive mission briefing and strict compliance with these procedures
   will ensure an expeditious safe refueling operation.
   16.52.2. Applicability. This chapter is applicable to all HC-130J units and crews
   conducting hot refueling or FARP.
   16.52.3. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this
   instruction, unless safety dictates otherwise.
       16.52.3.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
       circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect
       the crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate
       action is required, the PIC has ultimate authority and responsibility for the course of
       action to be taken. Report deviations, without waiver, through channels to HQ
       ACC/A3TV within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested.
       16.52.3.2. Unless otherwise indicated, ACC/A3TV is the waiver authority for
       operational procedure requirements contained in this volume. Waver authority may be
       delegated to deployed equivalent for operationally assigned forces.
   16.52.4. Terms. The following terms are unique to hot refueling operations:
       16.52.4.1. Wet Wing Refueling. Engines not running (power cart, GTC, or APU used).
       The same checklist and procedures apply as for hot refueling.
       16.52.4.2. Tanker Operations. The act of providing fuel to a receiver source at a hot
       refueling site.
       16.52.4.3. Receiver Operations. The act of receiving fuel at a hot refueling site.
       16.52.4.4. Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ). The area within 50 ft of a pressurized fuel
       carrying component and 25 feet around fuel vent outlets of an aircraft.
   16.52.5. Hot refueling and FARP Equipment. Refueling aircraft while engines are running
   requires specific equipment and inspections prior to commencing operations. Only
   equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO 37A9-7-2-1, and in the system safety
   engineering analysis (SSEA) shall be used. This equipment is unique in that it provides for an
224                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


  internal bond that is not provided for with conventional refueling equipment. If unapproved
  equipment is used, the refueling operation must be accomplished without engines running
  (cold refueling).
      16.52.5.1. Required personal equipment for personnel having direct contact with
      refueling equipment:
         16.52.5.1.1. Spare Nomex flight gloves.
         16.52.5.1.2. Extra flight suit or complete change of clothing, including flight boots.
         16.52.5.1.3. Full canteen (filled with water), to be carried on your person.
         16.52.5.1.4. NVGs with spare battery (as required).
         16.52.5.1.5. Dust goggles (as required).
         16.52.5.1.6. Survival vest (as required).
         16.52.5.1.7. Overt/IR chemlights and/or flashlights (as required).
         16.52.5.1.8. IR compatible flashlight (as required).
         16.52.5.1.9. Sealable water and fuel resistant garment bag to store fuel soaked
         clothing. NOTE: Skin contact with fuel causes minor burns, irritation and severe loss
         of body oils in the affected area. Immediately, remove all fuel soaked clothing and
         wash affected areas thoroughly. Put clean clothing on and seal fuel soaked clothes in
         a plastic bag. Clothing splashed or soaked with fuel will not be worn on aircraft due
         to combustion and fume hazard.
  16.52.6. Weather Requirements. For training operations and exercises, stop fuel servicing
  when high winds or reduced visibility caused by blowing rain, snow, or sand exists or when
  an electrical storm is within a five mile radius of the hot refueling site. Sound travels about
  1/5 of a mile per second. An approximation of the number of miles to the storm can be made
  by counting the seconds between the flash of lightning and the sound of thunder and dividing
  this number by five. For real world operations, consider the distance of the storm from the
  refueling site, direction it is traveling, and its intensity, and use good judgment to determine
  when to suspend fueling operations.
  16.52.7. Safety. Because of the inherent dangers with the ground refueling and rearming of
  aircraft, safety cannot be overemphasized. Safety is the responsibility of all personnel and is
  considered before, during, and after all refueling operations. Any person observing an unsafe
  situation, practice, or procedure should immediately inform all personnel, and all refueling
  and rearming operations will immediately stop until the unsafe condition can be eliminated.
      16.52.7.1. Safety guidance. Each aircraft and the refueling equipment involved in the
      operation was subjected to a System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA), which
      includes; a failure mode/effects criticality assessments, and operating/support hazard
      analysis. This process considers the weapon system, support equipment and the personnel
      interface. Overall, the system safety approach minimizes the hazards associated with this
      operation, reducing them to an acceptable level.
      16.52.7.2. Electrostatic discharge. Energy levels associated with electrostatic discharge
      are several times the energy required to ignite fuel vapors. A charge of static electricity
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                225


     can accumulate from fuel flowing through piping, hoses, couplers, and nozzles.
     Operating aircraft engines, rotor blades, and propeller blades also generate high static
     electricity voltages. The normal activity of personnel involved in refueling operations can
     generate static electricity on their clothing. To equalize these charges and reduce the
     possibility of sparks, aircraft and refueling equipment are bonded to each other. The
     electrical bonding of refueling servicing equipment and aircraft is a critical item because
     aircraft are not normally grounded for this operation.
     16.52.7.3. In the event of static discharge, forward the following data to ACC/A3TW
     following all Hot Refueling/FARP operations: type aircraft involved, OAT, dew point,
     humidity, engines running / low speed / shutdown, taxiway / runway surface, indication
     of discharge, and sequence followed when bonding / grounding.
     16.52.7.4. Fire Protection:
     16.52.7.4.1. Personnel involved in servicing operations will be trained in the use of
     portable fire extinguishers
        16.52.7.4.2. If Hot Refueling/FARP operations are being conducted at an ACC,
        AFSOC or AMC certified site, a minimum of one 20-pound dry chemical will be
        located in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft SPR and the fuel servicing equipment.
        Additionally, crash fire rescue vehicle will be on standby IAW TO 00-25-172 and/or
        AFI 11-235. If a fuel truck is used as the tanker, a 150 pound Halon 1211 fire
        extinguisher will be used in lieu of the 20-pound extinguisher.
        16.52.7.4.3. For exercises or contingencies where a crash fire vehicle cannot be
        provided, a minimum of one 20-pound dry chemical extinguisher will be positioned
        at the receiver SPR and the refueling source.
     16.52.7.5. Heat exhaustion and carbon monoxide inhalation: Heat exhaustion and carbon
     monoxide inhalation, although not serious problems are two factors that can affect a
     crew’s ability to perform at their peak. You can suffer heat exhaustion or minor burns
     from the heat of the engines combined with wind conditions. You may also inhale carbon
     monoxide from the engine exhausts. The following are suggestions of how to minimize
     the effects of heat and carbon monoxide if the tactical situation will permit:
        16.52.7.5.1. Keep drinking water available, and drink large quantities of water to
        help prevent dehydration.
        16.52.7.5.2. Raising the aircraft flaps may reduce the exhaust being placed on the
        loadmaster. Wind direction, temperature, location, and environment are all factors to
        be considered.
     16.52.7.6. Use of 100 percent nylon garments. The wear of Gortex is authorized for
     aircraft servicing with JP-5/8/10, Jet-A, and diesel fuel (including mixed fuel criteria).
     Personnel will not wear Gortex within 50-feet when servicing aircraft with JP-4 or
     ground servicing with Mogas.
     16.52.7.7. General Ordnance Procedures. Aircraft may be refueled with engines running
     with live ordnance aboard, however upload/download of ordnance and refueling of
     aircraft will normally be conducted as separate operations; a separate area should be
     established at least 300 feet from the Hot Refueling/FARP site. During combat or
 226                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


       contingency operations, concurrent refueling and upload/download of ordnance may be
       authorized when, in the judgment of the mission commander, operational necessity and
       benefits of reducing ground time outweigh the risks involved.
   16.52.8. Electronic Emissions:
       16.52.8.1. Inertial navigational systems may remain energized.
       16.52.8.2. Radar and ECM equipment will not be operated within the refueling area.
       16.52.8.3. Any hand-held radios used within the FSSZ must be intrinsically safe.
       16.52.8.4. HF radio transmissions are not allowed within the FSSZ during refueling
       operations.
       16.52.8.5. Internal Communications. During ground operations, communications can be
       difficult due to aircraft noise levels. Interphone discipline is essential so emergency calls
       may be relayed clearly. All unnecessary voice communication is prohibited for safety
       reasons.
   16.52.9. Aircraft Marshaling:
       16.52.9.1. When CCT/STS are responsible for primary air traffic control of an airfield,
       they will marshal and control all aircraft movement into the refueling site. If CCT/STS
       are not available, all aircraft are responsible for self marshaling into the refueling site.
       16.52.9.2. Aircraft commanders must ensure marshaling procedures are thoroughly pre-
       briefed between all agencies involved prior to refueling operations. These procedures
       must be strictly adhered to at all times, to ensure all safety requirements are met.
16.53. Hot Refueling.
   16.53.1. General. For ACC aircrews, basic hot refueling is the transfer of fuel (refuel or
   defuel) at sites where all required equipment is provided at that site. Aircrews qualified in hot
   refueling may refuel/defuel at fixed-sites, refuel/defuel with approved fuel trucks and receive
   fuel from a fixed-wing tanker at FARP sites. NVG-qualified aircrews may conduct hot
   refueling operations under NVG conditions.
   16.53.2. Planning Factors: Planners must be aware of factors which limit hot refueling
   employment and should consider the following when including a hot refueling option in an
   exercise or contingency:
       16.53.2.1. Passengers. Personnel and equipment may be off/on-loaded in conjunction
       with refueling operations. Personnel movement on or off the aircraft should be monitored
       to maintain accountability in case of an emergency.
       16.53.2.2. Hot refueling sites. Depending on the sister service or host nation there can be
       several different types of hot refueling sites. Some of the different types of sites are as
       follows:
          16.53.2.2.1. Forward Area Refueling Equipment (FARE). Forward area refueling
          equipment sites are normally setup by the Army using blivets to refuel aircraft. Hot
          refueling qualified crews may conduct refueling /defueling operation at these sites.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  227


        16.53.2.2.2. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP). Forward area refueling point
        sites are normally established for aircraft to aircraft refueling. Hot refueling qualified
        crews may conduct receiver operations at these sites. NOTE: Refueling trucks may
        conduct refueling/defueling operations to a single aircraft at FARP sites.
        16.53.2.2.3. Hot Refueling Site. Hot refueling site is a generic term used for a site
        that refuels/defuels aircraft with engines running from a fixed source or a fuel truck.
        Hot refueling qualified crews may conduct operations at these sites. WARNING: All
        hot refueling sites will have a current site survey and meet the minimum unobstructed
        egress distance required by the survey to ensure the aircraft can taxi from the site in
        the event of an emergency. If the egress distance is less than the required minimum or
        the egress area is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform refueling/defueling
        in a cold environment only.
     16.53.2.3. Planners must verify equipment at intended Hot Refueling location is
     approved for use in hot refueling operations. Refer to T.O. 00-25-172, TO 37A9-7-2-1
     and SSEA for approved equipment.
  16.53.3. Responsibilities. Only current and qualified crewmembers will be allowed to
  occupy a primary crew position on hot refueling missions. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in
  training under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor. NOTE: The Pilot,
  Copilot, and Combat Systems Operator will remain on the flight deck in the event of an
  emergency taxi.
     16.53.3.1. The PIC is responsible for the overall safety of the crew and the aircraft hot
     refueling operations. The PIC relies on the LM to announce any unusual situations and to
     recommend the best course of action.
     16.53.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will:
        16.53.3.2.1. Ensure approval has been granted by the proper authority prior to
        conducting hot refueling operations.
        16.53.3.2.2. Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities.
        16.53.3.2.3. Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking
        action. Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay hot refueling operations.
        16.53.3.2.4. Analyze planned hot refueling area for hazards and sufficient taxi
        clearances.
        16.53.3.2.5. Determine fuel requirements to include estimated on-load and off-load.
     16.53.3.3. The CSO/CP will:
        16.53.3.3.1. Control fuel distribution and the SPR drain pump.
     16.53.3.4. Loadmaster: The LM is responsible for supervising fuel servicing operations.
        16.53.3.4.1. Ensure compliance with all safety procedures.
        16.53.3.4.2. Immediately inform the pilot and advise the crew on recommended
        course of action, in the event of a hazardous situation/emergency.
 228                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


          16.53.3.4.3. Ensure all required equipment is on board prior to and after Hot
          Refueling operations.
          16.53.3.4.4. Operate the ramp and door or paratroop door as required.
          16.53.3.4.5. Complete the hot brake/hung flare check prior to commencing hot
          refueling operations.
          16.53.3.4.6. Ensure that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures.
          16.53.3.4.7. Connect the fuel source to SPR panel.
          16.53.3.4.8. Perform leak check at SPR panel.
          16.53.3.4.9. Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are
          aboard.
   16.53.4. Internal Communications. Voice communication contact between the LM and
   cockpit will be maintained at all times. The LM does not have to maintain interphone contact
   while positioning/repositioning refueling equipment, but will be on interphone any time the
   refueling nozzle is connected to the aircraft and the switches on the Fuel Management Panel
   are in a position other than off or closed.
   16.53.5. Bonding procedures. If a ground is not available at a FOL or remote site, aircraft
   will be bonded to servicing equipment during actual servicing. Bonding will be accomplished
   by inserting the bonding plug into the receiver aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other
   action.
   16.53.6. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are published in the amplified
   checklist contained within Attachment 2. They will be reviewed by all crewmembers and
   briefed by the PIC prior to commencing Hot Refueling operations. All personnel, including
   ground controllers, will know the ground evacuation plans. Stop all Hot Refueling operations
   immediately when a leak, unsafe condition, or system malfunction occurs. Correct the
   deficiency before resuming hot refueling operations.
16.54. FARP Operations.
   16.54.1. General. For ACC aircrews, FARP is a tactical ground refueling operation that can
   be performed by the HC-130J with engines running to a fixed/rotary-wing/tilt-rotor aircraft
   or fuel bladders/vehicles. FARP may be used to extend the combat radius/loiter time of the
   receiver. FARP is normally conducted at night in austere environments with engines running
   and includes fuel transfer from aircraft fuel tanks through the SPR panel or the Rapid Ground
   Refueling (RGR) port to the receiver. All equipment and personnel required to set-up the
   FARP site are assigned to the tanker aircraft.
   16.54.2. Planning Factors: Planners must be aware of factors which limit FARP
   employment and should consider the following when including a FARP option in an exercise
   or contingency: WARNING: All FARP sites will have a current site survey and meet the
   minimum unobstructed egress distance required by the survey to ensure the aircraft can taxi
   from the site in the event of an emergency. If the egress distance is less than the required
   minimum or the egress area is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform
   refueling/defueling in a cold environment only.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  229


     16.54.2.1. Fire protection equipment will be available IAW AFI 11-235, Forward Area
     Refueling Point Operations, and meets the requirements of TO 00-25-172, Ground
     Servicing and Static Grounding/Bonding.
     16.54.2.2. All Air Force personnel involved will be trained IAW appropriate command
     directives.
     16.54.2.3. Passengers. Personnel and equipment may be on/off-loaded in conjunction
     with refueling operations. Personnel movement on or off the aircraft should be monitored
     to maintain accountability in case of an emergency.
  16.54.3. Responsibilities. Only current and qualified crewmembers will be allowed to
  occupy a primary crew position on FARP missions. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in
  training under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor. NOTE: The Pilot,
  Copilot, and CSO will remain on the flight deck in the event of an emergency taxi, i.e.
  moving the aircraft.
     16.54.3.1. The PIC is responsible for the overall safety of the crew and the aircraft hot
     refueling operations. The PIC relies on the LM to announce any unusual situations and to
     recommend the best course of action.
     16.54.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will:
        16.54.3.2.1. Ensure approval has been granted by the proper authority prior to
        conducting FARP operations.
        16.54.3.2.2. Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities.
        16.54.3.2.3. Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking
        action. Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay FARP operations.
        16.54.3.2.4. Analyze planned FARP area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances.
        16.54.3.2.5. Determine fuel requirements to include estimated on-load and off-load.
     16.54.3.3. The Panel Operator (PO) is normally the CSO. They will:
        16.54.3.3.1. Control fuel distribution and the SPR drain pump.
     16.54.3.4. Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) is the LM. There will be two HRS’s during
     all FARP operations. The primary HRS is responsible for supervising fuel servicing
     operations and ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures. The
     secondary HRS will be standing near the SPR/RGR port to observe the hose connection
     and be standing by to disconnect the hose in case of an emergency,
        16.54.3.4.1. The HRS has a thorough knowledge of all equipment and systems and
        how they operate. HRS will also be PO certified.
        16.54.3.4.2. Has a thorough knowledge of and observes all safety procedures.
        16.54.3.4.3. Has a thorough knowledge of and follows the sequential steps for each
        operation. NOTE: The right paratroop door will remain open during FARP
        operations.
        16.54.3.4.4. A HRS will position an inter-phone cord near the right paratroop door
        NOTE: During hose deployment, the HRS’s will assist the HDP deploying the hoses.
230                              AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


         16.54.3.4.5. A HRS will instruct the PO when to dispense or shut-off fuel flow by
         interphone, monitor for fuel leaks and periodically scan the tanker wings.
         16.54.3.4.6. In the event of a hazardous situation/emergency, a HRS will
         immediately inform the PO and advise the crew on recommended course of action.
         When the FARP operation is complete, the HRS’s will assist the HDPs with the tear
         down of the FARP site and the primary HRS assumes interphone contact.
         16.54.3.4.7. The HRSs secure the aircraft for departure after all equipment and
         personnel are aboard.
         16.54.3.4.8. The primary HRS will brief who will operate the ramp and door,
         paratroop door, and canary slides/ground loading ramps. A HRS, upon landing and
         after clearance from the pilot, will open the cargo ramp. Upon clearance from the
         pilot to offload the HRS will lower the cargo ramp to the ground. A HRS will exit the
         aircraft through the ramp and door to perform the hot brake /hung flare checks and to
         clear personnel off the aircraft to establish the FARP site.
         16.54.3.4.9. The primary HRS will be positioned so as to have an unobstructed view
         of the entire FARP operation.
         16.54.3.4.10. Upon clearance from the primary HRS, the secondary HRS and HDP
         will exit the aircraft and deploy the tanker end of the refueling hose towards the SPR
         panel/RGR port.
         16.54.3.4.11. The secondary HRS monitors the refueling hose to prevent the HDP
         from possibly damaging the hose/connector. Once hose layout is complete, position
         the fire extinguisher and water container next to the SPR panel/RGR port. The
         secondary HRS then connects to the prepositioned inter-phone cord. CAUTION: In
         the event the aircraft must depart immediately, the PO must immediately discontinue
         refueling by placing all the transfer pumps, IFR pumps, and valve switches to the
         OFF/CLOSED position. The secondary HRS must confirm the SPR Valve/pod supply
         valve position with the PO to ensure no fuel is pressurizing the hoses prior to
         disconnecting the SPR nozzle. NOTE: The HRSs and HDP at each refueling point
         will perform an on-scene inspection of the pressurized system for leaks, slippage of
         fuel hoses from hose couplings and general condition of hoses. Hoses that leak or
         have blistering, saturation or cuts/abrasions which expose the reinforcement material
         shall be removed from service.
         16.54.3.4.12. To drain the residual fuel from the refueling hoses, pressure will be
         relieved from the refueling hose IAW applicable directives.           CAUTION: The
         secondary HRS disconnects the SPR nozzle after confirming with the PO the SPR
         Valve/pod fuel valve position to ensure no fuel is pressurizing the hoses.
         16.54.3.4.13. After all hoses have been rolled/stowed to the low (suction) side of the
         pump, turn the pump off and disconnect the hose. The 10’ section can be evacuated
         by use of the SPR drain pump and holding the hose over head. Some residual fuel
         will remain in this section of hose.
      16.54.3.5. Hose Deployment Personnel (HDP). Air Force fuels personnel (AFSC
      2FOXl) will be included in the FARP crew and will deploy/redeploy fuel hoses.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 231


     Minimum HDPs will be one person for each receiver point. The personnel designated as
     HDPs will deploy hoses from the aircraft and set up the refueling points,
  16.54.4. FARP Equipment. FARP requires specific equipment and inspections prior to
  commencing operations. Only equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO 37A9-7-2-1,
  and in the system safety engineering analysis (SSEA) shall be used. This equipment is unique
  in that it provides for an internal bond that is not provided for with conventional refueling
  equipment. If unapproved equipment is used, the refueling operation must be accomplished
  without engines running (cold refueling).
     16.54.4.1. Unisex couplings. Each coupler has a two-position handle for Flow or No
     Flow. Connection and disconnection are only possible when the handles of both couplers
     are in the No Flow position. In the No Flow position, the internal ball valve is locked
     closed to prevent fuel spillage. Approximately 15cc of fuel may spill when disconnecting
     the coupler assembly. The Unisex coupling provides the following unique features:
         16.54.4.1.1. Provides fuel shut off and disconnects with dry break capability at each
         coupling.
         16.54.4.1.2. Eliminates the concern for male/female connection relationship of FARP
         components.
         16.54.4.1.3. Fuel spillage during set-up and tear-down of equipment is minimized to
         less than 15cc fluid loss when couplings are disconnected.
         16.54.4.1.4. The couplings cannot be connected or disconnected while either valve is
         open. The handle dual safety lock prevents inadvertent valve opening while
         disconnected and pressurized.
         16.54.4.1.5. Valve design provides straight through flow for maximum flow rate with
         minimal pressure loss. Valves can be opened with full line pressure when connected.
         Valves can be shut off while the system is pressurized should it be necessary to
         isolate or bypass any section of the FARP layout.
         16.54.4.1.6. Dust Caps provide a seal against dust and dirt when installed. The
         common face seal used on caps may be used as a spare should coupling seal become
         damaged. Caps will be connected together for seal and dirt protection when not
         connected to couplings.      NOTE: The dust cap seal and coupling seal have a
         tendency to stick together. When removing dust cap, check that only one seal is
         installed in the coupling. Failure to adhere to this note will make other connections
         difficult or impossible.
         16.54.4.1.7. Electrical conductivity is provided throughout the connected system.
     16.54.4.2. Fueling hose. The hose is a lay-flat, lightweight, continuous length, flexible
     design with an abrasive resistant sheath cover. The hose features a khaki green color
     polyurethane elastomer tube. The textile reinforcement contains 4 continuous length
     copper wires to provide an electrical bond between the hose and end couplings. The
     abrasion resistant outer sheath is woven from polyester and is coated with black
     polyurethane to increase abrasion resistance and provide the required flat black color.
     Operating pressure for the hose is 300 psi with a burst pressure of 600 psi. Hoses that
     have been re-coupled must maintain 90 percent of original hose length. NOTE: Avoid
232                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      crimping a pressurized hose and dragging it on the crimped end. This will cause damage
      to the hose.
         16.54.4.2.1. Kinks and short loops in refueling hose shall be avoided.
         16.54.4.2.2. Do not drag fuel nozzles and hose couplers along the ground
         unnecessarily. NOTE: Each continuous length hose assembly has a Unisex ball
         coupler. Hoses can be connected to nozzles and hose reels by aligning the coupler
         lugs and rotating. Dust caps are supplied and must be connected together to prevent
         contamination. NOTE: Hoses that have abrasion through the sheath (detected by
         seeing the khaki green underlying hose) will be repaired by replacing the sheath.
         Hoses that have been cut and re-coupled must maintain 90 percent of original length.
         NOTE: The dust cap seal and coupling seal have a tendency to stick together. When
         removing dust cap, check that only one seal is installed in coupling. Failure to adhere
         to this note will make other connections difficult or impossible.
      16.54.4.3. Unisex Fittings. The “T” and “X” fittings are used for connecting hoses
      together and directing fuel flow. Each fitting has a coupling with a two position handle
      for flow/no flow. Connect/disconnect is possible only when the handles of both coupling
      halves are in the no flow position. In the no flow position, the internal ball valve is
      locked closed to prevent fuel spillage. An interlock locks the coupling halves together to
      prevent accidental disconnect and fuel spillage. No more than 15cc of fuel will spill when
      disconnecting these items. Each coupling has identical manually operated ball valves on
      each end of the assembly. Coupling assemblies are connected by aligning lugs and
      rotating. Dust caps will be attached and in place when hose assembly is stored.
      16.54.4.4. SPR Nozzle. The SPR nozzle provides a leak tight connection for aircraft
      fueling. Nozzles that are attached to the tanker aircraft will have a 60-mesh strainer. This
      is the only means of filtering out solid particles of contamination before they reach the
      receiver aircraft. If the nozzle is to be used as a tanker nozzle, remove the strainer. This
      reduces the pressure drop and prevents contamination from collecting outside on the
      strainer element and inadvertently being pumped into a receiver aircraft at a later date.
         16.54.4.4.1. To connect the nozzle to the aircraft receptacle remove the dust cap from
         the nozzle face, connect the nozzle to the adapter and turn clockwise. Turn the nozzle
         handle to the FLOW position. To disconnect the nozzle, turn the handle to the NO
         FLOW position, turn the nozzle counterclockwise and remove it from the adapter.
         Place the dust cap on the nozzle face down to secure it to the nozzle. Nozzle bonding
         plugs will be connected to bonding receptacles prior to connecting/inserting the
         nozzle to receiver aircraft.
         16.54.4.4.2. Always bond the nozzle to the aircraft before the fill cap is removed.
         This connection should remain in place until after the cap is replaced. Failure to
         perform this procedure can cause a static spark at the tank fill opening. NOTE:
         Prior to applying fuel pressure to the system, ensure the nozzle is securely locked by
         manually attempting to remove the nozzle with the valve in the FLOW position. If the
         nozzle can be removed, it is defective and must be removed from service.
      16.54.4.5. RGR Port. The RGR port is located on the bottom of the aerial refueling pod,
      can be opened to allow fuel to be transferred, via hoses and couplings. Its purpose is to
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 233


     provide a standard connection point for refueling aircraft, vehicles, or fuel storage
     devices on the ground. When using this adapter procedures are similar to using the SPR.
     16.54.4.6. Open-Port/Over Wing Nozzle. The over wing nozzle contains a 60 mesh
     strainer and an automatic shut-off feature. It is regulated to 25 PSI maximum (20 GPM
     max output). Remove dust cap and lift handle to dispense fuel. Automatic shut-off
     feature must be tested prior to deployment by partially filling a grounded drip pan with
     the nozzle immersed in fuel. The automatic shut-off device should stop fuel flow. If
     shut-off feature fails, nozzle will be removed from service
     16.54.4.7. 50 GPM Pump. This pump has a 28 volt DC l/2 HP electric motor and is used
     for defueling the last 200’ of hose by pumping the fuel from the hoses into the tanker
     aircraft.
     16.54.4.8. Squeegees. Squeegees are used to ensure all residual fuel is removed from the
     hose. Squeegees should be used to evacuate fuel from the hose. When squeegees are not
     available, walking and rolling the hose will suffice as an alternate method of draining.
     This alternate method will leave more residual fuel in the hose, increasing its weight.
        16.54.4.8.1. Manual squeegee. The manual squeegee consists of two rollers attached
        to a three foot handle. The squeegee is manually pulled along each individual length
        of the flexible hose.
        16.54.4.8.2. Motorized squeegee. The motorized squeegee consists of two rollers
        that are driven by a battery powered 24 VDC motor. The battery is located inside a
        latched cover above the rollers. All squeegee batteries must be recharged before each
        mission (recharging time is approximately 45 minutes when battery is fully
        discharged). To operate, hold the squeegee handle and pull the forward or reverse
        trigger switch to start the squeegee rollers. Guide squeegee along the length of the
        hose. A fully charged battery will squeegee approximately 1,700 feet of hose before
        the battery is completely discharged. If a squeegee fails electrically while in use, the
        operator can pull the squeegee along the hose to provide defueling. NOTE: If
        squeegee battery appears to be drained or squeegee comes to a stop, release trigger.
        Forcing squeegee to continue will result in overheating of squeegee and/or battery.
        Replace squeegee or allow squeegee to cool for 30 minutes, prior to replacing battery.
        NOTE: Do not operate squeegee within 8 inches of the coupler. Operation closer
        than eight inches to the coupler will damage the hose resulting in a possible fuel spill.
     16.54.4.9. Interphone cord. A 220’ interphone cord will accompany FARP equipment.
     16.54.4.10. Fire extinguisher. A 20 lb dry chemical fire extinguisher will be placed near
     each tanker and receiver refueling point, SPR/RGR port.
     16.54.4.11. Water Container. A 5 gallon water container will be placed near each tanker
     and receiver refueling point, SPR/RGR port. An infrared chemlight will be placed on
     each receiver water container indicating that the refueling point is ready for operation.
  16.54.5. Equipment Maintenance
     16.54.5.1. Hydrostatic testing. FARP hoses will be hydrostatic tested upon receipt,
     annually and after any hose repair or coupler replacement. The entire system, FARP hose
     kit (hoses, couplers, etc.) is connected to a hydrostatic hose tester, and pressurized to 75
234                               AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013


      PSI. Testing procedures are outlined in T.O. 37A-1-10. Operating pressure for the hose
      is 300 PSI and burst pressure is 600 PSI.
      16.54.5.2. Hose maintenance. Defective Fuel hoses may have 10 percent of a hose
      length removed without replacing it with a new hose. Defective hoses that are less than
      90 percent of original length will be removed from service.
      16.54.5.3. Ohms check. The FARP equipment bonds the tanker and receiver aircraft.
      Bonding is accomplished by internal conductors within the hoses. The ohms (resistance)
      check is critical, as the equipment provides the only means of bonding between the tanker
      aircraft and the receiver aircraft. An ohms check will be performed on each hose using a
      multi-meter prior to each FARP mission and each time the equipment is reconfigured
      during that mission. EXCEPTION: When nozzles or hoses are changed out during
      actual ongoing FARP operations.
         16.54.5.3.1. Total resistance values are as follows:
             16.54.5.3.1.1. The maximum allowable resistance for a 100-foot hose with
             couplers is 100 ohms.
             16.54.5.3.1.2. The maximum allowable resistance for a 200-foot hose with
             couplers is 200 ohms.
             16.54.5.3.1.3. The maximum allowable resistance for a 240-foot hose with
             couplers is 240 ohms.
             16.54.5.3.1.4. FAM Cart (if used) maximum allowable resistance 10 ohms.
  16.54.6. Hose Deployment from Aircraft Floor/Ramp.
      16.54.6.1. When deploying hoses for a multi-point site, refer to the FARP site survey for
      proper positioning of equipment. CAUTION: Refueling hoses should only be pulled
      from over the shoulder while walking forward, not backwards.
      16.54.6.2. While deploying hoses, after sufficient resistance is met, lay down hoses and
      return to the aircraft for another length. Repeat this step as necessary until positioning is
      complete. Minimize dragging connections/valves to prevent damage.
      16.54.6.3. When using the RGR port, drag the length of hose towards the SPR panel first
      to ensure proper slack is available for defueling.
      16.54.6.4. After positioning hoses the full distance, the nozzle end is brought back
      approximately 25 feet (50 feet when refueling fixed wing aircraft). HDPs will walk the
      length of the hoses back to the aircraft checking for kinks, twists, and dry break positions.
      16.54.6.5. After HDPs have finished walking the hoses, they will notify the primary
      HRS with a thumbs up signal that the (dry) line check is complete. HDPs will return to
      the aircraft for the fire extinguishers and water containers and return to the “X/T” fitting.
      They will then wait for fuel pressurization to the points.
      16.54.6.6. After the hoses are pressurized, the HDPs will perform a leak check taking the
      water bottle and fire extinguisher along. When the leak check is complete, the fire
      extinguisher and water container are positioned alongside the refueling nozzle at the
      refueling point. The HDP will place an infrared chemlight on the water container, then
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   235


     kneel indicating the point is ready for operation. NOTE: If the point becomes non-
     operational, remove the chemlight from the water container
     16.54.6.7. HDPs will remain at the refueling point to act as fire guard after passing the
     refueling nozzle to the receiver crewmember.
     16.54.6.8. Bonding will be accomplished by inserting the bonding plug from the
     refueling nozzle into the aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other action. Once the
     bond has been made, the HDP will not place the hose on the ground or touch the receiver
     aircraft until the bonding wire is removed.
     16.54.6.9. After the final receiver is fueled, the HDPs will position themselves at each
     refueling point to drain the hose. When using the RGR port, disconnect the nozzle from
     the port and attach to the SPR panel before starting to drain hoses. Stretch hoses to their
     full length and attach the squeegee to drain that segment of hose. After running the
     squeegee over the length of hose and reaching a connection, close both sides of the valve
     and disconnect hose. Install dust caps. Roll that segment of hose. Repeat steps for each
     section of hose. Return hoses to the aircraft.
     16.54.6.10. Squeegees should be used to drain hoses. When squeegees are not available,
     walking and rolling the hoses will suffice as an alternate method of draining. This
     alternate method will leave more residual fuel in the hoses and will increase tear down
     time as well as hose weight. When reaching the fittings, raise the hose and let fuel drain
     from the fitting into the next hose, close both valves while in raised position. When
     reaching the cross connection, only close the valve that is designated for the hose you
     evacuated.
  16.54.7. Internal Communications. During ground operations, communications can be
  difficult due to aircraft noise levels. Interphone discipline is essential so emergency calls may
  be relayed clearly. All unnecessary voice communication is prohibited for safety reasons.
  Voice communication contact between the loadmaster and cockpit will be maintained at all
  times.
     16.54.7.1. FARP operations will not be conducted if interphone contact cannot be
     established and maintained between the HRS, PO. Exception: The HRS may clear off
     interphone to assists the HDPs with the tear down of the FARP site.
  16.54.8. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are published in the amplified
  checklist contained in attachment 2. They will be reviewed by all crewmembers and briefed
  to the crew by the HRS prior to commencing FARP operations. All personnel, including
  ground controllers, will know the ground evacuation plans. Stop all FARP operations
  immediately when a leak, unsafe condition, or system malfunction occurs.

forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and

to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include
authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization,
or unit training.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)—ORM is a logic-based, common sense approach to
making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during, and

load (expressed in tons of cargo or equipment, gallons of liquid, or number of passengers) which
the vehicle is designed to transport under specified conditions of operation, in addition to its
unladen weight.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. The permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e., number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. PICs are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs
inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be imposed
on the PIC for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)
Point of Impact (PI)—The point on the drop zone where the first airdropped parachutist or
cargo item lands or is expected to land.

be in the aircraft and prepared for flight. Passengers will be seated and loads tied down.
Aircrews will have completed briefing and aircraft preflight inspection prior to station time.
Normally, station time will be 30 minutes prior to takeoff time.
Station Time (Airborne)—A specified time when parachutists will be seated in the aircraft with
seat belts fastened. This time normally will be 5 minutes prior to Air Force station time.
Suitable Airfield—Normally, suitable airfields are those which meet weather, fuel, and runway
(Chapter 6) requirements and are within 50 NM of flight plan course centerline.
Tactical Control (TACON)—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the
detailed and, usually, local direction and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to
accomplish missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control is inherent to OPCON. Tactical control
may be delegated to and exercised at any level at or below the level of combatant command.
Time Out—Common assertive statement to voice crewmember concern when safety may be
jeopardized.
Time Over Target (TOT)—The actual time an aircraft is at a geographic point or area carrying
out an assigned mission.

WARNING: When cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 feet MSL, all crewmembers will continuously
breathe oxygen provided by the airplane oxygen system. If any persons experience signs of
decompression sickness/or unusual pain, follow the high altitude airdrop emergency procedures.
NOTES:
A cabin altitude check will be accomplished at a cabin altitude of 10,000 and 15,000 feet MSL.
At a cabin altitude of 20,000 feet MSL, this step will be accomplished every 15 minutes or with
each 5,000 foot increase in altitude, whichever is first, and will be accomplished every 5 minutes
above 30,000 feet MSL.
Parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flight up to 13,000
feet MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes per
sortie. Under circumstances other than these, jumpers will use supplemental oxygen. When
supplemental oxygen is required for parachutists, a check of the oxygen console, connections,
pressure, and quantity is required. The loadmaster will confirm that the cargo compartment
crewmembers have completed this action by receiving a thumbs up indication from each person.

NOTES: The PF will initiate this checklist by briefing the pattern and delivery to be flown.
If the PRE-SEARCH checklist has already been accomplished and the aircraft configuration will
not be changed for the delivery pattern, e.g., flap settings and/or door, rescue equipment drops
can commence immediately. On each pattern flown, the PF should call downwind, turning base,
turning final, and the type of deployment pattern being flown (e.g., “Turning base for MA-1 kit,”
“Turning final for parabundle”). The loadmaster will acknowledge the PF’s calls for situational
awareness and crew coordination.

                                 (JMD/PJ, JMD/RAMZ/ATV)
NOTES: This checklist will be used for jumpmaster directed (JMD) airdrops and pararescue
deployment (PJD)/equipment airdrops utilizing the fixed, moving, and crosswind target patterns.
The PF will initiate this checklist by calling for the “PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT
CHECKLIST.” No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will allow the
jumpmaster access to the door to begin “spotting procedures.” When the jumpmaster is off
interphone, the loadmaster will relay all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster to the pilot.
The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door; however, the aircraft ramp
and paratroop door(s) will not be opened simultaneously during personnel airdrops.

3. Turn on Final
WARNING: If any crewmember calls “No Drop” after the “One Minute Warning” call, no
deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist will be re-initiated. Upon
hearing a “No Drop” call, the PM will turn the red light on and, along with the loadmaster,
acknowledge the “No Drop.” For a RAMZ/ATV bundle “No Drop,” avoid abrupt maneuvers
and make all turns as level as possible as the equipment is restrained by the release gate only at
this point.

WARNING: Jumpmasters will run their Safety Checks; the loadmaster is responsible for
accomplishing all other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo compartment.
When either the loadmaster or jumpmaster responds “SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE,” this
indicates that both the personnel/equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed on all
jumpers exiting this pass.
5. "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"                                                                  LM/JM
NOTE: When the PF responds “CLEAR TO JUMP,” this indicates that all conditions are
favorable for personnel deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point.
6. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                                                PF
NOTE: The PM will turn on the green light. Perform this step for live passes only. For
streamer/spotter or observations, leave the red light turned on.

NOTE: When using PJ JMD Fixed or Moving Target Patterns, make minor heading changes to
pass over spotter chute and the target on a direct line. Establish drift correction prior to passing
over the Spotter Chute. The JM will reverse count over the target.
8. Fly streamer to Target (if required)                                                           PF

NOTES: At the completion of the reverse count (PJ fixed or moving target pattern only) or
when the aircraft is in a direct line with the target and spotter chute (PJ crosswind target pattern
drop), the jumpmaster will release the jumpers and/or equipment. For JMD airdrops where the
JM is verbally directing the aircraft the JM will release the jumpers when reaching the release
point.
10. Release jumpers and/or equipment                                                              JM

WARNING: When cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 feet MSL, all crewmembers will continuously
breathe oxygen provided by the airplane oxygen system. If any persons experience signs of
decompression sickness/or unusual pain, follow the high altitude airdrop emergency procedures.
NOTES: A cabin altitude check will be accomplished at a cabin altitude of 10,000 and 15,000
feet MSL. At a cabin altitude of 20,000 feet MSL, this step will be accomplished every 15
minutes or with each 5,000 foot increase in altitude, whichever is first, and will be accomplished
every 5 minutes above 30,000 feet MSL. Parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen
during unpressurized flight up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet
MSL does not exceed 30 minutes per sortie. Under circumstances other than these, jumpers will
use supplemental oxygen. When supplemental oxygen is required for parachutists, a check of
the oxygen console, connections, pressure, and quantity is required. The loadmaster will confirm
that the cargo compartment crewmembers have completed this action by receiving a thumbs up
indication from each person. When oxygen is not required, the loadmaster(s) will don their
helmet IAW MAJCOM directives.

                         MA-1 KIT, PARABUNDLE, AND FREEFALL
NOTES: The PF will initiate this checklist by briefing the pattern and delivery to be flown.
If the PRE-SEARCH checklist has already been accomplished and the aircraft configuration will
not be changed for the delivery pattern, e.g., flap settings and/or door, rescue equipment drops
can commence immediately.
On each pattern flown, the PF should call downwind, turning base, turning final, and the type of
deployment pattern being flown (e.g., “Turning base for MA-1 kit,” “Turning final for
parabundle”). The LM will acknowledge the PF’s calls for situational awareness and crew
coordination.

NOTES:
This checklist will be used for jumpmaster directed (JMD) airdrops and pararescue deployment
(PJD)/equipment airdrops utilizing the fixed, moving, and crosswind target patterns. The PF will
initiate this checklist by calling for the “PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST.”
No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster
access to the door to begin “spotting procedures.” When the jumpmaster is off interphone, the
loadmaster will relay all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster to the pilot. The
jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door; however, the aircraft ramp and
paratroop door(s) will not be opened simultaneously during personnel airdrops.
1. “PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST”                                          `                   PF
2. “ACKNOWLEDGED”                                                                               LM
WARNING: If any crewmember calls “No Drop” after the “One Minute Warning” call, no
deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist will be re-initiated. Upon
hearing a “No Drop” call, the PM will turn the red light on and, along with the loadmaster,
acknowledge the “No Drop.” For a RAMZ/ATV bundle “No Drop,” avoid abrupt maneuvers
and make all turns as level as possible as the equipment is restrained by the release gate only at
this point.
NOTE: Jumpers may move aft of the ramp hinge at jumpmasters discretion after the ONE
MINUTE WARNING is called.
3. "CREW, ONE MINUTE WARNING"                                                                    PF
4. Load Release Gate                                  Checked
WARNING: Upon hearing a “NO DROP” call, the PM will turn the red light on and, along with
the loadmaster, acknowledge the “NO DROP”. If the CRL is held in place by only the release
gate strap, all personnel on the cargo ramp will move forward of the forward most load, except
the loadmaster and jumpmaster who will monitor the CRL for possible shifting and secure as
necessary.
5. Aft Restraint                                      Removed (as required)
WARNINGS:
Jumpmasters will run their Safety Checks; the loadmaster is responsible for accomplishing all
other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo compartment. When either the
loadmaster or jumpmaster responds “SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE,” this indicates that both
the personnel/equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed on all jumpers exiting
this pass.
Each jumper is responsible for monitoring their own static line. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster
will monitor the jumpmaster’s static line at all times unless preparing the CRL or equipment for
deployment.
During paratroop door static line drops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the
center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737). Personnel in the cargo compartment during
tailgate drops will not position themselves below the static line retriever cable while the cargo
ramp and door are open.
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_AETCSUP_I 12 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                       267

WARNING: When the PF responds “CLEAR TO JUMP”, this indicates that all conditions are
favorable for personnel deployment. If any crewmember calls “NO DROP” after the “ONE
MINUTE WARNING” call, no deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the
checklist will be reinitiated.
NOTE: After hearing “CLEAR TO JUMP”, the loadmaster will alert the jumpmaster and relay
all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster to the PF. The PM will turn on the green light.
7. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                                                  PF

WARNING: Before cutting the gate, the loadmaster will ensure the jumpmaster has moved
forward of the CRL package. No person will be aft of the package during gate cut and
deployment. If the CRL exits the aircraft but fails to properly deploy (hangs up), the static lines
will be cut immediately.
CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free
through the floor tiedown rings.
NOTE: The jumpmaster will signal the loadmaster to cut the release gate. The loadmaster will
not cut the gate until he receives this signal. If jumpers are tailgating, this signals that they are
clear to follow the load. When jumpers use freefall parachutes they will not deploy until after
the loadmaster retrieved the CRL stat lines/parachute D-bags. It may take up to 20 seconds for
all equipment and personnel to exit the aircraft.

NOTE: If personnel drops are complete or if the aircraft or door configuration will be changed,
the pilot will call for the POST-DEPLOYMENT Checklist. If additional drops are planned,
continue with the racetrack patterns and PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT Checklist. Deploy
additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established by the jumpmaster. Disregard
the spotter chute.
13. Jumpmaster/Safety                                  Notify (if required)
            POST-SEARCH/POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (Loadmaster)
NOTES:
For multiple drops, the POST-SEARCH/POST-DEPLOYMENT Checklist is not required until
after completion of the last drop, but each pattern and delivery will be briefed. As a minimum,
brief the type of equipment to be delivered, delivery method (shape, relationship to wind, etc.),
altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used and required actions for malfunctions.
This checklist must be accomplished prior to initiating a non-search/deployment checklist

   A2.5.5. Hot Refueling/FARP Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are not an
   exact science. Common sense and sound judgment should prevail. However, crews should
   follow guidelines during hot refueling operations. Remember that the LM, HRS, and HDP
   are the eyes and ears of the crew during all hot refueling operations. Escape routes should be
   established for each aircraft in the event of an emergency. The escape route should be
   depicted on the hot refueling site survey and must be reviewed prior to the mission. Crews
   must monitor radios to ensure they receive any evacuation call and must be ready to break
   radio silence and notify other participants in the event they experience an emergency.

       A2.5.5.1. The emergency signal for stopping fuel flow is arm and hand extended level
       with shoulder, palm downward, moving from left to right in front of the body. At night,
       the same procedure will be used while holding an overt/covert chemlight.

CAUTION: Contact of fuel to human skin causes minor burns, irritation and loss of body oils.
Immediately remove all fuel soaked clothing and wash affected areas thoroughly. Put clean
clothing on and seal fuel soaked clothes in a plastic bag. Clothing splashed or soaked with fuel
will not be worn on aircraft due to combustion and fume hazard.
NOTE: If it is determined that the leak is not repairable, terminate refueling operation.
