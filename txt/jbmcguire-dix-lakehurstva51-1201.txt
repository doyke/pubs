                 Alternative Dispute Resolution




                  Breaking Barriers; Building Bridges
                                Do you have a dispute,
                            conflict or misunderstanding
                           with your supervisor, co-worker,
                                 or other colleague?

               Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) can help civilian
               and military personnel resolve work related issues in a
                 timely, private, and confidential manner; creating a
                professional work environment. A neutral third party
               can help members find common ground and reach an
                   agreeable solution to resolve differences and/or
                                  misunderstandings.
