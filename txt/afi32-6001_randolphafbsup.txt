NOTE: * Limited to one deputy commander per group.

2.20.4.4. (Added-Randolph AFB) Because of the large number of different staff organizations
on Randolph AFB, a general officer (GO) may be assigned to the base in excess of normal
authorization of GO positions. When this occurs, that GO is automatically K&E without regard
to the office designation involved.

2.20.4.5. (Added-Randolph AFB) Organizations place duty positions on the K&E list because
the presence of the incumbent on base is considered essential to mission accomplishment and not
a matter of convenience. Accordingly, incumbents are expected to occupy the government
quarters made available to them. Waivers require a letter from the organizational commander in
question to the 12 FTW/CC and may result in the position being removed from the K&E list.
