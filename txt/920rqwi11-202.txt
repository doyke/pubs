instruction is applicable to all aircrew members and all aircraft maintenance personnel. This
instruction establishes procedures for parking, launch, and recovery of explosives-loaded
aircraft. Additionally, this instruction will outline procedures for recovery of aircraft with
Jammed Guns and Hung Ordnance. The intent of this instruction is to maximize safety and
minimize the probability of an incident involving explosives-loaded aircraft.
Coordination/approval at the 920 RQW will be accomplished by an electronically signed AF
Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request (AF Form 673). Do not use e-mails for
final coordination/approval, but all e-mails will be maintained as part of the record set. Refer

     1.1. An aircraft will be considered explosives-loaded if it meets criteria set forth in T.O.
     11A-1-33 section 4.
     1.2. A jammed aircraft gun is one whose firing chamber cannot be fully cleared or safety
     devices cannot be properly installed prior to return to base.
     1.3. Hung ordnance will be defined as munitions which were not expended through normal
     operation.
     1.4. Partially ejected munitions is a munitions item that has not fully expended. An Infra-red
     Flare which is visibly extending out of a Countermeasures Magazine is an example of this.
     1.5. Unsafe Munitions is munitions that cannot be safed electrically or mechanically i.e.
     Mk25’s and LUU 4/B’s.
2. Parking:
     2.1. Explosives-loaded aircraft to include those being loaded or unloaded with explosives
     may only be parked in designated locations in accordance with Patrick AFB site plan. A
     concerted effort will be made to adhere to Quantity-Distance (Q-D) requirements. Aircraft
     must be clearly identified to personnel working on or around them.
     2.2. Helicopters on alert status may be loaded and parked within Hangars 750 and 751 with
     pyrotechnic in accordance with (IAW) MOI921-201 920th MXS Weapons Section.
3. Launching Aircraft (A/C):
     3.1. Aircraft will be safed electrically and mechanically at all times while in the a/c parking
     area and while taxiing. Safing devices will not be removed until the a/c reaches the
     designated arming/training areas.
4. EOR:
     4.1. EOR will be preformed by aircrew members at the recovery area with established
     aircrew checklist.
5. Recovery:
     5.1. Gun malfunctions will be cleared before leaving the training area; if a gun malfunction
     can not be cleared it will be considered a jammed gun. All aircraft returning from gun
     missions with jammed guns will proceed directly to Hot Gun designated location in
     accordance with 45 SW13-203 Paragraph 6.10, see attachment 2.
     5.2. All explosive loaded aircraft will ensure they have no hung ordnance, partially-ejected
     munitions or unsafe munitions prior to taxiing back to the aircraft parking area.
     5.3. The 39th Rescue Squadron, when loaded with chaff and flares will taxi to an arm/de-
     arm area and inspect for hung ordnance, partially-ejected or unsafe munitions prior to
     returning to aircraft parking area.

  of Flying (SOF) if discovered in flight or if discovered on the ground the Maintenance
  Operations Center (MOC). Command Post will coordinate the appropriate 45th Space Wing
  Offices involved. Maintenance Operations Center will coordinate with the following
  applicable agencies; Patrick Air Force Base (PAFB) Fire Department, Explosive Ordnance
  Disposal (EOD) and 920th Rescue Wing sections; Weapons Section, Safety Office, Crew
  Chief Flight and the Quality Assurance Office.
  6.3. The aircraft will be shut down, chocked grounded and cordoned off until EOD
  determines that the aircraft is safed.
