                                   Inspector General Complaint System
1. The Air Force has a good complaint system. You can get help quickly and fairly when you ask a question. You can make your complaint at any level and
        you donâ€™t have to worry about being intimidated when you ask for help. No one may take an action against you just because you complained. If you
        think an action has been taken against you because you complained, you should tell an inspector or Inspector General ( IG).
2. The AF IG Complaint Program also includes Fraud, Waste & Abuse, and is described in AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution. The
        regulation tells you how to submit a complaint and who you should talk to. You may go to an inspector or IG at any level, but experience has shown
        that complaints can best be solved by commanders and supervisors. For this reason, although not required, you are encouraged to discuss your
        problem with your supervisor or commander before coming to the IG.
