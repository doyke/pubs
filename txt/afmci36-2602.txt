                                   GENERAL GUIDELINES

1.1. Air Force Policy. It is AF policy to design, administer, and support advancement
opportunities for lower-grade level civilian employees throughout the DoD. The Maintenance
Workforce Development Program (MWDP) is designed to help employees reach their full
potential and fulfill the AF mission. Employees with potential, but lacking qualifications, can be
helped to become qualified for current or projected positions through competitive selection for
mission-supportive job experience and through job-related training and education. The guidance
provided in this instruction is to be implemented in concert with the AF Regionalized Merit
Promotion Program (MPP). This policy is carried out without regard to race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age, physical or mental disability, or other non-merit factor.
1.2. Background. The Government Employees Training Act (Chapter 41, Title 5, USC) is the
legal basis for setting up training and educational programs to broaden opportunities for lower-
grade level employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Act of 1972 (Public Law
92-261) requires agencies to set up training and educational programs designed to develop
employees’ competencies so they may perform at their highest potential.

                            SAMPLE TRAINING AGREEMENT

A2.1. Part I - Training Agreement
   A2.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this agreement is to establish the requirements and
   responsibilities for the training and promotion of selected personnel. The program provides
   the Trainee with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to progress from the
   entry or developmental level to the full performance target grade level. This program
   provides promotional opportunity to Trainees seeking career advancement in a career group
   or pay schedule. The Training Agreement will be signed by the Trainee, Supervisor, and
   Squadron Commander/Division Chief acknowledging their responsibilities and program
   requirements. A scanned copy of the Training Agreement will be forwarded to the Base
   Personnel Office within 90-days of Trainee’s assignment to this program where it will be
   maintained IAW AFI36-114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
A2.2. Selection Procedures. The Trainee has applied for and has been competitively selected
to fill a developmental position which requires a Training Agreement and Formal Training Plan.
A2.3. Training Requirements. The training is designed to provide the knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to perform the target duties and responsibilities. The courses will provide the
Trainee with the knowledge of the principles, processes, procedures, and responsibilities. In
addition, the on-the-job (OJT) portion will provide the practical application of the knowledge the
Trainee has acquired in the courses. Training will be provided by classroom instruction, formal
and informal briefings, computer based and/or web-based technologies, and OJT. This training
program will also provide employees with the opportunity to acquire the experience, knowledge,
skills, and abilities necessary to qualify for the targeted grade.
   A2.3.1. Classroom Instruction. The Base Education & Training Office, commercial vendor
   training providers, local colleges and organizational personnel will provide this method of
   training delivery.
   A2.3.2. OJT. Experienced higher-grade employees, leads, and Supervisors (all referred to as
   Trainers) will provide traditional OJT or structured OJT (SOJT) to the Trainee. OJT is
   hands-on or “over-the-shoulder” training that provides the knowledge and skills required to
   successfully perform a process/task in accordance with the applicable procedures. The
   Trainer conducting the OJT must train the Trainee on all aspects of the process/task to
   include methodology, procedures, process, and local guidance.
A2.4. Training Procedures. The Supervisor will provide the Trainee a copy of the official
master Formal Training Plan (FTP) that outlines the required training. The Supervisor will retain
the original signed master FTP and process/task listing. The Trainee and the OJT Trainer will
initial each required process/task (in the Master FTP) when the Trainer has successfully trained
the process/task and the Trainee has demonstrated the required proficiency level. The Supervisor
must verify the Trainee’s proficiency level prior to initialing the master FTP. In cases where the
Supervisor serves as the OJT Trainer, he/she will initial in both the Trainer and Supervisor
columns. Successful training and development of the Trainee is the primary responsibility of the
Supervisor. The Supervisor must ensure the Trainee is provided the opportunity to complete all
required training. Priority will be placed on ensuring work processes/tasks outlined in the master
AFMCI36-2602 1 MARCH 2013                                                                       17


FTP is accomplished within a timely manner. When practicable, the Trainee will be assigned to
work with a qualified journeyman to ensure proper training and proficiency is achieved.
A2.5. Progress Evaluations. During the training period, informal, subjective, and objective
observations will be made by the assigned Supervisor and Trainer/lead personnel to determine
how well the Trainee is progressing to the desired competencies in the training program.
Progression is based on the Trainee’s commitment to learn the duties and perform the job, attend
and complete classroom instruction, and the Trainee’s ability to achieve the required process/task
proficiency levels identified in the FTP. At a minimum, the Trainee and Supervisor will meet
quarterly or when requested by the Trainee, to discuss the Trainee’s progress and performance.
The Trainee or Supervisor can request the Trainer(s) attendance at the Trainee’s quarterly
review. The Supervisor will document the meeting in the Trainee’s training records using AFMC
Form 362. The Base Personnel Office will be notified of Trainee’s who fail to make satisfactory
progress in the program. An unsatisfactory evaluation by the Supervisor may be sufficient cause
for program extension or Trainee’s removal from the MWDP program.
   A2.5.1. Upon completion of each targeted grade level training, the completed training
   checklist will be forwarded to the Base Personnel Office. The verification statements and
   Supervisor’s recommendation for promotion, located at the end of each FTP checklist, will
   be signed by the Trainee and Supervisor.
A2.6. Incomplete Training, Unsatisfactory Evaluation, or Trainee Withdrawal. The
Trainee may be returned to the Trainee’s previous permanent occupational series and grade, but
not necessarily to the previous position if the Trainee does not complete all training requirements
and/or is unable to demonstrate task proficiency at the required level, the Trainee requests to
withdraw from the program, or there is an elimination of the workload that directly affects the
target position. During the training period, Trainees will be excluded from promotion
consideration up to and including the target grade of the position held. The removal of the
Trainee from the Maintenance Workforce Development Program (MWDP) will not affect the
Trainee’s ability to participate in future MWDP programs.
A2.7. Program Length. The program length is a minimum of 24 months (GS-11 minimum 36
months) but can be extended by the ALC training chief. Requirements of Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Title 5, Part 300.604, will be followed for progression to the next target
grade. This progression will not be granted prior to the individual meeting the training
requirements outlined in this FTP with the exception of the provisions under CFR Title 5, Part
353. Trainees must satisfactorily complete minimum training hours established by their FTP
checklist. Supervisors may request the program be extended when, the Trainee is not performing
at the expected developmental level.
   A2.7.1. Trainees requesting to withdraw must submit a letter to the immediate Supervisor.
   Withdrawal requests must be processed to the Base Personnel Office, through the Trainee’s
   Squadron/Division, and address the reasons and justification for the withdrawal request.
   A2.7.2. Once the Trainee has completed the targeted grade level training requirements
   within the guidelines of this agreement, the Trainee will be promoted or converted to the
   position consistent with the guidelines of this agreement, applicable laws, and regulations.
