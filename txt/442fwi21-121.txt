SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction implements guidelines that clarify the roles of the Aircraft Maintenance
Squadron (AMXS), Maintenance Operation Flight (MOF), Repair and Reclamation (R&R)
Flight Chief, Crash Recovery Team and Team Chief and the 509th Bomb Wing (BW) as
instructed in AFI 21-101, Air Combat Command, United States Air Forces in Europe and Pacific
Air Forces Supplement, Whiteman Air Force Base Supplement located on the Whiteman
SharePoint and Tenant support agreement. It also updates information in Attachment 1 of this
Instruction. This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Generalized CDDAR Responsibilities.
     1.1. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate
     safety practices to minimize their effect. There is an infinite variety of possible emergency
     and crash recovery situations; therefore, specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every
     situation. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the disaster control group to
     the Incident Commander (IC). Practice through participation in wing crash recovery
     exercises and implementation of operational risk management techniques are imperative for
     all emergency and crash recovery operations.
     1.2. CDDAR recovery program applies to all host and associate flying organizations. It will
     also be used to recover transient aircraft if within the Team Whiteman CDDAR response
     capability. It is designed to recover crashed/damaged or disabled aircraft in a minimum time
     period and return the airfield to operational status consistent with the following
     consideration(s):
        1.2.1. Open runway for operational use.
        1.2.2. Prevent secondary damage to the aircraft.
        1.2.3. Preserve evidence for mishap or accident investigations.
        1.2.4. Mitigate the mishap’s impact on the owning organization’s flying mission
        requirements.
        1.2.5. Input from the flying organizations on their mission requirements must be
        considered.
     1.3. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the Emergency Operations Center
     (EOC) and/or the IC. All operations at the incident location will be under the purview of the
     IC. If incident location is not Department of Defense (DoD)-owned land the IC may be a
     civilian from the owning jurisdiction. Regardless of organizational affiliation, IAW the
     National Incident Management System, the IC will retain all tactical decision making on
     scene.
     1.4. Immediate response by the CDDAR team is required during normal operating periods or
     duty hours. All units will develop emergency recall or mobilization rosters to identify and
     notify required recovery team members outside normal operating hours. Units must also
442FWI21-121 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   3


   account for team members being deployed, temporary duty (TDY) and on leave. See Crash
   Recovery Recall Roster appointment letter, MXG#21-32.
   1.5. The 509th BW Commander (509 BW/CC) or designated representative, with the advice
   and assistance of the IC and aircraft’s flying organization, if possible, determines the removal
   conditions for CDDAR operations which are designated as:
      1.5.1. Emergency. This condition requires immediate runway clearance at the risk of
      losing equipment and evidence.
      1.5.2. Urgent. This condition requires runway clearance as soon as possible after
      completion of rescue, fire fighting and explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) operations.
      The IC will make this determination.
      1.5.3. Routine. This condition allows sufficient time to use recovery techniques to
      minimize further damage to aircraft, preserve evidence and precludes exposing personnel
      or equipment to danger.
   1.6. During all emergency response situations the IC is the final authority for determining
   when the mishap site is safe, and when the investigating authority and/or CDDAR team may
   approach the mishap site and/or conduct recovery operations.
   1.7. The IC will decide which first responder actions may or may not proceed. The IC, in
   consultation with the Airfield Manager, Base Safety Officer (509 BW/SE) and the CDDAR
   Team Chief, will then decide which removal methods are best.
2. Host Base/Tenant Response.
   2.1. General Responsibilities
      2.1.1. The host wing, 509 BW, has overall oversight for recovery of host, tenant, or
      transient crashed or disabled aircraft on Whiteman AFB and coordinating authority for
      off base events. Since tenant units are responsible for the condition/repair of assigned
      aircraft, tenant units must be actively involved in assisting the host base in recovery
      operations during real world responses. Technical expertise, technical data, mission
      design series (MDS) unique tools/special equipment, expert manpower and airframe
      familiarization are valuable contributions tenant units make to the host CDDAR program.
      2.1.2. CDDAR will be accomplished using a Team Whiteman approach. Team members
      executing CDDAR capability will consist of individuals from 509 BW and all Whiteman
      tenant units with possible CDDAR expertise.              509 Repair and Reclamation
      (MXS/MXMTR) will respond to all in-flight-emergencies (IFE) and on-runway crash or
      disabled aircraft requirements. Team members from the unit responsible for the aircraft
      will be represented during aircraft recovery. If the CDDAR team or owning unit requires
      assistance, qualified members from other tenant units may be requested. This will
      require coordination with tenant wing commanders and may be a Limiting Factor based
      on mission requirements and deployments. Equipment, vehicles, personal protective
      equipment (PPE) and any other CDDAR requirements needed to recover Whiteman
      assigned aircraft will be identified by each tenant flying unit and be made available for
      CDDAR response as needed.
      2.1.3. Host unit provides recovery support to all tenant units as established in support
      agreements (SA) and this instruction. CDDAR procedures will be coordinated through
4                                                         442FWI21-121 26 SEPTEMBER 2013

       operations for all base assigned aircraft, to include tenant aircraft. Tenant units are
       required to provide team personnel, participate in host training exercises and maintain
       specialized equipment inventories. This will require coordination with tenant wing
       commanders and may be a Limiting Factor based on mission requirements and
       deployments.
       2.1.5. Tenant units will coordinate with host for CDDAR recovery support, training,
       exercises and equipment as needed to perform the CDDAR mission.
           2.1.5.1. The 442 FW (Tenant) has the responsibility for specialized aircraft removal

       forklift, aircraft tow vehicle and tow bar, crane 20 or 50 ton as applicable (owned by
       509th R&R), and bulldozer(s).
       2.2.3. The 509 BW Commander, acting as the Installation Commander, is responsible for
       all response elements during incident/contingency operations. As the situation shifts
       away from response to clean-up or investigation, overall command may transfer to other
       units as appropriate.
       2.2.4. The 509 MXS/MXMTR is responsible to the Team Whiteman CDDAR program
       by providing aircraft recovery operations, qualification and training of their assigned
       recovery team members and inspection and maintenance of their assigned equipment
       used for this operation.
       2.2.5. Whiteman AFB assigned organizations will assume CDDAR responsibility unless
       other prior disposition coordination is completed.
       2.2.6. Transient Alert will retain control of transient aircraft and ensure proper
       disposition unless other prior coordination is completed.
