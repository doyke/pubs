     Training (COT) ensures the course of training is followed. The COT is responsible to keep
     the Director of Operations (DO) informed when resources are not available. Assigned
     personnel have varying backgrounds and different levels of experience and proficiency. The
     unit COT ensures individual training records/accomplishments are reviewed prior to entry
     into training and establishes an appropriate course of training based on the individual’s
     background and experience. In this manner, the COT ensures the unit-training program is
     tailored to fit each trainee’s needs. IQT, MQT, and CT academic and positional training
     requirements for all duty positions are contained in the respective chapter applicable to each
     unit. The lack of a dedicated Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the BCCs, or a separate
     training suite of equipment at the unit, necessitates that IQT be conducted on the operational
     mission system. As such, the training activities are integrated into the operations floor. To
     make the most effective use of positional training, IQT and MQT are fully integrated (T-2).
NOTE: The term COT is generic for the training officer and the actual term may vary from unit
to unit, e.g., Operations Training Officer (OTO). The COT for air defense C2 units shall be an
instructor ABM or “Canadian Equivalent” (T-2). Additionally for units within Air Combat
Command (ACC), the Air Defense Sector (ADS) DO is responsible for those functions assigned
to the squadron or unit commander (CC) except as noted within this instruction. See also
Paragraph 5.3 for unit guidance.

                resolved could result in personal injury, damage to equipment, or compromise
                safety of flight.
                1.2.6.6.1.2. MAJOR. Major comments are significant concerns within the
                training materials that may result in non-effective training. This category may be
                used with a general statement of concern with a subject area, intent of the
                document, etc., followed by detailed comments on specific entries in documents
                that, taken together, constitute the concern.
                1.2.6.6.1.3. SUBSTANTIVE. Substantive comments are provided because
                sections in the training materials appear to be or are potentially incorrect,
                incomplete, misleading, or confusing.
                1.2.6.6.1.4. ADMINISTRATIVE.             Administrative     comments     correct

         or supervised by an instructor.
         1.2.7.2. Ensure event objectives are briefed, debriefed, and assessed to determine
         successful accomplishments.
   1.2.8. Crew members:
         1.2.8.1. Know and complete CT requirements IAW Chapter 3 (Chapter 7 or 8 for
         Korea/Japan units) (T-3).
1.3. Training. BCC training is designed to progress crew members from IQT (Basic Course or
Requalification Training)/ MQT to CT. Upon successful completion of training (IQT/MQT),
individuals are released to Stan Eval for evaluation. A qualification is awarded IAW AFI 13-1
STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. The qualification statuses are CMR and BMC.
      1.3.1. Crew members will have received formal training in their crew position and the basic
      missions of their specific assigned/attached unit upon completion of IQT/MQT (T-3). Upon
      successful completion of the INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation, crew members will then be
      designated CMR or BMC (T-3).
         1.3.1.1. CMR. CMR crew members maintain proficiency in all core missions of the unit
         to which they are assigned. CMR entails accomplishing the minimum required training
         requirements for crew members to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary
         missions tasked for their duty position.
         1.3.1.2. BMC. BMC is a status that may be conferred on MAJCOM, NAF, and attached
         personnel whose primary duties do not allow them to maintain CMR status (i.e. lookback
         and CT requirements). BMC crew members can be used to provide additional mission
         generation/combat capability. BMC crew members must be able to attain CMR status in
         30 days or less. Designating personnel as BMC requires the unit commander’s
         (ADS/DO) approval in writing. (T-3)
             1.3.1.2.1. Commander approval is required for unsupervised mission participation by
             BMC crew members (T-3).
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                 11


        1.3.1.2.2. BMC crew members are exempt from academic training and/or special
        training programs except where specifically directed by the host unit.
  1.3.2. Attached Personnel. HQ ACC/A3CG (HQ PACAF/A8X for PACAF units)
  determines/approves attached personnel requirements for personnel assigned above NAF
  level. Attached crew members will have a valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
  Qualification IAW AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 (T-2).
  1.3.3. Unqualified (UQ).   UQ crew members fall under one or more of the following
  categories:
     1.3.3.1. Downgraded for being non-CMR/non-BMC (NCMR/NBMC) longer than 6-
     months.
     1.3.3.2. Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability.
     1.3.3.3. Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a periodic evaluation, failure to
     complete an evaluation by the expiration date, or at the Commander’s discretion
     following a Commander-directed downgrade IAW AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol. 2.
  1.3.4. Crew member Experience Level. Crew member experience levels are designed to
  indicate to unit commanders how much training crew members need to maintain CT
  requirements and therefore proficiency. All crew members are designated, by the DO as
  “Inexperienced” or “Experienced” after meeting the criteria below. The COT documents
  experience levels IAW Chapter 6.
     1.3.4.1. An experienced Air Weapons Officer, Weapons Director, Weapons Director

             performing duties in a CMR/BMC status in the corresponding qualification, of which
             a minimum of 25 must be on the unit’s assigned system of record (T-3). Due to
             shortened assignment timelines; the 621 ACS/CC may waive system of record
             minimums for Korea personnel.
      1.3.5. Upgrade/Specialized Training. Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special
      skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required of every crew
      member. Upgrade/Specialized training is normally accomplished after a crew member is
      assigned CMR/BMC status and is in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise
      specified, CMR/BMC crew members may hold special certifications/qualifications as long as
      all additional training requirements are accomplished (see Chapter 4).
         1.3.5.1. Instructor Training. Instructor crew members will maintain CMR status in their
         duty position (T-3). Instructors may perform instructor duties as long as they are CMR in
         the duty position they are instructing. Instructors who become Non-CMR (NCMR) may
         be allowed to continue academic and/or crew training device (CTD) instructor duties with
         unit Commander, (ADS/DO) approval.
             1.3.5.1.1. Instructors monitor their trainee's progress to provide guidance and
             additional instruction as required. Instructors are available to discuss problems the
             trainees may encounter and assist the trainee to ensure satisfactory progress (T-3).
             1.3.5.1.2. Throughout training, instructors provide feedback to the trainee to resolve
             problems the trainee encounters. Instructors and supervisors monitor trainee progress
             to detect marginal performance and unsafe practices, initiate corrective actions, and
             document training progress (T-3).
             1.3.5.1.3. Instructors can augment lesson plans with additional handouts to enhance
             training if necessary as long as they are consistent with and support existing
             courseware and syllabus requirements.
1.4. Training Concepts and Policies
      1.4.1. Training programs are designed to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
      consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training balances the need for realism
      against the expected threat, crew capabilities, and safety. This volume provides training
      guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in other applicable
      flying/operations publications.
      1.4.2. Training missions are designed to provide unit personnel with the skills to
      achieve/accomplish unit mission, roles/capability, maintain proficiency, as well as to enhance
      safety. Training missions emphasize combat/contingency skills through missions/scenarios
      that reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current
      intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Units train using procedures and actions applicable
      to combat/contingency scenarios (e.g. appropriate use of code words, authentication
      procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports,
      threat reactions, intelligence briefings and debriefings).
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                     13

      operations/exercises (T-2). Virtual/constructive duties can be accomplished.
          1.4.4.3.1. Virtual/constructive training accomplishments while on Duty Not
          Involving Controlling/Flying (DNIC/DNIF) status count towards CT requirements.
   1.4.5. The COT may adjust training time or remove personnel from IQT/MQT training due
   to medical disqualification or DNIC/DNIF status, emergency leave, operational
   exercises/inspections, convalescent leave, work-related TDYs, or administrative action. An

   ensure operations personnel are trained during IQT/MQT and CT IAW a MAJCOM
   approved training syllabus. Personnel assigned to units covered under this instruction have
   varying backgrounds and different levels of experience and proficiency. The COT ensures
   individuals’ training accomplishments are reviewed and an appropriate course of training is
   established based on individual background and experience. The COT records the review on
   the AF Form 4141, Individual’s Record of Duties and Experience Ground Environment
   Personnel.

   1.5.2. Crew members/individuals will accomplish the required directed CT events outlined
   in Chapter 3 (Chapter 8 for Japan) (T-3).
   1.5.3. The total number of training missions/events accomplished is the primary factor for
   maintaining an individual’s qualification status. A review of the training missions/events
   accomplished also considers specific event types.
   1.5.4. Progression from BMC to CMR requires: (T-2)
         1.5.4.1. Lookback at CMR mission/event rate.
         1.5.4.2. Qualification in all missions and any specialized mission training required for
         CMR.
         1.5.4.3. Meeting 3-month lookback requirements as described in Table 3.2 (Tables 7.1
         and 8.1 for Korea and Japan units respectively).
1.6. Training Program Development
      1.6.1. BMC/CMR control event and event operations requirements apply to all crew
      members as well as those carrying special mission certifications. The standard mission
      requirements listed in this volume establish the minimum number of control events/event
      operations per training cycle for BMC and CMR personnel.
1.7. Training Records and Reports. Units will maintain individual crew member training
records IAW AFMAN 33-363, AFI 33-360, AFI 11-401, AFI 13-1 BCC Vol. 2, Battle Control
Center Evaluation Criteria, guidance found in Chapter 6 of this volume, and appropriate
MAJCOM directives (T-3).
1.8. Crew Utilization Policy
      1.8.1. Commanders will ensure crew members are trained to fill authorized/required crew
      positions (T-3).
      1.8.2. Supervisors may assign crew members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, safety
      board member, etc.), but continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crew
      member tasking, proficiency, and experience.
      1.8.3. For inexperienced crew members, supervisors make every attempt to limit non-
      mission duties to those related to combat/unit mission training activities.
      1.8.4. Crew members will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary
      duties of training or performing the unit combat /specified mission (T-3).
1.9. Training Event Allocation Guidance
      1.9.1. Consideration is taken for priorities for event allocation for IQT/MQT and then CMR.
      In general, inexperienced crew members receive event allocation priority over experienced
      crew members.
1.10. Supplements/Waivers
      1.10.1. Supplements
         1.10.1.1. MAJCOMs will coordinate their supplement to this instruction with ACC/A3C
         before publication and forward one copy to AF/A3O-CS after publication.
         MAJCOM/A3s will approve MAJCOM supplements. Supplements will not contain
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                  15


     procedures that are contrary to this instruction. Copies of MAJCOM-level supplements,
     after approved and published, will be provided by the issuing MAJCOM to AF/A3O-CS,
     ACC/A3C, the user MAJCOM, and NGB/A3Y OPRs.
     1.10.1.2. Units will coordinate their supplement with the next higher Group, as
     applicable, prior to MAJCOM approval (T-3). MAJCOM OPRs will approve unit
     supplements. ANG units will coordinate their supplement with NGB/A3Y who in-turn
     will forward to MAJCOM OPRs for approval coordination (T-2).
        1.10.1.2.1. Supplementary guidance will not be less restrictive than the basic
        publication, but can be more restrictive (T-2).
        1.10.1.2.2. Supplemental guidance will not contradict the basic publication (T-2).
  1.10.2. Waivers
     1.10.2.1. Waiver authority for requirements of this volume will be IAW AFI-33-360,
     Publications and Forms Management. Waiver requests must come from commanders (or
     civilian directors) of the affected unit seeking relief from compliance through the
     command chain up to the appropriate tier approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or
     publications approval authority if non-tiered). See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier
     Ratings. Tier 3 waiver authorities for this AFI are as follows: (1) AFNORTH/A3 for
     Eastern Air Defense Sector and Western Air Defense Sector; (2) 611 AOC/CC for 176
     ADS; (3) 154 OG/CC for 169 ADS; (4) 607 AOC/CC for 621 ACS; (5) 35 FW/CC for

     1.10.2.2. Waiver requests may be sent via email or memorandum, and include the
     following: (T-2)
        1.10.2.2.1. Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the
        commander/director is requesting a waiver.
        1.10.2.2.2. Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the following three reasons
        IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why:
            1.10.2.2.2.1. The cost of compliance creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority
            task;
            1.10.2.2.2.2. The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit;
            1.10.2.2.2.3. Personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of
            resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).
        1.10.2.2.3. Time period or circumstance for which the waiver is required.
        1.10.2.2.4. Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander implements during
        the waiver period.
        1.10.2.2.5. Impact if waiver is disapproved.
        1.10.2.2.6. Approved waivers will be uploaded into the unit's Management Internal
        Control Toolset (MICT) for inspection activity review and publication OPR's
        situational awareness/filing (T-2).

     1.10.2.3. PACAF/A8X and NGB/A3Y will forward a copy of all approved waivers for
     their units to ACC/A3C. ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of all approved waivers
     for their units to PACAF/A8X, NGB/A3Y, and AF/A3O-CS. Units will forward all
     approved waivers and report all deviations or exceptions without waiver, through their
     chain of command, to MAJCOM OPR (T-2).
     1.10.2.4. Duration of waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested
     waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s tour length,
     whichever is shorter (T-3).
     1.10.2.5. Unless directed by the waiver authority, trainees continue to train while waiver
     requests are being staffed (T-3).
     1.10.2.6. File a copy of approved written waivers with this volume IAW AFI 33-360 (T-
     3).

                    INITIAL/MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the conduct of IQT/MQT at the operational unit level.
   2.1.1. Any individual who has been unqualified in the BCC for longer than 60 months must
   accomplish IQT/MQT. All individual crew members are required to meet IQT/MQT
   syllabus standards. (T-2)
   2.1.2. If a crew member is UQ for more than one year, the COT will determine if the crew
   member will be entered into requalification training or IQT/MQT (T-3).
2.2. Authority
   2.2.1. MAJCOM approved syllabi lay out complete requirements of IQT/MQT for each duty
   position. Course syllabi do not take precedence over the guidance in this AFI; however,
   units will conform/adhere to the grading criteria, academic/performance training standards,
   and general/specific instructions unless it specifically conflicts with this AFI (T-2).
       2.2.1.1. ACC/A3C has designated 1AF/A3T as the lead to develop BCC IQT/MQT
       syllabi and course training materials with oversight by ACC/A3CG.
          2.2.1.1.1. 1AF/A3T is responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating the
          training task lists, syllabi, gradesheets, interactive courseware, and related tests
          outlined in the BCC IQT/MQT syllabi. 1AF/A3T ensures syllabi are reviewed every
          24 months or sooner to account for weapon system changes, course critiques, or other
          data that necessitate earlier review. 1AF/A3T documents the results of the syllabus
          review and forwards a copy of the documentation to ACC/A3CG, and ACC TRSS.
          2.2.1.1.2. Course training materials include everything required to conduct the
          IQT/MQT program. The training package includes lesson plans, student guides,
          academic lessons, and ACC Form 206 Individual Mission Gradesheet (or equivalent)
          to document training results when conducting tasks, simulations, or live fly exercises.
   2.2.2. IQT/MQT is conducted by units using MAJCOM approved syllabi.
   2.2.3. Elimination Procedures. Units will follow IQT/MQT elimination procedures outlined
   in specific course syllabi and the guidance outlined in this AFI, Training Evaluation Board at
   Attachment 4 and AFI 11-401 for rated aircrew members (T-2).
2.3. Prerequisites. Prior to entering IQT/MQT, trainees must meet Air Force Education and
Training     Course    Announcements      (ETCA)       selection   prerequisites    at    site:
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ (T-2). Trainees will also meet positional prerequisites in Table
2.1. (T-3)

Note
1. Qualification in other Theater Air Control System (TACS) units (i.e. Control
and Reporting Center (CRC)/Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)
may satisfy this requirement.
2.4. Time Period to Qualify. Personnel start and complete training IAW the appropriate
syllabus/training guides (T-3).
   2.4.1. Personnel required to attend First Term Airman Center (FTAC) or other mandatory
   Professional Military Education courses enter IQT/MQT the first duty day after program or
   course completion (T-3).
   2.4.2. The DO ensures the COT enters operations personnel into IQT/MQT not later than
   (NLT) 30 calendar days after the member reports to the unit (10 days for Korea units).
   Canadian Forces personnel will be entered into IQT/MQT NLT 20 calendar days after
   reporting to operations (T-2).
      2.4.3. Commanders will report through appropriate channels to the applicable waiver
      authority individuals who are not entered into IQT/MQT within the above timeline and the
      reason for the delay (T-3).
      2.4.4. Personnel awaiting technical training course may enter IQT/MQT without a time
      limitation.
      2.4.5. Time Limitations. All trainees must complete IQT/MQT requirements within 150
      calendar days (24 UTAs (60 days for Korea units) (T-3). Failure of the trainee to complete
      IQT/MQT requirements within the above time constraints results in the COT pursuing
      actions outlined in the following decision matrix, also documented in more detail in the
      flowchart at Attachment 2. Trainees continue to train while the training extension request is
      being staffed.
         2.4.5.1. Upon reaching the 150th calendar IQT/MQT day (24 UTAs) (60 days for Korea
         units), the trainee who does not complete IQT/MQT requirements is referred to the
         Commander, (ADS/DO) who can authorize a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs) (20 days for
         Korea units) extended training period for primary qualifications. The COT may
         authorize training extensions for secondary qualifications (T-3).
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                               19


        2.4.5.1.1. The trainee’s unit commander may take actions IAW AFI 36-2101, and/or
        AFI 11-401 in lieu of extending the training period by 30 calendar days (2 UTAs) (20
        days for Korea units) (T-3).
     2.4.5.2. NLT the 180th calendar day (26 UTAs) (80th day for Korea units) of the training
     period, one of the following occurs: (T-3)
        2.4.5.2.1. The trainee completes IQT/MQT requirements and is released to Stan Eval,
        or
        2.4.5.2.2. The trainee does not complete IQT/MQT requirements and is referred to
        the Commander, (ADS DO). The Commander, (ADS/DO) may request a 30 calendar
        day (2 UTAs) (10 day for Korea units) extended IQT/MQT period from 1AF/A3T or
        PACAF/A8X who may approve or disapprove the request. The COT may authorize
        training extensions for secondary qualifications.
            2.4.5.2.2.1. The trainee’s unit commander may take action IAW AFI 36-2101
            and/or AFI 11-401 in lieu of requesting an extended training period from the
            1AF/A3T or PACAF/A8X .
            2.4.5.2.2.2. 1AF/A3T or PACAF/A8X approves a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs)
            training period extension. PACAF/A8X may delegate this authority. Disapproval
            of the extended training period request results in unit commander taking actions
            IAW AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401.
     2.4.5.3. NLT the 210th calendar day (28 UTAs) (90th day for Korea units) of the training
     period, one of the following occurs: (T-3)
        2.4.5.3.1. The trainee completes the IQT/MQT requirements, and is released to Stan
        Eval.
        2.4.5.3.2. The trainee does not complete IQT/MQT requirements and is referred to
        the unit commander (ADS/DO) who may request a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs)
        additional extended training period, through the chain of command from the
        MAJCOM OPR (ACC/A3C, PACAF/A8X as applicable). The COT may authorize

            from the MAJCOM.
            2.4.5.3.2.2. The intermediate headquarters may deny the request and choose not
            to forward to the MAJCOM, resulting in the unit commander taking actions IAW
            AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401.
            2.4.5.3.2.3. MAJCOM approves the 30-day (2 UTAs) training period extension.
                2.4.5.3.2.3.1. MAJCOM disapproval of the extended training period request
                results in the unit commander taking actions IAW AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI
                11-401.
     2.4.5.4. NLT the 240th calendar day (30 UTAs) (120th day for Korea units) of the

             2.4.5.4.1. The trainee completes IQT/MQT requirements and is released to Stan Eval.
             2.4.5.4.2. The trainee does not complete IQT/MQT requirements and is referred to
             the unit commander who takes action IAW AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401. Korea
             units may seek HHQ guidance instead of, or in addition to, administrative actions.
         2.4.5.5. (Korea units) If a trainee successfully completes IQT/MQT requirements, but
         fails INIT QUAL/MSN, the trainee enters a 30-training day additional training period.
         NLT 60 calendar days (30-days additional training plus 30-calendar day evaluation
         period) from the time of QUAL failure, one of the following occurs: (T-3)
             2.4.5.5.1. (Korea units) Trainee completes training requirements and passes the
             requalification evaluation or
             2.4.5.5.2. (Korea units) Trainee does not complete the training requirements or fails
             the re-evaluation and is referred to the 621 ACS/CC who may request a 30-calendar
             day extended remedial training period from PACAF/A8X through the 607 AOC/CC
             or take appropriate administrative action IAW AFI 36-2101.
      2.4.6. Additional Training. Additional training identified during any evaluation must be
      completed within 30 days (2 UTAs) from the date of the discrepancy. Trainees who fail to
      complete additional training will be referred to CC (ADS/DO) for administrative action. (T-
      3)
2.5. Training Documentation, Reports and Forms. Training documentation will be
completed IAW Chapter 6 (T-3).
   2.5.1. Following completion of IQT/MQT the COT records entry into CT-CMR or CT-BMC
   on AF Form 4141. The DO identifies the primary duty position of multi-qualified personnel
   on AF Form 4141.
2.6. Waivers

   equivalent in the unit’s chain of command (T-3).
   2.6.2. ACC/A3 is the waiver authority for IQT/MQT and upgrade course syllabi for all ACC
   and CONUS ANG BCC units. PACAF/A8X is delegated waiver authority for IQT/MQT and
   upgrade course syllabi for all PACAF units (to include ANG units). Units will forward
   waiver requests through channels to the appropriate MAJCOM OPR (ANG units will
   forward information copies to NGB/A3Y) (T-2). MAJCOMs will forward a copy of all
   approved waivers to AF/A3O-CS.
   2.6.3. The COT will be the approval authority for IQT/MQT proficiency advancement when
   the student demonstrates performance above syllabus standards (T-3). Proficiency
   advancement will not be used as a management tool for the purpose of graduating students or
   completing IQT/MQT by a specific date (T-3).
   2.6.4. The COT may authorize training deviations to the order of training to flex to special
   weather and/or peculiar local conditions for all student and instructor training. Deviations
   will be consistent with good training management, student progress, and student experience
   level. However all prerequisite academic training must be accomplished before associated
   positional training. Document all deviations and substitutions IAW Chapter 6. (T-3)

                                             Chapter 3

           CONUS BCC, HIRAOC, AND AKRAOC CONTINUATION TRAINING

3.1. General. This chapter outlines CT requirements to maintain BCC qualification, and to
requalify previously qualified crew members at the BCC. CT provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency at the assigned
qualification level. This chapter only applies to BCC air defense units/sectors. CT requirements
for Korea and Japan units are contained in Chapters 7 and 8, respectively.
3.2. Training Period. CT requirements are designed/planned to be completed during a
specified training cycle with specific requirements additionally defined by crew position that
must be accomplished during a 3-month sliding window lookback period (T-3). The training
cycle is a 12-month cycle beginning 1 October.
      3.2.1. Every attempt should be made to balance training across the entire training cycle.
      3.2.2. Training requirements will be based upon crew member experience level at the end of
      the training cycle or lookback period (T-3).
3.3. Prerequisites. Crew members will have CMR/BMC qualification IAW Table 2.1 (T-3).
3.4. Waivers
   3.4.1. Requests for waivers are submitted through the chain of command to the appropriate
   Tier waiver approval authority.
   3.4.2. Waiver requests will be acted on by the waiver authority within 30 days of receipt (T-
   3).
   3.4.3. CT Waiver Process. CCs forward to the waiver authority a list of crew members
   requiring CT waivers and crew members downgraded for failure to meet CT requirements.
   The waiver requests must arrive no later than 15 days after the end of their CT training cycle
   (T-3).
         3.4.3.1. After final review and determination of waiver requests, the waiver authority
         notifies subordinate units of the approval/disapproval of the waiver request. Non-
         MAJCOM level waiver authorities will forward an info copy to MAJCOM (T-2).
3.5. CONUS Training. All crews will complete applicable training and crew certification prior
to assuming operational duties (T-3). The crew certification will be documented IAW Chapter
6 (T-3).
3.6. Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators
   3.6.1. At the end of the training cycle, up to 50 percent of required positional CT training
   cycle events (rounded down to the next whole number, but not below 1) may be credited
   from instructor/evaluator monitored events. The instructor/evaluator must have monitored
   mission planning and any briefings, missions, and debriefings (T-3).
   3.6.2. Instructor/Evaluator SD/SDTs will not log control events for solely supervising
   AWOs or WDs as applicable, engaged in aircraft control (T-3). In order to log controlled
   events, SD/SDTs must meet the provisions of Paragraph 3.9.8.2. (T-3)
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                     23


3.7. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements
   3.7.1. At the end of the training cycle, the COT may prorate all positional training
   requirements when:
       3.7.1.1. An individual is TDY, medically disqualified/DNIF/DNIC, on convalescent
       leave or emergency leave for 30 cumulative days (2 UTAs) or more. Normal annual
       leave will not be considered as non-availability (T-3).
       3.7.1.2. An individual is upgraded after the start of the training cycle.
       3.7.1.3. Training accomplished during IQT/MQT will not be counted toward CT
       requirements (T-2).
   3.7.2. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit's overall CT program, as emphasis is on supporting contingency operations.
   DOs will take this into consideration during unit planning, at the end of the training cycle and
   prior to submitting training cycle waivers. Additionally, the following proration procedures
   are intended to provide DO’s flexibility in accomplishing their unit's CT program.
   3.7.3. Crew members that become CMR/BMC after the beginning of the training cycle
   accomplish a prorated share of existing training cycle academic training requirements for the
   remainder of the period beginning with the first day of the following month.
   3.7.4. All training requirement events are rounded down to the next whole number when
   prorating, however, no requirement may be prorated below one (1).
   3.7.5. Prorating of requirements will be documented IAW Chapter 6 (T-3).
3.8. CMR/BMC Regression. NCMR/NBMC crew members are not authorized to perform
crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision, except as noted in Paragraph 1.4.3.
   3.8.1. Crew members are regressed to NCMR/NBMC status for one or more of the following
   reasons: (T-3)
       3.8.1.1. Failure to meet lookback IAW Table 3.1
          3.8.1.1.1. To regain CMR/BMC status crew members will follow guidance in
          Paragraph 3.8.2.8 (T-3).
       3.8.1.2. Failure to complete training cycle CT requirements.
          3.8.1.2.1. To regain CMR/BMC status crew members will follow guidance in
          Paragraph 3.9.3.2 (T-3).
       3.8.1.3. At DO direction.
          3.8.1.3.1. To regain CMR/BMC status crew members are to complete a DO-
          approved training plan.
   3.8.2. Lookback. Lookback is a management tool used to determine and monitor CMR
   crew member proficiency during the training cycle. A crew member’s lookback
   requirements are based on the crew member’s experience status at the end of the lookback
   period. Lookback requirements are outlined in Table 3.1
       3.8.2.1. Lookback does not apply to BMC crew members.
24                                                       AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014


     3.8.2.2. DNIC/DNIF crew members’ training accomplishments in virtual/constructive
     environments will count towards lookback requirements (T-3).
     3.8.2.3. Lookback periods will be calculated on the first duty day of each month (T-3).
     3.8.2.4. The COT will submit the 3-month lookback report not later than the 5th day of
     the month (T-3).
        3.8.2.4.1. Example: SrA Jones (an inexperienced WDT) participated in two control
        events in June and one control event in July. If SrA Jones had a 3-month lookback
        requirement of eight control events, he/she would need to participate in five control
        events during the month of August in order to stay CMR.
     3.8.2.5. Lookback computations for newly qualified crew members begin following
     completion of INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation, as applicable, and 3 full months of CMR
     status. Computation for crew members being restored to CMR status will start the month
     following return to CMR status (T-3).
     3.8.2.6. If a CMR crew member fails to meet the 3-month lookback requirement, the CC
     (ADS/DO) may:
        3.8.2.6.1. Regress the individual to NCMR status or,
        3.8.2.6.2. Remove the individual from a CMR manning position; or,
        3.8.2.6.3. Place the crew member in probation status for 30 days (2 UTAs). If the
        CC, (ADS/DO) chooses probation, the crew member is required to reestablish a 3-
        month lookback by the end of the probation period to remain CMR.
            3.8.2.6.3.1. Example: SrA Jones (an inexperienced WDT) participated in one
            control event in June, two control events in July, and three control events in
            August. In this example, SrA Jones did not meet the requirement of 8 control
            events for an inexperienced WDT. With a commander approved probationary
            period, SrA Jones must complete three control events in September in order to
            remain CMR after his/her probation period expires. The completion of these
            control events would reestablish SrA Jones’s lookback and prevent him/her from
            going NCMR.
     3.8.2.7. Document all actions IAW Chapter 6. (T-3)
     3.8.2.8. Crew members that regress to NCMR status for less than 6 months (7 UTAs)
     will complete training consisting (as a minimum) of the following before returning to
     CMR status (T-3).
        3.8.2.8.1. Must be monitored by an instructor for a minimum of one effective control
        event, link event, and/or event operation, as applicable to the duty position (T-3). The
        event may be live, virtual, or constructive.
        3.8.2.8.2. Upon completion of the training and instructor recommendation,
        (documented on an ACC Form 206 or similar form) the CC (ADS/DO) returns the
        individual to CMR status (T-3).
        3.8.2.8.3. Events accomplished during the training may be credited toward a crew
        member’s CT requirements.
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                  25


       3.8.2.9. If a crew member is NCMR for more than 6 months, (7 UTAs) downgrade the
       individual to UQ status and enter into requalification training with subsequent
       requalification evaluation (T-3).

Notes
1. Any combination of controlled events may be used to attain the minimum requirements.
2. Virtual and Constructive may count as live.
3. Virtual and Constructive accomplishments by DNIC/DNIF crew members will count towards
lookback (T-3).
4. ASTs need both AST and TT event operations.
3.9. Continuation Training (CT) Requirements. The CT training cycle consists of academic
and positional training requirements. A crew member’s CT requirements are based on their
current experience status at the end of the training cycle.
   3.9.1. The DO is responsible for oversight of training crew personnel on the general
   procedures and preparation for executing the unit’s DOC-tasked mission and any applicable
   operations plans (T-3).
   3.9.2. Academic Training Requirements. The intent of the academic portion of
   CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the
   unit’s DOC-tasked missions as well as dynamic real-world environment and ever-changing
   tactics, techniques and procedures.
       3.9.2.1. The unit COT, in conjunction with Weapons and Tactics, administers and
       records the academic training that supports CT, based on the review, update, and
       expansion of existing IQT/MQT materials, as well as the introduction of any unit unique
       current operations interest/focus areas (T-3).
       3.9.2.2. The COT, with the approval of the DO, is authorized to adjust the training plan,
       throughout the training cycle, to meet a dynamic operational training environment or to
       address any negative trends.
       3.9.2.3. The COT ensures documentation of CT IAW Chapter 6 (T-2).
   3.9.3. Positional Training Requirements. The intent of the positional portion of CT is to
   keep crew members proficient in the skill sets outlined in AFI 13-1 BCC Vol. 3, Battle
   Control Center Operations.
       3.9.3.1. The COT will ensure CMR/BMC individuals meet positional training cycle
       requirements as described in Tables 3.2 – 3.8 (T-3).
          3.9.3.1.1. The COT ensures documentation of positional CT IAW Chapter 6 (T-3).
26                                                        AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014


     3.9.3.2. Failure to meet positional training requirements.
        3.9.3.2.1. Crew members who fail to accomplish positional training requirements are
        regressed to NCMR/NBMC status (T-3).
        3.9.3.2.2. The crew member will remain NCMR/NBMC until all overdue positional
        training requirements are accomplished or the crew member accomplishes
        appropriate/specific training as directed by the Commander ADS/DO (T-3).
        3.9.3.2.3. All training requirements for the previous training cycle must be completed
        before events are credited toward the next training cycle (T-3).
 3.9.4. The DO must submit a TDR to inform applicable MAJCOM through their chain of
 command when potential training shortfalls may result in individuals not meeting their
 training cycle requirements (T-2).
 3.9.5. DOs ensure virtual/constructive missions are accomplished in the most effective
 manner possible and where live missions are deficient/insufficient (T-3).
 Virtual/constructive missions/scenarios should also stress increasingly more difficult
 operations as individual crew members, and crews in general, become more proficient.
 Finally, virtual/constructive missions should stress skills or situations that are not normally
 controlled under live conditions (e.g., aircraft emergencies, multiple intercepts).
     3.9.5.1. In order to receive credit toward WD/WDT/AWO/SD/SDT for lookback and
     live training cycle control events, the control events must be accomplished IAW Tables
     3.1, 3.3, and 3.4. Additionally, these control events must be briefed/debriefed IAW AFI
     11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures. (T-3)
        3.9.5.1.1. Although units need to take advantage of all training opportunities
        available, events conducted without using live/virtual entities will be logged/counted
        toward WD/WDT/AWO/SD/SDT constructive events (T-3).
        3.9.5.1.2. Exercises may be counted towards event operation/link event CT
        requirements
 3.9.6. CT-CMR Positional TRs are expressed in terms of Event Operations, Control Events,
 Link Events, and Exercises.
     3.9.6.1. Weapons personnel TRs are expressed in terms of control events.
     3.9.6.2. Surveillance personnel TRs are expressed in terms of event operations.
     3.9.6.3. Tactical data link personnel TRs are expressed in terms of link events.
 3.9.7. MCC/T
     3.9.7.1. Event Operations. The MCC/T will receive credit for one operational event each
     time they perform MCC/T duties (mission planning, supervising the mission crew, and
     debriefing the mission) as a CMR/BMC crew member for a minimum of 2 hours (T-3).
     3.9.7.2. Exercise. The MCC/T will receive credit for one exercise event each time they
     perform MCC/T duties for a minimum of 50 percent of the exercise, or a minimum of 2
     hours if the exercise is longer than the entire duty shift (T-3).
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                    27

   3.9.8. SD/T
      3.9.8.1. Event Operation. The SD/T will receive credit for one operational event each
      time they perform SD/T duties (mission planning, supervising the WDs/AWOs engaged
      in aircraft control, and operations execution) as a CMR/BMC crew member, for a
      minimum of 2 hours (T-3).
      3.9.8.2. Controlled Event. A controlled event will be IAW Paragraph 3.9.5.1 and
      3.9.9.1 (T-3).
      3.9.8.3. Exercise. The SD/T will receive credit for one exercise event each time they
      perform SD/T duties for a minimum of 50 percent of the exercise, or a minimum of two
      hours if the exercise is longer than the entire duty shift (T-3). Exercises may be counted
      towards event operation/link event CT requirements.

1. Control events accomplished as a WD will also count towards SDT/WDT control event
requirements (T-3).
   3.9.9. AWO/WD/WDT
      3.9.9.1. Controlled Event. A controlled event will include control of any of the
      following mission types: air-to-air employment, personnel recovery (PR), air refueling
      (A/R) (T-3).
          3.9.9.1.1. A controlled event may be credited when the following criteria are met (T-
          3):
             3.9.9.1.1.1. Briefed the mission
             3.9.9.1.1.2. Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission
             3.9.9.1.1.3. Accomplished at least one of the following:
                   3.9.9.1.1.3.1. Air-to-Air. The AWO/WD provides control to at least one
                   flight of aircraft conducting air-to-air tactics against a dedicated adversary.
                   The AWO/WD will control the flight from hand-off to hand-off (T-3).
                   3.9.9.1.1.3.2. Air Refueling.    The AWO/WD provides control to an
                   aircraft/flight conducting A/R IAW AFI 11-214. The AWO/WD provides the
 28                                                          AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014


                  appropriate level of control to an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight
                  integrity is maintained) that rendezvous with a tanker/cell (or fighter
                  simulating a tanker). During A/Rs, the AWO/WD may credit one controlled
                  event per set of receivers or single receiver.
                  3.9.9.1.1.3.3. Personnel Recovery. SDs/AWOs/WDs mission plan, brief and
                  debrief the conduct of the counterland scenario including coordination with
                  external agencies.
                   3.9.9.1.1.3.3.1. Manages/positions PR participants while executing
                   preplanned or real-time PR plan to include control or coordination of PR air
                   support.
                   3.9.9.1.1.3.3.2. Manages PR airspace in the PR area, if tasked. Assigns
                   altitude blocks and establishes deconfliction plan between aircraft to include
                   manned/unmanned assets.
                   3.9.9.1.1.3.3.3. Establishes/executes the PR communications plan.
              3.9.9.1.1.4. Debriefed the controlled event.
       3.9.9.2. Swapping controllers.     During air-to-air employment or A/R missions,
       controllers may hand over the mission to another controller so that more than one
       individual may log a control event during the conduct of the mission. To log a control
       event, each AWO/WD must control fighters from fights-on/vulnerable time through
       terminate/knock-it-off using close or tactical control (T-3). For A/R mission each
       controller must meet the minimum A/R mission requirements (T-3).

Notes
1. Control events accomplished as a WD will also count towards SDT/WDT control event
requirements (T-3).
2. Constructive missions may count toward 50% of control event requirements and may be used
to bring an operator back to CMR from NCMR.
   3.9.10. ASO/T
       3.9.10.1. Event Operation. The ASO/T will receive credit for one operational event each
       time they perform ASO/T duties (supervising the surveillance section, and performing air
       picture management) as a CMR/BMC crew member for a minimum of two hours (T-3).
       Units are given the discretion of employing available surveillance opportunities to meet

                      OPERATIONS TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

6.1. Introduction. Documentation of academic and positional training accomplishments
provide a current record of an individual’s training during the past three months, the past year,
and throughout his/her career. This information is vital for an accurate assessment of the
individual’s three-month lookback, training cycle TRs, as well as overall experience level. Units
with access to the LMS will use it to document academic and positional training
accomplishments (T-2).
6.2. Operations Training Records Maintenance. Unit DOT will maintain operations training
records for all assigned/attached 13B/1C5 personnel (T-2).
6.3. Forms. This instruction prescribes and directs the use of AF Form 4141, Individual Annual
Training Record and AF Form 4142 and refers to the AF Form 8 which is prescribed by AFI 13-
1 STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. Instructions for completing these forms are contained within the
electronic form, this chapter, and Attachment 5.
   6.3.1. AF Form 4141.
       6.3.1.1. The DOT maintains an AF Form 4141 on all personnel entered into qualification
       training.
       6.3.1.2. Completed forms are maintained IAW Paragraphs 6.4.1 to 6.4.5 (T-2).
   6.3.2. AF Form 4142.
       6.3.2.1. The DOT maintains an AF Form 4142 for the following personnel:
           6.3.2.1.1. Assigned/attached personnel possessing a 13BXX/1C5X1/1C5X1D AFSC
           or Canadian equivalent who are required to maintain CMR/BMC qualification.
           6.3.2.1.2. A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each duty
           position/qualification (T-2).
       6.3.2.2. Completed AF Form 4142 is maintained IAW Paragraph 6.4.1 (T-2).
   6.3.3. AF Form 8. This form is used by Stan Eval to record evaluations; however, the COT
   uses it to certify completion of any additional training requirements that result from
   evaluations. The instructor completing the additional training (or last training event if more
   than one) will notify the COT, or designated representative if COT is not available, that
   additional training is complete (along with providing supporting mission gradesheet
   documentation) (T-3). The COT, or designated representative, will sign and date the “Date
   Additional Training Completed” block in Section II of the AF Form 8 (T-3).
       6.3.3.1. The COT annotates completion of the evaluation on the AF Form 4141 (T-3).
6.4. Permanent Training Record. The COT maintains a permanent training record for all
assigned and attached personnel. The COT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each
folder by typing the individual’s last name, first name, and middle initial in capital letters on a
standard size folder label. This label is affixed to the folder’s tab. The training officer may
pencil in additional information on the label (e.g., rank, crew, director designator). Tests or test
answer sheets are not filed in this folder. Current AF Form 4141/4142 may be kept in a separate
 36                                                           AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014


binder for ease of record keeping, but forms will be returned to the permanent training records
prior to the individual’s permanent change of station (T-3). Permanent training records may also
be maintained electronically in lieu of hard copies. If maintained electronically, the format will
be identical to the six-part folder and a backup system for recovering the "digital" records due to
system failure must be in-place (T-3). The unit must ensure continuous accessibility of the
digital records. (T-3)
NOTE: The COT will ensure all items are recorded within the LMS (T-3). AF Form 1042 will
be placed in a separate folder, either electronically or hard copy IAW Paragraph 6.4.3 (T-3).
The permanent training record, to include electronic is organized as follows:
      6.4.1. Section I, Qualification Data. This section contains the current copy of AF Form 4141
      and AF Form 4142. If hard copies are maintained for AF Form 4141 entries, place the AF
      Form 4141 on the left side and AF Form 4142 on the right side of Section I. Units with the
      LMS may maintain the AF Form 4141 and the current AF Form 4142 electronically in the
      LMS however the information in both areas must match (T-3).
      6.4.2. Section II, Personal History.         This section contains any other current
      records/documents pertaining to qualification or proficiency, to include waivers (T-2).
      6.4.3. Section III, Medical Qualification/Medical Waivers. This section includes a current
      copy of the original annual AF Form 1042 for all 13B/1C5 personnel or Canadian
      equivalents. An AF Form 1042 placing an individual on DNIC status is also kept during the
      DNIC period. When applicable, the AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training
      Record, is placed behind the current AF Form 1042. In addition, medical profiles that affect
      operational status will be filed in this section (T-3). Sensitive medical history or other
      records of a personal medical nature will not be maintained in this file (T-0). If medical
      documentation is sensitive, a memo for record, signed by the DO, is placed in this section.
      This memo states the individual is removed from training and includes dates, if available.
      After an individual is placed on DNIC/DNIF status, the COT will ensure the AF Form 1042,
      is maintained during the DNIC/DNIF period (7 days or more), file it in the transitory files
      and annotate the AF Form 4141 (T-3).
      6.4.4. Section IV, Training History. This section includes certificates from AETC courses,
      MAJCOM formal courses, and any formal ground environment training. This material is
      filed chronologically with the latest date on top and kept as a permanent part of this folder.
      Locally generated training records may be maintained in this section while the individual is
      in IQT/MQT training. Also contained is the DO’s justification for late entry into IQT/MQT.
      System specific task/task qualification, or the computer-generated product, is maintained in
      this section or in a database. However, upon PCS, all computerized products must be
      translated into hardcopy or electronic means and placed in the appropriate section (T-3).
      6.4.5. Section V, Miscellaneous Experience. This section contains completed AF Form
      4141/4142 and control experience forms from other commands. File these forms
      chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder (T-3).
6.5. Transfer of Records. Upon reassignment (PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA)
only), a student will hand carry the permanent records to the gaining unit (T-3). If the gaining
unit has access to the LMS then the losing unit will notify the LMS Analysis and Resource
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                   37


Center (ARC) Help Desk to coordinate transferring the individual to the gaining unit’s domain
(T-3).
   6.5.1. Where available, the information required by AF Form 4141/4142 will be maintained
   within the LMS (instead of hardcopy) (T-3). If the LMS version is used, upon PCS/TDY, the
   losing unit will contact the LMS ARC Help Desk and request the individual’s record be
   placed in a hold status (T-3). COT may print a hard copy or provide electronic “pdf” of the
   AF Form 4141 and all AF Form 4142s to be hand carried with the individual. Upon in-
   processing operations training, the gaining unit’s COT will contact the LMS ARC Help Desk
   to have the individual’s record transferred into their unit’s domain (T-3).
6.6. Documentation. Training is documented on two forms: AF Form 4141 and AF Form 4142.
The LMS will be used as the primary system of documentation for those units that access the
LMS (T-2).
   6.6.1. AF Form 4141. This form is used to record significant occurrences during an
   individual’s training. As a minimum the following events must be recorded (T-3):
       6.6.1.1. The COT will review all newly arriving individuals’ training records and ensure
       the review is recorded in the LMS (T-3). The COT will use these instructions in
       conjunction with the ACC/A3CG provided training documentation table for completing
       the AF Form 4141 within the LMS (T-2).
       6.6.1.2. When an individual has completed a transfer of training status from another unit,
       the COT will enter completion date and test scores (T-3).
       6.6.1.3. The COT will annotate any removal from unit training for purposes of formal
       school attendance (T-3).
       6.6.1.4. The COT will certify that a trainee has completed IQT/MQT (T-3).
       6.6.1.5. The COT will record entry into CT-CMR or CT-BMC (T-3).
       6.6.1.6. The DO will identify the primary duty position of multi-qualified personnel (T-
       3).
       6.6.1.7. The COT will document the appointment of an individual as an instructor by
       duty position (T-3).
       6.6.1.8. The COT will document regression to NCMR/NBMC status and return to
       CMR/BMC status (T-3).
       6.6.1.9. When the CC (ADS/DO) grants a probationary period for an individual to meet
       3-month lookback requirements (T-3).
       6.6.1.10. Proration of requirements will be recorded and certified by the DO (T-3).
       6.6.1.11. The COT will document specialized training/task certification (e.g. Emergency
       Action Coordinator) (T-3).
   6.6.2. AF Form 4142. This form is used to document training accomplishments. The COT
   records accomplishment of academic and positional TRs and instructor or Stan Eval-
   monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142. (T-2)

6.7. Training Deficiency Reports (TDR). Training Deficiency Reports are used to identify
problems beyond the unit’s ability to resolve and that may prevent the unit, or individual(s) from
satisfying academic or positional TRs. TDRs identify known or potential training problems to
Higher Headquarters for information and management purposes. TDR identified issues need to
be resolved at the lowest level of command.
   6.7.1. As a minimum, the unit submits the following information: (T-2)
       6.7.1.1. Broken equipment that has an impact on training (to include simulation
       equipment)
       6.7.1.2. Lack of live and virtual events for training or evaluations
       6.7.1.3. Instructor/evaluator shortfalls
       6.7.1.4. Airspace limitations
       6.7.1.5. Inability to conduct effective exercises
       6.7.1.6. Mode 4 training shortfalls
       6.7.1.7. Computer operations to include hardware and software problems
   6.7.2. Units submit TDRs through their chain of command (info copy only to appropriate
   NAF) via electronic means in electronic memorandum format noted in AFMAN 33-326.
   Units will use the following format and provide sufficient detail that will lead to specific
   action to resolve the issue: (T-2)
       6.7.2.1. Title: Training Deficiency Report
       6.7.2.2. Unit: Unit submitting the training deficiencies
       6.7.2.3. Description of problem
       6.7.2.4. Date problem began/expected to begin
       6.7.2.5. Corrective action taken/anticipated
       6.7.2.6. Estimated date of problem correction
       6.7.2.7. Recommended solution to resolve the training deficiency
       6.7.2.8. Remarks
   6.7.3. MAJCOMs will respond to these reports within 10 work days of receipt, and if
   appropriate, respond with specific guidance or a plan to resolve the identified issues with
   estimated completion dates.
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                  39


                                          Chapter 7

                     KOREAN TACTICAL AIR CONTROL SYSTEM

7.1. General. This chapter outlines CT requirements for personnel assigned to the 621 ACS.
CT provides crew members with the volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to
maintain proficiency at the assigned qualification level. All 13B and 1C5 personnel are required
to attain CMR status in an authorized duty position, unless otherwise stated (T-2).
7.2. Waivers. Requests for waivers are submitted through the chain of command to the
appropriate Tier waiver approval authority (T-2).
7.3. Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators. At the end of the lookback
period, up to 50 percent of required positional CT events (rounded down to the next whole
number, but not below 1) may be credited from instructor/evaluator monitored events. The
instructor/evaluator must have monitored mission planning and any briefings, missions, and
debriefings (T-3).
7.4. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements
   7.4.1. At the end of the lookback period, the COT may prorate all positional training
   requirements when:
       7.4.1.1. An individual is TDY, medically disqualified/DNIF/DNIC, convalescent leave
       or on emergency leave for 30 cumulative days or more. Normal annual leave will not be
       considered as non-availability (T-3).
       7.4.1.2. An individual is upgraded after the start of the lookback period. Training
       accomplished during IQT/MQT will not be counted toward CT requirements (T-3).
7.5. Continuation Training (CT) Requirements. The COT documents on the AF Form 4141
that the trainee has completed training requirements and is CMR (T-3). CT requirements consist
of both academic and positional minimums identified below.
   7.5.1. Academic Training Requirements. The intent of the academic portion of
   CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the
   unit’s DOC-tasked missions as well as dynamic real-world environment and ever-changing
   tactics, techniques and procedures.
       7.5.1.1. The unit COT, in conjunction with Weapons and Tactics, administers and
       records the academic training that supports CT based on the review, update, and
       expansion of existing IQT/MQT materials, as well as the introduction of any unit unique
       current operations interest/focus areas (T-2).
       7.5.1.2. As a minimum, academic CT requirements consist of 15 hours of training
       semiannually (T-3).
       7.5.1.3. Academic CT requirements may be prorated based upon the month in which the
       individual was upgraded to CMR (beginning the first full month following upgrade to
       CMR) (T-2).
       7.5.1.4. The COT ensures documentation of CT IAW Chapter 6 (T-2).

   7.5.2. Positional Requirements. Personnel will complete the required number of events
   contained in Table 7.1 (T-3). Due to annual rotation cycle associated with remote
   assignments, lookback requirements will be used in lieu of annual requirements (T-3).

Table 7.1. Korea Quarterly Live Weapons Positional/3-month Lookback Requirements.

Notes:
1. Constructive A/R can be substituted for 100% of live requirements.
2. Air-to-air missions must be a minimum of 2vX events or greater (T-3).
3. When live air-to-air and air-to-surface missions are not available to meet TRs, the DO may
authorize an individual to substitute 50% of live requirements with constructive.
4. Instructor/evaluators can credit up to 50% of total training requirements from monitored
missions on a one-to-one basis.
5. Event operations equate to positional hours.
       7.5.2.1. Events accumulated during a TDY status, to include contingency operations,
       may be logged as CT events and may count toward lookback events with the following
       exception:
           7.5.2.1.1. A crew member’s primary system lookback events will never be less than
           50 percent of total requirements (T-3).
       7.5.2.2. DNIC/DNIF crew member’s training accomplishments on virtual/constructive
       environments will count towards lookback requirements (T-3).
       7.5.2.3. Training requirements will be based upon crew member experience level at the
       end of the 3-month lookback period (T-3).
       7.5.2.4. Lookback periods will be calculated on the first duty day of each month (T-3).
       7.5.2.5. The COT will submit the 3-month lookback report no later than the 5th day of the
       month (T-3).
       7.5.2.6. Lookback computations for newly qualified crew members begins following
       completion of INIT QUAL/MSN Eval, as applicable, and 3 full months of CMR status.
       Computation for crew members being restored to CMR status will start the month
       following return to CMR status (T-3).
Example: Capt Garza completed his/her INIT QUAL/MSN on 17 October. His/her lookback
computations will not begin until 1 November. Even though Capt Garza’s lookback does not
start until 1 November, any CT accomplishments accumulated from 17 - 31 October are counted
toward lookback requirements.
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                   41


   7.5.3. Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback. If a CMR crew member fails to meet the 3-
   month lookback requirement, the DO may:
      7.5.3.1. Regress the individual to NCMR status or,
      7.5.3.2. Remove the individual from a CMR manning position; or,
      7.5.3.3. Place the crew member in probation status for 1 month. If the DO chooses
      probation, the crew member is required to reestablish a 3-month lookback by the end of
      the probation period to remain CMR.
      7.5.3.4. Document all actions IAW Chapter 6 (T-2).
   7.5.4. Crew members that regress to NCMR status for less than 6 months will complete DO-
   approved training consisting (as a minimum) of the following before returning to CMR status
   (T-3):
      7.5.4.1. Must be monitored by an instructor for a minimum of one effective control event
      and/or event operation, as applicable to the duty position (T-3). The event will be
      completed on live mission events (T-3).
      7.5.4.2. Upon completion of training, the instructor recommends return to CMR,
      (documented on an ACC Form 206 or similar form) and the COT returns the individual
      to CMR status (T-3).
      7.5.4.3. The missions and events accomplished during the training may be credited
      toward a crew member’s 3-month lookback.
   7.5.5. If a crew member is NCMR for more than 6 months, the COT will downgrade the
   crew member to UQ status and they will enter into requalification training with subsequent
   requalification evaluation (T-3).
   7.5.6. If a crew member is UQ for more than one year, the COT will determine if the crew
   member will be entered into requalification training or IQT/MQT (T-3).
7.6. Unqualified (UQ)
   7.6.1. The DO will direct the downgrade of a CMR/BMC qualified individual to UQ status
   when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to complete a QUAL MSN by the
   expiration date, fails to regain CMR status within 6 months, or the DO determines an
   individual to be non-proficient (T-3). When an individual is downgraded to UQ, one of the
   following will occur (T-3):
      7.6.1.1. The DO directs trainee entry into requalification training for 30 calendar days as
      required or
      7.6.1.2. Unit CC takes appropriate administrative action IAW AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI
      11-401.
      7.6.1.3. Upon successful completion of the requalification training, the COT releases the
      individual to Stan Eval to complete the requalification evaluation (RQ) within 30 days.
   7.6.2. NLT the 30th calendar day, of the requalification training period one of the following
   occurs: (T-3)
 42                                                         AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014


         7.6.2.1. The trainee completes the requalification training, and is released to Stan Eval
         by the COT or
         7.6.2.2. The trainee does not complete the requalification training.      The trainee is
         referred to the unit DO to do one of the following:
            7.6.2.2.1. The trainee is referred to the unit CC to take administrative action IAW
            AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401 or
            7.6.2.2.2. Request an additional 30 calendar days of extended requalification training
            through the appropriate NAF to PACAF/A8X. The trainee will immediately enter the
            30 calendar day extension while the request is being staffed (T-3). These days will
            count towards the 30 days of extended requalification training (T-3).
            7.6.2.2.3. If the NAF or PACAF/A8X denies the request then the unit CC takes
            action IAW AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401. The MAJCOM is the final approval for
            the additional 30 calendar days of requalification training.
7.7. Unit Certification Program. Unit-unique positions (non-CMR required positions) will be
given a certified status (T-3). When applicable, each unit will develop and implement a training
program for all unit certified positions IAW MAJCOM/NAF/Group/unit directives and
document the certification IAW Chapter 6 (T-3).
7.8. Multi-Qualified Personnel. DOs may multi-qualify personnel who demonstrate the
knowledge and proficiency skills required to maintain multiple BCC duty position qualifications.
The purpose of multiple qualifications is to provide unit DOs with flexibility to address a
dynamic training environment and to increase combat capability.
      7.8.1. Personnel who are selected to train in another position must complete IQT/MQT
      requirements IAW Chapter 2 (T-3).
      7.8.2. Multi-qualified CMR/BMC personnel must achieve the performance standards and
      academic TRs for each position, however, when the academic requirements are identical,
      they need only be accomplished once (T-3).
      7.8.3. Upon completing an INIT QUAL MSN for a secondary qualification, complete
      documentation IAW Chapter 6. Additionally, ensure the documentation reflects both a
      primary duty position and all other qualifications as secondary duty positions. (T-2)
         7.8.3.1. A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each duty position an
         individual is qualified in (T-2).
7.9. Augmenting Personnel. The 621 ACS is required to develop/implement a training
program for augmenting personnel (AWO/WD or Joint service equivalent) IAW unit directives.
The DO will ensure augmenting personnel are CMR (or service equivalent) in their home station
primary weapon system. Based on the unit approved training program, augmenting personnel
will be monitored by an instructor until certified. Upon completion of certification, augmenting
personnel will be allowed to perform crew specific duties. (T-3)
7.10. Event Operations/Positional Hours
      7.10.1. MCC/T/DST
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                       43


     7.10.1.1. Event Operations/Positional Hours. The MCC/T/DST will receive credit for
     one operational event each time they perform MCC/T/DST duties (mission planning,
     supervising the mission crew, and debriefing the mission) as a CMR/BMC crew member
     for an entire crew shift (T-3).
  7.10.2. SD
     7.10.2.1. Event Operations/Positional Hours. The SD will receive credit for one
     operational event each time they perform SD duties (mission planning, supervising the
     WDs/AWOs engaged in aircraft control, and operations execution) as a CMR/BMC crew
     member, for an entire crew shift (T-3).
     7.10.2.2. Controlled Event. A controlled event will be IAW Paragraph 7.10.3.1 (T-3).
  7.10.3. AWO/WD
     7.10.3.1. Controlled Event. A controlled event will include control of any of the
     following mission types: air-to-air, PR, A/R and air-to-ground (A/G) (T-3).
     7.10.3.2. A controlled event may be credited when the following criteria are met: (T-3)
        7.10.3.2.1. Briefed the mission.
        7.10.3.2.2. Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission.
        7.10.3.2.3. Accomplished at least one of the following:
            7.10.3.2.3.1. Air-to-Air. The AWO/WD provides control to at least one flight of
            aircraft conducting air-to-air tactics against a dedicated adversary.      The
            AWO/WD will control the flight from hand-off to hand-off (T-3).
            7.10.3.2.3.2. Air Refueling. The AWO/WD provides control to an aircraft/flight
            conducting A/R IAW AFI 11-214. The AWO/WD provides close or tactical
            control to an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight integrity is maintained) that
            rendezvous with a tanker/cell. During A/Rs, the AWO/WD may credit one A/R
            mission per set of receivers or single receiver. Weapons personnel may also
            credit more than one type mission during combined missions, in cases where the
            flight conducts another mission in addition to the refueling. For example, if the
            AWO/WD conducts a rendezvous onto a tanker then takes the fighters off tanker
            and conducts intercepts, the weapons individual credits both an A/R and an air-to-
            air mission. The A/R missions must be conducted in a live, virtual, constructive
            environment (T-3).
            7.10.3.2.3.3. Debriefed the controlled event
     7.10.3.3. Swapping controllers: During air-to-air employment or A/R missions,
     controllers may hand over the mission to another controller so that more than one
     individual may log a control event during the conduct of the mission. To log a control
     event, each AWO/WD must control fighters from fights-on/vulnerable time through
     terminate/knock-it-off using close or tactical control. For A/R mission each controller
     must meet the minimum A/R mission requirements. (T-3)

ground command and control units. It provides a myriad of training management reports on
individual training accomplishments and is accessible via the internet to all users.
Mission—Department of Defense definition: The task, together with the purpose, that clearly
indicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore. In common usage, especially when
applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task. For the purpose
of this AFI, a more detailed explanation of this term applies: A mission includes briefing,
controlling and debriefing. Briefings include training objectives. Controlling consists of taking
radio and radar control of aircraft and accomplishing one or more types of mission, such as air-
to-air, air refueling, air-to-surface, and active air defense scrambles. Debriefing with the pilots
(and instructor where applicable). The brief/debrief may be accomplished via telephone/radio;

proficient when they can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and
safety.
Prorating—A process used to determine a crew member’s training requirement proportionately
based on approved consideration to include TDY (including contingency operations), medical
disqualified/DNIC, or emergency leave status for more than 30 cumulative days.
Qualification—A status assigned to a crew member after completion of specific positional
training and the accomplishment of an evaluation resulting in the generation of AF Form 8
documentation.
Requalification Training—Training for crew members who are designated UQ who 1) fail any

                  REMOVAL OF CREW MEMBERS FROM TRAINING

TRAINING EVALUATION BOARD (TEB) PROCESS/PROCEDURES
A4.1. General. The purpose of this attachment is to establish/outline specific procedures to be
taken when non-rated personnel fail to make satisfactory progress in initial qualification, mission
qualification, or continuation training. Procedures to remove a rated officer from training and/or
flying related duties/operations are outlined in AFI 11-402, Chapter 4, Flying Evaluation Boards.
This attachment only applies to non-rated personnel (officer and enlisted) assigned to an ADS.
The rights of non-rated personnel are contained in this attachment. A TEB is not required for
individuals in training for secondary or beyond qualifications.
A4.2. Policy. Per AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, Air Force policy is to retain and
retrain only those Airmen who have demonstrated the ability to successfully complete training
and whose past record clearly justifies further training. IAW training syllabi elimination
procedures, utilization of the administrative actions outlined in this attachment are based upon
failure of an individual to attain a duty qualification, failure to re-qualify, or to maintain
proficiency levels outlined in this instruction. These procedures are not meant to replace or be
used in place of punitive disciplinary action and are not a substitute for action under the UCMJ,
state military law, or other administrative directives.
A4.3. Explanation of terms.
   A4.3.1. Training Evaluation Board. An administrative, fact-finding proceeding designed to
   ensure the quality control of the ADS non-rated officer and enlisted force. Board members
   examine an individual’s professional qualification for BCC-related duties and
   evaluate/determine potential for use in future operations.
   A4.3.2. Flying Evaluation Board (FEB). An administrative, fact-finding proceeding
   designed to ensure the quality control of the rated force. Board members examine an aircrew
   member’s professional qualification for aviation related service, evaluate potential for use in
   future aviation duties, and make recommendations to higher authorities. A FEB may be
   established for a rated officer due to lack of proficiency, lack of judgment in the performance
   of duties, failure to attain/maintain qualification or meet training requirements, or when a
   rated officer exhibits questionable professional qualities or committed an intentional
   violation of aviation instructions or procedures. Do not confuse this rated force tool with the
   TEB outlined in this attachment.
   A4.3.3. Rated Aircrew Member. A rated aircrew member is a commissioned officer who
   holds a USAF aeronautical rating. The USAF considers rated officers to be in career aviation
   status and awards ratings only to pilots, navigators, ABMs, and flight surgeons.
A4.4. TEB Convening Authority. The organization at the 1 AF/A3T (PACAF/A8X) level or
above, with the authority to direct a unit commander to establish a TEB.                 The
commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit conducting the
respondent’s training has convening authority/jurisdiction for establishment of the TEB. The
convening authority for ACC units is the 1 AF/A3T. The convening authority for PACAF units
is PACAF/A8X. The commander initiates the TEB process by forwarding a TEB request to the
convening authority for review/action. Notify NGB/A3Y for ANG personnel.
AFI13-1BCCV1 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                    57


   A4.4.1. Appeal Authority. The appeal authority for the TEB process outlined in this
   attachment is the convening authority. In cases in which the unit commander is the
   convening authority, the appeal authority is the commander/organization having a command
   relationship with the unit conducting the member’s training.
   A4.4.2. Cause. Failure of a crew member to attain or maintain qualification in a crew
   position and/or failure to meet required standards when enrolled in an upgrade course.
   A4.4.3. Respondent. A crew member whose performance does not meet established
   standards and for whom the TEB action has been requested or is being considered.
   A4.4.4. Evidence. The information/facts presented to the TEB. This information may
   include anything related to the individual’s training, performance, or past evaluations. The
   material gathered by the respondent's organization as evidence will contain a total profile of
   the individual (T-2). Material may be collected from any source including past assignments.
   The student/crew member facing possible commander action will be given the opportunity to
   address the board to provide personal insight into their training deficiencies (T-2).
   A4.4.5. Board Administrator. A designated unit member who ensures the TEB is
   established, conducted, and documented IAW this attachment. The Board Chair determines
   additional administrator responsibilities and cessation of TEB related duties.
   A4.4.6. Board Recorder. An officer or NCO who is charged with the administrative details
   of the board to include publishing of minutes. Board recorder duties include: acquiring any
   necessary materials (tape recorder, steno pads, pencils, etc.), preparing the TEB location, and
   most importantly capturing minutes of the board proceedings within two duty days of the
   TEB (TEB board chair has authority for reasonable delay).
   A4.4.7. Board Composition. The TEB will normally be comprised of the unit commander,
   DO, and Chief of Training but may include other members as determined by the board
   chairperson (T-3). The unit operations superintendent will be a board member for enlisted
   personnel TEBs (T-3). A board administrator and recorder will be appointed by the unit DO
   (T-3).
A4.5. TEB Procedures. The Chief of Training will ensure the TEB is established, conducted,
and documented IAW this attachment. Upon approval from the convening authority, apply the
following guidelines: (T-2)
   A4.5.1. The squadron commander initiates the TEB process by forwarding a TEB request to
   the convening authority for review/action.
   A4.5.2. Upon approval from the convening authority, the commander establishing the TEB
   will (T-2):

1. Entries are in chronological order. Dates/duration indicate when the events occurred, not the
date of posting. Backlogs are to be kept to a minimum.

2. Entries must match the sample (T-3). Additional operational training entries can be posted to
record significant events for which there is no sample. Do not enter events that are not
operationally related (e.g. weapons/vehicle qualification, ancillary training).

3. Columns C, D, E and F reflect when the written and positional evaluations were performed.

4. The individual currently holding the cited position when the event occurred is the only one
who is authorized to sign for the event. A signature block is required for hard copy records. For
those units using the LMS, annotate the authorizing official in the comments field. If the form
must be re-accomplished and the authorizing officials have departed the unit, enter the signature
block and type or print “Signature Not Available” above the signature block (T-3).

5. No signature is required however, the appropriate name of the individual must be typed in (T-
3).

6. Only required for TDYs in excess of 7 calendar days.

7. Spot evaluations that do not affect the training status of the individual are not required.

8. 621 ACS will use “CRC” in place of “BCC” for all AF Form 4141/4142 LMS entries (T-2).
