       GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS

1.1. Nominating Procedures. Commanders at all levels actively advertise the nomination procedures
for trophies and awards. Commanders verify achievements and nominate those qualified for appropriate
awards. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders, vice commanders, or executive directors indorse nom-
inations on their personnel. When nominating persons or units assigned to other commands, commanders
acquire by letter, the coordination of the commander or vice commander of the owning MAJCOM, FOA,
or DRU. Submit nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS, with the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU com-
mander's coordination.
1.1. (AMC) Nominating Procedures. Commanders should consider the achievements/services of an
individual or unit submitted for a military decoration or award under the provisions of AFI 36-2803, The
Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, for the special trophies and awards outlined in AFI
36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards. Take maximum advantage of the overall Air Force awards pro-
gram by reviewing decoration recommendations, history reports, etc., for possible nominees for special
trophies and awards. Recognition of AMC people who receive awards is a vital part of the honors pro-
gram. Ensure recipients are afforded an opportunity to complete a hometown news release form and/or be
recognized by coverage in the base newspaper. The base Public Affairs office can assist in this effort.

1.2. Air Force-level Awards. Air Force functional activities or private organizations establish Air
Force-level awards. The designated OPR and HQ USAF/DPXPQ approve implementing instructions.
Notify HQ USAF/DPXPQ when the award is terminated.
    1.2.1. The experts in a given function will manage functional awards. Functional managers will
    ensure nomination write-ups are limited to two pages, using the Air Force Form 1206, Nomination
    for Award. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by HQ USAF/DPX. Functional areas
    requiring the use of base visits to determine award winners will limit such visits to one visit per base
    per award.

1.3. Wartime Guidance. Programs governed by this instruction will continue during conflicts below
the level of declared war. In the event of a national emergency declared by Congress or the President of
the United States, programs sponsored by Headquarters (HQ) USAF may be suspended. The Air Force
will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored by private organizations.
1.3. (AMC) Wartime Guidance. HQ AMC will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored
by private organizations.

1.4. Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. Commanders at any level may establish
special trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and units or organiza-
tions. Include such recognition programs in appropriate base supplements.
1.4. (AMC) Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. AMC guidance and processing
procedures will be established by the functional manager for special trophies and awards as contained in
the AMC Special Trophies and Awards Guide which can be located on the HQ AMC/A1 Web page at
https://private.amc.af.mil/a1/template.cfm.
AFI36-2805_AMC_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       5


  1.4.1. Awards may be named in honor of living or deceased Air Force military members and Depart-
  ment of the Air Force (DAF) civilians who had honorable records and made significant contributions
  to the Air Force or to the functional area in which the award is being established. Consider individu-
  als of prominence or those whose careers or actions were important and meaningful to the function in
  which the award will be established. Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the indi-
  vidual to ensure the individual is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When
  establishing an award, the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the appro-
  priate commander or vice commander, to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS notifying of the establishment of the
  award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or instruction. Process all supple-
  ments and instructions in accordance with AFI 37-160V1, The Air Force Publications and Forms
  Management Programs – Developing and Processing Publications. Commanders at all levels are
  responsible for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of special trophies and awards programs. All
  awards named for individuals will be established only in accordance with this instruction. The
  requirements of this instruction are mandatory when considering memorial-type awards. List what
  sources were reviewed to perform the background check and that verification has been made that no
  derogatory information was found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their
  honor.
  1.4.2. Possible sources to review when determining individuals' suitability for memorialization are:
     1.4.2.1. Military personnel records (retired or deceased military members), which are located at
     the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), Air Force Reference Branch, 9700 Page Boule-
     vard, St. Louis MO 63132-5100.
     1.4.2.2. Civilian personnel records (retired or deceased DAF civilians), which are located at the
     National Archives and Records Administration, NPRC (Civilian Personnel Records), 111 Win-
     nebago Street, St. Louis MO 63118.
     1.4.2.3. Public libraries for archived newspaper articles.
     1.4.2.4. Local newspapers.
     1.4.2.5. Local courthouse records.

     1.4.2.7. Interview family, friends, acquaintances, and coworkers.
  1.4.3. Do not duplicate existing trophies and awards programs in either name or criteria. (Recogniz-
  ing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports or a citation to accompany an award is
  not considered duplication or dual recognition.) Award elements will not duplicate elements of exist-
  ing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601, volume 1, USAF Budget Guidance and Proce-
  dures, for further guidance regarding funding for award elements. Awards must be of nominal value.
  Awards may not be redeemable for cash, merchandise, or services. The cost of awards will be com-
  mensurate with the significance of the achievement being recognized.
  1.4.3. (AMC) Major General Robert Olds Award. This award, sponsored by AMC, is presented
  annually during graduation week to the most outstanding USAF Academy (USAFA) graduating cadet
  in the International Affairs field. The award, an eagle and fledglings sculpture procured with AMC
  appropriated funds, is administered by the USAFA Cadet Awards Council.

    1.4.4. A one-time unique trophy or award may be given to an individual or unit whose achievements
    make a significant contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air Force.
    1.4.5. (Added-AMC) On-the-Spot Recognition and Appreciation Coins. Appropriated funds may be
    used for on-the-spot recognition and appreciation coins. The use of these coins is authorized for com-
    manders not lower than squadron-level and two-digit directorates at the headquarters level. Coins,
    except for the HQ AMC commander’s coin, will not be personalized. Use only the organization’s
    name and the position of the presenter. These coins will provide personal recognition and appreciation
    to military and appropriated fund civilian personnel who, by their dedicated individual efforts, have
    facilitated the successful accomplishment of a particular AMC program, function, or mission. These
    coins provide senior leadership with an informal means to show special recognition of, and apprecia-
    tion for, a job well done.
       1.4.5.1. (Added-AMC) Coins purchased with appropriated funds may not be presented to anyone
       as a gift, memento, or souvenir.
       1.4.5.2. (Added-AMC) Coins awarded to civilian employees must be annotated in the
       employee’s personnel folder.
       1.4.5.3. (Added-AMC) The directorate/organization with a stock of coins purchased with appro-
       priated funds should implement an internal tracking mechanism to ensure such coins are responsi-
       bly managed.
       1.4.5.4. (Added-AMC) Coins for contractor personnel are not authorized under any type of fund-
       ing.

1.5. Travel for Military Members or Department of the Air Force Civilians. Air Force military or

to the same career field. The AFA honors the five members and their spouses (if applicable) at a cere-
mony each May in Washington DC. The period of the award is 1 January - 31 December. HQ AFPC/
DPPPRS solicits nominations from the appropriate Air Force functional manager for that career field and

AFI36-2805_AMC_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     13


HQ AFPC/DPPP sends a message outlining nomination procedures to the MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs
each year. Send nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS by 30 April.
3.4. (AMC) 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY) Program. For the AMC program, each
wing (including the CRWs), Stand-Alone Groups (19 ARG, 317 AG, and 463 AG), the 15 and 21 EMTFs
(enroutes and staff), the 18 AF staff*, the AMWC, and HQ AMC (which includes/competes the A Staff*
and all Special Staff Elements*) may submit one Amn, one NCO, one SNCO, and one First Sergeant per
category. Notes: Under the A Staff, the Mobility Air Forces Logistics Support Center (MAFLSC) com-
petes through the A4. The 805th and 868th Communications Squadrons (CS) compete through the A6.
The Air Intelligence Squadron (AIS) competes through the A2. The TACC and 15th Operational Weather
Squadron (OWS) compete through the 18 AF staff. Additionally, Special Staff Elements are identified as
CCX/DS, CCC, CCP, HO, HC, PA, TE, RE, JA, SG, and IG (w/SE). Note: Guidance and processing pro-
cedures for AMC’s 12 OAY and 1st Sergeant programs are located on the HQ AMC/A1 Web page at
https://private.amc.af.mil/a1/template.cfm.
   3.4.1. There are three categories of competition: Airman (airman through senior airman); NCO (ser-
   geant and technical sergeant); and Senior NCO (master sergeant through chief master sergeant).
   3.4.1. (AMC) From this pool of nominees, a “records only” selection board chaired by the AMC/
   CCC, will convene to select the top three per category. Those final 12, along with their spouses, will
   be invited to Scott AFB to meet the command “personal appearance” board and partake in briefings,
   tours, and an awards banquet. Ensuring nominees are available for the “personal appearance” board
   and awards week is critical!
   3.4.2. Base nominations only on achievements that occurred during the current calendar year. For
   example, the nominees' achievements for the 1998 program should cite achievements occurring from
   1 January 1997 through 31 December 1997. Since nominees are representatives of the Air Force
   enlisted force, they must also stand the test of a "whole life/whole career" scrutiny, although the
   observation period for the award is 1 year.
   3.4.3. All nominees must sign a statement of intent agreeing if selected as a MAJCOM, FOA, or
   DRU nominee, they will obtain the required retainability in order to compete at Air Force level. All
   nominees who meet the Air Force selection board must have sufficient retainability so that, if selected
   as a 12 OAY, they can serve on the AFA Enlisted Advisory Council for a 12-month period which
   commences the month of their induction (September) as a 12 OAY. For example, the 1998 12 OAY
   serve from September 1998 through September 1999. Therefore, the 1998 MAJCOM and DRU nom-
   inees would need retainability through 30 September 1999. The annual HQ AFPC/DPP nomination
   message outlines procedures to follow to obtain retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU nomi-
   nees who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Personnel Procurement Division, Reen-
   listment Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE), for assistance regarding retainability. Failure on the part of the
   MAJCOM or DRU to meet retainability requirements on their nominee will result in the nominee
   being withdrawn from the Air Force-level competition. If an individual is not selected as a 12 OAY,
   cancel the extension.
   3.4.4. Send statement of intent, signed and dated by the nominee, which includes the following state-
   ments verbatim:
       3.4.4.1. “I have not applied for a commissioning program and, if selected as a 12 OAY, will not
       apply for a commissioning program at any time during my tenure as a 12 OAY.”

        3.4.4.2. “If selected as a 12 OAY, I agree to serve in the capacity as an enlisted ambassador rep-
        resenting and assisting the Air Force in enlisted recruiting and retention efforts and matters. I
        understand I may be called upon by my MAJCOM commander and MAJCOM/CCC to publicize
        and promote ‘the Air Force way of life’ and attend events or other venues deemed appropriate
        which may positively impact upon recruiting and retention.”
        3.4.4.3. “I attest that the facts I have provided for this nomination are true and correct to the best
        of my knowledge.”
     3.4.5. If the MAJCOM or DRU will not submit nominations, send a letter or message to HQ AFPC/
     DPPPRS advising of this.
     3.4.6. Nomination packages will include:
        3.4.6.1. A general information page formatted as shown in Attachment 5.
        3.4.6.2. A write-up, limited to two single-spaced typewritten pages, using the AF Form 1206 for
        both pages. Nominations should include specific facts, achievements, and examples showing the
        individuals are exceptional. Achievements should distinguish the member from his or her peers.
        Nominations must include the following areas and cite examples that occurred only during the
        award period.

            Include any new initiatives or techniques developed by the member that positively impacted
            the unit and/or the mission. Include results of Air Force, MAJCOM, Numbered Air
            Force-level inspections and/or evaluations. Include awards received; e.g., NCO of the Quar-
            ter, Maintenance Professional of the Year, and so forth.
            3.4.6.2.2. Significant Self-Improvement. Show how the member developed or improved

            duties, and so forth. Include completion of any professional military education (PME) as well
            as awards earned during in-residence attendance. Include any off-duty education not directly

ment of intent that all nominees for the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year program must sign in order to
compete in the program (paragraph 3.4.4.) and adds a new paragraph requiring Command Chief Master
Sergeants (MAJCOM/CCCs) to utilize the annual 12 OAY for the purposes of enhancing Air Force reten-
tion and recruiting (3.4.11.). See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2001-1, for the complete IC. A
bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.


3.4.4. Send statement of intent, signed and dated by the nominee, which includes the following state-
ments verbatim:
3.4.4.1. “I have not applied for a commissioning program and, if selected as a 12 OAY, will not apply for
a commissioning program at any time during my tenure as a 12 OAY.”
3.4.4.2. “If selected as a 12 OAY, I agree to serve in the capacity as an enlisted ambassador representing
and assisting the Air Force in enlisted recruiting and retention efforts and matters. I understand I may be
called upon by my MAJCOM commander and MAJCOM/CCC to publicize and promote ‘the Air Force
way of life’ and attend events or other venues deemed appropriate which may positively impact upon
recruiting and retention.”
3.4.4.3. “I attest that the facts I have provided for this nomination are true and correct to the best of my
knowledge.”
3.4.11. Travel Funding for the 12 OAY. Fund travel from normal temporary duty (TDY) funds of the
unit to which the 12 OAY are assigned in order that they may attend the AFA convention, any follow-on
meetings of the AFA Enlisted Advisory Council, and all other events requiring their attendance in support
of recruiting and retention.
3.4.11.1. If unit funds are insufficient to fund travel, MAJCOMs will provide any additional funding to
the units to cover travel or other related expenses involving the 12 OAY in regard to public appearances
and so forth on behalf of recruiting and retention matters.
3.4.11.2. MAJCOM/CCCs will maintain records of all travel (cost, where the trips were taken, and
whether the unit or MAJCOM paid) performed by the 12 OAY in support of recruiting and retention.
They will report these statistics to the CMSAF quarterly.
3.4.11.3. If a 12 OAY is reassigned during his or her one-year tenure, the gaining unit and MAJCOM
funds the required travel. To assist in meeting out-of-pocket expenses while the 12 OAY attend the AFA
convention and any follow-on meetings and events, commands are authorized to award them $300 to help
defray these costs.
3.4.11.4. Commanders may fund these out-of-pocket expenses under their special morale and welfare
expenditure authority. Refer to AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds.
