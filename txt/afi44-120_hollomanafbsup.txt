AFI 44-120, 1 November 1999, is supplemented as follows. It establishes policies and procedures to
administer the military drug testing program at Holloman AFB. REFERENCES: Armstrong Laboratory
Drug Testing Division Base Level Assistance Guide; Military Drug Testing Program Instruction Guide
(Manual 1 and 2).
4.7.1.3.2. (Added) Installation Commander. Has appointed the Vice Wing Commander as the chairper-
son of the Cross Functional Oversight Committee.
4.7.1.4.5.1. (Added) A no-show is when a member was notified by their trusted agent or the first sergeant
and failed to report to Drug Demand Reduction (DDR). The Staff Judge Advocate will be notified, along
with the member's commander (see Attachment 1).
4.7.1.4.9.1. (Added) Daily Testing. The DDR office is the primary site for urinalysis collections. Testing
hours are from 0900-1200, unless prior arrangements have been made with the Drug Testing Program
Administrative Manager (DTPAM) for special circumstances. The hospital clinical laboratory is an alter-
nate testing site for after duty hours and weekend testing for other than daily testing, such as probable
cause or command directed.
4.7.5.2.2. (Added) Will coordinate with hospital laboratory to perform drug testing after duty hours when
necessary, and on weekends.
4.7.6.7.1.1. (Added) Observers, provided by units on a monthly rotating basis, will report to the DDR
office each morning at 0730 to find out if it will be a testing day. If it is not a testing day, individuals will
be sent back to their duty section.
4.7.6.7.1.2. (Added) Observers are briefed on their duties and responsibilities prior to the detail begin-
ning. They will always be the same sex as the testing participant.
4.7.7.3.1. (Added) Sweeps. Unit commanders will consult the Staff Judge Advocate before conducting
any unit sweeps or inspections. DDR personnel will coordinate with the unit commander and the Staff
Judge Advocate to determine the time, place, and method of urinalysis testing. Suggested locations

include, but are not limited to: the base theater, squadron activity rooms, hangars, and the DDR location
site. Sweep dates and times will be held in the strictest of confidence.
4.7.8.1.1. (Added) Member selected for testing will report to DDR between 0900-1200 on the day of his/
her selection/notification, unless excused in accordance with the provisions of this instruction. For all
excused individuals a date/time must be coordinated with the DTPAM by the unit trusted agent. Excused
members must be notified and tested immediately upon return from their TDY, leave, crew rest, or
off-duty period that caused them not to test on the day of selection.
4.7.8.1.2. (Added) Member unavailable due to TDY, leave, quarters, crew-rest, liberty, or personnel who
routinely work alternative duty weeks with "weekends" during the regular duty week must be tested upon
return to duty. DTPAM will coordinate with the unit trusted agent to test these individuals. Members who
are flying must be tested as soon as possible.
4.7.8.2.1. (Added) If the member does not have an ID card, he/she will notify their supervisor or first ser-
geant to come to DDR to verify their identity. Verification must be done in person, not over the phone.
4.7.8.2.2. (Added) Failure to report within 2 hours. Once the member is notified, he/she has 2 hours to
report to DDR. If the member reports after his/her 2-hour mark, a letter will be sent to his/her commander.
The commander will then respond to the letter with an explanation and with what actions were taken to
correct this discrepancy (see Attachment 2).
4.7.8.3.1. (Added) Samples often settle during shipping, resulting in a reduction in the measured amount
of the sample. In order to ensure that all samples arrive at the Air Force Drug Testing Lab with the
required 30 mls, the HAFB DDR office requires all personnel to provide at least 45 mls of urine at the
time of providing the sample.
4.7.9.1.1.1. (Added) The DTPAM will phone each squadron trusted agent to notify the agents that per-
sonnel from their squadron have been selected for drug testing. The list of names will then be faxed to the
trusted agent.
4.7.9.1.1.2. (Added) The trusted agent will wait by the fax machine to receive the list of names. If the
trusted agent has not received the list after 5 minutes, he/she will contact the DTPAM. The DTPAM will
then retry faxing the list. If the trusted agent again does not receive the list, an alternate fax number will
be given to the DTPAM or a "runner" (which has to be one of the appointed trusted agents) will be sent to
DDR to receive the list. Names will not be given out over the phone.
4.7.9.1.3.1. (Added) On the list next to the member's name, the trusted agent will annotate whether the
person has been contacted, on leave, on crew rest, TDY or will be in at a later time (after coordinating
with the DTPAM). Then the trusted agent will fax the list back to the DTPAM no later than 1130.
6.2.2.9.1. (Added) IO: Random Selection - personnel are selected by the Drug Testing computer pro-
gram. The selected member will be sent to DDR with a notification letter for random testing, given to
them by their trusted agent (see Attachment 3).
6.2.2.9.2. (Added) PC: Probable Cause. The member will report to DDR with a letter signed by his/her
commander and the member, stating probable cause (see Attachment 4).
6.2.2.9.3. (Added) VO: Consent. The member will be sent to DDR with a letter stating he or she is volun-
teering for this urinalysis, and two witnesses will have also signed the letter.
6.2.2.9.4. (Added) CC: Command Directed. This is coordinated with the Staff Judge Advocate. A letter
will accompany the member stating it is a command directed urinalysis (see Attachment 5).
