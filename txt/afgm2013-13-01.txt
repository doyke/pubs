MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
               MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: HQ USAF/A3/5
      1480 Air Force Pentagon
      Washington DC 20330-1480
SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum for TACP Deployments
By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum is
immediately implemented. Compliance with the Memorandum is mandatory. Specifically, the
guidance within this Memorandum expounds upon the requirements captured in AFI 10-403,
Deployment Planning and Execution, paragraph 1.9.1.37. To the extent its directions are
inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance
with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

This guidance is intended to address gaps in command relationships and deployment procedures
for Tactical Air Control Parties, (TACP), Air Support Operations Centers (ASOC), and Joint
Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) in order to support the Army’s new deployment and
rotation concept. TACPs typically deploy in support of the Army Force Generation Model
(ARFORGEN), and this guidance is designed to assist Air Force commanders where TACP
deployment procedures and organizations are not well established. For the purposes of this
guidance, the term TACP includes all TACP, ASOC, and JTAC general purpose forces.

This Memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from its date. There are no
releasibility restrictions on this memorandum.

1. Background: The Army has begun planning for deployments/rotations as part of the
Regionally Aligned Forces concept. Regional alignment is designed to enhance relationships
between planning staffs while improving a unit’s familiarity with an area of operations. TACP
general purpose forces typically deploy in direct support of the ARFORGEN.

2. Intent: Although TACPs deploy in direct support of Army forces, they typically remain under
the control of the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). The Command Relationships
paragraph (below) provides recommendations to the COMAFFOR for organizing TACPs. Since
TACP Unit Type Codes (UTC) are designated E-ARY enablers IAW reference (b), this
Guidance Memorandum (GM) is designed to specify compliance requirements. This GM
includes guidance for deployments through the Joint Staff Global Force Management Allocation
Plan (GFMAP), Non-GFMAP deployments, deployment lengths, Reception, Staging, Onward-
movement and Integration (RSO&I), and Lessons Learned.

3. Command Relationships: TACP units will continue to provide Direct Support to their
habitually aligned Army unit. In accordance with reference (b), deployed TACP Airmen will
remain under the Administrative Control (ADCON) of the COMAFFOR. Typically, the
COMAFFOR will also exercise Operational Control (OPCON) of deployed TACP Airmen.
Deployed TACP Airmen should be organized under an existing ASOS or Expeditionary ASOS
(EASOS) within the area of responsibility (AOR). This organizational structure applies to
deployed TACP units that support Army Brigade Combat Team (and/or lower echelons). If no
ASOS exists, it is recommended that the COMAFFOR establish a provisional EASOS or assign
the TACP to a squadron capable of providing ADCON, TACON and OPCON IAW reference (f).
If a TACP unit deploys in support of a Division (and/or higher echelon), it is recommended the
COMAFFOR establish a provisional EASOS or Expeditionary Air Support Operations Group, as
appropriate.

4. GFMAP deployments: Effective with the start of FY13 deployments, TACP units will deploy
in direct support of their habitually aligned Army unit(s) when ordered through the GFMAP. In
accordance with the ARFORGEN cycle, TACP units will deploy with all UTC identified
personnel and logistics detail (LOGDET) equipment unless tailored by the Combatant
Commander or Joint Task Force Commander. Deployments in support of OEF are well
established and are not included in this guidance.

5. Non-GFMAP deployments: TACP deployments or unit movements outside the GFMAP
process require HQ USAF/A3O-AC involvement to ensure these deployments/movements are
consistent with Secretary of the Air Force policy. HQ USAF/A3O-AC will coordinate with the
appropriate agencies and MAJCOMs to ensure adherence to rules that govern movement of
personnel and equipment.

6. Deployment length: TACP personnel will deploy with and redeploy with the supported Army
unit. TACP deployment length will align with the supported Army unit’s rotation
(approximately 9 months). TACP units with deployment lengths of 365 days, or greater, may
execute internal 6 month rotations.

7. RSO&I: An established ASOG/ASOS will perform the RSO&I function for the deploying
TACPs. For areas without an existing ASOG/ASOS, the tasked TACP unit is authorized to
support and/or perform the Advance Echelon (ADVON) Team responsibilities IAW reference
(e), as required.

8. Lessons Learned: The senior deployed TACP member will provide an After Action Report
(AAR) IAW reference (e). The AAR is needed to assist with identifying gaps and recommended
improvements for future deployments. TACP AARs will be provided to the theater ASOG and
the respective home-station chain of command. The Theater ASOG will provide consolidated
AARs quarterly to HQ USAF/A3O-AC and ACC/A3F.

9. The OPR for this guidance is HQ USAF/A3O-AC.
