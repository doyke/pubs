This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-4, Operations Planning: Air
& Space Expeditionary Force (AEF). It explains unit and individual responsibilities for the
prompt alert notification and/or recall of personnel during times of increased readiness or
contingencies. It describes the system for reporting unit recall progress to the 7 AF Commander
and sets up the structure for the initial Air Force Korea (USAFK) Alert and Recall Plan. It
applies to all Seventh Air Force or associated units (e.g., 607th Air and Space Operations Center
(607 AOC), 607th Air Support Operations Group (607 ASOG) and 694 Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group (694 ISRG)). The 51st Fighter Wing (51 FW) and 8th
Fighter Wing (8 FW) may be recalled by the 7 AF/CC but will publish their own wing directives.

            suit). (NOTE: If you are on duty at the time of the alert and you are in a uniform
            other than the BDU or flight suit, you will not be required to go home and change.
            You may be accounted for and then released to return home for the proper uniform,
            gear and personal hygiene as directed by director or unit commander).
            2.7.4.6. Do not make any stops on the way to your recall location except to notify the

            2.7.4.7. Remember the Force Protection conditions and take appropriate actions.
3. Recall/Alert Notifications. A pyramid notification system is required to facilitate immediate
response to a crisis. Recalls are accomplished in response to higher headquarters (HHQ)
direction, or as directed by the 7 AF Commander or a designated representative. The following
are 7 AF recall/alert notification methods:
     3.1. Recall/Alert Notification methods.
        3.1.1. Overt: Recall personnel using the fastest means available. This may include the
        use of Giant Voice, telephones, radios, public television including the Commander’s
        Access Channel, speaker-equipped vehicles, e-mail, or any other viable means of
        communication.
        3.1.2. Covert: Recall personnel as quickly as possible while minimizing public notice
        and actions which may alarm the general public. Use only telephone or personal contact;
        do NOT use Giant Voice, Commander’s Access Channel, radios, public television,
        speaker equipped vehicles, etc
7AFI10-401 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                       5


     3.1.3. Comm-Out: Recall personnel by personal contact only. To be used when
     communication systems are inoperative, cannot, or should not be used.
  3.2. Recall/Alert Notification types. 7 AF recalls will include five types of recalls listed
  below. Shift personnel will report to their duty locations unless directed to do otherwise by
  their unit commander or director.
     3.2.1. General Recall. The objective of a General Recall is to posture the entire
     organization for immediate action. All units will initiate 100% notification and
     accountability. All personnel, will report to work as directed, wearing field gear and
     Individual Protective Equipment and carrying/wearing chemical gear, as MOPP level
     dictates and prepared for wartime work schedules and duty. As directed, personnel on
     leave or TDY on- and/or off-peninsula are contacted and directed to return to their duty
     station. Unless specified otherwise, personnel are to report to their wartime duty
     locations. Attachment 2 identifies personnel who will be recalled.
     3.2.2. Selective Recall. The objective of a Selective Recall is to alert, inform or direct to
     duty specific personnel or functions. Selective recalls may be used to recall or alert key
     personnel to assess a crisis situation or to prepare for other type(s) of notification/recall.
     Recalled personnel will be prepared for wartime work schedules and duty. As directed,
     personnel on leave or TDY off-peninsula are contacted and directed to return to their duty
     station (NOTE: One example of this recall is a Senior Staff Recall). Attachment 2
     identifies who will be recalled.
     3.2.3. Initial Response Cell (IRC) Recall. The objective of an IRC recall is to recall
     those 7 AF (USAFK) commanders (minus 51 FW, 8 FW and following on forces group
     CCs), staff directors, and other agency leaders who the 7 AF/CC deems necessary to
     provide an initial assessment and recommended courses of action for a particular
     situation. Recalled personnel will be prepared for wartime work schedules and duty. As
     directed, personnel on leave or TDY off-peninsula are contacted and directed to return to
     their duty station. Attachment 2 identifies personnel who will normally be recalled.
     3.2.4. Crisis Action Team (CAT) Recall. The objective of a CAT recall is to
     immediately recall all 7 AF (USAFK) commanders (minus 51 FW, 8 FW and following
     on forces group CCs), staff directors, AOC division chiefs and other agency leaders who
     the 7 AF/CC deems necessary to assess a crisis situation. Recalled personnel will be
     prepared for wartime work schedules and duty. As directed, personnel on leave or TDY
     off-peninsula are contacted and directed to return to their duty station Attachment 2
     identifies personnel who will be recalled.
     3.2.5. Accountability/Alert Notification. The objective of an Accountability/Alert
     Notification is to verify the current location of, and disseminate time-sensitive
     information to all 7 AF associated personnel and their dependents that will, or may be,
     affected by an impending natural disaster or threat to a specific region/area or other
     critical situation. Unless directed otherwise, commanders will ensure contact is made
     with all affected members and their dependents who are believed to be in the affected
     area(s), and pass information to those individuals as directed. Attachment 2 identifies
     personnel who will be recalled. This type of recall may also be used to test the recall
     notification system. UCC and 7 AF/A1 personnel will report to their duty location to
     compile the accountability. All other personnel do not have to report for duty, but are
 6                                                               7AFI10-401 18 JANUARY 2012


        directed to note any problems with the notification process and pass details of such
        problems to their supervisor. Commanders/Directors will take whatever actions are
        necessary to assess the effectiveness of the recall test.
        3.2.6. Recall Instruction: If you are notified of a recall, notify the person below you on
        the recall chain. If you cannot reach the assigned individual, try their alternate. If neither
        are available, note the names, skip down to the next person and notify them. DO NOT
        BREAK THE CHAIN. Continue to attempt contact with anyone not reached by the
        initial attempt, however, do not delay your response and advise the UCC of any
        individual(s) not contacted. Personnel at the end of the recall roster will report the status
        of the recall to the UCC.
4. Procedures.
     4.1. Initiating a Recall or Alert Notification. The 7 AF/CC or his designee will direct the
     type of recall to conduct. Recall essential personnel are required to be immediately reachable
     via telephone (cellular or land line). The OCC will initiate the required recall procedures as
     defined in the 7 AF Recall Checklist and this instruction.
     4.2. Simulations: 7 AF/CC or his designated representative will determine when to simulate
     recalling or alerting personnel on leave/TDY on- or off-peninsula. This decision may be
     whether or not to physically recall or to simply notify these individuals. The OCC will
     ensure he/she has this guidance from the commander or his representative to disseminate it
     with 7 AF recalls/alert notifications.
     4.3. Reporting for General Recall and Accountability/Alert Notification.
        4.3.1. Personnel strength reporting is implemented in conjunction with the RST. The 7
        AF/CC will set the RST when directing a recall. This time will be passed to every
        individual through the recall script, and will be used as the baseline time to measure
        progress of the recall.
        4.3.2. Directors/unit commanders are required to report personnel strength data to their
        UCC at RST plus 60, 90, and 120 minutes. This data should be reported via the Unit
        Strength Accountability Worksheet (Recall Matrix Master) located under the Recall
        folder on the 7AF shared drive at P:\RECALL.
            4.3.2.1. The 7AF Personal Staff and Directorates, 607 AOC, and each
            Group/Squadron (607 ASOG, 694 ISRG, 607 SPTS and 607 MMS) have a POC who
            will access the Recall Matrix Master worksheet and report their numbers at the
            appropriate time, save the data, and exit the worksheet. The POC will repeat this
            action at each reporting time.
            4.3.2.2. The 7 AF/A1 will monitor progress and ensure the file is ready for use within
            15 minutes from report time (RST +60, RST +90, etc).
            4.3.2.3. If access to the Recall folder is not possible, each unit will record the number
            of personnel assigned, the number on leave or TDY, the number available for duty,
            and the number present for duty (PFD) at each interval (+60, +90, +120, etc) and call
            those figures in to 7 AF Staff UCC.
        4.3.3. For the 7 AF standard, units must have a minimum of 80 percent of available
        Airmen and Emergency-Essential civilians PFD NLT RST plus 2 hours. Continue recall
7AFI10-401 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                      7


      procedures until 100% accountability is reached. Directors and commanders should
      assess if 80 percent PFD will meet mission and capability requirements outside recall
      parameters and can make recall timelines more demanding for their organizations.
      4.3.4. The 7 AF/A1 will provide the Seventh Air Force commander/leadership with a
      status update at RST + 80, 110, 140, and 200 minutes and a final report after all units are
      100% complete by accessing the Recall Matrix Master Worksheet under the Recall
      Folder of the 7AF shared drive P:\RECALL.

5. Records Management.
   5.1. Refer to AFI 33-322, Record Management Program for instructions on storing and
   disposing of any records generated by this instruction.
6. Pyramid Recall Rosters (PRR).
   6.1. All pyramid recall rosters will contain, as a minimum, the effective date of the roster,
   the identity of the organization, the recall roster monitor’s name and contact information to
   include their DEROS and each unit member’s name, grade, residence address, residence
   telephone, and/or cellular phone number. Include a Privacy Act statement and the statements
   “FOUO” and that the roster will not be placed on a NIPRNET webpage, sent to a commercial
   email address, or sent over non-encrypted NIPR email. Finally, use attachment 3 as a guide
   for information on the reverse of the unit roster.
   6.2. Recall rosters may be e-mailed provided they are sent from “.mil” to “.mil” e-mail
   addresses and digitally encrypted using a Common Access Card or organizational account
   certificate. When providing a recall roster via e-mail, the e-mail must include the appropriate
   Privacy Act statement IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, and a warning not to
   forward to a commercial email address, or sent over non-encrypted NIPR email.
   6.3. Notification will include only essential, unclassified information. All information
   related to a recall is privileged FOUO and releasable only on a need-to-know basis.
   6.4. Treat accountability and availability data as sensitive and FOUO in nature.           See
   paragraph 4.3. for further instructions.
