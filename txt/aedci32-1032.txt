SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates the office symbols for the numerous AEDC organizations that were
reorganized as groups, squadrons, and staff directorates in 2006. It limits the voting members to
the four group commanders, Plans/Programs Director, Financial Management Director, and
 2                                                        AEDCI32-1032 7 SEPTEMBER 2012


Contracting Director. The reference to AEDCI 65-108 was replaced with AEDCI 90-700 and
the title shortened to AEDC Facilities Board.
1. Overview This procedure applies to all 3300 MILCON appropriations funded construction,
development, conversion, or extension of any kind, and 3400 appropriations funded facility and
infrastructure SRM projects. It also encompasses specially funded programs such as
Environmental, Military Family Housing, Quality of Life, Defense Energy Supply Command,
Anti-terrorism/Force Protection, and other special programs. This procedure results in a
prioritized list of 3400 investment projects, which are integrated into the request for proposal as
outlined in AEDCI 90-700, Capability Analysis and Risk Assessment.
2. Responsibility and Authority
2.1. The AEDC Commander (AEDC/CC) has the overall responsibility and accountability
for the operation of the Air Force installation. The AEDC/CC, assisted by the 704th Mission
Support Group (704 MSG) and the 704th Civil Engineer Squadron (704 CES), is responsible and
accountable to ensure all work accomplished for the Air Force on Air Force owned/controlled
real property is properly authorized and funded in accordance with all applicable laws, policies,
and regulations. The AEDC/CC has delegated overall management of this task to the 704 MSG
and 704 CES (paragraphs 5.2., 5.2.1., and 5.2.2.). The resulting CES program will be briefed to
the Corporate Board for approval.
     2.2. The Base Civil Engineer is responsible for ensuring all project-level work is validated
     and approved by the proper authority before it is submitted to the facilities board for
     prioritization. Project-level work is defined as maintenance and/or repair work greater than
     $50K and minor construction work greater than $15K. Project approvals are documented in
     the AEDC Work Management System. Work less than project-level is approved and
     prioritized in accordance with the Synergen workflow process.
        2.2.1. Delegation of Project Approval Authority for appropriated and non-appropriated
        funded projects was delegated to Center Commanders by the Headquarters Air Force
        Materiel Command Civil Engineer (HQ AFMC/A7C) on 2 August 2004. This document
        is maintained in the 704 CES programming office.
        2.2.2. The re-delegated approval authority for appropriated and non-appropriated funded
        projects down to, but not limited to, the Base Civil Engineer level was approved by the
        AEDC/CC on 24 September 2009. The contractor Resource Management and Work
        Control level are delegated authority as stated in section 4.3.1 of the current Performance
        Work Statement. These documents are maintained in the 704 CES programming office.
3. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES
     3.1. Identifying Requirements. Maintenance, Repair, and Construction requirements are
     identified by a number of methods. Building Managers, Systems Engineers, Business Area
     Managers, Work Breakdown Structure Managers, or other personnel identify the requirement
     and initiate a work request. The work request is reviewed by the Civil Engineer Work
     Control Function to ensure the requirement is valid. A rough order of magnitude cost is then
     developed. Work requests exceeding the dollar thresholds stated in paragraph 5.2. are
     referred to programming and a project is initiated. 704 CES and contractor programmers
     review the requirement to see if it can be combined with other similar facility work. A
AEDCI32-1032 7 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  3


   project number is assigned in the Automated Civil Engineer System and the project is
   established on the Center’s Long Range Plan, which is maintained by 704 CES.
   3.2. Prioritization. After facility/infrastructure requirements are identified, the Chief
   Programmer will develop facility project programming proposals and present them to the
   Facilities Board for approval. Consideration should be given to the following criteria when
   prioritizing projects: safety, regulatory, follow-on projects, Infrastructure Condition Index,
   Installation Readiness Review Rating, and mission impact.
      3.2.1. Facilities Board (FB). A listing of Facility Requirements for each real property
      contract program is presented to the FB for approval. The FB will be composed of the
      following personnel:

  member is unable to attend, a deputy or qualified senior staff person will assume full
  membership responsibilities and will represent the member. Only the FB voting member and
  designated alternates will be allowed to vote on actions before the board; however, other
  personnel may attend meetings and participate as a guest.
   3.2.3. Board Meetings. The Chief Programmer will schedule board meetings a minimum of
   two times a year. The FB will also meet upon the call of the chair whenever consideration of
   real property requirement, utilization, programming, or other related actions are required.
   Routine, special, or technical actions not requiring or warranting the board review will be
   coordinated with the appropriate major staff officer or concerned board representatives.
   These will be presented to the chair or his designated representative for approval.
   3.2.4. Meeting Minutes. Meeting minutes will be prepared by the recorder within ten
   working days and signed by the Recorder and FB Chair. Copies of the minutes will then be
   distributed to all board members.
   3.2.5. Facilities Board Working Panel (FBWP). The FBWP will be composed of qualified
   representatives of the offices listed below. The FBWP will work to prioritize the Center’s
   projects and accomplish any necessary coordination or staff actions at least two weeks prior
   to the FB meeting.

4. Authority of the FBWP:
4.1. The panel has the authority to appoint ad hoc task groups to perform special studies,
surveys, and to do research projects.
4.2. All actions of the panel are subject to review and approval of the FB.
4.3. 704 CES is delegated the authority to act upon space assignments and changes in
utilization when it involves “small” incidental moves. Larger wholesale moves of personnel
or functions will require approval from the facilities board. These actions can be accomplished
by coordinating the proper staff package with the FB members in lieu of waiting for the FB to
meet. The support contractor will maintain miscellaneous record keeping for real estate items,
disposal program, and facility contracts within the CC’s approval authority. The results of these
actions will be reported to the board.
