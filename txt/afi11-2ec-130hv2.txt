1.3. Key Words and Definitions:
   1.3.1. "Will" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. See attachment 1 for definitions of Deviation, Major and Minor Errors.
1.4. Procedures.
   1.4.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
   conducting flight evaluations and Paragraph 1.6 for emergency procedure evaluations
   (EPE). To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly
   familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
   1.4.2. The examinee or examiner may fly in any seat that will best enable the examiner to
   conduct a thorough evaluation.
   1.4.3. Examiners will brief the examinees on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the
   evaluation, including evaluation criteria, prior to flight. The examinee is responsible for all
   mission planning.
   1.4.4. Examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight, including the
   examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area/sub area grades assigned, and additional
   training required.
 6                                                  AFI11-2EC-130HV2 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


     1.4.5. Examiners will not fail equipment during flight evaluations, but may deny the use of
     systems not affecting safety of flight.
1.5. Grading Instructions: Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.5.1. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.5.2. The grading system for most areas in this volume is a three-level system (Q/Q-/U).
     Areas identified as "Critical" in Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 have a two-level system (Q/U).
     A critical area is defined as an area or event in which unsatisfactory performance by the
     examinee could result in loss of life or damage to equipment. If the examinee receives a U in
     any critical area, assign an overall Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).
     1.5.3. Required areas are indicated with an "R" in Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 for specific
     evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated. Flight examiners may evaluate any other
     areas observed, at their discretion.
        1.5.3.1. When a required area cannot be evaluated in the aircraft due to equipment
        malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, that area may
        be evaluated by an alternate method (simulator, procedural trainer, or verbal
        examination). Complete the evaluation on an additional flight when, in the examiner's
        judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method.
        1.5.3.2. Document the reasons for using alternate methods and the methods used in the
        Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
        1.5.3.3. Aircrew may maintain qualification in prior crew positions if applicable
        evaluation areas are evaluated on subsequent evaluations. For example, Mission Crew
        Supervisors (MCS) maintain Analysis Operator (ANO) or Acquisition Operator (AO)
        qualification if additional ANO or AO evaluation areas are evaluated on subsequent MCS
        evaluations. This also applies to Senior Mission Crew Commanders (SRMCC) who have
        upgraded from the Mission Crew Commander (MCC) qualification. Annotate additional
        qualifications maintained in Section D of AF Form 8.
        1.5.3.4. Due to the congruity of ANO and AO duties aboard the EC-130H, an MCS
        evaluator may administer an evaluation updating an examinee’s MCS and ANO or AO
        qualification, regardless of evaluator’s crew position indicator. The Aural Recognition
        Test (ART) demonstrates the MCS’ qualification in language- or signal-specific skills.
     1.5.4. The examiner will compare examinee's performance for each area with the standards
     provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade. Derive the overall evaluation grade
     from the area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks IAW AFI 11-
     202V2 and this volume.
        1.5.4.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
        grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when
        specific situations are not covered.
AFI11-2EC-130HV2 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                7


       1.5.4.2. Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall
       grade.
1.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. The EPE is a ground requisite on all MSN and Qual
evaluations. Document the EPE on ACC Form 180, Temporary Flight Evaluation Certificate.
Grading criteria for each required item are listed in Chapter 3. This evaluation will include areas
commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) training level and event
qualifications.
   1.6.1. The following items are required on all emergency procedure evaluations:
       1.6.1.1. Emergency Procedures. All Boldface emergencies will be evaluated.
           1.6.1.1.1. All Boldface will be evaluated by completion of a written Boldface sheet at
           the beginning of the EPE. This will complete the Boldface requisite for the
           evaluation. Any incorrectly completed Boldface will result in a “U” for the Boldface
           requisite. The EPE will not be started until successful completion of the Boldface
           requisite.
           1.6.1.1.2. Aircrews may conduct simulated emergencies in flight while an evaluation
           is in progress. Simulated emergencies conducted in flight are graded in the flight
           phase and do not take the place of an EPE.
           1.6.1.1.3. Aircraft Mission System / General Knowledge.
           1.6.1.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM).
           1.6.1.1.5. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Pilots only.
   1.6.2. All INSTM/QUAL EPEs will include the following additional items:
       1.6.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures.
   1.6.3. All Mission (MSN) EPEs will include the following items (tailor MSN evaluation
   scenarios to unit tasking/mission).
       1.6.3.1. Weapons system operation.
       1.6.3.2. Electronic Attack (EA)/Self Protection Systems
       1.6.3.3. Evasive action/Threat Reaction.
       1.6.3.4. Weapons employment.
   1.6.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
   until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
   accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory
   Boldface accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful reevaluation is
   accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires additional training,
   the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished before the next
   flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   1.6.5. A single EPE may be administered to fulfill the requisites for the combined
   MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluation. The combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length
   to ensure all required areas for each evaluation are accomplished.
   1.6.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:

        1.6.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
        1.6.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
        omission or commission.
        1.6.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.7. Additional Training.
     1.7.1. Examiners are responsible for assigning and documenting additional training
     requirements. Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.
     1.7.2. Required additional training will not be accomplished on the same flight as the
     evaluation. EXCEPTION: Required additional training on the same flight as the evaluation
     is allowed when unique situations present valuable training opportunities (i.e., thunderstorm
     avoidance, crosswind landings, etc.). This option requires examiner discretion and judicious
     application. When used, the examinee must be informed when additional training begins and
     ends.
1.8. Unsatisfactory Performance:
     1.8.1. Rechecks may be accomplished on the ground or in flight, at the discretion of the
     examiner. Rechecks will normally be administered by an examiner other than the one who
     administered the original evaluation.
     1.8.2. If the examiner observes another aircrew member jeopardizing safe flight, the
     examiner (if qualified in the position) will assume the duties of that aircrew member. This
     does not mean the examiner must assume the examinee's position any time unsatisfactory
     performance is observed. If the examiner feels the examinee can continue safely with
     supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the examinee's duties.
1.9. Examinations.
     1.9.1. Open book examinations. Derive the questions from flight manuals and governing
     AFIs and command directives. An open book examination is a requisite for the QUAL and
     MSN evaluations. The open book QUAL exam will consist of a minimum of 50 questions;
     the open book MSN exam will consist of a minimum of 25 questions, at least 25% derived
     from tactical doctrine documents related to EC-130H combat operations (AIR FORCE
     TACTICS, TECHNIQUES and PROCEDURES (AFTTP)).
     1.9.2. Closed book examinations are general knowledge 50 question written tests. Test
     questions are derived from the applicable crew position Master Question File (MQF).
     1.9.3. Pilots and navigators will take an instrument examination. In order to take the exam,
     crewmembers must be current in the ground training event, Instrument Refresher Course
     (IRC). The IRC is a ground training item and will be accomplished IAW AFMAN 11-210
     Instrument Refresher Program.

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.2. Required areas for flight evaluations are shown in Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 and
   for EPEs in Para 1.6.1 When it is impractical or not possible to accomplish a required flight
   evaluation area in-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method in order to complete the
   evaluation. Document the reason and type of alternate method used in the Comments portion
   of the AF Form 8. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by
   an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the
   evaluation.
       2.1.2.1. Areas annotated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation.
   2.1.3. Publications Check. Publications checks will be accomplished as specified in the
   unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
   CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific grading
   criteria. Therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists. As all the CRM
   skills listed on the AF IMT 4031 CRM Skills Criteria are included/embedded, use of the IMT
   4031 is unnecessary for evaluations in the EC-130H. The Stan/Eval trend program can be
   used to measure the effectiveness of CRM training.
2.2. Requirements. This volume requires completion only of those evaluations specified in this
chapter or a combination thereof. Special qualifications (i.e., Functional Check Flight) do not
require initial or recurring evaluations; annotate these qualifications on the letter of certification.
   2.2.1. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with a minimum of simulated
   events. Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.
       2.2.1.1. Pilot Instrument/Qualification evaluations should include approaches to airfields
       other than home station or deployed locations when possible.
2.3. Formal Course Evaluations.
   2.3.1. Fly syllabus evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile guidelines if stated, or on a
   mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Formal course guidelines may
   be modified, based on local operating considerations or examiner judgment, to complete the
   evaluation.
2.4. Instructor Evaluations.
   2.4.1. Conduct instructor evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and Chapter 3
   of this volume. Thoroughly evaluate the examinee's instructor knowledge and ability.
   2.4.2. Initial Instructor. The emphasis of initial instructor evaluations is instructor duties.
   These evaluations should be scheduled with a crewmember requiring training (PFT, or
   unqualified). Crewmembers may use their initial instructor evaluation to satisfy requirements
 10                                                 AFI11-2EC-130HV2 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


     of a periodic evaluation, provided all evaluation requirements for the periodic evaluation are
     accomplished by the examinee (not only instructed). Mission Crew Initial Instructor
     evaluations may be conducted in the COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulator (CCMCS).
     2.4.3. Requalification (RQ) Instructor. The emphasis of all RQ instructor evaluations is
     instructor duties. These evaluations may be scheduled with a crewmember requiring training
     (PFT, or unqualified). Crewmembers may use their requalification instructor evaluation to
     satisfy requirements of a periodic evaluation, provided all evaluation requirements for the
     periodic evaluation are accomplished by the examinee (not only instructed).
     2.4.4. Recurring Instructor Evaluations. Instructor duties will be evaluated on recurring
     periodic evaluations for crewmembers having completed an INIT INSTR evaluation. The
     emphasis of recurring instructor evaluations is accomplishment of all required items for the
     basic duties of the crew position. The examinee is required to demonstrate instructional
     ability in a graded area. Examiners will brief specific area(s) in which examinees will
     demonstrate instructional ability, and document these on the back of the AF Form 8.
     Recurring instructor evaluations may be scheduled with a student provided the instructor is
     evaluated (performing not instructing) all required items and the student is able to complete
     their syllabus event in its entirety.
2.5. Evaluation Requirements Tables. Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 depict grading areas for
specific crew position evaluations. Unless otherwise noted, all areas apply to EC-130H
COMPASS CALL (all blocks).

Notes:


1. Both a Precision Radar Approach (PAR) and an Instrument Landing System (ILS) are
required if equipment and facilities are available and traffic flow permits. If a PAR or ILS
approach is not available, the flight evaluation may be complete with one precision approach
flown. Do not verbally evaluate the approach that wasn’t flown.
2. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) will be evaluated on mission evaluations for all pilots
maintaining an air-to-air refueling qualification. If air-to-air refueling is not evaluated, document
as a restriction on the AF Form 8 as a restriction IAW AFI 11-202V2. Failure to evaluate air-to-
air refueling does not otherwise affect aircraft qualification. See para 4.3.3. for exceptions.
Requalification in air-to-air refueling will be documented as an RQ evaluation.
3. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) will be evaluated on INSTM/QUAL evaluations only if: 1. Pilot
has not been given an INIT MSN evaluation by the time he/she enters phase for a periodic
INSTM/QUAL evaluation; and 2. Pilot has been given appropriate AAR training.

                                     PILOT EVALUATIONS

4.1. General.
     4.1.1. The criteria contained here and in Chapter 3 apply to all pilot flight evaluations. The
     following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for specific events
     and instrument final approaches.

Table 4.1. General Criteria.

Q            Altitude               +/- 200 feet
             Airspeed               +/- 5 knots (but not less than Vmca)
             Course                 +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)
             TACAN Arc              +/- 2 NM
Q-           Altitude               +/- 300 feet
             Airspeed               +/- 10 knots (but not less than Vmca)
             Course                 +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)
             TACAN Arc              +/- 3 NM
U                                   Exceeded Q- limits
     4.1.2. The baseline qualification for EC-130H Mobility Pilot Development (MPD Pilots is as
     described below:
        4.1.2.1. Pilots trained under the MPD syllabus are qualified to perform INSTM/QUAL
        pilot duties in the left and right seat.
        4.1.2.2. Pilots trained under the MPD syllabus are qualified to perform MSN duties in
        the right seat only.
        4.1.2.3. MPD graduates do not require a separate INIT INSTM/QUAL evaluation when
        transitioning to Aircraft Commander. The skill set is identical for both positions. If an
        INSTM/QUAL evaluation is administered in conjunction with the INIT MSN evaluation
        leading to Aircraft Commander Certification document the INSTM/QUAL and INIT
        MSN on separate blocks in the flight phase section of the AF Form 8 and designate crew
        position as MP on the AF Form 8.
4.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all pilot
duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW
applicable technical orders, directives and published procedures.
4.3. Requirements: General. Pilot evaluations will be flown from the left seat. Pilot graduates
of the Mobility Pilot Development program will be evaluated in the right seat for MSNs and in
the left seat for INSTM/QUAL checks. Instructor pilot evaluations may be flown from either
seat. The evaluator pilot may sit in either seat during evaluations. Two complete aircraft
 24                                                AFI11-2EC-130HV2 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


commander evaluations will not be accomplished on the same sortie. Note: A single evaluator
pilot may administer an aircraft commander and one or more pilot evaluation(s) on the same
sortie.
   4.3.1. Aircraft Commander.
      4.3.1.1. Qualified aircraft commanders will be the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) while being
      evaluated. Unqualified pilots will not be designated PIC.
      4.3.1.2. Pilots not qualified as aircraft commanders may be designated as the PIC for
      purposes of the aircraft commander upgrade evaluation. Unit commanders will sign these
      flight authorizations. In cases where the pilot is not designated as PIC, the evaluator pilot
      or another AC qualified pilot will be designated as the PIC. At no time will an
      unqualified pilot or a Previously Qualified Pilot (PQP) who has not completed training
      IAW AFI 11-2EC-130E/HV1 be designated as the PIC.
   4.3.2. Instrument/Qualification. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas. Instrument
   evaluations may not be conducted separately from qualification evaluations. Do not complete
   an instrument/qualification evaluation unless, as a minimum, the following are observed in
   flight: an instrument takeoff; one full low or high altitude instrument approach procedure
   (IAP); one precision approach; one non-precision approach; one landing. NOTE: One of the
   approaches must be simulated engine out (mobility pilot development program pilots and
   above).
      4.3.2.1. For non-instructor qualified pilot evaluations without the availability of an
      instructor pilot, the evaluator pilot will occupy the right seat for simulated emergency
      approaches, landings and go-arounds. The evaluator pilot will perform all normal copilot
      duties and set the affected throttle for simulated three-engine operations.
      4.3.2.2. Initial/Re-qualification Evaluations. C-130 basic initial/re-qualification, aircraft
      commander upgrade, and instructor upgrade are normally conducted at Little Rock AFB
      and update the eligibility for instrument/qualification evaluations, except as noted in
      paragraph 2.5 of this instruction.
   4.3.3. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR)/Receiver Qualification. Applies to all EC-130 pilots.
   Complete initial/requalification air-to-air refueling qualification IAW ACC-approved syllabi.
   Initial qualification should occur on the initial mission evaluation. If unable to complete the
   mission evaluation due to lack of clearance, a SPOT evaluation should be given to establish
   qualification in air-to-air refueling. The individual’s training records and Unit Letter of
   Certifications will be updated to reflect the qualification. Following initial/requalification,
   evaluate this area on mission evaluations, to the max extent possible. As a last resort,
   SQ/CCs may authorize verbal evaluation of AAR for Mobility Pilot Development Graduates,
   provided it is not an initial AAR evaluation, or it was not verbally evaluated on the previous
   evaluation. Failure to evaluate air-to-air refueling does not otherwise affect aircraft
   qualification.
      4.3.3.1. If initial AAR qualification was established on a previous SPOT evaluation for
      individuals identified in para 4.3.3., then the AAR portion of the Initial
      mission/qualification evaluation can be verbally evaluated.
AFI11-2EC-130HV2 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               25


   4.3.4. Mission. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas. All mission evaluations require
   a COMPASS CALL mission profile with at least two turns in the mission orbit. Do not
   simulate the mission crew. Instrument/qualification evaluations may be completed on the
   same sortie as mission evaluations if the flight profile allows completion of all required areas
   for both evaluations. Mission evaluations will be based on unit scenarios and mission crew
   training. Threats for takeoff, on-station, tactical repositioning, retrograde procedures and
   recovery will be based on training required by the COMPASS CALL mission crew.
   Defensive slides and orbit positioning maneuvering may be flown if prior airspace
   coordination has been accomplished. Combat descents will not be performed during mission
   evaluations. All defensive maneuvers may be verbally evaluated during the mission if
   appropriate to the scenario.
4.4. Grading Criteria. See Table 2.3 for applicability to instrument/qualification or mission
evaluations.

NOTES
1: The following criteria is written to generally apply to all landings. Flight examiners must
apply this criteria judiciously to allow for the unique characteristics of each type of landing.
Where runway configuration, arresting cable placement, or flight manual limitations require an
adjustment to the desired touchdown point, a simulated runway threshold will be identified and
the grading criteria applied accordingly. For instrument approaches, the examinee should utilize
a normal glide slope from either the decision height or from a point where visual acquisition of
the runway environment is made.
2. Specific items to evaluate include threshold altitude / airspeed, runway alignment, flare,
touchdown speed and landing in a crab.

                               NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The criteria contained here and in Chapter 3 apply to all navigator flight
evaluations.
5.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all
navigator duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems,
IAW applicable flight manuals, and directives.
5.3. Requirements: EC-130H Navigators should receive a combined MSN/QUAL evaluation
when possible. For individuals unable to participate in MSN activities, administer a QUAL only.
   5.3.1. Qualification. See Table 2.4 for required evaluation areas.
       5.3.1.1. Simulator Evaluations. Navigators with 3 or more years experience in EC-130H
       aircraft may accomplish recurring qualification evaluations in the simulator (OFT, WST,
       or SNS) with 55 ECG/CC approval; however, use simulators as a last resort to perform
       evaluations. Do not conduct consecutive qualification evaluations in the simulator.
       (EXCEPTION: Formal school NRQ [basic re-qualification] students will normally
       accomplish evaluations in the SNS).
   5.3.2. Mission. See Table 2.4 for required areas. Mission evaluations will be based on unit
   scenarios and mission crew training. Threats for takeoff, on-station, tactical repositioning,
   retrograde procedures and recovery will be based on training required by COMPASS CALL
   mission crew.
   5.3.3. Air-to-Air Refueling.
       5.3.3.1. Initial Air-to-Air Refueling Qualification. Complete initial/requalification air-
       to-air refueling qualification IAW ACC-approved syllabi. Initial qualification should
       occur on the initial mission evaluation. If unable to complete the mission evaluation due
       to lack of clearance, a SPOT evaluation should be given to establish qualification in air-
       to-air refueling. Following initial/requalification, evaluate this area on mission
       evaluations, to the max extent possible. As a last resort, SQ/CCs may authorize verbal
       evaluation, provided it is not an initial evaluation, or it was not verbally evaluated on the
       previous evaluation. Failure to evaluate air-to-air refueling does not otherwise affect
       aircraft qualification.
       5.3.3.1.1. If initial AAR qualification was established on a previous SPOT evaluation for
       individuals identified in para 5.3.3.1., then the AAR portion of the Initial
       mission/qualification evaluation can be verbally evaluated.
       5.3.3.2. Recurring Air-to-Air Refueling Qualification. Navigators qualified in AAR will
       be scheduled for an air-to-air refueling profile. Following initial/requalification, evaluate
       this area on mission evaluations, to the max extent possible. As a last resort, if AAR
       cannot be evaluated in flight, SQ/CCs may authorize verbal evaluation, provided it is not
       an initial AAR evaluation, or it was not verbally evaluated on the previous evaluation.
       Failure to evaluate air-to-air refueling does not otherwise affect aircraft qualification.
5.4. Grading Criteria:

                           FLIGHT ENGINEER EVALUATIONS

6.1. General. The criteria contained in this chapter and Chapter 3 applies to all flight engineer
flight evaluations.
6.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform flight
engineer duties safely and effectively IAW applicable technical orders, instructions, and
directives.
6.3. Requirements:
   6.3.1. Mission/Qualification Evaluations. See Table 2.5 for required evaluation areas. EC-
   130H flight engineers will normally receive a combined MSN/QUAL evaluation. For
   individuals unable to participate in MSN activities, administer a QUAL (to include AAR)
   only. If the mission evaluation is conducted independently of the qualification evaluation, a
   mission EPE must be conducted and annotated in the ground phase section of the mission AF
   Form 8
       6.3.1.1. Initial mission or mission/qualification evaluations will include in-flight air-to-
       air refueling and a mission orbit. Recurring mission/qualification evaluations should be
       scheduled for a combined air-to-air refueling and mission orbit. If initial AAR
       qualification was established on the previous QUAL evaluation for individuals identified
       in para 6.3.1., then the AAR portion of the Initial MSN evaluation can be verbally
       evaluated.
   6.3.2. Mission Evaluations. Mission evaluations will include in-flight air-to-air refueling
   and will be based on established training scenarios and mission crew training requirements.
   Threats for takeoff, on-station, tactical repositioning, retrograde procedures and recovery will
   be based on training required by COMPASS CALL mission crew. Recurring MSN
   evaluations should be combined with a QUAL evaluation.
   6.3.3. Qualification Evaluations. See Table 2.5. for required evaluation areas
   6.3.4. Air Refueling.
       6.3.4.1. Initial Air Refueling Qualification. Complete initial/requalification air-to-air
       refueling certification IAW ACC-approved syllabi. Initial qualification should occur on
       the initial mission evaluation. If unable to complete the mission evaluation due to lack of
       clearance, a QUAL (to include AAR) or SPOT evaluation should be given to establish
       qualification in air-to-air refueling. The individual’s training records and Unit Letter of
       Certifications will be updated to reflect the qualification.
       6.3.4.2. Recurring Air Refueling Qualification.           Following initial/requalification,
       evaluate this area on mission evaluations. Flight Engineers qualified in AR will be
       scheduled for an air-to-air refueling profile. As a last resort if AAR cannot be evaluated
       in flight, SQ/CCs may authorize FEs to verbally evaluate air-to-air refueling provided it
       is not an initial evaluation, or was not verbally evaluated on the previous evaluation.
       Failure to evaluate air-to-air refueling does not otherwise affect aircraft qualification.
6.4. Grading Criteria:

   8.3.1. Mission/Qualification Evaluations. See Table 2.7 for required evaluation areas.
   Evaluation profiles will vary by area of responsibility based on mission kit and simulator
   scenario availability. Threats for takeoff, on station, and recovery as well as tactical
   repositioning and retrograde procedures may be input by the FE and will be based on the
   scenario and evaluation requirements. Scenarios should incorporate sufficient threats to
   adequately assess the examinee’s knowledge of potential enemy orders of battle and threat
   capabilities. SRMCC/MCC and MCS/ANO/AO Crew Position Indicators are similar aircrew
   specialties for evaluation purposes.
       8.3.1.1. Mission crew INIT MSN/QUAL evaluations will be conducted in accordance
       with current ACC syllabi. All other SRMCC, MCC, MCS, ANO, AO, and initial Mission
       Crew Instructor evaluations may be conducted in the aircraft and/or CCMCS.
       8.3.1.2. More than one mission crew position may be evaluated on a sortie provided a
       separate evaluator is assigned for each crew position.
       8.3.1.3. Additional crewmembers may complete elements from previously incomplete
       evaluations, provided the primary evaluation is not impacted, without additional
       evaluators.
       8.3.1.4. MCS evaluations should be conducted by evaluators of like Crew Position
       Indicator. MCS evaluations will include an ART unless ANO/AO qualification does not
       apply to an examinee. Cross-Crew Position Indicator evaluations update MCS and
       ANO/AO qualifications as required. MCS evaluations will include search and targeting
       of signals to update ANO or AO qualification on the letter of certifications. This should
       be completed during phases of flight the examinee will not be performing primary duties
       as the MCS. Should these areas not be evaluated, ANO or AO qualification will not be
       updated and the examiner will annotate applicable restrictions on the AF Form 8. When
       the individual upgrading to MCS is already an instructor qualified ANO/AO,
       instructional ability will be evaluated as an ANO/AO. Instructional ability will not be
       evaluated in the upgrade crew position.
       8.3.1.5. If no FE of the same language is available for Analysis Operator (not MCS
       qualified) evaluations in the CCMCS, the most experienced Analysis Operator available,
       who is of the same language as the examinee, will be scheduled to translate for the FE.
       8.3.1.6. Mission crewmember evaluations may be conducted in either the aircraft or the
       CCMCS.
