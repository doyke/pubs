                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This Air Force instruction establishes policies, roles, and responsibilities to
ensure integrated planning, programming, budgeting and execution, effective stewardship, and
sustainment of the Air Force Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3)
enterprise. In addition, it provides a framework for efficiently managing, controlling, and
integrating the five functions of the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) and ensures
Air Force NC3 personnel are properly organized, trained, and equipped to provide the five
specified functions that support nuclear deterrence operations. The five functions enabled by
NC3 systems are Situation Monitoring, Decision Making, Force Direction, Force Management,
and Planning (CJCSI 3280.01C, (S) National Military Command System (NMCS)).
1.2. Overview. The NCCS provides connectivity capabilities for the President of the United
States to direct personnel, equipment, and procedures for controlling nuclear operations.
     1.2.1. NC3 Definition. CJCSI 3280.01C, (S) National Military Command System (NMCS),
     definition of NC3 is: The collection of activities, processes, and procedures performed by
     appropriate commanders and support personnel who, through the chain of command, allow
     for decisions to be made based on relevant information, and allow those decisions to be
     communicated to forces for execution. NC3 is a system of systems, stretching across
     services, combatant commands, and other Department of Defense (DoD) entities.
     1.2.2. Air Force NC3 Mission. The NC3 mission is composed of Command, Control, and
     Communications assets to provide connectivity from the President or Secretary of Defense
     through the NMCS to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a worldwide, as well as
     theater, nuclear war. This includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems
     and those systems used for force management, planning, situation monitoring, decision-
     making, and force direction. The strategic portion is integral to and ensures the performance
     of critical strategic functions of the Global Command and Control System. CJCSI 5119.01C,
     Charter for the Centralized direction, Management, Operation, and technical Support of the
     Nuclear Command, Control, and Communication System.
1.3. Classification and Security Information. Refer to AFI 31-401, Information Security
Program Management for classification and security information.
1.4. Compliance. Commanders at all levels shall ensure compliance with:
     1.4.1. This AFI and approved Major Command (MAJCOM) functional/activity-specific
     instructions.
     1.4.2. Combatant Commander, Air Force, and MAJCOM directives, Operations Plans
     (OPLANs), Support Plans (SPLANs), Operations Orders, procedures, and special

     events to the Nuclear Working Group, Nuclear Issues Resolution and Integration Board,
     Nuclear Oversight Board, Warfighting Integration Governance and other meetings as
     applicable for decision and action. The AF NC3 COI may also function as the HAF-level
     injection point to other governance bodies as directed by higher authority in part but not
     limited to NC3 plans, programs, and requirements.
     2.1.13.4. Consist of a core group of O-6s, GS-15s, or designated subject matter experts
