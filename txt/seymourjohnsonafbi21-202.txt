   dinate with the owning organization for towing or movement of the aircraft to an area where it can be
   safelyparked without interfering with taxiing aircraft or airdrome flying operations.
   5.13. If a disabled aircraft is blocking the active runway, the aircraft must be removed in a safe and
   expeditious manner. If insufficient time is available or the aircraft is damaged to an extent that the air-
   craft cannot be lifted or towed off of the runway within sufficient time, one of the following methods
   may be used:
WARNING: Either method is likely to cause further damage to the aircraft and should only be used
when time is the most urgent consideration. Time permitting; the coordination and approval by the
4 FW/CC or designated representative must be obtained prior to moving the aircraft.
      5.13.1. Towing with tow vehicle and debog/reverse tow sling assembly. Connect debog/reverse
      tow sling to a major structural component such as the main landing gear or tail hook assembly. For
      C-17, C-5, C-141B, C-130, E-8, KC-135, and RC-135 aircraft, attach sling to the main landing
      gear using each gear towing eye if installed. For heavy aircraft use the 916 ARW Crash Recovery
      reverse tow cables and recovery assistance.
      5.13.2. If the main landing gear or tail hook is inaccessible, loop the cables or sling assembly
      around the tail assembly section of the aircraft and avoid looping the cable/sling assembly around
      the vertical stabilizers.
      5.13.3. If using a tow cable; attach a cable to each tow vehicle and drag the affected aircraft off the
      active runway or taxiway.
      5.13.4. Pushing disabled aircraft off the active runway with a bulldozer. This method is used as a
      last resort. 4 FW/CC will assess if the aircraft is beyond economical repair and authorize the
      removal by heavy equipment. If the tow vehicle is unable to tow the affected aircraft for any rea-
      son, the OSC will contact MOC and request a bulldozer from 4 CES Heavy Equipment Section to
      assist crash recovery with the removal of the aircraft. The crash recovery Team Chief will instruct
      the bulldozer operator to push damaged aircraft clear of the active runway.
   5.14. All personnel involved in crash recovery operations will adhere to recovery and safety proce-
   dures per aircraft specific Technical Orders and AFOSH 91 series standards.
   5.15. Communication between the Civil Engineer Squadron, Fire Protection, and Crash Recovery
   will be maintained to ensure aircraft recovery actions are performed as safely and quickly as possible.
   5.16. Aircraft maintenance personnel are not trained, nor equipped, to accomplish crash-rescue func-
   tions. Crash-rescue is the responsibility of the 4 CES, Fire Protection Flight.
   5.17. The 4 EMS Crash Recovery Section is specifically trained to recover F-15E aircraft and assist
   the 916th ARW with the recovery of KC-135 aircraft. (Agreement#FB4809-99-009)

       5.18.1. The On Scene Commander (OSC), 4 MSG/CC, will determine the number of personnel
       required at the time of an operation and keeps the Safety Investigation Board President (SIBP)
       informed of the recovery.
       5.18.2. The Crash Recovery Team Chief is the single point for any agency requiring contact with
       crash recovery personnel and responsible for planning/coordination with base agencies, advises
       the OSC of recovery operations.
       5.18.3. The Recovery Team Supervisor will be a qualified 7-level, responsible for crash recovery
       team member task assignments and the physical recovery of the aircraft. The crash recovery team
       supervisor works in conjunction with the Crash Recovery Team Chief.
       5.18.4. Crash Recovery Team Members will be qualified crash-trained technicians, responsible to
       the Crash Recovery Team Chief and Recovery Team Supervisor for the safe recovery of aircraft
