1. General:
     1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary products
     used during the Headquarters Air Combat Command Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit
     Compliance Inspections (UCI) to assess unit compliance with guidance governing each
     particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the ACC staff and based
     upon existing ―by-law‖ requirements, Executive Orders, Department of Defense directives,
     Air Force (AF) and ACC guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or ACC
     leadership to assess and assure unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective
     of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
     1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
     and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
     mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier core and
     general compliance items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. It is the intent of the
     evaluation team to inspect 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected unit as a minimum
     during the UCI. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
     Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
        1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). This is an item or area where unit failure
        to comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life,
        serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
      - Airman development programs
      - Ability to deploy forces
      - Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). This is an item or area that requires special
        vigilance and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed
        "Critical." Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission
        performance or could result in injury or possible litigation. CCIs are shown in ALL
        CAPS FORMAT.
        1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). This is an item or area deemed fundamental to
        successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
        impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
        litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
