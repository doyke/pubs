This manual implements AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures, 14 January 2005. It
contains the basic procedures and techniques that apply to all personnel operating T-6 aircraft
under operational control of Air Education and Training Command (AETC). With the exception
of the associate instructor pilot (IP) programs, this manual does not apply to Air National Guard
or Air Force Reserve Command units or members. While this manual primarily addresses the
student pilot, it provides the general guidelines for all T-6 pilots. It addresses basic flying tasks
and planning considerations and is designed to be used in conjunction with AFI 11-202, Volume
3, General Flight Rules; AFI 112T-6, Volume 1, T-6A Aircrew Training; AFI 11-2T-6, Volume
2, T-6A Aircrew Evaluation Criteria; AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3, T-6 Operations Procedures; and
Technical Order (TO) 1T-6A-1, Flight Manual, USAF/USN Series T-6A Aircraft.

This manual presents a solid foundation on which student training missions can be accomplished
and instructor continuation training maintained. Use safety considerations as a guide in
determining the best course of action for situations not specifically covered by this publication.

HQ AETC/A3 is the waiver authority for this manual. Submit waiver requests in message or
memorandum format, through standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels to HQ
AETC/A3FV. The operations group commander is the waiver authority for subordinate unit

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Chapter 1
addresses applicability of joker fuels; changes an intercom failure process from technique to
procedural; and moves G awareness and associated information to the beginning of Chapter 6.
Chapter 2 adds verbiage introducing the concept of ―trading altitude for airspeed.‖ Chapter 3
includes procedural clarification on conducting a brake check during taxi, and specification on
conducting "before leaving aircraft" checklist items. Chapter 4 includes emphasis on ensuring
nosewheel is centered prior to beginning takeoff roll; adds verbiage for 60 knot torque check;
and clarifies climb speeds for an intermediate climb and level-off. Chapter 5 adds emphasis to fly
appropriate knots indicated air speed (KIAS) or on-speed angle of attack (AOA); reflects minor
adjustments to target torque settings; consolidates information on crosswind landings; adds
power as required for all go-arounds, except for the landing phase; extensively reorganizes
emergency landing pattern (ELP) information; emphasizes that operational risk management
(ORM) 3-2-1 is directly applicable only to actual engine failures; consolidates information on
slips; redefines low key position; adds text for break-to-low-key, closed-to-low-key and zero-
torque ELP training; reflects the move of G awareness and associated information from Chapter
1 to Chapter 6; includes a redesigned figure 6.1; emphasizes using visual cues during power on
stall recoveries; consolidates information on secondary stalls; adjusts break stall recovery
procedure; deletes the requirement for a specific pitch trim setting during out-of-control-flight
(OCF) training; specifies the power setting requirement for nose-high recoveries; makes minor
adjustments to altitudes required and the entry for a barrel roll; and modifies power setting for
the cloverleaf. Chapter 7 includes minor adjustments to penetration and enroute descent pitch
and power settings; adds emphasis to initially establishing required descent gradient on a
penetration approach; adjusts the required power setting for confidence maneuvers; renames and
significantly alters spatial disorientation demonstrations to align terminology with joint primary
pilot training (JPPT) academic text; standardizes instrument takeoff pitch with technical order
procedures; reorganizes course intercept information; and reorganizes information on commonly
used memory aids. Chapter 8 deletes information on carrying sunshades, and adds text for
computing an emergency route abort altitude (ERAA) on low-level routes. Chapter 9 clarifies the
terms ―1,‖ ―2,‖ and "flight lead;" removes references to three- and four-ship formations;
consolidates lost sight, breakouts and lost wingman information; consolidates lead change
information; abbreviates information in maneuvering fundamentals; clarifies procedures to re-
form from fighting wing; deletes range and aspect, lead/lag, and pure pursuit exercises; clarifies
the power setting for extended trail (ET) level 1; adds verbiage for tactical initial; and
incorporates fluid maneuvering and two-ship low-level navigation instructions (80th Flying
Training Wing only). Chapter 10 changes pitch reference for final turns at night. Chapter 11
incorporates four references originally in Chapter 9.

                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General:
   1.1.1. This manual provides the necessary procedures to employ the T-6 safely and
   effectively. It provides the basis for development of the necessary physical skills and mental
   aptitude required to fly the aircraft. The skills developed in the T-6 are applicable to flying
   any military aircraft and provide the foundation for all follow-on flying training.
   1.1.2. TO 1T-6A-1 contains detailed instructions for inspections, checks, and procedures. It
   also provides detailed information on aircraft systems and systems operation. The TO and
   this publication complement each other.
1.2. Using This Manual. In general, this manual is organized in an order that parallels the
training flow in pilot training. The first five chapters cover topics applicable to every sortie, and
the second five chapters cover topics by category of flight. While each chapter builds on skills
and concepts introduced in previous chapters, the initial phase of training requires mastery of all
concepts and skills introduced in chapters 1 through 6. During subsequent stages of training,
study centers on specific category chapters. Regular review of previous material is required.
1.3. Introduction. The concepts in Chapter 1 apply to every kind of sortie flown in the T-6, and
many are universally applicable to flight in every type of military aircraft. Full understanding of
these general concepts is developed through study and flying experience; therefore, regular
review of this chapter is required.
1.4. Safety. Safety is a critical component of successful mission accomplishment on every
sortie. The safety mindset of each crewmember is a key part in the overall safety of any flying
operation. Each individual is responsible for minimizing risk to the people and assets under his
or her control and identifying potential safety hazards.
   1.4.1. Ground Safety. The flight line is an extremely busy environment. Moving aircraft,
   support equipment, and emergency vehicles create a hazardous environment. Extra diligence
   is required to prevent a tragic event.
       1.4.1.1. Stay clear of the aircraft danger areas as depicted in TO 1T-6A-1, Section 2
       (prop areas and the jet exhaust of running aircraft).
       1.4.1.2. Secure loose items prior to entering the flight line to prevent foreign object
       damage (FOD).
       1.4.1.3. Maintain constant watch for moving vehicles.
   1.4.2. Flying Safety. Once airborne, safety assumes a more dynamic character. For
   example, a converging aircraft may unexpectedly appear, or a malfunction can cause
   distractions during a critical phase of flight. Safe operation requires an aggressive disposition
   toward gaining and maintaining situational awareness (SA). According to AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, SA is an ―aircrew member‘s
   continuous perception of self and aircraft in relation to the dynamic environment of flight,
 16                                                           AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   threats, and mission, and the ability to forecast, then execute, tasks based upon that
   perception.‖ Methods to maintain SA include:
       1.4.2.1. Clearing the airspace.
       1.4.2.2. Monitoring aircraft systems.
       1.4.2.3. Establishing and maintaining an emergency recovery plan before an emergency
       occurs.
1.5. Flight Discipline. Flight discipline is at the core of every flying operation. Maintaining the
highest standards of integrity, professional military pilots must adhere to the spirit and intent of
governing guidelines while executing the mission in the presence of temptation to do otherwise.
   1.5.1. Flight discipline begins with mission preparation. Know the rules and procedures,
   study the profile, ensure crew rest requirements are met, and show up prepared to fly. One
   unprepared crewmember can jeopardize the mission.
   1.5.2. Flight discipline continues with the briefing. Be on time, be ready to discuss the
   mission, and be ready to brief. Ensure all questions are answered and mission requirements
   are understood.
   1.5.3. Flight discipline is demonstrated in the air by executing the mission as briefed
   according to governing guidelines, from engine start to engine shutdown.
   1.5.4. Flight discipline should be evaluated and specifically addressed during every mission
   debrief.
1.6. Checklist Discipline. TO 1T-6A-1CL, The Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist, is a
condensed version of TO 1T-6A-1. The omission of a checklist item could lead to a dangerous
situation. Therefore, positively confirm completion of all checklists regardless of how they are
accomplished (memory aid, mnemonic, approved unit-developed checklist [UDC], or flight crew
checklist). One technique to ensure accomplishment of every step is to execute a few items from
memory; then reference the checklist page to verify completion. Further guidance on checklist
use follows:
   1.6.1. UDCs may be published to further condense many of the checklists used during
   ground and flight operations. UDCs often include multiple checklists on a single sheet that
   can be conveniently referenced without having to manipulate the flight crew checklist. UDCs
   are commonly color coded for easy identification of steps that need to be highlighted for easy
   reference.
   1.6.2. It is not necessary to refer to the checklist during critical phases of flight.
   1.6.3. There will be only one pilot actively controlling the aircraft at any point in time. This
   pilot is referred to in the rest of this manual as the pilot flying (PF). The PF is responsible for
   completion of all checklists.
   1.6.4. Checklist items marked ―(BOTH)‖ must be completed in both the front cockpit (FCP)
   and rear cockpit (RCP). The PF will initiate a ―(BOTH)‖ checklist item by challenging the
   pilot not flying (PNF). A ―(BOTH)‖ item is not complete until a proper response is received
   from the PNF. The use of this method of accomplishment is why ―(BOTH)‖ items are often
   referred to as ―challenge and response‖ items.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                          17


   1.6.5. Once started, attempt to complete checklists without interruption. If interrupted, or if it
   is discovered that an item was omitted, good techniques to get back on track include
   restarting at the first step of the checklist or restarting two to three steps prior to the missed or
   interrupted checklist step. Do not start a new checklist until completing the previous one.
   1.6.6. Throughout your flying career, many checklists and required items are memorized
   through mnemonics or standardized phrases. The purposes of these are to help you remember
   what needs to be done at a specific time. One caution is that you do not give lip service to
   performing a checklist when using a standardized phrase or mnemonic. You must perform
   the checklist item or required check.
1.7. Single-Engine Mentality. The T-6 engine has an excellent record of reliability, but the
potential for engine loss deserves special consideration. Two options exist for engine failure:
ejection or recovery to a suitable airfield. Emergency landing pattern (ELP) practice increases
the chances of successful recovery; however, the aircraft is fitted with a highly capable and
proven ejection seat that should be used if there is any doubt about safe recovery. Special single-
engine considerations include:
   1.7.1. Maintain extra vigilance and a conservative response to unusual engine indications.
   With unusual engine indications, recover to a suitable airfield.
   1.7.2. Maintain awareness of nearest suitable emergency airfields during all phases of flight.
   1.7.3. Do not shut down the engine in flight if it is producing useable thrust unless it is
   confirmed to be on fire or is vibrating excessively with indications of impending failure.
   1.7.4. Set a minimum ejection altitude when immediate ejection is not warranted. This
   altitude is based on energy level (altitude and airspeed), configuration, and position relative
   to a suitable emergency airfield.
   1.7.5. Determine if engine restarts should be attempted. Consider the time delay and altitude
   lost between restart initiation and usable torque, the risk of fire, the presence of FOD and
   whether or not the engine is seized. (Often referred to as ―fire, FOD, or frozen‖.)
1.8. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM):
   1.8.1. The following topics are covered in detail in AFI 11-290; however, a simplified
   explanation of the concepts is sufficient for the early stages of flying training. The CRM
   program is designed to develop aircrew skills in recognizing and responding to the conditions
   that lead to aircrew error. While flying, CRM is the effective use of all available resources to
   safely and efficiently accomplish mission objectives. CRM centers on the following six
   skills:
       1.8.1.1. Situational Awareness (SA). SA is the continuous perception of self and
       aircraft in relation to the dynamic environment of flight, threats, and mission. It also
       includes the ability to forecast, then execute tasks based upon that perception.
       1.8.1.2. Flight Integrity and Wingman Consideration. Flight integrity requires the
       utilization of all members of a flight to accomplish the mission. Wingman consideration
       requires flight members to recognize each other‘s limitations and plan or act accordingly.
       1.8.1.3. Task Management. Task management is the ability to establish priorities and
       alter a course of action based on new information. It includes management of automation,
 18                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       effective use of available resources, checklist discipline, and compliance with standard
       operating procedures.
       1.8.1.4. Communication. Communication is the sharing of information with others to
       cause action. Communications may direct, inform, question, or persuade.
       1.8.1.5. Risk Management or Decision Making. Logic-based, common sense approach
       to decision making is based on human, material, and environmental factors. The goal is to
       match risk to the mission, not completely eliminate risk.
       1.8.1.6. Mission Planning, Briefing, and Debriefing. Includes pre-mission analysis
       and planning, briefing, and post mission debrief.
   1.8.2. CRM is designed to focus aircrew members on agencies, procedures, and resources
   available to enable mission success. To do this, locally developed CRM checklists describe
   behaviors to reinforce and others to avoid. A CRM topic will be included in the mission
   brief; it should be tailored to specific mission requirements or conditions; and it will be
   evaluated during the debrief.
1.9. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Flying has inherent risks. ORM is the process
used to identify and reduce the risks of flying to an acceptable level. Locally developed ORM
processes balance training benefit and risk. Risk can often be minimized by mission changes that
do not negatively impact training. Typical ORM assessments include analysis in the following
general categories:
   1.9.1. Environmental conditions (weather [WX], bird status, or index of thermal stress, etc.).
   1.9.2. Mission profile (formation, visual flight rules [VFR], low level, use of uncontrolled
   airfields, etc.).
   1.9.3. Pilot factors (experience level, fatigue, currency, etc.).
1.10. Mission Preparation. Mission success is directly related to mission preparation. Flying
time is limited and solid preparation maximizes the effectiveness of limited airborne time.
Mission preparation consists of the following four areas:
   1.10.1. General Study. Study in general areas builds a foundation of knowledge for pilot
   training, other formal training courses, and operational missions. Some topics such as the
   flight manual are aircraft specific and other topics such as local area procedures are location
   specific. Areas of study including instrument rules and procedures (AFMAN 11-217,
   Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures; AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3, Supplemental Flight
   Information; and AFI 11-202, Volume 3), WX, aerodynamics, flight information
   publications (FLIP), and navigation, are generic because they apply to any aircraft, at any
   location, flying any type of mission. General study is a continuous process that is an integral
   part of a successful career in military aviation.
   1.10.2. Mission Selection. Preparation can be focused only after a specific mission is
   identified. In formal training courses, a syllabus normally determines missions. However, in
   many cases, syllabi provide a basic framework, and missions are tailored to individual
   training needs and requirements by reviewing the student grade book or training folder. In
   the formal pilot training environment, mission selection consists of objective setting and then
   profile selection. Objectives focus training to specific areas that must be accomplished to
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       19


  make the mission successful. The profile is the exact list of maneuvers performed on a
  particular sortie. Consider the following when setting objectives:
     1.10.2.1. The overall mission objective should give the big picture. What must occur for
     the sortie to be successful? These objectives are usually pulled from the syllabus in a
     formal training course.
     1.10.2.2. Training objectives are specific and help determine success in relation to the
     syllabus, course training standards, continuation training requirements, etc. A valid
     objective is realistic, achievable, and measurable.
  1.10.3. Mission-Specific Study. Study in areas specifically related to the mission. This
  includes general study areas that are specifically related to the mission (e.g., AFMAN 11-
  217, Volume 1, before an instrument training sortie). Mission-specific areas include, but are
  not limited to, operational restrictions (for type of sortie), initial approach plate (IAP) review,
  local area procedures (for that sortie), maneuver review, and daily study topics (such as
  emergency procedure [EP] of the day). Specific study also includes chair flying. This is an
  in-depth, mental review of the sortie. It is visualization of specific maneuvers and techniques,
  and mental review of checklists and specific tasks. Review individual maneuvers, in
  appropriate sections of the flight manual and this manual, before each sortie. Study should
  focus on the primary mission, but some time must be devoted to possible alternate missions.
  1.10.4. Mission Planning. The previous facets of mission preparation generally prepare the
  pilot for the mission, but there are tasks that must be accomplished to execute the specific
  mission on a specific day. Mission planning includes all the tasks that turn the plan into
  reality. The following list includes many of the mission planning steps:
     1.10.4.1. Check notices to Airmen (NOTAM), WX, and operations (ops) notes.
     1.10.4.2. Sign off go/no-go (items that must be accomplished before flying).
         1.10.4.2.1. Review flight crew information file.
         1.10.4.2.2. Review squadron or pilot read files.
     1.10.4.3. Attend mass brief (some formal programs brief the entire class before
     individual mission briefings occur).
     1.10.4.4. Check aircraft sign out data, local profile, call sign, etc.
     1.10.4.5. Schedule or reserve airspace (limited special use airspace, low-level military
     training route [MTR], etc.).
     1.10.4.6. Check bird hazard models.
     1.10.4.7. Call destination if flying to an airfield other than the home airfield.
     1.10.4.8. Review local restrictions (ramp freeze, construction, etc.).
     1.10.4.9. Prepare briefing (briefing board, EP of the day, etc.).
     1.10.4.10. Compute takeoff and landing data (TOLD).
     1.10.4.11. Compute or check weight and balance.
     1.10.4.12. Plan fuel, select route, file a flight plan.
 20                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


1.11. Fuel Considerations. Unlike many operational and training aircraft, the T-6 is not fuel
limited on most training sorties. Generally, syllabus directives, not available fuel, determine the
duration of most sorties; however, regular fuel checks are still required and are an important part
of each mission.
   1.11.1. Bingo, joker, and normal recovery fuels are defined in AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3.
   1.11.2. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, defines fuel requirements for all sorties.
   1.11.3. Bingo fuel is briefed on every mission. Joker fuel is briefed and set at preplanned
   transition points in the sortie, if applicable. A mission may require several joker fuels or none
   at all.
   1.11.4. If bingo fuel is reached, recovery should be initiated to arrive at the intended
   destination with required fuel reserves. On most T-6 syllabus training sorties, recovery is
   normally initiated prior to reaching bingo fuel because of sortie duration limitations.
   1.11.5. Mission priorities and flight conditions may change while airborne (e.g., area
   assignment, WX conditions, alternate airfield requirements, etc.). The aircraft commander
   (AC) of a single-ship mission or the flight lead (FL) of a formation may adjust joker or bingo
   fuels during flight to accommodate mission conditions.
1.12. Mission Briefing. The AC or FL may or may not be the actual briefer, but in every case
will ensure that each mission is thoroughly briefed and debriefed.
   1.12.1. Briefings set the tone for all missions. All crewmembers will be on time, prepared,
   and in possession of all required material and information. Complete all preflight
   administrative tasks (such as checking the WX and the NOTAMs) before the briefing.
   1.12.2. As a minimum, locally established briefing guides will cover all required items.
   Discuss formal special interest items during all briefings.
   1.12.3. Other crewmembers or formation members will be prepared to assist the AC or FL.
   1.12.4. The briefing should focus on how to successfully accomplish the established
   objectives.
1.13. Debrief. The purpose of the debrief is to determine if mission objectives were achieved.
From both administrative and tactical perspectives, the AC should:
   1.13.1. Cover what went right or wrong, root causes of errors, and how to improve
   subsequent missions.
   1.13.2. Address all questions, concerns, and address disagreements.
   1.13.3. Debrief by objective, examining how well each objective was achieved.
   1.13.4. Summarize the mission with emphasis on major learning points and considerations
   for improvement of deficient areas on future missions.
1.14. Tandem Seat Challenges. Limited visibility of the crewmember in the other cockpit
makes it difficult to judge intentions, anticipate actions, and verify aircraft systems
configuration. Verbal communication must compensate for the lack of intercockpit visibility.
Most functions are controllable from either cockpit; however, some items can only be
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        21


manipulated or directly checked in the front cockpit. To reduce the potential adverse impact of
tandem seating:
   1.14.1. Know which systems are controlled from the FCP or RCP, and how to monitor
   systems that can only be monitored or controlled from the opposite cockpit through verbal or
   visual coordination:
       1.14.1.1. Activation of the auxiliary battery - FCP.
       1.14.1.2. Manual fuel balance left/right (L/R) switch - FCP.
       1.14.1.3. Environmental control system controls - FCP.
       1.14.1.4. Parking brake position - FCP.
       1.14.1.5. Emergency gear extension - FCP.
       1.14.1.6. Power Management Unit (PMU)- FCP
       1.14.1.7. Interseat sequencing system (ISS) - RCP.
   1.14.2. Know which systems, although controlled from the FCP, can be checked from the
   RCP and how:
       1.14.2.1. Check bleed air inflow by pressing the G-suit test button.
       1.14.2.2. Confirm on board oxygen-generating system (OBOGS) is operating by
       momentarily turning off supply lever.
       1.14.2.3. Confirm defog operation by sound or temperature of the defog outlet valves
       along the canopy rail.
       1.14.2.4. Confirm external light operation (on the ground) by looking for reflections
       from adjacent aircraft or other surfaces.
   1.14.3. Consider FCP pilot landing if RCP visibility is severely compromised.
   1.14.4. Ensure all crewmembers thoroughly understand transfer of aircraft and systems
   control.
1.15. Transfer of Aircraft and Systems Control. Only one pilot at a time can fly the aircraft.
It is vital for flight safety to clearly establish who is the PF and who is the PNF as fatal accidents
have occurred when two pilots attempted to fly the aircraft simultaneously. The PF is responsible
for checklist completion and systems operation; however, the PF may task the PNF to operate
systems. Because of the importance of proper transfer of aircraft control, the following rules
apply:
   1.15.1. Transfer of aircraft control:
       1.15.1.1. The PF relinquishing control says, ―You have the aircraft.‖
       1.15.1.2. The PNF assumes control and says, ―I have the aircraft,‖ and noticeably shakes
       the control stick.
       1.15.1.3. The order may be reversed as the AC always retains the authority to take
       aircraft control when required. The order of transfer is less important than each
       crewmember executing his or her role according to the procedures listed.
 22                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       1.15.1.4. If the AC, as the PNF, says ―I have the aircraft‖ and noticeably shakes the
       control stick, the PF must immediately relinquish control of the aircraft, and say, ―You
       have the aircraft.‖ This is an example of how the order is reversed, but the roles continue
       to be executed.
       1.15.1.5. Using the exact words is critical to establish proper habit patterns that enhance
       swift, unambiguous transfer of aircraft control. Do not use other words such as ―it‖ or
       ―jet‖ in lieu of the term ―aircraft‖ as they can be misunderstood, misheard, and create
       confusion.
   1.15.2. In the event of intercom failure, the PF signals the desire to relinquish aircraft control
   by smoothly pushing the rudder pedals in a back-and-forth motion, and the PNF assumes
   control by vigorously shaking the control stick . The pilot relinquishing control raises both
   hands in the air for the other pilot to see either directly from the RCP or using mirrors from
   the FCP.
   1.15.3. Never relinquish control of the aircraft until the other pilot has positively assumed
   control of the aircraft (shaken the control stick).
   1.15.4. Do not hesitate to relinquish control when directed by the AC.
   1.15.5. Immediately query the other crewmember in case of confusion.
   1.15.6. The tandem seating setup of T-6 systems can be confusing if not managed properly.
   It is crucial to coordinate systems use to avoid inadvertent inputs. Systems that require crew
   coordination include canopy, radio management unit (RMU), global positioning system
   (GPS), and electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) configuration. The PF controls all of
   the systems of the aircraft unless a transfer of that system has been clearly communicated
   between the crewmembers. The PNF should also communicate when transferring control of
   the system back to the PF.
1.16. Clearing. Each crewmember is responsible for collision avoidance - regardless of rank,
experience, or cockpit position - whether instrument flight rules (IFR) or VFR. The three primary
tools for clearing in the T-6 are eyes, radios, and the Naval Aircraft Collision Warning System
(NACWS) or Traffic Advisory System (TAS). In addition, air traffic control (ATC) shares
aircraft separation responsibility with the pilot and provides separation between IFR and
participating VFR aircraft operating in controlled airspace. Pilots have the responsibility to clear
the aircraft in all directions, and although the use of radar monitoring, assigned areas, or ATC
separation can assist in ensuring clearance, it does not relieve pilots of the responsibility. The
following principles apply to clearing regardless of flight conditions:
   1.16.1. Visual detection is the most important factor in clearing for other aircraft. The
   following methods can help the pilot see other aircraft:
       1.16.1.1. Visual Scanning. Search an area with an arc of approximately 20 to 30
       degrees at a time and focus on a distant point (cloud, ground reference, etc.) within the
       arc for 3 to 5 seconds. After cross-checking instruments in the cockpit, it is necessary to
       refocus on a distant point because the eye will naturally focus at a distance of about 18
       inches.
       1.16.1.2. Heading Changes. When on a collision course, another aircraft appears
       stationary in the canopy and is difficult to see. The eye most readily detects line of sight
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        23


       (LOS) motion. Slight heading changes can create the relative movement required for
       detection of the other aircraft. This method is most effective when ATC or NACWS
       provides traffic alerts for aircraft that are not acquired visually.
       1.16.1.3. Wing Flashes. When an aircraft is known to be close but not visually
       acquired, a wing flash or rock can create the necessary movement for detection.
       1.16.1.4. Radios and NACWS or TAS. Position reports and NACWS/TAS range or
       position information can help narrow visual clearing efforts to specific quadrants.
       Prioritize but do not channelize as the accuracy of the information provided can vary
       depending on specific conditions and capabilities. Knowledge of local area traffic can
       also cue crewmembers to the most likely areas of potential conflict.
   1.16.2. If the PNF sees a hazard, point it out to the PF, indicate left or right, a clock position,
   and relationship to the horizon (high, level, or low). For example, ―traffic, right 2 o‘clock
   low, 2 miles, tracking right to left.‖ See Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.3 for canopy
   code references.

Figure 1.3. FCP Canopy Code, Azimuth.




   1.16.3. If time is critical and collision is imminent, the PNF should take control of the
   aircraft and avoid the hazard. Ensure the intended flight path is well clear of other aircraft
   (500 feet minimum).
   1.16.4. Be aware of the restrictions to visibility created by the canopy bows.
 26                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   1.16.5. Use clearing turns when warranted to clear blind spots beneath the aircraft fuselage
   and wings, especially in training areas. Clearing turns can consist of turns that include high
   bank angles or turns of approximately 90 degrees off the established heading.
   1.16.6. Local traffic patterns present the greatest collision potential. To reduce risk, military
   and civilian traffic patterns utilize standard procedures. While visual scans are vital in this
   environment, pattern procedures, including proper radio calls, are the primary means of
   deconfliction. The following can improve clearing in the pattern:
       1.16.6.1. Knowledge of Choke Points in the Pattern. Military: 90-to-initial, VFR
       entry, closed downwind, high-to-low key, and the perch point. Civilian: pattern entry,
       downwind, and final.
       1.16.6.2. Proper Setting of the NACWS or TAS. Selection of a smaller range
       improves usability of NACWS or TAS information in the pattern.
       1.16.6.3. Compliance with Mandatory Radio Transmissions. They serve as position
       reports essential to pattern deconfliction. Likewise, other aircraft‘s radio transmissions
       help visually acquire aircraft in the pattern (commonly referred to as ―clearing on the
       radios‖).
1.17. Radio Procedures. The PF is responsible for all radio calls. The PNF may transmit
without transfer of aircraft control; however, the PF must be notified (see paragraph 1.15.6).
Exception: instructors may immediately correct improper radio calls without first notifying the
student. Radio procedures, definitions, and guidance are contained in the following publications:
AETCI 11-204, Runway Supervisory Unit (RSU) Operations; AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1; FAA
Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM); FLIP, Flight Information Handbook; and individual
wing and (or) squadron instructions. Although these publications do not cover all situations,
pilots should attempt to use standard phraseology as much as practical. Standard terminology
minimizes radio congestion and facilitates effective communication.
   1.17.1. Clarity. The single most important factor in pilot-controller communications is
   comprehension. Voicing what is required correctly through standard phraseology is
   paramount. Use of nonstandard and improvised phrasing, while common, only contributes to
   miscommunication and should be minimized. Nonstandard phraseology contributes to
   misunderstood clearances and aircraft mishaps. When uncertain of the meaning of standard
   phrases used by controlling agencies, clarify with plain language.
   1.17.2. Brevity. Brevity is second only to clarity. Every second you are talking on the radio
   is a second that is unavailable to the controllers or other pilots. Provide controllers with the
   information needed, nothing more, nothing less, in the format expected. Likewise, do not
   omit needed information that may require the controller to query you for the missing
   information, as this also wastes air time.
       1.17.2.1. Do not depress the microphone button during other transmissions. Anticipate
       other party‘s replies to ATC and pilot transmissions and do not interrupt. Try to avoid
       transmitting when another aircraft is in a critical phase of flight (e.g., in the flare).
       1.17.2.2. Whenever possible, format radio calls as follows: agency calling, call sign,
       location, and request. Example: “San Antonio Approach, Texan 10, Area 8 low, request
       Auger ILS with bravo.”
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      27


       1.17.2.3. Adding verbiage that is not required clutters the radio frequency. Avoid
       meaningless phrases such as ―with you,‖ ―checking in,‖ ―with a flash,‖ ―at this time,‖ ―be
       advised,‖ on congested frequencies. Provide the controllers with the information needed
       simply and clearly in the format expected. Nonstandard radio calls take more time to
       understand.
       1.17.2.4. Include all required information in calls to ATC to prevent the requirement for
       additional ATC queries. When making a detailed request, however, avoid confusion and
       frequency congestion by first getting the controller‘s attention (“Del Rio Approach,
       Texan 10, request”). After the controller acknowledges, state the request.
1.18. GPS Usage. GPS usage is introduced early in primary training. It is used in conjunction
with very high frequency omnidirectional range station (VOR) and distance measuring
equipment (DME) information in a building block approach to navigation and area orientation.
Using the GPS can offer a simple solution to area orientation and navigation in the early stages
of training, allowing the focus to be on learning to fly an Air Force aircraft.
1.19. Emergency Procedures. Three basic rules apply to all emergency procedures: (1)
maintain aircraft control, (2) analyze the situation and take proper action, and (3) land as soon as
conditions permit. If the aircraft cannot be recovered safely, ejection may be the only option.
   1.19.1. Maintain Aircraft Control . In any abnormal or emergency situation it is
   imperative to fly the aircraft first! The PF flies the aircraft until the AC directs otherwise.
   Maintain an aircraft attitude that allows for an appropriate response to the emergency
   situation. Set power and trim to help maintain control. Aircraft control may include the initial
   turn and climb to a recovery airfield. In the contact phase, this may involve a contact
   recovery or out-of-control flight (OCF) recovery. In low-level navigation, it may involve
   starting a climb to the top of the route. In formation, it may involve calling knock it off (KIO)
   and taking the number 1 position. A memory aid to help prioritize pilot action that is
   applicable in normal and emergency situations is ―Aviate, Navigate, Communicate.‖
   1.19.2. Analyze the Situation and Take Proper Action. Indications of a problem include
   aircraft performance, engine instrument readings, or the cockpit warning system (CWS). If
   dual, confirm suspect indications with the other crewmember. If the master warning/master
   caution light is illuminated, look at the panel before resetting the system by pushing the light
   to turn it off. Consider all indications when diagnosing the problem. Proper actions are
   dependent on the correct analysis and careful consideration of the circumstances. In many
   cases, the proper actions are clear, however, alternate courses of action may exist depending
   on the nature of the emergency, flight conditions, and pilot proficiency. Pilot actions may
   include:
       1.19.2.1. Critical Actions. Boldface procedures are committed to memory and must be
       performed immediately to prevent aggravation of the emergency. Sufficient time may not
       exist to reference the checklist. After critical steps are performed, the checklist is
       referenced for noncritical cleanup steps. Additional noncritical checklists may be
       required for successful recovery.
       1.19.2.2. Noncritical Actions. These checklist steps contribute to an orderly sequence
       of events and improve the chances for successful recovery. Warnings, cautions, and notes
       in the checklist must also be reviewed during checklist execution.

     1.19.2.3. Communication with the Supervisor of Flying (SOF), Top-3 or Operations
     Supervisor, or RSU Crew. These experts can read checklists, reference the flight
     manual, contact the aircraft manufacturer, check calculations, identify potential chase
     ships (airborne aircraft than can rejoin on a distressed aircraft to help with analysis and
     recovery), or offer advice on course of action and recovery plans.
     1.19.2.4. Communication with ATC. ATC can help identify suitable recovery airfields,
     find required frequencies, aid navigation with vectors, alert emergency response assets,
     identify hazardous WX, or help find a chase ship.
     1.19.2.5. Evaluation of Possible Recovery Airfields. The initial airfield selected may
     not always be the best. Changes to energy state (if torque deficient) may eliminate or
     expand airfield options. Additional research, once initial actions are complete, may
     identify a better option (based on WX, runway [RWY] available, emergency response
     available, etc.).
     1.19.2.6. Request for Chase Ship. Chase ships can be a tremendous asset during
     emergency situations. They can lead aircraft with instrument malfunctions through WX,
     provide assistance similar to ground-based experts, clear for task saturated emergency
     aircraft, or handle communications with ATC. See AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3 for chase ship
     restrictions.
     1.19.2.7. Review of Approach/Landing and Post-Landing Actions with Other
     Crewmember or Ground-Based Agencies. Crew coordination is essential for
     successful recovery and incident-free emergency termination. Clear communication with
     ground-based agencies is necessary to coordinate contingencies such as possible RWY
     closure.
  1.19.3. Flight Manual Landing Recommendations:
     1.19.3.1. Land as soon as possible. A landing should be accomplished at the nearest
     suitable landing area considering severity of emergency, WX conditions, field facilities,
     ambient lighting, and command guidance. The TO-1T-6-1 dictates that an emergency
     will be declared.
     1.19.3.2. Land as soon as conditions permit (determined by nature of emergency and
     sound judgment).
     1.19.3.3. Land as soon as practical. Emergency conditions are less urgent. The mission
     should be terminated; however, the degree of emergency is such that an immediate
     landing may not be necessary.
  1.19.4. CRM in an Emergency. A successful conclusion to any emergency results from
  thorough systems knowledge, sound judgment, and effective CRM. Several resources are
  available to aid successful recovery.
     1.19.4.1. Inside the Cockpit. The AC determines who flies the aircraft, based on pilot
     workload and the experience level and ability of both pilots. The PNF can read the
     checklist, monitor systems, provide advice, and maintain SA on the nearest suitable
     landing field. The flight crew checklist, in-flight guide, flight information handbook, or
     other FLIP can contain useful information.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    29


      1.19.4.2. Outside the Cockpit. Outside help can be essential whether dual or solo
      during an emergency. ATC agencies can alert emergency services and provide traffic
      priority. The SOF, Top-3 or operations supervisor, or RSU crew can provide assistance
      with checklists, recommend courses of action, and monitor the situation. A chase ship can
      provide inspection of aircraft areas that cannot be seen from either cockpit.
   1.19.5. Ejection. If abandoning the aircraft becomes necessary, the AC will use the
   command ―BAILOUT, BAILOUT, BAILOUT!‖ as the final directive. If time and conditions
   permit, discuss and accomplish ejection procedures with the other crewmember, using the
   term ―ejection‖ rather than ―bailout.‖ In critical situations, do not delay an ejection waiting
   for the ―BAILOUT‖ command, and do not delay an ejection once the command is given.
1.20. Tabletop and Standup EPs:
   1.20.1. The purpose of tabletop EPs is to expose student pilots to as many different
   emergency situations as possible on the ground before they are faced with actually handling
   one while airborne. Standup EPs provide the same exposure; however, they have the added
   pressure of performing while people are watching over your decisions. This added pressure
   simulates the stress of an actual airborne emergency.
   1.20.2. The objective of tabletop and standup EPs is to exercise your knowledge and
   available resources to formulate and execute a plan to get you safely on the ground. All the
   same principles outlined in paragraph 1.20 apply to these practice situations.
   1.20.3. Although there can be many techniques used to solve most problems, the use of the
   mnemonic A-A-B-C-D-E-F (Figure 1.4) will help put the basic EP principles into logical
   steps.
      1.20.3.1. A—Aircraft Control. Maintaining aircraft control dictates that you continue
      to fly the aircraft and get to a stable flight condition that allows you time to analyze the
      situation. In the contact phase, this may involve a contact recovery or OCF recovery. In
      low-level navigation, it may involve starting a climb to the top of the route. In formation,
      it may involve calling KIO and taking the number 1 position. During this step, describe
      how you will use the control stick, rudder, and power control lever (PCL) to achieve a
      stabilized flight condition.
      1.20.3.2. A—Analyze the Situation:
          1.20.3.2.1. During this phase of the practice situation, time stands still because your
          eyes and brain work a lot faster in the aircraft than you can talk when asking
          questions about the status of different systems on the aircraft. At this point in time,
          ask your IP questions about the aircraft.
          1.20.3.2.2. Acronyms can help you analyze the situation. Common is a FEVER
          check for engine problems:
              1.20.3.2.2.1. F stands for fluctuating fuel flow. A properly working engine at a
              constant PCL setting should not have fuel flow jumping around more than 10
              pounds per hour (pph).
              1.20.3.2.2.2. E stands for excessive interstage-turbine temperature (ITT). The
              PMU, if still online, should limit the ITT in range; if not, you have a problem.
30                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


            1.20.3.2.2.3. V stands for visual signals. Smoke, flames, and oil on the
            windscreen are symptoms of engine problems.
            1.20.3.2.2.4. E stands for erratic engine operations.
            1.20.3.2.2.5. R stands for roughness. An engine making strange noises also
            indicates problems.
        1.20.3.2.3. If at any time during the analyze the situation step you realize there may
        be an engine problem, perform the first four steps of the precautionary emergency
        landing (PEL) checklist (turn, climb, clean, check). Once pointed toward the nearest
        suitable airfield, get the aircraft on an ELP profile, and continue to analyze the
        situation for impending engine failure.
        1.20.3.2.4. Other things to analyze during this step include, but are not limited to,
        avionics, lights and tones, circuit breakers, and outside aircraft structure (possibly via
        a chase ship). As the analysis continues, do not spend more time than necessary just
        to stall for time. If you think you know what is wrong with the aircraft, go with it.
        Remember, even though time stands still in the flight room, it does not in the aircraft.
     1.20.3.3. B—Boldface. Once you have analyzed the situation, time resumes, and it is
     time to take the proper action and perform any boldface required. During this step, state
     the boldface steps then verbally execute them. (Example: If the boldface is "Green ring –
     pull [as required]," you will say, ―I will perform this step by pulling the green ring on the
     ejection seat with my left hand.‖) Applying a boldface procedure should require you to
     do something with the aircraft. The engine failure during flight boldface will require you
     to trim the aircraft to 125 knots; the abort boldface will require you to use rudder to keep
     the aircraft near the centerline, etc. Once the boldface is complete, ensure the aircraft is
     still under control and analyze your action. Did the boldface do what it was intended to
     do? (Perform another FEVER check.) Is the fire out? Do you feel pressure in your mask
     from the oxygen bottle? After you have analyzed the situation, ask yourself if there is
     another boldface that applies. Engine failure during flight may lead to immediate engine
     start. Continue in this loop until no other boldface applies.
     1.20.3.4. C—Cleanup Items and Checklists. During this step, you will perform the
     cleanup items (the non-boldface steps) on the boldface checklists and accomplish other
     non-boldface checklists that may apply. Once you apply a checklist, refer back to aircraft
     control. Verbalize how you will use control surfaces to compensate for changes made to
     power settings. Continue to loop through the above steps until no more checklists are
     required. After all the flight manual EP checklists are performed, use the in-flight guide
     to help determine any other pertinent data required to recover the aircraft (such as local
     no radio [NORDO] procedures).
     1.20.3.5. D—Declare, With a Plan. Once you establish your game plan, let the
     appropriate authorities know what is wrong and what you plan to do. When you talk to
     ATC, the SOF or RSU crew, make sure you can tell them the nature of the emergency,
     fuel remaining (expressed in hours and minutes), souls on board, and your plan of action
     to include your estimated time until landing. Know what you are going to do in terms of
     pattern type (straight-in, ELP, overhead, instrument approach) and how you are going to
     stop the aircraft (stop on the RWY and emergency ground egress, stop on a taxiway, or
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    31


      taxi back to parking). Be knowledgeable enough that you have most of the answers
      before the question is asked.
      1.20.3.6. E—Egress/Ejection. Review emergency ground egress and controlled
      ejection checklists. Determine when you will eject if the situation deteriorates and leads
      to an ejection scenario.
      1.20.3.7. F—Follow the Plan. This part of the tabletop or standup EP (land as soon as
      conditions permit) is where you continue to chair fly the emergency to a safe landing. In
      real life, this is where you execute your plan to get safely back to the flight room. During
      a tabletop or standup EP, talk your IP through all the steps—descent check, arrival and
      pattern procedures—and safely exit the airplane.

                                            Chapter 2

                              BASIC T-6 FLIGHT PRINCIPLES

2.1. Introduction. This chapter discusses basic terms that apply to all aircraft. It explains
concepts and terms associated with the T-6 as a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft.
Knowledge and understanding of these terms and their associated aerodynamic effects is
essential to successfully fly the T-6.
2.2. Control Effects. Each flight control affects the attitude of the aircraft by controlling
movement about one of three axes (Figure 2.1). Control movements result in the same
predictable aircraft responses regardless of the attitude of the aircraft. The pilot is the
approximate pivot point about which all changes of attitude occur.

Figure 2.1. Control Axes.




2.3. Use of Controls. When a control surface is moved out of its streamlined position, air
flowing past it exerts pressure against the control surface and tries to return it to neutral. These
air forces on control surfaces are felt on the control stick and rudder pedals. Control forces are
directly proportional to airspeed and control deflection, and provide feedback to the pilot. This
feedback, which is felt in terms of forces felt on the control stick and rudder pedals, identifies
trim requirements. Air forces can impede positioning of the controls to the desired position.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        33


     2.3.1. How to Use the Rudder. When properly positioned, the heels of the feet rest upon
     the cockpit floor and the balls of the feet touch the rudder pedals, allowing full application of
     rudder. Rudder application should be smooth and commensurate with applications of power
     and or bank to maintain a consistent nose track. In order to optimize control feel, maintain
     firm but relaxed pressure on the rudder pedals.
     2.3.2. How to Use the Brakes. The feet need to be repositioned from heels on the cockpit
     floor to balls of the feet on the top of the rudder pedals. Smoothly press on the top of the
     rudder pedals with a rate similar to how you would generally apply the brakes in an
     automobile.
     2.3.3. How to Use the Control Stick. Although many maneuvers generate heavy control
     stick forces, a firm but light touch on the control stick optimizes control feel. Hands and arms
     should remain relaxed. Ideally, during cruise operations fingertips on the control stick are all
     that should be needed. Fingertips give the best feedback on minute changes of aircraft trim.
     2.3.4. How to Use the PCL:
        2.3.4.1. Known power settings provide a useful starting point for PCL position. Starting
        with power settings close to the desired setting minimizes torque and propeller effects.
        General power settings are listed in Table 2.1. These pitch and power settings are
        approximate, and vary from aircraft to aircraft based on factors such as aircraft weight,
        pressure altitude, and temperature.

      2.3.4.2. The PCL requires relatively little travel to change the power. A small movement
      of the PCL can result in a larger than desired power change. Because torque is computer
      controlled, the torque may change slightly after the PCL is set.
      2.3.4.3. Proper hand placement on the PCL is critical to safe operations. Place the palm
      of the hand on the PCL. Never place your wrist on the PCL. Several instances of
      improper hand placement led to contact with the finger lift, retarding the power to idle,
      causing an inadvertent engine shutdown.
   2.3.5. Other Devices. Other devices controlled by the pilot that also affect aircraft handling
   are the flaps, landing gear, and speed brake. However, their effects, for the purposes of
   general aircraft handling, are incidental. Trim sufficiently compensates for minor
   aerodynamic effects of these systems.
2.4. Trim:
   2.4.1. There are many factors in various conditions of flight that affect the forces felt in the
   controls. Trim is needed to compensate for these control stick forces to prevent fatigue,
   increase smoothness, and enable multitasking. When properly trimmed, an aircraft can and
   should be flown with just the fingertips on the control stick to allow slight out-of-trim
   conditions to be easily felt.
   2.4.2. Trim tabs are small movable surfaces attached to the primary flight control surfaces
   (rudder and elevator) that act as levers to equalize pressure exerted on either side of the
   parent control surface. To equalize pressure, the rudder and elevator tabs move in the
   opposite direction from the parent control (Figure 2.2). The amount of trim tab displacement
   determines the magnitude of the parent surface deflection. When trimming the ailerons the
   entire control surface is moved to equalize the pressure.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                          35


Figure 2.2. Trim Tab Locations.




       2.4.2.1. Trimming is a continuous process. When pressure on the controls is relieved and
       aircraft attitude is maintained, the aircraft is correctly trimmed. In the T-6, subtle power
       changes normally do not require large, immediate changes in control pressure. The need
       for trim, therefore, is evident only gradually as airspeed, power, and pitch change.
       2.4.2.2. Without proper rudder trim, the aircraft flies in a slip or a skid as indicated by
       the turn-and-slip indicator (the ball is deflected while the needle is centered). The
       longitudinal axis of the aircraft is not aligned with the direction the aircraft is traveling. In
       effect, the aircraft is flying sideways through the air (proportional to the deflection of the
       ball). To correct this, first apply rudder to center the ball (while holding the turn needle
       centered) and then relieve pressure using rudder trim.
       2.4.2.3. To correct either fore or aft control stick pressure or to maintain a stabilized
       attitude, use elevator trim.
       2.4.2.4. To correct wing heaviness or rolling tendencies, adjust aileron trim. Note that
       aileron trim tabs are preset by maintenance personnel and do not adjust in flight. The
       aileron trim actually repositions the ailerons.
       2.4.2.5. Trim in the following order: rudder, elevator, and aileron.
       2.4.2.6. The trim aid device (TAD) assists rudder trim to help maintain coordinated flight
       during power and airspeed changes. Using engine torque, altitude, airspeed, and pitch
       rate, the TAD computes a desired rudder trim tab position and applies it to the rudder
       trim tab actuator. During large transients of the four parameters, the TAD will lag the
       desired trim position requiring pilot input to ensure coordinated flight.
2.5. Coordination. No single control movement provides all the control input necessary for a
successful maneuver. The various aircraft controls must be properly orchestrated and smoothly
applied for coordinated flight. Rough, erratic use of any control causes the aircraft to react
accordingly. Apply control pressure smoothly and evenly.
 36                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


2.6. Power and Torque Effects:
   2.6.1. Slipstream Effect (Figure 2.3). The thrust generated by the rotation of the propeller
   induces a phenomenon called corkscrew slipstream effect. Specifically, the rotating prop
   produces a helical (or corkscrew) shaped airstream about the longitudinal axis. This
   slipstream strikes the wing root, fuselage, and tail surfaces with a constant high-energy force
   proportional to power setting and airspeed. The addition of power increases airflow over the
   tail surfaces and makes them more effective at slow speeds. In the T-6, the corkscrew
   slipstream induces a slightly higher angle of attack (AOA) on the left wing root and left tail
   surfaces, and slightly lowers AOA on the right wing root and right tail surfaces. This causes
   the aircraft to yaw to the left when power is increased, and requires right rudder input to
   counter the yaw and maintain coordinated flight. As the power is increased by moving the
   PCL forward with the left hand, the right foot must move forward to counter the yaw that is
   induced to the left. The amount of rudder movement is proportional to the amount and rate of
   PCL movement. The amount and rate of rudder movement can be determined by looking out
   the front of the aircraft and using the rudder to keep the nose from swinging either left (too
   little rudder application) or right (too much rudder application). A power reduction has the
   opposite effect requiring left rudder to maintain coordinated flight.

Figure 2.3. Slipstream Effect.




   2.6.2. P-Factor (Figure 2.4.) P-factor is another effect of the propeller. It is caused by
   AOA being higher on the downward-moving propeller blade than on the upward-moving
   propeller blade. This occurs when the aircraft‘s thrust line is above the free airstream relative
   wind or at low speeds and high AOAs with power on. This moves the aerodynamic center of

   yaw left as AOA or power is increased. This is why increasing right rudder is required to
   maintain coordinated flight as AOA is increased on the aircraft, such as in a pull-up for an
   over-the-top aerobatic maneuver. As the airspeed decreases and the AOA increases, the
   aerodynamic center of the propeller shifts to the right and right rudder is required to keep the
   aircraft in coordinated flight. The opposite is true when the thrust line is below the free
   airstream relative wind. The upward-moving propeller blade then has a higher AOA than the
   downward-moving blade. This moves the aerodynamic center of the propeller to the left of
   the shaft on a clockwise-rotating propeller, causing the aircraft to yaw to the right and
   requires left rudder to maintain coordinated flight. A right yawing situation seldom occurs
   since pushing over to the point of shifting the thrust line below the free airstream relative
   wind is rarely warranted.

   2.6.3. Torque (Figure 2.5.) Torque reaction in a propeller-driven aircraft acts opposite the
   direction of propeller rotation. In the case of the T-6, the aircraft tends to roll to the left as a
   result of torque when power is increased, and the aircraft tends to roll right when power is
   reduced. Rudder and the TAD are the primary means for compensating for engine torque.

   2.6.4. Gyroscopic Effect (Figure 2.6.) Gyroscopic reactions are called gyroscopic
   precession. This occurs when a force is applied to displace a spinning mass such as the
   propeller or, in the case of a spin, the aircraft as a whole. Gyroscopic precession causes an
   applied force to act in a plane 90 degrees from that in which it was applied (it is applied in
   the same direction as the rotation). The effect of gyroscopic precession depends on the rate of
   movement about the pitch or yaw axis. Increased rotation rates tend to increase the effect.
   This explains why a pilot, who abruptly corrects aircraft deviations (pitch, bank, and yaw),
   ends up frustrated with the adverse effects of precession. The relatively large propeller on the
   T-6 and high revolutions per minute (rpm) result in more precession effect than an aircraft
   with a lighter, smaller propeller turning at slower rpm. Typical reactions from a clockwise-
   turning propeller (as viewed from the pilot‘s seat) include:
      2.6.4.1. If the nose is yawed to the left, the nose tends to pitch up.
      2.6.4.2. If the nose is yawed to the right, the nose tends to pitch down.
      2.6.4.3. If the nose is pitched down, a left yaw tends to develop.
      2.6.4.4. If the nose is pitched up, a right yaw tends to develop.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     39

2.7. Composite Flight. Composite flight utilizes outside references, complemented by flight
instruments, to establish and maintain desired flight attitudes.
   2.7.1. Establish and maintain an attitude by positioning the nose and wings of the aircraft in
   relation to the horizon.
   2.7.2. While maintaining this position, use trim to reduce or eliminate control pressures. A
   failure to adequately trim at this point in the cross-check will result in ineffective aircraft
   control. See paragraph 2.4 for a discussion on trim technique.
   2.7.3. Small changes in attitude may not be readily noticed by outside reference to the
   horizon but is indicated by the flight instruments. An over reliance on instrumentation to
   maintain aircraft attitude is a common error in composite flight and results in excessive head-
   down time that impedes ability to observe aircraft and other hazards.
   2.7.4. Time spent looking at specific cues (horizon, flight instruments, etc) varies with flight
   conditions. Use the following basic rules to develop an effective cross-check:
       2.7.4.1. Do not concentrate on one cue.
       2.7.4.2. Clear vigilantly for other aircraft.
       2.7.4.3. Check one parameter, make a correction using outside references (if available),
       and then check another parameter. Repeat this cycle.
       2.7.4.4. A single pitch change can correct a deviation involving both altitude and
       airspeed. For instance, if the aircraft is 100 feet high, and approximately 5 knots slow in
 40                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       the traffic pattern, a minor pitch down should put the airplane close to desired parameters.
       This is often referred to as ―trading altitude for airspeed.‖
       2.7.4.5. In clear flight conditions (horizon clearly discernible), devote approximately 80
       percent to outside references (and clearing) and 20 percent to inside references (flight
       instruments).
2.8. Basic Instrument Flight. As outside references deteriorate, the composite cross-check
evolves into an instrument cross-check. General instrument procedures are found in AFMAN 11-
217, Volume 1, and FLIP. T-6-specific guidance is found in the flight manual and Chapter 7 of
this manual.
2.9. Straight-and-level Flight (Figure 2.7.):
   2.9.1. Figure 2.7 depicts level flight at 200 KIAS (half-ground/half-sky). Straight-and-level
   flight requires familiarity with flight instruments and visual cues.
       2.9.1.1. To fly in level flight, consciously fix reference points on the aircraft in relation
       to the horizon, and compare or cross-check this relationship with the flight instruments.
       In addition to outside references, refer to the electronic attitude director indicator (EADI),
       altimeter, and vertical speed indicator (VSI).
       2.9.1.2. In straight-and-level, unaccelerated flight at 200 knots indicated airspeed
       (KIAS), the level flight visual pitch picture is approximately half-ground/half-sky with
       the wings equidistant from the horizon. At higher airspeeds, hold the nose at a lower
       attitude to maintain level flight; at lower airspeeds, hold the nose at a higher attitude.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     41


Figure 2.7. Straight-and-Level Flight.




       2.9.1.3. Familiarity with the design, location, and purpose of flight instrumentation
       speeds up the composite cross-check and aids in detecting small deviations (while they
       are still small). Good aircraft control is a continuous succession of minor, almost
       imperceptible, corrections to keep the aircraft on the desired flight path.
       2.9.1.4. When straight and level, trim the aircraft in all three axes. A trim change is
       necessary when continuous control stick or rudder pressure is required to maintain the
       desired attitude. Straight-and-level flight requires almost no pressure on the controls if
       the aircraft is properly trimmed and the air is smooth; however, when flying through
       turbulence, the flight attitude may change abruptly.
       2.9.1.5. A properly trimmed aircraft is trimmed for a specific airspeed and power setting.
       It flies at the trimmed airspeed hands off, that is, with little or no force applied to the
       control stick or rudders. Changes to airspeed require additional trim input potentially in
       all three axes but predominantly in elevator and rudder (pitch and yaw) trim. For
       example, if the PCL is retarded to slow from 200 to 120 KIAS in level flight, the nose of
       the aircraft drops to seek 200 KIAS. Back stick pressure is required to maintain level
       flight until nose-up trim relieves the back stick pressure and left rudder will be necessary
       to accommodate for the power decrease. A trimmed aircraft reduces pilot fatigue and
       allows the pilot to devote more attention to task management and development of SA on
       events occurring outside the cockpit. Large changes in airspeed in a short amount of time
 42                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      will require large changes in elevator trim and will require running the trim or holding the
      trim button forward or aft. After heavy forces are trimmed off, fine tune the trim by
      loosening grip on the control stick and note the direction that the nose or wings travel.
      2.9.1.6. Apply trim in the opposite direction to nose or wing movement. For example, if
      the nose drops, apply aft elevator trim. If the aircraft rolls left, first confirm slip indicator
      is centered, then add right rudder trim as necessary for coordinated flight. If the slip
      indicator is centered and the aircraft still rolls left, apply right aileron trim.
   2.9.2. A common error in straight-and-level flight is to apply force to the control stick
   inadvertently because of the weight of the pilot‘s arm. Minimize this by resting the forearm
   on the thigh.
2.10. Turns:
   2.10.1. Turns involve coordination of all three controls: ailerons, rudder, and elevator. A
   shallow turn is a turn of approximately 30 degrees bank or less. A steep turn is a turn of
   approximately 45 to 60 degrees bank or greater.
      2.10.1.1. Prior to turning, clear in the direction of the turn. Simultaneously apply
      pressure to ailerons and the rudder in the direction of the turn. The roll rate is governed
      by the amount and rate of pressure applied. Hold control pressure constant until at the
      desired angle of bank (AOB). Use outside references and the instruments to set bank
      angle.
      2.10.1.2. As bank is introduced, a point on the windscreen directly in front of the pilot
      appears to pivot on the horizon. This is often referred to as the ―bug‖ spot. To maintain
      level flight, the bug spot should remain on or near the horizon throughout the turn. As
      bank increases, increase back pressure to compensate for the loss of vertical lift (and raise
      the bug spot to slightly above the horizon). Dragging the NACWS/TAS antenna, located
      just in front of the windscreen, across or slightly below the horizon (depending on seat
      height) is another T-6 reference commonly used to maintain a level turn. In shallow turns,
      the increase in pitch attitude required is small. As bank increases, the increase in pitch
      required is more pronounced. For steep turns, a power increase is required to maintain
      airspeed.
      2.10.1.3. Just as in straight-and-level flight, outside references can be found in any
      direction. The best outside reference for measuring bank is the angle of the horizon
      across the windscreen. Approaching the desired AOB, return the ailerons and rudder to
      neutral but maintain the increased pitch attitude to maintain constant altitude.
      2.10.1.4. To correct nose-low (or nose-high) attitudes in a steep turn, reduce (or increase)
      the AOB with coordinated aileron and rudder pressure. Simultaneously adjust back
      pressure to raise (or lower) the nose to the desired pitch attitude. After attaining the
      desired attitude, reestablish the desired AOB. Cross-check the VSI to detect nose-low or
      nose-high attitudes.
      2.10.1.5. Rollout from a turn is much the same as the entry except control pressure is
      applied in the opposite direction. Apply aileron and rudder pressure in the direction of the
      rollout (toward the high wing). As bank decreases, release elevator pressure smoothly to
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      43


      maintain altitude. The bug spot should remain on the horizon. With decreasing bank, the
      effects of centrifugal force and loss of vertical lift are reduced.
      2.10.1.6. Because the aircraft normally turns as long as there is bank, start the rollout
      before the desired heading. The aircraft continues to turn during the rollout until the
      wings return to the level position. The steeper the bank, the more lead is required to roll
      out on a desired heading. As a guide, during composite flight use a 10-degree lead point
      for turns with 45 degrees or greater bank. Use a 5-degree lead point for turns with less
      than 45 degrees bank.
   2.10.2. Posture in the aircraft is very important. Do not constantly lean forward, backward,
   or side-to-side because this changes the relative position of aircraft references with respect to
   outside references. With a consistent position in the cockpit, outside references remain the
   same.
   2.10.3. A precision turn consists of a constant AOB and a definite amount of turn. To make a
   precise 90-degree turn, align the aircraft with a road or section line on the ground, and turn
   perpendicular to it. In the absence of a ground reference, pick a point on the horizon directly
   off a wingtip.
   2.10.4. A common error is to treat a steep turn differently from a shallow turn. The
   aerodynamic effects are more pronounced in a steep turn, but ultimately the effects are the
   same as in any turn. The difference between steep turns and shallow turns is the amount of
   back stick pressure and power needed to maintain level flight. Rapid and abrupt control
   inputs often result in excessive back pressure (causing a climb) or insufficient back pressure
   (causing a dive).
2.11. Adverse Yaw:
   2.11.1. Adverse yaw is the tendency of the aircraft to yaw away from direction of aileron
   input. Increased lift on the up-going wing causes more induced drag, which retards forward
   movement of that wing. This results in the nose yawing or turning opposite the direction of
   the roll.
   2.11.2. Adverse yaw is overcome by use of the rudder. As aileron pressure is applied,
   simultaneously apply rudder pressure in the same direction as the desired turn. Use rudder
   pressure as long as the bank is changing. The correct amount of rudder pressure depends on
   the aircraft speed and the amount of aileron deflection. To ensure the proper amount of
   rudder is used, cross-check the turn and slip indicator and attempt to keep the ball centered.
   A common technique is to step on the ball. This means to push on the rudder that is on the
   same side of centerline as the ball so as to put the ball back in the middle of the turn and slip
   indicator. Apply rudder and aileron pressure simultaneously, although the required amount of
   pressure differs depending on the amount of aileron used, airspeed, effect of drag, and design
   of the aircraft. Aileron drag effect is present during recovery from a turn as well as during the
   entry. The rudder must be used in the same direction as aileron control stick pressure to
   counteract adverse yaw in the rollout.
2.12. Coordinated and Uncoordinated Flight:
   2.12.1. In a coordinated level turn (Figure 2.8) with constant bank and airspeed, the flight
   path of the aircraft is a true circle (no wind). Variation in the circular flight path is also
 44                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   caused by uncoordinated control (improperly trimmed rudder), erratic bank, or changes in
   airspeed.
   2.12.2. A skid is caused by insufficient bank angle in relation to the turn rate of the aircraft.
   Excessive bottom rudder (rudder deflection to the inside of the turn) during the turn causes a
   skid. A skid also occurs in level flight if the nose of the aircraft rotates sideways about the
   vertical axis when the wings are held level because of improper rudder input. The result is a
   slow turn caused by the rudder only. The turn-and-slip ball shows a slip by displacing to the
   outside of the turn. Skids are dangerous because of the possibility of inadvertent roll at slow
   airspeeds. The impending stall is known as a skidded turn stall.
   2.12.3. A slip is caused by too much bank angle in relation to the turn rate of the aircraft.
   When in a turn, insufficient bottom rudder pressure in relation to the aileron pressure results
   in a slip. A slip can be induced by holding opposite rudder in a turn. Indication of a slip is
   when the slip indicator ball displaces to the inside of the turn. Slips are used to align the
   aircraft with the RWY for landing during crosswind conditions. Slips are also useful for
   depleting excessive energy by increasing descent rates while maintaining airspeed.

3.1. Introduction. Mastery of ground ops is an important first step toward mastery in the air.
3.2. Preflight Check. Preflight checks start before reaching the aircraft. Survey taxi routes for
potential hazards such as foreign objects, repair work, stray equipment, vehicles, or personnel.
Take note of fueling or other aircraft servicing that may impact preflight checks or engine start.
Inform maintenance of special requirements as soon as possible (e.g., oil requirements for cross-
country, seat tie-up for solo, position in formation, etc.).
   3.2.1. Aircraft Forms. AFTO Forms 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document;

   Documentation Record, are the official log of aircraft operation, servicing, and maintenance.
   Check the forms before any aircraft inspection, other action, or checklist is initiated. Contact
   maintenance to report discrepancies in the forms or for clarification. Do not accept the
   aircraft until the forms are accurate and there is no question regarding the acceptability of the
   aircraft.
   3.2.2. Before Exterior Inspection. After opening the canopy, ensure that both seat pins are
   installed and the ISS is in solo before proceeding with the inspection. Before turning on the
   battery, ensure that cockpit switches are positioned properly and that the prop area is clear.
   Pre-adjust straps and pre-position personal equipment and publications to expedite strap-in.
   Take precautions when pre-positioning or stowing equipment or publications in the cockpit.
       3.2.2.1. To prevent damage, do not place anything on the canopy glass.
       3.2.2.2. Do not stow clothing or miscellaneous personal items in the cockpit. Stow
       personal gear not required to execute the mission in the baggage compartment. Use
       caution when stowing items to prevent interference with the ejection or any other system.
   3.2.3. Exterior Inspection. Commonly referred to as a walkaround, this inspection is a
   critical part of each mission. Maintenance performs detailed inspections, and prepares the
   aircraft for flight; however, the pilot walkaround is a last look before flight.
       3.2.3.1. The walkaround checklist begins behind the left wing and moves about the
       aircraft in a clockwise direction. It is not necessary to refer to the checklist for each item,
       but reference the checklist to ensure all items are completed.
       3.2.3.2. Carefully check for fluid leaks in the wheel well, speed brake, and engine bay
       areas. Fluid along fairing doors, seams, and line couplings may indicate potential leaks.
 46                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       Check the general condition of trim tabs, hinges, and control surfaces; however, do not
       manhandle control surfaces. Ensure that tire condition is acceptable for the planned
       mission. If you are unsure about the condition or operation of any system, check with
       qualified maintenance personnel. The pilot in command has final authority to accept or
       reject an aircraft.
3.3. Seating Position in the Aircraft. Seating position should be the same on every flight.
When sitting comfortably, the upper part of the EADI display should be visible just below the
glare shield. A clenched fist between the top of the helmet and the canopy ensures adequate
clearance for the canopy breaker during ejection. Adjust the rudder pedals to allow full travel of
the rudder and associated wheel brake with the heel raised slightly off the floor. During strap-in,
ensure there is enough length with minimal slack in the leg restraint lines for full rudder
deflection.
3.4. Cockpit Organization. The T-6 cockpit has limited storage space, so good cockpit
organization is essential. Cockpit organization varies by mission and personal preference. In-
flight publications or FLIP should be readily available. It is common practice to organize them in
the order in which they will be used. Large checklists or other items on the left leg may cause
interference with PCL movement or cause inadvertent radio transmissions.
3.5. Interior Inspection. Ensure the prop area is clear before turning the battery on or
starting/motoring the engine. Pre-solo student pilots will verbalize each item in the interior
inspection checklist.
3.6. Engine Start:
   3.6.1. Ensure the canopy fracture system (CFS) pin storage box, located over the left
   shoulder of the pilot in the RCP, is closed and pilots‘ visors are down before closing the
   canopy.
   3.6.2. During engine start, closely monitor ITT, gas generator speed (N1), and the start ready
   light. Occasionally glance outside to detect possible aircraft movement or signals from the
   crew chief.
   3.6.3. If necessary to motor the engine before engine start, inform the crew chief and ensure
   the prop is clear. While all starts are made with the canopy closed and locked, motoring may
   be done with the canopy open.
   3.6.4. Inform the crew chief before activating any system that could endanger ground
   personnel (engine start, speed brake, flaps, etc.). When ground intercom is not used, use
   visual signals, according to AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
   and this manual. The crew chief repeats the signal when it is safe to operate the system.
3.7. OBOGS Check. It is critical to check oxygen connections to ensure system integrity from
the supply to the mask. Don the oxygen mask and check the anti-suffocation valve by ensuring
you can breathe (expect some resistance). Then, verify that the supply lever is on and the
concentration lever is normal. Check the mask seal by selecting EMERGENCY and momentarily
holding your breath. A good mask seal is indicated by a no-flow indication on the regulator
(black).
3.8. Radio Procedures. Monitor Air Terminal Information System (ATIS) before taxi. If
reported conditions are significantly different than forecast, consider using actual conditions to
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     47


recompute TOLD. Include ATIS identifier in taxi call, “Texan 11, taxi with Charlie.” Listen
carefully to taxi instructions. Read back the ATC clearance as required locally. In general, read
back instructions if they appear to be different than standard or appear unusual.
3.9. Taxi:
   3.9.1. When the before-taxi checklist is complete, clear to the front and rear. When ready to
   taxi, signal the crew chief with the pull chocks signal, according to AFI 11-218. Before
   leaving the parking area, clear for taxiing aircraft. Use caution for personnel, ground
   equipment, foreign objects, and sun shelters. Select nose wheel steering (NWS), release
   brakes, and increase power as necessary. Follow the marshaller‘s (if available) signals, taxi
   straight ahead, and check the brakes. When parked under sun shelters, slowly pull out from
   the shelter before checking brakes. After a successful brake check, the PF states, ―My brakes
   check, check yours.‖ No formal transfer of aircraft control is required for the brake check.
   Normally, the taxi checklist including NWS, brakes, and heading, turn, or slip indicators is
   completed on the first turn out of parking. Taxi no faster than 5 to 7 knots or a fast walk in
   congested areas, and always be prepared to stop.
   3.9.2. To turn with NWS selected, simultaneously apply rudder in the desired direction and
   reduce power (normally to idle). If a sharper turn is required, deselect NWS (the nose wheel
   will freely caster) and use the inside brake to turn. Apply the brakes smoothly, evenly, and
   cautiously at all times. Differential braking with the NWS engaged could damage the nose
   gear.
   3.9.3. Use power to keep the aircraft rolling at a moderate speed. Once the aircraft is rolling,
   idle power should provide sufficient power. Use the brakes as necessary to control taxi
   speed; however, do not ride the brakes. Normal taxi speed should not exceed 15 knots in
   uncongested areas, or according to locally established procedures. NWS is more sensitive as
   taxi speed is increased.
   3.9.4. Taxi on the centerline unless local procedures direct otherwise. If local procedures
   direct staggered taxi, align the appropriate main wheel with the taxi line. The main wheel is
   approximately underneath the start of the wing dihedral. The most common reference to
   establish this stagger is to line up an exhaust stack on the taxi line.
   3.9.5. Avoid taxiing over cables to preclude aircraft damage. If a cable must be crossed, taxi
   as slowly as possible to prevent damage to the aircraft. Steer to avoid nose and main gear
   contact with cable support donuts.
   3.9.6. Maintain obstacle clearance and taxi interval distance according to AFI 11-2T-6,
   Volume 3.
   3.9.7. Prepare for takeoff and departure while taxiing in uncongested areas. Review and
   intercockpit briefings may include, but are not limited to, WX, winds, departure routing,
   navigational aid (NAVAID) setup, and takeoff emergencies. A widely used acronym is R-

       3.9.7.3. E—Emergencies. Review actions for abort or engine failure on takeoff.
       Consider emergency return options for existing conditions.
       3.9.7.4. W—WX/Winds. Consider WX impact on departure and emergency recovery
       options. Analyze effect of wind on takeoff and planned patterns, and anticipate pattern
       corrections. Determine direction the control stick needs to be deflected based upon
       crosswind component.
       3.9.7.5. S—Standard      Instrument      Departure       (SID)/Departure       Procedure
       (DP). Review departure, open in-flight publications to required page.
3.10. Overspeed Governor Check. Ensure area immediately in front of and behind the aircraft
is clear. During engine run-up for the overspeed governor check, the PNF guards and is ready to
assume control of the brakes in case of rudder pedal rod end failure. Clear outside the aircraft
during this check. If the aircraft moves, reduce power, pump up the brakes, and reattempt. Power
should be advanced smoothly and slowly only as high as required to verify proper function of the
overspeed governor. Keep the control stick in the neutral to slightly aft position to prevent the
nose gear strut from compressing during the check.
3.11. Before Takeoff and Lineup Checks. Review TOLD. In addition to normal checklist
items, it is common technique to scan the cockpit to check various items such as switch
positions, systems indications, security of in-flight publications, etc.
3.12. After Landing. Do not begin the after landing checklist until reaching normal taxi speed
and clear of the active RWY. Unless local procedures dictate otherwise, obtain clearance before
crossing active runways and (or) proceeding back to the ramp. Stay alert and taxi with caution.
Do not get complacent. The sortie is not complete until the aircraft is parked, the engine is
shutdown, and all required checklist items are complete.
3.13. Full Stop or Taxi Back. More than one full-stop landing may be accomplished during a
mission to achieve training objectives. Anticipate a longer than normal landing roll because of
higher fuel weight. Complete the full stop/taxi back checklist.
3.14. Engine Shutdown and Before Leaving Aircraft. Do not rush engine shutdown in an
effort to quickly get out of the aircraft. Keep ground personnel in sight and shut down
immediately if the prop safety zone is violated. If there is no marked prop safety zone (e.g., off
station), do not hesitate to shut down if ground personnel move too close. After exiting the
cockpit, perform the before leaving aircraft checklist. Ensure the ejection and CFS pins are
installed, the ISS is in SOLO, the battery switch and OBOGS lever are both off, the gust lock is
engaged and the parking brake is set before stepping down from the aircraft wing.
3.15. Postflight Inspection. After local sorties, ground personnel accomplish a thorough
postflight inspection. However, pilots should accomplish a postflight walkaround and report any
abnormalities (e.g., missing panels, damaged tires, leaking fluids, bird strikes, tail strikes) to
maintenance. The flight manual also contains detailed strange-field procedures that contain post
flight and pre-flight inspections for pilots to accomplish off station if trained maintenance
personnel are unavailable.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     49


3.16. Abnormal Procedures. Malfunctions are handled according to flight manual and other
applicable directives. As soon as possible, notify the controlling agency (ground or tower) if
assistance is required. If maintenance or fire personnel must inspect the aircraft, set the parking
brake and raise both hands (hands clear) to signal that it is clear to inspect the aircraft. Do not
actuate switches without informing the ground crew.
   3.16.1. Perform the emergency ground egress in a systematic, deliberate manner. When
   necessary to egress the aircraft because of an emergency, bring the aircraft to a complete stop
   and set the parking brake. Shut down the engine, ensure the ISS is in SOLO, and install both
   cockpit seat pins. Turn the battery and generator to OFF just before egress to preserve
   intercom with the other cockpit. CRM is critical to a successful ground egress.
   3.16.2. If returning to parking without taking off, complete the after landing checklist to
   ensure all systems are appropriately set.

                                           Chapter 4

                          TAKEOFF, CLIMB, AND LEVEL-OFF

4.1. Introduction. This phase of flight is very dynamic and can be as complicated as any other
part of the mission. Complex departure procedures may be required immediately after takeoff in
the low altitude environment, and communications can be very busy leaving the terminal area.
Emergency situations, when they occur in this phase of flight, require forethought and quick
correct action. Solid preparation is essential to success.
4.2. Lineup Check:
   4.2.1. Objective. Accomplish checklist items in preparation for takeoff.
   4.2.2. Description. This check is normally accomplished while taxiing onto the active
   RWY. The PF must ensure that all items are complete and ―BOTH‖ items are confirmed with
   the PNF.
   4.2.3. Procedure. Clear final prior to crossing the RWY hold short line and accomplish the
   lineup check.
   4.2.4. Technique. A common technique to remember the checklist steps is the acronym TP
   PLAN:
       4.2.4.1. T—TAS. Set TAS to NORM (if applicable).
       4.2.4.2. P—Panel. CWS panel shows normal lights.
       4.2.4.3. P—Probes. Turn on the anti-ice probes.
       4.2.4.4. L—Lights. Ensure all exterior lights are on.
       4.2.4.5. A—ALT. Select the ALT mode on the transponder.
       4.2.4.6. N—NWS. Deselect NWS after the aircraft is aligned with the RWY.
4.3. Takeoff:
   4.3.1. Objective. Safely get the aircraft airborne.
   4.3.2. Description. Two takeoff options exist: static and rolling. The static takeoff is used
   early in training because it provides more time to accomplish required checks and verify
   proper engine operation. A static takeoff is also required at night and for solo students. A
   rolling takeoff aids traffic flow in a busy pattern and is a smooth transition from taxi to
   takeoff roll. Rolling takeoffs have a negligible effect on TOLD and no recalculation is
   required.
       4.3.2.1. Airspeed. Rotate at 85 KIAS no wind. Add one-half the gust up to a maximum
       of 10 knots with gusty winds.
       4.3.2.2. Power. MAX.
       4.3.2.3. Pitch. 7-10 degrees NH at rotation.
       4.3.2.4. FCP visual reference. Spinner on, or slightly below the horizon.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    51


  4.3.3. Procedure. Do not accept takeoff clearance until ready for takeoff and the departure.
  Check the windsock and take note of winds reported by the RSU or tower controller.
  Anticipate takeoff clearance by listening to the position reports of other aircraft in the
  pattern. When cleared for takeoff, do not delay taking the RWY, ensure proper spacing
  behind aircraft on landing roll, and complete the lineup check.
     4.3.3.1. Static Takeoff. Stop when the aircraft is aligned with the RWY and the nose
     wheel is centered. Pump up the brakes to prevent creep during engine run-up. The PNF
     guards the brakes (without touching rudder pedals) ready to assume control. Clear down
     the RWY and advance the PCL to 25 to 30 percent torque. Cross-check outside to detect
     creep and check engine instruments. Release brakes to begin the takeoff roll and
     smoothly advance PCL to MAX. Check engine instruments when stabilized at maximum
     power (approximately 3 seconds after PCL reaches MAX) to ensure proper operation.
     4.3.3.2. Rolling Takeoff. Once the aircraft is aligned with the RWY and the nose wheel
     is centered, disengage NWS and smoothly advance the PCL to MAX. Check engine
     instruments when stabilized at maximum power (approximately 3 seconds after PCL
     reaches MAX) to ensure proper operation.
     4.3.3.3. Takeoff Roll. Without any crosswind, you will need to deflect the control stick
     to the right slightly to compensate for the torque generated at MAX power. When a
     crosswind is present, deflect the control stick in the direction of the crosswind component
     to keep the upwind wing from lifting (see paragraph 4.4). Position the elevator
     approximately neutral to prevent the nose gear from digging in during takeoff roll. Power
     application causes the aircraft to yaw to the left. Counteract this yaw by using right
     rudder. Place heels on the floor and the balls of the feet on the bottom of the rudder
     pedals to prevent accidental brake application and use rudder for directional control
     throughout the takeoff roll. The flight controls become more effective as airspeed
     increases, so progressively smaller control inputs are required to maintain aircraft control.
     At 60 knots, check that actual torque at least matches minimum power calculated during
     the before takeoff checklist. At rotation speed, smoothly apply back stick pressure to
     establish the takeoff attitude (7 to 10 degrees NH, Figure 4.1). Without wind gusts,
     rotation speed is 85 knots. If gusty winds are present, increase rotation speed by one-half
     the gust factor (up to 10-knot increase).
 52                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 4.1. FCP Takeoff Pitch Attitude.




   4.3.4. Technique. Cut the pitch picture in half (placing the spinner slightly below or on the
   horizon) to attain the takeoff attitude. Use control stick pressure as necessary to hold this
   attitude. Immediately after takeoff and safe gear retraction it will be necessary to apply right
   rudder trim in order to counteract adverse yaw and center the ball.
4.4. Crosswind Takeoff. The procedures for a takeoff with a crosswind are the same as for a
no-wind takeoff except aileron is held into the wind to keep the wings level. Aileron deflection is
necessary because the upwind wing develops more lift, causing it to fly (begin rising) before the
downwind wing. If the upwind wing rises, skipping may result (Figure 4.2). Skipping is a series
of very small bounces caused when the aircraft attempts to fly on one wing and settles back onto
the RWY. During these bounces, the aircraft moves sideways and increases stress on the landing
gear. Anticipate aileron requirement because of the crosswind and either pre-position aileron into
the wind or apply aileron into wind as required during takeoff roll. Use rudder to keep the
aircraft from weather vaning (e.g., crabbing or turning into the wind). The flight controls
become more effective as airspeed increases, so progressively smaller control inputs are required
to maintain aircraft control.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     53


Figure 4.2. Skipping on Takeoff.




4.5. After Becoming Airborne:
   4.5.1. Objective. Transition the aircraft from takeoff roll to climb.
   4.5.2. Description. Control inputs change significantly as the aircraft leaves the ground.
   Rudder requirements change as the wheels leave the ground and airspeed increases.
       4.5.2.1. Airspeed. Accelerate to climb airspeed (140 to 180 KIAS).
       4.5.2.2. Power. MAX.
       4.5.2.3. Pitch. As required to fly desired airspeed (normally 10 to 15 degrees).
   4.5.3. Procedures. Retract the gear and flaps when safely airborne with a positive climb
   rate, engine stabilized in MAX, and engine instruments check within limits. Gear and flap
   retraction should be a conscious, deliberate act. Before moving the gear handle, the PF makes
   an intercockpit gear clear call and pauses momentarily. On student pre-solo contact sorties,
   the IP must acknowledge the gear clear call with ―clear‖ before the student pilot raises the
   gear. On all other sorties, gear clear is an advisory call only. After gear and flap retraction,
   verbally confirm the landing gear warning lights are extinguished and the flaps are up before
   limiting speed. In addition, check that the engine instruments are within limits. As airspeed
   increases, nose-down trim is necessary to relieve pressure on the control stick.
4.6. After Becoming Airborne (Crosswind). Control inputs change significantly as the aircraft
leaves the ground. Crosswind controls must be released after takeoff, as the aircraft is allowed to
crab into the wind, to prevent the upwind wing from dipping toward the ground. Rudder
requirements change as the wheels leave the ground, airspeed increases, and the aircraft crabs
into the wind. Climb in coordinated flight and maintain RWY alignment on takeoff leg (Figure
4.3).
 54                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 4.3. Crabbing Into Crosswind After Takeoff.




4.7. Abnormal Procedures:
   4.7.1. Takeoff Aborts. If there is reason to ABORT the takeoff, do not hesitate to do so. If
   the PNF sees something hazardous, inform the PF. If the AC is not flying during a time-
   critical situation that requires immediate action and there is no time to relay this to the PF,
   the AC should take control of the aircraft and accomplish the appropriate procedures.
   4.7.2. Wake Turbulence/Prop Wash. Anticipate wake turbulence or prop wash when
   taking off behind other aircraft on the same or parallel runways, especially if the wind is
   calm or straight down the RWY. Wake turbulence is formed when an aircraft is creating lift,
   therefore plan to take off at a point prior to the preceding aircraft‘s takeoff point or after their
   point of touchdown. The T-6A is very susceptible to a rolling motion if within a preceding
   aircraft‘s prop wash.
4.8. Turns After Takeoff. Climb straight ahead until past the departure end of the RWY
(EOR), or as directed. Attain a minimum of 140 KIAS and 400 feet above ground level (AGL),
or per local directives, before the first turn after takeoff. The 400-foot restriction does not apply
to the VFR pattern.
4.9. Climbs:
   4.9.1. Objective. Establish the aircraft in a climb as required by local directives or
   published departure.
   4.9.2. Description:
       4.9.2.1. Airspeed. Accelerate to climb airspeed 140 to 180 KIAS according to local
       directives.
       4.9.2.2. Power. As required, normally MAX.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     55


      4.9.2.3. Pitch. As required to fly desired airspeed (normally 10 to 15 degrees).
   4.9.3. Procedures. Climbout airspeeds below 160 KIAS are permitted by the flight manual
   but not normally recommended because of high-pitch attitudes that limit forward visibility.
   Pilots are not required to make a significant pitch change in order to achieve standard climb
   speeds when conducting intermediate/small altitude changes (approximately 1000 to 2000
   feet) as this normally leads to an abrupt level-off. Initiate the climb check according to the
   flight manual passing 10,000 feet MSL. See Figure 4.4 for pitch attitudes.

Figure 4.4. Constant Airspeed Climb Pitch Attitudes.




      4.9.3.1. Straight Climb from Level Flight. Advance PCL and allow the aircraft pitch
      to increase. If above the desired climb speed, initially set the pitch to achieve the desired
      airspeed. After reaching the desired airspeed, lower the nose to keep airspeed constant as
      altitude increases. Make all pitch changes using outside references when available.
      Maintain heading by using section lines, a prominent point or object near the horizon, or
      other outside references, cross-checked with the heading on the EHSI. Maintain wings-
      level attitude by outside references cross-checked with the attitude indicator. Trim after
      power is set and the climbing attitude is established. Trimming is a continuous process
      throughout the climb and level-off. A climb attitude of 12.5 degrees NH results in a climb
      gradient of approximately 1,000 feet per nautical mile (NM), or what is referred to as a
      1:1 ratio. This climb gradient is determined by using the formula that 1 degree is equal to
      100 feet per NM. Level flight for 160 knots is about 2 to 3 degrees NH. Therefore a pitch
      attitude of 12.5 degrees is about 10 degrees above level flight resulting in 1000 feet per
      NM climb rate.
      4.9.3.2. Climbing Turns. If standard bank angles are not required to comply with
      published routings, use shallow-banked turns to maintain a higher rate of climb. Trim
      used in the turn must be taken out during the rollout.
      4.9.3.3. Level-off. Start the level-off at a lead point that allows a smooth transition to
      the desired level-off altitude. The standard method to achieve a smooth level-off is to use
      a lead point that is approximately 10 percent of the VSI. For example, if climbing at a
      rate of 2,000 feet per minute (fpm), start the level-off 200 feet below the desired altitude.
      At the lead point, smoothly lower the nose of the aircraft to level flight. Approaching the
      desired airspeed, adjust the PCL to obtain the desired airspeed and trim the aircraft.

     4.9.3.3.1. Operations Check. Conduct an operations check (ops check) at initial
     level-off and periodically throughout the flight, according to the flight manual.
     4.9.3.3.2. Technique. Perform an ops check approximately every 15 minutes while
     accomplishing area work. Using the stopwatch feature of the clock or accomplishing
     a check on the quarter hour (e.g., 1415, 1430, 1445, etc.) can help ensure checks are
     accomplished in a timely manner.

                          TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND LANDINGS

5.1. Introduction. In any traffic pattern, the RWY is the primary visual reference. Each airfield
has specific procedures designed to help prevent conflicts, assign traffic priority, and maximize
training. Base-specific traffic pattern diagrams and ground references are contained in the local
in-flight guide.
5.2. Letdown and Traffic Entry:
   5.2.1. Objective. Descend and enter traffic pattern.
   5.2.2. Description. Letdown is the transition from the enroute structure to the traffic
   pattern. In busy environments, detailed procedures are used for traffic sequencing and
   deconfliction. Strive to make all radio calls at the proper location. However, if deviations
   occur, always report actual location.
       5.2.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 250 KIAS according to local directives.
       5.2.2.2. Power. As required. Speed brake as required.
       5.2.2.3. Pitch. As required to meet altitude restrictions.
   5.2.3. Procedures:
       5.2.3.1. Comply with published routing and altitude restrictions.
       5.2.3.2. Monitor ATIS, if available.
       5.2.3.3. Clear pattern entry route.
   5.2.4. Techniques:
       5.2.4.1. Clearing turns during a visual meteorological conditions (VMC) letdown can
       improve clearing, control rate of descent and appropriately place a dedicated focus on
       outside visual references.
       5.2.4.2. Before the traffic pattern entry point, use the SUN or SUN-G check:
           5.2.4.2.1. S—Squawk. Squawk appropriate code.
           5.2.4.2.2. U—Ultra high frequency (UHF)/very high frequency (VHF). Set to
           proper frequencies.
           5.2.4.2.3. N—NACWS. Set to range that aids clearing.
           5.2.4.2.4. G—GPS. Select useful waypoint and omnibearing selector (OBS) to RWY
           heading.
5.3. Aircraft Configuration. Three configurations are used in the T-6. Normally, touch-and-go
landings are practiced with flaps takeoff. Full stop landings may be performed at any flap setting,
but normally flaps takeoff or landing are used. Crosswinds and gusty winds affect flap setting.
When flying in gusty winds, add one-half the gust up to a maximum of 10 knots to final
approach and touchdown speeds.
   5.3.1. Gear Down, Flaps Landing:
58                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


     5.3.1.1. Final turn/maneuver airspeed at 110 KIAS or on speed AOA, whichever is
     higher. Final airspeed at 100 KIAS. In the final turn, cross-check airspeed with AOA. At
     higher aircraft weights, higher airspeed may be required to maintain AOA on speed
     indication.
     5.3.1.2. Landing flaps are normally used for full-stop landings when landing distance is
     equal to or greater than 80 percent of RWY length. Not recommended in gusty wind
     conditions. Landing flaps should not be used in the training environment for landings
     with crosswinds greater than 10 knots because of the potential stresses the side loads
     impart on the landing gear. If an emergency exists, the crosswind limit for land flaps is 25
     knots.
     5.3.1.3. Generates significantly more drag than takeoff flaps. Requires lowest pitch
     attitude and highest power setting of the three configurations to maintain level flight.
     5.3.1.4. Decreases stall speed. Permits slower approach and landing speeds (see flight
     manual, Appendix A), resulting in reduced landing distance.
  5.3.2. Gear Down, Flaps Takeoff:
     5.3.2.1. Final turn/maneuver airspeed at 115 KIAS or on speed AOA, whichever is
     higher. Final airspeed at 105 KIAS. In the final turn, cross-check airspeed with AOA. At
     higher aircraft weights, higher airspeed may be required to maintain AOA on speed
     indication.
     5.3.2.2. Normally used for touch-and-go landings. May also be used for full-stop
     landings if landing distance not a factor.
     5.3.2.3. Recommended for full stop landings with crosswinds 10 knots or greater. May
     be used for full-stop landing in gusty winds.
     5.3.2.4. Generates slightly less lift, but much less drag compared to landing flaps.
     Provides for highest lift-to-drag ratio. Slightly lower power and slightly higher pitch
     required to maintain level flight compared to landing flaps.
     5.3.2.5. Stall speed slightly higher than landing flaps. Slightly longer landing distance
     than landing flaps.
  5.3.3. Gear Down, Flaps UP:
     5.3.3.1. Final turn/maneuver airspeed at 120 KIAS or on speed AOA, whichever is
     higher. Final airspeed at 110 KIAS. In the final turn, cross-check airspeed with AOA. At
     higher aircraft weights, higher airspeed may be required to maintain AOA on speed
     indication.
     5.3.3.2. May be used for full-stop landings with high crosswinds (greater than 20 knots)
     if landing distance not a factor.
     5.3.3.3. Generates least lift. Lowest power, but highest pitch attitude required of three
     configurations.
     5.3.3.4. Stall speed higher than TO flaps. Significantly longer landing distance than
     landing or takeoff flaps.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               59


5.4. Overhead Pattern and Landing. The 360-degree overhead pattern is used to safely
accommodate a maximum number of aircraft with minimum congestion. Adjust pattern spacing
for wind conditions. See Figure 5.1 depicting a normal traffic pattern and Table 5.1 listing
overhead pattern parameters. Note: When flying in gusty winds, add one-half the gust up to a
maximum of 10 knots to final approach and touchdown speeds.

   NOTES:
   1. Add one-half the gust factor up to 10 KIAS to final approach and touchdown speeds.
   2. Factors such as aircraft weight, crosswind, and outside air temperature may raise these speeds
   slightly.
   3. This does not mean that routinely landing in the first few feet or the very end of the target
   touchdown zone is desirable. A proper touchdown point has an adequate safety margin against
   landing short, yet allows the aircraft to easily stop within the available RWY.

  5.5. Initial:
     5.5.1. Objective. Align aircraft with landing RWY.
     5.5.2. Description:
          5.5.2.1. Airspeed. 200 KIAS.
          5.5.2.2. Power. 50 percent + 1 percent per 1,000 feet MSL altitude.
          5.5.2.3. Pitch. As required for level flight.
          5.5.2.4. Altitude. 1,000 to 1,500 feet AGL or according to local directives.
          5.5.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. Half ground, half sky.
     5.5.3. Procedure. Follow depicted pattern ground track. On initial, align with the RWY
     centerline, or as directed. Make required radio call.
  5.6. Break:
     5.6.1. Objective. Transition from initial to inside downwind.
 62                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   5.6.2. Description. 180 degrees level decelerating turn.
      5.6.2.1. Airspeed. Slow from 200 KIAS to 120 to 150 KIAS.
      5.6.2.2. Power. As required (approximately 10 percent).
      5.6.2.3. FCP Visual Reference. Drag NACWS/TAS antenna across horizon. Expect
      required pitch to increase slightly throughout the break.
   5.6.3. Procedure:
      5.6.3.1. The break zone is between the approach end and 3,000 feet down the RWY.
      Wind conditions and traffic spacing will affect the actual point where you start the break.
      RSU or tower controllers may direct you to break at a certain point within or outside the
      break zone.
      5.6.3.2. Clear in the direction of turn. Smoothly roll into approximately 45 to 60 degrees
      of bank and simultaneously adjust the PCL as required (approximately 10 percent). AOB
      and back pressure vary with wind conditions. Fly a level, decelerating turn to inside
      downwind trimming control stick forces as the airspeed decreases.
      5.6.3.3. On inside downwind continue to slow to 120 to 150 KIAS.
      5.6.3.4. As airspeed decreases, vary bank angle and/or G-loading to maintain level flight.
      Setting and maintaining a constant bank angle requires increasing aft stick deflection to
      remain level.
      5.6.3.5. If required to break beyond normal break point, maintain airspeed according to
      local directives until midfield downwind to aid traffic pattern spacing.
5.7. Inside or Closed Downwind:
   5.7.1. Objective. Maintain proper spacing and a ground track parallel to the RWY. Apply
   drift correction and offset inside/closed downwind ground track into the wind to account for
   the effects of wind on the final turn. Arrive at perch point at 120 KIAS minimum, properly
   configured, and ready to perform a planned 30-degree bank final turn.
   5.7.2. Description. Airspeed at 120 KIAS minimum, or according to local directives.
   5.7.3. Procedures:
      5.7.3.1. On inside downwind, with airspeed below 150 KIAS, make an intercockpit gear
      clear call and pause momentarily before moving the gear handle. On student pre-solo
      contact sorties, the IP must acknowledge the gear clear call with clear before the student
      pilot lowers the gear. On all other sorties, gear clear is an advisory call only.
      5.7.3.2. Lower the landing gear and flaps as required. As the flaps are lowered, the nose
      of the aircraft pitches up slightly because of the increase in lift. Maintain level flight by
      slightly increasing forward control stick pressure and trim for zero control stick forces.
      The objective is to be trimmed-up, hands-off as described in paragraph 2.9.1.5.
      5.7.3.3. Adjust power between approximately 30 and 45 percent depending upon flap
      setting to maintain airspeed (120 KIAS minimum) and pattern altitude.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    63


      5.7.3.4. Adjust spacing and perch point for winds. No wind spacing is approximately 0.7
      to 1.0 mile. Drift correction is approximately twice the correction used on initial. See
      Table 5.1 for visual references.
      5.7.3.5. PF verbally confirms completion of before landing checklist. PNF physically
      checks the gear handle down and acknowledges the aircraft configuration, according to
      local directives.
5.8. Perch and Final Turn:
   5.8.1. Objective. Use a descending 180-degree turn to align aircraft with the RWY. The
   final turn is complete when wings level on final.
   5.8.2. Description. For a no-wind pattern, the desired perch point occurs when the RWY
   threshold is approximately 45 degrees off your shoulder (Figure 5.2). See Table 5.1 for
   parameters.

Figure 5.2. Perch Point Reference.




   5.8.3. Procedure:
      5.8.3.1. Confirm aircraft configuration prior to the perch.
      5.8.3.2. Begin final turn (perch point) to allow for a one-half to three-quarter mile final.
      Correct for winds. For example, with a strong headwind on final, begin the final turn
      earlier than for a no-wind pattern. Displace the perch point into the wind affecting the
      final turn to rollout on a one-half to three-quarter mile final.

       5.8.3.3. Clear visually and with the radios. Do not start the final turn if conflicts exist or
       if potential conflicts are not in sight. Break out from inside downwind (pattern status
       permitting) using local procedures if:
           5.8.3.3.1. Another aircraft in the final turn is not in sight.
           5.8.3.3.2. A straight in is inside 2 miles and not in sight.
           5.8.3.3.3. An ELP is inside low key and normal spacing cannot be maintained.
           5.8.3.3.4. Pattern spacing cannot be maintained within the normal ground track.
           5.8.3.3.5. Not properly configured by the perch point.
       5.8.3.4. Start the final turn by adjusting power, lowering the nose, and rolling into 30
       degrees of bank.
       5.8.3.5. When able after starting the final turn, make a gear down call.
       5.8.3.6. Cross-check airspeed with AOA. At higher aircraft weights, higher airspeed may
       be required to maintain AOA on-speed indication.
       5.8.3.7. Plan to use no more than 30 degrees of bank, but do not exceed 45 degrees of
       bank during final turn as stall speed increases with increasing bank angle. If greater than
       45 degrees of bank is required to complete the final turn, initiate a go-around. Correct
       spacing on subsequent patterns to allow for 30 degrees bank in the final turn.
       5.8.3.8. Roll out on extended RWY centerline, approximately one-half to three-quarters
       of a mile from the RWY on a 3-to 4-degree glide path as you slow to final approach
       airspeed.
       5.8.3.9. If any doubt exists about the safety of continuing the approach, go around. Do
       not hesitate to disregard the ground track and use traffic pattern stall recovery procedures
       if required.
   5.8.4. Techniques:
       5.8.4.1. Pick a rollout point on final before beginning the final turn. Visualize the pitch
       and bank required to hit the rollout point. A good composite cross-check is critical to
       smoothly flying the final turn, and as a minimum should include the intended landing
       point, the rollout point, and airspeed.
       5.8.4.2. Halfway through the final turn (perpendicular to the RWY), cross-check aircraft
       altitude which should be approximately 600 feet AGL for a 1,000-foot pattern. This
       allows for aircrew to intercept final at one-half mile, approximately 200 feet AGL.
5.9. Final. Final provides the opportunity to stabilize airspeed and glide path before entering
the landing phase. Stable airspeed, proper glide path, and a fixed aim point provide the
consistency required for successful landing. Airspeed is based on configuration and winds, glide
path is 3 to 4 degrees, and under normal conditions the aim point is the RWY threshold.
   5.9.1. Objective. Maintain RWY alignment, proper glide path, and correct airspeed.
   5.9.2. Description. Final begins when wings level after the final turn and ends when the
   flare begins. See Table 5.1 for parameters.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    65


   5.9.3. Procedure. Begin slowing from final turn speed to final speed when beginning to roll
   out of bank, initially reducing power (approximately 5 to 10 percent) and maintaining or
   slightly adding backstick pressure to prevent the nose from dropping.
      5.9.3.1. Spacing. Maintain proper spacing with preceding aircraft. If spacing is
      insufficient, go around. After rolling out on final, initially use crab to maintain RWY
      alignment.
      5.9.3.2. On Final. On final, use a cross-check of aim point airspeed to focus attention
      on the most critical items. The aim point is usually about 500 feet short of the intended
      touchdown point and is usually the RWY threshold, but could vary based on headwinds.
      Visualize a constant glide path to the aim point.
      5.9.3.3. Crab. Crab allows the aircraft to maintain RWY alignment by weather vaning
      into the wind. The amount of crab required on final indicates the amount of control
      deflection needed to transition to the wing-low method. Do not land the T-6 with crab.
      See paragraph 5.11.3.5 for crosswind landing considerations.
      5.9.3.4. Airspeed and AOA. Cross-check airspeed with AOA. At higher aircraft
      weights, higher airspeed may be required to maintain an on-speed (amber donut) AOA
      indication. Above 700 to 800 pounds of fuel weight, approximately 3 to 5 knots above
      final turn and final airspeed may be required. Be alert and stop excessive sink rates with
      pitch and power. Heavy aircraft are less responsive to pitch and power changes, and
      develop sink rates quicker than light aircraft.
      5.9.3.5. Gusty Wind Conditions. Increase final approach airspeed by one-half the gust
      factor up to a 10-knot increase. (Gusty winds do not affect final turn speeds.) The aircraft
      may float farther than normal before touchdown because of the extra airspeed.
5.10. Straight-in Approach:
   5.10.1. Objective. Land with minimum maneuvering and gradual airspeed changes.
   5.10.2. Description. Visual maneuver that aligns the aircraft with the RWY for a constant
   speed, constant rate descent and landing. Situations that may require a straight-in approach
   include flight control malfunction, pitot-static problem, structural damage, or an unlocked
   canopy.
   5.10.3. Procedure:
      5.10.3.1. Request straight-in approach according to local directives.
      5.10.3.2. Descend to 500 feet AGL before the 5-mile or 5-mile radar point or according
      to local directives.
      5.10.3.3. Configure prior to 2-mile point.
      5.10.3.4. Slow to final approach speed once configured and before starting descent on
      glide path.
   5.10.4. Technique:
      5.10.4.1. With flaps landing or takeoff, begin the descent when the threshold of the
      RWY (aim point) is in the lower one-third of the windscreen. For flaps UP, begin the
      descent when the spinner reaches the threshold (aim point).
 66                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      5.10.4.2. Use actual distance from threshold (aim point) from GPS to determine proper
      point to begin descent. Begin descent between 1.25 and 1.67 miles from the aim point (3
      to 4 degrees glide path from 500 feet AGL). This can help develop ability to visually
      determine start descent point.
      5.10.4.3. Use straight-in to practice transition from crab to wing-low crosswind controls.
      A longer final affords more time to practice multiple transitions.
5.11. Normal landing:
   5.11.1. Objective. Land in proper landing zone, in proper landing attitude and on speed
   (Table 5.1).
   5.11.2. Description. The landing is divided into three phases: (1) roundout, (2) flare and
   touchdown, and (3) landing roll. Each of these phases serves as a transition from the previous
   phase to the next. The roundout serves as the transition from final to the flare. The flare is
   used to reduce energy in the transition from final to landing airspeed. The landing roll serves
   as the transition from landing to taxi. Groundspeed is reduced straight ahead on the RWY
   until at safe taxi speed.
   5.11.3. Procedure:
      5.11.3.1. Roundout. Use slight backstick pressure to reduce decent rate to a near
      horizontal flight path. Start a smooth power reduction to slow from final approach speed
      as aim point is shifted further down the RWY. At the threshold, airspeed should be
      approximately 10 knots below final airspeed.
      5.11.3.2. Flare and Touchdown. In the flare, back stick pressure is slowly increased as
      power is reduced to idle and airspeed further decreases. The aircraft will be in a slight
      descent or level flight depending on altitude, airspeed, power setting, and rate of
      deceleration.
          5.11.3.2.1. Use caution to avoid excess backstick, which could lead to a climb in the
          flare. Flare at a rate proportional to the rate of descent. For example, higher descent
          rates require faster application of back stick to attain normal descent rate prior to
          touchdown and prevent a firm landing. Similarly, a lower than normal descent rate
          requires slower control stick movement to prevent a high flare.
          5.11.3.2.2. As the nose rises, forward visibility is reduced and peripheral vision
          becomes the key factor in height and drift assessment. Continue back stick pressure to
          increase the pitch attitude until the proper landing attitude is reached. As descent rate
          and airspeed decrease, the aircraft gently settles onto the RWY. Touchdown is simply
          an end to the flare and should occur as landing speed is attained. Ensure PCL is idle at
          touchdown.
          5.11.3.2.3. In the flare, power can compensate for errors in judgment. Faster or
          slower power reductions can compensate for errors made in the roundout and early
          flare. Apply power and go around any time the controls feel mushy, the aircraft
          experiences an approach-to-stall indication, or if an excessively long touchdown will
          occur.
          5.11.3.2.4. Ensure feet are not on brakes when aircraft touches down.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  67


     5.11.3.3. Landing Roll. After touchdown and below approximately 80 KIAS on a full-
     stop landing, slowly relax back stick pressure to smoothly lower the nose gear to the
     RWY. Avoid banging the nose gear.
        5.11.3.3.1. With the nose gear on the RWY position the feet so the balls of the feet
        are on the top of the rudder pedals and smoothly apply brakes and increase back stick
        pressure. This increases weight on the main gear and helps prevent the nose gear from
        digging in, however, do not allow the nose gear to lift off the RWY. Continually
        increase back stick and brake pressure as the aircraft decelerates. Always brake in a
        straight line; do not turn and brake. Maintain directional control with rudder and (or)
        brakes. Use caution to avoid over controlling when applying brakes.
        5.11.3.3.2. At speeds below 80 KIAS, the chances of approaching optimum braking
        action are greatly increased. Use caution when braking at speeds above 80 KIAS. The
        physical limitations of the tire and brake system make it extremely difficult to
        consistently achieve maximum braking action, particularly at high speeds, as lift
        reduces the weight component. A single, smooth application, with increasing pressure
        as airspeed decreases, offers the best braking potential. Do not allow the wheels to
        lock during braking. Once a wheel is locked, it may be necessary to completely
        release brake pressure to allow wheel rotation.
        5.11.3.3.3. Confirm N1 reduction from 67 to 60 percent shortly after main gear
        touchdown (approximately 4 seconds).
        5.11.3.3.4. Select NWS when the aircraft is at a normal taxi speed and the rudder
        pedals are centered. Center rudder pedals before selecting NWS. At higher speeds,
        NWS is extremely sensitive and should only be used if directional control cannot be
        maintained with rudder and brakes. Intercept taxi line to transition from the RWY to
        the taxiway.
        5.11.3.3.5. If you encounter nose wheel shimmy during the landing roll, apply
        backstick pressure to relieve weight on the nose wheel, and then gently release
        pressure to reestablish contact with the RWY. If condition persists reapply back stick
        pressure.
        5.11.3.3.6. A low RWY condition reading (RCR), such as wet or icy RWY will
        influence controllability after landing.
     5.11.3.4. Landing on Alternate Sides of the Runway. When landing on alternate sides
     of the RWY, plan to land near the center of the RWY (main gear to wingtip on the
     centerline). The side of the RWY closest to normal turnoff routes is known as the cold
     side; the side away from the normal turnoff is the hot side. Landing in the center of the
     RWY is permissible if traffic and local procedures permit.
     5.11.3.5. Landing Considerations with Crosswinds. Introduce crosswind controls
     (wing-low) as required on short final. This requires rudder deflection to align the nose of
     the aircraft with the RWY and aileron deflection into the wind to stop drift. Crosswind
     controls increase drag, rate of deceleration, and stall speed. A small addition of power is
     necessary to counter these effects.
 68                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


          5.11.3.5.1. If power is used during the flare, retard the throttle to idle at touchdown.
          Crosswind controls must be held through touchdown and landing roll to prevent the
          upwind wing from rising and the aircraft from skipping. With significant crosswinds,
          expect one main gear to touchdown before the other.
          5.11.3.5.2. As the airspeed decreases, crosswind control deflection must increase to
          achieve the same effect. Proper use of aileron prevents a crosswind from lifting the
          upwind wing. When rudder effectiveness is lost, full aileron deflection may be
          necessary. In crosswinds greater than 10 knots, plan to use TO flaps and touchdown
          at approach speed minus 10 knots. The aircraft may float farther than normal before
          touchdown because of the extra airspeed.
          5.11.3.5.3. When introducing crosswind controls (wing-low), a common memory aid
          is the acronym RAP:
             5.11.3.5.3.1. R - Rudder to align the nose with the RWY.
             5.11.3.5.3.2. A - Aileron into the wind to prevent drift.
             5.11.3.5.3.3. P - Power to counteract increased drag (uncoordinated flight).
   5.11.4. Techniques:
      5.11.4.1. Roundout:
          5.11.4.1.1. Approximately 1,000 feet short of the aim point, reduce power to
          approximately 10 percent torque (about a knob width). Increase back stick pressure
          slightly and apply nose-up trim.
          5.11.4.1.2. Approximately 2 seconds after power is reduced (500 feet from aim
          point), start to shift aim point to the EOR.
          5.11.4.1.3. Begin further power reduction as aim point is shifted. The earlier power
          reduction, the slower the rate will be.
      5.11.4.2. Flare and Touchdown:
          5.11.4.2.1. Apply back stick pressure at the same rate that the aircraft settles toward
          the RWY, ultimately achieving the takeoff pitch picture. This allows for controlled
          deceleration and loss of altitude.
          5.11.4.2.2. Continue power reduction throughout flare. Base the rate of reduction on
          total energy (height, sink rate, and airspeed).
5.12. Touch-and-Go Landing:
   5.12.1. Objective. Accomplish multiple landings on a single sortie.
   5.12.2. Description. Normal landing followed by normal takeoff. After touchdown, power
   is advanced to MAX to execute takeoff. Lift off at approximately 85 KIAS.
   5.12.3. Procedure:
      5.12.3.1. Accomplish a normal landing. At main gear touchdown, smoothly apply power
      to MAX. As the PCL is advanced, slightly lower the nose to attain the takeoff pitch
      picture, but maintain sufficient back stick pressure to keep the nose gear off the RWY.
      Do not pull the aircraft off the RWY below normal takeoff speed.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    69


       5.12.3.2. Maintain desired ground track with crosswind controls (as necessary)
       throughout touchdown and takeoff roll. Control stick deflection for proper crosswind
       control constantly changes between flare and takeoff as airspeed, power, and weight on
       wheels change. Use the rudder for directional control to compensate for engine torque.
       As the torque increases after the PCL is advanced, the nose will tend to yaw to the left,
       and more right rudder will be required to keep the aircraft nose tracking straight down the
       RWY.
       5.12.3.3. Perform the after takeoff checklist when safely airborne with good engine
       indications, expected torque, and a visual climb from ground.
       5.12.3.4. The elevator trim required for final and landing may cause premature liftoff as
       power is applied. Forward control stick pressure may be required to compensate for the
       tendency of the nose to pitch up. This forward pressure can be significant depending on
       the amount of trim used for landing. Trim as necessary during the takeoff portion of
       touch-and-go to alleviate the pressure.
5.13. Closed Traffic (Closed Pull-Up) (Figure 5.3.):
   5.13.1. Objective. Maneuver the aircraft to closed downwind to perform multiple practice
   patterns and landings.
   5.13.2. Description. A climbing turn to closed downwind from initial takeoff, touch-and-go
   landing, or go-around. Minimum airspeed is 140 KIAS; maximum bank is 90 degrees.
       5.13.2.1. Airspeed. 140 KIAS minimum.
       5.13.2.2. Bank. 90 degrees maximum.
       5.13.2.3. Power. As required (normally MAX initially).
 70                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 5.3. Closed Pull-Up.




   5.13.3. Procedure:
      5.13.3.1. At 140 KIAS minimum and according to local directives, request clearance for
      a closed traffic pattern.
      5.13.3.2. When approved, clear and advance the PCL smoothly as required and start a
      climbing turn to the closed downwind leg, initially using approximately 60 degrees of
      bank. Closed downwind leg displacement should be the same as established with an
      overhead break.
      5.13.3.3. Approaching pattern altitude, reduce power to prevent acceleration.
      5.13.3.4. On closed downwind reduce power to maintain 140 to 150 KIAS until midfield
      or as directed locally.
   5.13.4. Technique:
      5.13.4.1. Begin a climbing turn and pull the nose up until horizon is between the rudder
      pedals.
      5.13.4.2. Lead the level-off on inside downwind by retarding the PCL to approximately
      20 percent torque. As a guide, begin power reduction 100 feet below pattern altitude for
      every 10 KIAS in excess of 140 KIAS. For example, if airspeed is 180 KIAS, start power
      reduction 400 feet below pattern altitude.
      5.13.4.3. Bank may be increased to 90 degrees to affect level-off, if vertical speed is
      excessive. A small amount of rudder in the direction of the turn will help bring the nose
      back to the horizon.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       71


5.14. Abnormal Pattern Procedures. Recognition of abnormal situations in the traffic pattern
is critical. Traffic conflicts or poorly flown patterns or landings can lead to dangerous situations.
If a potential traffic conflict is not in sight or a landing attempt looks or simply feels wrong, do
not hesitate to breakout or go around. If in doubt about the location of traffic, query the RSU or
tower controller. If at any time stall indications are observed, perform stall recovery procedures
and disregard ground track.
   5.14.1. Straight Through on Initial. To discontinue a pattern before the break, continue
   (carry) straight through at pattern altitude and 200 KIAS, according to local directives. At
   end of normal break zone, make radio call according to local directives (―Texan 11, break
   point straight through‖). At the departure end, or according to local directives, turn
   crosswind. Clear for aircraft turning crosswind, pulling closed, or established on inside
   downwind.
   5.14.2. Breakout from Overhead Pattern:
       5.14.2.1. At the home station, follow the local procedures for breaking out. In general, to
       perform a breakout, add power to MAX while starting a climbing turn away from the
       conflict. Then raise the gear and flaps, and confirm a clean aircraft prior to 150 knots.
       Level-off at breakout altitude and fly toward the VFR entry point. Make the appropriate
       radio call when able. After clear of all pattern ground tracks, descend and maneuver in
       accordance with local guidance to arrive wings level at pattern altitude at the VFR entry
       point.
       5.14.2.2. Use initiative and judgment when deciding to break out of the pattern. If
       directed to break out by the RSU, tower, or your instructor pilot, follow instructions
       without hesitation. However; do not wait to be directed to break out if you see a
       dangerous situation is developing.
       5.14.2.3. Use caution when breaking out from the inside downwind leg because of slow
       airspeed and configuration. Be cognizant of other aircraft breaking out at the same time.
       Never break out from the final turn; execute a go-around instead.
5.15. Go-Around:
   5.15.1. Objective. Safely discontinue pattern from final turn, final, or landing.
   5.15.2. Description. A go-around is termination of an approach after the aircraft is
   configured. Power is used to accelerate and the aircraft is deconfigured when appropriate. At
   low altitudes, a climb is established. At higher altitudes a continued descent may be required
   according to local directives.
   5.15.3. Procedures. Do not delay the decision and do not try to salvage a bad approach.
   Safety is enhanced by an early decision to go around if required. There should be no need for
   a RWY supervisor to direct a go-around for a poorly flown pattern.
       5.15.3.1. Final Turn, Final Approach and Landing Go-Around:
           5.15.3.1.1. Above 500 feet AGL, use power as required. Raise the gear and flaps, and
           accelerate to normal pattern airspeed. Continued descent may be required (normally
           to 500 feet AGL) to comply with local directives.
 72                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


           5.15.3.1.2. At or below 500 feet AGL, use power as required. When certain the
           aircraft will not touch down and with a positive climb indication, retract the landing
           gear and flaps.
           5.15.3.1.3. If the go-around is initiated in the landing phase, advance the PCL to
           MAX. Following a balloon or bounce, a touchdown (or second touchdown) may
           occur. Do not raise the gear until a positive rate of climb is established and the
           aircraft is assured of not touching down.
           5.15.3.1.4. As flaps retract, raise the nose slightly to offset tendency of the aircraft to
           sink.
           5.15.3.1.5. Clear the RWY (offset), if necessary, to avoid overflying aircraft on the
           RWY performing an initial takeoff or a touch and go. To offset, attain safe airspeed
           and altitude; then smoothly roll into a shallow-banked, coordinated turn. Turn
           approximately 20 degrees away from the RWY. When well clear of the RWY
           (enough to see traffic on takeoff roll and (or) departure leg), execute another shallow
           turn to parallel the RWY. Normally offset is performed toward the same side of the
           RWY as inside downwind. Comply with local procedures. Add offset to call sign for
           RSU requests.
           5.15.3.1.6. Allow the aircraft to accelerate to between 140 and 200 KIAS, then climb
           or descend to 500 feet above the terrain until past the departure end of the RWY or
           according to local directives.
5.16. Final Irregularities. Depending on the nature and magnitude of an irregularity and
aircraft flight parameters, correction and continued final may be possible. However, a go-around
is always acceptable.
   5.16.1. Low (Drug-In) Final. Aircraft below proper glide path:
       5.16.1.1. Causes:
           5.16.1.1.1. Early descent on straight-in approach.
           5.16.1.1.2. Long perch coupled with normal pitch and descent rate. Altitude rolling
           out on final is as planned, but long perch leads to longer than desired final.
           5.16.1.1.3. Excessive altitude loss from diving final turn.
           5.16.1.1.4. Failure to maintain proper glide path.
       5.16.1.2. Effects: Normal power settings are too low to maintain airspeed on shallower
       glide path. Airspeed and altitude may decrease.
       5.16.1.3. Recovery:
           5.16.1.3.1. If too low or slow, go around. Avoid obstacles.
           5.16.1.3.2. Add power, level-off, and intercept proper glide path.
   5.16.2. Steep Final. Aircraft above proper glide path:
       5.16.2.1. Causes:
           5.16.2.1.1. Too close to RWY on inside downwind.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        73


           5.16.2.1.2. Early perch.
           5.16.2.1.3. Level final turn.
       5.16.2.2. Effects. High descent rate with low power setting. Low power setting, coupled
       with the pitch change required to intercept normal glide path, could result in rapid
       decrease in airspeed and high sink rate. If not corrected, this power-deficient situation
       could result in a stall or firm touchdown.
       5.16.2.3. Recovery:
           5.16.2.3.1. Go around if sink rate is too high or if it is not practical to intercept
           normal glide path with a normal descent rate.
           5.16.2.3.2. Use slightly higher than normal descent rates as soon as deviation is
           recognized. Use power as required to control airspeed in descent and maintain
           airspeed when on normal glide path.
   5.16.3. Slow Final. Increased pitch attitude is required to maintain lift as airspeed is
   reduced.
       5.16.3.1. Cause. Improper glide path or power setting.
       5.16.3.2. Effects:
           5.16.3.2.1. Higher than normal pitch attitude. Inaccurate perception of the proper
           glide path.
           5.16.3.2.2. Increased AOA and increased likelihood of stall, especially in gusty wind
           conditions.
           5.16.3.2.3. Increasing pitch leads aim point to shift down the RWY.
       5.16.3.3. Recovery:
           5.16.3.3.1. Apply power at an altitude high enough to reestablish the correct airspeed
           and attitude. If altitude is insufficient, go-around.
           5.16.3.3.2. Correct aim point and glide path to reestablish proper airspeed.
5.17. Landing Irregularities. Airspeed in the flare is just above stall airspeed. Even at slow
airspeeds, the elevator is still very effective. Any abrupt change in pitch could result in a balloon,
a bounce, or even a stall. When any of these conditions are encountered, apply MAX power,
adjust the pitch attitude, and initiate a go-around if it is unsafe to continue the landing. If power
is applied and the aircraft continues to settle, do not try to hold it off by raising the nose above
the landing attitude. A touch down with too high of a nose attitude could result in a tail strike.
Hold the landing attitude and let the aircraft touch down. MAX power cushion the contact. In
case of a hard landing, do not raise the gear.
   5.17.1. High Flare:
       5.17.1.1. Cause. Roundout performed too early or with excessive pitch up.
       5.17.1.2. Effects. Airspeed decay and or hard, long landing.
           5.17.1.2.1. Possible premature touchdown of nose gear caused by abrupt pitch down
           to compensate for high flare.
74                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


        5.17.1.2.2. Stall if flare continued with excess altitude.
        5.17.1.2.3. Hard landing because of high sink rates as airspeed decreases at higher
        than normal altitude.
     5.17.1.3. Recovery:
        5.17.1.3.1. With adequate airspeed and RWY remaining, release a small amount of
        back pressure to increase descent rate. As aircraft approaches normal altitude,
        increase back pressure to reestablish normal flare.
        5.17.1.3.2. If in a landing attitude and excess altitude would require an end swap to
        land, do not attempt landing, and initiate a go-around. Remember, as landing attitude
        is attained, the aircraft is rapidly approaching a stall and there is insufficient margin
        of error for radical pitch changes in the flare.
  5.17.2. Late and Rapid Roundout:
     5.17.2.1. Cause. Higher than expected descent rate or misjudged altitude.
     5.17.2.2. Effects. Possible incomplete flare, ballooned flare, hard touchdown.
        5.17.2.2.1. Firm touchdown because of higher than normal descent rates or
        insufficient time to complete flare.
        5.17.2.2.2. Abrupt roundout to prevent premature or firm touchdown may lead to an
        accelerated stall. This is a dangerous situation that may cause an extremely hard
        landing and damage to the main gear. This may or may not be a controllable situation,
        depending on airspeed.
     5.17.2.3. Recovery. Hold landing attitude and add power. Immediate use of power
     increases thrust, lift, and controllability. It also enables a recovery and go-around. The
     main gear may contact the ground a second time, but if recovered properly, the second
     contact is usually moderate.
  5.17.3. Porpoising:
  5.17.3.1. Cause. Incorrect landing attitude and airspeed. At touchdown, the nose gear
  contacts the RWY before the main gear.
     5.17.3.2. Effects. The aircraft bounces back and forth between the nose gear and main
     gear. Without immediate corrective action, the porpoise progresses to a violent, unstable
     pitch oscillation. Repeated heavy impacts on the RWY ultimately cause structural
     damage to the landing gear and airframe.
     5.17.3.3. Recovery.
        5.17.3.3.1. Immediately position the controls to the takeoff attitude to prevent the
        nose wheel from contacting the RWY, simultaneously advance the PCL to MAX, and
        initiate a go-around.
        5.17.3.3.2. Do not attempt to counteract each bounce with opposite control stick
        movement. The combined reaction time of pilot and aircraft is such that this control
        movement aggravates the porpoise. Hold the controls in the recovery position to
        dampen the oscillations. Power increases control effectiveness by increasing airspeed.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    75


         5.17.3.3.3. Do not raise the landing gear after a porpoise. Structural damage may
         prevent normal gear operation.
  5.17.4. Floating:
     5.17.4.1. Cause. Late power reduction, excessive airspeed, or improper flap setting.
     5.17.4.2. Effects. Long landing. Possible balloon or bounce.
     5.17.4.3. Recovery. Dependent on magnitude of float and RWY remaining.
         5.17.4.3.1. For a slight float, airspeed permitting, gradually increase pitch attitude as
         airspeed decreases and landing speed is approached.
         5.17.4.3.2. Avoid prolonged floating, especially in strong crosswinds. If a long
         landing is inevitable, initiate a go-around.
  5.17.5. Ballooning:
     5.17.5.1. Cause. Rapid roundout or flare. Raising the nose to the landing attitude before
     lift has decreased sufficiently.
     5.17.5.2. Effects. Altitude gain (dependent on airspeed and pitch rate).
     5.17.5.3. Recovery:
         5.17.5.3.1. Landing may be completed from a slight balloon. Hold landing attitude as
         the aircraft settles to RWY. Maintain wing-low crosswind controls through the
         balloon and landing.
         5.17.5.3.2. Go-around from a pronounced balloon. Do not attempt to salvage the
         landing.
  5.17.6. Bouncing:
     5.17.6.1. Causes:
         5.17.6.1.1. Firm or hard touchdown causes aircraft to bounce off RWY.
         5.17.6.1.2. Contact with ground before landing attitude is attained.
         5.17.6.1.3. Late recognition that aircraft is settling too fast, combined with excessive
         back stick pressure.
     5.17.6.2. Effects. Height reached depends on the force with which the aircraft strikes the
     RWY, the amount of back stick pressure held, and the speed at touchdown.
     5.17.6.3. Recovery. Same as a balloon, depending on severity of bounce.
  5.17.7. Slight Bounce. Continue the landing. Maintain direction with wing-low crosswind
  controls and smoothly adjust pitch to the landing attitude just before touchdown.
  5.17.8. Severe Bounce (Aircraft Rising Rapidly). Do not attempt a landing from a
  significant bounce, go-around immediately.
     5.17.8.1. Simultaneously apply MAX power, maintain direction, and lower nose to a safe
     pitch attitude.
     5.17.8.2. Continue go-around even if another bounce occurs.
 76                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       5.17.8.3. Leave the landing gear extended if a hard landing is encountered.
   5.17.9. Bouncing in Crosswinds. Use extreme caution. When one wheel strikes the RWY,
   the other wheel touches down immediately after. The crosswind correction is lost and the
   aircraft drifts. Reestablish crosswind controls to stop the drift and either continue the landing
   or go around, depending on the situation.
   5.17.10. Landing in a Drift or Crab. Aircraft contacts the RWY in a crab or drifting
   sideways. Throughout final, flare, and touchdown, in a crosswind, the aircraft should track in
   a straight line down the RWY. With wing-low crosswind controls, align the fuselage with the
   RWY. Insufficient wing-low crosswind controls result in landing with a drift, in a crab, or a
   combination of both.
       5.17.10.1. Cause. Failure to apply sufficient wing-low crosswind corrections.
       5.17.10.2. Effects. Excessive side loads on landing gear, potential gear damage.
       5.17.10.3. Recovery. Go-around if unable to apply proper crosswind controls before
       touchdown.
   5.17.11. Wing Rising After Touchdown:
       5.17.11.1. Cause. Lift differential combined with rolling moment. During crosswind
       landing, air flow is greater on the upwind wing because the fuselage reduces air flow over
       the downwind wing. This causes a lift differential. The wind also strikes the fuselage on
       the upwind side, and this causes a rolling moment about the longitudinal axis, which may
       further assist in raising the upwind wing. When effects of these two factors are great
       enough, one wing may rise even though directional control is maintained.
       5.17.11.2. Effect. Depending on the amount of crosswind and degree of corrective
       action, directional control could be lost. If no correction is applied, one wing can raise
       enough to cause the other wing to strike the ground.
       5.17.11.3. Recovery. Use ailerons to keep the wings level. Use rudder and/or
       asymmetric braking to maintain directional control. Aileron is more effective if applied
       immediately. As the wing rises, the effect increases as more wing area is exposed to the
       crosswind.
5.18. AOA Patterns (U. S. Navy). The RWY, aim point, and computed airspeed are primary
references in the Air Force traffic pattern. The AOA pattern is different, as AOA is kept constant
while airspeed decreases through the final turn and final. The AOA pattern is crucial to
successful short field operations with high performance aircraft. AOA patterns are common in
Air Force fighter aircraft and virtually mandatory for Navy carrier operations.
   5.18.1. Objective. Familiarize Navy primary students with the AOA system and AOA-
   based pattern operations.
   5.18.2. Description. The AOA pattern and approach is the same as a normal traffic pattern
   until the aircraft is configured. Once configured, use pitch to maintain optimum AOA (on
   speed center donut on the AOA indexer, 10 to 11 units on the AOA gauge) and power to
   control glide path (rate of descent). It is critical to remember that the AOA indexer
   information is only usable if proper glide path is maintained. Flying on speed AOA on an
   improper glide path may cause a short landing.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                77


  5.18.3. Procedure:
     5.18.3.1. The T-6 AOA indexer uses colors that match the Navy Fresnel Lens Optical
     Landing System‘s color scheme. This color scheme differs from that used on Air Force
     aircraft. For this reason, the nomenclature of symbol position on the AOA indexer (upper
     chevron, center donut, lower chevron) is used instead of symbol color in this manual. The
     symbols indicate distinct AOA conditions. The center donut illuminates when the aircraft
     is in the optimum AOA range. The upper and lower chevrons indicate, by the direction of
     the chevron angle, which direction to change pitch attitude to achieve optimum AOA.
     5.18.3.2. For a pattern with gear down, flaps landing, and PCL set for a 3-degree glide
     path, the optimum approach speed (center donut) is approximately 100 KIAS at
     maximum landing weight. As landing weight decreases, approach AOA (center donut)
     continues to provide the optimum approach speed and maneuver speed (regardless of
     bank angle). Optimum approach airspeed decreases approximately 1 knot for every 100
     pounds of fuel burned.
     5.18.3.3. Initial, break, and closed pull-ups are flown the same as the normal pattern.
     Students configure with TO flaps.
     5.18.3.4. Configure early enough to ensure the aircraft is at optimum AOA (on speed
     center donut on the AOA indexer, 10 to 11 units on the AOA gauge) with a stabilized
     power setting by the perch. Airspeed will be less than 120 KIAS (the minimum airspeed
     for normal Air Force patterns prior to the perch). Adjust power to maintain level flight
     and on speed AOA indications. (See Figure 5.4)
 78                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 5.4. AOA Traffic Pattern at Air Force Bases.




       5.18.3.5. Initiate final turn with 30 degrees of bank. Bank angles of up to 45 degrees may
       be used to prevent an overshoot. Use pitch to adjust AOA and power to adjust descent
       rate or glide path. AOA indexer chevrons point in the direction the nose needs to be
       moved. For example, if the upper (slow) chevron is illuminated, AOA is higher than
       optimum, then lower the nose. If steep, reduce power. If shallow, increase power.
       5.18.3.6. During final turn and final, cross-check the AOA indexer, AOA gauge, and aim
       point (normally RWY threshold). Rollout on final should be approximately one-half mile
       from the aim point. Power is reduced later and/or slower than in a normal pattern because
       of the slower than normal approach speed. Maintain final approach power setting through
       the roundout until the sink rate is sufficiently reduced, then smoothly reduce power to
       idle and touch down normally. Perform normal touch-and-go or landing procedures.
       AOA pattern training does not include AOA landings.
5.19. Emergency Landing Patterns (ELP). The ELP is a 360-degree pattern designed to
position the aircraft for landing when the possibility of a power loss exists, power is not
available, or only partial power is available. If an engine failure or malfunction in flight requires
an ELP, a thorough understanding of T-6 flight performance, emergency procedures, ELPs, and
ejection system capabilities, is critical in the decision to eject or attempt an ELP. An ELP might
be warranted for a fire warning in flight, engine failure (after takeoff and during flight), or any
indication of impending engine failure or unusual engine operation. If there is any doubt about
engine performance or there is benefit to remaining in the ejection envelope longer, consider
recovering via an ELP. The time available to decide whether to recover via ELP or eject depends
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     79


on the phase of flight and the severity of the engine malfunction. In the event of an actual engine
failure, time available can range from a few seconds (engine failure on takeoff) to over 20
minutes for a high-altitude power loss (HAPL). Figure 5.5 provides a graphic depiction of factors
affecting the decision to continue an ELP attempt or eject. ELPs are only flown to suitable
landing areas (hard surface RWY, taxiway, under run, or overrun) of sufficient length. Landing
on an unprepared surface should only be attempted if ejection is not possible.
   5.19.1. ELP Types. There are two types of actual ELPs: the forced landing (FL) and PEL.
   The primary difference between the two is the availability of power. The ELP profile
   depicted in Figure 5.7 is used for both the FL and PEL. The FL is flown with the engine
   inoperative (no power) and the PEL is flown with power available, although engine failure
   may be imminent or power available may be less than normal. For training, simulate a
   feathered prop on simulated forced landings (SFL) by setting 4 to 6 percent torque. Likewise
   on a PEL, when the aircraft is established on proper energy profile, fly the maneuver with 4
   to 6 percent torque. If flown correctly, the FL and PEL look the same.
   5.19.2. ELP ORM:
       5.19.2.1. FL:
           5.19.2.1.1. In an actual engine failure scenario, the methodology to descend below
           the minimum controlled ejection altitude employs the use of the acronym ORM 3-2-
           1.
           5.19.2.1.2. ORM 3-2-1 means that with an engine malfunction requiring a FL, T-6
           aircrews will not descend below 2000 feet AGL unless they are (O) on profile for the
           field of intended landing, with the (R) RWY in sight and in a position to safely (M)
           maneuver to land. The point to make the final decision to continue or eject is 300 feet
           AGL (3). At 200 feet AGL (2), the gear will be confirmed and reported down, and at
           100 feet AGL (1) the aircraft should be on centerline.
       5.19.2.2. PEL:
           5.19.2.2.1. The recommended minimum ceiling for a PEL is also 2,000 feet;
           however, ORM 3-2-1 is not applicable to PELs.
           5.19.2.2.2. In an impending engine failure or unusual engine operation scenario
           requiring a PEL with questionable WX, the inability to be clear of clouds by 2,000
           feet AGL does not necessitate immediate ejection. Depending on actual WX
           conditions, a normal overhead, visual straight-in, or instrument approach may be
           flown as an alternate means of recovery.

   5.19.3. Initial Actions. Initial reaction to an engine-related malfunction at low altitude
   should be to trade excess airspeed for altitude (zoom) according to emergency procedures.
   Above 150 KIAS, initiate a zoom climb using a 2-G pull-up to a 20-degree climb angle until
   approaching 20 KIAS above the desired glide airspeed. Then lower the nose to maintain the
   desired glide speed. At higher altitudes, the requirement to zoom or simply decelerate to
   glide speed is based on distance to the selected recovery field. The PEL checklist in the flight
   manual offers an organized approach to recovery with an engine malfunction, and some of
   the steps are equally useful for an engine failure in flight. A good memory aid for these steps
   (PEL checklist) is; ―turn, climb, clean, check, and BIP (boost pump, ignition, and plan):‖
      5.19.3.1. Turn. Turn immediately to the nearest suitable field based on aircraft
      condition, WX, airfield conditions, altitude, and gliding distance available. In most PEL
      situations (chip light, low oil pressure, etc.), time is the most critical element. The longer
      the engine runs, the greater the chance for complete failure.
          5.19.3.1.1. Choosing the Most Suitable Field. Pilot judgment may lead to selection
          of an airfield that is not necessarily the nearest. For example, a usable airfield with a
          less than 4,000-foot RWY may be only a few minutes away, but the situation may
          warrant a longer glide or use of the engine longer to reach a field that is familiar or
          has a significantly longer RWY, crash crew support, or medical assistance. In no case
          should the engine-out glide range for the nearer field be exceeded until the aircraft is
          within engine-out glide range of the desired field. Being at sufficient altitude to be
          able to make an airfield using an engine-out glide is referred to as ―being on profile‖
          or ―being in the bubble.‖ Being on profile for a near field and climbing so as to be on
          profile for a further, but more desirable, field is called ―bubble hopping.‖ Winds, WX,
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                 81


        and the risks associated with remaining airborne for a longer period of time with
        potential aircraft problems all need to be weighed before making the decision to
        bubble hop. In most cases, landing with an operational engine is preferred to
        performing a forced landing.
        5.19.3.1.2. Factors for Consideration. In the event of engine malfunction or
        failure, there may be more than one airfield within glide distance. Select the most
        suitable based on these factors:
            5.19.3.1.2.1. Distance to airfield.
            5.19.3.1.2.2. Terrain around airfield.
            5.19.3.1.2.3. RWY length, width, direction, and condition.
            5.19.3.1.2.4. WX.
            5.19.3.1.2.5. Fire or rescue support.
            5.19.3.1.2.6. Emergency oxygen and electrical power supply. Time required for
            glide from high altitude with engine inoperative may exceed emergency oxygen
            supply.
            5.19.3.1.2.7. Threat to the public if aircraft must be abandoned.
        5.19.3.1.3. Distance Calculations. A VFR map, conventional NAVAIDs, and GPS
        airfield, user-defined waypoints, and terminal waypoints can be used when judging
        distance to the selected recovery airfield. The NRST (nearest airfield) function on the
        GPS is extremely helpful in providing accurate distance information. Two primary
        methods used to determine energy state relative to emergency fields are:
            5.19.3.1.3.1. DME Method. A memory aid is Half-DME + Key (MSL).
                5.19.3.1.3.1.1. Half-DME. Determine distance to field (GPS NRST
                function). Divide distance by 2. This is the minimum AGL altitude to reach
                the field via straight-in glide, no wind.
                5.19.3.1.3.1.2. Plus+ Key. Add 3,000 feet (high key) or 1,500 feet (low key)
                to determine altitude required to arrive at the desired key.
            5.19.3.1.3.2. Altitude Method:
                5.19.3.1.3.2.1. Determine max glide distance (AGL altitude multiplied by 2).
                5.19.3.1.3.2.2. Subtract 3,000 feet (high key) or 1,500 feet (low key). This is
                the required altitude to achieve desired key on profile.
                5.19.3.1.3.2.3. Divide by 1,000 to determine fields within gliding distance.
                (GPS NRST function).
     5.19.3.2. Climb. Climb to intercept ELP profile to recovery airfield. Climb (zoom) to
     trade excess airspeed (greater than 150 KIAS) for altitude. If not within engine-out glide
     distance of high key, use the highest suitable power setting and 140 KIAS to climb (best
     rate). Once altitude is sufficient to make high key, reduce power to 4 to 6 percent torque
     and trim for a 125-knot (minimum) descent. When climbing, do not lose SA or visual
82                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


     contact (if acquired) with the intended landing RWY. When determining altitude required
     for ELP, be sure to account for winds and required turns.
        5.19.3.2.1. The preferred method to gain energy is a climb; however, WX conditions
        may prevent a climb to the required altitude. If unable to climb because of clouds,
        icing, etc., increase energy by accelerating to a higher airspeed. Remain clear of
        clouds until in position to descend and (or) decelerate to enter the ELP.
        5.19.3.2.2. Ten knots of extra airspeed can be traded for approximately 100 feet of
        increased altitude. For example, 175 KIAS and 6,000 feet is approximately the same
        energy level as 125 KIAS and 6,500 feet.
     5.19.3.3. Clean. Clean up the aircraft by raising landing gear, flaps, and speed brake (as
     appropriate for the emergency) as soon as possible. Retraction may not be possible if the
     engine fails. Remember that excess drag inhibits the climb and greatly reduces gliding
     range. At optimum glide airspeeds, the drag of extended landing gear reduces the glide
     ratio (NM divided by 1,000 feet of altitude) from 2:1 to 1.5:1.
     5.19.3.4. Check. Check the aircraft. Look at all indications. Continue analyzing the
     situation and take the proper action while intercepting or maintaining the ELP profile.
     5.19.3.5. Boost Pump, Ignition, and Plan (BIP):
        5.19.3.5.1. Switches On. Turn boost pump and ignition switches on (as required) for
        fuel related malfunctions.
        5.19.3.5.2. Plan. The above considerations and energy state should lead to one of
        four decisions:
            5.19.3.5.2.1. Intercept the ELP profile at or above high key.
            5.19.3.5.2.2. Intercept the ELP profile at a point other than high key with the
            appropriate configuration and airspeed.
            5.19.3.5.2.3. For FL scenarios, eject when it becomes clear that the aircraft
            cannot be recovered safely (ORM 3-2-1).
            5.19.3.5.2.4. With an engine malfunction, depending on actual WX conditions, a
            normal overhead, visual straight-in, or instrument approach is highly
            recommended as an alternate means of recovery.
  5.19.4. HAPL:
     5.19.4.1. Objective. Identify the nearest suitable airfield and safely maneuver the
     aircraft to intercept ELP profile. Arrive at high key aligned with the landing RWY. If
     high key cannot be reached, intercept profile at a point before low key. Make a timely
     decision to continue or terminate the ELP and eject.
     5.19.4.2. Description. Loss of power at any altitude above high key altitude.
     5.19.4.3. Airspeed. Maintain 125 KIAS minimum clean or 120 KIAS minimum with
     landing gear.
     5.19.4.4. Power:
        5.19.4.4.1. SFL. 4 to 6 percent torque (simulates PCL off).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    83


         5.19.4.4.2. PEL. Adjust as required until on profile, 4 to 6 percent torque once on
         profile.
     5.19.4.5. Procedure. Maintain aircraft control and analyze the situation. Accomplish
     boldface procedures.
         5.19.4.5.1. Carefully manage energy to arrive at high key on altitude. Attempt to
         dissipate excess energy prior to high key to minimize disorientation and allow the
         profile to be flown normally. To lose energy, slip, S-turn, lower the gear early, or use
         a combination of all three. Another method to lose the excess altitude is to make 360-
         degree turns prior to high key. This is generally accomplished very near or directly
         over the intended landing destination.
         5.19.4.5.2. Approximate altitude loss for 360-degree turns:
             5.19.4.5.2.1. 30-degree bank, 2,000 feet.
             5.19.4.5.2.2. 45-degree bank, 1,500 feet.
             5.19.4.5.2.3. 60-degree bank, 1,000 feet.
     5.19.4.6. Glide Performance. A clean glide at 125 KIAS approximates best glide range.
     For no-wind planning, a clean aircraft (prop feathered or 4-6 percent torque set) at 125
     KIAS should glide 2 miles for every 1,000 feet of altitude lost (2:1 glide ratio), with a
     VSI of approximately 1,350-1,500 fpm.
         5.19.4.6.1. Check the descent rate after setting 4- to 6-percent torque (clean
         configuration). If the VSI is greater than 1,500 fpm, increase torque to achieve a
         1,350 fpm descent. If power is insufficient to achieve a descent rate less than 1,500
         fpm, consider shutting down the engine to improve glide performance. If Np is less
         than 100 percent, traditional torque values are no longer accurate. Crews will need to
         find what torque will give them a rate of descent of 1,350 to 1,500 fpm, then utilize
         that torque during the PEL.
         5.19.4.6.2. If time permits, use DME or GPS to confirm the actual glide ratio.
         Consider winds and required turns. Adjust the plan if actual glide distance varies from
         expected.
         5.19.4.6.3. If unable to climb or zoom, the aircraft travels in a level deceleration
         approximately 0.1 to 0.2 NMs (approximately 1,000 feet) of horizontal distance for
         every 10 knots of excess airspeed above 125 KIAS. For example, at 200 KIAS the
         aircraft glides approximately 1.2 NM straight and level before slowing to 125 KIAS.
  5.19.5. Slips:
     5.19.5.1. Objective. Dissipate energy to achieve ELP profile while proceeding in a
     desired direction.
     5.19.5.2. Description. A slip is uncoordinated flight used to increase the sink rate and
     lose altitude with a constant airspeed and ground track.
     5.19.5.3. Procedure. May be used at any point in an actual ELP; however, it is
     potentially dangerous in a configured T-6 close to the ground. Caution must be exercised,
     since stall speed is greatly increased in this out-of-balance flight condition. The slip must
84                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


     be taken out with enough altitude remaining (300 feet for training) to slow the rate of
     descent and ensure positive control of the aircraft during the final moments of the
     maneuver. Lower one wing and apply opposite (top) rudder pressure. Monitor airspeed
     closely and adjust nose attitude as necessary to maintain 125 KIAS (120 KIAS
     configured). Monitor the VSI and note the increased rate of descent. In a full slip, the rate
     of descent may be in excess of 2,000 fpm. As a guideline, keep the nose below the
     horizon in a full slip. During aggressive slips, a fuel low light may come on but should
     extinguish after the slip maneuver is terminated. If the pilot reverses the control inputs
     (opposite rudder and aileron), without first neutralizing controls to reverse the turn
     direction, the aircraft may depart controlled flight. Use extreme caution when reversing
     control inputs during slip maneuvers.
         5.19.5.3.1. Straight Ahead. Select a reference point on the horizon and adjust
         rudder pressure and/or the AOB to keep the nose on the point.
         5.19.5.3.2. Turning. Lower the inside wing while increasing opposite (top) rudder
         pressure. It is necessary to vary the AOB and rudder pressure to maintain the desired
         ground track.
         5.19.5.3.3. Recovery. Smoothly roll the wings toward level while reducing rudder
         pressure. The slip must be taken out with enough altitude remaining to slow the rate
         of descent and ensure positive control of the aircraft during the final moments of any
         maneuver in which it is used.
  5.19.6. GPS Use on HAPL/ELPs (Figure 5.6.) The GPS can provide vital information,
  but do not sacrifice aircraft control or profile maintenance in an attempt to get GPS
  information that you do not need to safely recover the aircraft. Although the NRST function
  may provide quick information about an airfield, other resources, such as the in-flight guide,
  may also provide the required executable data.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                85

   5.19.7. Flying an ELP:
      5.19.7.1. Objective. Safely land from high key or low key.
      5.19.7.2. Description. The ELP is a 360-degree pattern designed to position the aircraft
      for landing for an FL, SFL, or PEL. See Figure 5.7 and Table 5.2.
      5.19.7.3. Airspeed. Maintain 125 KIAS (minimum) clean or 120 KIAS (minimum)
      configured. A higher airspeed may be used while flying the ELP to increase drag and
      decrease energy, but caution must be used to adhere to gear and flap limiting speeds.
86                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


     5.19.7.4. Power:
        5.19.7.4.1. SFL. 4-6 percent torque. Do not adjust power throughout the profile
        unless safety of flight is jeopardized.
        5.19.7.4.2. PEL. Adjust power as required according to the flight manual until on
        profile, 4-6 percent torque on profile.
     5.19.7.5. Procedures:
        5.19.7.5.1. Planning. The primary reference during an ELP is the RWY. Cross-
        check energy level (altitude, airspeed) with position. Look outside to maintain or
        attain proper ground track. Predict energy level (altitude) at known reference points
        (cross key, low key, base key, etc.) and anticipate required corrections.
        5.19.7.5.2. Energy Corrections:
            5.19.7.5.2.1. High Energy:
               5.19.7.5.2.1.1. For an (S)FL, correct for high energy by modifying ELP
               ground track, slipping the aircraft, and/or adding drag devices early.
               5.19.7.5.2.1.2. For a PEL, correct with a power reduction or utilize any of the
               options applicable to an FL.
            5.19.7.5.2.2. Low Energy:
               5.19.7.5.2.2.1. For an (S)FL, correct for low energy by delaying landing gear
               or flap extension, intercepting the ELP at some point other than high key (low
               key, base key, final), and (or) adjusting pattern ground track.
               5.19.7.5.2.2.2. For a PEL, use power to correct for a low-energy state as soon
               as it is recognized (if the severity of an actual engine malfunction allows).
               After correcting back to profile, reset 4-6 percent torque. Note: emphasis
               should be on safely maneuvering the aircraft on proper profile and airspeed,
               versus precisely resetting 4 to 6 percent torque.
        5.19.7.5.3. Ground Track Management. Look outside to maintain or attain proper
        ground track. Position deviations can occur because of poor planning, imprecise
        aircraft control, or improper wind analysis. Trim throughout the ELP to minimize
        airspeed deviations. Make all corrections smooth and expeditious to avoid stall.
     5.19.7.6. High Key Placement:
        5.19.7.6.1. Offset Method. Use approximately one-quarter wingtip distance (WTD)
        displacement from the RWY, away from the intended ELP turn direction. For
        example, if making a right turn out of high key, displace to the left of the RWY
        approaching high key. Place the RWY just above the canopy rail as an approximation
        for one-quarter WTD. The exact amount of displacement is not critical, but the goal is
        to be able to see the RWY to determine high key position.
        5.19.7.6.2. Overhead Method. Establish high key position directly over the RWY.
        If a bank is required to check for position relative to the RWY, use caution to avoid
        drifting in the direction of any potential traffic conflicts.

      5.19.7.7. High to Low Key:
         5.19.7.7.1. If on profile at or prior to high key, lower the landing gear.
         5.19.7.7.2. Turn and use AOB as necessary toward low key:
         5.19.7.7.3. If using offset method: Approximately 20-degree bank - no wind.
         5.19.7.7.4. If using overhead method: Approximately 30-degree bank - no-wind.
      5.19.7.8. Cross Key. Check for 2,200-2,300 feet AGL, with the aircraft approximately
      perpendicular to the landing RWY. If excessively high or low, check for proper power
      setting and (or) configuration. Otherwise, evaluate airspeed, bank angle, and winds to
      determine cause of altitude deviation.

NOTES:
1. If below target altitude on an FL or SFL, delay configuration changes only until on profile. If
below target altitude on a PEL, immediately add power to get back on profile (if the severity of
an actual engine malfunction allows) prior to extending gear or flaps. The goal is to correct
deviations early to arrive at checkpoints on target altitude and in the proper configuration.
2. 3,000 feet AGL is ideal; however, high key may be as low as 2,500 feet AGL.
3. All WTDs are approximate and based on no-wind conditions.
4. Strive to set landing flap setting (LDG) flaps, but use flaps as required to ensure aircraft will
not touch down short of the RWY. Flaps can be lowered after landing is assured or after
touchdown if stopping distance is critical.

5. The intended point of landing is within the first one-third of the RWY with landing flaps
extended, on centerline, touching down on-speed.

       5.19.7.9. Low Key:
           5.19.7.9.1. Located approximately two-thirds WTD (fuel cap on RWY), abeam the
           landing aim point (approximately 500 to 1,000 feet prior to the intended point of
           touchdown--no wind), altitude approximately 1,500 feet AGL and 120 KIAS
           minimum.
           5.19.7.9.2. Approaching low key, cross-check the RWY to evaluate spacing.
           Estimate wind and plan accordingly.
           5.19.7.9.3. At low key, level the wings momentarily and check for proper spacing
           and altitude. Avoid excessive wings level time and use caution if past abeam to the
           last usable landing surface. This is especially important if there will be a strong
           headwind component on final. If energy is assessed to be adequate to make the RWY,
           lower TO flaps.
           5.19.7.9.4. For low to base key, maintain 120 KIAS minimum. The descent rate is
           normally greater than for a normal pattern. Fly the aircraft perpendicular to the RWY
           (base key) at 600-800 feet AGL. Altitude is not the only indication of proper energy
           management; the distance from the RWY must also be assessed and the effect of
           winds taken into account. When landing is assured, lower flaps to LDG.
           5.19.7.9.5. Hold the aim point (500-1,000 feet short of intended landing point--no
           wind) and observe the airspeed. If the airspeed is increasing above 120 KIAS, it is a
           good indication that the energy state is sufficient to reach the landing point. Consider
           the winds and lower LDG flaps.
       5.19.7.10. Final. Intercept final a minimum of 1,000 feet from the intended point of
       touchdown. This allows time for stabilization of descent rate and evaluation of the RWY.
       Aircraft may be slowed to 110 KIAS (minimum) on final. Maintain 110 KIAS
       (minimum) on final until transition to landing. The transition to landing may begin well
       prior to the intended point of touchdown.
       5.19.7.11. Landing. Adjust the nose attitude in the roundout to transition to a normal
       landing. Touchdown on the main gear and then gently lower the nose wheel as in a
       normal landing. Apply braking based on RWY remaining.
           5.19.7.11.1. FL. Anticipate a longer flare and touchdown because of reduced drag.
           Use caution when applying brakes to prevent blown tires. If the aircraft cannot be
           stopped before the EOR, execute the aircraft departs prepared surface checklist or
           eject.

         5.19.7.11.2. SFL. Anticipate a longer flare and touchdown because the PCL is not
         reduced to idle when landing is assured. Reduce the power to idle upon touchdown
         during full-stop landings.
         5.19.7.11.3. PEL. Reduce power to idle after carefully determining that landing is
         assured. If RWY remaining after touchdown is insufficient to stop, go around. If
         sufficient power is available to obtain low key, reattempt PEL. If power is insufficient
         or the engine is not reliable, consider ejection.
  5.19.8. ELP Wind Analysis. Winds can cause ELPs to differ significantly from standard.
  An unanticipated strong wind or one for which there is no appropriate correction made can
  result in an unsuccessful ELP, even if it was otherwise flawlessly flown.
     5.19.8.1. Determining Winds. Surface winds, winds at 1,000 to 3,000 feet, winds at
     5,000 feet and winds aloft should be obtained from WX forecasts and serve as a good
     starting point for building SA about actual wind conditions. The winds at 1,000 to 3,000
     feet can vary significantly from surface winds and significantly alter required ELP
     ground track. At tower or RSU-controlled runways, actual surface winds are known.
     Other ways to determine the winds include:
         5.19.8.1.1. Radio calls to other aircraft, a fixed base operator (FBO) on the field, etc.
         5.19.8.1.2. Without access to actual observations, use winds briefed by WX
         forecaster in the preflight briefing as a starting assumption.
         5.19.8.1.3. If performing an ELP at a non-towered airfield without WX observation
         capability, assume that in the local area, surface winds will be similar to those at the
         home field.
         5.19.8.1.4. Observation of surface conditions: smoke, waves on lakes, wind
         tetrahedron, windsock, etc.
         5.19.8.1.5. Double the surface wind velocity to estimate winds at high key as wind is
         typically stronger at altitude than at the surface.
         5.19.8.1.6. Use GPS groundspeed and cross-track error (flying an OBS course).
     5.19.8.2. Techniques for Wind Correction. Move the high key position into the wind
     1,000 feet for every 10 knots of wind. Start the turn from low key to base key earlier than
     normal and use an aim point closer to the intended point of touchdown. Expect a shorter
     and steeper final. Consider delaying lowering of full flaps a little longer than executed for
     a no-wind condition.
     5.19.8.3. Crosswinds. If there is an option to turn in either direction, consider the
     following:
         5.19.8.3.1. Turning Away from the Wind at High Key. Adjust low key spacing.
         Although there is a tailwind initially, the headwind departing low key allows more
         time for decision making during the last, critical stages of the ELP. Remember ―base,
         wind in your face.‖
         5.19.8.3.2. Turning into the Wind at High Key. Adjust low key spacing. The turn
         from low key will be aided by the crosswind component. Although this compresses
         the time from low key to final, it can provide an extra energy cushion.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   91


     5.19.8.4. Headwinds. Move the high key position into the wind 1,000 feet for every 10
     knots of wind. Start the turn from low key to base key earlier than normal and use an aim
     point closer to the intended point of touchdown. Expect a shorter and steeper final.
     Consider delaying lowering of full flaps a little longer than executed for a no-wind
     condition.
  5.19.9. ELPs Through Weather:
     5.19.9.1. Objective. Perform an ELP through the WX.
     5.19.9.2. Description. Descending through the clouds for an FL requires an evaluation
     of reported ceiling and visibility, RWY length, familiarity with the field, local
     obstructions, minimum safe altitudes, and pilot proficiency. Anytime a WX penetration is
     required, give serious consideration to ejecting instead of attempting an FL through the
     WX. If attempting an FL through the WX, first plan to go to high key for a normal ELP if
     the WX allows for VMC at high key. If the WX will not allow for VMC at high key, two
     methods to use are the standard ELP from high key and the high-speed ELP.
     5.19.9.3. Procedures:
        5.19.9.3.1. ELP from High Key. The concept behind this method is to fly the ELP
        as normally as possible, using the GPS rather than visual references for ground track
        control. Use the GPS to navigate to high key (Figure 5.6). Use the standard 125-knot
        glide and turns as necessary to achieve the appropriate altitude upon reaching high
        key. Assuming there is WX all the way down to 2,000 feet AGL, attempt to maintain
        the standard ELP ground track by turning to achieve a displacement of 0.7 to 1.0
        miles when abeam high key after completing the turn. If VMC is not encountered
        until low key, this method should still place the aircraft fairly close to the proper ELP
        ground track. However, it does not provide any maneuvering capability to correct if
        you are not on the proper ground track. Once VMC is encountered, attempt to
        intercept and maintain the proper ground track visually.
        5.19.9.3.2. High-Speed ELP. The concept behind this method is to arrive just below
        the WX with excess airspeed, which will allow maneuvering to intercept the ELP at
        or prior to an appropriate low key position. Establish a standard 125-knot glide
        toward the GPS data point representing high key and maintain 125 knots until at an
        altitude which is equal to distance to the field plus low key (MSL). For example, if
        the field elevation is 1,000 feet, look for 12,500 feet at 10 miles. Use DME plus low
        key (MSL) for a high speed ELP memory aid. Upon reaching the target altitude, set
        10 degrees NL and descend at 1,000 feet per NM until breaking out of the WX. The
        resulting airspeed could be as high as 230 knots. Once in VMC conditions, level-off
        at a point to stay clear of clouds, assess position, and maneuver to intercept the ELP
        at an appropriate ground track point and altitude. If not clear of clouds by low key
        altitude, seriously consider abandoning the aircraft.
     5.19.9.4. Techniques. If there is a published GPS approach for the RWY selected,
     consider loading that approach and OBS off the missed approach data point to estimate
     high key. (Use RWY bearing as the OBS course.) If no approach is available, estimate
     high key using the airfield as the data point.

     5.19.10.1. Break to Low Key:
        5.19.10.1.1. Objective. A method to practice an ELP starting at low key; usually
        performed when WX precludes starting the maneuver from high key or to expedite
        training.
        5.19.10.1.2. Description. An intentional climbing break turn, commenced in the
        normal break zone, arriving at the low key position, in the normal low key
        configuration.
        5.19.10.1.3. Procedure. On initial, make a radio call to the RSU/tower requesting a
        break to low key.
            5.19.10.1.3.1. When approved by RSU/tower, and according to local procedures,
            reduce power as necessary to make a decelerating, climbing turn toward low key.
            5.19.10.1.3.2. After decelerating below 150 KIAS, lower gear and TO flaps. Use
            power as required to maintain 120 KIAS (minimum) until arriving at low key.
            5.19.10.1.3.3. From low key continue with normal ELP procedures.
     5.19.10.2. Closed to Low Key:
        5.19.10.2.1. Objective. A method to practice an ELP starting at low key; usually
        performed when WX precludes starting the maneuver from high key, or to expedite
        training.
        5.19.10.2.2. Description. A climbing turn to 1,500 feet AGL from initial takeoff,
        touch-and-go landing, or go-around, flown similarly to a closed pull-up. Minimum
        airspeed is 140 KIAS; maximum bank is 90 degrees. Arrive at the low key position,
        in the normal low key configuration.
        5.19.10.2.3. Procedure:
            5.19.10.2.3.1. At 140 KIAS (minimum) and according to local directives, request
            clearance for closed to low key. When approved, clear for traffic, advance the
            PCL smoothly to MAX, and start a climbing turn toward low key, initially using
            approximately 60 degrees of bank.
            5.19.10.2.3.2. Upon reaching 1,500 feet AGL, reduce power (as required),
            confirm proper spacing, and report high downwind per local guidance.
            5.19.10.2.3.3. After slowing below 150 KIAS, lower gear and TO flaps. Use
            power as required to maintain 120 KIAS (minimum) until arriving at low key. At
            low key, set 4 to 6 percent torque and continue with normal ELP procedures.
     5.19.10.3. Zero-Torque ELPs. An ELP flown with excessive prop drag (greater than
     that of a feathered prop) will require more nose-down pitch to maintain airspeed,
     resulting in excessive descent rates and altitude loss. Excessive prop drag may be caused
     by (1) inadvertently setting the PCL to less than 4 percent torque during a PEL or SFL
     training, (2) a mechanical malfunction resulting in an unfeathered prop after engine
     shutdown, or (3) excessive prop drag from a propeller malfunction with a running engine.
     Practicing an ELP with zero torque simulates these conditions.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               93


       5.19.10.3.1. Objective. Demonstrate the effects of excessive prop drag on an ELP,
       and stress the importance of cross-checking power setting during ELP training.
       5.19.10.3.2. Description:
          5.19.10.3.2.1. Airspeed. 120 KIAS (minimum).
          5.19.10.3.2.2. Power:
              5.19.10.3.2.2.1. High Key. Zero percent torque; then power as required to
              arrest descent to low key.
              5.19.10.3.2.2.2. Low Key. Zero percent torque; then power according to go-
              around procedures.
          5.19.10.3.2.3. Gear. Down.
          5.19.10.3.2.4. Flaps. Up at high key; TO at low key.
       5.19.10.3.3. Procedure:
          5.19.10.3.3.1. This demonstration may be conducted by starting from high key or
          low key.
          5.19.10.3.3.2. Fly to normal high key altitude, configure with gear, and set the
          PCL to idle. Notice the pitch attitude required to maintain 120 knots. At the
          halfway point between high key and low key, altitude loss should normally be
          approximately 750 feet. Note the actual loss. If allowed to continue, the altitude
          loss at low key would be excessive. Add power to arrive at low key on altitude.
          5.19.10.3.3.3. Fly to a normal low key, lower flaps to TO, and set power to idle.
          Notice the pitch required to maintain 120 knots and rapid altitude loss. The pitch
          attitude required to maintain 120 knots from low key to final will be significantly
          lower than normal. Because of excessive NL pitch attitudes and descent rates
          throughout the maneuver, initiate a go-around with a minimum of 200 feet AGL
          in accordance with AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3.

                                              Chapter 6

                                           CONTACT

6.1. Introduction. Contact flying develops the skills and techniques necessary for success in
every other type of flying. The use of outside references emphasizes the composite cross-check.
Basic skills, such as checklist use, systems operation, task management, and cockpit organization
are introduced and developed in preparation for more complex sorties. The basic maneuvers
learned and practiced in contact are the basis for all other flying. Furthermore, understanding the
difference between approach to stall conditions and a full aerodynamic stall increases safety in
the traffic pattern and during area work. Instrument training in the aircraft is only accomplished
after the basics of flight are learned in the contact phase. Formation cannot be learned without an
understanding of the advanced maneuvering concepts developed through aerobatic practice.
Energy awareness, position awareness, and overall SA developed in three dimensional contact
maneuvering is universally applicable.
6.2. Checks. Accomplish appropriate checks before performing maneuvers. Checks are not
required between individual maneuvers if flown in a series.
   6.2.1. Tactically, a FENCE check is typically performed when entering or exiting a hostile
   area. It ensures aircraft systems are set for combat. To instill an easily transferable habit
   pattern, during T-6 training, a FENCE check is performed when entering the military
   operations area (MOA) (FENCE-in) and again when leaving the MOA (FENCE-out). In the
   T-6 FENCE stands for:
       6.2.1.1. F - Fuel (balance and quantity).
       6.2.1.2. E - Engine (within limits).
       6.2.1.3. N - NAVAIDs (GPS/EHSI set); N - NACWS (check range setting and clear the
       airspace).
       6.2.1.4. C - Communication (frequencies set, radio call according to local directives).
       Checks complete (climb, ops, pre-stall, spin, aerobatic, descent).
       6.2.1.5. E - Equipment (G-suit test as required, loose items stowed). Emergency airfield
       options reviewed.
   6.2.2. A CLEF check is an excellent memory aid for checklist steps required prior to stalling,
   spinning, or aerobatic maneuvers.
       6.2.2.1. C - Clear the area (also CWS panel clear).
       6.2.2.2. L - Loose items stowed.
       6.2.2.3. E - Engine (within limits).
       6.2.2.4. F - Fuel balance (within 50 pounds).
6.3. Maneuvering at Increased G Loading. During contact flying, especially during
aerobatics, G loading changes constantly. To avoid gray out, blackout, or G-induced loss of
consciousness (GLOC), an effective anti-G straining maneuver is essential. Physical fitness,
adequate rest, and proper hydration can improve G tolerance. The most intense G loading
changes occur during maneuvers that start in a very nose-down attitude at relatively low airspeed
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     95


but transition to high G at increasing airspeeds, such as nose-low recoveries, spin recoveries, and
split-S maneuvers. An effective anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) is essential. Perform a G-
awareness exercise or AGSM demonstration before accomplishing any maneuver that may
require three or more Gs.
   6.3.1. Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM). Accomplish the AGSM by firmly contracting
   muscles of the legs, abdomen, and chest. As the amount of G increases, increase the intensity
   of the strain, and attempt to exhale through a closed airway. Continue to strain and
   simultaneously breathe approximately every 2 to 3 seconds. Think of the AGSM as a
   continuum. As the amount of G increases, increase the intensity of the strain and pay careful
   attention to proper breathing technique. Do not hold the strain too long (more than 3 seconds)
   without breathing as this reduces G tolerance. If gray out occurs at the onset of G forces,
   application of the AGSM may not eliminate the gray out. If altitude or airspeed are not
   critical, return to 1 G flight, reapply the anti-G strain, and then continue maneuvering. Use
   caution not to exceed aircraft or personal G limits.
       6.3.1.1. AGSM Effectiveness. It is important to start the AGSM before the onset of G
       forces and maintain the strain throughout the period of increased G loading. The amount
       of strain required varies with the amount of applied G force. An effective AGSM uses
       full muscle contraction and keeps constant breathing cycles. Lower G situations still
       require all elements of a full AGSM but at a lower level of strain intensity.
       6.3.1.2. AGSM Demonstration. The AGSM demonstration allows practice of the anti-
       G strain technique and familiarization with increased G loading in a controlled setting.
       The demonstration consists of a series of turns, each at a constant G level, with a break
       between turns for critique and rest. The maneuver is flown at gradually increasing G
       levels, starting at 2 Gs and increasing to 4 Gs, depending on proficiency. If, at any time,
       personal G-tolerance limits are approached, inform the other crewmember. The
       demonstration should be of sufficient duration to ensure a proper AGSM. The AGSM
       cycle should last from 10 to 15 seconds with at least four or five breathing cycles.
   6.3.2. G-Awareness Exercise. Accomplish a G-awareness exercise on sorties that include
   maneuvers that require or may result in 3 or more Gs.
       6.3.2.1. The G-awareness exercise should be a level or slightly descending turn, using
       maximum power. Begin the maneuver with sufficient airspeed to sustain 4 Gs. (For
       planning purposes, use approximately 200 to 220 knots minimum for a level to slightly
       descending turn where the nose remains within 10 degrees of the horizon.) The G-onset
       rate should be slow and smooth, allowing sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of
       the AGSM and determine G tolerance. Increase Gs to approximately 4 Gs and maintain
       for approximately four or five breathing cycles in order to allow full cardiovascular
       response.
       6.3.2.2. For advanced aerobatic and formation training, the G-awareness exercise should
       be flown to G loads of 4 to 5 Gs.
       6.3.2.3. If gray out begins during the demonstration, return to 1-G flight, reevaluate the
       strain, and then smoothly reenter the G-awareness exercise.
       6.3.2.4. If personal G tolerance is deemed insufficient for the sortie, terminate high-G
       maneuvering and consider terminating the mission.

6.4. Area Orientation (Figure 6.1.) Visual ground references such as cities, lakes, road
intersections, terrain, etc., are the primary means of maintaining area orientation. When visual
references are inadequate, or to augment visual orientation, the GPS or VOR with DME may be
used. A good composite cross-check of ground references verified by instruments is an effective
way to maintain or build SA.

Figure 6.1. Area Orientation.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    97


   6.4.1. VOR/DME. Area boundaries are sometimes defined with VOR radial and DME.
   There are two primary methods to maintain area orientation that utilize VOR or DME.
       6.4.1.1. Center Radial (Course) Method. Set the center radial or center course of the
       area in the course selector window (CSW) of the EHSI. When center radial is set, the
       course arrow points away from the NAVAID; when center course is set, the course arrow
       points toward the NAVAID. The center of the area (laterally) is always toward the course
       deviation indicator (CDI). This method is best suited for areas that are 20 radials wide or
       less.
       6.4.1.2. Pie-in-the-Sky Method. Best used in wide areas (20 radials wide or more). Set
       one boundary (course) in the CSW and mark the other boundary (course) with the
       heading marker. Keep the head of the bearing pointer, which always falls, between the
       head of the course arrow and the heading marker. In Figure 6.1, if heading remains
       constant, the aircraft will exit the area because of the DME range. A left turn to
       approximately 130 degrees makes the bearing pointer fall toward the 046-degree course
       and makes the DME decrease.
   6.4.2. EFIS and GPS Display Options. There are various possible configurations for the
   EFIS and GPS. Normally, a typical display setup is used until proficiency is demonstrated
   (the Super Nav 5 page of the GPS control head in conjunction with the VOR and visual
   references). After demonstrating proficiency, other display options may be used to optimize
   SA and precise control of the aircraft. These include using the EFIS GPS map mode on the
   horizontal situation indicator (HSI). The arc mode may also be utilized to provide a more
   detailed picture.
6.5. Energy Management. Efficient energy management allows the sortie profile to be
accomplished with minimum wasted time and fuel. Energy level is defined by airspeed (kinetic
energy) and altitude (potential energy) and is manipulated with power, drag, and G loading. Plan
maneuvers in an order that minimizes the requirement for deliberate energy changes, and make
use of the inherent energy gaining or losing properties of individual maneuvers.
   6.5.1. Altitude and Airspeed Exchange. Potential energy (altitude) and kinetic energy
   (airspeed) can be traded; for example, 1,000 feet of altitude equals approximately 50 knots of
   airspeed with the canopy bow on the horizon and power at maximum. Techniques include:
       6.5.1.1. Altitude for Airspeed. MAX power with the canopy bow on the horizon.
       6.5.1.2. Airspeed for Altitude. MAX power, wings level, and clock on the horizon.
   6.5.2. Optimum Energy Level. In a typical MOA, optimum energy for aerobatic
   maneuvering is 180 to 200 KIAS at an altitude midway between the top and bottom area
   limits. Energy planning may need to be altered if the airspace is limited by WX, ATC
   restrictions, or other limiting factors.
   6.5.3. Losing Energy. Energy may be decreased with low power settings, increased drag
   (e.g., speed brake), or increased AOA (G loading). A simple way to lose energy is to perform
   a constant speed descent until the desired energy level is reached.
   6.5.4. Gaining Energy. Energy gain is enhanced with low AOA (avoid flight near zero G)
   and high power. The best method to gain large amounts of energy is a climb at 140 to160
   KIAS with MAX power.
 98                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   6.5.5. Energy Planning. Individual maneuvers are energy gainers, energy losers, or neutral.
   Energy losers include spin, traffic pattern stalls, cloverleaf, split-S, nose-low recovery ELP
   stalls, and high G turns with lower power settings. Energy gainers include power-on stalls,
   nose-high recovery, stability demonstration, and Chandelle. Constant awareness of total
   energy state aids in correct maneuver selection and effective profile management, which
   allows a smooth flow between maneuvers with minimum delay. For example, airspeed
   exiting a Cuban Eight will be very close to entry airspeed for a loop. Another example: if
   trying to exit the area for return to base (RTB) at the bottom of the area, have sufficient
   energy near the end of the profile to accomplish ELP stalls as the last item. ELP stalls lose
   energy, and the lower altitude and slow airspeed at the completion of the maneuver may help
   expedite recovery.
6.6. Power-On Stalls:
   6.6.1. Objective. Proper recognition of a full aerodynamic stall. Proper recovery with
   minimum loss of altitude. Recognizing secondary stall if entered and properly recovering.
   Note: T-6A training focuses on recognizing actual stall buffet during the recovery. Recovery
   on the artificial stall indication (stick shaker) is not an objective of phase II stall recovery.
   6.6.2. Description. Aircraft pitch and bank angle held constant until control effectiveness
   lost indicated by uncommanded nose drop or unplanned rolling motion. Recover to a wings
   level, climbing attitude. An entry speed of 160 KIAS results in about 1,500-2,000 feet
   altitude gain.
      6.6.2.1. Airspeed. As required to achieve briefed entry parameters.
      6.6.2.2. Power. Entry: 30 to 60 percent torque. Recovery: MAX.
      6.6.2.3. Pitch. Entry: 15 to 40 degrees NH.
      6.6.2.4. Bank. 0 degrees for straight-ahead stall, 20 to 30 degrees for a turning stall.
      6.6.2.5. FCP Visual Reference, Entry. Crook of front windscreen on horizon.
      6.6.2.6. FCP Visual Reference, Recovery. Initially firelight on horizon, then as
      required to MAX perform aircraft.
   6.6.3. Procedure. Clear the area. Pay particular attention to the area above and in front of
   the aircraft.
      6.6.3.1. Straight-Ahead Stall. Raise the nose to a pitch attitude between 15 degrees and
      40 degrees. Adjust the PCL to 30 to 60 percent torque prior to first indication of stall.
      Maintain attitude using increasing back pressure. Keep the wings level with coordinated
      rudder and aileron. Initiate recovery when control effectiveness is lost. An uncommanded
      nose drop, despite increased back pressure, or an uncommanded rolling motion indicates
      loss of control effectiveness. Do not attempt to maintain pitch attitude or bank angle after
      control effectiveness is lost. Full back stick may not occur before recovery is required.
          6.6.3.1.1. To recover, simultaneously and smoothly relax back stick forces as
          necessary to break the stall, advance the PCL to MAX, and use coordinated rudder
          and aileron to level the wings. As AOA decreases and stall is broken, positive
          pressure is felt in the controls. Minimize altitude loss by maintaining recovery AOA
          until recovery is complete. While the recovery AOA is approximately 15.5 to 18
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       99


           units, the primary reference for maintaining recovery AOA is a positive, vertical nose
           track. Recover with a minimum loss of altitude. Recovery is complete when the
           aircraft is wings level, safely climbing and accelerating.
           6.6.3.1.2. At lower pitch attitudes (between 15 and 30 degrees), the aircraft stalls at a
           higher airspeed and regains flying airspeed faster. At higher pitch attitudes (between
           30 and 40 degrees), the stall speed is slower and a greater pitch reduction is necessary
           to regain flying airspeed.
       6.6.3.2. Turning Power-On Stall. Setup is the same as the straight-ahead stall, except
       20 to 30 degrees of bank in either direction is added. Hold the bank angle with rudder and
       aileron pressure until control effectiveness is lost. Recovery is the same as for the
       straight-ahead stall. A precision entry is not as important as proper recognition and
       recovery from the stall.
   6.6.4. Techniques:
       6.6.4.1. Use ―MAX, relax, roll,‖ to guide initial recovery actions.
       6.6.4.2. After actions to break the stall, pull nose up until the firelight is on the horizon.
       If the nose begins to stop tracking before the firelight reaches the horizon, momentarily
       release back pressure slightly to let airspeed increase and avoid a secondary stall. As
       power and airspeed increase, increased back pressure is needed to establish a climb.
6.7. ELP Stalls. ELP stalls are flown to practice recovery from potentially dangerous low
airspeed conditions before high key and during the ELP. Speed may decrease for various reasons
including inattention, task saturation, and attempts to stretch the glide to regain profile. A full
series of ELP stalls may take up to approximately 4,000 feet.
   6.7.1. Objective. Proper recognition and recovery from approach-to-stall indications during
   an ELP, without the ability to use power to facilitate recovery.
   6.7.2. Description. Inadvertent airspeed decay is simulated at three points in the ELP:
   enroute to high key, between high and low key, and between low key and RWY.
       6.7.2.1. Airspeed. Clean, 125 KIAS. Configured, 120 KIAS.
       6.7.2.2. Power. 4 to 6 percent torque.
       6.7.2.3. FCP Visual Reference (Recovery). Clean, one-half prop arc on the horizon.
       Configured, prop arc on the horizon.
   6.7.3. Procedure:
       6.7.3.1. Glide to High Key. Establish glide at 125 KIAS with wings level and power set
       4 to 6 percent torque. Raise the pitch attitude slightly and allow airspeed to decay until
       the gear warning horn sounds (approximately 120 KIAS). Recover by lowering the pitch
       attitude slightly below the normal glide picture. Reestablish glide at 125 KIAS. Altitude
       loss is approximately 300 feet.
       6.7.3.2. Glide Between High and Low Key. Configure with gear down and flaps UP.
       Establish a 120 KIAS glide with 30 degrees bank and power set to 4 to 6 percent torque.
       Raise pitch attitude (approximately level flight turn picture) and allow airspeed to decay
       until the stick shaker is activated or an approach-to-stall indication is noted. Maintain the
 100                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       turn or profile ground track and recover by lowering the pitch attitude to put the prop arc
       on the horizon (approximately 8 degrees NL) until 120 KIAS regained. Altitude loss is
       approximately 800 feet.
       6.7.3.3. Glide Between Low Key and the Runway. Configure with gear down and
       flaps TO. Establish a 120 KIAS glide with 30-degree bank turn and power set to 4 to 6
       percent torque. Raise pitch attitude (approximately level flight turn picture) and allow
       airspeed to decay until the stick shaker is activated or an approach-to-stall indication is
       noted. Maintain the turn or profile ground track and recover by lowering pitch attitude to
       put the prop arc on the horizon (approximately 8 degrees NL) until 120 KIAS regained.
       Altitude loss is approximately 900 feet. Note: Because of altitude loss during a recovery,
       if an ELP stall between low key and the RWY is encountered during an actual FL,
       consider ejecting.
6.8. Traffic Pattern Stalls. In the traffic pattern, unrecoverable stall or sink rate situations can
occur before indications become obvious. If a stall indication occurs in the traffic pattern,
disregard ground track, and recover as described below. If in the pattern, do not hesitate to eject
if recovery appears unlikely.
   6.8.1. Objective. Proper recognition of, and recovery from, approach-to-stall conditions in
   the traffic pattern. Training emphasis is on recognition of approach-to-stall indications and
   appropriate recovery procedures, not on setup or flow from one stall to the next. However,
   much like power-on stalls, the smoother the entry, the cleaner the stall will be.
   6.8.2. Description. This exercise simulates five possible traffic pattern errors and practices
   the appropriate recovery actions: an overshooting (NL), accelerated stall simulating
   overshooting crosswinds or improper perch spacing; an undershooting stall simulating a
   combination of inadvertently placing the PCL to idle (zero torque) and poor airspeed
   crosscheck; a landing attitude stall simulating an improper landing assured decision (PCL to
   idle) or improperly flown roundout and flare; a break turn stall simulating a exaggerated
   aggressive break; and a closed pull-up stall simulating an exaggerated, aggressive pull-up
   with poor airspeed and altitude crosscheck. The latter two stalls, the break turn and closed
   pull-up stalls are to be practiced in the simulator only.
       6.8.2.1. Airspeed:
           6.8.2.1.1. Final turn setups, 120 KIAS (minimum).
           6.8.2.1.2. Landing attitude setup, 5 to 10 knots above final approach airspeed
           commensurate with flap setting.
       6.8.2.2. Power:
           6.8.2.2.1. Final Turn Setup. 10 to 15 percent torque.
           6.8.2.2.2. To Induce Stall. Zero percent torque.
           6.8.2.2.3. Recovery. MAX.
       6.8.2.3. Gear. Down.
       6.8.2.4. Flaps. LDG, TO, and UP.
       6.8.2.5. Bank:

         6.8.2.5.1. Initial Turn. 30 degrees.
         6.8.2.5.2. Landing Attitude Stall. 0 degrees.
  6.8.3. Procedures. For all traffic pattern stalls, recover on approach-to-stall indication,
  which is considered to be activation of the stick shaker or aircraft buffet, whichever occurs
  first.
     6.8.3.1. Overshooting (Nose Low) Final-Turn Stall. Fly a simulated downwind leg,
     configure for an overhead pattern, and perform the before-landing checklist. At 120
     KIAS minimum, initiate a normal final turn. After the turn is established, retard the PCL
     to idle, steadily increase bank and back pressure to simulate a steep, overshooting final
     turn. To recover, simultaneously and smoothly relax back stick forces as necessary to
     alleviate the approach to stall indication, advance the PCL to MAX, and use coordinated
     rudder and aileron to level the wings. Disregard pattern ground track. Minimize altitude
     loss by maintaining recovery AOA until recovery is complete. While the recovery AOA
     is approximately 15.5 to 18 units, the primary reference for maintaining recovery AOA is
     a positive, vertical nose track. Recovery is complete when the aircraft is wings level and
     safely climbing.
     6.8.3.2. Undershooting (Nose High) Final-Turn Stall. Fly a simulated downwind leg,
     configure for an overhead pattern, and perform the before landing checklist. At 120 KIAS
     minimum, initiate a normal final turn. After the turn is established, retard the PCL to idle,
     raise the nose slightly, and shallow out the bank. Continue the turn until achieving an
     approach-to-stall indication. Recovery is the same as for the overshooting final-turn stall;
     however, since airspeed is initially lower, recovery takes slightly longer.
     6.8.3.3. Landing Attitude Stall. Establish a simulated final approach at 5 to 10 knots
     above final approach airspeed commensurate with flap setting. Retard the PCL to idle and
     execute a simulated roundout for landing. Hold the landing attitude constant until an
     approach-to-stall indication occurs. Recovery is the same as the final turn stalls.
     6.8.3.4. Closed Pull-Up Stall (Simulator Training Only). On departure leg, with 140
     KIAS, roll and pull, simulating an overly aggressive closed pattern. At the first approach-
     to-stall indication, recover by reducing back stick pressure and rapidly rolling wings level
     with rudder and aileron. A reduction in power may be necessary during a left closed
     pattern. If the aircraft departs controlled flight, eject.
     6.8.3.5. Break Stall (Simulator Training Only). At 200 KIAS, retard the PCL to
     approximately 10 percent torque and enter a 60-degree bank turn. Midway through the
     turn, increase the bank and back stick pressure until an approach-to-stall indication is
     recognized. Recover by using stick forces as necessary to decrease the AOA. Adjust the
     bank angle as necessary and continue the turn to a simulated downwind leg.
  6.8.4. Technique:
     6.8.4.1. Use ―MAX, relax, roll‖ to guide initial recovery actions.
     6.8.4.2. Propeller and gyroscopic effects will force the nose to the left when the power is
     increased from idle to MAX at slow speed. Counter the tendency of the nose to move to
     the left by using right rudder as torque increases. Find a point far in front of the aircraft
     and use right rudder to keep the nose from moving left. Anticipate left nose movement to
 102                                                          AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       start approximately two seconds after moving the PCL to MAX. The slower the airspeed
       at recovery, the more pronounced the yaw will be at engine spool up.
6.9. Secondary Stall. During stall training, a common recovery error is entering a secondary
stall. This is the result of an overly aggressive return to level flight after a stall or spin recovery.
Encountering a secondary stall demonstrates the value of smooth back pressure and the
importance of obtaining flying airspeed during the stall recovery. Avoid secondary stalls, but if
encountered, release back pressure slightly to decrease AOA, allow the airspeed to increase, and
then resume the recovery.
6.10. Slow Flight:
   6.10.1. Objective. Familiarization and proficiency with aircraft performance and
   characteristics at minimum flying airspeed. Demonstrate importance of smooth control
   application at slow speeds. Validate the concept of coordinated turns.
   6.10.2. Description:
       6.10.2.1. Airspeed. Flaps landing, 80 to 85 KIAS; Flaps TO, 85 to 90 KIAS; Flaps UP,
       90 to -95 KIAS.
       6.10.2.2. Gear. Down.
       6.10.2.3. Flaps. As desired.
   6.10.3. Procedure. Slow flight is conveniently flown before or after traffic pattern stalls;
   however, slow flight may be performed at any time. Slow below 150 KIAS, configure the
   aircraft as briefed, and perform the before landing checklist. Maintain altitude as airspeed
   decreases. When target slow flight airspeed is reached, adjust power to maintain airspeed and
   altitude. Trim as required. Execute a coordination exercise as described in paragraph
   6.10.3.1.2. The coordination exercise, coupled with several other slow flight demonstrations,
   are found in the SCATSAFE maneuvers explained in paragraph 6.10.3.1. Approach-to-stall
   indications (stick shaker or light buffet) are common while executing slow flight; however, if
   the aircraft actually stalls during slow flight, recover the aircraft by alleviating the condition
   that caused the stall (decrease the AOA, lower the flaps, decrease bank, etc.). This is not the
   primary method of stall recovery and is used only during slow flight. If the stall condition is
   not immediately corrected, or if an approach-to-stall indication occurs at any other time,
   initiate traffic pattern stall recovery procedures.
       6.10.3.1. SCATSAFE Maneuver:
           6.10.3.1.1. S - Straight and Level. During operation on the back side of the power
           curve, increased AOA results in increased drag and a stall if not carefully flown. Note
           the pitch attitude, torque, and rudder deflection required to maintain straight-and-level
           flight. This is the picture a pilot should see at rotation during takeoff or just prior to
           touchdown during landing.
           6.10.3.1.2. C – Coordination Exercise. Conduct a series of left and right turns,
           using 15- to 20-degrees of bank. Keep the ball centered using coordinated rudder.
           Approximately two inches of right rudder is required to maintain straight-and-level,
           coordinated flight. Right turns require approximately twice the rudder deflection to
           maintain coordination. Left turns require approximately one-half inch of right rudder
           to maintain coordination.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  103


       6.10.3.1.3. A - Adverse Yaw. A lack of coordinated rudder during a turn results in
       weaving or ―S-ing‖ on final. Select two points: one directly in front of the aircraft,
       and one approximately 20 degrees to the right of the nose. Without applying rudder,
       initiate a rapid right turn with 20-degree bank. Note the initial tendency of the nose to
       yaw left. After approximately 20 degrees of turn, roll out rapidly without using
       rudder. The nose continues past the selected rollout point then comes back. Next,
       initiate a right turn, using coordinated rudder. Notice that the nose immediately tracks
       in a coordinated manner. After 20 degrees of turn, roll out using properly coordinated
       rudder and note that the nose stops on the selected rollout point.
       6.10.3.1.4. T - Torque and Turns. The T-6 initially tends to pitch up, yaw, and roll
       left if positive control is not maintained during full power takeoffs and landings. To
       demonstrate this, quickly increase power to MAX from straight-and-level,
       coordinated slow flight and release the controls. The nose tracks up, yaws, and rolls
       left, and approaches a stall. Recover from the buffet, prior to stall. Reestablish slow
       flight and increase power to MAX again. This time, hold proper takeoff pitch and
       apply coordinated rudder to maintain a proper nose track. Positive control of the
       aircraft ensures safe takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, and go-arounds.
       6.10.3.1.5. S - Steep Turns. High angles of bank at slow airspeeds increase stall
       speed and cause rapid turn rates. Slowly increase bank toward 60 degrees while
       adding power and back pressure to maintain level flight. Look at a point on the
       ground and watch the wingtip appear to pivot around the selected point. The AOA
       quickly increases, progressing into a stall. Roll out of the bank to recover from the
       impending stall.
       6.10.3.1.6. A - Abrupt Control Movement. Fixation on the aim point during
       landing can cause an abrupt flare. Late recognition of the rapidly approaching RWY
       causes the pilot to abruptly raise the nose of the aircraft, causing an approach-to-stall
       condition, a hard landing, or both. The stick shaker activates, but there is no decrease
       in sink rate. To demonstrate this, abruptly apply back stick pressure to 20 degrees NH
       to simulate snatching the control stick in the flare. The AOA rapidly increases and the
       aircraft progresses toward a full stall. Release back pressure to recover. To avoid this
       condition on landing, view the total landing environment and apply controls in a
       smooth, positive manner.
       6.10.3.1.7. F - Flap Retraction. Flap retraction prior to the recommended airspeeds
       causes the aircraft to lose lift and develop a sink rate. From straight-and-level
       coordinated slow flight, raise the flaps from landing to UP without pausing at the TO
       position. While retracting the flaps, increase the pitch attitude to maintain altitude.
       Initially airspeed increases (due to reduced drag as flaps begin to retract), but as flaps
       retract toward UP, the AOA increases and a stall results. Recover from the stall by
       selecting landing flaps.
       6.10.3.1.8. E – Effectiveness of Controls. Rapid control inputs, especially in the
       flare, often do not give the aircraft sufficient time to respond. Move the ailerons with
       small, rapid movements. Notice that even with aileron movement, there is little effect
       on heading or bank during slow flight. In slow flight, smooth, positive inputs are
 104                                                            AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


            required to effectively control the aircraft as there is less airflow over the control
            surfaces at slow airspeeds.
6.11. Stability Demonstration. The stability demonstration shows the low speed flight
characteristics of the aircraft in extreme attitudes. Although airspeed is below level-flight stall
speed, the aircraft will not stall if there is no attempt to attain level flight. In addition, the aircraft
will not depart controlled flight (spin) if not stalled.
    6.11.1. Objective. Demonstrate that the aircraft will not stall, regardless of airspeed, if there
    is no demand placed on it.
    6.11.2. Description:
        6.11.2.1. Airspeeds. Entry, 160 KIAS; recovery, 80 KIAS or stick shaker.
        6.11.2.2. Power. Entry, 60 percent torque; recovery, idle.
        6.11.2.3. Attitude. Raise the nose to 40 to 45 degrees pitch attitude wings level.
        6.11.2.4. Altitude Required. 2,000 feet above entry.
        6.11.2.5. Recover. Select idle power and neutralize controls, avoid 0 +/- 0.25 Gs.
    6.11.3. Procedure. Perform pre-stall (CLEF) checks. Accelerate to 160 KIAS, set 60
    percent torque, and clear the area. Raise the nose to a 45-degree pitch attitude. Maintain
    coordinated wings-level flight. Hold this attitude until flying airspeed is depleted to
    approximately 80 KIAS, or stick shaker activation, whichever occurs first. Recover by
    selecting idle power and neutralizing all controls. Allow the nose to lower until positive
    pressure is felt on the controls. This indicates the aircraft is regaining flying airspeed.
    Recover to level flight without stalling the aircraft. The maneuver is complete when the
    aircraft is returned to level flight. Avoid near zero-G flight for more than 5 seconds due to
    engine operating limitations.
    6.11.4. Technique. Estimate 45 degrees NH by visualizing the feet on the horizon. Use
    memory aid ―idle-ize, neutralize‖ to guide recovery actions at 80 KIAS (or stick shaker).
    Cross-check the G meter and maintain slightly more than 0.25 Gs with a small amount of
    back pressure on the control stick to avoid exceeding engine operating limits.
6.12. Inadvertent Departure from Controlled Flight. Section 6 of the flight manual contains
detailed information about departures from controlled flight. Additional information and details
on the recovery procedure are found in section 3 of the flight manual. In the flight manual,
departures from controlled flight are also referred to as out of control flight (OCF), the term used
in this manual. Eject if it appears the aircraft is not recovering by minimum uncontrolled ejection
altitude (6,000 feet AGL).
    6.12.1. The aircraft is in OCF if it does not respond immediately and in a normal manner to
    control inputs. If in OCF, apply the boldface recovery procedure (OCF recovery) to return
    the aircraft to level flight. In all cases, observe the minimum uncontrolled ejection altitude.
    The OCF recovery is accomplished by simultaneously reducing the PCL to idle, positively
    neutralizing the flight controls, and checking the altitude. After the controls are neutralized,
    expect the nose to lower as the aircraft seeks to regain flying airspeed. Initially, aircraft
    control authority is minimal, but it returns to normal as airspeed increases in the dive. Allow
    the nose to lower until positive control pressure is felt. The nose may near the vertical during
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     105


   this stage of the recovery. Upon regaining flying airspeed, recover the aircraft to level flight.
   An unloaded recovery may result in considerable altitude loss.
   6.12.2. The OCF recovery is also used when the aircraft is in a nose-high unusual attitude,
   and SA is lost to the point of disorientation. Depending on flight parameters when SA is lost,
   the initial steps of the OCF recovery procedure either start the recovery or prevent departure.
   In either case, the OCF recovery provides a guaranteed predictable method to return to level
   flight and regain SA.
6.13. Intentional Spin Entry (Emphasizing Departure Recognition and Recovery). The
emphasis in primary pilot training is on departure from controlled flight recognition and
recovery. On most contact sorties where OCF recoveries are performed, recovery will be
initiated within one turn of the application of rudder. Recovery will utilize OCF recovery
procedures.
   6.13.1. Objectives. Recognize what it looks and feels like when an aircraft departs
   controlled flight. Practice the OCF recovery from an intentional departure from controlled
   flight. Increase confidence in ability to recover from the OCF condition in case of inadvertent
   OCF. Maintain SA and ability to function effectively in unusual attitudes.
   6.13.2. Description. Due to the potential for aeration of the oil system during spin entry, do
   not push to less than 1 G or allow the aircraft to sink before intentionally entering a spin.
   Allow 5 seconds of stabilized 1-G flight prior to spin entry.
      6.13.2.1. Airspeeds. Initiate entry, 120 KIAS (minimum); spin entry, approximately 80
      KIAS.
      6.13.2.2. Power. Idle.
      6.13.2.3. Pitch. 15 to 40 degrees.
      6.13.2.4. Flight controls at spin entry:
          6.13.2.4.1. Rudder. Full deflection in spin direction.
          6.13.2.4.2. Elevator. Full aft stick.
          6.13.2.4.3. Ailerons. Neutral.
   6.13.3. Procedure:
      6.13.3.1. Accomplish pre-spin (CLEF) checks and adhere to restrictions according to
      AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3.
      6.13.3.2. Attain level flight at a minimum of 120 KIAS. Raise the nose to 15 to 40
      degrees NH, reduce the PCL to idle, and maintain approximately 1 G. Silence the gear
      warning horn during deceleration.
      6.13.3.3. At spin entry airspeed (approximately 80 KIAS), the pitch attitude should be
      15to 40 degrees NH. Apply full rudder in the desired direction of spin. Position the
      control stick full aft, ailerons neutral, and apply full rudder in the direction of spin.
      6.13.3.4. Initiate OCF recovery procedure within one turn of the application of rudder.
      6.13.3.4.1. Ensure the PCL has been reduced to idle.
          6.13.3.4.2. Position all flight controls to neutral position.
 106                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


          6.13.3.4.3. Check altitude and recover from dive to level flight.
   6.13.4. Technique:
       6.13.4.1. Use memory aid ―idle-ize, neutralize‖ to guide recovery actions.
       6.13.4.2. Verbalize altitude and oil pressure before advancing the PCL.
6.14. Intentional Spin Entry (Emphasizing Near Steady State Spin Recognition and
Recovery). Recoveries from these spins will utilize OCF recovery procedures and be initiated
from a near steady state spin (between two and four turns from rudder application).
   6.14.1. Objectives. The purpose of this spin training is to experience the characteristics of,
   and recovery from, an aircraft in near steady state spin. The emphasis should be on spin
   characteristics (18 plus AOA, turn needle deflection, almost constant airspeed and rotation
   rate) not just counting turns. Additional objectives are to increase confidence in the ability to
   recover from a spinning condition in case of inadvertent OCF, maintain SA and function
   effectively in unusual attitudes.
   6.14.2. Description. Due to the potential for aeration of the oil system during spin entry, do
   not push to less than 1 G or allow the aircraft to sink before intentionally entering a spin.
   Allow 5 seconds of stabilized 1-G flight prior to spin entry.
       6.14.2.1. Airspeeds. Initiate entry, 120 KIAS (minimum); spin entry, approximately 80
       KIAS.
       6.14.2.2. Power. Idle.
       6.14.2.3. Pitch. 15 to 40 degrees.
       6.14.2.4. Flight Controls at Spin Entry:
          6.14.2.4.1. Rudder. Full deflection in spin direction.
          6.14.2.4.2. Elevator. Full aft stick.
          6.14.2.4.3. Ailerons. Neutral.
   6.14.3. Procedure:
       6.14.3.1. Accomplish pre-spin checks and adhere to restrictions according to AFI 11-2T-
       6, Volume 3.
       6.14.3.2. Attain level flight at 120 KIAS (minimum). Raise the nose to 15-40 degrees
       NH, reduce the PCL to idle, and maintain approximately 1 G. Silence the gear warning
       horn during deceleration.
       6.14.3.3. At spin entry airspeed (approximately 80 KIAS), the pitch attitude should be 15
       to 40 degrees NH. Apply full rudder in the desired direction of spin. Control stick should
       be full aft (ailerons neutral) and rudder should be full in the direction of spin.
       6.14.3.4. Initiate OCF recovery procedure within two to four turns of the application of
       rudder.
       6.14.3.4.1. Ensure the PCL has been reduced to idle.
          6.14.3.4.2. Position all flight controls to neutral position.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    107


          6.14.3.4.3. Check altitude and recover from dive to level flight.
   6.14.4. Technique:
       6.14.4.1. Use memory aid ―idle-ize, neutralize‖ to guide recovery actions.
       6.14.4.2. Verbalize altitude and oil pressure before advancing the PCL.
6.15. Contact Recoveries from Abnormal Flight. Recovery may be required due to an
improperly flown maneuver, disorientation, area boundaries (lateral or vertical), an aircraft
malfunction, or traffic conflicts.
   6.15.1. Nose-High Recovery:
       6.15.1.1. Objective. Expeditious return to level flight from a nose-high attitude, without
       departing controlled flight or exceeding aircraft limits.
       6.15.1.2. Description. T-6 aerobatics require nose-high attitudes. A nose-high attitude
       can be encountered with insufficient airspeed to continue the maneuver. Immediate and
       proper recovery procedures prevent aggravated stall and spin.
       6.15.1.3. Procedure. Set power to MAX (or as required for low airspeed situations) and
       initiate a coordinated roll with back pressure to bring the nose of the aircraft down to the
       nearest horizon. Depending on initial airspeed and aircraft attitude, a wings-level,
       inverted attitude may be reached. As the nose approaches the horizon, roll to an upright
       attitude (Figure 6.2).
          6.15.1.3.1. During some nose-high, low-airspeed situations, when the aircraft
          responds to inputs slowly due to low airspeed or torque effect, a reduction in power
          may be required (usually below 60 percent torque) and all available control authority
          may be required to smoothly return the aircraft to level flight. If the aircraft does not
          respond normally, or if SA is lost, an OCF recovery should be accomplished.
 108                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 6.2. Nose-High Recovery.




          6.15.1.3.2. If the airspeed is low, the rollout may be delayed until the nose is
          definitely below the horizon. In some cases, the nose has to be flown well below the
          horizon to regain enough airspeed to feel positive pressure on the controls. When
          airspeed is sufficient, roll wings level, raise the nose, check for normal oil pressure,
          and use power as required to recover to level flight.
          6.15.1.3.3. Do not be too aggressive when pulling to the horizon or pulling up from a
          nose-low attitude. The stick shaker and airframe buffet indicate a potential for stall.
          Decrease back stick pressure before entering a stall.
          6.15.1.3.4. In all cases, observe system limitations when operating near zero G.
          6.15.1.3.5. Do not recover by pushing the nose down toward the horizon. This could
          induce a state of less than one G flight, causing the oil pressure to decrease below
          operational limits. Furthermore, this improper action may delay the time it takes to
          get the nose below the horizon and airspeed increasing again, leading to a possible
          loss of controlled flight with the torque at MAX and rapidly decreasing airspeed.
   6.15.2. Nose-Low Recovery:
       6.15.2.1. Objective. Expeditious recovery to level flight from a nose-low attitude with
       minimum altitude loss and without exceeding aircraft limits.
       6.15.2.2. Description. T-6 aerobatics require nose-low attitudes. Immediate and proper
       recovery procedures prevent a high-speed dive or excessive G forces.
       6.15.2.3. Procedure. Roll the aircraft toward the nearest horizon, level the wings, then
       pull-up to obtain level flight. (Figure 6.3) using up to the maximum allowable G force.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        109


      Use power and speed brake as required. Do not exceed maximum allowable airspeed
      (316 KIAS). Airspeed may continue to increase as the nose is raised, and maximum
      airspeed can occur just before level flight is attained. G loading increases during
      recovery. Accomplish a proper AGSM.
      6.15.2.4. Technique. Approaching 200 KIAS or greater, select idle and speed brake.

Figure 6.3. Nose-Low Recovery.




   6.15.3. Inverted Recovery:
      6.15.3.1. Procedure. When inverted, or near an inverted position, recover by rolling in
      the shortest direction to set the aircraft in an upright, wings-level attitude, adding power
      as required.
      6.15.3.2. Technique: Roll to the ―nearest blue.‖
6.16. Aerobatics:
   6.16.1. Aerobatic maneuvers develop techniques for obtaining maximum flight performance
   from the aircraft. Aerobatics explore the entire performance envelope of the aircraft and
   should be smoothly executed. Aerobatic practice improves feel for the aircraft and the ability
   to coordinate the flight controls, while remaining oriented, regardless of attitude. Aerobatics
   increase confidence, familiarize the pilot with all attitudes of flight, and increase the ability to
   fly an aircraft throughout a wide performance range. The concepts learned from aerobatic
   practice are applicable in formation maneuvering and other advanced missions.
   6.16.2. Training emphasis is on smoothness and proper nose track during the maneuver.
   Strive to use the briefed entry parameters, but power and airspeed adjustments may be made
   to enhance energy planning or expedite the profile flow. Normally, the left hand is on the
   PCL, and the right hand is on the control stick. Avoid using a two-handed control stick
   technique to maintain a wings-level attitude. Indicated torque varies relative to altitude and
   airspeed without changing the PCL position. See Table 6.1 for a summary of entry airspeeds
   and power settings for aerobatics.

6.17. Aileron Roll (Figure 6.4.):
      6.17.1. Objective. Complete a 360-degree roll with a constant roll rate.
      6.17.2. Description. The aileron roll is a 360-degree roll about the longitudinal axis of the
      aircraft. The maneuver is complete when the wings are again parallel to the horizon.
          6.17.2.1. Airspeed. 180 to 220 KIAS.
          6.17.2.2. Power. 80 percent to MAX power.
          6.17.2.3. Attitude. Wings-level entry, 20 to 30 degrees nose-high pitch attitude.
          6.17.2.4. FCP Visual Reference. Corner of front windscreen on the horizon to start roll.
      6.17.3. Procedure. Attain briefed entry parameters. Smoothly raise the nose to 20 to 30
      degrees nose-high pitch attitude. Relax back stick pressure and stop nose track, then roll the
      aircraft left or right using coordinated aileron and rudder. The nose of the aircraft does not
      roll around a specific point in the roll. As the aircraft approaches wings level, neutralize the
      rudder and aileron, and return to level flight. In the T-6, an aileron roll to the left requires less
      rudder and aileron deflection than a roll to the right due to engine torque.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   111


   6.17.4. Technique. Visual references help keep focus outside. At 20 degrees NH, the clock
   is approximately on the horizon. At 30 degrees NH, the standby (STBY) airspeed indicator is
   on the horizon.

Figure 6.4. Aileron Roll.




6.18. Lazy Eight (Figure 6.5.):
   6.18.1. Objective. Maintain coordinated flight through two successive, symmetric, opposite
   direction turns that define the maneuver.
   6.18.2. Description. This is a slow, lazy maneuver that describes a horizontal figure eight at
   the horizon. The horizon line bisects this figure eight lengthwise. Pitch, bank, and airspeed
   constantly change. The maneuver is complete after two 180-degree turns with the aircraft in
   level flight.
       6.18.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 220 KIAS.
       6.18.2.2. Power. 50 to 60 percent torque.
       6.18.2.3. Attitude. Entry: wings level, 90 degrees MAX bank, 45 degrees MAX nose-
       high pitch.
       6.18.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 2,000 feet above and 1,000 below entry altitude.
       6.18.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. Bottom foot on or slightly above horizon at top of
       leaf, feet splitting horizon as you come through horizon, top foot on horizon at bottom of
       leaf.
   6.18.3. Procedure. Control pressure constantly changes because of changing bank, pitch,
   and airspeed. To help fly symmetrical leaves, select a prominent point on the horizon (90
   degrees off aircraft heading, for example, off the shoulder) or a ground reference, such as a
   section line or road (perpendicular to aircraft). Selected points should be far enough from the
 112                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   aircraft (not beneath the wing) so you won‘t fly over it. Mentally project an imaginary line
   from the aircraft to the horizon. Look in the direction of flight turn and clear throughout the
   maneuver.

Figure 6.5. Lazy Eight.




       6.18.3.1. Begin in straight-and-level flight with briefed entry airspeed and power setting.
       Select the desired reference point on the horizon or ground, and align the aircraft so the
       reference point is directly off a wingtip. Blend aileron, rudder, and elevator pressures
       simultaneously to start a gradual climbing turn in the direction of the reference point. The
       initial bank should be very shallow to prevent excessive turn rate. As the nose is raised,
       the airspeed decreases, causing the rate of turn to increase. Time the turn and pull-up so
       the nose reaches the highest pitch attitude (approximately 45 degrees) when the aircraft
       has turned 45 degrees or halfway to the reference point. Use outside references and the
       attitude indicator to cross-check these pitch-and-bank attitudes. Bank continues to
       increase as the nose falls. The aircraft should be pointed at the reference point as a
       maximum bank of 80 to 90 degrees is reached and the nose reaches the horizon. The
       lowest airspeed occurs just as the nose reaches the horizon (approximately 100 knots
       below entry airspeed).
       6.18.3.2. Do not freeze the pitch or bank at the horizon. Passing the horizon, let the nose
       fall, and begin rolling out of bank. The second half of the leaf (nose below horizon)
       should be symmetric and approximately the same size as the first half (nose above the
       horizon). The bank should change at the same rate as during the nose-up portion of the
       leaf. When the aircraft has turned 135 degrees, the nose should be at its lowest attitude
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    113


       and the bank should be 45 degrees. Continue blending control stick and rudder pressure
       to simultaneously raise the nose and level the wings. Monitor the progress of the turn by
       checking the outside reference point (off opposite shoulder from maneuver start). The
       aircraft should be wings level at entry airspeed as the nose reaches the horizon, having
       completed 180 degrees of turn. Without pausing, begin the second leaf in the opposite
       direction of the first.
   6.18.4. Technique:
       6.18.4.1. Set up perpendicular to a long road or section line. Visualize the road as the
       straight line part of a dollar sign ($). The two turns of the maneuver complete the ―S‖
       portion of the dollar sign. If ground references are unavailable, the heading bug can be set
       to the initial heading and used to monitor the progress of the turns.
       6.18.4.2. During the nose-up part of turns, pull to put the bottom foot (foot on inside of
       turn) on top of the horizon and roll around it until approximately reaching a 60-degree
       bank.
       6.18.4.3. When bringing the nose back to the horizon from a nose-low attitude, the
       number of knots below wings level airspeed should be approximately equal to the
       number of degrees NL. Example: If the desired wings-level airspeed is 220 knots, the
       airspeed should be approximately 190 knots at 30 degrees NL, 200 knots at 20 degrees
       NL, etc.
6.19. Barrel Roll (Figure 6.6.):
   6.19.1. Objective. Maintain coordinated flight through a 360-degree roll that describes a
   circle around a point near the horizon.
 114                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 6.6. Barrel Roll.




   6.19.2. Description. A barrel roll is a coordinated roll in which the nose of the aircraft
   describes a circle around a point on or near the horizon. Definite seat pressure should be felt
   throughout the roll. Practice in both directions. The maneuver is complete when the aircraft is
   wings level, abeam the reference point on the original side, at approximately entry airspeed.
       6.19.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 220 KIAS.
       6.19.2.2. Power. 80 percent to MAX power.
       6.19.2.3. Attitude. Entry, wings level.
       6.19.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 2,000 feet above and 1,000 feet below entry altitude.
       6.19.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. Reference point at or near the corner of front
       windscreen.
   6.19.3. Procedure. Select a reference point, such as a cloud or landmark, on or slightly
   above the horizon. Set briefed power and attain briefed entry airspeed with the nose of the
   aircraft below the horizon. Begin a coordinated turn in the opposite direction of the desired
   roll, as necessary, to place the aircraft up to 45 degrees to the side of the reference point. Roll
   out of the initial turn so the wings are level as the aircraft passes through the horizon. The
   distance to the side of the reference point depends on the initial turn and speed of the rollout.
   The distance from the reference point defines the size of the barrel roll, and it should remain
   constant throughout the maneuver. From level flight, increase pitch and bank. As the bank
   reaches 90 degrees, the aircraft should be directly above the reference point.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   115


       6.19.3.1. Passing 90 degrees of bank, relax some back pressure and increase aileron
       deflection to continue the roll with reduced airspeed. Back pressure must be reduced
       compared to the first quarter of the roll because gravity is now in the same direction as
       the lift vector (downward) when inverted. Plan the roll so the wings become level just as
       the aircraft reaches the inverted level-flight attitude. The aircraft should be displaced
       from the reference point the same distance as at the beginning of the maneuver.
       6.19.3.2. Continue the roll and apply increased elevator pressure. As the bank again
       reaches the 90 degrees at the bottom of the maneuver, the nose track should continue to
       arc around the reference point. In this last quarter of roll, increase back stick pressure
       because gravity is now working against the lift vector. Maintain coordinated control
       pressure to continue the roll so the nose completes the circle around the reference point,
       ending up wings level at the horizon.
   6.19.4. Technique. Choosing a reference point above the horizon and within the canopy
   bow helps ensure reasonable displacement and barrel roll size.
6.20. Loop (Figure 6.7.):
   6.20.1. Objective. Complete a 360-degree turn in the vertical with constant nose track.
   6.20.2. Description. The loop is a 360-degree turn in the vertical plane with constant
   heading and nose track. Because it is executed in a single plane, the elevator is the principle
   control surface. Ailerons and rudder are used to maintain directional control and coordinated
   flight. The maneuver is complete when wings are level at the horizon on the same heading as
   at entry.
       6.20.2.1. Airspeed. 230-250 KIAS.
       6.20.2.2. Power. MAX.
       6.20.2.3. Attitude. Wings level to horizon throughout maneuver.
       6.20.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 3,000 feet above entry altitude.
       6.20.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. - Wingtips equidistant from horizon in pull-up.
 116                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 6.7. Loop.




   6.20.3. Procedure. Begin straight-and-level to 20 degrees NL, with briefed entry airspeed
   and power setting. Smoothly pull the nose up using 3 to 4 Gs. When the forward view of the
   horizon disappears in the pull-up, maintain wings level (straight pull) by keeping the
   wingtips equidistant from the horizon. Back stick pressure and G loading decrease to
   maintain a constant nose track as airspeed decreases; however, aft control stick displacement
   increases. Right rudder pressure is required to keep the aircraft coordinated as airspeed
   decreases. Insufficient rudder, as airspeed decreases, may allow the nose to deviate up to 30
   degrees off desired track. Airspeed should be approximately 100 to 120 KIAS wings level
   inverted (over the top). Pull straight through the vertical and increase G loading to maintain a
   constant nose track until a level flight attitude is reached. Maintain coordinated rudder as the
   airspeed increases in the dive.
   6.20.4. Technique. Align the aircraft with a road or section line to provide a visual
   reference for a straight pull. Keep aligned with selected reference throughout the loop. If a
   ground reference is not available, the heading bug may be used to ensure a straight pull.
   Accelerate to entry airspeed with canopy bow on the horizon. Anticipate entry by 20 KIAS
   (an attitude of 20 degrees NL requires a 20 KIAS lead point to hit the desired target airspeed
   by the time the nose is back to level flight). Imagine pulling to the ―zipper‖ to ensure a
   straight pull. As the horizon disappears, use the cross-check of ―wingtip, wingtip, ball‖ to
   keep the wings level and flight coordinated. Make sure the wingtips are equidistant from the
   horizon. Roll away from the wingtip that has the most ground above it to level the wings. As
   the airspeed slows near the top of the loop, due to propeller effects, the nose will tend to yaw
   to the left, which can be detected by cross-checking the ball on the turn and slip indicator.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     117


   Use the memory aid of ―step on the ball‖ to push on the rudder coinciding with the side the
   ball is deflected to. Near vertical, tilt the head back and try to locate the horizon as early as
   possible. If the wings are not level, improper rudder application is most likely the problem.
6.21. Immelmann (Figure 6.8.):
   6.21.1. Objective. Complete a vertical, climbing, 180-degree turn with constant nose track.
   6.21.2. Description. The Immelmann is a half loop followed by a half roll, all flown in the
   same vertical plane. The maneuver is complete after a momentary pause in level flight with
   wings level on an opposite heading from entry.
      6.21.2.1. Airspeed. 230 to 250 KIAS.
      6.21.2.2. Power. MAX.
      6.21.2.3. Attitude. Wings level to horizon before and after half roll at top.
      6.21.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 3,000 feet above entry altitude.
      6.21.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. Wingtips equidistant from horizon in pull-up.

Figure 6.8. Immelmann.




   6.21.3. Procedure. Begin in straight-and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power
   setting. Smoothly pull the nose up using 3 to 4 Gs. When the forward view of the horizon
   disappears in the pull-up, maintain wings level (straight pull) by keeping the wingtips
   equidistant from the horizon. Back stick pressure and G loading decrease to maintain a
   constant nose track as airspeed decreases; however, aft control stick displacement increases.
   Moderate right rudder pressure is required to keep the aircraft coordinated as airspeed
   decreases. Insufficient rudder, as airspeed decreases, may allow the nose to deviate up to 30
   degrees off desired track. As the aircraft reaches a point approximately 10 degrees above the
   horizon inverted (FCP canopy bow on the horizon), relax back stick pressure and apply
   aileron with coordinated rudder in either direction to initiate a roll to level flight. Airspeed
 118                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   should be approximately 100 to 120 KIAS. The maneuver is complete after a momentary
   pause in level flight following the rollout.
   6.21.4. Technique. Reference the technique for the first half of the loop.
6.22. Split-S (Figure 6.9.):
   6.22.1. Objective. Complete a max performance, 180-degree descending turn in the pure
   vertical.
   6.22.2. Description. The split-S combines the first half of an aileron roll with the last half
   of a loop. It demonstrates how much altitude is lost if recovery from inverted flight is
   attempted by pulling through the horizon. The aircraft climbs during entry and descends
   during recovery. The maneuver is complete when the aircraft returns to level flight.
       6.22.2.1. Airspeed. 120 to 140 KIAS.
       6.22.2.2. Power. Idle to 80 percent.
       6.22.2.3. Attitude. Entry: 20 degrees NH. Wings level before and throughout pull.
       6.22.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 2,500 feet below entry altitude.
       6.22.2.5. FCP Visual Reference. Corner of forward windscreen on horizon to start roll.

Figure 6.9. Split-S.




   6.22.3. Procedure. Begin in straight-and-level flight approximately 40 KIAS above briefed
   entry airspeed. Briefed power setting may be established any time before or during the half
   roll. Raise the nose to approximately a 20-degree pitch attitude (FCP clock on the horizon).
   When the airspeed is approximately 20 KIAS above briefed entry airspeed, roll the aircraft to
   the wings-level, inverted attitude. Apply back pressure to bring the nose through the horizon.
   To avoid excessive G and airspeed at the bottom, attempt to max perform once the nose
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      119


   passes the horizon. Airspeed and G loading (approximately 3 to 4 Gs) increase during the
   pullout. Perform a proper anti-G strain.
   6.22.4. Technique. Attempt to set up the maneuver over a road or section line. Ensure
   wings are level-inverted before starting pull. Imagine pulling to the ―zipper‖ to ensure a
   straight pull. Looking at successive points above the canopy bow (as described on the back
   half of the loop) that lead in a straight line from below the aircraft out to the horizon can also
   help ensure a straight pull.
6.23. Cuban Eight (Figure 6.10.):
   6.23.1. Objective. Maintain coordinated flight through two successive loop-type turns in
   the vertical.
   6.23.2. Description. Each half of this maneuver is a combination of a slightly modified loop
   and Immelmann. The first portion of each leaf is approximately the first five-eighths of a
   loop followed by a half roll. The pull and roll is then repeated in the opposite direction. The
   maneuver looks like an ―8‖ on its side. The maneuver is complete at level flight, with entry
   airspeed and on original heading.
      6.23.2.1. Airspeed. 230 to 250 KIAS.
      6.23.2.2. Power. MAX.
      6.23.2.3. Attitude. Wings level to horizon throughout maneuver.
      6.23.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 3,000 feet above entry altitude.
      6.23.2.5. FCP Visual Reference:
          6.23.2.5.1. Wingtips equidistant from horizon in pull-up.
          6.23.2.5.2. Seat on horizon when 45 degrees NL, inverted.

Figure 6.10. Cuban Eight.




   6.23.3. Procedure. Begin in straight-and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power
   setting. Perform the first part of a loop until over the top, inverted. After passing through
   inverted-level flight, continue the loop until approaching 45 degrees NL, inverted. Execute a
   coordinated half roll in either direction. Relax the elevator pressure to keep the nose track in
   the same vertical plane. After completing the half roll, maintain 45 degrees NL until
   beginning the pull-up for the second half of the maneuver. Plan to initiate the pull-up to
   attain briefed entry airspeed at the horizon (passing through level flight). To accomplish this,
   begin the pull-up approximately 35 to 40 KIAS below briefed entry airspeed (the airspeed
   lead point is approximately equal to number of degrees of NL pitch). Continue the pull-up
   into another loop entry. The second half of the Cuban Eight is identical to the first except the
   roll is in the opposite direction.
   6.23.4. Technique. Use ground references, or the heading bug, as in other over-the-top
   maneuvers. Upon reaching 45 degrees NL, inverted flight (seat on the horizon), momentarily
   freeze the control stick before the coordinated roll. To maintain 45 degrees NL, pick a point
   on the ground and freeze it in the windscreen. Verbalizing the roll direction on the first half
   of the maneuver will help ensure the roll on the second half of the maneuver is in the correct
   direction.
6.24. Cloverleaf (Figure 6.11.):
   6.24.1. Objective. Combine elements of the loop, roll, and split-S into a fluid maneuver.
   6.24.2. Description. The cloverleaf is composed of four identical maneuvers, each of which
   changes heading by 90 degrees. The pull-up is similar to the loop, although with less G
   loading. The top part is a rolling pull to the horizon 90 degrees displaced from the original
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      121


   heading. The pulling roll resembles an NH recovery. The lower part or pull-through is flown
   like a split-S. The maneuver is complete in level flight after four leaves in the same direction.
   Fewer than four leaves may be performed when practicing the maneuver.
       6.24.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 220 KIAS.
       6.24.2.2. Power. 80 percent to MAX.
       6.24.2.3. Attitude. Wings level for pull-up and pull-through.
       6.24.2.4. Altitude. Approximately 3,000 feet above and 1,000 feet below entry altitude.

   6.24.3. Procedure. Begin in straight-and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power
   setting. Pick a reference point 90 degrees off the nose in the desired direction. The initial part
   of the maneuver is a straight pull-up, similar to a loop, except for a slightly lower G loading
   (2 to 3 Gs). As the aircraft reaches 45 degrees NH (feet on the horizon), begin a coordinated
   roll toward the 90-degree reference point. Allow the nose to continue climbing during the roll
   so the maneuver is fairly slow and lazy. Coordinate the pull and roll so the nose passes
   through the reference point with the aircraft wings level, inverted, and at a relatively low
   airspeed (approximately 120 KIAS). Do not stare at the airspeed indicator, but note the
   airspeed at the inverted point. Consider discontinuing the maneuver if airspeed is above
   approximately 150 to 160 KIAS. Keep the wings level and pull through the bottom of the
 122                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   maneuver as in the split-S. To avoid excessive G and airspeed at the bottom, attempt to max
   perform (as in the split-S) once the nose passes the horizon. Approaching the horizon in the
   pull-through, reduce back pressure to allow acceleration to entry airspeed at the horizon.
   Complete three additional leaves in the same direction.
   6.24.4. Technique. Use section lines or prominent roads off of the wingtip in the direction
   of turn to visually identify 90-degree points. Begin roll when feet are on the horizon. A
   combination of roll and pull is necessary to be inverted, wings level over the reference point.
   Cross-check G load at the horizon after each pull through the bottom. Reaching 200 to 220
   knots at the horizon, G may then have to be reduced to the 2 to 3 Gs required for the initial
   pull-up by releasing back stick pressure.

   6.25.2. Description. The Chandelle is a precision, constant bank 180-degree steep climbing
   turn that achieves a maximum gain of altitude for a given power setting. The maneuver is
   complete after 180 degrees of turn.
       6.25.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 250 KIAS.
       6.25.2.2. Power. MAX.
       6.25.2.3. Attitude. Entry, wings level, 15 degrees NL; exit, wings level, 45 degrees
       NH.

         6.25.2.5.1. Bottom edge of canopy on horizon at entry.
         6.25.2.5.2. Feet on horizon (45 degrees NH) at exit.
  6.25.3. Procedure:
     6.25.3.1. Begin wings level, 15 degrees NL with briefed power setting but below briefed
     entry airspeed. When airspeed reaches briefed entry airspeed, blend rudder, aileron, and
     elevator pressure simultaneously to begin a climbing turn, using approximately 3 Gs.
     Increase bank to 60 degrees and keep the nose track rising at a uniform rate. The nose
     should describe a straight line diagonal to the horizon. The nose should pass through the
     horizon at 60 degrees bank with 30 to 45 degrees of turn complete. Check the amount of
     turn by using outside references. Once the nose is above the horizon, the vertical
     component of lift decreases, and considerably more back pressure is required to keep the
     nose rising at a uniform rate. These variables in the pitch angle, airspeed, and the vertical
     component of lift require constant changes in control pressures to keep the nose rising at
     a constant rate. At the 135-degree point in the turn, start the rollout but keep the nose
     rising. Monitor the amount of turn remaining before reaching the 180-degree point by
     checking outside references. Time the rollout so the wings become level as the nose
     reaches the highest pitch attitude (approximately 40 to 45 degrees) at the 180-degree
     point. When the maneuver is complete (180 degrees of turn), lower the nose to the
     horizon or perform a nose-high recovery.
     6.25.3.2. If the rate of climb is too fast, and the aircraft approaches stall before turning
     180 degrees discontinue the maneuver by performing a nose-high recovery. If the rate of
     pitch change is too slow, the 180-degree point may be reached before the maximum pitch
     attitude is attained. When starting the maneuver, the rate of roll-in is faster than the rate
     of pull-up (60 degrees bank change, 15 degrees pitch change).
  6.25.4. Technique. Use perpendicular and parallel roads or section lines to visually monitor
  progress of turns. Inside the cockpit, the heading marker can be a good cross-check tool in
  addition to cross-checking bank and pitch on the main attitude indicator (ADI). Outside the
  cockpit, pick a reference point and place it 90 degrees off either shoulder. Begin a turn away
  from the reference point. Once the reference point becomes visible again off the other
  shoulder, you will have completed approximately 135 degrees of turn, prompting the rollout
  to achieve 180 degrees of turn. Visualizing the Chandelle as similar to climbing a spiral
  staircase can help with maneuver execution.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   INSTRUMENT FLYING

7.1. Introduction. Instrument flight in Air Force aircraft is governed by standardized rules and
procedures. Most of the standardized guidance is found in sources other than this manual.
AFMAN 11-217, Volumes 1 and 3 are the main sources of guidance for instrument flight. They
contain detailed information on most of the topics presented in this chapter and must be studied
to ensure success. This chapter provides T-6-specific considerations for instrument flight and
presents information on training rules, basic and advanced instrument maneuvers, spatial
disorientation, and the application of basic principles to instrument mission execution. You
should also refer to FLIPs, such as the Flight Information Handbook, IFR Supplement, and
General Planning; AFI 11-202, Volume 3; Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)/AIM; and the
flight manual for additional instrument flight guidance.
7.2. RCP Instrument Procedures. For instrument flight, the RCP is functionally the same as
the FCP. When a JPPT student pilot occupies the RCP, the instructor performs all landings.
7.3. Use of Vision-Restricting Device (VRD). To enhance instrument training, a VRD is used
during student instrument training sorties. The VRD (commonly called the hood) is used to
restrict peripheral vision and force dependence on instruments for SA. When under the hood,
focus on the instrument cross-check as if in actual instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).
Use the VRD according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3; AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3; and the appropriate
syllabus. The VRD will not be worn by pilots in the FCP.
7.4. EFIS and GPS Display Options. There are multiple configurations for the EFIS and GPS.
Normally, a standard display setup (established locally) is used until proficiency is demonstrated.
After demonstrating proficiency, other than standard display options may be used to optimize SA
and precise control of the aircraft.
7.5. Task Management. Unlike contact flying, the horizon is not used to determine pitch and
bank. Instrument flight uses the EADI for attitude information. As visual cues become less
prominent, a greater percentage of attention must be focused on the EADI. Time-consuming
tasks such as approach plate review, chart manipulation, and NAVAID setup or GPS
programming should be accomplished as the workload allows with control of the aircraft attitude
always maintained as first priority. Complex tasks that divert attention from basic instrument
flight should be broken down into subtasks; complete a subtask then return full attention to the
instruments. Alternate attention between subtasks and the instruments until the full task is
complete. Effectively trimming the aircraft significantly reduces workload in controlling the
aircraft and is the key to successfully accomplishing other subtasks. Anticipate and begin
required actions as early as practical such as putting anticipated frequencies and NAVAIDs into
the queue or STBY function of the RMU.
7.6. Cockpit Organization. An organized approach to cockpit setup is essential due to the
additional publications, such as charts and approach plates, required on most instrument sorties.
Consideration for cockpit organization during mission planning can pay big dividends when it
gets busy in the aircraft. In general, strive to find ways to get ahead and prepare for upcoming
tasks. The following examples are just a few of the techniques that can help improve task
management and cockpit organization:
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      125


      7.6.1. Pre-fold all charts before strap-in. Store them in the order they will be used.
      7.6.2. Use AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, VFR chart (when flying a VFR
      leg), or lineup card to annotate information that is likely to be required in flight.
      7.6.3. Fold flight plan or other paperwork so it is easy to read. Store in order of use.
      7.6.4. Use a self-adhesive tab or rubber band to mark required pages in the IFR supplement
      and IAP.
      7.6.5. Write down radio frequencies as they are assigned.
      7.6.6. Print and highlight applicable NOTAMs.
      7.6.7. Use the STBY frequency function of the RMU to anticipate radio changes.
7.7. Control and Performance Concept. Proper use of the control and performance concept
(described in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1) makes basic aircraft control much easier and frees
attention for other tasks. T-6 control instruments are the EADI and the primary engine data
display (specifically, engine torque). Performance instruments are the altimeter, airspeed
indicator, VSI, AOA, and EHSI (heading). When possible, start with the known pitch and power
settings (See Table 7.1). These power settings vary slightly between aircraft depending on fuel
load and temperature. Use of known pitch and power settings helps to minimize power changes.
Excessive or continual power changes in the T-6 cause heading, pitch, and trim deviations,
which make precise instrument flight more difficult.

 NOTES:
 1. All torque settings are approximate and vary slightly depending on density altitude and aircraft
 weight.
 2. An 800 to 1,000–foot per NM penetration descent (8 to 10 degrees NL) ensures you remain within
 protected airspace on a penetration approach. See AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1.

7.8. Instrument Flight Maneuvers. Instrument flight is simply a series of basic instrument
maneuvers flown in a sequence that depends on the route, WX, air traffic congestion, and other
factors. The following basic maneuvers are the building blocks for advanced concepts described
later in this chapter.
7.9. Turns and Turns To Headings:
   7.9.1. Objective. Maintain smooth, coordinated flight in turns to specific headings.
   7.9.2. Description. Normally, bank is no greater than 30 degrees to reduce the chances of
   spatial disorientation.
   7.9.3. Procedure. Apply coordinated aileron and rudder in the direction of the turn. Refer to
   the EADI for bank information. In level turns, maintain constant altitude and airspeed by
   cross-checking the EADI and performance instruments. Increase the pitch attitude, as
   necessary, to counteract the loss of lift when the aircraft is banked. Apply corrections when
   the flight instruments indicate a deviation. When the desired bank is reached, it may be
   necessary to exert slight aileron pressure in the opposite direction to prevent over-banking.
   Maintain the desired AOB. Adjust power to hold a constant airspeed. As the bank is
   established, a small increase in power is usually required. Reverse these procedures to return
   to straight-and-level flight.
7.10. Airspeed Changes:
   7.10.1. Objective. Smooth, controlled, deliberate change of airspeed.
   7.10.2. Description. Change of power setting to affect change in airspeed. At completion of
   airspeed change, power is set to maintain new airspeed. Aircraft trimmed during airspeed
   change and fine tuned at target airspeed. Normally practiced between 110 and 250 KIAS.
   7.10.3. Procedure. To increase airspeed in straight-and-level flight, advance the power
   beyond the setting required to maintain the new airspeed. As airspeed increases, lift increases
   so there is a climb tendency. Adjust pitch attitude to maintain altitude. Approaching target
   airspeed, reduce power to a setting estimated to maintain the new airspeed. Reduce airspeed
   in the same manner but use an opposite power schedule.
   7.10.4. Adjustments to trim will be required almost continually during airspeed changes. Do
   not neglect the need for rudder trim. An increase in torque generally requires nose-right
   rudder trim. Likewise, a reduction in torque requires nose-left rudder trim. Speed brake may
   be used for rapid airspeed reductions; however, use caution as the susceptibility for spatial
   disorientation increases with use of the speed brake in IMC.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   127


7.11. Constant Airspeed Climbs and Descents:
   7.11.1. Objective. Maintain constant airspeed during climb or descent.
   7.11.2. Description. Climb or descend at a specific airspeed. Normally practiced at 110 to
   250 KIAS.
   7.11.3. Procedure. To climb, simultaneously increase power and raise pitch to maintain
   desired airspeed. To descend, simultaneously reduce power and lower pitch to maintain
   desired airspeed. The amount of pitch change varies with airspeed and power setting.
   Although airspeed is constant, trim is required due to power change.
7.12. Constant Rate Climbs and Descents:
   7.12.1. Objective. Maintain constant vertical speed during climb or descent.
   7.12.2. Description. Climb or descend at constant rate, normally at constant airspeed.
   Usually practiced between 110 and 250 KIAS, and 500 to 4,000 fpm.
   7.12.3. Procedure. Simultaneously advance or reduce power and change pitch to affect
   desired climb or descent rate. When vertical speed stabilizes, adjust pitch and power to
   maintain target vertical speed and airspeed.
   7.12.4. Application. Initially use known pitch and power setting, then fine tune when
   vertical speed stabilizes. The 60-to-1 rule can be used to calculate pitch change required for
   target vertical speed: 1 degree of pitch change equals 100 feet per NM. Example: At 240
   knots true airspeed (KTAS) (or 4 NM per minute), 2 degrees of pitch change is 4 NM per
   minute multiplied by 200 feet per NM, resulting in 800 fpm vertical speed. If airspeed and
   target vertical speed are fixed, the formula to solve for required pitch change is: VSI divided
   by NM per minute, divided by 100 equals pitch change. Example: Target vertical speed
   1,000 fpm at 150 KTAS (2.5 NM per minute) equals 4-degree pitch change).
7.13. Instrument Slow Flight:
   7.13.1. Objective. Familiarization with handling characteristics in approach configuration
   at approach airspeeds.
   7.13.2. Description:
      7.13.2.1. Airspeed. 110 to 120 KIAS.
      7.13.2.2. Gear. Down.
      7.13.2.3. Flaps. TO.
      7.13.2.4. Attitude. 3 degrees NH; 0 to 30 degrees AOB.
   7.13.3. Procedure. Slow and configure as for an instrument approach. Practice level flight,
   turns, and descents.
   7.13.4. Techniques. Use known pitch and power settings. Use 60-to-1 to determine pitch
   change for target descent rate on simulated approaches. Practice level, shallow bank turns at
   110 KIAS to simulate corrections on final. Practice level-off at simulated minimum descent
   altitude (MDA). Practice 30-degree bank turns at 120 KIAS to simulate maneuvering on a
   circling approach.

7.14. Steep Turns:
   7.14.1. Objective. Maintain smooth, coordinated flight in turns to specific headings at
   steeper than normal bank angles.
   7.14.2. Description:
       7.14.2.1. Airspeed. 150 KIAS normally, other airspeeds permissible.
       7.14.2.2. Attitude. 45-degree and 60-degree bank.
   7.14.3. Procedure. Enter a steep turn in the same manner as a normal turn. Anticipate the
   addition of power to maintain a constant airspeed. Pitch required in the turn is higher than
   wings level flight. Anticipate pitch change as VSI lags behind actual aircraft performance.
   Use a constant AOB during steep turns, and attempt to correct altitude deviations by
   adjusting the pitch attitude; however, if altitude gain or loss is excessive, a decrease or
   increase in bank can help correct the pitch attitude.
   7.14.4. Technique. ―Bug, turn, talk.‖ Use the known pitch and power settings in Table 7.1.
   Add power passing 30 degrees of bank. To roll out on the desired heading, as a starting point,
   lead the rollout by approximately 15 degrees for a 45-degree bank turn and 20 degrees for a
   60-degree bank turn. Lead points should be adjusted as necessary if consistently rolling out
   short or past the desired heading.
7.15. Vertical-S:
   7.15.1. Objective. Practice instrument cross-check.
   7.15.2. Description. As described in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Climb or descent at 1,000
   fpm and 150 KIAS. Type flown (A-B-C-D) based on proficiency. See Table 7.1 for target
   pitch and power settings.
   7.15.3. Procedure. Use procedures for constant rate climbs and descents.
   7.15.4. Technique. Begin with aircraft completely trimmed (trimmed hands-off, see
   paragraph 2.9.1.5) for level flight at 150 KIAS. Lead the change at the top or bottom of the
   maneuver by 100 feet (10 percent of VSI). Lead pitch reversal with power. Generally, control
   VSI with pitch; control airspeed with power.
7.16. Confidence Maneuvers:
   7.16.1. Objective. Gain confidence in the use of the attitude indicator in extreme pitch and
   bank attitudes.
   7.16.2. Description. Wingover (similar to one-half Lazy Eight) and aileron roll flown with
   EADI as the primary reference. Each maneuver is complete when stabilized in level flight.
       7.16.2.1. Airspeed. 220 KIAS.
       7.16.2.2. Power. 80 percent to MAX .
   7.16.3. Procedure. Begin in straight-and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power
   setting.
       7.16.3.1. Aileron Roll. Begin in straight-and-level flight, at entry airspeed and power
       setting. Maintain wings level and raise the nose 15 to 25 degrees on the EADI. Use
       aileron and rudder to perform a coordinated roll. Start with a moderate roll rate. Unlike
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      129


      the contact aileron roll, a constant roll rate is not the goal. Adjust the roll rate to pass
      through the horizon in a wings-level, inverted attitude. Do not unload, when inverted, to
      hit the horizon. Continue rolling to wings-level upright, as the nose continues to drop to
      approximately 15 to 25 degrees NL at about 220 KIAS. Smoothly return to level flight.
      7.16.3.2. Wingover. Begin in straight-and-level flight, at entry airspeed and power
      setting. The wingover is a slow and precise maneuver with a constant roll rate. Increase
      back pressure and start to roll such that the low wingtip of the EADI fixed aircraft symbol
      remains on the horizon bar. Back pressure increases as bank increases to 60 degrees.
      Pitch is approximately 10 degrees NH at 30 degrees bank. At 60 degrees bank, pitch is
      approximately 20 degrees NH. As the nose falls, continue to roll. At the horizon, bank
      should be 90 degrees. Begin to roll out passing the horizon. Increase back pressure and
      approaching 60 degrees-bank, catch the high wingtip on the horizon bar. Pitch is about 20
      degrees NL. Keep the wingtip on the horizon bar until wings level.
7.17. Unusual Attitude Recoveries:
   7.17.1. Objective. Recover to normal attitude with reference to instruments only.
   7.17.2. Description. An unusual attitude is any unexpected or inadvertent attitude
   encountered during normal instrument flight. Generally, in IMC conditions, bank should be
   limited to 30 degrees, and pitch limited to 10 degrees NL to 15 degrees NH. Possible causes
   of unusual attitudes include slow cross-check, spatial disorientation, channelization on a
   subtask, and transition from VFR to IFR. The recovery is complete when desired attitude, for
   normal instrument flight, is reached.
   7.17.3. Procedure. Perform recoveries as described in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Use the
   EADI as the main recovery instrument after proper operation is verified and it is confirmed
   that an unusual attitude exists. Compare the EADI indication with the STBY attitude
   indicator and performance instruments to confirm an unusual attitude.
      7.17.3.1. If operating properly, the EADI is used to recover. The horizon bar is always
      visible, but in extreme nose-high or nose-low attitudes it may be very near the bottom or
      top of the EADI. In these cases, red recovery chevrons point to the horizon and may be
      used to determine attitude.
      7.17.3.2. Bank interpretation and control response are most important in recovering from
      unusual attitudes. In high performance aircraft, an inverted (beyond 90 degrees of bank),
      diving attitude is the most critical situation. Correction to an upright attitude (less than 90
      degrees bank) is the priority and must be initiated before pitch correction.
      7.17.3.3. If the aircraft is diving, roll toward wings level and start pull-up when bank is
      less than 90 degrees. Reduce power and extend the speed brake if required.
      7.17.3.4. If the aircraft is climbing, use power as required to maintain desired airspeed.
      As the fuselage dot of the miniature aircraft approaches the horizon bar, adjust bank to
      establish a wings-level attitude. If airspeed is low, the nose may continue below the
      horizon. Only use as much bank as required to recover; it is not necessary to use 90
      degrees in all recoveries.
   7.17.4. Technique. ―Recognize, confirm, recover:‖
 130                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       7.17.4.1. Recognize. Identify potential unusual attitude with EADI and aircraft
       performance.
       7.17.4.2. Confirm. Verify actual attitude with STBY ADI and performance instruments.
       7.17.4.3. Recover. Apply appropriate recovery procedure.
7.18. Spatial Disorientation Demonstrations. The maneuvers in paragraphs 7.18.1, 7.18.2,
and 7.18.3 simulate three common types of spatial disorientation illusions. They reaffirm the
requirement to rely on instruments during instrument flight instead of seat-of-the-pants
sensations. An IP is required to practice these maneuvers and they will only be conducted in
VFR conditions. The purpose of these demonstrations is to help a student pilot understand the
real threat of spatial disorientation and the importance of trusting flight instruments. See
AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for further information.
   7.18.1. Leans:
       7.18.1.1. Definition. An illusion experienced due to the effects of aircraft motion about
       the longitudinal axis (roll) on the semi-circular canals. There are three phases – roll entry,
       roll sustainment and roll-out. Each elicits a sensation that may be correct or false with
       regards to aircraft motion. This is commonly experienced while maneuvering, being
       vectored in the WX, or at night, and can be particularly problematic during sustained or
       slow rate turns.
       7.18.1.2. Demonstration. The PNF closes eyes while the aircraft is in a straight-and-
       level attitude. PF executes a well-coordinated instrument turn, which the PNF should
       sense correctly with eyes closed. As the PF sustains the constant rate turn for 8 to 10
       seconds, the PNF should experience a ‗straight-and-level‘ sensation. At roll-out to
       straight-and-level flight, the PNF should experience the illusion of roll in the opposite
       direction of the original bank. In the absence of a good instrument crosscheck, this may
       lead to re-entry into the original roll at often more severe bank angles in an attempt to
       ―feel‖ straight and level during instrument flight conditions.
   7.18.2. Coriolis Effect:
       7.18.2.1. Definition. An illusion experienced when more than one angular plane of
       motion (POM) is stimulated in the inner ear. This is usually accomplished through the
       simultaneous motion of the head and aircraft but in different planes, such as when
       looking down at an approach plate or checklist during a turn in instrument flight
       conditions. The result can be a sense of motion in the form of tumbling or vertigo and
       loss of orientation awareness. Compensatory eye movements in the form of nystagmus
       may occur and make aircraft instrument recovery much more difficult.
       7.18.2.2. Demonstration. The PF executes a well-coordinated instrument turn while the
       PNF closes their eyes and rotates their head position from facing forward to facing
       downward towards their lap, then back to facing forward while the aircraft is banking or
       rolling out of bank. The PNF will experience the Coriolis illusion and have difficulty in
       distinguishing orientation even after the PNF re-opens their eyes and focuses on their
       instruments. This demonstrates the danger of not only excessive head movement during
       aircraft motion in instrument flight conditions but also difficulty in determining correct
       instrument recovery procedures due to the severity of the illusion.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    131


   7.18.3. Pitch and Elevator Illusions:
       7.18.3.1. Definition. A false sensation of pitch created by the effects of acceleration on
       the otolith organs. During instrument flight conditions positive acceleration can lead to a
       sense of nose-up pitch while deceleration can result in a sensation of nose-down pitch.
       Normally associated with take-off at night or in the WX, the combination of positive
       acceleration and pitch required for takeoff rotation can lead to a sense of over pitch and
       cause aggressive pitch-down control inputs to compensate. Go-arounds and missed
       approaches at night or in instrument conditions are also common scenarios where this
       illusion can result in inappropriate aircraft control inputs. Sudden climbs and dives or
       abrupt changes to climbs and dives such as sudden level-offs can lead to a sensation of
       excessive vertical motion or the continuation of a climb or dive, as if in an elevator, even
       after vertical motion has stopped.
       7.18.3.2. Demonstration. PF configures the aircraft normally for an instrument
       approach while the PNF closes their eyes. Once established at final approach speed, the
       PF executes a simulated missed approach using normal procedures, allowing the aircraft
       to accelerate to a normal climb speed. PNF should sense a pitch in excess of actual
       aircraft performance. After climbing approximately 1,000 feet, PF levels the aircraft at
       moderate rate (faster than what would be normally desired). The PNF should experience
       the sensation of continuing to climb (elevator illusion). The demonstration warns pilots of
       the tendency to compensate with a pitch-down response in degraded visual conditions.
7.19. Application of Instrument Flight Maneuvers. The basic maneuvers and principles of
instrument flight are the basis for safe instrument flight. Skills developed in practice are used
alone, or in combination, to perform an instrument sortie from takeoff through the enroute
portion to descent and landing.
7.20. Instrument Takeoff (ITO) and Climb:
   7.20.1. Objective. Safely transition to IMC from a normal takeoff (VMC).
   7.20.2. Description. Normal takeoff based on visual cues with transition to instruments on
   departure leg at the same rate as the loss of visual cues.
   7.20.3. Procedure. Perform a normal takeoff. After lift-off, use outside references and the
   EADI to control attitude. Transition to instruments at the same rate as visual cues are lost.
   Unless otherwise directed, do not turn until at a minimum of 140 KIAS and 400 feet AGL.
   Initially raise the nose to 7 to 10 degrees NH indication on the EADI to establish a definite
   rate of climb. Trim and verify climb with altimeter and VSI. Maintain initial attitude until
   target climb speed. Nonstandard climb gradients, on published departures, may require
   adjustments to the climb profile. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for additional information.
   7.20.4. Technique. Consider a static takeoff to allow for a thorough check of all systems
   prior to brake release and takeoff into IMC. Before takeoff, review impact of IMC on
   emergency recovery options.
7.21. Level-off:
   7.21.1. Objective. Smoothly level-off at desired altitude with power set to attain or
   maintain desired airspeed.
 132                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   7.21.2. Description. Change of pitch to reduce vertical speed at a specific altitude
   combined with power adjustment to meet desired airspeed.
   7.21.3. Procedure. To level-off at airspeed below climb speed, lower the nose to level
   flight and reduce power below the setting required to maintain the lower airspeed. To level-
   off at a higher airspeed, leave the PCL at MAX or set power above the setting required to
   maintain the greater airspeed. Adjust power approaching target airspeed, and apply trim. Use
   similar procedures for a level-off from a descent.
   7.21.4. Technique. Use 10 percent of vertical speed (from VSI) as a lead point to begin
   level-off. For example, begin level-off 200 feet below desired altitude when VSI indicates
   2,000 fpm. At the lead point, cut the pitch in half, and then continue pitch change to
   smoothly level-off. If intermediate level-offs are required, it is permissible to maintain climb
   airspeed or accelerate to the appropriate cruise speed for that altitude.
7.22. Instrument Departures:
   7.22.1. Objective. Comply with departure procedures and safely transition from takeoff to
   the enroute structure.
   7.22.2. Description. Departure routes and altitudes are designed to provide clearance from
   obstacles or efficient traffic flow. Consult AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed
   information on instrument departures.
   7.22.3. Procedure. Consult AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed procedures for
   instrument departure. Minimum obstacle and ATC climb gradients must be met.
   7.22.4. Technique:
       7.22.4.1. Review the entire departure procedure to include surrounding terrain, hazards,
       and climb gradient requirements during preflight planning. The departure review during
       the ―R-NEWS‖ check is not a substitute for thorough preflight review.
       7.22.4.2. Set NAVAIDs and displays, as required, to fly the departure.
       7.22.4.3. Thoroughly review the airfield diagram (strange field).
       7.22.4.4. Develop a plan for emergency return. Have an instrument approach plate open
       with the primary recovery approach displayed in case immediate return to the departure
       base is required. A common technique is to develop specific course of action for each
       section of the departure. For example, review potential actions for problems before gear
       retraction, after gear retraction but VMC, and in IMC. Review surrounding terrain for
       effects on emergency recovery.
       7.22.4.5. Review NORDO procedures.
7.23. Course Intercepts: See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for course intercept procedures with
an HSI. See Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 for examples with T-6 instrumentation.
   7.23.1. Objective. Intercept a radial inbound or outbound from a station.
   7.23.2. Description. Turns to intercept specific courses to comply with published or
   assigned departure, in route, or arrival routing.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                 133


  7.23.3. Procedures. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for course intercept procedures with
  an HSI. See Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 for examples with T-6 instrumentation.
  7.23.4. Technique:
     7.23.4.1. Set the heading bug on the intercept heading. Lead points are dependent on the
     CDI rate of movement and turn radius.
     7.23.4.2. To intercept a course inbound, ―Charlie Brown plus 30, not to exceed 90‖ is a
     common memory aid. Start at the course arrow (Charlie) on the EHSI, move up the case
     to the bearing pointer (Brown), and finally continue 30 degrees past the bearing pointer to
     identify the intercept heading.
     7.23.4.3. To intercept a course outbound, ―Top Cat plus 45, not to exceed the head of the
     bearing pointer‖ is a common memory aid. Start on the tail of the bearing pointer (Top),
     move up the case to the course arrow (Cat), and finally continue 45 degrees past the
     course arrow, but not to exceed the head of the bearing pointer, to identify the intercept
     heading. Bird‘s-eye-view awareness of aircraft location in relation to the NAVAID
     (radial/DME) as well as the desired radial to be intercepted will serve as a sanity check
     that the chosen intercept heading makes sense.
     7.23.4.4. To maintain a course and correct for winds, divide the crosswind component of
     the wind by the true airspeed in NM per minute. For example, if flying at 240 KTAS/4
     NM per minute, with 40 knots of crosswind, approximately 10 degrees of drift correction
     (40 knots/4 NM per minute) into the wind are required to maintain a course.

7.24. Arc and Radial Intercepts. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed information on
arc and radial intercepts. At normal T-6 airspeeds, lead points are not large, and the rate of CDI
movement during the intercept can be used to determine the lead point.
7.25. Fix-to-Fix. Proceed directly to a point defined by radial/DME and/or RNAV waypoint
using onboard navigational equipment. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1 for procedures.
   7.25.1. Objective. Proceed directly to a point defined by radial and DME, using onboard
   navigational equipment.
   7.25.2. Description. Specific points on the EHSI represent location and target radial or
   DME. The relative positions of current and desired position enable determination of the
   course between them.
   7.25.3. Procedure. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   7.25.4. Technique:
       7.25.4.1. Tune, identify, monitor (TIM) NAVAID and confirm the correct frequency is
       selected. Set radial of the desired fix in the CSW.
       7.25.4.2. Turn in the shorter direction to a heading between the head of the bearing
       pointer and the head of the course arrow (which is the desired radial). Favor the head of
       the bearing pointer (which brings you closer to the selected station) if destination DME is
       less than current DME. Favor the head of the course arrow if destination DME is greater
       than current DME. Note: A heading (in a no-wind condition) exactly between the head of
       the bearing pointer and the head of the course arrow results in arrival at the target radial
       at the same DME as current DME. If both the bearing pointer and the head of the course
       arrow are in the upper half of the EHSI, the DME will initially get smaller than the
       current position DME before increasing to the target DME (referred to as cutting the arc).
       7.25.4.3. After turning to an initial heading, fine tune and update the fix-to-fix by
       envisioning the aircraft‘s current position and the targeted fix superimposed on the EHSI
       as if it were a map. Use the DME of the position (current aircraft location or desired fix)
       furthest from the station as the distance to the outer ring of the EHSI bezel. The ground
       station is then located at the center of the EHSI. The current aircraft position is always
       somewhere on the tail of the bearing pointer, and the targeted fix is always somewhere
       between the center and the head of the course arrow. The relationship between the two
       points allows determination of turn direction and an estimate of the initial heading. Figure
       7.3 and Figure 7.4 compute a fix-to-fix heading from the current aircraft position (180
       radial at 60 DME, heading 360 degrees) to the targeted fix (090 radial at 30 DME).
       Current position is 60 NM south of the station, heading north. The target fix is 30 NM
       east of the station. The resultant heading to the fix under no wind conditions is
       approximately 025 degrees.
       7.25.4.4. The following simple facts can prevent confusion. Current aircraft position is
       always somewhere between the tail of the bearing pointer and the center of the EHSI. The
       target fix is always somewhere between the center of the EHSI and the course arrow. The
       distance from the center to the outer edge of the compass card is always equal to the
       larger DME; therefore, either the current position or target fix is located on the outer edge
       of the compass card.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   137


      7.25.4.5. The pencil method may be used to determine heading from current position and
      target fix. A pencil can be used (or just visualize straight line) to connect the two
      positions with an imaginary line (Figure 7.3, photo C). Then imagine a parallel line
      through the center of the compass card. This line through the center of the compass card
      intercepts the no-wind heading to the target fix (Figure 7.3, photo D). A pencil is not
      necessary but may help develop the ability to imagine the proper lines.
      7.25.4.6. The plumb bob can supplement the pencil method to determine heading to the
      target fix. As in the pencil method, imagine a line between current position and target fix.
      Turn to put the line in a vertical orientation (fixes aligned vertically).
      7.25.4.7. Apply known wind drift corrections. A requirement for significant heading
      changes during updates can indicate approximate windspeed and direction. Proper wind
      drift correction can be determined by dividing the crosswind component by the true
      airspeed in NM per minimum minute. For example, if the no-wind heading is 360
      degrees, the crosswind component is 30 knots out of the west, and the airspeed is 3 NM
      per minimum minute (180 NM/hour divided by 60 seconds per minimum equals 3 NM
      per minimum), the drift correction is 10 degrees into the wind (30 divided by 3 equals 10
      degrees) for a resulting heading of 350 degrees to proceed toward the fix.
      7.25.4.8. Regularly update the required heading to the target fix. Simply repeat the steps
      used to determine the initial heading (always use current DME). It can be helpful to
      schedule updates at distances that form simple ratios with the target DME. For example,
      if going from 60 DME to 15 DME, plan updates at 45 DME (1:3 ratio), 30 DME (1:2
      ratio), and 20 DME (3:4 ratio). Mathematical ratio methods may also be used to
      determine heading. A heading midway between the bearing pointer and course arrow
      results in hitting target radial at DME same as current DME. A heading midway between
      the midpoint and course arrow results in hitting target radial at DME twice the current
      DME. Likewise, heading midway between the midpoint and the bearing pointer results in
      hitting target radial at DME one-half the current DME.
7.26. In-Flight Checks:
   7.26.1. Objective. Accomplish in-flight checks and other actions required during instrument
   flight.
   7.26.2. Description. In-flight checks performed according to flight manual and other
   required actions such as IAP review accomplished in a timely fashion throughout the sortie.
   7.26.3. Procedure. Accomplish required in-flight checks. Perform actions required by
   AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, including review of IAP for planned approaches, re-check
   destination WX, and coordination of lost communication instructions, if required. See
   AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed requirements.

          step.
7.27. Holding:
   7.27.1. Objective. Maneuver to properly enter holding and remain within holding airspace.
   7.27.2. Description. Turn at entry to enter published or assigned holding pattern. Fly wind-
   corrected headings to remain within protected airspace.
   7.27.3. Procedure. Procedures for holding entry, holding, and holding exit are described in
   FLIP, General Planning; AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1; and the flight manual. Normally hold
   at 150 KIAS. Airspeeds as low as 120 KIAS (or MAX endurance AOA, whichever is higher)
   may be flown in holding.
   7.27.4. Techniques. Use the GPS to determine winds. Compare aircraft heading to actual
   aircraft track to determine crosswind correction required. Use techniques for the vertical-S
   when climbing or descending in a holding pattern.
7.28. Penetration Approach:
   7.28.1. Objective. Transition from the enroute structure directly onto a published
   instrument approach.
   7.28.2. Description. A steep instrument approach procedure with specific altitudes and
   courses, flown by military aircraft for tactical considerations.
      7.28.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 250 KIAS.
      7.28.2.2. Power. As required. (See Table 7.1) Typically for 200 KIAS: 8 degrees NL
      and 5 percent torque.
      7.28.2.3. Speed Brake. As required.
   7.28.3. Procedure. Lower nose and set power to maintain 200 KIAS. Airspeed may be
   adjusted to comply with published altitude restrictions. (Do not exceed 250 KIAS below
   10,000 feet MSL.) Plan descent to allow configuration before final approach fix (FAF).
7.29. Enroute Descents:
   7.29.1. Objective. Smoothly transition from the enroute structure to a (low) instrument
   approach.
   7.29.2. Description. Descent according to assigned routing and altitude restrictions issued
   by ATC. The more commonly used method to descend for an instrument approach.
      7.29.2.1. Airspeed. 200 to 250 KIAS.
      7.29.2.2. Power. As required. (See Table 7.1) Typically for 200 KIAS, 5 degrees NL
      and 20 percent torque.
142                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      7.29.2.3. Speed Brake. As required.
  7.29.3. Procedure. Lower nose and set power to achieve desired airspeed and rate of
  descent. Plan descent to allow configuration before the FAF.
  7.29.4. Techniques:
      7.29.4.1. If given the option of a descent at pilot discretion, a 5-degree descent is
      comfortable and controllable. To determine when to start down using a 5-degree descent,
      multiply the altitude to lose in thousands of feet by 2 and add 10 miles. For example, if
      the altitude to lose is 20,000 feet, start down approximately 50 NM from the destination
      (20 multiplied by 2 equals 40, plus 10 equals 50 NM). The extra 10 miles allows for an
      instrument approach into the destination.
      7.29.4.2. Given an altitude to be at within a specified range, determine the pitch attitude
      by one of two methods:
         7.29.4.2.1. 60-to-l Rule:
             7.29.4.2.1.1. Pitch change equals altitude to lose (in hundreds of feet) divided by
             NMs. For example, to lose 5,000 feet in 10 NM, divide 50 by 10, which equals 5
             degrees NL.
             7.29.4.2.1.2. Every 1 degree of pitch equals descent (or climb) of 100 feet per
             NM.
         7.29.4.2.2. EADI Technique (Figure 7.5.):
             7.29.4.2.2.1. The 10 degrees NL line on the EADI represents NM to descend.
             7.29.4.2.2.2. Lower the nose, based on this scale, to the altitude to lose (in
             thousands). For example, to lose 10,000 feet in 20 NM, set the scale with 20 at the
             10-degree NL line. A descent of 10 (thousand feet) is one-half of 20; therefore,
             pitch required is 5 degrees NL.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    143


Figure 7.5. EADI Descent Calculation.




      7.29.4.3. Verify descent gradient by cross-checking VSI. Calculate descent rate from
      airspeed and pitch (descent gradient).
          7.29.4.3.1. VSI equals groundspeed (NM per minute), multiplied by pitch (descent
          gradient), multiplied by 100. For example, 4 NM per minute is 240 groundspeed,
          multiplied by 5 degrees descent gradient, multiplied by 100 equals 2,000 fpm on VSI.
          7.29.4.3.2. Use caution when calculating VSI with IAS or TAS. Significant winds
          change desired VSI for selected descent gradient. Headwinds result in lower VSI and
          tailwinds in higher. For example, if you calculate the descent in paragraph 7.29.4.3.2
          with 240 TAS, the expected VSI is 2,000 fpm. To maintain 5-degree descent gradient
          with a 60-knot headwind (180 GS); VSI is 1,500 fpm. Likewise, with a 60-knot
          tailwind (300 KGS), VSI is 2,500 fpm.
          7.29.4.3.3. Use GPS and/or NAVAIDs to maintain SA.
7.30. Final Approach:
   7.30.1. Objective. Transition from IMC to VMC via instrument approach procedure.
   7.30.2. Description. Straight-in approach flown using EADI and GPS or NAVAIDs to
   control aircraft attitude, altitude, and route of flight. WX minimums allow transition to visual
   cues for landing.
      7.30.2.1. Airspeed. 110 KIAS (120 KIAS may be used if a circling approach is
      planned).
      7.30.2.2. Gear. Down.
      7.30.2.3. Flaps. TO.
 144                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   7.30.3. Procedure. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, and AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for
   approach procedures, rules, restrictions, and approach system information. See AFI 11-2T-6,
   Volume 3, for WX and approach minimum restrictions.
       7.30.3.1. Before glide path intercept (precision) or FAF (nonprecision) approaches,
       configure, slow to approach speed, and complete the before-landing checklist.
       7.30.3.2. With crosswinds or gusty winds, configure using appropriate flap settings and
       increase airspeed, as required.
       7.30.3.3. GPS-specific approach procedures include:
          7.30.3.3.1. The GPS approach procedure must be loaded from a current database.
          7.30.3.3.2. Check waypoint names, sequence, courses, and distances prior to
          commencing the approach (may be accomplished during preflight).
          7.30.3.3.3. Check RAIM before initiating any terminal area procedure (STAT page
          5).
          7.30.3.3.4. Ensure course indicator set to proper tolerance (+/-1 mile on MODE page
          or APPR ARM any time terminal area procedures are flown).
          7.30.3.3.5. Ensure no deviations while on the approach.
          7.30.3.3.6. If deviations are noted, immediately terminate the procedure, and switch
          to backup options.
   7.30.4. Technique:
       7.30.4.1. Configuring 2 to 3 NM prior to the FAF in the T-6 allows for stabilization of
       airspeed and trim prior to descending at the FAF.
       7.30.4.2. Compare aircraft track on the GPS to aircraft heading. The difference
       approximates the drift correction. Set heading bug to wind corrected heading for final.
       Update as necessary; wind speed and direction are rarely constant during the descent.
       7.30.4.3. When deviations are noted, set specific headings to make corrections. If
       possible, limit heading changes to 5 degrees when making a course correction. Set
       heading bug to final approach course for additional visual cue for size of heading
       deviations. Because the heading bug is approximately 10 degrees wide (5 degrees either
       side of the bugged heading), limiting heading changes to the area beneath the heading
       bug will reduce the tendency to overcorrect. Limit pitch changes to 2 degrees
       (approximately 400 feet per minimum on the VSI) for glide slope corrections. Avoid
       large power corrections (unless required for excessively low or high airspeed).
7.31. Transition to Landing:
   7.31.1. Objective. Safely transition from IMC to VMC to land the aircraft using visual
   cues.
   7.31.2. Description. Transition to landing begins when visual cues for the RWY
   environment are available. The transition from IMC to VMC is similar to the transition
   during an ITO, except transition from the instruments to visual cues at the same rate as they
   appear.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  145


   7.31.3. Procedures. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed guidance.
      7.31.3.1. Maintain instrument glide path or transition to a visual glide path for landing.
      Use visual approach slope indicator or other visual glide path guidance when available.
      7.31.3.2. Ensure adequate visual references (RWY environment) are available before
      starting transition to landing. Some WX phenomenon, such as ground fog, may require
      missed approach even after initially breaking out from IMC to VMC.
      7.31.3.3. Do not correct to visual glide path with a high sink rate, which may result in a
      short or hard landing. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for further information on ―duck-
      unders‖ and landing illusions.
      7.31.3.4. Thoroughly review the airport diagram (IAP). Pay particular attention to RWY
      lighting, RWY dimensions, RWY slope, and charted obstructions.
   7.31.4. Technique. With the field in sight and the decision made to land, the pilot may slow
   to 105 KIAS. If flaps landing is selected for landing, slow to 100 KIAS.
7.32. Circling Approach:
   7.32.1. Objective. Safely maneuver to align with the landing RWY.
   7.32.2. Description. Visual flight maneuver used to align with RWY if approach does not
   meet requirements for a straight-in approach or an approach to a RWY different than the
   landing RWY must be flown. Circling is performed with the RWY environment in sight at all
   times.
      7.32.2.1. Airspeed. 120 KIAS while circling until on a visual final.
      7.32.2.2. Gear. Down.
      7.32.2.3. Flaps. TO.
   7.32.3. Procedure. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for detailed information.
      7.32.3.1. Fly the instrument approach at 110 KIAS and accelerate to 120 KIAS when
      commencing the circle or you may fly the entire approach and circle at 120 KIAS. If
      visibility permits, attempt to maintain lateral spacing that allows for a 30-degree bank
      turn to final, and begin the base turn to allow for normal length final (approximately one-
      half mile). Fly the T-6 to Category B circling minimums based on its maneuvering
      airspeed of 120 KIAS. Do not exceed the obstacle clearance distance of 1.5 NM from the
      RWY (for Category B aircraft) during the circling maneuver.
      7.32.3.2. Landing flaps may be extended on base or final if landing distance is critical.
      Descend from MDA when in position to intercept a normal glide path. Airspeed may be
      reduced from 120 KIAS to approach speed appropriate for flap setting (110 KIAS flaps
      UP; 105 KIAS flaps TO; 100 KIAS flaps landing) when transitioning to final.
   7.32.4. Technique:
      7.32.4.1. At circling MDA, visual cues for RWY displacement appear considerably
      different than those commonly used in the overhead pattern. Because of the lower
      altitude, proper displacement on a circling approach appears to be much wider than for an
 146                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       overhead pattern. A good visual reference for proper downwind spacing at 500 feet AGL
       is wingtip on the landing RWY.
       7.32.4.2. Practice circling approaches at the MDA. However, under actual conditions,
       increase altitude above the MDA as WX conditions permit, up to normal overhead
       pattern altitude (1,000 feet AGL).
7.33. Missed Approach:
   7.33.1. Objective. Safely discontinue an instrument approach and comply with published
   procedures or ATC instructions.
   7.33.2. Description. Climb away from the airfield similar to ITO. May be performed in
   IMC with reference to instruments only, or may require transition to instruments (as in ITO).
   See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for missed approach guidance.
   7.33.3. Procedure. Smoothly advance the PCL to MAX, set attitude to 10 to 15 degrees NH
   on the EADI, check VSI and altimeter to verify climb and raise gear and flaps. Once at
   targeted pitch and between 140 and180 KIAS, pitch and power may be reduced as necessary
   to preclude excessive attitude and associated disorientation in IMC. Maintain 150 to 200
   KIAS (or according to local directives) on vectors for an additional approach. Maintain
   appropriate cruise airspeed if diversion is necessary.
7.34. Climbout:
   7.34.1. Objective. Safely transition from departure leg to the radar pattern (for additional
   instrument approaches) or continue the sortie on a departure procedure.
   7.34.2. Description. The transition from a practice instrument approach to the radar pattern
   or departure procedure. Similar to the applicable portions of an ITO.
   7.34.3. Procedure. See ITO. Follow departure procedures if departing to the enroute
   structure. Power may be reduced to control acceleration and climb rate if entering the radar
   pattern for multiple instrument approaches; maintain 160 to 200 KIAS (or according to local
   directives).
   7.34.4. Technique. If not otherwise directed by ATC, local directives, or unusual
   circumstances (WX, traffic, etc.), maintain 200 knots on radar downwind and slow to 160
   knots on radar base.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    147

                                         NAVIGATION

Section 8A—General

8.1. Introduction. Navigation training covers techniques and procedures used to fly from one
location to another. Additional topics such as use of unfamiliar airfields, decision making outside
the local area, task management, cockpit organization (complicated by charts and additional
FLIP), and VFR mission planning are covered in this chapter. AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation,
and AETC TRSS Handout 11-1 are primary sources for information on navigation.
8.2. General. Mission preparation may begin several days before departure. Destinations and
routes may be selected any time in the planning process; however, some flight planning tasks,
such as wind computations, fuel calculations, and WX briefings, must be completed shortly
before departure. Note the distinction between IMC and IFR. IFR and VFR refer to rules and
procedures while IMC and VMC refer to conditions. VMC generally refers to the ability to fly
using references outside the aircraft while IMC generally refers to conditions where instruments
inside the cockpit are used as the primary references. Conditions must generally be VMC to fly
using VFR, but conditions can be either IMC or VMC to fly using IFR. Although there are
differences between IFR and VFR flight, there are common planning steps and tasks. The
following general guidelines apply to the planning and execution on any type of navigation
mission (e.g., IFR, VFR, or VFR low level).
8.3. Mission Planning:
   8.3.1. Choosing a Destination. Basic considerations to determine if an airfield is acceptable
   for use include RWY length, servicing capability, command restrictions, operating hours, and
   instrument approach availability. Strange fields are those with which the pilot is unfamiliar
   and requires additional planning effort. There are several other significant considerations for
   training missions. Excessive distance (time and (or) fuel required) can preclude completion
   of required approach training. WX conditions may not allow completion of major training
   objectives (e.g., VFR low level) or use of an otherwise excellent airfield (WX below
   minimums). When significant WX is a factor (e.g., winter WX to the north), it is good
   technique to develop multiple plans, such as a west option and an east option, for individual
   navigation missions or cross countries.
   8.3.2. NOTAM. See FLIP, General Planning, for detailed information on the NOTAM
   system. An initial scan of the NOTAMs can identify issues that eliminate potential
   destinations from planning consideration and prevent wasted effort. Performing a flight path
   search on the NOTAMs homepage will identify possible emergency airfields that may not be
   used due to RWY closure.
   8.3.3. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). See AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
   for detailed information about use of the ASRR. Though originally designed for larger
   aircraft, the ASRR contains information about potential restrictions for T-6 operations and
   information that will enhance general SA.
   8.3.4. WX. Actual and forecast WX conditions are a huge part in the planning of a
   navigational sortie or cross country. Study long-range forecasts several days in advance to
 148                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   determine the suitability of potential destinations and impact of WX on the probability of
   meeting training objectives. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists authorized WX sources and
   describes WX minimums. Check WX and winds for emergency fields along the route.
   8.3.5. Flight Plan. There are several ways to input a flight plan into the ATC system (a
   flight plan indicates aircraft type, aircrew, routing, airspeed, special handling requirements,
   etc., for a planned mission). At military bases, the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, may
   be completed and filed at base ops. This can be done in person, using a facsimile machine or
   through a Web site. Flight plans may also be filed via telephone with a local flight service
   station (e.g., 1-800-WX-BRIEF). This is a convenient option for stopovers at civil fields.
   Consult FLIP, General Planning, Chapter 4, for guidelines on completion of the DD Form
   175. Use ―TEX2/G‖ as aircraft designator and TD code.
   8.3.6. TOLD. Compute TOLD with the abbreviated checklist when off station.
   8.3.7. Navigation Checklists. Most units have excellent navigation planning checklists or
   briefing guides that contain detailed information about the mission planning process. A
   common memory aid to ensure completion of major planning steps is WANTS.
       8.3.7.1. W - WX (departure, enroute, destination).
       8.3.7.2. A - Activate flight plan (complete and file).
       8.3.7.3. N - NOTAMs (check for destination and drop-in airfields).
       8.3.7.4. T - TOLD (compute).
       8.3.7.5. S - SID (review departure procedure).
8.4. Radio Procedures. Standard radio calls used at home station simplify communications and
reduce radio congestion in the highly regulated local flying environment. Outside the local area,
radio calls may not be as standardized, but efficient communication is still the goal. Note: Using
VHF with civilian ATC outside the local area minimizes the chances of ―stepping on‖ other
aircraft radio calls.
8.5. Task Management and (or) Cockpit Organization. The principles for instrument sorties
apply to navigation sorties (see paragraph 7.5). However, navigation sorties may be more
complex and require more organization. For example, a navigation sortie could include an IFR
portion to a VFR low level followed by VFR point-to-point navigation to the destination and
conclude with practice instrument approaches. In general, strive to find ways to get ahead and
prepare for upcoming tasks.
8.6. Ground Ops:
   8.6.1. At strange fields, use caution for other transient aircraft. Use the airfield diagram
   during taxi. Some civilian fields are not accustomed to operations with military aircraft. It is
   the pilot‘s responsibility to ensure the safety of civilian ground personnel.
   8.6.2. After engine shutdown, complete the before-leaving aircraft checklist, and conduct a
   thorough postflight inspection of the aircraft. Ensure transient maintenance personnel are
   thoroughly familiar with all servicing requirements, as outlined in the flight crew checklist,
   strange field procedures section. Stay with the aircraft until refueling is complete and ensure
   the aircraft is properly secured.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    149


   8.6.3. Provide transient maintenance or FBO personnel with contact information in the event
   that questions or unusual situations arise after leaving the aircraft. The aircrew is ultimately
   responsible for the aircraft when off station. Even after careful preflight planning, unforeseen
   circumstances may result in degraded transient servicing capability, such as absence of
   proper servicing fluids or equipment. If any doubt exists as to transient maintenance‘s ability
   to properly and safely service the aircraft, contact the home station before servicing the
   aircraft.
   8.6.4. Other off-station considerations include:
       8.6.4.1. Before departing the aircraft, ensure, at minimum, the main gear is chocked.
       8.6.4.2. Before leaving base ops or the FBO, check the overnight and next day's WX. If
       strong winds are in the forecast, triple chock the aircraft. Tie down ropes may also be
       used to anchor the aircraft down. Section one of the flight manual states that, "wing and
       tail points provide sufficient mooring in normal conditions. However, when windy or
       extreme conditions are anticipated, the nose gear should also be secured." History has
       shown that the parking brake system will bleed over time, and with strong winds at night,
       a pilot may find their T-6 has moved, if not chocked.
       8.6.4.3. If thunderstorms are forecast, attempt to hangar the aircraft.
       8.6.4.4. Always have a ground observer and fire bottle available for engine starts.

Section 8B—IFR Navigation

8.7. Introduction. Missions conducted under IFR rely on NAVAIDs and aircraft
instrumentation for navigation, SA, and aircraft control. The enroute IFR structure is very
different from the local pattern, MOA, or stereo routes. Paragraphs 8.8 through 8.13 provide
guidelines for missions conducted under IFR.
8.8. Mission Planning:
   8.8.1. Choosing a Destination. The general considerations apply. A leg length of
   approximately 300 miles allows for multiple approaches at the destination.
   8.8.2. WX. If IMC conditions are anticipated, give special attention to the WX brief.
   Review WX minima and requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, to determine takeoff and
   landing minimums. Use caution for enroute hazards, such as embedded thunderstorms, icing,
   and turbulence, especially if IMC is anticipated.
8.9. Route Planning:
   8.9.1. Training sorties are typically flown on airways. GPS routing may also be used.
   8.9.2. Determine cruising altitude based on leg length. As a guide, use 10 percent of the
   distance for cruise altitude (e.g., cruise at 15,000 feet MSL on a 150 NM leg).
   8.9.3. When authorized for use, computerized tools (DUATS, PFPS/Falcon View, etc.) can
   aid the planning process. Check the results for reasonability and accuracy before flight, as
   bad input can lead to bad output.
   8.9.4. The AF IMT 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, is an approved flight log
   (according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3). Use of all columns on the AF IMT 70 can help ensure
150                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


  accurate time and fuel planning. Exact methodology for use of the AF IMT 70 is technique.
  Figure 8.1 shows a typical IFR leg from Randolph AFB TX to San Angelo TX.
  8.9.5. AF IMT 70 assumptions include:
      8.9.5.1. As a starting point, use 50 pounds for start, taxi, and takeoff (STTO).
      8.9.5.2. Use a double-entry climb calculation if field elevation is more than 5,000 feet.
      8.9.5.3. Average TAS has a negligible effect on climb calculations.
      8.9.5.4. Level-off distance approximately equals level-off altitude (up to FL 250).
      8.9.5.5. Use approximately 15 minutes and 100 pounds for initial penetration and
      approach.
      8.9.5.6. Use approximately 50 pounds and 10 minutes for subsequent approaches if
      being vectored to final.
      8.9.5.7. Track frequencies, NAVAIDs, and clearances in appropriate blocks.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               151


Figure 8.1. AF IMT 70 Example.




   8.9.6. Review the approach plate to determine takeoff restrictions, such as departure
   procedure (Trouble T), SID, etc. Plan to use preferred routings, if applicable, to avoid
   significant route changes when issued the clearance.
   8.9.7. Review planned approaches during preflight planning.
   8.9.8. If required, choose an alternate; use the same factors as when choosing a primary
   location.
8.10. Ground Ops:
   8.10.1. IFR clearance is generally received on a clearance delivery frequency (found on the
   approach plate). The clearance should mirror what was filed on the DD Form 175; however,
 152                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   clearances may be changed by ATC. The clearance can include, but is not limited to, routing,
   heading after takeoff, altitude, departure frequency, squawk, etc.
   8.10.2. Example radio calls:
       8.10.2.1. “Peterson Clearance Delivery, Texan 69, IFR to Amarillo, ready to copy.‖
       8.10.2.2. “Texan 69, cleared as filed; on departure fly RWY heading, climb and maintain
       ten thousand, expect FL 310, 10 minutes after departure, departure frequency 120.5,
       squawk 3456.”
   8.10.3. Review the airfield diagram before taxi request. Request progressive taxi instructions
   if necessary (to receive specific directions on where and when to turn from parking spot to
   the takeoff RWY).
8.11. Departure. Review departure routing and altitude restrictions before takeoff. Set
NAVAIDs and GPS before takeoff. The departure routing and altitudes may change just before
takeoff or while on departure. An approach plate for the departure airfield should be readily
available and reviewed for critical details in case of emergency return. Solid planning increases
flexibility and ability to maintain SA when changes occur to the original plan.
8.12. Enroute:
   8.12.1. Generally, the busiest portions of off-station sorties are from the clearance call to
   level-off and from descent to engine shutdown. Predictably, this is also where the majority of
   safety incidents occur. There are fewer external demands during the enroute or cruise
   portion, but the requirement exists to accomplish many tasks including checklists, analysis of
   fuel efficiency, and preparation for arrival. Sound task prioritization during the enroute
   portion of the flight is essential to good training and successful completion of the mission.
   8.12.2. Without the cues associated with the local training environment, it is easy to forget
   required in-flight checks. Stay busy and use memory aids, as necessary, to comply with all
   requirements.
   8.12.3. At level-off, keep climb power until approaching the planned IAS, then set the
   planned fuel flow to hold the IAS. Adjust the PCL as needed to maintain the mission planned
   IAS. Accomplish a groundspeed check to determine the effects of winds and use the actual
   fuel flow on the electronic instrument display to calculate fuels. GPS is the easiest, most
   convenient way to determine groundspeed. Groundspeed can also be read off the EHSI (if
   selected) when flying directly to or from a NAVAID. Alternatively, timing can be used to
   calculate groundspeed when flying directly to or from a station if altitude is greater than the
   range from the station. Simply note the DME change over one minute to determine
   groundspeed in miles per minute. Use groundspeed and fuel flow to predict fuel at future
   points on the route. Compare planned, updated (with groundspeed and fuel flow), and actual
   fuel at these points. Significant deviations may require changes to the flight plan.
   Modifications to the planned routing, altitude, winds, temperature, or excessive delays can
   drastically change the actual fuels from the planned fuels.
   8.12.4. Maintain positional awareness at all times with NAVAIDs, GPS, VFR chart, and
   enroute chart. Periodically identify suitable emergency airfields. Use of the GPS nearest
   function can be a valuable tool.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  153


   8.12.5. If an enroute descent is planned, determine the desired start-down point and attempt
   to get an ATC clearance that matches the desired descent profile. (See planning technique,
   paragraph 7.29.4.1.)
   8.12.6. Prepare for arrival according to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Pre-arrival tasks are the
   same as for instrument sorties.
8.13. Arrival. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, and Chapter 7 for detailed information about
IFR arrival (Figure 8.2).

Figure 8.2. Typical IFR Navigation Flight.




   8.13.1. Navigation sorties typically terminate at other than the home field. Previous
   experience at an airfield may simplify preparation for arrival. Likewise, arrival at a strange
   field (neither pilot familiar) takes additional planning effort. From prior review, the pilot
   should be familiar with airfield layout, approach lighting, type of glide path guidance, field
   elevation, RWY data, tower, and ground control frequencies, etc. However, airfield
   information must be reviewed before arrival and landing.
   8.13.2. Match the planned arrival to the training objectives for the sortie. Some approach
   procedures that require extensive cruise at lower altitudes may not be desirable because of
   excessive fuel consumption. Coordinate requests for additional approaches as early as
   possible with ATC (approach control) and be flexible.

Section 8C—VFR Navigation

8.14. Introduction. VFR navigation can be more demanding than IFR navigation. Compared to
IFR, the VFR pilot has more freedom to maneuver but also has more responsibility to maintain
SA and safe separation from aircraft and obstacles. Generally speaking, under VFR rules, pilots
 154                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


are their own clearance authority and are responsible for WX updates, traffic avoidance and
separation, route planning, terrain avoidance, and airfield suitability. The goal of VFR navigation
training is to get from one point to another by dead reckoning (DR) techniques and procedures.
8.15. Mission Planning. Mission success starts with thorough mission planning. Planning for
VFR missions can be time consuming. It is good technique to start at least one day prior to the
mission. Local in-flight guides (IFG) normally contain detailed step-by-step guidance.
   8.15.1. Choosing a Destination. A leg length of approximately 200 to 250 miles allows
   completion of additional training requirements (ELP at non-towered airfields, instrument
   approaches, etc.) enroute or at the destination.
   8.15.2. WX. VFR missions require better WX than IFR missions (See AFI 11-202, Volume
   3). In general, the minimum WX to takeoff and land under VFR is a 1,500-feet ceiling and 3
   miles visibility. Additionally, enroute WX must allow compliance with minimum VFR cloud
   clearance requirements and completion of the mission at VFR altitudes. At times, WX
   conditions may not allow the flight to be accomplished solely under VFR. In this case, a
   composite flight plan with VFR and IFR portions must be filed.
8.16. Route Planning:
   8.16.1. Chart Selection. Choose a chart that gives the most usable detail for the planned
   altitude, distance, and speed. In general, use a tactical pilotage chart (TPC) (1:500,000) or
   VFR sectional.
   8.16.2. Start Point. It is good technique to pick a route start point outside the terminal area.
   Vectors or traffic conflicts may preclude an immediate turn on course. In addition, airspeed
   and altitude should be stabilized before DR begins.
   8.16.3. Chart Construction. DR is flight on a calculated course for a specified airspeed and
   time. Translated to pilot actions, it means flying a specific groundspeed on a specific heading
   for a specific time. A properly prepared chart provides enough information to ensure safe DR
   in-flight navigation. As a minimum, circle turn points, draw the route between points, insert
   timing marks, and compute magnetic headings. Including such information as fuel
   calculations, planning factors, and airfield data on the chart may eliminate the requirement
   for another type of fuel log.
   8.16.4. Chart Marking. Consider highlighting the chart or annotating it with the following
   information:
       8.16.4.1. Planned fuels.
       8.16.4.2. Emergency divert airfields and tower frequencies.
       8.16.4.3. NAVAIDs for additional SA.
       8.16.4.4. Obstacles.
       8.16.4.5. Spot elevations.
       8.16.4.6. Air route traffic control center frequencies.
       8.16.4.7. Restricted airspace.
       8.16.4.8. Class B or Class C airspace.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     155


       8.16.4.9. Expected frequencies (approach control, tower, etc.).
8.17. VFR Departure. VFR departures differ significantly from IFR departures. Although a
flight plan is still required (IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3), an ATC clearance for the route of
flight is not required. A radio call to ground or tower controllers stating direction of flight and
initial altitude may be sufficient before VFR departure. However, in busy areas, an initial
heading and altitude may be assigned for traffic separation.
8.18. Flying the Route:
   8.18.1. Flight Following. Flight following is a service provided at ATC‘s discretion,
   workload permitting, under which advisories are given for traffic conflicts along the route of
   flight. These advisories do not include vectors to eliminate conflicts unless requested. Flight
   following does not change the pilot‘s responsibility to see and avoid other traffic. However, it
   is an excellent tool to help prevent a midair collision. Request flight following with ATC.
   Expect assignment of a transponder code with flight following.
   8.18.2. Route Entry. The first few minutes of a VFR leg can be very challenging. Many
   tasks must be performed including getting established on the desired route at the appropriate
   altitude and airspeed. Additional tasks include in-flight checks, communication with ATC,
   clearing, and finding the first point. Proper planning and a solid review of the planned
   departure ground track make route entry tasks more manageable. Backup DR navigation with
   NAVAIDs, including GPS.
   8.18.3. Route Basics. At cruise altitude, set power to maintain the preplanned airspeed and
   check groundspeed. Compare actual and planned groundspeed to determine the effect of
   winds. At preplanned points (typically turn points), compare actual fuel burned and elapsed
   time to planned data. Significant deviations may require changes to the flight plan. Flying the
   correct groundspeed, on the correct heading, and for the correct amount of time is primarily
   accomplished through the ―clock-to-map-to-ground‖ method. First, look at the clock to
   determine time. Second, look at the map to determine where you should be on the map,
   (based on timing) and what visual cues should be in view 30 seconds to one minute in front
   of the aircraft. Last, look at the ground and visually acquire the predetermined ground
   references. Do not reverse the order of ―clock-to-map-to-ground.‖ Reversing the order
   generally leads to poor SA.
   8.18.4. In-Flight Checks on the Route. Without the cues associated with the local training
   environment, it is easy to forget required in-flight checks. It is common practice to mark the
   chart with preplanned points to accomplishing the required in-flight checks. For example,
   route entry might include an annotation for the level-off check or selected turn points might
   be marked with reminders for an ops check.
   8.18.5. VFR Arrival. VFR arrival at an unfamiliar airfield can be challenging. Factors such
   as RWY length, RWY alignment, terrain features, airspace classification, traffic congestion,
   and WX can impact arrival. As with every other aspect of navigation, prior planning and
   organization is essential to success. One common technique is to write arrival information,
   such as frequencies, pattern information, or airfield restrictions, near the destination airfield
   on the VFR chart.
8.19. Abnormal Procedures:
 156                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   8.19.1. Lost Procedures. GPS and VOR or DME can be useful in maintaining or regaining
   positional awareness. If lost, follow the 3Cs:
       8.19.1.1. Climb - Visibility, fuel efficiency, and radio range improve.
       8.19.1.2. Conserve - Slow to maximum endurance airspeed.
       8.19.1.3. Confess - Call ATC for help with current position, to get a vector, etc.
   8.19.2. WX Along the Route. WX may not be as forecast along the route and continued
   flight under VFR may not be possible. Do not continue when conditions deteriorate and
   proper cloud and terrain clearance cannot be maintained. When unable to maintain the
   planned route of flight under VFR:
       8.19.2.1. Alter the course to maintain VFR to the destination.
       8.19.2.2. Obtain an IFR clearance and continue to the destination.
       8.19.2.3. Maintain VFR and land at an alternate destination.
   8.19.3. Emergency. Constant positional awareness is critical to successful recovery if an
   aircraft emergency prevents continued flight to the planned destination. Two common
   techniques to increase SA and reduce workload in the event of an emergency are:
       8.19.3.1. Circle emergency airfields in red. Annotate tower or common traffic advisory
       frequencies.
       8.19.3.2. Use EHSI (airports displayed) or nearest function on the GPS to provide
       constant display of airfields near the route of flight.

Section 8D—Low-Level VFR Navigation

8.20. Introduction. Only about 10 percent of USAF flight is conducted at low level, yet over
half of total mishaps occur there. Flying high performance aircraft on low-level missions
significantly increases exposure to risk. Reaction times and margins for error are greatly reduced
when operating close to the ground. Thorough preflight planning and preflight briefings are
imperative for safe and effective low-level training. In the T-6, operation at or below 3,000 feet
AGL is considered low-level navigation. The goal of low-level navigation is to fly a selected
ground track and arrive at a designated time over target.
8.21. Mission Planning. A successful low-level mission begins with meticulous and extensive
mission planning. The first step is to become familiar with route requirements and all applicable
guidance (FLIP, Area Planning/1B [AP/1B], and chart update manual [CHUM]). Select a
groundspeed that is easily converted to miles per minute but allows for airspeed corrections (180,
210, or 240 knots GS). Normally, plan to use 210 knots GS. Planned airspeed below 160 KIAS is
not recommended due to decreased maneuverability. Check the forecast WX for the route. Use
the forecast temperature, pressure altitude, and winds to compute indicated airspeeds. Use flight
manual charts to determine the fuel flow for the planned true airspeed. See AETC TRSS
Handout 11-1 for detailed information on mission planning calculations. It is absolutely critical
to schedule the route and call the scheduling agencies for all crossing or conflicting routes to
reduce midair collision risk.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   157


  8.21.1. Chart Preparation. Use a 1:500,000-scale map (TPC or sectional chart) to fly low-
  level MTRs or VFR legs below 5,000 feet AGL. A 1:250,000-scale map (joint operations
  graphic [JOG]) may also be used for route study and on short low-level routes; however,
  JOG charts are normally too cumbersome for use in the aircraft. Each pilot in the aircraft
  should have an identical chart.
     8.21.1.1. Draw the route corridor, and then update the chart with the latest information
     from the CHUM. This step is imperative for flight safety. Next, identify all significant
     obstacles and high terrain within the route corridor.
     8.21.1.2. Check FLIP for mandatory turn points. Select easily recognizable points.
     Normally, it is preferable to use natural features to identify the target and turn points, as
     they seldom change. Choose turn points for uniqueness, vertical development, funneling
     features, and surrounding terrain. Avoid features that may be hidden by high terrain or
     trees. When picking turn points, consider the turning room required to remain within
     route corridor. Remain clear of any FLIP-directed, noise-sensitive areas or airfields.
     8.21.1.3. Choose the target first, then the initial point turn points, and entry point.
     Choose an initial point about 1 to 3 minutes from the target. An initial point is an easily
     identifiable point used to fine tune navigation and increase the probability of target
     acquisition. Minimize the heading change at the initial point in order to increase the
     accuracy of the initial point-to-target leg. The start point must be within the route
     corridor, but it is not necessarily the published entry point.
     8.21.1.4. Begin timing measurement at the route start point, and run continuously from
     start point to target.
     8.21.1.5. A thorough and detailed chart study is an essential part of mission planning. A
     JOG may help analyze both man-made and natural features. Visualize key points on the
     route and the general features around them to minimize the requirement for constant
     reference to the map.
  8.21.2. Chart Marking. In addition to the information recommended in AETC Handout,
  Navigation for Pilot Training, the following should be included on the map:
     8.21.2.1. The MTR corridor from entry to the planned exit point.
     8.21.2.2. Route lines and circles around turn points. Do not obscure critical details with
     the black line or turn circles.
     8.21.2.3. Timing lines along the planned ground track. Marks at a 1- or 2-minute
     intervals are sufficient.
     8.21.2.4. Information boxes aligned with each leg that include heading, leg time, and any
     other relevant information.
     8.21.2.5. Highlighted obstacles or high terrain along the route.
     8.21.2.6. Fuel calculations. Calculate average fuel flow using tab data. Determine fuel
     flow per minute by dividing pph by 60 and round up to the nearest whole number to
     make in-flight calculations easier. (Example: Tab data indicates a fuel flow of 450 pph,
     which is 7.5 pounds (lbs) per minute, so use 8 lbs per minute for in-flight updates or
     predictions.)
 158                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       8.21.2.7. Continuation fuel for the start point and other selected points along the route.
       Continuation fuel is the minimum fuel required to complete the route at planned speeds
       and altitudes and to return to base with required fuel reserves.
       8.21.2.8. Bingo fuel from the most distant point on the route to the recovery airfield.
       Bingo fuel is calculated for the most practical means of recovery (route and altitude).
       Consider factors such as cloud ceilings, winds, freezing level, and forecast icing.
       8.21.2.9. Compute an emergency route abort altitude (ERAA) for the planned portion of
       the low-level route and clearly annotate it for easy in-flight reference. Compute this
       altitude to provide 1,000 feet (2,000 feet ―mountainous‖[FLIP]) clearance above the
       highest obstacle within 25 NM either side of the route.
       8.21.2.10. Circles around emergency and alternate airfield locations. Additional
       information as necessary to expedite emergency recovery or divert.
       8.21.2.11. Route and timing to and from the low-level route.
8.22. Scheduling and Filing. Schedule MTRs with the scheduling agency. Deconflict entry
times with other scheduled users. See FLIP for filing instructions.
8.23. Briefing. A thorough brief is essential and ensures awareness of such possible hazards as
crossing routes, towers, birds, terrain, and other potential threats in the low-level environment. A
solid briefing also reviews sortie objectives and prepares the crew for effective training.
   8.23.1. Detailed study must precede the brief. Recognize features that identify turn points
   and other update points. Review route hazards and restrictions. Calculate planned altitudes.
   Review emergency recovery options. Many more details may be studied and typically time
   required for preparation is always greater than time available.
   8.23.2. Place emphasis on low-level emergencies and recovery contingencies. Use caution to
   avoid spending excessive time on the route briefing; extensive route study is understood. The
   briefing is not a substitute for chart study. Likewise, the route may be briefed after
   completion of briefing guide items.
8.24. Flying the Route. With proper planning, DR (flying accurate headings and airspeeds)
should result in a ground track close to black line and accurate timing.
   8.24.1. Departure. Attempt to fly planned route to the entry point. If the route is a long
   distance away or IFR flight is required to the entry point, identify a point short of the entry
   point from which DR can begin. The point may be visual, a GPS waypoint, or a VOR radial
   or DME. The easier it is to identify, the more accurate DR navigation will be.
   8.24.2. Route Entry. Before the entry point, accomplish a descent check and compare the
   EHSI heading with the magnetic compass to verify accuracy. Prepare the clock and review
   the hack procedure with the other pilot. Identify the entry point as early as possible.
   Maneuver to hit the entry point on the correct first leg heading. Use ―ready, ready, hack‖ to
   initiate timing. Regardless of the timing or cadence of the calls, ―hack‖ always follows the
   second ―ready.‖ Inside the route structure, accelerate to planned airspeed.
   8.24.3. Route Basics. Sound task prioritization and an organized approach are essential to a
   successful low-level mission. On the route, there are distinct mission elements that must be
   integrated. These mission elements, listed in priority order, include:
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   159


     8.24.3.1. Safety. Stay clear of terrain, obstacles, and other aircraft. Focus on terrain
     clearance is most critical during turns. While turns only make up 10 percent of flying in
     the low-level environment, they make up about 50 percent of the accidents.
     8.24.3.2. Systems Operation. Perform required checks. Monitor systems and fuel
     consumption.
     8.24.3.3. Navigation. Follow route and identify required points. Meet timing goal.
     8.24.3.4. Mission. Pay sufficient attention to safety and systems operation to ensure
     survival; these needs must be met first. Therefore, accomplish navigation with the
     attention capacity remaining after survival priorities are maintained. The challenge is to
     work efficiently, so sufficient time is available for success in all mission elements.
     8.24.3.5. Priority. The highest priority task is clearing the ground, obstacles, other
     aircraft, and birds. The neutral position during low level where 80 percent of time should
     be spent is ―head up and eyes out.‖ Always return focus to clearing after momentary
     diversions to accomplish other tasks or subtasks. Bring the map up to eye level to read it;
     don‘t move the eyes or head down. During turns, fly the aircraft and clear; do nothing
     else.
     8.24.3.6. Fly Accurately. Successful DR is based on solid planning and accurate flying.
     Failure to maintain heading and airspeed can corrupt the entire process. Visual navigation
     with the chart is based on being close to the expected position.
     8.24.3.7. Trim the Aircraft. Trim the aircraft and set the proper IAS or power setting
     for the planned groundspeed. A stable platform makes navigation much easier.
     8.24.3.8. Clock-to-Map-to-Ground. Use the ―clock-to-map-to-ground‖ method, as
     previously described in this chapter, to maintain course and timing.
     8.24.3.9. Identify. Start trying to identify turn points about 1 to 1.5 minutes out
     (approximately 3.5 to 5 miles at 210 knots GS). If possible, verify the point with multiple
     features. If the point is not identified, turn on time. Turns at low altitude require extra
     emphasis on clearing and aircraft control. Clear in the direction of the turn. Clearing is
     enhanced by selection of a visual rollout reference; turn to the visual reference, then fine
     tune heading.
  8.24.4. Big Picture. Keep an eye on the big picture. Use major terrain features (mountains,
  lakes, obvious geological formations, etc.) to improve positional awareness.
  8.24.5. Altitude Control. Visually assess the height above the ground. Occasionally cross-
  check the altimeter against the known elevation of towers, lakes, airfields, and peak
  elevations. Visual navigation is easier as altitude increases. When in doubt, climb early if the
  route structure allows.
  8.24.6. Heading Control. Pick a ground reference in the distance and fly to it. Set the
  heading bug on the wind-corrected heading. ARC mode on the EHSI can be helpful. Heading
  deviations occur often during low level (obstacle avoidance, poor wind analysis, etc.). One
  method to correct to course is to aim for a distant feature on the route. Landmarks that
  parallel the route or funnel toward the route (roads, rivers, drainage patterns, etc.) are also
  useful. See FLIP Navigation for Pilot Training for course correction methods based on the
 160                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   60-to-1 rule. At 210 knots GS, a heading change of 17 degrees held for 1 minute causes a 1-
   mile course shift.
   8.24.7. Timing. Accurate DR relies on a good clock ―hack‖ started at the actual start point.
   Features perpendicular to the ground track, such as roads, rivers, power lines, and pipelines,
   are good timing update points. For every second early or late, increase or decrease indicated
   airspeed by 1 knot, and hold that change for the number of minutes equal to the NMs per
   minute you are flying. For example, if flying at 210 knots GS (3.5 miles per minute) and 10
   seconds late, increase indicated airspeed by 10 KIAS and hold for 3.5 minutes.
   8.24.8. In-Flight Checks. Perform normal in-flight checks during low-level missions.
   Compare actual fuel to planned fuel. Do not perform checks during turns. Primary techniques
   to update required items before or after turn points include the SHAFT check, or variation of
   the 6 Ts:
       8.24.8.1. SHAFT:
          8.24.8.1.1. S - Speed for new leg.
          8.24.8.1.2. H - Heading for new leg.
          8.24.8.1.3. A - Altitude for new leg.
          8.24.8.1.4. F - Fuel at turn point. Compare to plan.
          8.24.8.1.5. T - Timing at turn point. Compare to plan, determine correction.
       8.24.8.2. 6 Ts:
          8.24.8.2.1. T - Time ahead or behind.
          8.24.8.2.2. T - Turn to specific heading for new leg.
          8.24.8.2.3. T - Throttle set to hold desired airspeed, check fuel, and fuel flow.
          8.24.8.2.4. T - Twist heading bug or course arrow to proper heading.
          8.24.8.2.5. T - Track course centerline at desired altitude.
          8.24.8.2.6. T - Talk if at a required reporting point.
   8.24.9. Route Exit and Recovery. Comply with FLIP, AP/1B, local procedures, and ATC
   instructions. Perform in-flight checks. Prepare for training enroute or at destination.
8.25. Abnormal Procedures:
   8.25.1. Emergencies. The first reaction to any emergency encountered at low level is to
   abort the route and climb as high as necessary (at least to the ERAA) to safely analyze the
   situation.
   8.25.2. Engine Malfunctions. If the engine fails on a low-level MTR, recovery is unlikely
   unless a suitable landing field is within approximately 3 miles. Normally, airfields within an
   arc circumscribed by the wingtips can be reached with an immediate turn and climb in the
   direction of the airfield. Map study for potential emergency diverts before the mission will
   greatly enhance chances for success. A zoom from 210 knots GS gains approximately 1,000
   feet. Consider a restart in the zoom. If there are no indications of a start (N1 rise) by the apex
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  161


  of the zoom, eject. Do not delay ejection to attempt air starts below 2,000 AGL or if no
  airfields are within engine-out range.
  8.25.3. Route Aborts. Route aborts occur for various reasons (insufficient fuel to complete
  the route, aircraft malfunction, bird hazards, and WX). Low altitude flight increases the
  danger of distraction and complicates recovery. Use the map, GPS, and NAVAIDs to
  maintain positional awareness or to find the nearest suitable recovery airfield. After aborting
  the route, do not reenter.
     8.25.3.1. VMC. Maintain safe separation from the terrain, comply with VFR altitude
     restrictions (if possible), squawk an appropriate transponder code, maintain VMC, and
     attempt contact with a controlling agency, if required.
     8.25.3.2. IMC. An abort into IMC is an emergency. Execute an immediate climb to the
     emergency route abort altitude (minimum) and squawk 7700. Attempt contact with the
     appropriate ATC agency. Fly the proper VFR altitude until an IFR clearance is received.

                                           Chapter 9

                                  TWO-SHIP FORMATION

Section 9A—General

9.1. Introduction:
   9.1.1. Purpose. The primary purpose of flying formation is mutual support. Formation
   skills and procedures are intended to turn the potential liability of two aircraft flying close
   together into the benefit of mutual support, but only through precise compliance with the
   obligations of the ―number 1‖ and ―number 2‖ aircraft, as presented in this chapter.
   Formation, more than any other type of flying, builds confidence, develops teamwork,
   teaches self-discipline, and promotes the proper application of aggressiveness to military
   flying. While the dynamics of working with and being responsible for another aircraft are
   new, the maneuvers are not. Formation maneuvering is an extension and combination of
   skills learned in other categories.
   9.1.2. Flight Discipline. Flight discipline requires an in-depth knowledge of flight rules,
   unit standards, and the procedures in this manual. Additionally, it requires strict adherence to
   the plan given in the preflight brief and any real-time alterations directed by number 1 during
   flight. It begins with mission preparation and continues through briefing, ground ops, flight,
   and debrief. Number 2 must speak up rather than allow the flight to enter an unsafe or
   unauthorized situation. If the directed tasks are beyond number 2‘s ability, he or she must
   immediately inform number 1. Flight discipline means flying in the proper parameters for the
   formation position directed by the flight lead with no tolerance for remaining out of position.
   As number 2, always strive to fly within the proper formation position parameters. As
   number 1, correct any wingman deviations immediately by directing number 2 to the proper
   position if appropriate corrections are not being made. Number 2 will query number 1
   immediately if unsure of assigned position. Uncompromising flight discipline is absolutely
   essential for successful mission execution.
   9.1.3. Aggressiveness. Aggressiveness in formation flying is a state of mind, an attitude not
   to be confused with the speed of flight control movement. As number 1, thinking ahead of
   the aircraft and profile while anticipating the need for changes and adjustments before they
   actually occur is an indication of the proper aggressive attitude for number 1. As number 2,
   correcting for positional deviations while mentally anticipating the next phase of flight or
   maneuver indicates proper aggressiveness. Do not act until directed by number 1. A smooth
   and timely response to number 1‘s directives demonstrates the proper aggressive attitude for
   number 2.

Section 9B—Formation Missions

9.2. Introduction. This section contains general concepts applicable to all formation missions.
9.3. Responsibilities:
   9.3.1. Flight Lead. The flight lead is ultimately responsible for the safe and effective
   conduct of the mission. This position gives both the authority and the responsibility of
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    163


  ensuring mission success to one individual who will be clearly identified prior to the mission.
  The flight lead is responsible for the planning, briefing, execution, and debriefing of the
  flight. The flight lead may delegate some or all of these mission elements but retains overall
  responsibility. The flight lead must focus on mission accomplishment, achievement of
  objectives, and safety. Consideration of the capabilities and experience levels of all flight
  members will help the flight lead plan a mission that optimizes training, and ensures
  accomplishment of objectives. The designated flight lead does not change during a mission
  under normal circumstances.
  9.3.2. Number 1 and Number 2. Within a two-ship formation (also referred to as an
  element), there are two distinct roles with well-defined responsibilities: number 1 and
  number 2. As described in the preceding paragraph, the designated flight lead does not
  change during the mission, however to enhance training opportunities, numbers 1 and 2 will
  often swap formation positions during a sortie. The mutually understood procedures,
  standards, and briefed tasks form a contract between number 1 and number 2 that results in a
  safe operating environment. Note: Do not confuse the terms ―flight lead‖ and ―number 1.‖
  They are not the same.
     9.3.2.1. Number 1. Number 1 is responsible for executing mission elements while in
     flight. Number 1‘s top priorities include clearing for the formation, planning, and
     monitoring number 2. Plan all maneuvers to keep the flight well within the assigned
     working airspace. Use power to manage energy in a manner similar to contact flying.
     High performance and high-G maneuvers require smooth and deliberate control inputs to
     keep number 2 from exceeding G limitations. Monitor number 2 to ensure the correct
     position before the next maneuver. Before directing a maneuver, always consider number
     2‘s position and ability to safely perform such a maneuver. Execute each maneuver
     smoothly, allowing number 2 to maintain position without undue difficulty. It is
     appropriate to fly safely with minor excursions from perfect performance parameters
     rather than to be overly concerned with smoothness and compromise safety. Basic
     number 1 responsibilities include:
         9.3.2.1.1. Clear for the Formation. Maneuver the formation away from other
         aircraft and maintain a safe altitude above the ground or any obstacles.
         9.3.2.1.2. Plan Ahead of the Aircraft. Alter the profile or maneuvers as
         appropriate, and ensure fuel and time are used judiciously to accomplish mission and
         training objectives.
         9.3.2.1.3. Monitor Number 2. Ensure number 2 is properly maintaining the
         assigned position. This includes assessing parameters during maneuvers, ensuring
         number 2 is in a safe position prior to executing a new maneuver, and ensuring in-
         flight checks are completed by the entire formation in a timely manner.
         9.3.2.1.4. Navigation. Ensure the formation is at the proper altitude, airspeed, and
         position relative to NAVAIDs, routing, instrument approaches, obstacles, airfields,
         etc.
         9.3.2.1.5. Communication. Transmit and receive information for the formation. To
         the air traffic controller, a formation is treated as a single entity with a single voice:
164                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


         number 1. Unless prebriefed, included in unit standards or directed by number 1,
         radio frequencies will not be changed.
      9.3.2.2. Number 2. Number 2‘s primary responsibility is to maintain flight path
      deconfliction and proper position as directed by number 1. This includes providing
      mutual support and maintaining formation integrity by executing the plan as briefed, and
      accomplishing the tasks as directed by number 1 without compromising safety. Number
      2‘s top priorities include flight path deconfliction, maintaining proper position relative to
      number 1, and executing additional tasks as directed by number 1. During initial stages of
      formation skill development, number 2 will focus almost entirely on deconfliction and
      position maintenance. Use all of number 1‘s aircraft as a reference; do not focus on just
      one spot. As skill at maintaining proper position improves, other lower priorities (like
      clearing for the formation by scanning the area around and beyond number 1) may be
      cross-checked but never at the expense of flight path deconfliction and proper position.
      Basic wingman responsibilities include:
         9.3.2.2.1. Do Not Hit Number 1. Flight path deconfliction is paramount. Unless
         number 2 has called ―blind‖, or for brief periods during tactical formation turns,
         number 2 is responsible to deconflict flight paths and prevent a collision.
         9.3.2.2.2. Keep Number 1 in Sight. Collisions within formations often occur when
         number 2 has lost sight of number 1. Hitting number 1 is much less likely when
         number 2 can see number 1. Losing sight is not uncommon and is only a problem if
         number 2 fails to call ―blind‖ with their altitude (this concept will be described later
         in this chapter).
         9.3.2.2.3. Be in Position and on Frequency. This is commonly referred to as
         ―being there.‖ If number 2 is in position and on frequency, it is much easier to keep
         number 1 in sight and for number 1 to monitor number 2. Being in position is also a
         requirement for mission accomplishment.
         9.3.2.2.4. Clear for the Formation. Number 2 is able to clear quadrants that are
         impossible for lead such as number 1‘s 6 o‘clock. Number 1 should put number 2 in
         route, fighting wing or tactical, as appropriate, whenever possible as it allows number
         2 to clear more effectively.
         9.3.2.2.5. Back Up Number 1. A good wingman is ready to take the lead at a
         moment‘s notice to accomplish any tasks assigned by lead. Number 2 should strive to
         actively monitor navigation, communication, fuel state, mission accomplishment, etc.
         When number 2 is able to consistently back up number 1, it usually shows a readiness
         to become a flight lead. Never let these duties interfere with the higher priority
         responsibilities. If clearing, being in position or keeping lead in sight is degraded by
         ―backing up lead,‖ immediately reprioritize in the order shown above.
  9.3.3. Collision Avoidance:
      9.3.3.1. Although numbers 1 and 2 are both responsible for adequate separation,
      generally number 2 has primary responsibility for flight path deconfliction within the
      element unless number 2 is unable to maintain visual. In that case, number 2 conveys a
      blind status to number 1 except as expected in tactical. Outside of tactical this
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  165


     responsibility does not transfer to number 1 unless number 2 calls ―blind.‖ See paragraph
     9.16 for further information on blind scenarios.
     9.3.3.2. Although not number 1‘s primary responsibility when number 2 is visual,
     number 1 is still expected to monitor number 2. Periodic cross-check of number 2‘s
     position will ensure that number 1 does not execute a maneuver that will compromise
     safety should number 2 be out of position.
     9.3.3.3. The following factors contribute significantly to the potential for a midair
     collision:
         9.3.3.3.1. Failure of number 1 to properly clear or visually monitor number 2 during
         a critical phase of flight, such as a rejoin or the extended trail (ET) exercise. Number
         1 must monitor number 2, either directly or with the mirrors. Number 1 must be
         directive or take evasive action if number 2 loses sight. If number 1 loses sight and is
         uncertain of number 2‘s position, query number 2 by requesting ―posit‖ (―Texan 2,
         posit‖). The ―posit‖ call is a question as to the position of number 2 relative to
         number 1. Number 2 responds with his position (“Texan 2, 5 o’clock, low, 500 feet”).
         9.3.3.3.2. Failure of number 2 to execute lost wingman procedures promptly and
         correctly if visual contact is lost in IMC. In IMC, if number 2 cannot maintain the
         close formation position (hereafter referred to as ―fingertip‖ and specifically defined
         in paragraph 9.20), using normal visual references, or loses sight of number 1, initiate
         appropriate lost wingman procedures as described in this manual.
         9.3.3.3.3. Failure to recognize excessive overtake. During rejoins, compare actual
         airspeed with the directed airspeed. Use power and/or speed brake as necessary.
         Number 1 should direct an overshoot or breakout if necessary.
         9.3.3.3.4. Failure to maintain lateral or vertical separation. For turning or straight-
         ahead rejoins, number 2 must maintain lateral or vertical separation until closure rates
         are under control and stabilized in route.
         9.3.3.3.5. Failure to consider the effects of wingtip vortices. Number 2 may
         encounter vortices when maneuvering too close to number 1. Control difficulties
         associated with wingtip vortices are very dangerous. Fly within the parameters
         described in this chapter to avoid them. If encountered, control the aircraft, maneuver
         away from number 1 or perform a break out as necessary.
  9.3.4. Call Signs:
     9.3.4.1. Aircrew of each aircraft in the formation will be assigned a call sign that has a
     unique word prefix and a two-digit numeric suffix. For example, Texan 11 (pronounced
     ―Texan one-one”) and Texan 12 would be members of Texan 11 flight. No two airborne
     formations should have the same word prefix in their call sign.
     9.3.4.2. During the preflight briefing, the designated flight lead will be given the call
     sign that ends in 1, and the other flight member will be given the call sign that ends in 2.
     Under normal circumstances, if the formation breaks up, the aircraft will assume the call
     signs given in the preflight briefing.
     9.3.4.3. All radio calls to an agency outside the formation should begin with the full call
     sign, including the word prefix and the double-digit suffix(―Texan 11 level, one-five
166                                                           AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      thousand‖). When directing other members of the flight, it is also common to use the full
      word prefix and single digit suffix of their position in the flight (―Texan 2, break out‖).
      When immediately responding to an in-flight directive, number 2 may simply use ―2‖ to
      predicate or concisely answer radio transmissions. For example, number 2 simply
      responds to the directive to breakout with: “2.”
  9.3.5. Radio Discipline:
      9.3.5.1. Clear, concise, correct communications are a good indicator of flight discipline.
      Minimize and combine radio calls on common-use frequencies to reduce radio
      congestion. Unless otherwise briefed or directed, when communicating with agencies
      outside the formation, number 1 will speak for the flight until the formation splits up.
      9.3.5.2. Number 1 owns the radios; which means number 2 will only change frequencies
      when directed by number 1 or when written unit standards dictate. If number 1 uses the
      term ―go‖ for a frequency change, number 2 will acknowledge before changing the
      frequency (―Texan, 11 go channel 5‖ acknowledged with ―2‖). If number 1 uses the term
      ―push,‖ number 2 should change to the new frequency without acknowledging (―Texan
      11, push channel 5‖, no acknowledgment). Number 1 adds the suffix ―victor‖ for the
      VHF radio calls (―Texan 11, push channel 2 victor‖).
      9.3.5.3. If number 1 sends number 2 to the wrong frequency, number 2 should go to that
      frequency and wait. Number 1 will get number 2 on the proper frequency either using the
      radio or using visual signals. Number 2 should never change frequencies without being
      directed by number 1 or written unit standards, and number 2 should not go hunting for
      number 1 if number 1 and number 2 end up on different frequencies.
      9.3.5.4. Normally, when in fingertip formation, wingmen will automatically move to the
      route position when number 1 directs a channel change, and they will return to fingertip
      after being checked in on the new frequency. If in a position wider than fingertip,
      wingmen will remain in that position unless directed otherwise by number 1. If in IMC,
      wingmen will maintain fingertip spacing and use the crew concept to accomplish
      frequency changes (the PF talks on the radio and the PNF accomplishes the frequency
      change). If solo in IMC, change the frequency when workload permits. Wait until VMC,
      if necessary, and use the discrete frequency to communicate within the formation.
      9.3.5.5. When filling the number 1 position, do not use the term ―lead‖ when referring to
      own ship parameters. Use ―one‖ (―Texan, ops check, one is 600, 4 Gs‖). The only time
      the term ―lead‖ should be used over the radio is when executing a lead change (―Texan 2,
      you have the lead on the right‖).
      9.3.5.6. Wingmen will normally respond to all directive calls unless the action is obvious
      or briefed otherwise. If a radio call is unclear, number 2 will query number 1.
      9.3.5.7. For traffic calls, transmit call sign, traffic direction (left or right), clock position,
      elevation (low, level, or high), and an approximate distance. For example, when number
      2 obtains visual contact with a potential traffic conflict, he or she says “Texan 1, traffic
      right, 2 o’clock, 3 miles, slightly high.‖
      9.3.5.8. Military aviators use brevity code words to achieve clear, concise, correct, and
      effective communication. These code words are listed and defined in AFTTP(I) 3-2.5,
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       167


       Multiservice Brevity Codes. Common brevity code words that aid in collision avoidance
       include blind, visual, no joy, tally ho, and padlocked. When referring to aircraft within
       the formation, use the terminology blind (lack of visual contact) or visual (positive visual
       contact) as appropriate. When referring to aircraft outside of the formation, use the
       terminology no joy (lack of visual contact) or tally ho (positive visual contact). Padlocked
       indicates that the pilot cannot take his or her eyes off an aircraft or ground object without
       losing sight of that aircraft or object.
9.4. Visual Signals:
   9.4.1. Objective. Relay information between flight members or direct maneuvers.
   9.4.2. Description. Visual signals are used when radio transmissions are inappropriate or
   difficult to make. Visual signals are described in AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, and this manual.
   9.4.3. Procedure. As number 2, acknowledge with a head nod when number 1 gives a
   signal. If unsure of a signal, number 2 should not acknowledge or change position. Number 1
   repeats the signal until an acknowledgment is received. Use the radio, if necessary, to
   immediately clear up any confusion. Only the pilot at the controls will give visual signals to
   another aircraft or acknowledge signals from another aircraft in the formation. Visual signals
   must be clear, appropriate, and proportional to range. For example, a slight wing rock to
   reform to fingertip from two-ship-width route versus a large wing rock to signal a reform
   from a 500-foot route. Brief any nonstandard visual signals before they are used.
9.5. In-Flight Checks:
   9.5.1. Objective. Ensure the flight is making periodic checks of aircraft systems during
   departure, in special use airspace, while maneuvering, and on recovery.
   9.5.2. Description. Number 1 and number 2 perform the checklist appropriate for the phase
   of flight (ops check, descent check, etc.).
   9.5.3. Procedure. Use the intraflight radio to initiate checks if practical. Use visual signals
   if formation spacing allows or if radio traffic inhibits the use of the intraflight radio. If forced
   to turn during a check, number 1 should call the turn and ensure number 2 is attentive before
   turning. Number 2 resumes the check after the turn is complete. In-flight checks are normally
   accomplished in the following manner:
       9.5.3.1. Number 1. Allow enough time for number 2 to complete the check. Check
       number 2 in with a visual signal or a radio call. On the radio, check in by transmitting call
       sign and OBOGS status for the climb check and total fuel for ops checks and descent
       check (―Texan 1, OBOGS good” or “Texan 1, 800‖).
       9.5.3.2. Number 2. Number 2 will acknowledge number 1‘s visual signal or radio call
       to initiate checks, move to route spacing (if the check was directed while in fingertip and
       WX allows), and perform the appropriate checklist items. Accomplish the check one item
       at a time, checking position on number 1 between each item. Prioritize tasks. Fly
       formation first and accomplish checklist items as workload permits. During turns, fly the
       aircraft and resume the check after the turn is complete.
9.6. Fuel and G Awareness:
 168                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   9.6.1. Objective. Maintain fuel awareness of other aircraft and ensure all formation
   members are capable of continuing the mission after high-G maneuvering.
   9.6.2. Description. All flight members must understand the factors and assumptions used to
   determine joker and bingo fuels. Flight members should increase the frequency of fuel
   checks during high fuel flow ops (ET, low altitude) and when approaching joker and bingo
   fuels.
   9.6.3. Procedure. Number 1 must continually monitor the flight‘s fuel state and adjust the
   profile, frequency of ops checks, and joker or bingo as necessary.
       9.6.3.1. Unless already on the recovery, number 2 will inform number 1 when reaching
       joker and bingo fuel, and number 1 will acknowledge the call.
       9.6.3.2. It is number 1‘s responsibility to monitor the fuel state and G loading of the
       entire formation. Number 1 must also take action when any aircraft exceeds G
       limitations, reaches joker or bingo fuel, or reports an abnormal fuel condition. Number 1
       initiates a fuel and G check after the G-awareness exercise, periodically during the sortie
       and following each set of extended trail. Number 2 responds with ―same‖ if his fuel is
       within 50 pounds, and Gs are within .5 of number 1. For example, if number 1 says
       “Texan 1, 800, 4.5,” and number 2 has approximately 750 pounds and shows 4 Gs, the
       response is “Texan 2, same.”
       9.6.3.3. Any time number 2 is maneuvering behind number 1, number 2 must use caution
       to avoid areas of prop wash or wake turbulence. This is especially important in number
       1‘s 6 o‘clock. Any time wake turbulence or prop wash is encountered, number 2 should
       unload to approximately 1 G, exit the area of turbulence, and check the G meter. If the
       aircraft G limits have been exceeded, the formation will terminate maneuvering and
       conduct a controllability check, as required. In the case of an over G, the G meter is not
       reset until the aircraft is inspected by a certified maintenance technician.
9.7. FENCE Check. Number 1 directs ―FENCE-in‖ when entering the MOA. Number 1 directs
―FENCE-out‖ when exiting. See Chapter 6 for details on the FENCE check.
9.8. Battle Damage (BD) Check:
   9.8.1. Objective. Using mutual support, members of a formation inspect all aircraft in the
   formation.
   9.8.2. Description. Aircraft within a formation maneuver to inspect each other for damage,
   leaks, missing panels, or irregularities. Generally performed after aggressive maneuvering or
   combat ops.
   9.8.3. Procedure. With number 2 in the route position (approximately two ship-widths),
   number 1 initiates the BD check using a radio call or the ―check mark‖ visual signal. Number
   2 climbs to see the opposite wingtip of number 1‘s aircraft, descends back to route position
   and performs a cross under to look at the other side in the same fashion. Number 2 must
   maintain nose-tail separation while inspecting number 1. Number 2 looks for any damage,
   leaks, missing panels, or irregularities. Upon completion of the check, number 2 will return
   to route on the opposite side of number 1 from which the check was started.
       9.8.3.1. If there are no discrepancies on number 1‘s aircraft, number 2 passes a thumbs-
       up to number 1, indicating a clean BD check. If number 1 is not clean, number 2 will use
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   169


       the radio to describe any discrepancies. Number 1 then initiates a lead change and
       number 2 assumes navigational (nav) lead while clearing for the flight. Number 1 then
       inspects number 2. Procedures for accomplishing lead changes, to include nav lead
       changes, are described in paragraph 9.17 of this manual.
       9.8.3.2. . If time or fuel is critical and the number 1 aircraft contains two pilots, the
       option exists to conduct the BD check without a nav lead change. In this case, the PNF in
       the number 1 aircraft inspects number 2 as number 2 maneuvers to inspect number 1, and
       the PF in the number 1 aircraft clears the flight path for the formation. This option must
       be briefed or directed before employed.
9.9. Mission Planning. The FL establishes priorities for mission planning and delegates tasks
to flight members to ensure thorough planning without duplication of effort. All flight members
should be involved in the mission preparation. The level of planning detail is dictated by mission
specifics and pilot experience level, but all necessary mission planning must be completed in
time to conduct a concise, comprehensive mission briefing.
9.10. Mission Briefing:
   9.10.1. Objective. The FL (or designated briefer) ensures all flight members are briefed on
   STTO, recovery, and relevant special subjects.
   9.10.2. Description. The briefing sets the tone for the entire mission. The briefing should
   set objectives, establish goals and set the standard used to measure successful performance
   during the mission.
   9.10.3. Procedure. All formation members will be present for the preflight briefing. The
   briefing will be conducted in a professional manner and will be clear and concise. The
   majority of the preflight brief should be spent describing the "how to" of the mission.
   Elements of the mission that are to be conducted according to written unit standards or
   procedures in this manual may be briefed as standard. Minimum time should be spent on
   written standards as all formation members will have them committed to memory.
       9.10.3.1. Individual Crew Briefings. The briefer must allow time for each crew to
       discuss intercockpit responsibilities, emergency procedures, and other crew coordination
       issues. Use 5 minutes as a minimum.
       9.10.3.2. Mission Debriefing. The debrief should cover areas that need improvement.
       The mission should be reconstructed in only enough detail to debrief issues affecting the
       formation as a whole. Conduct the debrief in a business-like atmosphere and critiques of
       execution should not be taken personally. Receive instruction openly; use the debrief as a
       tool for improvement.
9.11. G-Awareness Exercise. Perform a G-awareness exercise or AGSM demonstration (as
described in Chapter 6) before accomplishing any maneuver that may require 3 Gs or more. Brief
the exercise with an emphasis on deconfliction procedures. Sufficient visual cues must be
available to perform this maneuver. Number 1 should consider sun angle and position prior to the
maneuver to preclude possible loss of sight due to the sun. If poor WX conditions prevent safe
accomplishment of the G-awareness exercise, number 1 should modify the flight mission profile
and limit maneuvering accordingly.
9.12. KIO and Terminate Procedures:
 170                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   9.12.1. Objective. Cease tactical maneuvering.
   9.12.2. Description. KIO is used when safety of flight is a factor or when doubt or
   confusion exists. KIO is transmitted when any of the training rules listed in AFI 11-2T-6,
   Volume 3, are violated. The terminate call is used to direct a specific aircraft or flight to
   cease maneuvering and proceed as briefed or directed. Terminate is used when safety of
   flight is not a factor.
   9.12.3. Procedure. The procedures for KIO and terminate are very similar.
       9.12.3.1. KIO. The KIO drill is normally initiated over the radio. Aircraft with radio
       failure signal KIO with a continuous wing rock. The aircraft observing a continuous wing
       rock should transmit KIO and provide required assistance. Any member of the formation
       may initiate a KIO. For example either aircraft transmits, “Texan, knock-it-off.” Number
       1 acknowledges, “Texan 1, knock-it-off,” followed by number 2 stating, “Texan 2,
       knock-it-off”. Under normal circumstances, the aircraft initiating the KIO briefly states
       the reason for initiating the drill in order to enhance situational awareness and eliminate
       confusion for the formation. Number 2 should then await directions from number 1.
          9.12.3.1.1. At the KIO call, number 1 continues the current maneuver without
          changing power setting. This ensures predictability and aids in flight path
          deconfliction, which should be the primary concern for all aircraft. If any aircraft
          loses sight, the aircraft losing sight should make the appropriate ―blind‖ radio call.
          Upon hearing a KIO call or observing a continuous wing rock, all participating
          aircraft will:
          9.12.3.1.2. Clear the flight path.
          9.12.3.1.3. Cease maneuvering.
          9.12.3.1.4. Acknowledge with a call sign in order of position in formation, or with a
          wing rock if the radios have failed.
          9.12.3.1.5. Obtain verbal clearance before resuming maneuvers.
       9.12.3.2. Terminate. Used to direct a specific aircraft or flight to cease maneuvering,
       clear the flight path, and proceed as briefed or directed. Any aircraft in the formation may
       initiate ―terminate.‖ Use ―terminate‖ to cease maneuvering when number 2 has met the
       desired learning objectives, or if number 2 is outside position parameters (desired
       learning objectives are not achievable). The terminate call is acknowledged in the same
       manner as a KIO call (“Texan terminate; Texan 1 terminate,”). Number 2 promptly
       replies with “Texan 2 terminate”. Number 1 smoothly transitions to a shallow turn or
       level flight until number 2 has attained the desired formation parameters. Once back in
       position, number 2 may signal for continued maneuvering by calling ―in‖ (“Texan 2,
       in”). At this point, number 1 may continue maneuvering or direct the formation, as
       desired.
9.13. Lost Wingman Procedures:
   9.13.1. Objective. Gain immediate separation of aircraft when number 2 loses sight of
   number 1 in the WX.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    171


   9.13.2. Description. In IMC when visual contact with number 1 is lost or if unable to
   maintain position due to disorientation, number 2 simultaneously executes the applicable lost
   wingman procedure while transitioning to instruments. Smooth application of control inputs
   is imperative to minimize the effects of spatial disorientation.
   9.13.3. Procedure. When executing lost wingman procedures, number 2 notifies number 1,
   who coordinates with the controlling agency and requests a separate clearance for number 2.
   If required, the controlling agency can help establish positive separation.
      9.13.3.1. Number 1. Number 1 should immediately perform the appropriate procedure,
      acknowledge number 2‘s radio call, and transmit aircraft attitude, which is acknowledged
      by number 2. Number 1 should transmit other parameters such as heading, altitude, and
      airspeed as necessary to aid in maintaining safe separation.
      9.13.3.2. Wings-Level Flight (Climb, Descent, or Straight-and-Level). The lost
      wingman turns away, using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds and informs number 1.
      After 15 seconds, number 2 resumes heading and proceeds on a separate clearance.
      9.13.3.3. Turns (Climb, Descent, or Level). When outside the turn, the lost wingman
      reverses the direction of turn, using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, and informs
      number 1. After 15 seconds, number 2 rolls out, continues straight ahead, and ensures
      positive separation before resuming the turn and obtaining a separate clearance. When
      inside the turn, the lost wingman momentarily reduces power to ensure nose-tail
      separation and tells number 1 to roll out of the turn. Number 2 maintains AOB to ensure
      lateral separation, and then proceeds on a separate clearance. Number 1 may resume
      turning only when separation is ensured.
      9.13.3.4. Precision and Nonprecision Final Approach. The lost wingman
      momentarily turns away from number 1 to ensure separation and starts a climb to either
      the FAF or glide slope intercept altitude, as appropriate. While proceeding to the missed
      approach point, number 2 informs number 1 and obtains a separate clearance from
      approach control. Comply with the new clearance received or fly the published missed
      approach, as appropriate.
      9.13.3.5. Missed Approach. The lost wingman momentarily turns away to ensure
      clearance, informs number 1, and continues to the published missed approach while
      climbing 500 feet above the missed approach altitude. Number 2 obtains a separate
      clearance from approach control.
   9.13.4. Responsibility. Lost wingman procedures do not guarantee obstacle clearance. It is
   the responsibility of all the pilots in the formation to be aware of terrain and obstacles along
   the flight path. Use good judgment when executing lost wingman procedures.
9.14. Practice Lost Wingman Procedures:
   9.14.1. Objective. Apply lost wingman procedures in a training exercise.
   9.14.2. Description. The below procedures outline the basis of how practice lost wingman
   will be performed. Practice lost wingman procedures in VMC to prepare for actual lost
   wingman situations in IMC.
   9.14.3. Procedure. Number 1 directs practice lost wingman with a radio call, “Texan 2, go
   practice lost wingman.” Number 2 acknowledges “2,” but does not begin execution. This
 172                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   acknowledgement simply verifies that number 2 knows a practice lost wingman exercise has
   been directed. When ready, number 2 executes the appropriate lost wingman procedures and
   makes the appropriate radio call (“Texan 1 roll out; Texan 2 lost wingman”). At a minimum,
   number 1 will respond with attitude, to include bank angle. Number 2 will acknowledge this
   radio call ―2.‖ Number 1 will monitor number 2 to ensure adequate separation is maintained
   and is primarily responsible for flight path deconfliction while number 2 is heads down
   during the procedure. After executing the appropriate lost wingman procedure, number 2 will
   initiate the end of the lost wingman exercise by conveying ―visual‖ with a radio call, “Texan
   2, visual.” Number 1 will direct a rejoin or other position.
9.15. Formation Breakout:
   9.15.1. Objective. Ensure immediate separation and avoid midair collision.
   9.15.2. Description. The HITS acronym describes when a breakout is required. Perform a
   breakout immediately when number 2:
       9.15.2.1. H - Constitutes a hazard to the formation
       9.15.2.2. I - Is in front of or under number 1
       9.15.2.3. T - Is directed (told) to break out
       9.15.2.4. S - Has a loss of situational awareness of his position relative to number 1.
   9.15.3. Procedure. When breaking out, the wingman clears in the direction of the break and
   maneuvers away from number 1‘s last known position (or in the direction that ensures
   immediate separation). Use power and/or speed brake as required to maintain safe
   maneuvering airspeed to expedite separation. When able, the wingman informs number 1:
   “Texan 2, breaking out” when self-initiating the breakout, or “2” when complying with a
   directive from number 1. Number 1 continues to fly predictably and, if the wingman is in
   sight, maneuvers to maintain sight and deconflict flight paths. If visual with number 1 the
   wingman may roll out regardless of who initiates the breakout. The aircraft breaking out
   should anticipate disorientation and must use caution if passing under number 1 or viewing
   number 1 through the top of the canopy.
       9.15.3.1. On final approach, use caution as a rapid increase in back stick pressure can
       quickly result in a stall. In addition, abrupt application of excessive rudder or abrupt
       application of MAX power can cause the aircraft to roll past the desired bank angle,
       which can further aggravate the slow speed condition and reduce the chances of a
       successful recovery.
       9.15.3.2. During a breakout, it is possible to lose sight. All flight members must remain
       vigilant to ensure deconfliction. A breakout does not always require an abrupt, high-G
       turn away from number 1.
       9.15.3.3. If a wingman initiates the breakout, it is that aircraft‘s responsibility to
       maintain safe separation until number 1 acknowledges the breakout, confirms visual
       contact, or establishes altitude separation. If number 1 directs the breakout, number 1 is
       responsible for safe separation and deconfliction until acknowledgement, visual contact,
       or altitude separation.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    173


      9.15.3.4. After number 2 achieves safe separation and visual contact with number 1, a
      radio call is made to advise number 1 (“Texan 2, visual”). Number 1 then directs a rejoin
      as appropriate. Do not rejoin until directed by number 1.
9.16. Lost Sight Procedures:
   9.16.1. Objective. Flight path deconfliction and notification of a lost sight condition.
   9.16.2. Description. When one aircraft loses sight of another (usually number 2 loses sight
   of number 1), the formation achieves at least vertical separation then completes rejoin when
   visual contact is regained.
   9.16.3. Procedures. If visual contact with number 1 is lost, number 2 will notify number 1
   and state current altitude (“Texan 2, blind, one-seven thousand”). If there is no timely
   acknowledgement of the ―blind‖ call, number 2 will maneuver away from the last known
   position of number 1 and alter altitude. In some cases, heading or turn information may also
   be appropriate for this call (“Texan 2, blind, one-seven thousand, right turn through heading
   130”).
      9.16.3.1. If number 1 maneuvers into the sun, number 2 may lose sight. Although visual
      contact is usually regained within moments, a momentarily blind condition could pose a
      great hazard for midair collision. A sun-blind condition is an actual lost-sight case; apply
      proper procedures immediately.
      9.16.3.2. The formation member with visual contact transmits a relative position from
      the ―blind‖ aircraft; for example, “Texan 1, visual, right, 2 o’clock, high.” If number 1 is
      ―blind,‖ but number 2 has number 1 in sight, number 1 has the option to direct a rejoin. In
      this case, number 2 does not rejoin closer than a route position until number 1 calls
      ―visual.‖ If number 2 is ―blind,‖ and number 1 has number 2 in sight, and the situation
      requires immediate aircraft separation, number 1 maneuvers to ensure separation between
      the two aircraft.
      9.16.3.3. If both aircraft have lost sight of each other, number 1 must immediately direct
      a minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation. Until visual contact is regained, number 1
      must take positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction. Both formation members
      maintain this separation until either visual contact is regained and a rejoin is initiated or
      clearance to recover separately is received.
9.17. Lead Changes:
   9.17.1. Objective. In-flight formation position change.
   9.17.2. Description. Number 1 and number 2 exchange formation positions. As previously
   explained, the designated flight lead retains his responsibility and authority throughout the
   mission. That role is not affected by a lead change.
   9.17.3. Procedure. Lead changes can be made with the formation in many flight attitudes.
   If in fingertip, number 1 will direct number 2 to route and call or signal for the lead change.
   Number 2 will assume route position near line abreast (LAB). If the formation is already in
   route or greater spacing, number 1 may use the radio to transfer the lead. Number 2 will
   acknowledge the lead change and become the new number 1 regardless of the method of lead
   transfer (visual signal or radio call). If number 1 uses a visual signal, number 2 will
 174                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   acknowledge with visual signals. If number 1 uses a radio call to initiate the lead change, the
   new number 1 accepts the number 1 position with a radio call.
       9.17.3.1. Lead changes accomplished with visual signals should be expeditious to
       minimize the time without a leader actively clearing for the formation. If limited visibility
       is an issue, use the radio to execute the lead change.
       9.17.3.2. When a lead change is initiated from fingertip, number 2 moves out and
       forward to ensure wingtip separation. Number 2 accepts the lead after reaching a position
       abeam number 1 and immediately assumes responsibility as the new number 1. The old
       number 1 will assume wingman responsibilities. Unless changed by the new number 1,
       the formation will remain in the position from which the lead change was initiated. For
       example, if the lead change was initiated from route, the flight will remain in route. If
       number 1 uses a radio call to initiate the lead change, the new number 1 accepts the
       number 1 position with a radio call. If the old number 1 uses a visual signal, the new
       number 1 accepts the number 1 position with a head nod.
       9.17.3.3. The new number 1 turns on the NACWS or TAS and switches the transponder
       to ALT after assuming the number 1 position. The new number 2 will turn off the
       NACWS or TAS and switch the transponder to STBY following the lead change but must
       prioritize tasks. Wingman consideration dictates that after completing the lead change,
       the new number 1 utilizes a power setting that allows the new number 2 to stabilize in the
       assigned position.
       9.17.3.4. Procedures for a nav lead change during the BD check are the same as a
       standard lead change, with the exception that the number 1 aircraft maintains control of
       the radios, squawk and TAS while inspecting the number 2 aircraft. The aircraft in the
       nav lead position (the aircraft being inspected) must clear for the formation and comply
       with all clearances.
9.18. Speed Brake Exercise:
   9.18.1. Objective. Practice maintaining position as number 2 when the speed brake is
   operated.
   9.18.2. Description. Utilizing the speed brake is an effective method for number 1 to slow
   the formation or achieve a desired descent profile while maintaining a higher power setting,
   which is highly advantageous to number 2. The speed brake exercise is normally practiced
   during the formation recovery.
   9.18.3. Procedure. Number 2 lowers or raises the speed brake, as required, to match
   number 1‘s configuration and remain in the assigned formation position.

Section 9C—Maneuvering Fundamentals

9.19. Introduction. Common terminology and concepts applicable to formation flight are used
throughout the Air Force. The following are fundamental concepts:
   9.19.1. Stabilized. In control and able to complete the maneuver safely within the pilot‘s
   capabilities. In this manual, number 2 is often directed to stabilize before continuing a
   maneuver. For example, number 2 must stabilize in route before continuing to fingertip
   during a rejoin. Stabilize does not mean stop; it means under control.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     175


   9.19.2. Heading Crossing Angle (HCA) (Figure 9 1). The angular difference between the
   longitudinal axes of two aircraft. HCA is also synonymous with the term "angle off."
   9.19.3. Aspect Angle (AA) (Figure 9.1. and Figure 9.2.) Aspect is expressed in degrees
   off the tail of the reference aircraft, commonly expressed in multiples of 10. For example, at
   6 o‘clock to the reference aircraft, the aspect is zero. At 40 degrees left, the aspect is 4L. AA
   is not a clock position and is independent of aircraft heading. Two important AAs used
   extensively in T-6 training are 30 and 45 degrees (Figure 9.3). Note position of the vertical
   stabilizer on the outside wing.
   9.19.4. Closure. Overtake created by airspeed advantage and/or angles; the rate at which
   range decreases. Closure can be positive (decreasing range) or negative (increasing range),
   and is usually measured by the velocity rate (knots) at which the range increases/decreases.

   9.19.10. Lead Pursuit (Figure 9.6.) Number 2 aims the aircraft nose in front of number
   1‘s flight path. With enough lead pursuit, AA and closure will increase, and HCA will
   decrease. Various lead pursuit pictures may result in aft LOS, no LOS, or minimal forward
   LOS depending on the magnitude of lead pursuit and other parameters such as relative
   airspeed and G.

   9.19.11. Pure Pursuit (Figure 9.7.) Number 2 aims the aircraft nose directly at number 1.
   In pure pursuit there is initially no LOS; the other aircraft remains fixed at 12 o‘clock in the
   canopy. A pure pursuit picture initially creates closure that diminishes over time. AA equals
   HCA, which also both diminish over time. If both aircraft are co-airspeed, an attempt to
   sustain pure pursuit eventually evolves into lag pursuit, resulting in increasing range and a
   decreased AA.

   9.19.12. Lag Pursuit (Figure 9.8.) Number 2 aims the aircraft nose behind number 1‘s

   decreases, and HCA increases.

   aircraft‘s lateral axis (parallel to the wings and perpendicular to the fuselage). The numbers 3
   and 9 refer to clock position. Number 2 should normally remain aft of number 1‘s 3/9 line
   during maneuvering. This line equates to a 90-degree AA (9 aspect).

   9.19.14. Turn Circle. As an aircraft maneuvers in a turn, the flight path describes an arc,
   referred to as a turn circle.
   9.19.15. Turn Rate. This is the rate of heading change (nose track), normally measured in
   degrees per second. At about 10,000 feet MSL, at 30-degree bank, 180 KIAS (such as during
   a normal rejoin), the T-6 turn rate is approximately 3 degrees per second.
   9.19.16. Turning Room. This is the volume of airspace (vertical and horizontal) that is
   available to execute maneuvers that change aspect, angle off, and closure. In the T-6, turning
   room is mostly used aft of the 3/9 line.
   9.19.17. Safe Airspace. Generally, this is an area where any immediate threat of collision is
   unlikely if an out-of-plane maneuver is initiated. Pulling toward number 1‘s high 6 o‘clock is
   a common example of safe airspace for number 2.
   9.19.18. Lag Reposition (High Yo-Yo) (Figure 9.10.) A high yo-yo is a reposition of
   number 2‘s aircraft using various pursuit combinations and a move out-of-plane above
   number 1‘s POM to control closure and aspect, in order to prevent a potential 3/9 line
   overshoot. It creates turning room by using the vertical POM (out-of-plane).

   9.19.19. Quarter Plane (Figure 9.11.) A quarter plane is an aggressive, last ditch, out-of-
   plane lag maneuver used to control closure and aspect in order to preserve the 3/9 line. In a
   true quarter plane, number 2 establishes a POM that is 90 degrees to number 1‘s POM. This
   situation may be caused by a late decision (or no decision) to execute a high yo-yo or a
   failure to control closure and aspect. Indicators that a quarter plane is needed are similar to
   those of a high yo-yo. However, aspect, HCA, range, and closure cues are more significant
   and require a much more aggressive maneuver than a lag reposition.

   9.19.20. Lead Reposition (Low Yo-Yo) (Figure 9.12.) A low yo-yo is a reposition of
   number 2‘s aircraft, using various combinations of pursuit and a move out-of-plane below
   number 1‘s POM to increase closure and AA.

Section 9D—Formation Fundamentals

9.20. Introduction. This section describes the basic positions and maneuvers used in a T-6
formation. Positions are defined with regard to the formation position and the formation spacing.
The basic formation positions are fingertip and echelon. The basic spacing options are close and
route.
   9.20.1. Fingertip:
   9.20.2. Objective. Maintain close formation spacing for WX penetration, airfield arrival,
   departure, flyovers, and aerial demonstration formations.
   9.20.3. Description. The fingertip position is flown on an angle approximately 30 degrees
   aft of the 3/9 line (equates to a 6 AA), with approximately 10 feet of wingtip separation. It is
   the closest that number 2 will be to number 1 during formation flying. Therefore, maintaining
   the proper position is critical to flight path deconfliction. See Figure 9.13.
 184                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 9.13. Fingertip Turn-Into and Turn-Away Positions.




   9.20.4. Procedure. In fingertip, the contract is that number 1 will fly a smooth aircraft, and
   number 2 will adjust to maintain proper position. Number 2‘s primary FCP reference to
   maintain proper vertical (up and down) position is to place the exhaust stack on top of
   number 1‘s closest wing. Number 2‘s primary reference to maintain proper longitudinal (fore
   and aft) position is to center number 1‘s aft position light on the front edge of the engine
   exhaust stack opening and align number 1‘s pitot tube with the aft edge of the engine exhaust
   stack opening (which should be visible above the wing). Number 2‘s primary reference to
   maintain proper lateral spacing (distance between number 1 and number 2) is when number
   2‘s FCP pilot is aligned with the forward edge of number 1‘s horizontal stabilizer (Figure
   9.14). This lateral reference maintains approximately 10 feet of wingtip spacing between the
   aircraft.
       9.20.4.1. Good fingertip position is the result of recognizing deviations, anticipating
       required control inputs, and applying deliberate corrections. Make continuous, small, and
       controlled corrections to stay in position. Keeping the aircraft trimmed and coordinated
       decreases workload and generally makes it easier to maintain position. Number 1 should
       maintain a constant power setting or make smooth power changes, so number 2 can make
       small, precise power changes instead of large changes. Power corrections usually require
       three PCL movements: one to start the correction, one to stop the aircraft, and finally one
       to stabilize the aircraft in the proper position.
       9.20.4.2. When a deviation is recognized, initially correct one reference at a time.
       Correct the vertical position or stack first, correct fore and aft second, and finally adjust
       the lateral spacing in or out. Push (forward control stick pressure) or pull (aft control stick
       pressure) to move the aircraft vertically up or down with respect to number 1. Increase
       power to move the aircraft forward and decrease power to move the aircraft back. Finally,
       make small (almost imperceptible) bank angle changes toward or away from number 1 to
       move the aircraft laterally in or out.
       9.20.4.3. Number 1 executes a shallow wing rock to direct number 2 to fingertip from
       route.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  185


Figure 9.14. Fingertip Spacing References.




9.21. Route Formation:
   9.21.1. Objective. Increase flight maneuverability while enhancing clearing and visual
   lookout.
   9.21.2. Description. Route (Figure 9.15) is a wider extension of close formation spacing
   and is flown to enhance clearing and visual lookout, increase flight maneuverability, and ease
   the completion of in-flight checks, radio changes, other cockpit tasks, or simply to allow
   number 2 to relax. Number 1 sends number 2 to route with a radio call or visual signal. With
   the formation in route, number 1 should restrict maneuvering to moderate turns and pitch
   changes. Maximum bank angle in route is approximately 60 degrees.
   9.21.3. Route Spacing. Route spacing is from two-ship widths to no further than
   approximately 500 feet. Route is flown no further forward than LAB and no further aft than
   the extended 30 degree fingertip line. When not in a turn, number 2 generally maintains a
 186                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   position level with number 1 (a level stack) by keeping the helmet of number 1‘s FCP pilot
   on the horizon. Although the formal definition of the route position has fairly wide
   tolerances, number 2 should strive to maintain a specific position when in route.
   9.21.4. Route LAB. When LAB, strive to remain between the extended 3/9 line and
   approximately 10 degrees aft of LAB. Typically, route is flown LAB and out toward the 500-
   foot limit when WX conditions are not a factor, and when visual clearing, flight path
   deconfliction and maneuvering are formation priorities. LAB at 2 to 4 ship widths is typically
   flown when anticipating a turn away while in route (echelon turn).

Figure 9.15. Route.




   9.21.5. Turns In Route. When inside a turn, number 2 maneuvers below number 1‘s POM
   only as necessary to keep number 1 in sight just above the canopy rail. On the outside of a
   turn, number 2 maintains the same vertical references used in echelon turns. As in fingertip,
   number 2 will not cross to the opposite side unless specifically directed to do so verbally or
   by a crossunder signal from number 1.
   9.21.6. Procedure. Number 2 stabilizes in route before diverting attention to change radio
   channels, accomplish in-flight checks, or execute other cockpit tasks.
9.22. Crossunder (Figure 9.16.):
   9.22.1. Objective. A crossunder is used to reposition number 2 from one side of the
   formation to the other.
   9.22.2. Description. A crossunder may be accomplished with the formation in fingertip or
   route formation. Number 2 maintains nose-tail separation while crossing under. Number 1
   directs a crossunder with a radio call or visual signal. The visual signal is a rapid, shallow
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                187


   wing dip in the desired direction of the crossunder. The size of the wing dip should be
   proportional to number 2‘s spacing. Anticipate each power change and make small changes
   in pitch and bank.

Figure 9.16. Crossunder.




   9.22.3. Procedure. To accomplish a crossunder, reduce power as required to establish a
   small forward LOS rate. Move back and down below number 1‘s POM to establish nose-tail
   clearance, and then add power slightly to stop rearward movement. If in a climb, keep the
   power reduction small to avoid excessive rearward movement. Bank slightly toward the new
   side to change aircraft heading a few degrees (create small HCA). Roll wings level and fly
   across and behind number 1. Add power as required to maintain proper nose-tail separation.
   Typically, a slight power increase is required. Number 2‘s canopy bow should appear to be
   superimposed on the trailing edge of number 1‘s elevator. Reestablish number 1‘s heading
   when in the desired position on the new side. Add power to move forward and up into
   position. Reduce power to stabilize in position on the opposite side of number 1 from which
   the crossunder was started.
9.23. Echelon Turn (Figure 9.17.):
   9.23.1. Objective. Turn the formation while in close or route formation using other than
   fingertip references.
   9.23.2. Description. A turn in which number 2 remains in the same POM as number 1.
   Echelon turns may be accomplished from fingertip or route. All turns while in route position
   will be echelon turns (echelon signal not required). When in fingertip, however, turns are
   only flown as echelon turns if indicated by number 1.
 188                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 9.17. Echelon Turn.




   9.23.3. Procedure. Instead of maintaining fingertip references, number 2 remains in the
   same POM as number 1. Number 1 should roll smoothly into bank (approximately 60
   degrees) and maintain appropriate back pressure. Slight variations in bank angle to control
   undesired climbs and descents are smoother and easier for number 2 than variations in back
   pressure. Number 1‘s roll rate should approximate that used during instrument conditions.
   Number 2 matches number 1‘s roll rate and uses back pressure to maintain spacing. In a level
   turn, the horizon bisects number 1‘s fuselage. In the FCP, approximately one-half of the
   yellow rescue door should be visible (resembles a triangle) behind the aft edge of number 1‘s
   wing and one wingspan spacing will exist between the aircraft. If out of position, use bank to
   correct vertical (to keep number 1‘s fuselage bisected by the horizon), power to correct fore
   and aft position, and back pressure to maintain spacing. During rollout, number 1 should use
   a smooth roll rate and gradually reduce back pressure. Number 2 matches number 1‘s roll
   rate to maintain position. Upon rolling back to wings level, number 2 should be reestablished
   in the fingertip position.
9.24. Reforms:
   9.24.1. Objective. Move Number 2 from one formation position to a closer one.
   9.24.2. Description. Reforms are commonly used to when number 1 desires to bring
   number 2 in from close trail, fighting wing, or route. Reforms may be to route or fingertip.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   189


   9.24.3. Procedure. Number 1 directs a reform with a radio call or visual signal (wing rock).
   The size of the wing rock is based on distance between aircraft and may use slight climbs or
   descents when necessary for energy management or area orientation. The procedure for
   accomplishing a reform varies based on number 2‘s position and distance relative to number
   1. To reform from route to fingertip, maneuver as necessary to stabilize at a 2-ship width
   route position on the fingertip line, and then slowly move up the line to fingertip. See
   paragraph 9.27.3.2 for guidance on reforms from fighting wing, and paragraph 9.32.5 for
   guidance on reforms from close trail.
9.25. Rejoins:
   9.25.1. Objective. Get the flight back together safely and efficiently.
   9.25.2. Description. Rejoins are commonly practiced from pitchouts and after number 2 has
   taken spacing. They are also accomplished after breakouts, practice lost wingman, instrument
   trail departures, and lost-sight situations (anytime the formation is split).
   9.25.3. Procedure. Number 1 initiates rejoin with radio call or visual signal and may use
   slight climbs or descents during a rejoin when necessary for energy management or area
   orientation. Number 1 should consider using a radio call to initiate a rejoin when number 2 is
   not in sight. All rejoins are to fingertip unless directed otherwise by number 1. Unless
   otherwise briefed, rejoin airspeed in the T-6 is 180 KIAS. Number 1 calls out current
   airspeed if it differs more than 10 knots from briefed or expected rejoin airspeed. The size of
   the wing rock is based on distance between aircraft. Number 1 should monitor number 2
   closely during all rejoins. If number 1 perceives an unsafe situation developing at anytime
   during the rejoin, take positive action immediately to prevent a midair collision.
      9.25.3.1. Straight-ahead Rejoin. Use straight-ahead rejoins when a turn is not possible
      or practical. Airspeed closure is used to effect a straight-ahead rejoin. Number 1 should
      maintain a stable platform (level, climbing or descending), clear and monitor number 2
      during the rejoin.
          9.25.3.1.1. Number 1. Direct the rejoin. If a turn is required after a straight-ahead
          rejoin is initiated, inform number 2 and clear. Do not turn into number 2 if it would
          exceed number 2‘s capabilities or prevent a safe rejoin. Due to the location of number
          2 behind and below number 1, number 2 will be difficult to see until the final stages
          of a straight-ahead rejoin.
          9.25.3.1.2. Number 2. Rejoin to the left side unless directed otherwise. Increase
          airspeed to generate closure (initially use 20 to 30 knots of overtake). Establish a
          position behind and slightly below number 1 with a vector toward number 1‘s low 6
          o‘clock position. Placing number 1 slightly above the horizon will help maintain
          separation from number 1‘s wake turbulence. Continue to close until approximately
          500 feet (when details on number 1‘s aircraft, such as the pitot tubes, can be seen). At
          this point, bank slightly away from number 1 (make a bid), toward a position two to
          four ship widths out from number 1‘s wingtip. The velocity vector should angle away
          from number 1. Decrease overtake with a power reduction, and plan to arrive in the
          route position with the same airspeed as number 1. As a technique, reduce the power
          such that the PCL moves aft to match number 1‘s aft LOS in the windscreen. After
190                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


         stabilized in route, move into fingertip. If number 1 turns during a straight-ahead
         rejoin, transition to a turning rejoin, and be alert for possible overshoot situations.
      9.25.3.2. Turning Rejoin. Use a combination of airspeed and angular closure to effect a
      turning rejoin.
         9.25.3.2.1. Number 1. Direct the rejoin. If using a wing rock, attempt to make the
         first wing dip in the direction of the rejoin. Maintain 30 degrees of bank unless
         otherwise briefed. After a pitchout, delay long enough for number 2 to roll out in trail.
         Establish a turn, maintain bank angle, and rejoin airspeed in level flight. Bank and
         pitch may be varied if required for area orientation. A slight climb or descent is
         acceptable for energy management. Monitor number 2‘s AA and closure. Be ready to
         take evasive action if required.
         9.25.3.2.2. Number 2. Base closure and desired aspect on energy and aircraft
         position relative to number 1. When number 1 starts to turn, begin a turn in the same
         direction to intercept the desired aspect. Simultaneously establish desired vertical
         separation (place number 1 within approximately two to four ship widths of the
         horizon) and closure. Manage aspect with minor adjustments to bank angle. Number
         1 must be visible to pilots in both cockpits.
             9.25.3.2.2.1. Begin with approximately 20 to 30 knots of closure and a moderate
             lead pursuit picture (pull nose in front of number 1) to increase aspect. As number
             2 moves inside of number 1‘s turn circle, the vertical stabilizer appears to move
             toward number 1‘s outside wingtip as AA increases. When the vertical stabilizer
             approximately bisects the outside wing (3 aspect/30 degrees AA), reduce bank
             angle to maintain this relative reference line. When stable, there is no LOS.
             9.25.3.2.2.2. If the vertical stabilizer appears to move toward the wingtip, AA is
             increasing. If the vertical stabilizer appears to move toward the wing root, the AA
             is decreasing. Use varying degrees of bank angle to manage aspect during a
             rejoin. Shallow the bank angle to decrease aspect and increase the bank angle to
             increase aspect. As range decreases inside route toward close spacing, the vertical
             stabilizer will appear to move toward the outside wingtip.
             9.25.3.2.2.3. Number 1 should appear slightly above the horizon. Maintain
             number 1 within approximately two to four relative ship widths above the
             horizon. The star on the left wing (or the SA in USAF on the right wing) should
             be directly over the star on the aft fuselage. This is referred to as the ―saddle‖
             between where the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer meets number 1‘s
             fuselage and the aft portion of number 1‘s canopy.
             9.25.3.2.2.4. The critical stage of the rejoin begins approximately 500 feet from
             number 1. Inside 300 to 500 feet, the normal fingertip references will become
             visible. Descend slightly and move forward (increase aspect with lead pursuit)
             onto an extension of the fingertip reference line. Begin decreasing closure with a
             power reduction and speed brake as necessary. Monitor bank and overtake closely
             during the last few hundred feet to ensure aspect and closure are under control.
             Plan to stabilize in route with slight positive closure but approximately co-
             airspeed with number 1, and then move into fingertip at a controlled rate.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  191


              9.25.3.2.2.5. During two-ship formation ops, unless prebriefed or directed
              otherwise, number 2 normally rejoins to the inside of the turn. To rejoin to the
              outside of the turn (number 3 position), the event will either be prebriefed or
              directed. Number 2 may request to rejoin to number 3, and number 1 may consent
              on the radio. Rejoins to the outside of the turn (number 3 position) are initially
              flown exactly like rejoins to the inside of the turn. In the later portion of the
              rejoin, number 2 will cross below and behind number 1 with at least nose-tail
              separation to get outside of number 1‘s turn circle. Maintain enough positive
              closure (about 10 to 15 knots) to facilitate this move to the outside. Stabilize in
              route echelon on the outside and then move into fingertip at a controlled rate.
9.26. Overshoots:
   9.26.1. Objective. Safely dissipate excessive closure and/or aspect.
   9.26.2. Description. A properly flown overshoot will safely dissipate excessive closure and
   (or) aspect during a rejoin. Number 2 must not delay an overshoot with an unusually
   aggressive attempt to save a rejoin.
   9.26.3. Procedure. Keep number 1 in sight at all times during any overshoot. Reduce power
   and use speed brake (if required) as soon as excess overtake is recognized.
      9.26.3.1. Straight-ahead Rejoin Overshoot. A straight-ahead rejoin with excessive
      closure results in a pure airspeed overshoot. Maintain lateral spacing on a parallel or
      divergent vector to number 1. Do not turn into number 1, which is a common error while
      looking over the shoulder at number 1‘s aircraft. This can cause a vector into number 1‘s
      flight path and create a dangerous situation requiring a breakout. A small, controllable
      3/9 line overshoot is easily managed and can still allow an effective rejoin. There is no
      need to breakout if flight paths are not convergent and visual contact can be maintained.
      After beginning to slide back into formation, retract the speed brake and increase power
      prior to achieving co-airspeed (no LOS) to prevent excessive aft movement.
      9.26.3.2. Turning Rejoin Overshoot. A turning rejoin with excessive closure airspeed
      results in a combination airspeed-aspect overshoot in a POM about 50 feet below number
      1. Attempt to overshoot early enough to cross number 1‘s 6 o‘clock with a minimum
      spacing of two ship lengths. Breakout if unable to maintain nose-tail separation. Once
      outside the turn, use bank and back stick pressure as necessary to stabilize in route
      echelon position. Fly no higher than route echelon. Excessive back pressure causes
      closure. A co-airspeed overshoot due to excess aspect may not require maneuvering
      outside of number 1‘s turn circle. Instead, there may be sufficient space in number 1‘s
      low 6 o‘clock to align fuselages and stop the overshoot. When under control, return to the
      inside of number 1‘s turn, reestablish an appropriate rejoin line, and complete the rejoin.

9.27. Fighting Wing:
   9.27.1. Objective. Enhance formation flexibility or maximize clearing.
   9.27.2. Description. Fighting wing is a fluid position defined by a 30 to 45-degree cone,
   500 to 1,000 feet aft of number 1 (Figure 9.20).

Figure 9.19. Fighting Wing Cone.




   9.27.3. Procedure. Number 1 directs the wingman to fighting wing with a radio call
   (“Texan 2, go fighting wing”). Number 2 acknowledges ―2‖ and maneuvers into the cone.
   Do not call ―in‖ unless performing the ET exercise.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  193


       9.27.3.1. Number 2 maneuvers into and maintains the cone with a combination of pursuit
       selection and lift vector placement. An initial turn away from number 1 (lag pursuit)
       increases lateral spacing and causes a slight movement aft of number 1 (forward LOS).
       The rate of aft movement can be increased with use of power, speed brake, or a vertical
       move out-of-plane. It requires constant analysis of AA and closure to apply the proper
       amounts of lead and lag pursuit and stay within the cone. Number 2 should not stagnate
       in number 1‘s high or low 6-o‘clock while maneuvering within the cone because it is
       difficult for number 1 to monitor number 2 in this position. While flying in the fighting
       wing position, be aware it may be possible for number 2 to be outside standard formation
       parameters (e.g., plus or minus 100 feet vertical of number 1).
       9.27.3.2. To reform from fighting wing, number 1 signals a reform or directs Number 2
       to another formation position (except close trail). If number 1 wants number 2 to reform
       to a particular side, the reform is directed with a radio call or wing rock (“Texan 2,
       reform right side”). Lacking direction from number 1, number 2 reforms to the side
       currently occupied.
   9.27.4. Visually, the aft (30 AA) line of the cone is the same as for the basic rejoin: number
   1‘s vertical stabilizer bisects the opposite wing. The forward (45 AA) line of the cone is
   approximately when number 1‘s vertical stabilizer is superimposed over the opposite wingtip
   or the inside wingtip strobe light just forward of the spinner.

Section 9E—Mission Execution

9.28. Introduction. This section describes formation mission execution and advanced
formation maneuvering. The basics of departure, en route, area, and recovery procedures are the
same as for single-ship missions; however, accommodations must be made for the additional
aircraft in a formation.
9.29. Ground Ops:
   9.29.1. Engine Start. Formations normally start engines on a visual signal, either pilot-to-
   pilot or relayed through the crew chiefs. If aircraft are parked beyond visual range, the FL
   sets a start time. If starting without visual contact between pilots or crew chiefs, number 1
   will normally check number 2 in on the radio at start time. If required, number 2 will inform
   number 1 of any difficulties that may delay start or taxi at this time.
   9.29.2. Before Taxi:
       9.29.2.1. All flight members will check the ATIS before check-in. When ready to taxi,
       number 2 gives a thumbs-up signal to number 1. If not in visual contact, number 2 awaits
       check-in.
       9.29.2.2. Number 1 normally checks the flight in on VHF, then UHF. If more time is
       needed by one of the crews, advise the other crew during the post-start check-in.
       (Example: “Texan 2 needs (x) minutes,” followed by number 1's response, “1.”) After
       check-in with all members ready, number 1 calls for taxi clearance. Number 2 responds
       with “2,” after number 1‘s clearance acknowledgement indicating that the clearance is
       understood. If number 2 does not understand the clearance, ask for clarification.
 194                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   9.29.3. Taxi. The formation normally taxis together as a two-ship. If another aircraft
   attempts to taxi between members of the formation, Number 1 asks that aircraft to hold.
   Formations may taxi staggered when taxiway width and local procedures allow. Number 1
   should stagger on the downwind side.
   9.29.4. Before Takeoff. The overspeed governor and before-takeoff checks are completed
   automatically at the EOR at the normal locations for single-ship missions. When complete,
   number 2 gives a thumbs-up signal to number 1. On other than instrument trail departures,
   number 2 turns off the NACWS or places the TAS to STBY and selects STBY on the
   transponder prior to takeoff.
9.30. Formation Departures (Figure 9.20.) Environmental or training factors determine
takeoff method. Number 1 will ensure all members of the formation understand the takeoff
option being executed. See AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3, for formation takeoff restrictions.

Figure 9.20. Formation Takeoff.




9.30.1. Objective. Safely get the formation airborne.
   9.30.2. Description. There are three options for getting a T-6 formation airborne. Option 1,
   formation takeoff, commonly referred to as a ―wing takeoff,‖ is the most common; option 2,
   interval takeoff, is generally driven by wind requirements; and option 3, instrument trail
   departure, is used when WX (ceiling and visibility) does not allow an interval or formation
   takeoff. See AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3 for formation takeoff restrictions.
   9.30.3. Procedure. Details regarding the three T-6 formation departure options follow:
       9.30.3.1. Wing Takeoff:
           9.30.3.1.1. Place number 2 on the upwind side for takeoff when the crosswind
           component exceeds 5 knots. This will keep number 2 from entering number 1‘s wake
           turbulence in the event number 2 falls behind.
           9.30.3.1.2. Number 1 takes the center of one-half of the RWY and taxis a sufficient
           distance down to allow number 2 room to maneuver into position.
           9.30.3.1.3. Number 2 lines up on the fingertip line with a minimum of 20 feet of
           lateral wingtip clearance. Number 2 gives a head nod to signify ready for run-up.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                195


        Number 1 gives the run-up signal and looks at number 2. Number 2 acknowledges the
        signal with a head nod.
        9.30.3.1.4. Both aircraft smoothly increase the PCL to approximately 30 percent
        torque and check the engine. Do not fixate inside the cockpit. Ensure the aircraft does
        not creep forward.
        9.30.3.1.5. Number 1 looks at number 2. When ready for takeoff, number 2 gives a
        head nod.
        9.30.3.1.6. Number 1 signals for brake release with a downward head nod. Both
        aircraft then smoothly add power, with number 1 targeting 85 to 95 percent torque to
        give number 2 a slight power advantage.
        9.30.3.1.7. Number 2 uses power as required to maintain position on the takeoff roll.
        Number 2 uses peripheral vision to detect lateral movement on the RWY and matches
        number 1‘s pitch attitude. Stack level (helmet on the horizon) until the gear and flaps
        are raised. If unable to maintain fore or aft position with normal power settings,
        number 2 selects MAX power and performs an individual takeoff. Number 1 directs a
        rejoin when conditions permit.
        9.30.3.1.8. When the formation is safely airborne with a minimum of 110 KIAS,
        number 1 retracts both gear and flaps. Number 2 raises gear and flaps when climbing,
        and number 1‘s gear begins to retract. If overrunning number 1, number 2 may delay
        retracting the gear. Number 2 never raises the gear before number 1. Number 2
        performs the after takeoff check and assumes fingertip.
        9.30.3.1.9. The first turn out of traffic is not initiated until a safe airspeed and
        altitude.
     9.30.3.2. Interval Takeoff:
        9.30.3.2.1. Same as wing takeoff through engine run-up.
        9.30.3.2.2. There is no visual signal for interval takeoff. After number 2 gives a head
        nod that the run-up check is complete, number 1 releases brakes and performs a MAX
        power takeoff. Number 2 waits 6 seconds and begins the takeoff roll in MAX power.
        9.30.3.2.3. When airborne at a minimum of 160 KIAS, number 1 reduces power to
        85 to 95 percent (or as required for an intermediate level-off) and maintains airspeed
        of 160 KIAS. The FL will establish intermediate level-off airspeeds in the preflight
        briefing.
        9.30.3.2.4. The rejoin may be a turning rejoin, a straight-ahead rejoin or, in some
        cases, a combination of both. Number 2 must be alert for transitions from one type of
        rejoin to another as number 1 follows the departure route.
     9.30.3.3. Instrument Trail Departure:
        9.30.3.3.1. Same as wing takeoff through engine run-up.
        9.30.3.3.2. During trail departures in IMC, sound instrument flying is the first
        priority and must not be sacrificed to perform secondary tasks.
 196                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


          9.30.3.3.3. All formation members must strictly adhere to the briefed climb speeds,
          power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points.
          9.30.3.3.4. If task saturated or disoriented, number 2 ceases attempts to maintain
          trail, immediately concentrates on flying the instrument departure, and notifies
          number 1.
          9.30.3.3.5. Takeoff spacing is no less than 20 seconds.
          9.30.3.3.6. Each aircraft climbs at MAX power at 160 KIAS and uses 30 degrees
          bank for all turns.
          9.30.3.3.7. Until join-up or level-off, both number 1 and number 2 call when passing
          even-numbered thousands of feet (2,000, 4,000, etc.) and when initiating heading
          changes. Acknowledgments are not required, but both aircraft should monitor radio
          transmissions and the progress of the other member of the formation. Immediately
          correct any deviations from the departure route.
          9.30.3.3.8. During the climb and through level-off, each aircraft maintains positional
          awareness using NAVAIDs and all available aircraft systems, including the clock,
          NACWS/ TAS, and GPS.
          9.30.3.3.9. Number 2 will maintain a minimum of 1,000 feet of altitude separation
          from number 1 until visual. If number 2 cannot maintain 1,000-foot separation and
          comply with the minimum safe altitude, number 1 may reduce the vertical separation
          to 500 feet.
          9.30.3.3.10. If a visual join up cannot be accomplished by level-off, number 1
          requests 1,000 feet of altitude separation between the aircraft in the formation until
          number 2 is visual.
          9.30.3.3.11. Number 2 rejoins only after visually acquiring number 1 and receiving
          permission. After the rejoin, number 2 turns off the NACWS/ TAS and transponder to
          STBY.
9.31. Wing Work Exercise (WW Ex):
   9.31.1. Objectives:
       9.31.1.1. Number 1. Develop judgment and skill necessary to lead a formation through
       varying flight regimes. Use a combination of smooth changes in pitch, bank, and wing
       loading (Gs) to provide a stable platform with consistent, predictable roll rates, and no
       sudden changes in back pressure. Clear visually while planning for the formation
       (navigation, next maneuver, etc.) and monitor number 2. Clear, plan, and monitor.
       9.31.1.2. Number 2. Maintain or constantly correct back to fingertip. Make proper
       power and flight control inputs using small, smooth, deliberate inputs. Trim should be
       used to allow ease in maintaining position. Avoid tendency to focus or stare at any single
       reference. Practice visually scanning all of number 1‘s aircraft for position references and
       visually clear through number 1.
   9.31.2. Description. The WW Ex is typically flown as series maneuvers in a targeted
   airspeed range. Eventually maneuver up to 2 to 3 Gs and approximately 90 degrees AOB as
   proficiency improves. Initially, proficiency may limit both number 1 and number 2 to lower
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       197


     levels of the WW Ex. Practice at the lower levels of the WW Ex gives number 2 a reduced
     pitch, bank, and G environment to learn to recognize deviations and develop the ability to
     correct. This allows number 2 to build the skills necessary to effectively and efficiently
     correct and maintain fingertip. See Table 9.2.

Table 9.1. T-6 WW Ex Training Levels and Parameters.

                                      degrees                                minimum

                                      degrees                                minimum
 3          III       ~ 0º to 90º     ~ +/- 35         ~ 1 to 3 G            120 KIAS
                                      degrees                                minimum

     9.31.3. Procedure. Levels provide a measure of difficulty of the exercise. They provide a
     building-block approach to develop fingertip flying skills and proficiency. Levels also
     provide a way to set training objectives.
     9.31.4. Number 1:
        9.31.4.1. Power Control or Energy. Target energy level is the middle of the area
        altitude block between approximately 180 to 200 KIAS. Normally, number 1 sets power
        to maintain desired energy level. As a guide, use approximately 50 to 55 percent torque
        in a low area (~8,000 to 10,000 feet MSL) and approximately 55 to 60 percent torque in a
        high area (~16,000 to 18,000 feet MSL). WX or other environmental conditions may
        affect the actual energy level in the area. Avoid extremely low or high power settings
        during the WW Ex as it limits the ability of number 2 to adjust for deviations.
        9.31.4.2. Maneuvering. During initial training, use smaller bank angles and
        conservative climbs and/or descents (Level I WW Ex) to stay within number 2‘s
        capabilities. As number 2‘s proficiency allows, increase to Level II or Level III. Avoid
        advancing to higher levels too quickly; develop and master proficiency at lower levels
        first. For Levels II and III, initially blend pitch with roll to the desired bank angle. Hold
        the bank angle as the nose of the aircraft drops through the horizon. As the nose
        approaches the desired nose-low pitch attitude, begin the rollout and reverse direction
        while maintaining positive G. Attempt to pull through the horizon in a near wings-level
        attitude. Use bank angle to aid pitch control.
            9.31.4.2.1. Do not stair-step or ratchet roll rates into or out of turns. Initiate changes
            in bank smoothly then continue using moderate, positive movements. Remain
            predictable. Do not begin a rollout and suddenly roll back into the bank. If a turn must
            be continued for area orientation, stop the roll, pause momentarily to allow number 2
            to adjust, then begin the roll smoothly back into the turn.
 198                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


          9.31.4.2.2. Visually clear the flight path before commencing the turn. The WW Ex
          may be started with either a blend of pull and roll into a climb or descent, depending
          on energy level. If starting from a low kinetic or high potential energy level, smoothly
          increase bank angle, and allow the nose of the aircraft to slice to the desired nose-low
          attitude, and then begin the WW Ex with a vertical pull-up as stated above.
          9.31.4.2.3. Consider environmental conditions, such as sun angle and cloud layers,
          and plan formation maneuvering to avoid them as able.
          9.31.4.2.4. Do not stare at number 2, but continually monitor number 2‘s position
          and status. Use the mirrors if necessary, and communicate with the other
          crewmember when required to assist monitoring number 2. Be ready to take evasive
          action and/or direct a breakout, if required.
   9.31.5. Number 2:
       9.31.5.1. Power Control or Energy. The ability to fly well in close formation is the
       result of recognizing, anticipating, and applying small corrections. Make continuous,
       small, and controlled corrections to stay in position. Always keep the aircraft trimmed
       and coordinated. Make small, precise power changes instead of using large power bursts.
       9.31.5.2. Maneuvering. To remain in proper position, changes in bank (roll), backstick
       pressure (pull), and power must be blended as necessary into one simultaneous action.
          9.31.5.2.1. Turns Away. When number 1 turns away, number 2‘s aircraft is outside
          number 1‘s turn circle. If corrections are not made, AA decreases (number 2‘s aircraft
          moves aft of the fingertip line) and range increases (lateral spacing increases).
          Number 2 must match number 1‘s roll rate, increase back pressure and climb to
          maintain vertical position. This requires an increase in power to maintain airspeed
          and position. When number 1 stops the roll-in, number 2 must reduce power as the
          relative climb is complete.
          9.31.5.2.2. Turns Into. Add slight forward pressure to maintain vertical position
          and reduce power. Be aware of collision potential at all times. The collision potential
          increases in turbulence or while flying maximum performance maneuvers or
          maneuvers that are not frequently flown.
9.32. Close Trail Exercise (Figure 9.22.):
   9.32.1. Objective. Practice maneuvering with number 2 in a position below and behind
   number 1. Number 1 will maneuver similarly to the WW Ex.
   9.32.2. Description. Close trail spacing is one to two aircraft lengths (nose to tail) behind
   number 1, just below number 1‘s wake turbulence and prop wash. To prevent encountering
   wake turbulence, avoid flying high in the close trail position. Number 1 may direct close trail
   from fingertip, route, or echelon.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     199


Figure 9.21. Close Trail.




   9.32.3. Procedure—Number 1. Close trail maneuvering limitations are the same as the
   WW Ex. Direct number 2 to the close trail position with a radio call (“Texan 2, go close
   trail). Wait for number 2 to call ―in‖ before maneuvering. Maneuver in a smooth, predictable
   manner similar to the WW Ex using combinations of turns and lazy eight-type maneuvers.
   Maintain positive G at all times. Avoid sudden releases of back stick pressure, rapid or
   inconsistent turn rates, and rapid turn reversals. Power and maneuvering requirements are
   identical to fingertip formation.
   9.32.4. Procedure—Number 2. Acknowledge number 1‘s directive with a radio call, “2.”
   Maneuver into the close trail position. Once established in the close trail position, advise
   number 1 with a radio call (“Texan 2, in”).
       9.32.4.1. Maintain position primarily with power. As number 1 maneuvers, anticipate
       power changes. Additionally, during turns at higher G, a small amount of lead or lag
       pursuit may be necessary to maintain position.
       9.32.4.2. Use the relationship between the tips of number 1‘s horizontal tail and the
       underside of number 1‘s wing to estimate nose-tail separation. At approximately two ship
       lengths, the tips of number 1‘s elevator line up about one-third of the way out the wings
       (just past the dihedral break in the wing). As a vertical reference, the engine exhaust
       stacks should be visible directly on top of the wing. Any space between the engine
       exhaust stacks and the wing is too high, and the possibility of encountering wake
       turbulence increases. Other references include making a ―T‖ out of the aft edge of the
       speed brake and the UHF/VHF antenna, or placing number 1‘s wingtips between the
       AOA indexer and magnetic compass.
       9.32.4.3. Closure rates are difficult to recognize and correct when directly behind and
       below number 1. If excessive spacing develops, do not attempt to correct forward with
       power alone. Add power and establish a small amount of lead pursuit if in a turn. If in a
       wings-level attitude, move off to one side to obtain a better visual perspective of number
       1‘s aircraft. The two most important points to remember are to remain below number 1‘s
       wake turbulence and always keep number 1 in sight.
   9.32.5. Reform from Close Trail. Number 1 may direct number 2 to fingertip with a
   shallow wing rock (visual) or radio call. Unless directed otherwise, number 2 goes to
   fingertip on the left side if number 1 is in a wings-level attitude or to fingertip on the inside
 200                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   of the turn. Number 1 may also direct number 2 to route or fighting wing with a radio call.
   Number 1 maneuvers in a smooth, predictable manner and avoids significant power changes
   until number 2 is in the directed formation position.
9.33. Pitchout:
   9.33.1. Objective. Provide spacing for rejoin practice.
   9.33.2. Description. Normally a level turn, approximately 180 degrees, performed
   sequentially, to provide spacing between the aircraft.
   9.33.3. Procedure:
       9.33.3.1. Number 1. Direct a pitchout with a visual signal or radio call. Clear in the
       direction of the desired turn and begin a turn away from number 2, using approximately
       60 degrees of bank and sufficient G to establish the desired airspeed. Slight climbs or
       descents are acceptable for energy management. The degrees of turn may be adjusted for
       WX, area orientation, and energy management. Do not sacrifice clearing to maintain
       precise altitude control or an exact 180-degree turn. Allow enough time for number 2 to
       complete the pitchout and then direct the rejoin with a radio call or visual signal.
       9.33.3.2. Number 2. Stay visual. Delay 2 to 3 seconds or as briefed, which should
       provide approximately 500 to 1,000 feet of separation at rollout, then turn to follow
       number 1. Delaying 5 to 7 seconds will result in approximately 1,500 to 2,000 foot
       spacing. After approximately 90 degrees of turn, vary bank and back stick pressure to
       attain desired spacing and roll out behind and slightly below number 1. Place number 1
       approximately one to two ship widths above the horizon. Rejoin when directed.
9.34. Take Spacing. ―Take spacing‖ is used to put number 2 in a trail position when a pitchout
is not practical. Number 1 directs number 2 to take spacing with a visual signal or radio call
(“Texan 2, take spacing”). Spacing can be achieved with a combination of maneuvering and
deceleration by number 2 and/or acceleration by number 1. Do not exceed the limits of standard
formation (100 feet vertical and 6,000 feet horizontal) if outside the MOA. One technique is for
number 1 to accelerate and direct number 2 to take spacing. Number 2 reduces power and/or uses
speed brake to slow and increase spacing. Another technique is for number 2 to take spacing by
performing a series of ―S‖ turns behind and below number 1‘s prop wash.

Section 9F—T-6 Extended Trail and Preparatory Exercise Procedures

9.35. General. This section introduces formation exercises and procedures to enhance
formation training and ET maneuvering. It applies the building-block approach to ET training
based on fundamental formation concepts discussed in section 9C, Maneuvering Fundamentals,
of this manual.
9.36. Range Estimation. Table 9.4 gives suitable range estimation cues. Some of the cockpit
tools used to compare aircraft size includes the AOA indexer and the STBY magnetic compass.
Externally, the anti-collision strobe light flash guard on the leading edge of the wingtip also
provides a good fixed reference to estimate range.

9.37. Butterfly Setup to LAB (Figure 9.24.):
     9.37.1. Objective. Establish LAB position.
     9.37.2. Description. One or both aircraft maneuver to ―spread‖ the formation to facilitate
     the deconfliction exercise.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  203


Figure 9.22. Butterfly Setup to LAB.




   9.37.3. Procedure. Begin the setup from fingertip or route formation on a reference heading
   at approximately 180 KIAS. Number 1 transmits, “Texan, standby deconfliction exercise,
   reference heading xxx”. Number 2 responds with, “2”. When ready to begin, number 1
   transmits, “Texan, turn away”, to which number 2 responds with “2”. Both aircraft then
   simultaneously initiate a 30-degree bank turn away from each other. After completing 30
   degrees of turn, number 1 immediately reverses the turn with 30 degrees of bank back to the
   reference heading and advises number 2 (Texan, reference heading xxx). Number 2 then
   reverses the turn back to the reference heading in the same manner as number 1, while
   responding with “2”. After arriving back at the reference heading, number 2 should be LAB
   with approximately 3,000 foot spacing. Precise parameters are important in order to achieve
   a timely setup at the desired range and in a good LAB position prior to executing the desired
   exercise. Note: If number 2 rolls out with an undesirable aspect, number 1 may use a check
   turn to expeditiously align the formation for the exercise. Initiate a check turn with a radio
   call announcing the degrees to turn (“Texan, check 20 left”). To accomplish the check turn,
   both aircraft turn simultaneously, quickly rolling into the turn for the specified number of
   degrees and then quickly roll out on the new heading.
9.38. Deconfliction Exercise (Figure 9.23.):
 204                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   9.38.1. Objective. Demonstrate range, closure, AA, LOS, HCA out-of-plane maneuvering,
   lift vector placement, safe airspace, and deconfliction responsibilities.
   9.38.2. Description. This exercise demonstrates what a collision course vector looks like
   with respect to range, aspect, and LOS and how to effectively mitigate and handle such a
   situation in a controlled setup. Deconfliction responsibilities generally refer to number 2‘s
   responsibility not to hit the number 1 aircraft. Each pilot in a formation has a responsibility to
   take whatever action may be necessary to avoid a collision. Number 2‘s primary
   responsibility is not to hit number 1. Number 2 has the responsibility to maneuver and avoid
   collision.

Figure 9.23. Deconfliction Exercise.




   9.38.3. Procedure:
       9.38.3.1. Altitude. As required, 100 feet.
       9.38.3.2. Airspeed. 180 5 KIAS.
       9.38.3.3. Heading. Reference heading 5 degrees prior to commencing exercise.
       9.38.3.4. Power. Approximately 50 percent torque (as required to maintain 180               5
       KIAS).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  205


      9.38.3.5. Maneuver. Vertical out-of-plane reposition maneuver.
      9.38.3.6. Start from LAB. The exercise must be started from LAB and with no less
      than approximately 2,000 feet of lateral separation. If the exercise begins with less than
      desired range, the result will be a quick and dynamic exercise with minimal time to
      discuss the changing parameters. If the exercise begins with excessive lateral spacing, the
      result will be an undesirably high aspect at the end of the exercise creating a potentially
      dangerous situation with excessive closing velocity. The desired starting parameters are
      achieved from the butterfly setup or from a LAB, 2,000 foot lateral spacing tactical setup.
      9.38.3.7. Preparatory Command. After starting parameters have been achieved,
      number 1 starts the exercise with the preparatory command, “Texan 1, ready”, to which
      number 2 responds with, “Texan 2, ready.” If starting parameters have not yet been
      achieved, number 2 responds with the appropriate alibi (“Texan 2, standby airspeed”),
      and then calls ready (“Texan 2, ready”) when within starting parameters.
      9.38.3.8. Execution Command. At this point, number 1 gives the command of
      execution: “Texan 2, cleared to maneuver.” Number 2 acknowledges with “2.” Both
      aircraft begin the exercise by initiating a 15-degree bank turn into each other. Number 1
      remains a stable platform, and number 2 varies the bank as necessary to maintain a zero
      LOS picture. Using 15-degree bank turns slows the rate of change and allows sufficient
      time to recognize and discuss how a collision course is evident due to decreasing range,
      increasing closure, no LOS, and aspect forward of the 3/9 line. The most significant cues
      to take note of are the zero LOS and positive closure.
      9.38.3.9. Out-of-Plane Maneuver. No later than 500-foot slant range, number 2 will
      initiate an out-of-plane maneuver to avoid a collision. If the reposition maneuver is
      initiated at the 500-foot minimum-range limit, number 2 should be very cognizant of
      remaining outside of the 300-foot bubble.
      9.38.3.10. Avoid 300-Foot Bubble. To avoid penetrating the 300-foot bubble, number 2
      should pull vertically out-of-plane and reposition the lift vector to number 1‘s high 6
      o‘clock. If it appears that number 2 will penetrate the 300-foot bubble, initiate a KIO
      regardless of your position in the formation. Take any action necessary to avoid a
      collision.
      9.38.3.11. Evasive Action. In the event evasive action is required, number 1 facilitates
      separation by rolling wings level and bunting the nose over to help create lateral and
      vertical separation. Number 2 should aggressively pull to number 1‘s high 6 o‘clock. The
      contract within the formation is that number 1 will go low, and number 2 will go high.
      9.38.3.12. Termination. Terminate the exercise with a radio call. Under normal
      circumstances, number 2 initiates the termination drill when verbal instruction between
      its crewmembers, relative to the exercise, is complete.
9.39. Blind Exercise:
   9.39.1. Objective. Demonstrate the correct lost sight procedures in the event one or both
   aircraft lose sight of each other.
   9.39.2. Description. The exercise exposes pilots to a real lost sight situation in a scripted
   setup to practice the procedures, including verbal coordination, required to facilitate safe
206                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


  separation and an expeditions rejoin. The ensuing possibility for a high aspect rejoin can
  effectively demonstrate lateral and vertical turning room requirements in relation to turn
  circle geometry, range, closure, AA, LOS, HCA, pursuit options, and out-of-plane
  maneuvering.
  9.39.3. Procedure:
      9.39.3.1. Altitude. As required, 100 feet.
      9.39.3.2. Airspeed. 180 5 KIAS.9.39.3.3. Heading. Reference heading 5 degrees.
      9.39.3.3. Power. Approximately 50 percent torque (as required to maintain 180 plus or
      minus 5 KIAS).
      9.39.3.4. Exercise Setup. Set up the exercise from fingertip or route formation. Before
      the exercise begins, number 1 announces the exercise, “Texan, standby blind exercise,
      reference heading xxx.” Number 2 acknowledges “2.” When ready to begin, number 1
      gives the execution command, “Texan, turn away,” and number 2 acknowledges “2.”
      Both aircraft then turn away from each other using 45 degrees of bank to a heading 90
      degrees from the reference heading. Number 2 calls blind with altitude after losing sight
      (“Texan 2, blind, nine thousand”). Because number 2 is assumed to be visual unless
      calling blind, number 2 conveys the situation with a minimum of ―blind‖ and ―altitude‖.
      The immediate concern must be to establish altitude separation between the aircraft.
      When number 1 is also blind, number 1 calls blind and immediately establishes altitude
      separation of at least 1,000 feet for each aircraft (“Texan 1, blind, nine thousand; Texan 2
      maintain eight thousand”).
      9.39.3.5. Altitude Deconfliction. Once altitude deconfliction is established and
      acknowledged, the potential for collision within the formation has been effectively
      eliminated as long as both aircraft remain at the assigned altitude. Only after altitude
      assignments are established and acknowledged will number 1 begin coordination to
      rendezvous the flight. Number 2 must inform number 1 if unable to expeditiously attain
      and maintain the assigned altitude. It is assumed that number 2 is complying with the
      altitude assignment unless informing number 1 otherwise.
      9.39.3.6. Vertical Buffer. Once a vertical buffer is established, number 1 may begin to
      coordinate for a rejoin by establishing common headings or a rendezvous point,
      according to the preflight briefing (e.g., center radial or DME, orbits over a ground
      reference, etc.). The key to expeditious visual acquisition in a blind situation is effective
      communication from both aircraft within the formation (heading, radial, DME, ground
      references, etc). Number 1 is responsible for coordinating the rejoin. Avoid unnecessary
      radio communication, while remaining cognizant that extended pauses on the radio may
      lead to lack of positional awareness and excess time trying to achieve visual acquisition.
      9.39.3.7. Regain Visual. Whoever regains visual first should talk the other pilot‘s eyes
      onto the other aircraft by using relative clock position (bearing) from the blind aircraft,
      elevation (in degrees) and range (“Texan 2, visual is at your 10 o’clock, 20 high, 2
      miles”). If number 2 is visual but number 1 is still blind, number 2 may provide
      recommended actions to facilitate visual between both aircraft (―Texan 1, recommend
      reference 090 heading, visual will be at your right 3 o’clock, slightly low, 3,000 feet‖).
      The FL must ensure the preflight briefing includes a thorough discussion of visual cues
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   207


      and ways to accomplish a high aspect rejoin. Figure 9.24 shows a graphical depiction of
      the blind exercise.

Figure 9.24. Blind Exercise.




      9.39.3.8. Exercise Concludes. The exercise concludes with both aircraft visual, and
      number 1 directing a rejoin or another position before proceeding to the next exercise or
      profile event. A terminate communication drill is not necessary because visual calls
      effectively signal an end to the blind situation and a transition to visual formation. If at
      any point after calling visual, visual contact is lost and not quickly regained, apply the
      appropriate blind procedures again to ensure separation.
   9.39.4. Technique. Figure 9.25 shows a recommended technique to turn a high aspect
   rejoin scenario into a more normal rejoin situation.

9.40. Extended Trail (ET). ET is divided into three distinct levels that demonstrate practical
application of the fundamental formation concepts in a building block approach.
   9.40.1. Objectives. Use lead, lag, and pure pursuit options, combined with lift vector
   placement to practice three-dimensional maneuvering in relation to another aircraft.
       9.40.1.1. Number 1. Provide a stable platform with consistent, predictable roll rates and
       no sudden changes in back stick pressure.
       9.40.1.2. Number 2. Maneuver within the fighting wing cone through proper pursuit
       curve and lift vector application with a fixed power setting.
   9.40.2. Description. ET is flown from the fighting wing position. The process of analyzing
   and solving angular, range, closure, and LOS problems requires an understanding of the
   consequences of flying each pursuit option and lift vector placement.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                   209


    9.40.3. Procedures (General Training Rules):
       9.40.3.1. The Bubble. A spherical safety airspace buffer surrounding each aircraft. The
       300-foot bubble is a safety of flight limit that surrounds each aircraft. If an aircraft is
       inside the 300-foot bubble during ET, call ―knock-it-off.‖
           9.40.3.1.1. The ET maneuvering limit is 500-foot slant range. Momentary deviations
           within 500 feet are acceptable if it is quickly recognized and remedied. If unable to
           quickly regain the fighting wing cone, call ―terminate.‖
           9.40.3.1.2. Abrupt turn reversals by number 1 are prohibited. Abrupt turn reversals
           are turns in one direction followed by a rapid, unanticipated roll in the opposite
           direction.
           9.40.3.1.3. ET is flown two-ship only.
           9.40.3.1.4. Do not maneuver over-the-top in Level III if number 1 is blind or number
           2 is not in a position to go over-the-top. Instead, number 1 transitions to Level II
           maneuvering until both of these requirements are satisfied prior to initiating an over-
           the-top maneuver (see Table 9.5).
           9.40.3.1.5. Minimum airspeed for extended trail is 100 knots. High power settings
           (greater than 60 percent torque), combined with high AOA (stick shaker), and slow
           airspeed (less than approximately 40 KIAS), can result in an unintentional torque roll.
           If airspeed, G, and AOA are not sufficient to continue a maneuver, terminate or
           knock-it-off as appropriate.

       9.40.3.2. ET Entry. At an appropriate energy level (180 to 200 KIAS and
       approximately the middle of the altitude block), number 1 directs the ET with a radio
       call: “Texan 2, go ET level 1/2/3.” Number 2 responds with “2.” Number 1 makes a
       moderate G turn away from number 2 at MAX power. Number 2 maneuvers into the
210                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      fighting wing cone and calls, “Texan 2, in” before number 1 begins maneuvering. Both
      aircraft then set and maintain the briefed power setting throughout the exercise.
      9.40.3.3. ET Transition or Termination. When the desired learning objectives are met,
      number 1 may direct a transition to another level of maneuvering or terminate.
         9.40.3.3.1. To transition to another level of maneuvering, number 1 calls the new
         level: “Texan, go ET level 3.” Number 2 acknowledges “2.” Set the new, briefed
         power setting if required after number 2 acknowledges the transition.
         9.40.3.3.2. If number 2 wants number 1 to discontinue maneuvering (such as during
         loss of spacing), notify number 1 with a ―terminate‖ call and state the reason. Number
         1 directs the formation as required and may subsequently resume maneuvering or
         initiate a reform/rejoin.
         9.40.3.3.3. To end the exercise, number 1 or number 2 calls ―terminate.‖ Number 1
         may reduce power when number 2 is in sight or when number 2 acknowledges the
         terminate call. Number 2 will then maintain the fighting wing position until Number 1
         directs a reform or another formation position (except close trail).
  9.40.4. Post-ET Check. After each ET exercise, number 1 conducts a fuel and G check
  using the radio. For example, number 1 says “Texan, ops check; Texan is 800, 4 Gs,” and
  number 2 responds, “Texan 2 same” if within 50 pounds and .5 Gs. Report the maximum G
  reading on all G checks. Reset the G meter if no over-G observed.
  9.40.5. Flying ET (General). Each pilot is responsible for taking the necessary action to
  avoid a collision; however, it is number 2‘s primary responsibility not to hit number 1.
  Because of the dynamic nature of ET, the potential for collision is increased, and flying ET
  requires uncompromising flight discipline. Any pilot in either aircraft must call ―terminate‖
  or ―knock-it-off‖ if appropriate.
      9.40.5.1. Number 1:
         9.40.5.1.1. Number 1 is a training platform for number 2. Continually monitor G
         loading, and remember that number 2 typically requires more G than number 1 to
         maintain position. Generally, look for number 2 behind the wing in the 4 to 5 o‘clock
         or 7 to 8 o‘clock position, and be more vigilant if number 2 strays from the cone
         parameters. If necessary, terminate or transition to the next lower level of ET until
         number 2 can maintain the fighting wing cone. Monitor number 2‘s aspect, range,
         closure, HCA, and LOS for the possibility of an inadvertent 3/9 line or bubble
         violation. Do not delay calling KIO if it is evident one of these situations is about to
         occur. It is far more desirable to KIO prior to the excursion than to see the situation
         developing and wait for it to happen.
         9.40.5.1.2. Tight, high-G maneuvers are of little value if number 2 is unable to
         maintain proper position. Never maneuver in an unpredictable or abrupt manner that
         may force number 2 inside the bubble or forward of the 3/9 line.
      9.40.5.2. Number 2. Generally, use varying degrees of lead pursuit to maintain the
      fighting wing cone during ET. Closure, range, aspect, HCAs, and LOS rate changes can
      occur rapidly, so be prepared to maneuver accordingly. Pause momentarily to see how
      rapidly number 1 is moving in the canopy (LOS/LOS rate), predict number 1‘s flight
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  211


     path, and then maneuver by selecting the appropriate pursuit option and proper lift vector
     placement. Use pure and lag pursuit judiciously to avoid high aspect, HCAs, and LOS
     rates. Normally, little time is spent in lag pursuit. Use terminate procedures to cease
     maneuvering if unable to maintain position.
  9.40.6. Flying ET (Level I):
     9.40.6.1. Number 1. Begin ET Level I with a radio call (“Texan 2, go ET, level 1”).
     After number 2 acknowledges the Level I call, enter a moderate G turn of approximately
     2 Gs. Set power to maintain a 30- to 60-degree bank turn with approximately 50 percent
     power.
     9.40.6.2. Number 2. Attempt to use the same power setting as number 1 to explore and
     maneuver within the fighting wing cone using the appropriate pursuit geometry and lift
     vector placement. Notice how difficult it is to stabilize in any one position without use of
     power. Use pursuit options and lift vector placement to stay within parameters and
     explore the quadrants of the fighting wing cone.
  9.40.7. Flying ET (Level II):
     9.40.7.1. Number 1. Begin ET Level II with a radio call (“Texan 2, go ET level 2”).
     After number 2 acknowledges the Level II call, select MAX power, and turn away from
     number 2. After number 2 transmits that they are established in the fighting wing cone,
     reset the power at 85 percent torque. For low and medium altitudes, 85 percent torque is a
     good power setting to maintain energy. Higher altitudes and air temperatures or a low
     initial energy state may require the use of MAX power during maneuvering. In these
     instances, number 1 makes a radio call directing the use of a higher power setting if not
     previously briefed. Once the desired learning objectives have been met, transition to
     Level III maneuvering or terminate the maneuver.
     9.40.7.2. Number 2. As number 1 turns away after calling for the exercise, maneuver to
     the fighting wing cone, call “Texan 2 in,” and set 85 percent torque (unless briefed or
     directed otherwise). During maneuvers, predict number 1‘s flight path and maneuver in
     relation to it. This requires constant analysis of number 1‘s POM as well as relative
     aspect, range, closure, HCA, and LOS. Realize that pursuit curves exist in both the
     vertical and horizontal planes.
         9.40.7.2.1. Sometimes, exaggerated pursuit curve adjustments are required to remain
         in position. Normally, these type of corrections are only required for a short period of
         time. A move toward lag pursuit may generally be the best solution to mitigate these
         problems, but most of the time merely using less lead pursuit will adequately solve
         the problem.
         9.40.7.2.2. Intentional lag rolls are generally not required to maintain the cone.
         Transitory periods in number 1‘s high or low 6 o‘clock position are acceptable.
         However, avoid stagnating in the 5 to 7 o‘clock position. Attempt to maintain the 30-
         to 45-degree cone away from number 1‘s high or low 6 o‘clock position.
  9.40.8. Flying ET (Level III):
     9.40.8.1. Number 1. Begin ET Level III with a radio call (“Texan 2, go ET, level 3”).
     After number 2 acknowledges the Level III call, select MAX power, and turn away from
 212                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       number 2. Maneuvers are not flown with the precise parameters of contact flying.
       Attitudes and airspeeds vary for effective training, area orientation, visual lookout, and
       smoothness. Consider number 2‘s skill level while maneuvering to prevent exceeding
       number 2‘s capabilities, but challenge with hard turns, modified lazy eights, barrel rolls,
       and over-the-top maneuvers. Number 1 will not attempt to force number 2 to overshoot.
       Ensure adequate airspeed is available for over-the-top maneuvers.
       9.40.8.2. Number 2:
          9.40.8.2.1. As number 1 turns away after calling for the exercise, maneuver to the
          fighting wing cone and call “Texan 2 in.” Energy conservation becomes more critical
          at higher G and in vertical maneuvering. There is a balance between the demands
          placed on the aircraft to maintain position; either nose track or energy is more
          desirable during ET maneuvering in order to maintain relative position on number 1.
          High AOA, buffet, and/or stick shaker indicate that the aircraft is losing energy.
          When encountering these cues, prioritize between nose track and energy (airspeed). If
          nose track is more important, sacrifice airspeed by pulling enough back stick pressure
          to facilitate continued nose track. Realize that sacrificing airspeed for nose track may
          eventually result in excessive spacing due to airspeed differential. If number 1 is in a
          hard turn, relaxing back stick pressure may preserve energy or increase airspeed but
          can result in excessive spacing. Conservation of energy is critical during Level III of
          the ET exercise. The key is to maneuver in relation to number 1, and balance the need
          for nose track or energy through proper pursuit selection and lift vector placement.
          9.40.8.2.2. The concepts used in Levels I and II maneuvering apply equally to Level
          III; however, the addition of over-the-top maneuvering makes the effect of gravity
          more noticeable. If number 1‘s nose position (longitudinal axis of the aircraft)
          remains stationary below the horizon, the aircraft is likely to be accelerating for an
          over-the-top maneuver. To properly manage this situation, it is generally prudent to
          ―lag at the bottom, lead at the top.‖ ―Lagging at the bottom‖ means number 2 should
          delay pulling up into the vertical until noticing LOS in the vertical (putting number
          2‘s nose in lag) to gain airspeed after number 1 has already started tracking up in the
          vertical. At the apex of the maneuver, unless increased range is desired, generally
          sacrifice airspeed for nose track and attempt to beat number 1‘s nose through the
          horizon (―lead at the top‖). If range and plane are satisfactory, attempt to hit over-the-
          top with the nose through the horizon before, or at the same time as number 1, with
          fuselages aligned (zero HCA or angle off).

Section 9G—Two-ship Tactical Formation

9.41. Overview. ―Tactical‖ is an umbrella term covering several formations characterized by
increased separation between the members of the flight. Tactical is the primary formation flown
when employing fighter aircraft. It is designed to optimize weapons and radar employment while
improving visual lookout and increasing maneuverability. LAB is the most basic tactical
formation and is most commonly referred to as ―tactical.‖
9.42. Responsibilities. The basic combat unit employed by fighter aircraft is the element. The
element consists of two aircraft: the element lead and the wingman. Only two-ship tactical
formation is flown in the T-6. Therefore, the element lead is referred to as number 1, and the
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  213


wingman is referred to as number 2. Regardless of the variety of tactical formations being flown,
some basic principles apply:
   9.42.1. Number 1 is primarily responsible for maneuvering the formation, and number 2 is
   primarily responsible for maintaining formation position and deconfliction. However, there
   are circumstances where these roles are reversed.
   9.42.2. During turns of 90 degrees or more, it is understood number 2 will lose sight of
   number 1 at some point in the turn. When this occurs, flight path deconfliction roles reverse,
   and number 1 must assume this responsibility. Once number 2 is visual with number 1 again,
   number 2 regains the primary responsibility for collision avoidance.
   9.42.3. Number 2‘s primary reference for heading and airspeed is number 1. Number 1 must
   crosscheck number 2 to monitor its position, and number 2 must back number 1 up by
   monitoring area orientation, navigation, etc.
   9.42.4. Both aircraft share equal responsibility for visual lookout. LAB provides excellent
   lookout capability(one of the primary reasons for flying tactical LAB). Scan patterns should
   include the extremes above and below the horizon.
   9.42.5. Tactical formations are normally flown at airspeeds near cornering velocity, but
   other airspeeds may be flown as required. Unless otherwise briefed, the standard airspeed for
   T-6 tactical formation is 200 KIAS. A low MOA should be used whenever possible to
   maximize aircraft performance.
9.43. LAB (Tactical) Parameters. The parameters of T-6 tactical formation are defined as
2,000 to 3,000 feet lateral separation, LAB to 10 degrees aft, with a vertical stack of up to 500
feet (Figure 9.26). Flying with a lateral separation of 2,000 to 2,500 feet in a low MOA and
2,500 to 3,000 feet in a high MOA with a vertical stack of 300 feet is optimal for the T-6‘s
performance and will most closely represent what pilots will see in follow-on training.
 214                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 9.26. LAB Tactical Formation.




   9.43.1. Number 1. Send the formation to tactical by porpoising the aircraft or making a
   radio call (“Texan, go tactical left/right side”). To enhance training, number 1 may add a
   reference heading and altitude to the radio call (“Texan, go tactical left/right side, reference
   heading three-six-zero, nine thousand”). The porpoise signal will not be given from
   fingertip. LAB tactical requires number 1 to maintain relatively strict formation parameters
   (heading and airspeed). Failure to do so will require number 2 to devote excessive time to
   element integrity (maintaining position) at the expense of mutual support. Small heading
   changes should be minimized. Small course corrections may usually be accomplished
   through check turns. Turns of more than 30 degrees are usually accomplished by means of a
   delayed turn (45 degrees through 90 degrees). A cross turn or hook turn can be used to
   reverse the flight path 180 degrees.
   9.43.2. Number 2. When sent to tactical, clear in the direction you are going, and smoothly
   initiate a small turn (approximately 10 degrees) to a divergent heading while maintaining
   briefed tactical airspeed. When you are the proper lateral distance, turn back and align the
   fuselages. Always strive for LAB, but lateral spacing and vertical stack within the parameters
   depends on factors such as training objectives, location of the sun, presence of haze, or other
   obstructions to visibility. If out of position when maneuvering in tactical, regain the proper
   fore and aft position, lateral spacing, and vertical stack (in that order), while maintaining
   tactical airspeed. Number 2‘s primary reference is number 1, not the EHSI. Although number
   1 calls for a 90-degree left turn, number 1 is not required to turn exactly 90 degrees. Number
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       215


   2 is responsible for staying in position. Number 2 can over or under turn and vary airspeed to
   facilitate number 2‘s position correction.
9.44. Visual References and Corrections:
   9.44.1. Fore/Aft Position:
      9.44.1.1. Visual References. The FCP visual reference for LAB is to put number 1
      slightly in front of the leading edge of number 2‘s aircraft (abeam position). Visual
      references for 10 degrees aft from the FCP follow:
          9.44.1.1.1. Number 1. Number 2 over the aft wingtip navigation light.
          9.44.1.1.2. Number 2. Number 1‘s aft wingtip navigation light superimposed on
          number 1‘s center canopy bow.
      9.44.1.2. Corrections. If ahead, and the environment permits, trade airspeed for altitude
      to ease back into position while maintaining energy. If behind, trade altitude for airspeed
      to regain LAB position. In either case, descend and accelerate or climb and decelerate to
      regain position. Check turns may also be used to regain LAB.
   9.44.2. Lateral Spacing:
      9.44.2.1. Visual References. The FCP visual references are as follows: at 2,000 feet
      lateral separation, number 1‘s aircraft appears slightly larger than the flash guard. The
      ejection seats and the pilots‘ helmets are also both visible. At 2,500 feet, number 1‘s
      aircraft is slightly smaller than the flash guard, the ejection seats are still discernable, but
      you can no longer see the helmets. At 3,000 feet from the FCP, number 1‘s aircraft is
      about three-fourths the size of the flash guard, the canopy begins to blend in with the
      fuselage, and the prop blade is still visible.
      9.44.2.2. Corrections. It is critical to ensure both aircraft are established on the same
      heading, as even a small difference will quickly place the aircraft out of position. Check
      turns are used to make forward/aft corrections of LAB. Small turns into or away from
      number 1 are used to correct lateral spacing. Increased power or vertical energy will
      normally be required in conjunction with a correction, as it will otherwise put number 2
      out of position.
   9.44.3. Vertical Stack. Use the altimeter to verify the vertical stack. Strive for 200 to 300
   feet, but no more than 500 feet. Using a vertical stack greater than 500 feet will result in
   either the FCP or RCP pilot losing sight of number 1 under the wing when forward or aft of
   position. Ensure both pilots maintain visual.
9.45. Tactical Turns:
   9.45.1. Initiating the Turn. Radio calls or visual signals may be used to signal tactical
   turns. For example, the radio call for a delayed 90-degree turn would be “Texan, 90
   left/right.” No radio response is required from number 2. All tactical turns except a cross
   turn, shackle or hook turn into number 2 may be signaled visually. Number 1 should show
   number 2 a large wing flash when signaling a tactical turn to avoid confusion with minor
   course corrections (usually 30 degrees of bank or less). If needed to attract number 2‘s
   attention, a ―zipper‖ or rapid double-click of the microphone may be combined with the
   visual signal. Number 2 should interpret number 1‘s visual signal as a directive to start
216                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


  turning. While a delayed 90-degree is the most common turn, after observing a wing flash
  from number 1, number 2 should immediately initiate a contract turn in the correct direction
  and watch for an additional signal. Once number 2 loses sight of number 1, it is assumed to
  be a delayed 90-degree turn. The same is true with a turn into the wingman. When number 1
  is observed turning into the element, number 2 should be prepared for number 1 to roll out. If
  number 1 continues turning until number 2 sees it is time to turn for a 90-degree turn, then it
  is assumed to be a 90-degree turn.
  9.45.2. The Contract. All aircraft need to adhere to a ―contract‖ as the turns are executed to
  ensure turn radii are similar. Use the following parameters for contract turns: 200 KIAS,
  MAX power, G to hold airspeed (approximately 2 to 3 Gs), and a level turn. Number 2 may
  vary altitude and Gs as necessary near the end of the turn in order to maintain formation
  position. At lower altitudes, all aircraft must remain aware of terrain elevation, descent rate,
  and bank angle.
  9.45.3. Deconfliction. Number 2 takes the initiative to deconflict from number 1. Typically,
  number 2 will ensure separation by turning above number 1‘s flight path whenever possible
  (the concept of ―number 2 always goes high‖). When unable due to position (e.g., stacked
  low), environment, or other reasons, number 2 should telegraph his or her intentions to
  number 1 by positively maneuvering the aircraft. Both number 1 and number 2 are ultimately
  responsible for flight path deconfliction, clearing during the turns and taking appropriate
  evasive action as required.
  9.45.4. Check Turn. The check turn is used for small heading corrections (usually no more
  than 30 degrees) or to realign the formation. Initiate the turn by transmitting "Texan, check
  (number of degrees to turn) left/right.” Number 2 does not acknowledge this call. Both
  aircraft turn simultaneously using a contract turn.
  9.45.5. Delayed 90-Degree Turns:
      9.45.5.1. Turns Into Number 2:
         9.45.5.1.1. Number 1. If the turn is called over the radio, number 1 begins the
         contract turn immediately after the call. Otherwise, number 1‘s contract turn into
         number 2 signals the turn.
         9.45.5.1.2. Number 2. As number 1 begins the turn, continue straight ahead and
         deconflict the turn. Initiate a 90-degree contract turn when you see number 1's aircraft
         almost pointing at you (before you see a rapid increase of number 1‘s LOS). If
         number 1 disappears below the wing (due to a high stack), start a turn 1 second after
         the aircraft disappears. Remember, turning cues depend on turning radius, which is
         affected by altitude. If out of position, vary the timing and G loading of your turn
         (based on number 1's LOS) to finish the turn in position (Figure 9.27). Generally,
         when too close or too far aft, begin the turn earlier. When too wide or too far forward,
         begin the turn later.
      9.45.5.2. Turns Away From Number 2:
         9.45.5.2.1. Number 1. Delay the turn as described in paragraph 9.45.5.1.2.
         9.45.5.2.2. Number 2. Begin a contract turn as soon as number 1 signals for the turn
         (radio call or wing flash). Roll out after approximately 90 degrees of turn. When
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               217


          number 1 rolls out, number 2 is responsible for being in position and must make
          necessary adjustments.

Figure 9.27. Delayed 90-Degree Left Turn Into Number 2.




   9.45.6. Turns Less Than 90 Degrees (Communication-Out [Comm-Out]). Any time
   number 1 initiates a comm-out turn, it is assumed to be a 90-degree turn. Number 1 will use
   the following procedures to indicate the turn is less than 90 degrees.
      9.45.6.1. Away from Number 2. When number 1 signals with a wing flash, number 2
      commences a contract turn into number 1. Number 1 ―flashes‖ into number 2 with a large
      wing flash toward number 2 when number 2 reaches the desired rollout heading. Number
      1 then maneuvers to attain LAB on the opposite side. When number 1 rolls out on
      heading, number 2 regains the responsibility to maintain position. Lead will maneuver to
      the opposite side of the wingman in LAB position. After lead rolls out, the wingman is
      responsible for obtaining the correct spacing and position.
      9.45.6.2. Into Number 2. Number 1 initiates a turn and rolls out on the desired heading.
      Number 2 maneuvers as required to achieve a tactical position on the other side of
      number 1.
   9.45.7. Delayed 45-Degree Turns:
 218                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       9.45.7.1. Turns Into Number 2:
          9.45.7.1.1. Number 1. If the turn is called over the radio, number 1 begins the turn
          immediately after the call. Otherwise, number 1‘s turn into number 2 signals the turn.
          During comm-out turns, number 1 must ensure the rollout occurs before number 2
          begins a delayed 90-degree turn. If number 2 begins a 90-degree turn, number 1
          should use the radio to tell number 2 to roll out.
          9.45.7.1.2. Number 2. As number 1 begins the turn, continue straight ahead and
          deconflict by obtaining vertical clearance. After number 1 starts to turn, maneuver as
          required to attain LAB on the other side of number 1‘s aircraft (Figure 9.28). One
          method is to continue straight ahead until number 1 crosses your flight path, then
          maneuver to the opposite side and roll out in position on the new heading.
          Alternately, just as number 1 rolls out, execute an aggressive turn toward number 1
          while maintaining vertical separation and maneuvering airspeed. After crossing
          number 1‘s flight path, reverse the turn and flow out to the correct tactical position on
          the side opposite from where the 45 turn started. Either method is acceptable; the
          latter is more expeditious.

Figure 9.28. Delayed 45-Degree Left Turn Into Number 2.




       9.45.7.2. Turns Away From Number 2:
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      219


          9.45.7.2.1. Number 1. Delay the turn as described in paragraph 9.45.7.1.2. Number
          1 will maneuver to the opposite side of number 2 in a LAB position.
          9.45.7.2.2. Number 2. When directed, begin a contract turn into number 1. Number
          1 signals number 2‘s rollout by beginning a turn into number 2. Number 2 rolls out,
          and number 1 maneuvers as described above and initially corrects the formation
          position on the other side of number 2. Once the formation is back to straight-and-
          level flight, number 2 regains the responsibility for proper formation position.
   9.45.8. In-Place Turns. Use an in-place turn when you want the formation to maneuver in
   one direction at the same time. To initiate, number 1 transmits “Texan, in-place 90
   left/right.” (Number 2 does not acknowledge this call.) Both aircraft turn at the same time—
   in the same direction—using contract turns. If executed from LAB tactical, a 90-degree turn
   will put the formation in trail at whatever lateral spacing existed prior to the turn. Another in-
   place 90-degree turn in either direction will return the formation to LAB.
   9.45.9. Hook Turns. During a hook turn (Figure 9.29), the formation turns 180 degrees
   with both aircraft performing a contract turn at the same time in the same direction.

Figure 9.29. Hook Turn, Left, Into Number 2.




      9.45.9.1. Turns Into Number 2. A hook turn into number 2 must be called over the
      radio (“Texan, hook right/left”). Number 2 does not acknowledge this call.
          9.45.9.1.1. Number 1. During the first half of the turn, number 1 is responsible for
          maintaining visual and deconflicting flight paths. Match number 2‘s fuselage through
          the first half of the turn. About halfway through the turn, number 1 will lose sight of
          number 2, and number 2 will then pick up deconfliction duties.
          9.45.9.1.2. Number 2. Number 2 will be unable to maintain visual during the first
          half of the turn. After passing through 90 degrees of turn, begin looking for number 1
          while flying the contract. Once visual is attained, play the turn to roll out in position
          after approximately 180 degrees of turn.
220                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      9.45.9.2. Turns Away From Number 2. Hook turns away from number 2 may be
      signaled visually by a wing flash or called over the radio. If initiated with a wing flash,
      number 1 will begin turning when number 2 begins the turn. Number 1‘s immediate turn
      tells number 2 this is a hook turn. For the first half of the turn, number 2 should fly a
      contract turn while referencing number 1. He or she should match number 1‘s fuselage
      through 90 degrees of turn to maintain position and use caution to avoid number 1‘s prop
      wash. Shortly after halfway through the turn, number 1 should acquire and maintain sight
      of number 2. If this turn is flown properly, number 2 will be in position at the rollout
      (exactly 180 degrees of turn). If not, he or she must maneuver to obtain the proper
      spacing and position.
  9.45.10. Shackle:
      9.45.10.1. Use a shackle to place number 2 on the opposite side or to allow number 2 to
      regain the correct position. Initiate the shackle by transmitting, "Texan, shackle." Number
      2 does not acknowledge this call. Both aircraft simultaneously turn about 30 to 45
      degrees into one another to attain about 60 to 90 degrees of HCA. Number 2 normally
      flies directly over or under number 1 (maintain the current vertical stack). After crossing
      paths, number 1 initiates a turn reversal, that number 2 matches, back to the original
      heading (Figure 9.30).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                 221


Figure 9.30. Shackle.




      9.45.10.2. When out of position at the start of the shackle, the formation can employ
      several methods to expeditiously regain position. If number 2 is forward, number 1 may
      elect to maintain the current heading. In this situation, number 2 will aggressively bid
      toward number 1 with approximately 90 degrees of HCA. Once across number 1‘s flight
      path, number 2 should reverse the turn and flow out into position on the opposite side
      from where the maneuver started. If number 2 is aft, he or she may choose to continue
      straight ahead, and number 1 would maneuver as described above.
   9.45.11. Cross Turn. Cross turns (Figure 9.31) are another 180-degree reversal option.
   Both aircraft make a contract turn into each other. Number 2 is responsible for maintaining
   altitude stack to ensure flight path deconfliction. Two basic problems occur during the turn.
   The first is reacquiring visual contact with the other aircraft. The second is that the turn
   performance may cause too much lateral spacing. It is imperative that all aircrew members
   reacquire visual contact with the other aircraft as soon as possible.
 222                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 9.31. Cross Turn.




       9.45.11.1. Execution. Cross turns are executed on verbal command from number 1:
       "Texan, cross turn." Number 2 does not acknowledge this call. Both aircraft immediately
       commence a contract turn toward each other. Aircraft should cross after 60 to 90 degrees
       of turn and continue their turn through 180 degrees of turn. The flight is now on a
       reciprocal heading. Lateral separation may be wide even though the original spacing was
       correct. To correct this, perform a shackle after a cross turn.
       9.45.11.2. Blind. If the other aircraft is not reacquired call, "blind." If number 2 is blind,
       number 1 will be directive, and may direct a shackle if visual with number 2. In this case,
       it is number 1‘s responsibility to maintain altitude deconfliction while attempting to talk
       number 2's eyes onto his aircraft. If number 1 is blind, number 2 will talk number 1‘s
       eyes onto his aircraft while maintaining aircraft deconfliction responsibility. It is possible
       for neither aircraft to regain sight after the cross turn. In this case, both aircraft will
       maintain the reciprocal of the cross turn entry heading until directed otherwise by number
       1. Number 1 will ensure altitude deconfliction.
9.46. Fluid Turns. These turns are used to maneuver a formation when there is very little G or
excess thrust available (heavy weight and/or higher altitudes). If a 180-degree turn is required,
combine the techniques for two 90-degree turns. The radio call for a fluid turn is “Texan, fluid
left/right.” No acknowledgement is required. Number 1 will begin turning immediately
following the radio call.
   9.46.1. Contract. Fluid turns are almost purely ―geometry‖ turns with power settings
   normally constant. Number 1 will normally make heading changes in 90-degree increments
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    223


   using approximately 45 degrees of bank while maintaining airspeed and altitude. If a 180-
   degree turn is required, combine the techniques for two 90-degree turns.
   9.46.2. Turns Into Number 2. As number 2, start a turn in the same direction as number 1.
   One technique is to use less bank angle than number 1 and maintain it until you cross over in
   front of number 1. Another way is to initially match number 1's bank and momentarily roll
   out of the turn or bank in the opposite direction to check number 1's position. Depending
   upon number 1's position at the start of the turn, you should normally have 20 to 30 degrees
   of the turn completed as number 1 passes your 6 o'clock position. For example, if, as number
   2, you were behind when the turn started, you may want to delay the cross, or if ahead, cross
   earlier. Once you have crossed number 1‘s flight path, increase bank and lower the nose to
   pick up airspeed, if applicable. Play the turn to assume proper spacing. Use altitude to gain or
   reduce airspeed to arrive in the proper position as number 1 rolls out of the turn.
   9.46.3. Turns Away from Number 2. Number 2 is immediately behind at the onset of the
   turn. He or she should roll into more bank than number 1 and lower the nose slightly to gain
   airspeed in order to move to the inside of the turn behind number 1. As the turn progresses,
   number 2 should reduce the bank to attain proper lateral spacing and trade excess airspeed
   for altitude as he or she approaches the LAB position. Remember that airspeed corrections
   should be made through the use of vertical while maintaining a fairly constant power setting.
9.47. Wedge. Wedge formation can be used when terrain, tactics, etc., require an increased
degree of flight maneuverability. The wedge position is primarily used in the low altitude
environment. Turns do not need to be called. Number 2 will maneuver as required to maintain
position. The wedge position is defined as 30 to 45 degrees off number 1‘s 6 o‘clock (3 to 4.5
AA) with a lateral spacing of 2,000-3,000 feet. Number 2 should stack up to 500 feet high (200
to 300 feet high is optimal) but will not fly lower than lead in the low altitude environment.
Number 2 will fly no higher than 500 feet above number 1 unless required to fly higher due to
obstacle clearance during turns. Putting number 1‘s aircraft on or below the horizon (no sky
showing between the aircraft and the horizon) will ensure a positive vertical stack.
9.48. Tactical Rejoins:
   9.48.1. Overview. Rejoins will be initiated with a wing rock or radio call. Number 2 will
   acknowledge all radio calls to rejoin. The standard platform for number 1 is 200 KIAS, 45
   degrees of bank, and level flight. Different parameters (180 to 200 KIAS and 30-45 degrees
   of bank) may be briefed or called on the radio. Number 2 should strive to maintain closure
   during the rejoin.
   9.48.2. Straight-Ahead Tactical Rejoin. Number 2 will rejoin to the side occupied when
   the rejoin was directed. Unlike a normal straight-ahead rejoin from a trail position, a tactical
   straight-ahead rejoin begins from a lateral spread. The mechanics of flying this maneuver
   will vary based on your position when initiating the rejoin. If necessary, maneuver vertically
   or laterally to gain sufficient spacing (turning room). Decrease the AA with lag pursuit by
   turning approximately 15 to 30 degrees, making a bid toward number 1‘s six o‘clock
   position. If forward LOS is not established by this initial heading change, it may be necessary
   to make another bid to number 1‘s six. Maintain sufficient power to achieve approximately
   10 to 20 knots of overtake. Be sure to eliminate the resulting angle off by aligning fuselages.
   At this point, the picture should look like the last 100 to 200 feet of a normal straight-ahead
   rejoin. After stabilizing (but not stopping) in this position, continue to move forward toward
 224                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   route and then into fingertip or the position directed by number 1. Number 2 accomplishes
   the rejoin without crossing number 1's 6 o'clock position.
   9.48.3. Turning Tactical Rejoins:
       9.48.3.1. Turns Into Number 2. Even before number 1 turns, excessive AA exists.
       Both lag pursuit and vertical turning room are required to decrease this angle. Number 2
       should use no more than 10 to 15 knots of overtake during turning tactical rejoins due to
       number 1‘s increased bank angle and turn rate. If stacked above number 1, use vertical
       turning room above number 1; if stacked below, use vertical turning room below number
       1, but use caution for excessive airspeed and a high asymmetric over-G potential.
          9.48.3.1.1. Vertical Stack Above Number 1. In this case, increase power and pull
          the aircraft toward number 1‘s high six. The visual will be lost momentarily, but since
          the maneuver is out of plane, it is safe to continue. When number 1 disappears under
          the nose, roll the aircraft in the opposite direction to look for number 1. Use caution
          not to turn (do not ―pull‖) the aircraft as you roll; this will keep number 1 under the
          nose. When the visual is regained, maintain heading toward the outside of number 1‘s
          turn until forward LOS is detected. At this point, roll and pull toward the rejoin line.
          Be careful when crossing number 1‘s 6 o‘clock to remain clear of his or her jetwash.
          Once established on the rejoin line, follow normal turning rejoin procedures.
          9.48.3.1.2. Vertical Stack Below Number 1. Make a level to slightly descending
          turn into number 1 while maintaining airspeed. As number 1 crosses the nose, reverse
          the turn to align the fuselages. This type of rejoin normally results in a flight path
          overshoot. As in an overshoot from a turning rejoin, pull to align the fuselages on the
          outside of the turn with aft LOS rate decreasing. Do not climb above number 1. When
          stabilized on the outside of the turn, pull toward the rejoin line just before forward
          LOS develops.
       9.48.3.2. Turns Away From Number 2. As soon as number 1 turns, number 2 is
       outside the turn and needs to maneuver to the inside of the turn with lead pursuit.
       Immediately apply MAX power and turn toward number 1, maneuver inside number 1‘s
       turn circle, and establish the desired rejoin line. Cross number 1‘s six o‘clock while
       remaining clear of his or her jetwash and assess your overtake. Once inside number 1‘s
       turn, use normal turning rejoin procedures. Excessive airspeed (greater than 10 to 15
       knots of closure) and/or lead pursuit will result in an overshoot of the turning rejoin line,
       and a breakout may be necessary.
9.49. ET Entry from Tactical:
   9.49.1. Overview. Entry into ET from tactical is accomplished with a 45-degree check turn
   away from number 2. Number 2 then quickly maneuvers to maintain pure pursuit, followed
   by number 1 reversing the turn to generate closure and expeditiously attain fighting wing
   parameters. Once number 2 has called in position, both aircraft will set the briefed power
   setting and commence extended trail maneuvering.
   9.49.2. Execution. Entry into ET from tactical is initiated with a radio call from number 1
   (“Texan 11, standby ET exercise level 1/2/3”). After responding with “2,” number 2
   maneuvers to 3,000 feet lateral separation. Once number 1 assesses both aircraft have
   achieved the correct starting parameters, he or she will call ready (“Texan 1 ready”),
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    225


   followed by number 2's response (“Texan 2 ready”). Number 1 then directs a check turn
   (“Texan, check 45 left/right”) and turns away from number 2, using a contract turn. Number
   2 does not roll out after the check turn but maneuvers as necessary to establish and maintain
   pure pursuit on number 1. As number 2 achieves pure pursuit, number 1 reverses turn
   direction while monitoring number 2. Number 2 maintains pure pursuit until reaching
   fighting wing parameters and then calls “Texan 2 in.” Both aircraft then set the briefed
   power setting and commence maneuvering.
9.50. Tactical Initial. Prior to initial, number 1 should position number 2 on the side opposite
the direction of the break and direct number 2 to tactical on that side. Number 1 should ensure
initial is of sufficient duration to allow number 2 to stabilize before the break.
   9.50.1. At the break point, number 1 smoothly turns to the downwind and delays power
   reduction until the turn is initiated.
   9.50.2. Number 2 breaks simultaneously with number 1 using power and lag pursuit to keep
   spacing in the break and on downwind. On downwind, number 2 should be slightly outside
   number 1‘s ground track.
   9.50.3. Number 2 flies a normal contact pattern. Perch points should be the same; however,
   number 2 should not follow a poorly flown pattern. Go around or break out if required.

Section 9H—Formation Recoveries

9.51. Objective. Lead the formation to landing in a safe and efficient manner.
   9.51.1. Description. Formation recoveries are similar to single-ship recoveries, but
   operational restrictions (WX minimums, RWY condition, winds, etc.) can significantly
   change recovery options.
   9.51.2. Procedure. WX can significantly complicate the recovery. In-flight checks may be
   difficult to perform in the WX (especially solo), and otherwise simple tasks such as changing
   radio frequencies can be challenging. Number 1 must consider number 2‘s capabilities when
   developing the recovery plan. In general, number 1 should avoid low power settings (less
   than 20 percent torque). Instead of reducing power below 20 percent torque, the speed brake
   coupled with a higher power setting may be used.
   9.51.3. Split-up in the Area:
       9.51.3.1. If single ship recovery is required, number 1 verifies number 2 has positional
       awareness, coordinates a new clearance for number 2, and clears number 2 off at the
       appropriate time.
       9.51.3.2. Number 1 normally coordinates the split-up in the MOA to minimize confusion
       and radio transmissions on the recovery.
       9.51.3.3. Number 2 will not depart the formation until number 1 has directed the
       formation to split up. Even if the controller gives vectors to number 2, number 2 is part of
       the formation and will not comply with or acknowledge air traffic controller directions
       until number 1 splits the formation with a radio call (“Texan 2, you are cleared off”).
   9.51.4. Descent to VFR Pattern:
226                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      9.51.4.1. If WX allows, number 1 can direct number 2 to a position (route or fighting
      wing) that enhances clearing and allows greater maneuverability.
      9.51.4.2. Once established at pattern altitude inside the entry point for the VFR pattern,
      all turns away from number 2 are echelon unless briefed otherwise.
      9.51.4.3. Prior to initial, number 1 should position number 2 on the side opposite the
      direction of the break. Number 1 should ensure the initial ground track is long enough to
      allow number 2 to stabilize before the break.
      9.51.4.4. At the break point, number 1 smoothly turns to the downwind and delays power
      reduction until the turn is initiated.
      9.51.4.5. After number 1‘s break, number 2 waits a minimum of 5 seconds before
      turning. Attain spacing in the break and on downwind. On downwind, number 2 should
      be slightly outside number 1‘s ground track.
      9.51.4.6. Number 1 and 2 fly normal contact patterns. Perch points should be the same;
      however, number 2 should not follow a poorly flown pattern. Go around or break out, if
      required.
      9.51.4.7. In crosswinds, number 1 normally lands on the downwind side of the RWY. If
      crosswinds are not a factor, number 1 will land on the cold side of the RWY (the side that
      both aircraft will turn off of after the aircraft is slowed sufficiently). Number 2 will land
      on the hot side and clear cold when the aircraft has slowed sufficiently.
      9.51.4.8. If splitting in the pattern after a formation low approach, the aircraft on the
      inside of the pattern pulls closed or turns crosswind first. If number 2 is on the inside,
      number 1 must visually clear in the turn direction, obtain clearance, and make a radio call
      clearing off number 2 (“Texan 2, you are cleared off”). Number 2 replies, “2” and
      proceeds as a single ship.
  9.51.5. Formation Approach. Formation instrument procedures are the same as for a single
  ship. Before starting an instrument penetration, number 1 determines if number 2 can be
  crossed under after the penetration or if it is necessary to position number 2 on the upwind
  side prior to penetration.
      9.51.5.1. Number 1 should position number 2 on the upwind side of the landing RWY.
      9.51.5.2. Number 1 directs configuration with a radio call or visual signal. Use a radio
      call in IMC. The gear and flaps are normally lowered with only one signal unless briefed
      otherwise. Formation approaches are flown with TO flaps.
      9.51.5.3. After internal confirmation, number 2 checks number 1‘s configuration and
      gives a thumbs-up signal. Number 1 checks number 2 and returns a thumbs-up if the
      configuration looks good.
      9.51.5.4. Number 1 transmits a ―gear down‖ call for both aircraft after configuration
      confirmation. Maintain 110 KIAS on the instrument approach unless winds dictate
      otherwise or electing to maintain 120 KIAS for a circling approach.
  9.51.6. Formation Landing. When out of the WX with the RWY in sight, number 1 lines
  up on the center of one side of the RWY and plans the touchdown approximately 1,000 feet
  down the RWY.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        227


      9.51.6.1. Stack level no earlier than glide path intercept or obtaining VMC, whichever
      occurs last, and no later than one-half mile from the RWY. To stack level vertically,
      place the pilot‘s helmet in the corresponding cockpit on the horizon. To stack level
      laterally, use the same references as on a formation takeoff. The increased lateral spacing
      increases the margin of safety if problems occur during touchdown or landing roll. (See
      Figure 9.32)

Figure 9.32. Stacked Level on Final.




      9.51.6.2. Approaching the overrun, number 2 should cross-check the RWY. Number 2
      uses number 1 as the primary reference during the flare and landing, but monitors the
      RWY and flight parameters to ensure a safe landing.
      9.51.6.3. Number 1 gradually reduces power during the round out. Number 2 must
      reduce power gradually to avoid falling out of position during the round out and flare.
      9.51.6.4. On the RWY, both aircraft maintain their side of the RWY. Normal braking
      technique is used regardless of the other aircraft‘s deceleration rate. If number 2 passes
      number 1 on landing roll, do not attempt to maintain position by over-braking.
      9.51.6.5. On landing roll, if the trailing aircraft is on the cold side, that aircraft will clear
      the preceding aircraft to the cold side when separation is established at a safe taxi speed
      (“Texan 1, cleared cold”). If the trailing aircraft is on the hot side, the aircrew clears
      themselves to cross.
   9.51.7. After Landing. Following a formation landing, the formation normally clears the
   RWY, checks in on ground frequency, and then taxis back as a formation. If the flight was
   split, either on recovery or in the VFR pattern, flight members normally taxi back single ship.
   9.51.8. Formation Go-Around:
      9.51.8.1. Number 1 smoothly adds power to approximately 75 percent torque, follows
      normal formation takeoff, and single-ship go-around procedures.
      9.51.8.2. If required to offset during the go-around, number 1 should confirm number 2‘s
      position and ensure number 2 has safe altitude and airspeed during maneuvering.
 228                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   9.51.9. Formation Missed Approach. The potential for lost wingman and for spatial
   disorientation is high. Smoothly advance power to approximately 75 percent, as in the
   formation go-around, and slowly and smoothly establish the missed approach pitch attitude.
   Use the radio to direct gear and flap retraction. Ensure the minimum climb gradient is
   maintained. Radio calls to number 2, stating current aircraft attitudes, can help avoid spatial
   disorientation.

Section 9I—Abnormal Procedures

9.52. Introduction. Ultimately, each crew must deal with abnormal procedures within his or
her own cockpit. Other formation members can either complicate situations or provide valuable
mutual support. The key to dealing with abnormal situations is to maximize the positive aspects
of formation without letting the distractions hinder successful recovery.
9.53. Formation Takeoff Abnormalities:
   9.53.1. Number 2 Passing Number 1. It may be difficult for number 2 to determine if
   number 1 is experiencing a problem (loss of power, etc.) that requires an abort. If number 2
   overruns number 1, number 2 selects MAX power and makes a separate takeoff while
   maintaining their side of the RWY. Follow number 1‘s directions.
   9.53.2. Number 2 Falling Behind Number 1. If number 2 falls behind on takeoff, number
   2 may not have sufficient airspeed to rotate with number 1. In this case, number 2 cross-
   checks engine instruments and the airspeed indicator, and aborts (if there is a problem) or
   performs a separate takeoff. For a separate takeoff, number 2 assumes proper formation
   position after becoming safely airborne.
   9.53.3. Formation Takeoff Abort (One Aircraft). If an abort becomes necessary, maintain
   aircraft control, ensure separation from the other aircraft (maintain the respective side of the
   RWY), and make a radio call as soon as practical (“Texan 2 aborting”). During an abort
   situation, the aircraft continuing the takeoff maintains its side of the RWY and executes a
   normal single-ship takeoff in max power.
   9.53.4. Interval Takeoff Abort. If number 1 aborts, make a radio call when practical. It
   may be difficult for number 2 to recognize an abort using only visual cues. If number 2 has
   not released brakes, number 2 reduces power and holds position until number 1 clears the
   RWY. If number 2 is rolling but below abort speed, an abort should be considered as there
   may not be sufficient spacing to takeoff behind number 1. If number 2 is above abort speed,
   continue the takeoff.
   9.53.5. Element Abort. During a formation takeoff, there are normally no sympathetic
   aborts after brake release. Sympathetic aborts can create situations in which the good aircraft
   risks making the situation worse by adding another aircraft into the high-speed abort situation
   when risk of collision, hot brakes, or blown tires increases. If it is necessary for the formation
   to abort, each aircraft must maintain its respective side of the RWY and make every effort to
   stop prior to the end of the RWY. Number 1 directs a formation abort with a radio call
   (“Texan Flight: abort, abort, abort!”). The operative word ―flight‖ indicates both aircraft
   should abort.
9.54. Airborne Emergencies (General). Maintain formation integrity to the maximum extent
possible during airborne emergencies. Mutual support is one of the primary reasons for
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                        229


formation flight. If either member of the formation must return to the airfield prematurely, the
other aircraft should normally return and provide assistance. The FL may make exceptions if the
problem is minor and the field is in sight, or if the WX conditions would complicate a safe
formation return. If an aircraft malfunction occurs while in fingertip, increase aircraft separation
before handling the emergency, if WX allows. The formation member with an abnormal
situation advises other members in the formation of the problem, intentions, and assistance
required. In VMC, without engine problems, the emergency aircraft generally leads back to a
straight-in. In IMC, the emergency aircraft generally leads back to an instrument approach.
Modify as appropriate based on the type of problem (for example, a PEL may be the best
recovery option).
   9.54.1. Number 1. When a malfunction is discovered, call KIO and inform number 2 of the
   problem as soon as practical. In general, the aircraft with a malfunction should be given the
   number 1 position. This allows the affected aircraft to handle the emergency without the
   requirement to maintain position. The number 1 position should be offered three times: (1)
   when the emergency occurs, (2) on recovery when below the WX and able to navigate VFR
   to the field, and (3) when on final with the field in sight. Except in IMC, avoid flying closer
   than route formation as number 2. If number 2 refuses the number 1 position at any time,
   offer it at each successive point as described above. Except in very unusual circumstances, do
   not attempt to land in formation with a disabled aircraft.
   9.54.2. Number 2. When a malfunction is discovered, call KIO, and inform number 1 of the
   problem as soon as practical. Normally, take the number 1 position when offered if able to
   communicate and navigate. Generally, avoid flying in the number 2 position with an
   emergency. If the situation dictates flying as number 2, avoid flying closer than route spacing
   when possible.
9.55. Engine Problems. With engine problems, the emergency aircraft leads back to an ELP. If
WX or field conditions at the intended recovery RWY are unknown, the good aircraft may be
sent ahead to report on airfield conditions and radio back to the emergency aircraft.
9.56. Physiological Incident. The bad aircraft typically leads back. The unaffected formation
member uses caution and good judgment, especially if penetration of IMC is required.
9.57. Bird Strike. If a bird strike appears imminent, do not attempt evasive maneuvers into the
other aircraft in an effort to miss the bird. The primary concern is midair collision avoidance and
aircraft separation. If a bird strike does occur, ensure aircraft separation before handling the
emergency. Consider executing a wing landing if forward visibility is severely restricted.
9.58. Midair Collision. If a midair collision occurs between formation members, they will not
act as chase ships for each other. Number 1 coordinates separate clearances and chase ships.
9.59. Spatial Disorientation:
   9.59.1. Number 1. If suffering from spatial disorientation, immediately tell number 2, and
   transfer aircraft control to the other pilot if practical. If transfer of aircraft control is not an
   option, confirm attitude with the other crewmember or number 2. If symptoms persist,
   terminate the mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   9.59.2. Number 2. If suffering from spatial disorientation, immediately tell number 1, and
   transfer aircraft control to the other pilot if practical. Number 1 advises number 2 of aircraft
 230                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, number 1
   should establish straight-and-level flight for 30 to 60 seconds. If possible, number 1 may try
   to get the formation to VMC conditions. If the condition persists, consider offering the
   number 1 position. If unable to maintain position, and number 2 becomes a threat to number
   1, a lost wingman should be initiated. As number 2, be cautious when initiating lost wingman
   procedures as this could trigger further spatial disorientation. If necessary, terminate the
   mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
9.60. Aircraft Strobe Lights. At times, number 1‘s strobe lights may distract number 2, which
could lead to spatial disorientation. Number 2 advises number 1 if the strobes are a hazard and
number 1 turns them off.
9.61. Icing. If number 2 experiences icing, notify number 1. Number 1 climbs or descends to
avoid cruising in icing conditions.
9.62. NORDO:
   9.62.1. When a member of the formation has total radio failure, the NORDO aircraft
   normally receives or retains number 2 position. The flight member with the operative radio
   leads the NORDO aircraft into the overhead pattern, notifies the RSU or tower, and makes a
   low approach to the landing RWY. The NORDO aircraft flies a normal pattern and landing.
   If WX prevents an overhead pattern, execute a straight-in or instrument approach as
   appropriate for the WX. When number 1 clears number 2 off with a visual signal, number 2
   assumes landing clearance and lands normally.
   9.62.2. With total radio failure while in fingertip, number 2 should maneuver to route, attract
   the attention of number 1, and give the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as
   soon as practical, and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing.
   9.62.3. If in other than fingertip or route when radio failure occurs and a rejoin is not
   anticipated, the NORDO aircraft should cautiously attempt to rejoin (no closer than route).
   Rock wings (attention in the air) and move no closer than route until directed. Once joined,
   the NORDO aircraft gives the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as soon as
   practical, and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing.
   9.62.4. If diversion is necessary with a NORDO aircraft, number 1 shows the pink pages in
   the in-flight guide followed by the number of the diversion base. Number 2 repeats the
   number to signal understanding.
9.63. Ejection. If ejection is required, the other aircraft acts as the on-scene commander until
relieved or bingo fuel is reached. Local in-flight guides will outline local specifics.

Section 9J—Fluid Maneuvering (approved for 80th Fighter Training Wing [FTW] only)

9.64. Fluid Maneuvering:
   9.64.1. Introduction. Fluid Maneuvering (FM) is intended to develop the advanced skills
   required to maneuver in relation to another aircraft. These skills include solving range,
   closure and AA problems using pursuit curves (lead, lag and pure) and turning room (out of
   plane maneuvering). Student pilots (SPs) will only fly FM levels 1 and 2 following
   demonstrations from an instructor pilot (IP). Pilot instructor training (PIT) qualified IPs will
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               231


  fly FM levels 3 and 4 with PIT trainees. FM serves as a building block, introducing concepts
  and skills required during advanced formation maneuvering training.
  9.64.2. Objectives:
     9.64.2.1. Introduce and practice recognizing and solving problems of range, closure, and
     AA by momentarily stabilizing in the goal position. The goal position is defined as the
     front edge of the fighting wing cone: specifically, 500 feet from number 1, 40 degrees
     AA (4 AA, rejoin line), and zero heading crossing angle (fuselages aligned). The number
     1 aircraft should fly a somewhat cooperative training platform, but like extended trail,
     increase difficulty as number 2‘s proficiency allows.
     9.64.2.2. Introduce and practice the administrative set-ups, terminations, and resets for
     advanced maneuvering.
     9.64.2.3. Introduce and practice the application of air-to-air training rules during
     advanced maneuvering.
     9.64.2.4. For the lead aircraft, practice setting and controlling the briefed training
     parameters.
     9.64.2.5. For PIT trainees, develop skills in FM levels 3 and 4 that will aid in safely
     resolving unexpected high closure and/or high aspect situations.
     9.64.2.6. Parameters: As number 2, work in a position aft of number 1‘s 3/9 line with
     between 500 and 1,500 feet of range.
  9.64.3. Training Rules for Fluid Maneuvering:
     9.64.3.1. 300 Foot Bubble. Under no circumstances will number 2 maneuver closer
     than 300 feet. Call ―knock it off‖ if a bubble violation occurs or is imminent.
     9.64.3.2. 3/9 Line. Maximum AA is 9 AA (3/9 Line). Call ―knock it off‖ if number 2
     exceeds 9 AA. Number 1 shares responsibility for this restriction and should control bank
     angle/turn rate to ensure number 2 remains aft of the 3/9 line.
     9.64.3.3. Reversing Direction of Turn. During FM levels 3 and 4, a reversal by
     number 1 is scripted to generate range/closure/aspect problems. Number 1 must have
     situational awareness on number 2‘s position or may reverse at the request of number 2.
     These directional changes should be commensurate with number 2‘s proficiency and are
     not intended to force a bubble or 3/9 violation.
     9.64.3.4. Fluid Maneuvering. Limited to two-ship formations.
  9.64.4. Preparation, Entry and Termination of Exercise:
     9.64.4.1. Preparation. Fluid Maneuvering will be entered from tactical or a pitchout.
     Number 1 will prepare the flight for fluid maneuvering with a radio call (“Texan,
     Standby FM [Level 1/Level 2/Level 3/Level 4]).” Number 2 will respond with ―2‖ and
     use this time to refine formation position and complete any required in-flight checks.
     Number 1 will transmit “Texan 1 Ready,” and number 2 will respond with “Texan 2
     ready,” or “Texan 2, standby (reason).‖
     9.64.4.2. Entry from Tactical. Direct the flight to gain setup spacing and aspect with a
     radio call (“Texan, check left/right”). Use an approximately 40-degree check turn away
232                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


      from number 2. After the turn is complete, execute a turn opposite the direction of the
      check turn using 30 to 45 degrees of bank and power, as required to maintain energy.
      Number 2 will maneuver to achieve proper spacing (1,500) and aspect (3 to 4 AA), and
      call “Texan 2, 1500.” Number 1 will begin maneuvering using the appropriate FM level
      parameters.
      9.64.4.3. Entry from a Pitchout. After the preparatory communications, number 1 will
      use a pitchout maneuver and roll out at approximately 180 degrees of heading change (or
      as required for airspace management). Number 2 will delay the turn as required to create
      proper spacing (approximately 5 seconds). Play the turn to roll out approximately 2,500
      feet at number 1‘s 6 o‘clock. Number 1 will make the ―ready‖ call and after number 2
      acknowledges, number 1 will begin a turn in either direction using approximately 30 to
      45 degrees of bank and power, as required to maintain energy. Number 2 will maneuver
      to achieve proper spacing (1,500 feet) and aspect (3 to 4 AA), and call “Texan 2, 1500.”
      Number 1 will begin maneuvering using the appropriate FM level parameters.
      9.64.4.4. Terminating the Exercise. Number 2 will normally terminate the exercise
      when the desired learning objectives (DLOs) have been met. Number 1 may direct the
      wingman to a new formation position. If number 1 does not direct a new formation,
      maintain fighting wing until directed otherwise. Perform a fuel and G check between
      each set of FM.
  9.64.5. FM Level 1. FM Level 1 uses a building-block approach to practice the basic
  concepts of lead, lag, and pure pursuit.
      9.64.5.1. Number 1. During the exercise, number 1 will maintain 70 to 85 percent
      torque, 180 to 220 KIAS, 45 to 60 degrees AOB, up to approximately 2 Gs, and plus or
      minus 10 degrees pitch.
      9.64.5.2. Number 2. Number 2 will use lead, lag and pure pursuit to fly the aircraft
      from 3 to 4 AA and 1,500 feet range to the goal position. To accomplish this, number 2
      will need to modulate power and G while using three-dimensional maneuvering to solve
      closure and angle problems. Upon reaching the goal position, or when DLOs are attained,
      number 2 may terminate the exercise.
  9.64.6. FM Level 2. FM Level 2 will demonstrate the principles learned above while
  number 1 maneuvers through a greater range of pitch and airspeed variations.
      9.64.6.1. Number 1. During the exercise, number 1 will maintain 85 percent to MAX
      torque, 150 to 250 KIAS, up to approximately 120 degrees AOB, and approximately 2 to
      4 Gs. Maneuver in the vertical to allow airspeed to vary between 150 and 250 knots while
      limiting pitch changes to ± 30 degrees from the horizon.
      9.64.6.2. Number 2. Demonstrate understanding of the pursuit curves and closure
      control. Momentarily establish the aircraft in the goal position. Once established, move
      out again to explore the envelope. Repeat this until training objectives are met. Number 2
      will terminate the exercise once DLOs have been met.
  9.64.7. FM Level 3. FM Level 3 will entail three passes flown while number 1 holds FM 1
  parameters. The passes are normally flown in order (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie), with a
  reposition to approximately 2,500 feet between each exercise.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                  233


     9.64.7.1. Number 1. Number 1 will set 70 to 85 percent torque, 180 to 220 KIAS,
     approximately 2 Gs, 45 to 60 degrees AOB, and +/- 10 degrees pitch. As Number 2
     repositions out of plane on pass Bravo, Number 1 reverses the direction of turn in order
     to give Number 2 a developing closure problem. Number 1 must remain aware of number
     2‘s position throughout the maneuver.
     9.64.7.2. Number 2. Number 2 will execute passes Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie as
     described in paragraphs 9.64.7.2.1, 9.64.7.2.2, and 9.64.7.2.3. Number 2 will call ―in‖
     passing approximately 4 AA, with approximately 2,000 to 2,500 feet separation from
     number 1 between each exercise to indicate the beginning of the next pass.
         9.64.7.2.1. FM 3 Pass Alpha. The first pass will show the effects of lead pursuit on
         AA, angle off, and closure. Using the principles of a low yo-yo, exaggerate lead
         pursuit to maneuver toward 9 AA. Using power as required, descending low in
         relation to number 1‘s plane of motion, and using lead pursuit will increase closure on
         number 1. As closure develops with lead pursuit, the AA will increase and range will
         decrease. Maneuver as necessary to maintain 9 AA while avoiding a 3/9 violation.
         Approaching 500 feet, maneuver out of plane from number 1 toward the high six
         o‘clock position. This may result in briefly losing sight of number 1 as the flight path
         crosses high to the outside of number 1‘s turn circle. Crossing the turn circle, proceed
         above number 1‘s plane of motion, bank back toward the direction of turn to regain
         visual and realign fuselages. A lag roll may be used to maintain sight throughout the
         reposition. Remain slightly outside number 1‘s turn to reestablish 2,500 feet of
         separation.
         9.64.7.2.2. FM 3 Pass Bravo. The second pass will show the use of lag pursuit to
         control AA and closure. Use the low yo-yo to increase aspect toward a 9 AA. At
         approximately 1,000 feet from number 1, use lag to decrease AA. As the AA
         decreases, angle off will increase and a maneuver toward lead pursuit will align
         fuselages. Plan the maneuver to attain a 6 AA prior to reaching a range of 500 feet.
         The 6 AA is achieved when the leading edge of the tail is approximately aligned with
         the opposite wingtip. Again, maneuver out of plane from number 1 to reestablish
         separation. When crossing number 1‘s 6 o‘clock, exaggerate the flight path overshoot
         with increased angle off. Number 1 will reverse the direction of turn, increasing
         closure and aspect. To control closure and complete the reposition, maneuver to
         number 1‘s new high 6 o‘clock. Reestablish 2,500 feet of separation.
         9.64.7.2.3. FM 3 Pass Charlie. The third pass will build on the lessons of the initial
         demonstrations. Pull lead and allow the AA to increase toward a 9 AA. At
         approximately 1,200 to 1,000 feet, begin using lead and lag pursuit to control AA and
         angle off. Plan to fly to a stabilized position 500 feet from number 1 with
         approximately a 4 AA with fuselages aligned. A 4 AA reference is the vertical tail on
         or inside the wingtip. Approaching the stabilized position, modulate power to help
         control closure. Varying G during maneuvering will also help to control energy.
  9.64.8. FM Level 4. FM Level 4 should be flown only after a trainee has received in-flight
  instruction for FM 3 and FM 4. Demonstrate understanding of the aforementioned principles
  while number 1 maneuvers through a greater range of pitch and airspeed variations.
 234                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


       9.64.8.1. Number 1. During the exercise, number 1 will maintain 85 percent to MAX
       torque, 150 to 250 KIAS, up to approximately 120 degrees AOB, and approximately 2 to
       4 Gs. Maneuver in the vertical to allow airspeed to vary between 150 and 250 knots while
       limiting pitch changes to ± 30 degrees from the horizon. Number 1 should reverse the
       direction of turn several times to create closure and angle problems.
       9.64.8.2. Number 2. Demonstrate understanding of pursuit curves and closure control.
       Momentarily establish the aircraft in the goal position. Maneuver in a safe direction when
       number 1 reverses the direction of turn. Once momentarily established in a stabilized
       position, move out again to explore the envelope. Repeat until training objectives are met.

Section 9K—Formation Low Level (approved for 80FTW only)

9.65. Two-Ship Low-Level Navigation:
   9.65.1. Introduction. A successful two-ship, low-level navigation mission will require a
   combination of solid low-level navigation practices, formation skills, and discipline. The goal
   of low-level two-ship navigation is to maneuver the formation safely through a selected
   ground track, while avoiding threats, to arrive at a designated time over target.
   9.65.2. Preflight planning. Preflight planning for a two-ship, low-level mission is generally
   more involved than a single ship low-level or a standard formation mission. The major
   addition in the planning process is that the turn points and ground track may need to be
   altered to ensure the formation stays in the corridor, avoids obstacles, and can adjust for
   significant terrain changes. Extra time should be spent during the route study and briefing
   phases to ensure all formation members are aware of where the wingman should fly to
   comply with the considerations above.
   9.65.3. Formation Types and Procedures:
       9.65.3.1. Tactical Line Abreast. When flying low over relatively level terrain, tactical
       line abreast formation works well. Tactical line abreast provides an excellent formation
       for clearing in a high threat environment. However, it is less flexible and requires a
       greater degree of planning. The tactical line abreast parameters described in Section 9G
       should be used, but the wingman will stack no lower than lead.
       9.65.3.2. Wedge. The wedge parameters in Section 9G should be used, but utilize
       wedge formation when terrain, bird condition, or maneuvering require an increased
       degree of flexibility and clearing. Again, the wingman will stack no lower than lead.
       Turns do not need to be called over the radio.
       9.65.3.3. Fighting Wing. When aggressive maneuvering is required, fighting wing may
       be flown. Fighting wing offers a great deal of flexibility, but does not maximize the
       wingman‘s ability to clear for the formation. The fighting wing parameters described in
       Section 9D should be used, but the wingman will stack no lower than lead.
   9.65.4. Departure. In addition to managing normal formation responsibilities, navigation to
   the start point and accomplishment of all other low-level entry requirements for the particular
   navigation route increase the challenge of two-ship low level. To enhance clearing and
   increase the formation‘s maneuverability, spread the wingman to route, fighting wing, or a
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      235


  tactical formation as soon as possible after takeoff. Unless WX or other procedures dictate,
  maintain a clearing formation to the route entry.
  9.65.5. Route Entry. If not already accomplished, lead will put the wingman in fighting
  wing, wedge, or another formation suitable for visual lookout and maneuverability prior to
  route entry. In a relatively short span of time, lead must call entering the route, locate the
  entry point, maneuver the formation as necessary for course alignment, call the time hack
  over the radio, and accelerate to the planned airspeed. Prior planning and solid SA are
  imperative for a smooth entry into the low-level structure.
  9.65.6. Low-Level Lead Change. Accomplish the lead change according to AFI 11-2T-6,
  Volume 3. Initiate the lead change over the radio from tactical formation.
  9.65.7. Initial Point to Target Run:
     9.65.7.1. Target Run. Number 1 will direct number 2 to wedge or fighting wing prior to
     the initial point to target run. Number 2 will maintain the directed position and all
     members of the flight will overfly the target in level flight.
     9.65.7.2. Target Egress. The flight lead will plan and brief a method for achieving a
     designated tactical formation (preferably line abreast) off the target. An example would
     be a preplanned turn by number 2 to an egress heading, and a lead ground track that
     would bring number 2 forward to line abreast.
  9.65.8. Responsibilities:
     9.65.8.1. Number 1:
         9.65.8.1.1. Visual Lookout. Find, call out, and avoid any traffic or birds that could
         be a factor to the formation. Climb the formation in sufficient time to avoid all
         obstacles within 2 NM of planned ground track unless able to visually acquire and
         ensure lateral separation from obstacles along the flight path of the entire formation.
         Avoid conflicts and potential mid-air collision situations with the wingman. TAS may
         help to focus the visual lookout and provide additional SA on traffic outside the
         formation.
         9.65.8.1.2. Navigate and Lead. Use single-ship low-level route and timing
         corrections to fly the route, identify all turn points, and be in a position to arrive at the
         target on time. In addition to single-ship techniques, formation check turns, tactical
         turns, and shackles may be incorporated. Climb the formation for all avoidance areas
         the flight will penetrate. Accomplish all turns as briefed and, unless called otherwise,
         roll out of each turn on the heading for the next leg.
         9.65.8.1.3. Maintain SA on Number 2. Direct formation adjustments as necessary,
         and stay aware of number 2‘s fuel state. Initiate ops checks at appropriate intervals
         (every 10 minutes or every other leg, as a minimum).
         9.65.8.1.4. Communications. Use standard brevity code in referring to objects or
         positions on the ground. Unless lead briefs otherwise, formations use the following
         plan to communicate whether or not obstacles are in sight: The flight member
         sighting the obstacle transmits his or her call sign and the clock position of the
         obstacle relative to the nose of one of the other flight members (“Texan 2, tower, 1
236                                                         AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


          o’clock 4 miles”). The other flight member acknowledges (“Texan 1, contact,” or
          “Texan 1, negative contact.”).
      9.65.8.2. Number 2:
          9.65.8.2.1. Visual Lookout. Find, call out, and avoid traffic or birds that could
          affect the formation. Avoid conflicts and potential mid-air collision situations with
          lead.
          9.65.8.2.2. Be in Position or Correcting. Always strive for the briefed formation
          position unless turn requirements or safety dictates otherwise. In tactical line abreast
          and wedge, stack level to slightly high. At 500 feet AGL, lead will be on the horizon
          to very slightly below the horizon when you are stacked level at 2,500 feet laterally.
          Whenever a flight path conflict with lead exists, cross high in relation to lead.
          9.65.8.2.3. Maintain SA. Strive to maintain sufficient positional awareness on
          navigation, route, and timing so you know when to expect key events such as turns,
          climbs, and position changes. Unless called otherwise, roll out of each turn on the
          planned heading for the next leg. Strive to maintain enough SA to confidently assume
          the lead if necessary.
  9.65.9. Two-Ship Low-Level Maneuvering:
      9.65.9.1. Contract Turn. Plan and fly turns at low altitude using MAX power and 2 to
      3 Gs to hold planned indicated airspeed. This should equate to approximately 70 degrees
      of bank. It is critical that each pilot ensure the aircraft is not descending in the turn as any
      over-bank or incipient sink could result in impact with the terrain. For comm-out turns, a
      zipper click will assist the wingman in preparation for the turn and deconfliction from
      number 1.
      9.65.9.2. Low-Level Turns as Number 1:
          9.65.9.2.1. Number 2 on the Inside of the Turn. Begin the contract turn over the
          planned turn point to keep the aircraft on the planned ground track. Unless briefed
          otherwise, number 2 should climb to deconflict flight paths, if necessary.
          9.65.9.2.2. Number 2 on the Outside of the Turn. From tactical line abreast, start
          number 2 turning early enough to allow a delay of turn until right over the planned
          turn point. For a 90- or 45-degree turn, use the same references described in Section
          9G. For a turn of greater than 90 degrees, turn sooner than the 90-degree turn
          reference.
          9.65.9.2.3. Turns of 30 Degrees or Less. Normally, simply turn to the new heading;
          a delayed turn is not necessary. For a planned check turn into the wingman, to the
          wingman should drop back closer to the 30-degree line before the turn. It will always
          be number 1‘s option to direct an unplanned check or tactical turn.
      9.65.9.3. Low-Level Turns as Number 2:
          9.65.9.3.1. On the Inside of the Turn. Delay the turn until number 1 has turned an
          appropriate number of degrees to allow you to complete the turn in the proper tactical
          position. For a 90- or 45-degree turn, use the same references described in Section
          9G.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                 237


        9.65.9.3.2. On the Outside of the Turn. Anticipate the turn and the call or signal
        from number 1. Have the rollout heading in mind, execute a contract turn, and climb
        to deconflict if necessary.
  9.65.10. Contingencies:
     9.65.10.1. Lost Sight Situations:
        9.65.10.1.1. When Number 2 Loses Sight. During low-level tactical turns, a
        momentary blind situation is normal. This is acceptable as long as sight of lead is
        regained at an appropriate time. If not regained or if sight of number 1 is
        unexpectedly lost at any other time, transmit call sign along with ―blind.‖ Maintain
        current heading and climb to 1,000 feet AGL or as briefed to help ensure
        deconfliction and terrain clearance while searching for lead. Once visual with number
        1, call ―visual‖ and continue the mission. If unable to regain sight of lead after the
        climb, continue to ensure terrain clearance and follow number 1‘s instructions.
        9.65.10.1.2. Number 1’s Actions When Number 2 Loses Sight:
            9.65.10.1.2.1. If number 2 calls blind but number 1 is visual, start a climb to
            1,000 feet AGL and transmit call sign, the word ―visual,‖ and relative position.
            Once number 2 visually acquires number 1, descend back to 500‘ AGL.
            9.65.10.1.2.2. If number 2 remains blind, direct an appropriate altitude and
            heading. Consider a wing rock to aid in visual acquisition. If necessary, initiate a
            modified rejoin to no closer than 500 feet from number 2 while continuing to give
            relative position. Once number 2 is visual, direct an appropriate formation
            position and continue the route if conditions and corridor boundaries allow.
        9.65.10.1.3. Double-Blind Situation (Both Aircraft Lose Sight):
            9.65.10.1.3.1. If number 2 calls ―blind‖ and you, as number 1, do not have him in
            sight, maintain your current heading and altitude. Direct number 2 to maintain the
            same heading and begin a climb to 1,500 feet AGL. Once altitude deconfliction
            assured, number 1 climbs to 1,000 feet AGL.
            9.65.10.1.3.2. If both aircraft regain sight of each other in the climb, number 1
            may direct the formation to descend back to 500 feet AGL and continue the
            mission. If number 1 visually acquires number 2 in the climb, both aircraft will
            follow the procedures in paragraph 9.65.10.1.2. If neither aircraft regains sight,
            both will continue to the next turn point while maintaining altitude deconfliction,
            using landmarks along the route to try to find each other. When arriving at the
            next turn point, if still not visually acquired, number 1 will be directive. Do not
            continue the route as a formation.
            9.65.10.1.3.3. Remain aware of fuel remaining, other aircraft scheduled on the
            low-level, and how much time can be spent attempting to get back together. Relay
            position to number 2 using a timing reference or landmark along the route.
            9.65.10.1.3.4. Normally, both formation members will abort the low-level route.
            Do not reenter the MTR after aborting. If still unable to regain sight of each other
            with altitude deconfliction during the abort, accomplish single-ship recoveries.
            During single-ship recoveries, ensure altitude separation from the wingman until
238                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


            confirming radar contact with a controlling agency.
      9.65.10.2. Radio Failure:
         9.65.10.2.1. Number 1 Loses Radio. If radio failure is confirmed or suspected,
         climb to a minimum of 1,000 feet AGL and initiate a rejoin. Once rejoined, give the
         appropriate AFI 11-205 visual signals and follow the briefed no radio (NORDO)
         procedures.
         9.65.10.2.2. Number 2 Loses Radio. If radio failure is confirmed or suspected,
         climb to 1,000 feet AGL and rock the aircraft‘s wings to get lead‘s attention. Do not
         sacrifice aircraft control in an attempt to gain lead‘s attention and do not close to
         within 500 feet of lead until given the proper signal. Once rejoined, give the
         appropriate AFI 11-205 visual signals for the situation and comply with the briefed
         NORDO procedures.
      9.65.10.3. IMC Route Abort:
         9.65.10.3.1. Number 1’s Actions:
            9.65.10.3.1.1. When possible, avoid IMC by climbing or turning. Use an in-place
            turn if necessary. If IMC penetration is imminent, attempt to rejoin number 2
            while maintaining VMC. If unable to maintain VMC until the rejoin is complete,
            ensure the flight initiates a wings-level climb on course to the route abort altitude
            (RAA) as a minimum with the briefed altitude separation.
            9.65.10.3.1.2. Ensure number 2 is flying parallel to number 1‘s heading and
            squawk ―emergency‖ on the transponder as soon as practical. To lessen the
            chances of a midair collision with number 2, do not turn while in IMC.
            9.65.10.3.1.3. If unable to reach VMC above the RAA, ensure altitude separation
            with number 2 and attempt to contact a radar facility. If unable to contact a radar
            facility, climb to a higher altitude while continuing to ensure altitude separation.
            Maintain the climb and squawk ―emergency‖ until reaching VMC or contacting a
            radar facility.
         9.65.10.3.2. Number 2’s Actions. When directed, rejoin as expeditiously as
         possible without becoming a hazard to the formation. If unable to rejoin prior to
         entering IMC, make a minimum heading change of 10 degrees away from number 1
         until altitude separation is ensured. Parallel number 1's heading and follow
         instructions. Turn on NACWS/TAS for additional assistance in deconfliction.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                       239


                                            Chapter 10

                                        NIGHT FLYING

10.1. Introduction. The techniques and procedures for night flying are basically the same as
for day flying, but vigilance must be increased, mostly due to visibility restrictions. The
reduction in visibility hampers the ability to see inside the cockpit (checklists, instruments, etc.)
and outside the cockpit (horizon, landmarks, etc.). These limitations can cause frustration and
discomfort, but practice and use of basic night flying techniques aid in adaptation to the night
environment in the T-6 and follow-on aircraft.
10.2. Briefing. Emphasize visibility restrictions. Include a discussion of night considerations,
foreground operations, taxi, takeoff, spatial disorientation, arrival (instrument approach or
overhead), landing, and abnormal procedures.
10.3. Night Flying Techniques:
   10.3.1. Ensure all transparencies are clean. Make certain ground personnel remove spots and
   dirt on the windshield.. Scratches and dirt cause reflections and can be disorienting during
   night ops.
   10.3.2. During ground ops, ensure all required exterior and interior lights are operational.
   10.3.3. Keep cockpit lights turned down to a comfortable level. As vision adapts to night
   conditions, turn lights down to the lowest possible level that still allows instruments to be
   easily read. This is especially important in the traffic pattern as canopy glare from
   excessively bright interior lights can seriously restrict visibility.
   10.3.4. Know the location of all important switches and control levers by touch. Use caution
   to prevent operation of the wrong switch in a dim or dark cockpit.
   10.3.5. Always carry an operable flashlight. With electrical failure, a flashlight may be the
   only means of checking STBY instruments, checklists, and maps. Store the flashlight in a
   readily accessible place.
   10.3.6. The T-6 lighting system consists of red and white lights for the cockpit and
   instrument panel. These lights can be adjusted for intensity and are used separately or in
   combination to optimize cockpit lighting. To avoid eyestrain and keep canopy reflections to a
   minimum, adjust instrument lights to the minimum level necessary. As eyes adapt to the
   dark, even a momentary glance at a bright light can destroy this adaptation. It can be difficult
   to distinguish objects outside the cockpit until the eyes readapt.
10.4. Inspections and Checks. Cockpit organization is more important at night. The
instruments may not generate enough light to see items in a G suit hold-down strap or kneeboard.
The glare shield finger lights (if installed) can be manipulated, or the utility light may be placed
on the right canopy rail for increased lighting in the cockpit. It is important for night adaptation
to keep the intensity of the interior light as low as practical to prevent degrading night vision and
to minimize the possibility of spatial disorientation.
10.5. Taxiing. Review the airfield diagram before taxiing. Form a good mental picture of the
taxi route to the RWY. Pilots have made wrong turns on strange fields at night. Taxi at slower
speeds due to reduced visibility. Use a minimum of 300 feet spacing and taxi on the taxiway
 240                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


centerline. When taxiing toward a landing RWY, taxi and landing lights can interfere with the
vision of pilots landing or taking off. It is common to extinguish the taxi and landing lights while
awaiting takeoff. Always stop if an area cannot be visually cleared or there is any doubt about
the safety of continued taxi.
10.6. Takeoff. Line up on the centerline of the RWY and perform a static run-up. After brake
release, look down the RWY. Avoid fixation to one side (at the RWY lights). Immediately after
takeoff there may be a tendency to pitch over due to lack of forward lighting and a desire for
forward visibility. Do not hesitate to use ITO procedures if visual references are poor. Ensure a
positive climb before retracting the gear.
10.7. Optical Illusions. Misinterpretation of the altimeter at night may cause accidents. Careful
interpretation of the altimeter is absolutely necessary for safe flight at night as actual height
above the ground is difficult to confirm visually. Compensate for lack of visual references at
night by using a reduced descent rate or by calling out altitudes when descending close to the
ground. At altitude, the ability to see distant objects, such as lights, is typically much better at
night than in the day. The ability to see lights at great distances causes several problems with
judging distances. A bright light on the ground can be seen as a star if far enough away.
Conversely, bright stars can often be mistaken for lights on the ground, especially in sparsely
populated areas. Lights displayed by other aircraft are usually easy to detect, but direction of
flight, distance, and closure rate are difficult to determine. Navigation and strobe lights can help
determine the direction of flight of other aircraft.
10.8. Spatial Disorientation. Pilots are much more susceptible to spatial disorientation at night
than during the day. See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, and paragraph 7.18 in this manual for
detailed information on causes and hazards of spatial disorientation.
10.9. Area Orientation. Use contact (visual) and instrument procedures and/or techniques for
area orientation at night. Prominent landmarks, cities, or towns can sometimes be seen at night,
especially with high moon illumination. Review local hazards and minimum safe altitudes before
night flying.
10.10. Unusual Attitudes. Unusual attitudes are generally caused by a loss of SA but can also
be caused by WX phenomena. Use instrument unusual attitude recovery procedures to recover
from unusual attitudes at night.
10.11. Night VFR. Night VFR flight uses a combination of instrument and visual references
and procedures. The degree of darkness and horizon clarity determine the ratio of attention given
to flight instruments and outside references. On bright moonlit nights, it may be possible to fly
visually with only occasional glances at the instruments to confirm visual references. On dark
nights, with little or no horizon, the instruments are the primary reference, and available visual
references are used to cross-check aircraft position. After takeoff, gradually transition from
instruments to outside references when above 500 feet AGL.
   10.11.1. Reduced ability to see at night creates other hazards. Clouds can be difficult or even
   impossible to see. Flying into a cloud at night can be surprising and very disorienting. After
   inadvertent flight into clouds at night, quickly transition to instruments to minimize
   disorientation. If strobes cause disorientation when in the WX, it is acceptable to turn them
   off.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                      241


   10.11.2. During darkness, an unlit landmark may be difficult or impossible to see. Lighted
   landmarks can be confusing because of optical illusions; large cities can often be recognized
   by their shapes. Many small towns are dark at night and make poor references. Highways,
   which are usually discernible at night due to automobile headlights and airfield rotating
   beacons, which can be seen up to 100 miles away, make useful visual navigation points.
10.12. Night Overhead Patterns. At night the traffic pattern is unchanged. Ground references
are more difficult to see, and although it is easy to see other aircraft, distance can be harder to
judge. A common practice is to verify final turn pitch with the EADI. A normal ―2/3 ground, 1/3
sky‖ picture is approximately 2 to 3 degrees NL.
10.13. Night Landings. When wings level on final, concentrate on the descent, and plan to
touch down within the first 1,000 feet of the RWY. Do not fixate on any single RWY reference
or stare at bright lights. Plan to touch down on centerline.
10.14. Abnormal Procedures. Procedures and techniques to handle emergency situations do
not change significantly, but limited visibility at night complicates every scenario. The reduction
in visual references may significantly reduce the ability to successfully accomplish an ELP,
especially if not at the home field, to the point that it may be eliminated as an option for aircraft
recovery altogether.

                                           Chapter 11

                        THREE- AND FOUR-SHIP FORMATIONS

11.1. Guidelines. Four-ship formation flying requires thorough planning and attention to detail
from preflight through postflight. All members of the formation will be briefed and thoroughly
familiar with the proposed profile and procedures. The basic formation positions, references,
techniques, and procedures described for a two-ship formation also apply to three- and four-ship
formations. Airspeed for rejoins will normally be 180 KIAS or as briefed.
11.2. Three-Ship Formation Briefing. Normally, you will not plan to fly a three-ship
formation. A three-ship formation is usually the result of a ground or takeoff abort by a member
of a four-ship formation. Brief a three-ship plan for all four ships.
11.3. Runway Lineup:
   11.3.1. Figure 11.1 depicts the RWY lineups for a four-ship takeoff. See AFI 11-2T-6,
   Volume 3, for RWY width restrictions for each lineup.

Figure 11.1. Four-Ship Runway Lineup.




   11.3.2. Normally, a formation will use the element lineup depiction. Place number 2 on the
   upwind side of the RWY just like a two-ship formation. If crosswinds are not a factor,
   number 1 will place the number 2 on the inside of the first turn out of traffic (Figure 11.2). If
   RWY length is not a factor, 500 feet of space between elements can also be used as an
   option.
   11.3.3. To establish the slot lineup, lead will be as far to the side of the RWY as practical.
   Number 2 will place the wingtip closest to lead on the centerline, ensuring a minimum of 35
   feet wingtip clearance. Number 3 will line up with 10 feet of wingtip clearance on number 2
   in echelon position (helmets of numbers 1 and 2 aligned). Number 4 will pull in between
   numbers 1 and 2 with wingtip clearance, aligning to the appropriate formation position on
   number 3. Number 4 will pull forward enough to see number 3‘s helmet before it is blocked
   by number 2‘s rudder. Number 4 will not run up power until numbers 1 and 2 roll.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                     243


Figure 11.2. Four-Ship Element Lineup.




11.4. Runups and Takeoffs:
   11.4.1. When all aircraft are in position, number 1 will direct the engine run-up, using the
   same run-up procedures as in a two-ship formation. During individual takeoffs, numbers 2, 3,
   and 4 may delay their run-up a few seconds.
   11.4.2. A three- and four-ship formation takeoff may be accomplished by single-ship
   takeoffs with individual rejoins out of traffic or by element takeoffs. Use 6-second
   (minimum) spacing between individual aircraft departures. Use 10-second (minimum)
   spacing between elements. However, if WX necessitates an element instrument trail
   departure, use spacing criteria specified in chapter 9 in combination with any local directives.
   Each aircraft maintains at least 1,000 feet of vertical separation from the preceding aircraft or
   element except where departure instructions specifically prevent compliance.
 244                                                        AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


11.5. Takeoff Aborts. Each aircraft must be prepared to react to any situation if a preceding
aircraft aborts. Options available are: (1) hold position, (2) abort, or (3) continue the takeoff as
safety dictates.
11.6. Rejoins (from Takeoff). The type of rejoin will depend on the local departure
procedures. It may consist of a turning rejoin, a straight ahead, or a combination of both.
Normally, for rejoins following element takeoffs, number 3 will send number 4 to a route
position with a minimum spacing of 100 feet prior to rejoining on the lead element. Number 4
will fly a position off number 3 and will monitor the lead element throughout the rejoin. During
the rejoin, number 3 must avoid sudden power changes and abrupt flight control inputs. Each
aircraft will maintain a minimum of 100 feet of separation until the preceding aircraft has
stabilized in route.
11.7. Turns (from Takeoff). Number 1 will start a turn and maintain briefed power and
airspeed until the formation is joined. Wingmen will begin the turn no earlier than the departure
end of the RWY. Following element takeoffs, number 1 will ensure number 2 is positioned on
the inside of the turn, allowing numbers 3 and 4 to join to the outside. If required, number 1 may
roll out and call for a straight-ahead rejoin.
11.8. Straight Ahead (From Takeoff). Number 1 will maintain briefed power and airspeed
until the formation is joined. Following element takeoffs, number 1 will ensure number 2 is
positioned on the left, allowing numbers 3 and 4 to join to the right side.
11.9. Formation Positions. The following positions are approached primarily from the
wingman‘s point of view:
   11.9.1. Fingertip. Determine number 4‘s position using the normal fingertip references
   relative to the number 3 aircraft. If number 3 is rough, number 4 should fly a stable position
   on number 1 and constantly monitor number 3‘s position (Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                              245


Figure 11.3. Four-Ship Fingertip Formation.




Figure 11.4. Four-Ship Fingertip Formation in a Turn.




   11.9.2. Echelon. Echelon is a variation of fingertip formation in which the second element
   aligns itself on the same side as number 2 or vice versa (Figure 11.5 and Figure 11.6).
 246                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 11.5. Four-Ship Echelon.




Figure 11.6. Four-Ship Echelon Turn.




       11.9.2.1. Number 1 will signal for echelon by dipping a wing in the desired direction. If
       number 1‘s wing dips toward number 2, that aircraft will hold position. Numbers 3 and 4
       will move back and down to provide adequate clearance from the lead element. Number
       3 (with number 4 on the wing) will then begin to cross to an echelon position on the wing
       of number 2, keeping safe clearances. As number 3 crosses behind number 1, number 4
       will cross under to the new position on the other wing of number 3 (Figure 11.7).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                               247


Figure 11.7. Echelon Crossunder for Numbers 3 and 4.




      11.9.2.2. If the echelon signal is given toward the side of the second element, number 3
      (with number 4 on the wing) will move out, back, and slightly down to make room for
      number 2. Number 2 will maintain position until the element has spread out. Once
      number 2 has determined the second element has made sufficient room, number 2 will
      execute a normal crossunder keeping the element in sight until moving forward on
      number 1. Numbers 3 and 4 will align themselves with number 2 and number 1. Smooth
      technique by numbers 2 and 3 will prevent a crack-the-whip on number 4 (Figure 11.8).
 248                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


Figure 11.8. Echelon Crossunder for Number 2.




       11.9.2.3. Except for very gentle turns into the echelon, always make turns away from the
       echelon. Number 3 will fly off number 2 and number 4 will fly off number 3, using
       normal echelon references.
11.10. Route. The purpose and parameters of a four-ship route are the same as for a two-ship
route. Due to the decreased maneuverability of a four-ship route, the wingman should favor the
extended fingertip line in level flight, and may maneuver behind the line to maintain spacing and
sight of lead.
11.11. Rejoins:
   11.11.1. Turning Rejoins:
       11.11.1.1. During four-ship turning rejoins, wingmen will relay the wing rocking signal
       to the aircraft behind them. Number 2 always joins to the inside of number 1‘s turn.
       Rejoin procedures for number 2 are identical to the procedures described in Chapter 9. If
       number 2 is slow to rejoin, it will complicate the rejoin for numbers 3 and 4, who will
       have to decrease airspeed and/or cutoff to maintain proper spacing on the preceding
       aircraft.
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                                    249


       11.11.1.2. Number 3 will always join to the outside of number 1‘s turn. The basic rejoin
       techniques used by number 3 are the same as those used by number 2. However, number
       3 has the additional responsibility of monitoring number 2 and remaining aware of
       number 4.
       11.11.1.3. Number 3 should establish an AA no greater than that used by number 2.
       Number 3 should accelerate to gain an airspeed advantage on number 1 and maintain a
       100-foot clearance (minimum) on the lead element until number 2 is stabilized in route.
       11.11.1.4. Number 3 should plan the rejoin to pass with a minimum of nose-tail
       separation behind and below the lead element as he or she moves to the outside of the
       turn, stabilizing in route, and slowly moving into fingertip position on number 1. Number
       3 will avoid abrupt control pressure and rapid throttle movements if number 4 has closed
       to minimum distance (approximately 100 feet).
       11.11.1.5. Number 4 will also always join to the outside of number 1‘s turn, and basic
       rejoin techniques will still apply. However, number 4 must monitor number 3 as well as
       the lead element during rejoin. After receiving the rejoin signal, number 4 will begin a
       turn to establish an AA no greater than number 3 or 2, while accelerating to gain airspeed
       advantage. As number 4, maintain this AA on the lead element and number 3, and plan
       your rejoin to pass with a minimum of nose-tail separation behind and below the first
       element and number 3 as you move to the outside of the turn. Stabilize in route and
       slowly move into fingertip position on number 3. Number 4 must monitor all aircraft in
       the formation as the rejoin progresses.
   11.11.2. Straight-Ahead Rejoins. After completing the pitchout, number 1 will signal for a
   rejoin by rocking the wings or making a radio call. Wingmen will pass along the wing-
   rocking signal to the aircraft behind them. Number 2 will rejoin to the left side unless
   otherwise directed. The second element will always join to the side opposite of number 2,
   and maintain a minimum of 100-foot clearance on number 3 until number 3 is stabilized in
   route.
11.12. Overshoot. As a member of a four-ship formation, you must recognize an overshoot
situation as soon as possible and make positive corrections. If an overshoot is appropriate, follow
previously established procedures. In addition, the following considerations apply based on your
position in the formation:
   11.12.1. As number 2, announce your overshoot to alert number 3 that you are encroaching
   on his or her side of number 1 (“Texan 2 is overshooting”). Clear to ensure sufficient
   spacing on number 3 before returning to the inside of the turn, reestablish yourself on the
   rejoin line, and complete the rejoin.
   11.12.2. As number 3, if number 2 overshoots, modify your rejoin by decreasing your
   airspeed and adjusting your pursuit option to ensure adequate clearance as number 2 returns
   to the inside of number 1‘s turn. If you extend the speed brake or remain in zero torque to
   rapidly bleed your airspeed, notify number 4 (“Texan 3, idle or speed brake”).
   11.12.3. As number 4, follow number 3 whether number 3 is overshooting or adjusting for a
   number 2 overshoot. If number 3 is overshooting, use good judgment and a combination of
   trail and rejoin techniques to stay with number 3. Maintain a 100-foot clearance (minimum)
   until number 3 is in route.
 250                                                     AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   11.12.4. When executing an overshoot as number 3 or 4, use the same procedures as
   described for a number 2 overshoot. However, when stabilized on the outside of the turn, you
   must determine whether it is more appropriate to remain on the outside of the turn or return
   to the inside to complete the rejoin.
11.13. Leaving Formation (Breaking Out). Leaving formation is the same in three- and four-
ship formations as in two-ship formations, except:
   11.13.1. If number 2 or 4 breaks out of fingertip formation, the remaining aircraft will
   maintain their original positions on number 1. If number 3 leaves formation, number 4 will
   follow number 3 at a safe distance to maintain element integrity.
   11.13.2. Number 1 will direct the rejoin to the desired formation. An aircraft that has left
   formation will not rejoin until directed by number 1.
11.14. Speed Brakes. Speed brakes are lowered or raised on verbal signal by number 1 or
element lead if required. Visual signals are generally not used in four-ship formations. Speed
brakes will not be raised or lowered when the formation is in an echelon turn.
11.15. In-Flight Lead Changes:
   11.15.1. Four-ship lead changes are made from fingertip or echelon. Selected procedures
   must be thoroughly reviewed in the formation briefing. The most commonly used method is
   for number 1 to direct the formation to go to route (“Texan, go route”). The wingmen will
   acknowledge and move to route.
   11.15.2. After the formation is stable in the route position, number 1 will announce the lead
   change by stating “Texan 3 (or 2), you have the lead.” The new lead will acknowledge
   “Texan 3 (or 2) has the lead,” at which time the lead change is completed. The new lead will
   pick up the ―1‖ call sign, and confirm the new formation positions with a radio call, “Texan,
   check,” before reforming the formation to fingertip, and beginning other maneuvers.
   11.15.3. During lead changes from fingertip, number 3 always becomes the new number 1;
   number 4 becomes number 2; number 1 becomes number 3; and number 2 becomes number
   4 (Figure 11.9).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                            251


Figure 11.9. Route Fingertip Lead Change for a Four-Ship Formation.




   11.15.4. During lead changes from echelon, original lead either becomes number 2 or 4 as
   briefed. When original lead becomes number 2; the original number 2 becomes lead; and
   numbers 3 and 4 keep their previous positions (Figure 11.10). When original lead becomes
   number 4, number 2 becomes lead, number 3 becomes number 2, and number 4 becomes
   number 3 (Figure 11.11).
 252                                               AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011

Figure 11.11. Route Echelon Lead Change for a Four-Ship Formation (Lead to Number 4).




11.16. Three-Ship Formation:
   11.16.1. General. If flying a three-ship formation due to a ground or takeoff abort, lead will
   be directive and renumber the aircraft in the flight. In a three-ship formation, wingmen may
   fly the normal positions for number 2 and 3, or may practice phantom 2. Phantom 2 allows
   the wingmen to practice flying number 3 and 4 positions as if they were in a four-ship
   formation. If flying phantom 2, numbers 2 and 3 will fly the positions of numbers 3 and 4.
254                                                       AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


  During phantom 2, turning rejoins are to the outside of the turn; straight-ahead rejoins are to
  the same side; and wing work is done with numbers 2 and 3 on the same side.
  11.16.2. Three-Ship Rejoins. When flying phantom 2 for turning rejoins, follow the
  procedures for the second element for numbers 3 and 4. When flying standard three ship,
  numbers 2 and 3 positions use normal four-ship procedures.
  11.16.3. Wing Work or Echelon. Lead of a three-ship formation will signal for echelon by
  using the same procedures as in a four-ship formation. If flying phantom 2, direct echelon
  turns by radio call (“Texan, echelon turn”). In phantom 2, if an echelon turn is not directed,
  numbers 2 and 3 will maintain fingertip references (in numbers 3 and 4 positions). Lead will
  be directive when reforming the formation to the fingertip position.
  11.16.4. Three-Ship Lead Changes:
      11.16.4.1. During lead changes from route fingertip, number 3 will move forward (as in
      a four-ship element lead change) to become number 1; original number 1 will become
      number 2; and number 2 will become number 3. After the lead change, the formation is in
      echelon position (Figure 11.12).
AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011                                                             255


Figure 11.12. Route Fingertip Lead Change for a Three-Ship Formation.




      11.16.4.2. During lead changes from route echelon, the original number 1 will either
      drop back to the route fingertip number 2 position (number 2 will become lead, and
      number 3 will stay number 3), or drop back and cross behind the flight to the number 3
      position (number 2 will become lead, and number 3 will become number 2).
 256                                                      AFMAN11-248 19 JANUARY 2011


   11.16.5. Three-Ship Lead Changes During Phantom 2. Lead changes during phantom 2
   are performed from the route echelon position. Lead drops back and crosses behind the flight
   to the number 3 position. Number 2 will become lead, and number 3 will become number 2.
11.17. Lost Wingman (Three-Ship):
   11.17.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climb, Descent, or Straight-and-Level). The lost wingman
   will turn away, using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds. He or she will inform number 1,
   resume course, and obtain a separate clearance.
   11.17.2. Turns (Climb, Descent, or Level). When outside the turn, the lost wingman will
   reverse the direction of turn, using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, and inform lead. He or
   she will roll out and continue straight ahead to ensure separation before resuming the turn
   and obtain a separate clearance. When inside the turn, the lost wingman will momentarily
   reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and tell number 1 to roll out of the turn. Maintain
   AOB to ensure lateral separation then obtain a separate clearance. Number 1 may resume
   turn only when separation is ensured. If in a three-ship flight with both aircraft on the same
   side of number 1, refer to four-ship lost wingman procedures (paragraph 11.18).
   11.17.3. Precision and Nonprecision Final Approach. The lost wingman will
   momentarily turn away from lead to ensure separation and start a climb to either the final
   approach fix or glide slope intercept altitude, as appropriate. While proceeding to the missed
   approach point, he or she will inform lead and obtain a separate clearance from approach
   control. Either comply with the new clearance received, or fly the published missed
   approach, as appropriate.
   11.17.4. Missed Approach. The lost wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
   clearance, inform number 1, and continue the published missed approach while climbing 500
   feet above the missed approach altitude. The wingman will obtain a separate clearance from
   approach control.
11.18. Lost Wingman (Four-Ship). Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures described in
paragraph 11.17. However, because it is impossible for number 4 to immediately determine
number 3 still has visual contact with lead, number 4‘s initial action must assume number 3 has
also become separated. If number 4 loses sight of number 3, number 4 will proceed as follows:
   11.18.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform lead and turn away, using 30 degrees
   of bank for 30 seconds. Then resume course and obtain a separate clearance.
   11.18.2. Turns (Climb, Descent, or Level). On the outside of the turn, reverse the direction
   of the turn, using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and
   number 3. Obtain a separate clearance. (Using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds will
   develop a significant heading change from lead.) Maintain SA for obstacle clearance when
   separating from lead. On the inside of the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail
   separation and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Tell lead to roll out of the turn. Obtain a
   separate clearance. Lead will resume the turn only when separation is ensured.
