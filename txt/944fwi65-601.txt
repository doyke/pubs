SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision removes the following sentence; Finance Management (FM) will be a function of a
committee action and not solely by one individual or organization in paragraph 2. Administrative
assistant removed in paragraph 2.1.4, lead recruiter removed in paragraph 2.15. Between groups,
up to $10K and realignment actions greater than $10K will require Finance Management Board’s
(FMB) approval prior to the action removed in paragraph 5. An (|) indicates revisions from the
previous edition.
1. Resource Management Systems. RMS will establish and prioritize requirements, obtain and
maximize the use of scarce resources, measure actual to planned performance, and achieve cost
effective results.
 2                                                       944FWI65-601 19 SEPTEMBER 2012


     1.1. RMS includes the financial plan, participatory and committee management, the
     Resource Management Team (RMT), and resource management training.
2. Participatory Management. Committees are established to review programs and the
financial funding of the 944 FW. These committees determine the financial constraints the 944
FW will operate under. A reduction in the scope of certain programs and the deferment or
elimination of others may become necessary to accomplish the mission within these constraints.
There will not be any unilateral management of programs when all programs are competing for
the same limited resources. However, during an emergency situation the 944 FW Commander
may choose not to call a FMB meeting when time is of the essence.
     2.1. Financial Management Board. The FMB is established to determine program
     priorities and ensure resources are allocated in the most effective way. The FMB reviews,
     approves, or disapproves recommendations made by the Financial Working Group (FWG) to
     ensure balanced valid financial programs and to consider all known or anticipated program
     requirements. Meetings will occur at least once per quarter until superseded. Membership to
     the FMB is stated below and additional membership is at the discretion of the chairperson.
        2.1.1. Chairperson: 944 FW Commander (944 FW/CC)
        2.1.2. Members: 944 FW Executive Officer (944 FW/CCE), 944th Mission Support
        Group Commander (944 MSG/CC), 944th Operations Group Commander (944 OG/CC),
        944th Medical Squadron Commander (944 MDS/CC), and 944th Aeromedical Staging
        Squadron Commander (944 ASTS/CC).
        2.1.3. Recorder: 944th Fighter Wing Finance (944 FW/FM) member.
        2.1.4. Advisors: 944 FW/FM Officer.
     2.2. Financial Working Group (FWG). The FWG is the working level FM group and
     consists of primary and alternate resource advisors (RAs). The primary purpose of the FWG
     is to validate and prioritize the 944 FW’s funds and to present concerns to the FMB for their
     discussion and/or resolution. Membership to the FWG is at the discretion of the Group
     Commanders in the organization. New members should be appointed no later than 15
     calendar days after a position becomes vacant. Cost center managers (CCMs) may attend
     FWG meetings, but are not required to do so.
        2.2.1. Chairperson: FM Officer
        2.2.2. Members: Primary/alternate RA for 944 FW Staff, primary/alternate RA for 944
        FW Recruiting (610 RR FF/OLBR), primary/alternate RA for 944 OG, primary/alternate
        RA for 944 MSG, primary/alternate RA for 944 MDS, and primary/alternate RA for 944
        ASTS.
        2.2.3. Advisors: 944 FW/FM Analysts
3. Appointment of Financial Managers. Appointment to the position of Resource Manager

within 90 days of appointment to the position. If the new RM has experience in Resource
944FWI65-601 19 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                3


Management, a letter can be used to identify the experience in lieu of the training. Training of
CCMs is the responsibility of the primary Group RA. Training folders for the primary and
alternate RA will be maintained in the FM office. The Group RA will maintain training folders
on their cost center managers.
