  RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND FOREIGN
                           MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all personnel who fly
onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides guidance on the Jump Record
Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight authorization (FA) codes in Table A2.3. for Air
Force parachutists. Further guidance on parachutist policies and requirements can be found in AFI
11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.

1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O-A):
   1.2.1. Establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in this instruction to ensure
   effective use of resources.
   1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction.

1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM flying pro-
grams. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this instruction and to meet
training and operational needs of the Air Force.
1.3. (AMC) Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. Aircrew Operations and Training (Force Management)
(HQ AMC/A3TF) has overall responsibility for coordinating the basic instruction and managing the
AMC supplement.
   1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or maintaining an air-
   craft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3;
   coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured through non-DoD resources will not be
   flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM approval.
   1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within their
   commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft responsibility,
   MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an MDS-specific fleet.
   MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand-down of aircrew personnel when warranted by oper-
   ational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down
   has no immediate impact on the operational status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational
   unit commander directing unit aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the
   commander time to assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations.
   Notification will be provided IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101, Aircraft
   and Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal operations will
   be initiated by the MAJCOM Commander directing the original grounding/stand-down. Authority for
   grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by MAJCOMs in supplements to this and other gov-
   erning AFIs, but not lower than MAJCOM/A3/A4.
   1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in aircraft-spe-
   cific AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional interfly guidance in MAJ-
8                                                             AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


    COM supplements to this AFI. Interfly agreements must be approved prior to flight. Ensure unit
    coordination. Ensure required information is provided to members’ Host Aviation Resource Manage-
    ment (HARM) offices.
    1.3.3. (AMC) Interfly. For purposes of this supplement, interfly is defined as the exchange and/or
    substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to accomplish flying missions.
    During contingencies, exercises, or designated missions, interfly operations will be conducted accord-
    ing to appropriate OPLAN or CONOPS. See the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Specific, Vol 3 publica-
    tions for interfly requirements.
    1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) “S” (Table 2.6.) (except Duty
    Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or ASC “04” (Table 2.5.) beyond 180 days without being dis-
    qualified for aviation service, returned to flying, or reassigned to non-flying status/duty. MAJCOM/
    A3T or equivalent is the waiver authority for the 180-day limit. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority
    to extend members in this status beyond 365 days. Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all
    cases waived beyond 365 days.
NOTE: For members previously in DNIF status, the 180-day period begins on the date the member was
cleared to perform flying duties.
    1.3.5. Ensure FSC “K” (Table 2.6.) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active Aircrew
    Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft, flying hours, etc.).
    To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position occupied by a member assigned
    FSC “K” must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the end of each fiscal year. Upon completion of
    the revalidation, send notification to the member’s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM)
    office authorizing the continuance of FSC “K.” Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See para-
    graph 1.4.1.9. for additional guidance.
       1.3.5.1. FSC “K” is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to permanent
       change of station PCS or permanent change of assignment PCA actions.
    1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
    assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviation service and
    assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension, disqualifica-
    tion, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should be disqualified from aviation
    service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned to flying.

1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
    1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction. Com-
    manders will:
       1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command for flying
       duties.
       1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility. Commanders
       may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by maintenance, operational, or
       safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10-206.
       1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation for safe
       conduct of flight.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                     9


     1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew members’ qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
     1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations that may
     affect an aircrew member’s aviation service.
     1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer than 18
     years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20
     years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and
     is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status.
     1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have the appro-
     priate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member may have already
     separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be made to accomplish the dis-
     qualification action before the aircrew member is separated or dismissed.
     1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC “S” or ASC “04” do not exceed 180 days in this
     status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is required, the mem-
     ber’s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver prior to the 180-day limit. If
     a waiver of the 180-limit was previously approved IAW paragraph 1.3.4., the member’s unit com-
     mander must again obtain waiver approval prior to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC “S” or
     ASC “04” status. AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and
     Badges, provides applicable guidance for suspensions/disqualifications. See paragraph 3.1.6.4. for
     additional guidance.
        1.4.1.8.1. (Added-AMC) Commanders should coordinate closely with the servicing Host
        Aviation Resource Management (HARM) Chief, explore all options and be fully briefed on all
        ramifications prior to selecting a course of action concerning any Rated Aircrew Member or
        Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) who will exceed the 180-day limit for Flying Status Code
        (FSC) “S” and 04 (except members in DNIF status). Commanders will provide justification to
        the HARM office at the 150-day point explaining why the incumbent will remain in “S” or 04
        status beyond 180 days. If member will not return to flying at the 180-day point, the FSC “S”
        extension request must be received at MAJCOM/A3T before exceeding 180-days. The
        HARM office will forward this request for extension, complete with full justification, to HQ
        AMC/A3T prior to the expiration of the 180-day limit.
        1.4.1.8.2. (Added-AMC) Forward recommendations to HQ AMC/A3T, 402 SCOTT DRIVE,
        UNIT 3A1, SCOTT AFB, IL 62225-5302. AMC’s Aviation Resource Management Branch
        will staff these recommendations to the MAJCOM/A3T for evaluation and determination as to
        the validity of converting or retaining the position.
        1.4.1.8.3. (Added-AMC) Without an approved waiver, the unit’s OG/CC must recommend
        Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) or Aircrew Evaluation Board (AEB) action to the Wing Com-
        mander or equivalent for individuals who have been in FSC “S” for more than 180 days
        (except members in DNIF status). If an FEB or AEB action is not recommended, the unit’s
        OG/CC will notify HQ AMC/A3T, 402 SCOTT DRIVE, UNIT 3A1, SCOTT AFB, IL
        62225-5302, and provide supporting documentation as to why the individual should not meet
        an FEB/AEB under the provisions of AFI 11-402.
     1.4.1.9. The OG/CC or equivalent will notify the servicing HARM office when to assign FSC
     “K.” Include justification and provide an information copy to the MAJCOM/A3. (EXCEPTION:
     MAJCOM/A3 notification not required for members returned to flying status as a result of an FEB
10                                                          AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


        proceeding and not flying due to a lack of support capability. Assign FSC “K” to these members.)
        The HARM office will publish the AO, with explanation remarks, and file the notification memo
        permanently on the left side of the FRF. If required, the OG/CC will submit a revalidation request
        to the MAJCOM/A3 no later than 30 October. Upon receipt, the HARM office will permanently
        file on the left side of the member’s FRF all letters assigning FSC “K” and all MAJCOM/A3
        revalidation approvals.
            1.4.1.9.1. (Added-AMC) FSC “K” letters of explanation and annual re-validation requests
            will be submitted for staffing to the AMC Aviation Resource Management Branch (HQ AMC/
            A3TF) by the servicing HARM office.
     1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned aircrew and parachutist
     members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members’ flying status and parachutist members'
     jump status with the HARM office. NOTE: This includes all Air Force Reserve Command Individ-
     ual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to active duty units at gaining MAJCOMs.
        1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew
        Management.
            1.4.2.1.1. Commanders must notify the HARM office when staff or flight surgeon flying posi-
            tions (API 5, 6, 8, B, or D) are double billeted and identify which aircrew member to assign
            inactive flying activity, FSC H, within 30 days of assignment to the position, IAW Table 2.1.,
            Note 3. When excess aircrew members are identified, HARM offices will contact the applica-
            ble commander if notification is not provided. Unless AF/A3O-A approves authorization of
            excess crewmembers, the HARM office will inactivate aeronautical orders for those flyers in
            excess of the unit authorization.
            1.4.2.1.1. (AMC) For AMC, active flying of both incumbents of a staff flying position
            beyond 30 days may occasionally become necessary due to current critical manning of certain
            aircrew specialties. Waivers to this provision will only be considered on a case-by-case basis,
            and with full and complete justification. Submit waiver request through AMC/A3T to AF/
            A30T. Without an approved waiver in place, only the primary incumbent will be allowed to
            actively fly past 30 days and the provisions of the basic directive apply. Failure to identify a
            designated primary incumbent will result in the HARM assigning that designation to the indi-
            vidual with the greatest retainability and rendering the remaining individual inactive at the
            30-day point.
        1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW AFI 11-402.
        1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms notify
        the base HARM office of all non-flying/non-parachuting TDYs, projected PCS, retirement, or
        separation actions. This requirement can be met by forwarding copies of all aircrew/parachutist
        members’ TDY, permanent change of station (PCS), retirement, or separation orders to the base
        HARM office to process required AO or ARMS actions.
            1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members pick up their FRF/JRF from
            the HARM office prior to final outprocessing for PCS assignments.
            1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms
            notify the HARM office prior to a permanent change of assignment (PCA) action.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        11


   1.4.3. (Added-AMC) Ensure one of the top three squadron supervisors (Squadron Commander,
   Operations Officer, or Assistant Operations Officer) are available during all local flying activities.
   The person in charge must be immediately available to respond to any Current Operations issues
   requiring time-sensitive answers, decisions and/or actions. In the event the Operations Officer or
   Assistant Operations Officer will not be available during any required absence of the commander, the
   Squadron Commander must have the approval of the OG/CC (or equivalent) prior to designating
   highly qualified senior Flight Commanders to perform squadron supervisory duties. Note: Aeromedi-
   cal Evacuation (AE) Squadron Commanders may designate an AE Operations Officer, Senior Flight
   Nurse, Senior Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET), or equivalent to perform supervisor duties
   upon approval of OG/CC (or equivalent).

1.5. Responsibilities of Aircrew Members and Parachutists.
   1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying and parachute jump resources to obtain and maintain
   aircrew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or jump billets. See AFI 11-402 for
   guidance pertaining to failure of members to accomplish aircrew or parachutist training requirements.
      1.5.1.1. Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) or Tenant Aviation Resource Man-
      agement (TARM) offices will assign aircrew or parachutist training requirements in ARMS to all
      fliers/jumpers assigned to active flying/jumping billets.
   1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review in the HARM office (except for geograph-
   ically separated units [GSU]) to validate aviation/parachutist service actions and the record of flying
   or jump accomplishments during the previous year. HARM offices may mail annual record review
   documents to a GSU for a member’s review and certification. Member will complete the review and
   sign the Individual Data Summary (IDS) not later than the end of the member’s birth month. (Does
   not apply to cadets who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
   1.5.2. (AMC) Aircrew members/parachutists come in phase for their annual records review 120 days
   prior to the end of their birth month. AMC aircrew members and parachutists will do a face-to-face
   annual flight records review except for geographically separated units (GSUs). All GSUs will still
   review the RIP and send back a signed copy to the HARM. In all cases, the aircrew member will
   review all of the information. If the information is correct, the aircrew member will sign and date all
   signature blocks on the Individual Data Summary (IDS) at the HARM and the Individual Flight
   Record (IFR). The HARM will update the annual records review date in Aviation Resource Manage-
   ment System (ARMS) and place the signed IDS in the aircrew member's flight record folder (FRF). If
   the information is not correct, the member will still sign the IDS and will annotate the incorrect infor-
   mation. The member will also include the statement “record is not true and accurate” on the first page
   of the IDS. The HARM office will update ARMS with the appropriate code. If there are any changes
   to be made and source documents are not available, the HARM office will direct the member to the
   Air Force Board of Corrections of Military Records in accordance with AFI 11-421.
      1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is correct.
      Information maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official source documenta-
      tion. For example an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing flights and sorties, AETC
      Form 240-5 for student hours, an AF Form 922 or AF Form 4323 for missing jumps, Military ID
      or re-enlistment paperwork for date of separation change and personnel data that did not interface
      to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source documents, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the
      Air Force Board for Corrections to Military Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet
12                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


        36-2607, Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFB-
        CMR). HARM offices will ensure all flying hour corrections (especially to career totals) are sup-
        ported by a source document. A copy of the DD Form 149, flying hour logbook, or letter
        (submitted under previous Air Force policy) must be filed on the left side of the FRF IAW AFI
        11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
            1.5.2.1.1. AF/A3O-AT is OPR for AFBCMR requests. AF/A3O-AT may contact HARM
            offices directly to obtain documents for review/validation, to expedite corrective action if an
            AFBCMR request is received, or expedite corrective action to ARMS data received on the
            Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Management System (CHARM) report (RCS:
            HAF-A3O [M&AR] 0701).
        1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel will accomplish a records review within 120 days prior
        to departure and not later than 120 days following arrival at a new duty station. They are not
        required to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
        1.5.2.3. Aircrew/jump personnel suspended or disqualified for aviation service (does not include
        DNIF) will accomplish a FRF/JRF review within 30 days of the suspension or disqualification
        action. Geographically separated members will sign the review and return it to the HARM office
        within five duty-days of receipt.
NOTE: Once removed from DNIF status, members remaining in suspended status will accomplish a
records review within 30 days.
     1.5.3. Ensure the HARM office maintaining the FRF or JRF is aware of a pending PCS. The HARM
     office must be advised of the proposed departure date, date of last flight or jump before departure, and
     date the individual will pick up the FRF or JRF. Member must notify the HARM office at least five
     days prior to departure, if applicable. Validate flights accomplished before departing PCS and sign
     ARMS generated PCS products IAW AFI 11-421.

        1.5.3.2. (DELETE)
        1.5.3.3. (DELETE)
        1.5.3.4. (Added-AMC) If applicable, the member will notify AMC/A3TF to delete attachment
        upon departure to a new assignment.
     1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), Flying History Report (FHR), FRF or JRF before
     departing for PCS or flying/jumping TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1.). Members must ensure they have a copy
     of their current AO, IDS, and ARMS training summary, prior to departure on a jump/flying TDY.
     Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to attend jump school, must give the HARM office a
     copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior to TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO
     authorizing jump status.
     1.5.4. (AMC) Individuals scheduled to depart PCS, TDY (e.g. formal school), separate or retire will
     be responsible for notifying the HARM office 5 duty days prior to the date they desire to pick up their
     Flight Record Package (FRP). The FRP will also include the member’s AF IMT 4324s and the indi-
     vidual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) if applicable. The individual will hand-carry the FRP to the
     next duty station. If the member fails to pick-up the FRP, the HARM office will obtain the forwarding
     address of gaining HARM and mail the appropriate records.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                      13


   1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that the record
   was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes flying TDY). The FRF/
   JRF must be reviewed by the member within 30 days after arrival at a new permanent duty station.
   Inactive aircrew members must also turn in the FRF and FEF within 10 duty days. If a member does
   not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, the HARM office will suspend aviation career incen-
   tive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP)
   (via a Military Pay Order [MPO]) until receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification. HARM
   offices will consider mailed records as “turned in” and will not suspend incentive pay for these mem-
   bers. HARM offices will make every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay.
   HARM offices will ensure FRFs/JRFs are inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 calendar days
   after receipt of the records.
NOTE: The losing HARM office will mail the FRF to the gaining HARM office if the member’s next
duty location HARM office is not collocated within the gaining HARM office.
   1.5.5. (AMC) Active and inactive flight/jump record folders will be turned into the servicing HARM
   office no later than 5 duty days after arrival at a new duty station. HARMs will establish local proce-
   dures with the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to ensure flying/jumping personnel (active and inac-
   tive) are identified and informed of their responsibility to deliver the FRP/JRP to the HARM. Inactive
   members will turn in the FRF, FEF and AF IMT 4324s within 5 days of arriving at a new duty station.
   If the member does not deliver the FRP/JRP to the HARM within the 5 duty day limit, the HARM will
   suspend the member’s ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP until receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification.
   Mailed records will be considered “turned in” and incentive pay will not be suspended. NOTE: Active
   flying personnel will not be scheduled for flight activity until the HARM receives the FRP/JRP.
      1.5.5.1. Aircrew members and parachutists assigned to an inactive API code/duty position (after
      an active flying assignment – PCA or PCS) will turn in their FEF to the HARM office within five
      duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying position (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an
      API-3 position, etc.). The HARM office will file the FEF inside the member's FRF. If the member
      returns to active flying status, the HARM office will forward the FEF to the member's flying unit.
   1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the Flight Medicine Element (FME) within 10 duty-days after arriv-
   ing at new duty station and complete initial medical clearance requirements prior to first flight or
   jump.
      1.5.6.1. (Added) Initial medical clearance requirements also apply to members who deploy for
      365 days or longer in TDY or PCS status.
   1.5.7. Complete a Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) annually not later than the last day of, but not
   earlier than five months prior to, the member’s birth month.
   1.5.8. Members will sign out their AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record (origi-
   nal), and AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (copy)
   from the HARM office prior to attending physiological/centrifuge training. Upon completion of train-
   ing, return forms to the HARM office within 5 duty days after arrival at home station.
   1.5.9. Inactive aircrew members will notify the HARM office not later than 10 calendar days prior to
   departing on an authorized flying TDY (includes requalification courses).

     1.5.10. Request attachment for flying according to paragraph 2.20. when assigned to an active flying
     billet in a unit without flying facilities or aircraft.
     1.5.11. When aircrew members depart PCS or PCA, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not nega-
     tively affect Operational Flying Duty Accumulation (OFDA) credit. Aircrew members p require at
     least 15 days on active flying status in a month to receive OFDA credit for that month. See Chapter
     2, paragraph 2.6., for additional guidance pertaining to operational flying duty.
        1.5.11.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned to an
        inactive billet should make every effort to outprocess from their unit/base after the 15th of the
        month to provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if flight requirements
        are also met).
        1.5.11.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an active
        billet should outprocess from their unit/base before the 15th of the month to provide an opportu-
        nity to obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment in an active billet (if flight require-
        ments are also met).

1.6. Flying Obligations.
     1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force mem-
     bers on active duty to make flights in any aircraft. Members are not entitled to incentive pay unless
     placed on active AOs that require them to perform specific in-flight duties on a frequent and regular
     basis as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled to such pay if the pay is suspended by the
     President according to Title 37 United States Code (USC). Members are entitled to flight credit IAW
     paragraph 3.3..
     1.6.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3 will gain specific AMC/CC approval for waivers for combat or national
     emergency missions. During times of war, commanders will obtain AMC/CC waiver authority prior
     to scheduling aircrew members to perform flight duties while in DNIF status. Submit waiver requests
     IAW the provisions of para 1.7.
        1.6.1.1. Members qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties log
        the appropriate aircrew certification code IAW Table A2.3. and flying hours associated with
        duties performed IAW Section 3B of this instruction.
        1.6.1.2. Members not qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties
        log “O” or “X” aircrew certification code (first character) and other time IAW paragraph 3.4.5..
     1.6.2. In Time of Peace. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force members
     on active duty to make official flights when in the best interest of the Air Force. Aircrew members on
     active flying status AOs will receive incentive pay if otherwise qualified and flight requirements are
     met (does not apply to non-interference fliers on AOs). Rated officers and CEAs will receive OFDA
     credit if otherwise qualified.
        1.6.2.1. Military aircrew members who are properly qualified, meet the criteria of this instruction
        and AFI 11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are directed to perform specific inflight duties
        on a frequent and regular basis will be placed on AOs and a flight authorization.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       15


        1.6.2.1.1. An aircrew member not obtaining or maintaining qualification in a specific aircraft
        will be placed on the flight authorization for that aircraft only when his or her presence is
        required for accomplishment of the mission. (See also paragraph 1.8.1..). These members will
        log time IAW paragraph 3.3. of this instruction.
        1.6.2.1.2. Aircrew members in a specialty not listed in an AFI 65-503 crew complement, who
        are not obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification, may be authorized to fly IAW para-
        graph 3.3. of this instruction when required for the mission.
     1.6.2.2. Non-aircrew members who are properly qualified and directed to perform specific
     inflight non-interference duties will be placed on AOs and the flight authorization but will not be
     placed on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Refer to para-
     graphs 2.12.4. and 2.12.7. for additional guidance. EXCEPTION: Non-aircrew members assigned
     to flying unit commander positions or unmanned aerial system (UAS) sensor operator positions
     may log flying time in assigned aircraft IAW paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2. and 3.3.1.5.3..
     1.6.2.3. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and maintain
     qualification in the aircraft, must fly in passenger status, will be placed on a passenger manifest,
     and must fly on commercial or military aircraft with adequate facilities for transporting passen-
     gers. Refer to paragraphs 1.9.4.7., 2.12.5., and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further pas-
     senger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders, including unit commanders, may detail by written orders personnel under
     their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign government accredited by
     the United States, provided the flights do not add additional expense to the US Government, and
     provided personnel are on AOs authorizing frequent and regular flights. See paragraph 1.11. for
     additional guidance.
     1.6.2.5. Personnel not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique ground sup-
     port duties at an enroute location or the point of destination that are directly related and essential
     to the particular aircraft or mission being flown, e.g., a maintenance specialist required to perform
     routine ground maintenance or a security team required to guard the aircraft at enroute or destina-
     tion stops, may fly as Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). MAJCOMs may further
     define MEGP in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See paragraph 1.12.2.2. for additional
     guidance.
     1.6.2.5. (AMC) MEGP, IAW AFPD 10-21, are eligible support personnel performing unique
     duties directly associated with and essential to a particular mobility aircraft, aircrew or mission
     (except 89 AW and special operations missions). Mobility support duties include maintenance
     personnel (including recovery teams), TALCE, and security forces (including PHOENIX
     RAVEN. Note: Do not substitute MEGP status for Operational Support Fliers performing essen-
     tial specific in-flight duties regularly assigned crewmembers.
        1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown
        authorizes MEGP status. MEGP may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW
        the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility. EXCEPTIONS: (a) MEGPs
        who are mission essential to aircraft launch/recovery may fly on aircraft not normally
        equipped for carrying passengers. MEGPs who fly under the provisions of this exception must
        be physically and physiologically (when required) qualified and must complete applicable
        egress training prior to flight. (b) Under exceptional conditions (e.g. national emergency,
16                                                         AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


            severe weather, earthquake, flood) MEGP may be flown on non-passenger carrying aircraft if
            their duties are essential to the maintenance of the aircraft at the recovery base. All steps
            should be taken to pre-deploy these personnel via other means of transportation, if adequate
            time permits.
            1.6.2.5.1. (AMC) Procedures. All MEGPs require valid travel orders annotated with MEGP
            status or endorsed approval memorandum for validation. Personnel authorized MEGP must be
            eligible and familiar with the policies and procedures governing MEGP travel. MEGP’s desir-
            ing travel must notify the C2 agency and ensure ATOC is advised at least 3 hours prior to
            planned departure time. This notification may be waived in the case of a short notice require-
            ment as deemed necessary by C2 and ATOC in coordination with the aircraft commander.
            Maintenance and PHOENIX RAVEN personnel not actively performing duties on the mission
            aircraft (i.e. pre-positioning or de-positioning) will process through the passenger terminal.
            The approval authority may allow other MEGPs to be escorted by the aircrew and not process
            through the passenger terminal. Aircrews will manifest MEGPs on DD Form 2131, Passenger
            Manifest, and include anti-hijack protective measures according to AFI 13-207, Preventing
            and Resisting/ Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking).
            1.6.2.5.2. (Added-AMC) Approval Authority. OG/CCs may approve MEGP status for per-
            sonnel on their unit aircraft. MEGP status will be strictly controlled. Do not use MEGP status
            as a substitute for Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)-reimbursable, point-to-point
            travel of duty passengers IAW DoD 4515.13R). AMC units with unique requirements, condi-
            tions, or clarification of MEGP policy or procedures should forward MEGP requirements
            (memorandum or message format) to their parent MAJCOM/A3 or HQ AMC/A3V, DSN
            576-5080, FAX 576-5692 for clarification/approval (anticipate 10 days for reply).
        1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members to travel in Additional Crewmember (ACM)
        status. ACMs will be defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See
        paragraph 1.12.2.2. for additional guidance.
        1.6.2.6. (AMC) See AMCI 11-208 for additional ACM/MEGP requirements.
            1.6.2.6.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown
            grants ACM status. (EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC
            Senior Controller may approve ACM status. The AMC Standardization/Evaluation Chief
            [AMC/A3V] may approve ACM status for AMC or AMC-gained missions for evaluators
            assigned to HQ AMC.) ACM may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW
            provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
            1.6.2.6.1. (AMC) For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller (an
            O-6) may approve ACM status. The Chief of Standardization/Evaluation Division may
            approve ACM status on any AMC or AMC-gained missions for the evaluators assigned to HQ
            AMC.

1.7. Waivers.
     1.7.1. For Combat Missions or National Emergencies. MAJCOM commanders may waive any
     requirements of this instruction when necessary to carry out combat missions or to accomplish mis-
     sions flown during a state of national emergency. Provide notification to AF/A3/5 with a copy to AF/
     A3O-AT.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       17


   1.7.2. At Other Times. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, AF/A3O-A is the waiver
   authority for this instruction. Request waivers through applicable channels to the MAJCOM/A3, or
   equivalent level. MAJCOM/A3s (or equivalents) will forward to AF/A3O-A, with a courtesy copy to
   AF/A3O-AT. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM agency that gener-
   ated the supplement.
   1.7.3. Administrative Procedures. MAJCOMs may publish HQ USAF waivers in supplements citing
   the authority (e.g., HQ USAF/A3O memo, date, subject). See AFI 33-360, Volume 1, Air Force Con-
   tent Management Program—Publications, for additional guidance on waivers to publications.

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
   1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders) issue written
   authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform inflight duties on the mission. Units will
   use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight Authoriza-
   tion, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's (including unit commanders) verbal authoriza-
   tion may direct aircraft flight only when time constraints or administrative procedures prevent written
   authorization. Written confirmation of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight
   Authorization (FA) has been signed, changes must be validated by a designated approving authority
   by placing the approving authority's initials by the line changed. The OG/CC or equivalent com-
   mander with operational control of the mission is responsible for the publication/maintenance/reten-
   tion of the aircraft FAs for each mission flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers and officer
   equivalent government civilians in active flying positions are authorized to be authenticating officials
   for Flight Authorizations. FA authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or
   equivalent commander.
   EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and ANG Senior Scout unit com-
   manders with aircrew members but no assigned aircraft, may accomplish a FA for assigned aircrew
   members required to perform aircrew duties on the mission. Commanders must ensure all members
   listed meet go-no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand-alone document and
   must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were required to per-
   form in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew duties on more than one
   mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a minimum, the information in
   blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight authorization. In the Remarks section of the
   aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a critical
   document used to validate aircrew member’s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781.
   EXCEPTION 2: UAS units will complete a preflight authorization signed by the aircraft commander
   to confirm go-no-go checks were completed. The authenticating official will issue a verbal order for
   the mission. The FA will be published upon termination of the mission and include crew members
   who flew on the mission, verbal order acknowledged in the remark section, and AC block initialed by
   the duty scheduler.
   1.8.1. (AMC) Flight authorizations (jump orders) previously issued for commanders, operations
   officers, and Standardization and Evaluation Flight Examiners are not valid authorizations and will
   not be published. The HQ AMC/A3V Division Chief or his/her designated deputy will appoint HQ
   AMC Flight Examiners in a letter validating the individual’s qualification to fly on required missions
18                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     (See Attachment 7.8 of this supplement). AMC Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Examiners
     will ensure their orders state “Variations Authorized” and ensure one of the following remarks is place
     on their travel order (DD Form 1610): “Member is required to perform in-flight duties during ASEV
     inspection” or “Member is required to conduct no-notice/spot evaluations on AMC aircraft.” Prior to
     flights, AMC Stan Eval examiners will provide the SARM or Aircraft Commander their approval let-
     ter, TDY orders, Individual Data Summary and an Individual Training Summary. These documents
     will be used to conduct Go/No-go checks. Aircraft commanders will pen and ink ASEV evaluators on
     their orders. SARMs will file the Flight Authorization with the added crewmember(s) with their orig-
     inal Flight Authorization after post mission review. Local commanders, Operations Officers, and
     group or squadron Stan Eval Examiners will ensure they are written in on the Flight Authorization
     after Go/No-Go checks by the Aircraft Commander prior to their no-notice check flight.
        1.8.1.1. Units will validate go-no-go qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Stan-
        dardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in aircrew or opera-
        tional support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in command, or FA authenticating
        official if the pilot in command is not available, will validate go-no-go status for additional air-
        crew or operational support members prior to authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them
        to the FA. Validation may include ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for
        USAFA airmanship programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or
        designated representative), or a letter from the member's unit validating the individual's qualifica-
        tion to fly on required missions.
NOTE: When preparing flight authorizations for missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation
resource management specialist or designated representative responsible for go-no-go validation will
confirm the members’ aeronautical order status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and phys-
iological training) and qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA is an
official document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original, printed, signed forms
with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction and disposal of the original forms to
remove pen/ink changes after the flight authenticating official has signed the form and sorties/missions
have occurred is not authorized.
        1.8.1.2. (Added-AMC) AMC Policy for Issuing Aircraft Flight Authorizations. Computer-gener-
        ated flight authorizations not prepared in accordance with this supplement are not valid. Number
        all flight authorizations consecutively beginning with the first flight departing 1 Oct of each fiscal
        year and issue numbers from a manual flight authorization log. Maintain logs IAW AFPD 37-1,
        Air Force Information Management; and AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed
        IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. (See Table A5.3. (Added))
        1.8.1.3. (Added-AMC) Units are authorized to make pen-and-ink changes to flight authoriza-
        tions. The authenticating official must initial each change. A single flight authorization may be
        issued for a series of flights for exercises and contingencies (such as VOLANT PINE, operational
        readiness inspections, etc). The NCOIC, SARM will set up procedures to ensure the authoriza-
        tions are published correctly. EXCEPTION: The Aircraft Commander shall approve pen-and-ink
        changes made enroute. File flight authorization pen-and-ink changes made enroute with the
        SARM upon return to home station. The FA with the pen-and-ink changes will be attached to the
        original file copy.
NOTE: In addition to all other required documentation, go-no-go validation will also include the Flying

  1.8.2. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
     1.8.2.1. A designated pilot-in-command, and formation flight leader of each flight or flight ele-
     ment.
     1.8.2.1. (AMC) An additional Aircraft Commander (AC) or AC candidate (during upgrade eval-
     uation) may be in command on specific route segments. Units will use the remarks section of the
     flight authorization to annotate any change in pilot in command during a mission. Designate the
     "in-command" change over point for each pilot in the remarks section of the FA. Additionally,
     command of an aircraft (between mission ready ACs or above) can be exchanged anytime during
     flight; however, all crew members will be notified of the change of command and the off-going
     AC will thoroughly brief the on-coming AC of the status of the aircraft and mission. Note: Pilot
     flight examiners and instructors have the authority to take whatever action necessary to preclude
     an unsafe situation from occurring, including assuming command of the aircraft if conditions war-
     rant such action. This is not intended to be blanket authority to assume command without cause.
         1.8.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) Change of pilot in command during a mission will be used only to
         satisfy a valid training or evaluation requirement. As a minimum, designate one pilot with an
         “A” code to indicate overall responsibility for mission accomplishment. The “A” coded pilot
         in command is always accountable for overall conduct of the mission. Use alternate codes
         listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 4327a, Flight Authorization (PA), to indicate other
         current and qualified aircraft commanders who are authorized to act in command during spe-
         cific segments of the mission.
         1.8.2.1.2. (Added-AMC) Although the pilot with the “A” code has overall mission responsi-
         bility, any pilot designated as in command using an alternate code fulfills the requirement for
         the aircraft commander to be in the seat during critical phases of flight and the individual will
         be held accountable for his/her actions while in the seat.
         1.8.2.1.3. (Added-AMC) If both the “A” coded pilot and the alternate coded pilot are in the
         seats at the same time, the “A” code has command of the aircraft.
     1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3.) of each crewmember,
     operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position designation established
     by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
     1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, mission symbol, and call sign of aircraft or formation.
     1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
     1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
     1.8.2.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty performed
     incidental to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight authorization.
  1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew personnel on a
  memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties for that mission according
  to paragraphs 1.10. and 3.3. of this instruction. Except for ACMs and non-interference members, indi-
  viduals on the flight authorization should match those authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781,
  ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
     1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an orientation/familiarization
     flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing aircrew duties for that mission) will
20                                                            AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


        be listed on the passenger manifest. Passenger manifesting is required on all DoD owned and con-
        trolled aircraft, IAW DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part 1.
        1.8.3.2. If ACMs are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on the flight
        authorization in the Remarks section only. ACMs will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will
        not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit.
     1.8.4. If a mission is cancelled after the FA is signed, line through the canceled portion(s) of the flight
     authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or maintenance cancel).
     1.8.5. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance in this section for
     alert sorties.

1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
     1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support command oper-
     ations.
     1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) will ensure each flight is in the direct interest of
     government business and does not exceed flying hour allocations without specific approval. Com-
     manders (including unit commanders) will not authorize flights for personal convenience or recre-
     ation.

       1.9.4.7.1. Orientation Flights. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and motivate
       individuals (incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular
       weapon system and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the
       USAF. Table 1.1. is a matrix of approval authorities for orientation flights.
       1.9.4.7.1. (AMC) Commanders will include the local HARM office as part of the routing pro-
       cess to ensure all orientation flights are in compliance with AFI 11-401 and this supplement.
          1.9.4.7.1.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. Display USAF weapons systems to indi-

          ment of critical skills and will not be expanded to an all-skills, service-wide program.
          Spouse orientation flights will adhere to the following guidance:
          1.9.4.7.1.4. (AMC) Do not exceed available training hours to accommodate spouse orien-
          tation flights. Orientations will include mission briefing, debriefing, and any other briefing
          (at the commander discretion). An escort official (E-7 and above) will accompany spouses
          and support personnel at all times.

              1.9.4.7.1.4.4. Ensure a qualified pilot or copilot occupies the seat throughout the
              flight. Under no circumstances will a spouse be given control of the aircraft. The pilot
              in command will brief this restriction prior to each mission.
                  1.9.4.7.1.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) Prior to departure the AC, designated representa-
                  tive, or servicing aerial port facility will complete DD Form 2131, Passenger Man-

     US citizens, civic leaders, news media representatives, etc. See AFI 35-101 for guidance, to
     include approval authorities for public affairs flights.
     1.9.4.7.3. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOAs, and DRUs will administer orientation and public affairs
     flight programs according to the above guidelines. Secretary of Defense moratorium, “Civilian
     Visitors Operating Military Equipment” (22 Feb 01), and CSAF memorandum, “Air Force
     Policy on Civilian Visitors Operating Military Equipment” (20 Jul 01), apply. For approval

       policy/All other
       orientation flights

NOTES:
                   1. “Orientation flights” are defined as continuous flights performed within the local
                      flying area and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4).
                      “Note 1 N/A,” means the category of flight is not considered an orientation flight;
                      however, it is included in the table as a consolidated reference source.
                   2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by
                      SECAF. Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members
                      may be flown on orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant
                      Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23
                      Dec 1996.)
                   3. When aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander,
                      approval authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or
                      Theater Special Operations Command (SOC) commander.
                   4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.
                   5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure
                      requirements and political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent
                      to U.S. Federal government officials and do not include local government officials
                      such as mayors, police chiefs, and other local officials who do not represent a for-
                      eign government at the national level. Foreign military "civilian equivalents" are
                      comparable to DoD "civilian equivalents ."
                      a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied
                         according to AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology
                         Transfer Program.
                      b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional divi-
                         sion (four-letter level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns exist
                         that would prevent the flight. Contact SAF/IAR(_) on the Global address list
                         at saf.iar_@pentagon.af.mil (blank space is for regional division: Europe,
                         Middle East, Pacific, etc.).
                   6. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or
                      supporting flights utilized for logistics purposes only.
                   7. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or
                      members of Congress and their staffs.

     8. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure for-
        eign disclosure requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and dis-
        closure of USAF information are satisfied.
     9. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The con-
        tractors must be performing work in direct support of the approving command (air-
        crew training system and aircraft maintenance contractors are the most frequent
        participants). Normally, the requirement for familiarization flights should be spec-
        ified in the government contract.
     10. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for ori-
         entation flights.
     11. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, pro-
         gram participants may take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD
         4515.13-R, Chapter 4). Parental and/or guardian permission is required and the
         flight must be approved by SAF/PA. Specific Public Law guidance applies,
         including Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2012, and Title 32 USC,
         Section 508.
     12. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in
         writing.
     13. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels
         according to DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. NOTE: Exception to
         policy authority delegated from AF/CC to AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101. Send excep-
         tion to policy requests to AF/A3/5 with an info copy to AF/A3O-AT.
     14. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
     15. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized famil-
         iarization/orientation or incentive flights without an approved waiver from AF/
         A3O-AT.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       27


Table 1.1. (AMC) Orientation Flight Approval Authorities (by Type of Flight)
All requests for orientation flights requiring approval above wing level must be forwarded to HQ AMC/

1.10. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Air Force Aircraft.
   1.10.1. To perform inflight or parachutist duties, members must be specifically authorized and
   required for the mission, physically qualified, and current in physiological training when required
   IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. (Note: See AFI 11-202V1 for guid-
   ance regarding physiological training requirements if member will be removed from flying status
   within four months following the expiration date of physiological training currency.) An aircrew
   member or parachutist in DNIF status will not perform inflight aircrew or parachutist duties. Unit
   commanders will restrict individuals from performing inflight duties in the unit assigned aircraft when
   such performance may adversely impact safety, morale, or mission accomplishment. Commanders
   (including unit commanders) may authorize the following personnel to perform aircrew duties (as part
   of the authorized crew complement IAW AFI 65-503, U.S. Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
   required for the mission according to paragraph 3.3. of this instruction) and operational support duties
   (IAW AFI 11-402) on board Air Force aircraft: (NOTE: For guidance applicable to parachutist mem-
   bers performing duties in Air Force aircraft, see AFI 11-410.)
28                                                        AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical rating or
     aviation badge, are on active AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights, and are within the
     authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the mission. Aircrew
     members will perform duty associated with their current aeronautical rating and aircrew qualifica-
     tion. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit is not autho-
     rized.
     1.10.1.1. (AMC) Rated officers of other MAJCOMs or services may perform aeronautical duties
     (non-interfly) in AMC aircraft only when operationally required and after obtaining MAJCOM/
     A3T approval. Staff requests for approval through channels to arrive at HQ AMC/A3TF at least
     five duty days before the proposed flight. As a minimum, include name, rank, SSN, qualification
     in the aircraft requested, date of last flight, and point of contact. An instructor pilot occupying a
     position with a set of controls will accompany pilots not current in the aircraft. If the reason for
     performing duty in AMC aircraft is for interfly duties, follow the directions in para 1.10.1.1.1.
     EXCEPTIONS: Air Force Flight Surgeons (FS) from other commands may perform FS duties on
     AMC aircraft without HQ AMC/A3 approval, paragraph 2.20.1.1. (Added) of this supplement
     applies. Aircrew members from other commands augmenting Operational Readiness Inspection
     (ORI)/standardization teams/higher headquarters evaluation teams are authorized to fly in AMC
     aircraft without HQ AMC/A3 approval. (ARC units comply with the appropriate supplement to
     the basic instruction.)
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services on AOs, are
     required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis, and are within the autho-
     rized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the mission. Aircrew mem-
     bers will perform duty associated with their current aircrew specialty and aircrew qualification.
     Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers on AOs and required to perform specific inflight duties on an
     occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew members, and other
     non-rated members on non-interference AOs (paragraphs 2.12.3. and 2.12.4.) who fly occasion-
     ally to perform specific official inflight tasks. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for Haz-
     ardous Duty Incentive Pay is not authorized.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew duties at
     Air Force schools.
     1.10.1.5. Professionally qualified civilian employees of the US Government. MAJCOM com-
     manders determine individual qualifications.
        1.10.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) US Government civilian employees will meet the same profi-
        ciency, currency and medical standards as military members in like positions. Flying must be
        specified in the member’s current duty position description (PD) or AF Core Document (CD).
        US Government civilian employee flying time will not be entered in ARMS.
     1.10.1.6. Qualified employees or prospective employees of a government contractor according to
     the terms and conditions of a current government contract. The Squadron Aviation Resource Man-
     agement office will keep a copy of contract on file.
     1.10.1.7. Foreign nationals according to Section 1C of this instruction.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                          29


      1.10.1.8. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy, Air Force Reserve Officer Training
      Corps (ROTC) cadets, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) and Health
      Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) students participating in aviation related activities, and
      Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadets are authorized to participate in flying duties as observers, in a spe-
      cial training status, on missions as determined by the MAJCOM. HARM offices will publish AOs
      for such cadets or students. Neither flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit is authorized, nor
      will aviation service dates be established.
      1.10.1.8. (AMC) In AMC, individuals in this category are authorized to participate in any normal
      training mission provided they have a current flight physical and physiological training, Air Force
      Academy cadets will have aeronautical orders published by the academy. ROTC cadets will have
      non-interference orders published by the hosting wing’s HARM. Individuals are further required
      to complete applicable life support/egress training before flight. All personnel in this category will
      be entered on the flight authorization using Flight Authorization Duty Code XA. They are not in
      the orientation flight category. SARM offices are responsible for ensuring participants possess
      aeronautical orders, a current physical and physiological training prior to participating in flight.
      Cadets, not enrolled in an approved aviation related activity, will fly on local orientation missions
      only, IAW the basic AFI Table 1.1.
      1.10.1.9. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC cadets enrolled in
      approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively participating in such
      programs. Cadets will be placed on an AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order, authorizing flying sta-
      tus while participating in approved USAFA flying programs. Cadets will not be entered into an
      operational ARMS database, an Aviation Service Code (ASC) will not be assigned, and an Avia-
      tion Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither flying incentive pay nor OFDA credit is
      authorized.
      1.10.1.10. (Added-AMC) Qualified members performing duties as observer aircrew members
      must not occupy a pilot’s seat if other seats are available. Rated USAF observers must utilize an
      observer flight duty authorization code (i.e., XP, XN, XW, XE, etc.) if in the grade of lieutenant
      colonel and below, or senior observer flight duty authorization code (i.e., OP, ON, OW, OE, etc.)
      if in the grade of colonel and above. Pilot qualified individuals will not act as pilot in command
      nor will they log “Primary” time. All rated individuals not possessing a current AF Form 8, Certi-
      fication of Aircrew Qualification, qualification in a given aircraft MDS will log “OTHER” time
      and such flights will not qualify for OFDA credit. For all aircrew members other than senior
      observers, a letter of justification for such flight, signed by the unit commander, must be on file in
      the individual’s FRF prior to being allowed to log “Other” time in an aircraft the observer is not
      qualified in.
   1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a given mis-
   sion. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child. MAJCOMs are autho-
   rized to waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis, only when unusual conditions dictate.

1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and authorized opera-
   tional support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air Force aircraft if it is in the
   interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that controls the aircraft, the members are
   qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to qualification and, if applicable, licensed to per-
30                                                             AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     form such duties. Prior to authorizing these missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for
     a USAF aircrew member to operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft.
     For operational support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support
     personnel of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such
     duties. Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
     be approved.

NOTES:
     1. MAJCOMs will identify approval authorities in MAJCOM Supplements. Authority may be
        delegated below the MAJCOM level.
        2. If the aircrew member is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM for flying duties (such as a
           Combatant Command with a geographic area of responsibility), the Air Force air operations
           element within that organization will accomplish the MAJCOM function.
     1.11.1. (AMC) With MAJCOM/A3T approval, aircrew members in active flying positions and
     authorized personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-USAF aircraft if it is in the best interest
     of the US Government, approved by the authority that controls the aircraft, and the members are qual-
     ified and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. The Wing Commander is responsible for the
     line of duty determination.
        1.11.1.1. (Added-AMC) While performing official duties during joint exercises, AMC aircrew
        members are authorized to participate in orientation flights in aircraft belonging to the host nation.
        Commanders should insure a valid requirement exists; participation in such flights is in the best
        interest of the Air Force and authorization does not imply reciprocal flights in AMC aircraft.
        Approval for such flights is delegated to the Wing Commander of the individual receiving the
        flight, with the concurrence of the commander of the unit offering the flight.
     1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel from
     line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or API G coded
     positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member’s HARM office with a letter of justification authoriz-
     ing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force aircraft and log flying time
     IAW paragraph 3.3. HARM offices will use this letter as the source document to assign an appropriate
     aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1..
     1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize orientation
     flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are otherwise eligible
     to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not lower than wing com-
     mander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving authorities will ensure a valid
     requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate authority that controls the non-USAF air-
     craft. The approving office will clearly indicate to the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign
     government (as applicable) that acceptance of an orientation flight does not infer that the USAF/US
     Government will extend a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable)
     personnel. Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
     OFDA requirements.
     1.11.3. (AMC) Wing Commanders or equivalent level are authorized to approve orientation flights in
     non-USAF aircraft for individuals within their command.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                         31


   1.11.4. USAF Exchange Personnel. See AFI 16-107, International Personnel Exchange Program,
   for additional guidance regarding USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign air forces.
   1.11.5. (Added-AMC) Contract Carriers. The AMC Training and Commercial Air Carrier Branch
   pilots have DoD oversight of commercial carriers and may be required to fly aboard civilian commer-
   cial aircraft. When required to fly aboard DoD air carriers, these aircrew members will log “other”
   time using the “XP” crew position. OFDA or ACIP credit for individuals not otherwise entitled is not
   authorized.

1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
   1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification in the
   aircraft. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mission-design-series (MDS) occu-
   pies a pilot’s seat with a set of controls, a current and qualified instructor pilot will occupy the other
   seat. EXCEPTIONS:
       1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions dictate
       that these requirements are not practical.
       1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.
       1.12.1.3. If the crew composition requires another rated specialty (such as a weapons system
       officer).
       1.12.1.4. To accommodate established programs (for example, indoctrination and orientation pro-
       grams).
       1.12.1.5. Flight surgeons and MAJCOM-designated Flight Test Engineers who take part in flights
       in dual-controlled aircraft.
   1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified in the specific type aircraft being
   flown occupy any pilot’s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board the aircraft. For general
   officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC, IAW AF/CV msg 091724Z Apr 04.
   (NOTE: This message specifically precludes unqualified general officers from flying in the seat on
   aircraft deliveries when passengers are on board the aircraft.) EXCEPTIONS:
       1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This excep-
       tion allows passengers, who are an integral part of the mission (e.g., Pararescue, Rangers, CCT,
       SEALs, etc.) and when their presence is required by the training syllabus, to be on board the air-
       craft. During such times, a current and qualified instructor pilot will occupy the other pilot’s seat.
       1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots (including
       non-current or unqualified pilots) authorized to obtain and maintain qualification in a particular
       MDS aircraft may occupy a pilot's seat for purposes of conducting training or accomplishing mis-
       sion requirements when ACMs or MEGP are on board the aircraft.
          1.12.2.2.1. During such times, if the pilot is non-current or unqualified, a current and qualified
          instructor pilot will occupy the other pilot's seat.
          1.12.2.2.2. Pilots not authorized to obtain or maintain aircraft qualification will not occupy a
          seat with a set of controls with passengers, ACMs, or MEGP on board.

Section 1C—Flying by Military and Civilian Personnel of Foreign Nations in USAF Aircraft

1.13. Air Force Policy. The foreign military personnel listed below are authorized to take part in flights
in US Air Force aircraft. Other foreign military personnel (for example, air attachés, other representatives
of foreign air forces in Washington, D.C., Foreign Military Sales [FMS] personnel and Military Assis-
tance Program [MAP] personnel) must be advised to obtain a waiver of flying requirements from their
government for the duration of their tour in the continental United States (CONUS).
     1.13.1. Foreign officers who serve in the US Air Force under the exchange program described in AFI
     16-107, International Personnel Exchange Program (PEP), and are required to perform frequent and
     regular flights as part of their duties are given flying privileges according to this instruction.
     1.13.2. Foreign military personnel who receive flight training at Air Force training installations are
     given flying privileges that correspond to their course of training.
     1.13.3. Foreign military personnel assigned or attached to a US Air Force or a joint staff organization,
     whose duties require such flights as part of combined operations or exercises (such as Red Flag, Blue
     Flag, etc.).
     1.13.4. In overseas commands, subject to approval of the proper commander and following the com-
     mand administrative procedures, military personnel of friendly foreign nations may take part as air-
     crew members in flights of US Air Force aircraft operated by the MAJCOM, Defense Intelligence
     Agency (DIA), US Military Groups (USMILGP), Missions, and Military Assistance Advisory Groups
     (MAAG) when: the individual is physically, physiologically, professionally, and administratively
     qualified; a fully qualified US Air Force pilot occupies a pilot position during aircraft operations; and
     when required by the MAJCOMs, DIA, USMILGP, Missions, or MAAG to help complete their mis-
     sion.
     1.13.5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements,
     IAW AFI 16-201.
     1.13.6. If not otherwise provided for in this instruction, other foreign military personnel stationed at
     CONUS installations whose duties require them to fly in US Air Force aircraft must request approval
     according to paragraph 1.16.

1.14. Flight Authorizations.
     1.14.1. Air Force flying unit commanders may, within the preceding policy, authorize physically,
     physiologically, professionally, and administratively qualified military personnel of foreign nations to
     take part as aircrew members according to this instruction. Although foreign military personnel who
     take part in flying duties in US Air Force aircraft do not serve in command positions, exchange offic-
     ers, FMS personnel, and MAP trainees may serve as pilot in command of single-place, multi-place, or
     formations of aircraft provided they qualify for such duty according to the standards set for a US Air
     Force pilot.

                      AVIATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES

Section 2A—Flying Program

2.1. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. The rated officer and CEA
inventory requires close management at all levels to ensure a high state of readiness is maintained with
available resources. The authorized rated inventory includes pilots, navigators/combat systems operators
(CSO) and air battle managers in the grade of lieutenant colonel and below. To manage these as well as
other rated/CEA aircrew positions, API codes are assigned to identify these positions. NOTE: API codes
1-0 apply to all rated officers, and codes A-Z apply to CEA personnel (Table 2.1.).
   2.1.1. Until the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is modified to maintain API effective dates
   and interface this data to the ARMS database, HARM offices will enter the API effective date in
   ARMS. Upon receipt and validation of MilPDS interface API change, enter the effective date of the
   API change.

NOTES:
     1. APIs 1, 2, 9, and A are for officers and CEAs assigned to line flying positions or assigned to
        formal flying training programs. The primary duty of these crewmembers is flying.
       2. API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, C, D, and E identify crewmembers assigned to supervisory or staff positions.
          These positions require aircrew expertise (API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, D, and E) and some require active
          flying (API 6, 8, B, and D).
       3. If more than one crewmember is assigned to an API-5, 6, 8, B, and D position, only the pri-
          mary designated incumbent will be assigned an active FAC/FSC code and fly. The MAJ-
          COM/SGPA or higher will determine which flight surgeons are designated as the primary
          incumbent.
       4. If replacement of the primary incumbent is necessary (for example, PCS, permanent change
          of assignment, etc.), the replacement may also be authorized an active FAC/FSC code, pro-
          vided the overlap is not more than 30 days. (Reference para 1.4.2.1.1..)
       5. Qualified medical officers assigned to flight surgeon and pilot-physician, when not assigned
          to an operational flying squadron as a primary line flier, positions.
       6. Officers/CEAs assigned to flying positions outside of USAF or duties requiring active flying
          with foreign services.
       7. API 0 and Z identify non-rated/non-CEA positions.
       8. Do not assign an API code to separated (FSC P) or retired (FSC R) aircrew members. HARM
          offices will leave the API block on the AF Form 1887 blank for these individuals.

2.3. Aviation Service Codes (ASC ). ASCs are two-character codes that indicate incentive pay entitle-
ment and flying status. The first character of the ASC is the entitlement status code (ESC) (Table 2.3. and
Table 2.4.) and identifies Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay
(CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) entitlement status. The second character is the Flying
Status Code (FSC) and identifies the current flying status. The second character is numeric when the flier
is disqualified or suspended (see Table 2.5.) or an alpha character for qualified individuals (see Table
2.6.). Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2. indicate ACIP and CEFIP entitlement status, respectively.

NOTES:
  1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and the reason
     for inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must fly in an active sta-
     tus if otherwise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no flying support capability
     exists for these officers, assign an inactive FSC. All rated aircrew members assigned to non-flying
     duties or non-rated flying are restricted from active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign support-flying
     priorities according to paragraph 2.9. when adequate resources are lacking.
     2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
     3. Do not process non-performance AOs for rated officers after 18 years of aviation service or CEAs
        after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402 flying evaluation
        board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions who do not fly for
        extended periods for reasons within their control.
     4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the separation or
        retirement orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable). ARC members entering
        a PAS Code starting with S7 will be assigned FSC P or FSC R upon effective date of orders.
     5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position, assign FSC
        D. When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change the member's FSC
        from D to J. When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded position to a jump DAFSC (or J
        prefixed position) only, change the member's FSC to E.

2.4. Aviation Service Code (ASC), and Flying Activity Code (FAC) EffectiveDates.
NOTE: HARM offices must verify UMD information to document that aircrew/parachutists are assigned
to an authorized flying/jump position prior to publishing AOs.
   2.4.1. Flying or parachuting duties, OFDA credit, and incentive pay start on the ASC effective date.
   Incentive pay terminates the day prior to a suspension, disqualification, or termination ASC effective
   date. Assign the ASC effective date as follows:
      2.4.1.1. Use 1 June 1974 for officers rated before 1 June 1974.
      2.4.1.2. Use the individual’s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and CEAs
      entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) or approved local initial qualification train-
      ing (IQT) flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This date cannot be prior to
      member meeting qualification requirements IAW AFI 11-402.
      2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that requires an
      ASC change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend formal flying train-
      ing TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment. EXCEPTIONS:
          2.4.1.3.1. Use the day a rated officer or CEA UFT graduate signs in to the operational unit at
          the permanent base following initial qualification training to change the FSC from "X" to "A."
          2.4.1.3.2. Use the day after departing the TDY location where initial qualification was com-
          pleted to change FSC "X" to "A" when an officer/CEA UFT graduate changed base locations
          to his or her first operational duty assignment following completion of UFT, then later com-
          pleted initial qualification training at another location.
          2.4.1.3.3. Officer/CEA UFT graduates assigned to operational duty after UFT and then
          entered into in-unit or formal training leading to initial qualification in the primary aircraft will
          retain FSC X until completion of training as documented by a flight evaluation, AF Form 8,
          Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification
          (Multiple Aircraft). The unit will submit an AF Form 4324 or an AF Form 1522 (documenting
          the basic qualification) to the HARM office to publish the AO.
          2.4.1.3.4. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will maintain
          their current ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain Lopez, a rated naviga-
          tor with a current ASC of 1A is selected to attend pilot UFT. Captain Lopez has a PCS assign-
          ment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT and departs Robins AFB on 5 Sep 05. The UFT
          class-start date is 15 Sep 05. The Laughlin HARM office changes Captain Lopez’s ASC from
          1A to 1U effective 15 Sep 05.
          2.4.1.3.5. Use the date an officer/CEA completes an in-unit or formal qualification training
          course (combined UFT/MQT) at the permanent duty station, as documented by an AF Form 8/
          8a evaluation, to publish an AO to change the member’s FSC from “U” to “X.” Publish an AO
          to the change the member’s FSC from “X” to “A” effective one calendar day after the effective
          date of the AF Form 8/8a.
      2.4.1.4. Use the latest UFT graduation date to publish the ASC change from 1U to 1X (rated) or
      AU to AX (CEA). The UFT HARM office will publish the AO. For CEA UFTs without a formal
      graduation, use the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
50                                                        AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


       2.4.1.5. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating) class start
       date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for members initially
       assigned to an authorized jump ("J" prefix AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX, 1T0XX, and
       1W0XXC) UMD position. HARM offices may use TDY orders or formal training notification to
       jump school to process initial AO prior to the member attending training.
          2.4.1.5.1. HARM offices will publish AOs for parachutists to attend HALO (High Altitude
          Low Opening) school prior to the member attending school, effective the class start date.
          Member must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and AOs must specify the type
          of pay (HALO). HALO pay will not start until the member performs a HALO jump. Once the
          member performs a HALO jump, HALO pay is authorized from effective date of the AO for-
          ward (if otherwise qualified). If the member does not complete the course, HALO pay termi-
          nates on the day the member is disenrolled from class. A new AO must be published effective
          the day after disenrollment to reinstate Static Line HDIP (if member returns to previous jump
          duty) or previous ASC held (prior to the class).
          2.4.1.5.2. For members approved to attend a formal jump course prior to an approved assign-
          ment (PCS or PCA) to a "J" prefixed AFSC or jump inherent DAFSC, the HARM office will
          publish an AO authorizing jump status effective the class start date. HARM offices will pro-
          cess an AO assigning ASC 06 effective one day after the course completion date. Member's
          gaining HARM office will publish an AO authorizing active jump status again, once the mem-
          ber is officially assigned to the billet.
NOTE: This is authorized only for members retraining, possessing an authorized jump inherent AFSC,
or pending an assignment to a "J" coded position. AOs/HDIP are not authorized for members who are not
approved to be assigned to a full-time, active jump position.
       2.4.1.6. Use the duty effective date for a change in duty that does not involve PCS but requires an
       ASC change (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). For example: Member
       assigned to an inactive position approved for a Flying Activity Code (FAC) waiver to support a
       contingency or date a commander directs suspension/disqualification IAW AFI 11-402.
          2.4.1.6.1. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification or requalifica-
          tion course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM office will publish an
          AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A effective on the class start date. For inactive aircrew
          deploying to positions requiring active flying, the HARM office will validate the requirement
          to fly utilizing the member’s deployment order and publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC
          A for the duration of the deployment, effective on the member’s report date or the member’s
          training/requalification start date, whichever is earlier. All other uses of FAC 6/E must be
          approved by AF/A3O-A (see Table 2.2.).
       2.4.1.7. For rated officers/CEAs required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency actions
       officer, combat rescue officer, mission crew commander, RP, IIO, or other duties that do not fall
       under the operational support program, use the effective and termination dates of the duty orders
       to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates upon completion of flying duties. Rated or CEA personnel
       not already receiving ACIP or CEFIP are eligible to receive HDIP IAW AFI 11-421 for the duty
       period (if otherwise qualified); OFDA, ACIP and CEFIP are not authorized for these duties. Do
       not change the ASC for a rated officer or CEA. Assign ASC 9C for non-rated/non-CEA members
       who perform this duty.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                      51


       2.4.1.8. Use the effective date of the new API code for a change from inactive flying status to
       active flying status or vice versa.
       2.4.1.9. Rated officers. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 12, 18, 22 (if appli-
       cable), and 25 years of aviation service when passing an OFDA milestone.
       2.4.1.10. CEAs. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 10, 15, 20, or 25 years of
       aviation service, when passing an OFDA milestone.
       2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Publish AOs only for individuals assigned to authorized permanent
       (UMD "J" prefix or DAFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) positions, on temporary or
       permissive jump status, or for USAFA cadets enrolled in approved jump programs. Process com-
       mander requests to initiate jump status IAW AFI 11-410. Process disqualification requests IAW
       AFI 11-402.
           2.4.1.11.1. The AO effective date will be the date the member is assigned to a designated Unit
           Manpower Document (UMD) position that requires active jump status ("J" prefix DAFSC or
           AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 without a PCS change, or the
           date a member is authorized attachment to another US military unit requiring active parachute
           duty. The HARM office publishes AOs, assigning ASC 9E for jump duty only or 9D if the
           member is assigned to duty that requires both aircrew and parachutist qualification IAW AFI
           11-401. The AO must specify type of jump duty required and pay authorized.
NOTE: HARM offices will not assign ASC 9E for rated officers or CEAs who already have an active
FSC assigned. In such cases, include a statement in the remarks section of the AO that member is assigned
to parachute duty and a "J" prefixed UMD DAFSC and the type of jumping/pay authorized. Do not assign
an ASC to permissive jumpers. See also Table 2.6., Note 5.
           2.4.1.11.2. For an officer/enlisted member qualified for parachutist service who is authorized
           temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date established in the
           commander’s request letter and with a termination date not to exceed 180 days. For example,
           a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a “J” coded UMD position is approved to pro-
           vide manning assistance on a Joint Readiness Exercise from 19 Jul 05 through 23 Sep 05. The
           HARM office would publish an AO effective 19 July 05, with a termination date of 23 Sep 05.
           AO remarks will reference approval letter justification.
           2.4.1.11.3. For an officer/enlisted member authorized permissive jump status IAW AFI
           11-410, publish an AO with a start date established in the commander’s request letter; the ter-
           mination date will not exceed 12 months. Do not change the ASC or authorize HDIP.
           2.4.1.11.4. If a parachutist reenlists without a break in service, publish a new AO to change
           only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge creditable months
           continue through this period.
           2.4.1.11.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (static/HALO). Member must
           be required to perform HALO duty to be eligible for the HALO incentive pay rate. This
           includes attending HALO school (reference paragraph 2.4.1.5.1.). If a member is in a
           HALO-authorized manning position and departs PCS to a position that does not require
           HALO jumping, publish a new AO authorizing static jumping/pay only.
           2.4.1.11.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD parachutist
           position ("J" prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410

          to assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump requirement terminated) at the same duty
          location. This includes members who retrain out of parachutist duties or members who are
          assigned to a unit that has no available jump authorizations (manning in excess of total UMD
          authorizations).
NOTE: Publish an AO to reflect the termination date of parachute duty only for members with flight
requirements or an established ASC (rated/CEA).
          2.4.1.11.7. Use the day after departed last duty station or jump school for members who PCS
          to a base without an available UMD parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX,
          1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the parachutist from parachute duty
          and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
          2.4.1.11.8. HARM offices will publish AOs for USAFA cadets and other approved Air Force
          members participating in jump related duties as part of the USAFA Airmanship Program. Use
          the effective date of entry to the USAFA Airmanship Program. The effective period of the AO
          authorizing parachutist service is limited to the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign
          an aviation service code. Leave the ASC section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit nor
          jump incentive pay are authorized.
       2.4.1.12. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members. The effective period of
       an AO authorizing aviation service as a non-rated aircrew member is limited by the member’s
       duty availability. The member must be assigned to an aircrew-prefixed manpower position on the
       UMD. For members initially beginning aviation status, the AO effective date is the date the mem-
       ber is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a formal school where in-flight duties (not
       observation) are part of the course curriculum. Example: On 1 Jun 05, a member reported to the
       base for aircrew duty. On 15 Jun 05, the commander certified eligibility and assigned the member
       to an aircrew-prefixed manpower position on the UMD. On 1 Jul 05, the member commenced
       TDY to begin formal flying training. The initial AO effective date is 1 July 05. For in-unit initial
       training, the AO is effective when formal in-flight flying training begins after being assigned to an
       authorized aircrew position within a unit. For example: On 1 May 05, a member reported to a base
       for aircrew duty. On 15 May 05, the commander certified eligibility, assigned the member to the
       appropriate UMD aircrew prefixed DAFSC, and notified the HARM office of in-flight training
       start date. On 20 May 05, the member began formal in-unit flying training. The AO effective date
       is 20 May 05; however, the initial training must lead toward initial qualification.
          2.4.1.12.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA inactive aircrew members assigned to an active
          flying position at the gaining unit, HARM offices will assign ASC 9D (Active Non-rated Air-
          crew Member) effective one day after member departed last duty station, providing the mem-
          ber is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew
          "X," "K," or "Q" UMD DAFSC position, not occupied by another active flyer. If there was no
          PCS involved, use the effective date of duty (if otherwise qualified). See AFI 11-402 for limi-
          tations on exceeding UMD manpower authorizations for non-rated/non-CEA aircrew posi-
          tions.
          2.4.1.12.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer assigned to an
          authorized aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" prefixed UMD manpower position to terminate aviation
          service and assign ASC 9J (Inactive-Restricted). This paragraph also applies to members
          approved for retraining.

           2.4.1.12.3. If a non-rated aircrew member reenlists without a break in service, publish a new
           AO to change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge cred-
           itable months continue through this period.
       2.4.1.13. Operational Support Members. IAW AFI 11-402, use the effective date when
       man-months are authorized, not to exceed a one-month period.

2.5. Operational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under competent orders
while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the performance of assigned duties.
The Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, and the FY
1996 National Defense Authorization Act established months of operational flying duty accumulation
(OFDA) required for entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation ser-
vice. Current legal authority is established in the US Code. Table 2.7. shows OFDA requirements for each
of the establishing acts.

2.6. Transition Status Codes (TSC). Transition Status Codes were established to track the OFDA
requirements for rated officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career
Improvement Act of 1989, and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. Table 2.8. lists and
defines TSCs. Figure 2.3. provides a timeline chart based on aviation service dates and provides addi-
tional guidance to aid in determining a member’s TSC. Table 2.9. shows OFDA requirements based on
the member’s TSC.

NOTES:
  1. Aircrew members assigned TSC "D" or "E" are grandfathered under the ACIA of 1974.
     2. Aircrew members assigned TSC "A" require 96 months OFDA at 12 years to receive continuous
        pay until 18 years, and 120 or 144 months OFDA at 18 years to receive continuous ACIP until 22
        years or 25 years respectively.
     3. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who accumulated
        at least 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC "C".
                Example A. If a member in this status accumulated 72-107 months OFDA as of 1 Oct
                1991, he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 18 years.
                Example B. If the member accumulated 108-131 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she
                was entitled to continuous ACIP until 22 years.
                Example C. If the member accumulated at least 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/
                she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 25 years.

            Example D. Members assigned TSC "C" with less than 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct
            1991, were reviewed again at 18 years to determine appropriate incentive pay action.
  4. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who accumulated
     less than 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, were assigned TSC "B."
            Example A. Members assigned TSC "B," with an ASD of 2 Oct 1979 – 9 Feb 1984 inclu-
            sive, require 108 months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18
            years.
            Example B. Members assigned TSC “B,” with an ASD of 10 Feb 1984 or after, require 96
            months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18 years.
            Example C. Members assigned TSC “B” who did not meet the 12-year requirement, but
            accumulated at least 72 months OFDA at the 12-year point, were assigned ASC “5Y” and
            were reviewed again at the 15-year point.

NOTES:
  1. If at 12 years of aviation service the individual accumulated 72 months of OFDA, but less than 96
     or 108 months, his or her ASC changed to "5Y" conditional status until 15 years of aviation ser-
     vice. This flagged in ARMS that the individual OFDA status needed to be reviewed in the 15th
     year of aviation service. If the individual accumulated 96 or 108 months (based on the member’s
     12-year requirement) of OFDA by the 15th year of aviation service, he or she received continuous
     ACIP until the 18th year of aviation service and his or her ASC changed to "2Y." If the individual
     accumulated less than 96 or 108 months (12-year requirement) of OFDA, he or she remained in
     conditional status ASC "5Y" until 18 years of aviation service, when HARM offices again
     reviewed the individual’s OFDA status.
     2. Individuals in this category were grandfathered to the OFDA requirements under the ACIA of
        1974, although they had not reached the 12th or 18th year of aviation service, if they met the
        OFDA requirements of 72, 108, and 132 months on 1 October 1991. Otherwise, they must have
        met the OFDA requirements listed above at 18 years of aviation service. When an individual
        reached their 12th or 18th year of aviation service, they received the appropriate entitlement status
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        57


       code. If individuals had not met the required OFDA for continuous ACIP, they entered condi-
       tional status.
              Example A. If an individual accumulated 72 months of OFDA, but less than 108 months
              on 1 October 1991, he or she received continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation ser-
              vice. However, at the 18th year of aviation service the member must have met the revised
              criteria of 120 and 144 months OFDA under the ACIA of 1989 to be paid continuous
              ACIP through 22 and 25 years of aviation service.
              Example B. If an individual accumulated 108 months of OFDA, but less than 132 months
              on 1 October 1991, he or she received continuous ACIP through 22 years of aviation ser-
              vice. However, at the 18th year of aviation service they must have met the 144 months of
              OFDA requirement under the ACIA of 1989 to be paid continuous ACIP through 25 years
              of aviation service.
              Example C. If an individual accumulated 132 months of OFDA on 1 October 1991, he or
              she received continuous ACIP until 25 years of aviation service. When an individual
              reached their 12th or 18th year of aviation service, they received the appropriate entitlement
              status code required at that time. If individuals did not meet the required OFDA for contin-
              uous ACIP, they entered conditional status.
   3. Individuals with TSCs D and E were totally grandfathered under the ACIA of 1974 and were
      required to meet the requirements above for continuous ACIP. If TSC D and E individuals did
      not meet the required OFDA for continuous ACIP they entered conditional status.

2.7. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the award of
operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active operational fliers
(FSC A) who fail to perform flying duties to a temporary status, FSC S (Inactive-Nonperformance) effec-
tive the first day of the fourth month of inactivity. FSC S will remain valid until: the member accom-
plishes an OFDA-creditable flight; is disqualified for Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non-flying
duty. Active rated officers and CEAs recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical avail-
ability date and code. When the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for 30 days,
ARMS automatically reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Manage-
ment System interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.) An AO change is not nec-
essary. Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S applies.
   2.7.1. As defined by public law, operational flying duty is flying performed under competent orders
   by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills are normally
   maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and fly-
   ing performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.
   Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as a minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mis-
   sion or support aircraft. One of the following indicates the need to fly:
       2.7.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
       2.7.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
       2.7.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances dictate.
   2.7.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members, other than
   flight surgeons and UFT students, is based upon the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Avia-
58                                                          AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     tion Career Improvement Act of 1989, the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and
     the FY 99 NDAA. These acts established the criteria to determine eligibility for ACIP. The require-
     ment to track flight activity of CEAs is based upon the FY 00 NDAA. Title 37 US Code, Chapter 5,
     Article 301a provides current public law guidance on ACIP and OFDA requirements.
        2.7.2.1. The 1974 Act set standards of minimum experience necessary to receive ACIP: at least
        72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 12th year of aviation service and
        108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 18th year of aviation service. Individuals meeting
        these requirements were, if otherwise qualified (medically and physiologically [if applicable]),
        entitled to continuous ACIP until the 22nd year of officer service (using an individual's OSD),
        without meeting a specific flying performance standard. Members who completed at least 132
        months (11 years) of operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service received, if otherwise
        qualified, continuous entitlement to ACIP until the 25th year of officer service. Those who failed
        to meet the standards were conditionally entitled to ACIP only through a minimum performance
        standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) while
        assigned to operational flying duties. In addition, rated officers with over 25 years of officer ser-
        vice (grade O-6 and below) and assigned to operational flying positions were eligible to receive
        conditional ACIP.
        2.7.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve for ACIP
        entitlement. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 108 months (9 years), 120
        months (10 years), and 144 months (12 years) from the previous requirements of 72 months (6
        years), 108 months (9 years), and 132 months (11 years). The effective date for the new criteria
        was 1 October 1991. On 1 October 1991, the USAF began transition to the new requirement struc-
        ture and rated members were assigned Transition Status Codes (TSC) in order to determine OFDA
        requirements. Rated officers with ASDs of 1 October 1985 and later were required to meet the 9,
        10, and 12-year OFDA requirements under the ACIA of 1989.
        2.7.2.3. The FY 96 NDAA modified the requirements rated officers must achieve for ACIP enti-
        tlement established by the 1989 Act. The new law established revised OFDA requirements for
        rated members who completed, or would complete, 12 years of aviation service on or after 10 Feb
        1996. Rated members assigned TSC A must have accumulated 8 years or more of OFDA months
        within their first 12 years of aviation service to qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of
        aviation service. Rated members who completed 12 or more years of aviation service prior to 10
        Feb 1996 must have accumulated at least 9 years of OFDA within their first 12 years of aviation
        service to qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
        did not meet the applicable standard for entitlement to continuous ACIP remained entitled to con-
        ditional ACIP contingent upon meeting the monthly flying hour requirement.
        2.7.2.4. The FY 99 NDAA changed the way ACIP entitlement was computed for all rated offic-
        ers. Previously, eligibility determination was based on the anniversary of the Officer Service Date
        (OSD). The FY 99 NDAA changed eligibility determination to the anniversary of the ASD. This
        change did not apply to those aviators who had passed 22 or 25 years of OSD and had ACIP ter-
        minated under the ACIA of 1974.
NOTE: See AFI 11-402 for guidance regarding aviation service dates.
        2.7.2.5. The FY 00 NDAA set minimum experience levels required for CEAs to receive continu-
        ous CEFIP: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 10th year of
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                         59


       aviation service, 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 15th year of aviation service, and
       168 months (14 years) completed by the 20th year of aviation service. CEAs who meet these
       requirements and are medically, professionally and, if required, physiologically qualified, are enti-
       tled to continuous CEFIP until their 25th year of aviation service and without regard to a specific
       flying performance standard. Members who fail to meet standards for entitlement to continuous
       CEFIP are entitled to conditional CEFIP if they are assigned to active operational flying duties and
       perform aircrew duties an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) until
       they reach their next aviation service requirement point.
   2.7.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
       2.7.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid flying
       duties which are authorized OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three months.
       2.7.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A, U, X, or Z
       for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit from the current month
       or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members assigned to an active flying billet pend-
       ing a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should sign out from the losing base after the 15th day
       of the month in order to receive OFDA credit for that month. They must have also performed
       OFDA-creditable flying within three months of the departure month.
       2.7.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of aviation
       service for career enlisted aviators. NOTE: If required, members may accumulate badge-credit-
       able OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18th or 20th year of aviation service.
       See AFI 11-402.
       2.7.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or returning to such duty from a dis-
       qualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the date of assignment of
       an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of that date, the HARM office
       will retroactively change the active FSC to FSC S, effective the day following the date of initial
       assignment of the active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit which began accruing with assignment of the
       original active FSC and terminate entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying
       begins, effective two months before the date of the first flight. OFDA credit resumes from that
       date. EXAMPLE: Captain Wiggins is assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17 April:
       On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to FSC S, effective 20 December. Captain Wiggins
       accumulated three months OFDA credit for January, February, and March. (Do not credit Decem-
       ber because Capt Wiggins was assigned an active FSC for less than 15 days during that month.)
       The FSC S action deducts the three months credited and stops further accumulation. On 17 April,
       change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17 February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit.
       Do not award OFDA credit for February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit for March
       and April. Credit continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform for a period greater
       than three months.
NOTE: Non-performance does not apply to CEAs prior to 1 Oct 99; however, CEAs who were on active
flying status as of 1 Oct 99 are considered "initially assigned to flying duties (FSC A)" effective 1 Oct 99.
The guidance in this paragraph applies. EXAMPLE: SSgt Harris, a flight engineer, was assigned ASC 9D
from 5 Sep 94 through 30 Sep 99. Effective 1 Oct 99, her ASC was changed from 9D to AA. Her first
flight after initial assignment to FSC A was 15 Feb 00. Therefore, the HARM office published an AO to
change her ASC from AA to AS (Inactive-Nonperformance) effective 2 Oct 99, the day after her initial
60                                                             AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


assignment to FSC A. The HARM office then published a subsequent AO to change SSgt Harris’ FSC
from S to FSC A effective 15 Dec 99, two months prior to the date of her first flight.
        2.7.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated) and 20
        years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month following the month
        in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to "S" effective the first day of the fourth
        month following the month in which flying duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit.
        Change the FSC to "A" again effective the date of the member’s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do
        not award retroactive credit. EXAMPLE: Lt Ostrowski flew on 14 May and did not fly again until
        18 November: The HARM office assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June,
        July, and August. The HARM office changes the FSC back to "A" on 18 November. There is no
        OFDA credit for November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15 days during
        that month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.

2.8. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are established by
public law: Title 37, U.S. Code, Chapter 5. IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments, it is Air Force policy that as
many rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months) of operational flying by the 18th
year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the requirements to receive ACIP through 25
years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy is to manage CEAs to complete at least 9 years (108
months) of operational flying by the 15th year of aviation service; not all CEAs will fulfill the require-
ments to receive CEFIP through 25 years of aviation service. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of
1989 and FY 00 NDAA authorized the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements
for rated officers and CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their
control. Each year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below
and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and
selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the following pro-
cedures apply:
     2.8.1. Rated officers assigned TSCs A, B, C, and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waivers. Because TSC
     D and E rated officers were grandfathered to the pre-ACIA of 1989 OFDA requirements, they are not
     eligible for waivers. Candidate rated officers must have at least 72 months (6 years) of OFDA credit
     to apply for a waiver. CEAs must accomplish at least 60 months (5 years) of operational flying during
     the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96 months (8 years) of operational flying duties during the first
     15 years of aviation service to apply for a waiver. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the
     minimum number of months shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration. By direction of
     the SECAF, third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation
     service when OFDA requirements have not been met, will not be considered.
        2.8.1.1. When retroactive waivers are approved by SECAF for rated officers who obtain 72
        months of OFDA credit after the 12th of aviation service, members will be authorized continuous
        entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months credit. (Members are not
        qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting qualification requirements.) EXAMPLE:
        Major Farrell reached his 12th year of aviation service on 18 January 04 and had accumulated 60
        months of OFDA credit, 36 months short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A,
        conditional entitlement status. Effective 17 January 05 he accumulated 72 months of OFDA and
        applied for a waiver of his 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved a 24-month
        OFDA waiver on 15 June 05 and Major Farrell’s HARM office was directed to publish an AO
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       61


     changing Major Farrell’s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17 January 05.
     NOTE: CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.
     2.8.1.2. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and approved by
     SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized continuous entitlement to
     ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if otherwise qualified).
     2.8.1.3. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and approved by
     SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized entitlement to ACIP or
     CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to the first office in the member’s
     MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise qualified). See also paragraph 2.8.9..
  2.8.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the member failed
  to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Examples include, but are not lim-
  ited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers assigned to deactivating/draw down
  flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who cannot be placed into another flying position prior
  to completion of 120 months of OFDA credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to
  non-flying duties necessary to comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty
  schools/follow-on tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets
  to perform UAS sensor operator duties.
     2.8.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments merit
     OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible for rated offic-
     ers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such assignments jeopardize the
     achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate documentation in the member’s personnel
     record. Documentation will include reasons why the member was assigned to a non-flying posi-
     tion (see paragraph 2.8.7.).
  2.8.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA waivers.
  2.8.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (inactive--lack of support) do not
  meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing draw down
  or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual’s specialty was not required (i.e., an F-4 navigator
  assigned to a unit converting to single-place fighters), or when the unit aircraft was operationally
  grounded (paragraph 1.3.2.). Individuals must meet both K code and draw down, conversion, or
  grounding criteria to be considered for a waiver.
  2.8.5. Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second OFDA waiver.
  2.8.6. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non-flying
  position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not eligible for
  OFDA waivers (except as provided for in paragraph 2.8.2.1.). When an individual declines an oppor-
  tunity to fly and is selected for a non-flying assignment, document this action in the member’s person-
  nel record, as specified in paragraph 2.8.7.. Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
  2.8.7. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document that the
  above situations existed at the time of assignment to establish an audit trail. (MAJCOMs will verify
  flying status code K criteria.) This may then be used to verify why OFDA waiver candidates were
  unable to accomplish OFDA requirements.
  2.8.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and
  below and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to HQ AF/DPO, and for
62                                                          AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     CMSgts (and selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted, MAJCOM commanders may
     deny requests.
     2.8.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the year prior to
     loss of flight pay. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM. For members assigned to Head-
     quarters, USAF, submit waivers through the individual’s supervisory chain of command (A1, A3, A4,
     etc.), then to A3O-AT, DPO, or DPE; submit waivers for Colonels to AF/CVA prior to routing to AF/
     DPO. For members not assigned to an Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members assigned to organizations
     such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM), individuals will submit packages to their
     servicing Air Force HARM office, which will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM
     office’s chain of command. As a minimum, the submission will include the member’s dated request
     letter, Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military Personnel Data System
     duty history (SURF), and any other documents to support justification. MAJCOMs will coordinate
     with AFPC to ensure support for packages when waivers are based on assignment actions. Packages
     forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must also contain MAJCOM/CC (or equivalent) indorsement.
     It is the responsibility of the member submitting the OFDA waiver request to establish adequate justi-
     fication for waiver consideration.
        2.8.9.1. HARM offices will review the package for accuracy and validate eligibility criteria IAW
        this instruction. Review ARMS data/member’s FRF to validate TSC code. Do not forward OFDA
        waiver request packages for members with TSC D or E. See also paragraph 2.8.1..
        2.8.9.2. Commanders ensure eligible members submit waiver packages within the year prior to
        the applicable aviation service point for which the member requests an OFDA waiver.
            2.8.9.2.1. If a rated officer requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the package dur-
            ing: (a) the 11th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 12-year requirement or (b) the
            17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 18 year/120-month requirement.
            2.8.9.2.2. If a CEA requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the package during: (a)
            the 9th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 10-year requirement or (b) the 14th year of
            aviation service for a waiver of the 15 year/108-month requirement.
     2.8.10. Eligibility criteria for Air Battle Manager OFDA waivers. In order to be considered, an
     ABM must meet all of the following criteria.
        2.8.10.1. In addition to using existing criteria in rated directives, an ABM must be eligible for
        Aviation Career Incentive Pay as specified in AF/A3/5 message dated 2 Oct 99 (Subj: Rating Air
        Battle Managers), and have an established Aviation Service Date.
        2.8.10.2. Must comply with provisions of paragraph 2.8. above.
        2.8.10.3. The following ABM duties that commenced after the establishment of the ASD may
        count toward an OFDA waiver on a month-to-month equivalent (not to exceed the minimum
        OFDA requirement at the applicable aviation service point) if the member was assigned and per-
        formed primary duties as a combat mission ready/basic mission capable crewmember at a Ground
        Theater Air Control System or Air Defense unit with an assigned operational wartime mission
        (Designed Operational Capability), was formally attached to one of these line units and counted
        toward its SORTS rating, or performed formal course instructor duties at undergraduate air battle
        manager training. Crewmember positions include: Air Weapons Officer/Director, Senior Director,
        Air Surveillance Officer, Interface Control Officer, or Mission Crew Commander.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       63


       2.8.10.4. After the ASD and prior to 1 Oct 99, an ABM on aviation orders and receiving Hazard-
       ous Duty Incentive Pay may credit the entire month toward OFDA requirements if the individual
       performed ABM primary operational flying duty at least one day within that same month (not to
       exceed the minimum OFDA requirement at the applicable aviation service point).
   2.8.11. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria. AF/
   A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all offices con-
   cur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to SECAF for consideration
   of an OFDA waiver. Packages that do not meet eligibility criteria will be returned to the MAJCOM.
   Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months required.
   2.8.12. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is consid-
   ered for a waiver.
       2.8.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (A3) and Person-
       nel Staff (A1) to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and laws. MAJCOMs will
       coordinate with AFPC/AFCMO to ensure support for packages when waivers are based on assign-
       ment actions. Each submission must include the items specified in paragraph 2.8.9., above.
       2.8.12.1. (AMC) Forward OFDA waiver requests with rationale through command channels to
       HQ AMC/A3TF. HQ AMC/A3TF will coordinate the request through HQ AMC/A1 and HQ
       AMC/A3.
       2.8.12.2. Prior to MAJCOM/CC approval, MAJCOMs may send OFDA waiver packages to AF/
       A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for an informal review. MAJCOMs will provide the initial review
       function. If the package needs revision, MAJCOMs will accomplish this prior to submission to
       HAF agencies. If requested, AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will provide a recommendation
       to the submitting MAJCOM staff with an assessment of the validity of each case.
   2.8.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA waiver
   packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to AF/A3O-AT, AF/
   DPO, or AF/DPE for processing and final action.

2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active rated fly-
ing to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills. If certain SECAF approved mis-
sion requirements are more than the number of such officers locally assigned, a minimum number of other
qualified members of the authorized rated inventory may also be assigned rated aircrew duties.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.9.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
       2.9.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.9.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
       2.9.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3 or 4, or
       non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the most recent avi-
       ation service date, if:
           2.9.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12 months
           at short tour bases).
64                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


            2.9.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission specifically
            designated by HQ USAF.
        2.9.1.5. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
        TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official aircrew
        duties.
     2.9.2. Special Circumstances.
        2.9.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary (365 days or less) operational flying
        that is not IAW paragraph 2.9.1., AF/A3O-A may approve exceptions on an individual case basis
        (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2.
        2.9.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight non-rated or
        non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8. For rated officers who
        were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J, and include in the remarks section
        of AO: "Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight non-rated (or non-crew) duties." Officers per-
        forming non-rated duties will log aircrew certification code "Z" on the AFTO Form 781; flight
        time does not count towards OFDA or ACIP entitlement.
     2.9.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction course of
     180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members.
     2.9.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated positions
     (API 3 or API 4).
        2.9.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TS (with copies to AF/
        REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
        2.9.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a copy to AF/
        A3O-AT) for approval.

2.10. Flight Surgeon Flying Policy.
     2.10.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified, physiolog-
     ically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive conditional ACIP,
     active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower document (UMD) position with
     Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on
     active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a, Mil-
     itary Pay Policy and Procedures - Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers
     and qualify for entitlement to conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational
     flying hours per month.
        2.10.1.1. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API coded “0” position, the HARM office will
        terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Inactive flight surgeons may be
        authorized to fly and log time without ACIP on a noninterference basis with unit training and fly-
        ing schedules. Flight surgeons not qualified in an aircraft, on inactive AOs, will log only “Other”
        flight time and include remarks on the reverse side of AFTO Form 781 (for example, “Inactive
        flight surgeon,” or “Flight surgeon not qualified in aircraft”). Paragraphs 2.16.3. through 2.16.5.
        apply.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        65


   2.10.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an API 5
   flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a pilot-physician
   or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405. Pilot-physicians/navigator-physicians assigned to active fly-
   ing positions (API 1/2) fly as line pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5 authorizes exceptions upon request,
   based on justification provided by the Surgeon General (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot
   or navigator ratings are entitled to conditional ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when
   members are assigned to API 1/2 positions.
   2.10.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes proce-
   dures for the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain conditional fliers for
   ACIP entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above, active flying pilot-physicians
   will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC 48VX. Retain members in ASC 8
   beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and
   flight surgeon ratings (only when member is assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
   2.10.4. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive flight
   surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
       2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are authorized to log
       crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions based on their aircraft qualifi-
       cation.
       2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to perform
       CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary time on these mis-
       sions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are onboard. When authorized,
       the member's HARM office will process the operational support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include
       AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ
       and non-crew HDIP authorized." The member's ASC remains ASC 8J.

2.11. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
   2.11.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.11.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying training
       instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), etc.
       2.11.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.11.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
       2.11.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded
       API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the basis of the most
       recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall short of meeting OFDA
       credit.
   2.11.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic instruction
   course of 90 days or more.
   2.11.3. Crewmembers will not perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
   TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official aircrew duties.
   2.11.4. If special circumstances require active temporary (365 days or less) flying that is not IAW
   paragraph 2.11.1., AF/A3O-A may approve exceptions on an individual case basis (FAC E waiver).
66                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


2.12. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircrew Members and Non-CEA Enlisted Air-
crew Members.
     2.12.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified personnel
     assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated aircrew members are included onboard aircraft
     when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. This is their
     full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not required, operational support flying may be applicable
     (see paragraph 2.12.2.). Non-rated aircrew members will maintain flying class III physicals.
        2.12.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), K
        (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
        2.12.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an AFSC
        prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F (Flight Test), K
        (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
            2.12.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned to an
            authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C prefix) or a
            Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not remove the authori-
            zation to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the individual’s AO: “Member occupies
            an X (or J) prefix UMD position.”
            2.12.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not assigned to
            active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement to incentive pay.
     2.12.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to perform
     essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-rated aircrew
     members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties on an occasional basis.
     However, their assigned full-time duties do not require them to be onboard the aircraft to accomplish
     its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly terminates, flight record responsibility
     ends. Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational
     support flying IAW AFI 11-402.
     2.12.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams (DAFSC
     4M0X1), and non-aircrew aeromedical technicians (DAFSCs 42GX and 4N0XXs) are authorized to
     participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference basis. HARM offices will publish AOs
     according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are
     authorized. Personnel who provide high altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty
     Incentive Pay (HDIP). Paragraphs 2.16.3. through 2.16.5. apply. Personnel who fly in support of high
     altitude airdrop missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
     2.12.4. Other non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g., administrative
     duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for classified documents,
     crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination or points enroute and other
     duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11-402) may have AOs published according to
     this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Individuals in these categories will fly on a non-interference
     basis. Neither flying incentive pay nor OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraphs 2.16.3. and 2.16.5.
     apply.
        2.12.4.1. Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781
        (see paragraph 1.6.2.2.), except for those members specified in paragraph 3.3.1.5.2.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        67


       2.12.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the flying envi-
       ronment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or irregular basis (Com-
       manders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and supervisory personnel) may do so
       under the guidelines of paragraph 1.6.. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander
       positions may log flying time IAW paragraph 3.3.1.5.2..
       2.12.4.3. (Added-AMC) Flight Managers will be placed on non-interference Aeronautical
       Orders only for the time they are on a mission. Flight Managers will obtain medical clearance
       from the Flight Surgeon’s Office prior to publication of the AOs. Physiological training is not
       required. The Flight Managers will complete plane side egress and life support training which will
       be documented in the remarks of the AFTO IMT 781. Flying time and training is not authorized to
       be logged or updated in ARMS.
   2.12.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly under orien-
   tation flight guidelines of paragraph 1.9.4.7..
   2.12.6. Performance of flying duties is not authorized while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
   TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless individuals are required to perform their official
   aircrew duties.
   2.12.7. UAS sensor operators are authorized to participate in UAS aircraft flights as non-aircrew
   members. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives
   authorizing the performance of sensor operator duties. Neither HDIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are
   authorized. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor operator positions may log flying time
   IAW paragraph 3.3.1.5.3..

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.13. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated officers and
CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively fly.

2.14. Supervisory Flying.
   2.14.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate rated staff
   officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying operations of the orga-
   nization. Although occasional indoctrination flights normally maintain inactive rated staff officers
   and career enlisted aviators at an acceptable level of experience for their jobs, it is Air Force policy
   that key supervisors must actively maintain their basic flying skills to provide them with expert aware-
   ness of the unit mission.
   2.14.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission aircraft inven-
   tory (PMAI) associated with the position. When PMAI resources are not available or not practical to
   use, and maintenance of flying skills is mandatory, perform supervisory flying in the most cost-effec-
   tive aircraft available.
   2.14.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA supervi-
   sory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate API 6, 8, B, or D positions only
   when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating authorities are:
       2.14.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational flying posi-
       tions. Revisions to general officer operational flying positions require the Chief of Staff's
68                                                       AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


       approval. MAJCOMs are not authorized to make adjustments without the Chief of Staff’s
       approval. MAJCOMs desiring to upgrade indoctrination fliers to operational status must submit a
       request for a change of status to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will coordinate changes with AF/DPG. All
       requests for general officer operational flying training must be coordinated with AF/DPG.
       2.14.3.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3TF publishes the CONUS C-21 OSA General Officer flying list.
       The SARM that the General Officer is formally attached to is responsible for tracking of the Gen-
       eral Officers C-21 training events. EX: General Kohler is formally attached to the 311th AS at
       Peterson AFB and flies the C-21 with the 458th AS at Scott AFB. The SARM at Peterson AFB is
       responsible to also track flying training on the C-21 that General Kohler flew on at Scott.

Table 2.10. General Officer Flying Positions.
The following general officer positions are authorized operational or indoctrination flying
positions (as shown) when filled by USAF general officers. Individuals flying operationally must
accomplish Form 8 qualification to include instrument qualification and must maintain a
minimum of BAQ status.

The following general officer positions are authorized operational or indoctrination flying
positions (as shown) when filled by USAF general officers. Individuals flying operationally must
accomplish Form 8 qualification to include instrument qualification and must maintain a
minimum of BAQ status.

NOTES:
            1. Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes expeditionary
               flying wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
            2. Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained on file
               in AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer opera-
               tional flying positions.
        2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by forwarding
        AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for review and approval (see
        AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel flying positions will be limited to
        individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying operations, flight safety, standardization/evalua-
        tion programs, and operational readiness inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full
        time flying, there may be justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying
        program.
        2.14.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below rated
        officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the position requires an
        AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally, API 8/D positions (NAF/
        FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety, inspector general, and standardization/eval-
        uation functional areas in which flying is a requirement associated with the position. On occasion,
        justification may exist for an aircrew member to fly while in inactive status; see paragraph 2.17.

2.15. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API 6, 8, B,
and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of support) and when ade-
quate support will not be available within six months. Where practical, convert such positions to API 3, 4,
C or E.
2.15. (AMC) Submit all Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) for API 6, 8, B and D positions thru
Manpower and Organization Division (HQ AMC/A1), 402 Scott Dr., Unit 1A1, SCOTT AFB, IL
62225-5302, coordinate through HQ AMC/A3T and appropriate MAJCOM/A3 for review. These ACRs
must be accompanied by an AF IMT 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, fully justifying rated
expertise in supervisory positions. Base active (API 6/8) or inactive (API 3/4) flying status solely on job
requirements, not on individual needs or aircraft support capability.
     2.15.1. (Added-AMC) HARMs will review all API 6, 8, B or D flyers in inactive status due to lack
     of support (FSC “K”) every six months. The HARM will audit the Unit Manpower Document or other
     source document to verify these positions. Forward the names of inactive API 6, 8, B or D to HQ
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                           71


   AMC/A3TF, 402 Scott Drive, Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL 62225-5302 to be considered for conversion to
   API 3, 4, C or E positions IAW with the basic instruction. HQ AMC/A3T approval is required for con-
   version or re-activation of API 8 positions in FSC “K” status.

2.16. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to perform
operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example, to evaluate an
operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in a flying exercise or test pro-
gram, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system and procedure) may be authorized
indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
   2.16.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA positions for
   indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of mission equipment or pro-
   cedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request to fly. Take a conservative
   approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) will establish proce-
   dures for approval of indoctrination flying in accordance with Table 2.11.. Limit incumbents to 24 fly-
   ing days per fiscal year. MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
   2.16.1. (AMC) Send indoctrination flying requests with rationale through channels to HQ AMC/
   A3TF at least five duty days prior to the proposed flight.
       2.16.1.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3T is authorized to place Individual Mobilization Augmen-
       tees (IMAs) on indoctrination flying status in support of MAJCOM Standardization Evaluation
       and Flying Training Program. Notify HQ AMC/A3TF and AFRC/A3TF of IMAs placed in an
       indoctrination flying status.
   2.16.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to support
   indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be delegated, but not
   lower than MAJCOM level.
   2.16.2. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3T is the approval authority for flights by inactive and indoctrination fly-
   ers from other commands on board AMC aircraft.
   2.16.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on emergency
   procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be physically and, where
   required, physiologically qualified.
       2.16.3.1. (Added-AMC) Indoctrination fliers do not have currency requirements, but must have
       been previously qualified in the weapons system in order to sit in a primary crew position. All
       other indoctrination flyers will sit in the jump seat or crew bunk seating as applicable. General
       Officers in indoctrination status performing duties as Airborne Emergency Action Officers
       (AEAO) will not have AEAO sorties counted against their 24-misssion indoctrination limit. Note:
       (Added) If indoctrination flying is accomplished with passengers on-board the aircraft, the indi-
       vidual will not occupy a pilot’s seat, but will use the jump seat or crew bunk seating as applicable.
       This restriction applies to all indoctrination flyers.
       2.16.3.2. (Added-AMC) An instructor will accompany personnel authorized to participate in
       flights (by the above paragraphs) when performing pilot duties.
   2.16.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or incentive
   pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T. MAJCOMs will ensure indoc-
   trination flying does not impact unit training, and will not increase command flying hour allocations.
72                                                            AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     2.16.4. (AMC) Due to limited crew member training opportunities and flying hours, it is essential for
     commanders to personally review each request to ensure it is in the best interest of the command.
     2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not authorized. Indi-
     viduals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights in single-place aircraft are
     specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mis-
     sion Flight Data Document using Other flight time, IAW paragraph 3.4.5.
     2.16.6. (Added) MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to active
     operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.

Section 2C—Flight Management Administration

2.17. Host Aviation Resource Management Office. The host command of the Air Force base desig-
nates within the operations group a HARM office function to be the base OPR for ARMS and for FRF/
JRF management of all aircrew/parachutists on base or in the locale (regardless of MAJCOM). (EXCEP-
TION: For ANG units not associated with active duty units, the ANG Wing/GSU Commander will
appoint an ANG HARM office for management of ANG flight records.) The Wing/Group HARM Chief
will be the senior or most qualified person, with a primary AFSC of 1C072, 1C092, 1C000, or civilian
equivalent. The individual appointed to this position will have a minimum of three years experience in
the Aviation Resource Management career field, and obtained/maintained Special Experience Identifier
(066). (Waiver requests to these qualification requirements must be submitted to the MAJCOM func-
tional manager with documentation of member’s qualification [copy of 1C0X2 training record document-
ing AO task certification], and expected get well date.) HARM offices will be manned according to Air
Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 13C1, OFPP Policy Letter 92-1, and the Defense Reform Initiative
Directive (DRID) 20. (EXCEPTION: Air National Guard Wing/Group HARM offices will be manned
IAW NGB/OL manpower standards for specific MDS or mission.) HARM positions are inherently gov-
ernmental and only qualified 1C0X2 personnel (and government equivalent) will operate ARMS for the
purpose of processing aviation/parachutist service entitlement actions, or monitoring and validating enti-
tlement to flight/parachutist incentive pay.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                     73


NOTES:
  1. SARM offices will maintain/manage unit FRFs/JRFs only when there is no established HARM
     office for the installation or locale. Requests for exceptions to this policy must be submitted to
     AF/A3O-AT for approval prior to operating independent SARM offices.
   2. For units with reduced manpower authorizations, limited access to the ARMS database may be
      considered on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of updating flying training information. Sub-
      mit requests for waivers to AF/A3O-AT.
   2.17.1. Prepare AOs according to Attachment 3 of this instruction and AFI 11-402.
   2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute
   Operations, AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 33-3, Information Management, and
   AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of records in accordance with the Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs
   at the HARM office nearest to where the aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possi-
   ble, medical records. (EXCEPTION: All inactive IMA FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by AFRC/
   RMG.) To ensure proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent interruptions in
   the MilPDS to ARMS interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods of less than
   90 days. For formal courses where the member will accomplish flight/jump activity, provide to the
   TDY unit a TDY/Formal Flying Processing Checklist and ARMS training products IAW AFI 11-421.
   If the member’s personnel and finance records are maintained at different locations, the HARM office
   located nearest to where the finance records are maintained will manage the member’s FRF. With the
   concurrence of both HARM offices (and MAJCOMs if different), and with MOAs in place, FRFs of
   attached flyers may be kept at the attached HARM office. Request exceptions to this policy from AF/
   A3O-AT.
NOTE: Personnel attending AETC formal flying courses at AETC will follow the guidelines to provide
additional ARMS products for TDY members established by Education & Training Course Announce-
ment (ETCA) located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil. FTUs are considered AETC facilities for FRF
management in AETC course announcements.
   2.17.3. Obtain medical information from the FME. The FME will provide the initial notification to
   the HARM office when required periodic physical examinations are completed, or when there are
   changes to an individual’s medical status that affect flying duty. Suspense is one duty day.
       2.17.3.1. DELETED
       2.17.3.2. The FME will send completed medical examination results (AF Form 1042, Medical
       Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty) to the HARM office within 10
       duty-days. If the medical examination is incomplete due to reasons beyond the member's control,
       the appropriate medical waiver authority may extend certification to cover administrative process-
       ing. The FME will inform the HARM office via AF Form 1042 if the applicable waiver authority
       extends an aircrew member’s medical certification. The official date of the AF Form 1042 will be
       the date of the flight surgeon’s signature. See also AFI 11-402.
   2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member’s finance office. The HARM
   office will ensure receipt of documentation required to validate accurate flight/jump pay entitlement,
   to include verification that the member is receiving the correct rate of incentive pay.

     2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member’s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF to obtain
     a UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member’s current assignment data. As a minimum, validate
     DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning position numbers, and active Guard/Reserve duty
     (AGR) or non-EAD status for ARC personnel.
     2.17.6. Monitor and ensure the proper FAC and ASC are assigned for all assigned and attached fliers.
     2.17.7. Ensure Special Category Codes are updated in ARMS according to Table 2.13. when an air-
     crew member’s status changes to one of the categories listed below.

or Aircraft

2.20. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
     2.20.1. Aircrew/parachutist members assigned by PCS/PCA orders to active flying/parachutist posi-
     tions in US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities or aircraft may be attached for
     flying/parachuting to units with appropriate resources. Intra-wing attachments may be approved by
     the OG/CC. Individuals must request (in writing) attachment for flying/jumping through their chain of
     command to their MAJCOM or equivalent. (EXCEPTION: Request for attachment for flying/para-
     chuting is not required if flying/parachuting support is addressed by a host-tenant agreement, but
     members will ensure required individual information is provided to the servicing HARM office.)
     Approval authority may be delegated as directed by MAJCOMs. The request must include: Individ-
     ual’s name, rank, Social Security Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD), aviation service code
     (ASC), aeronautical rating (or badge), expected duration of attachment, date of separation (DOS)/
     expiration of term of service (ETS), assigned duty position title/position number/API code, aircraft
     last qualified in, date last flown, current AO, current AF Form 1042, and requested unit of attachment
     and point of contact. (Parachutists need only provide information applicable to parachuting.) Individ-
     uals should coordinate flying/parachute qualification, currency and attachment with requested units
     prior to submitting formal request. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for attachments within the
     MAJCOM. For attachments outside an individual’s MAJCOM, submit the request to both MAJCOMs
     (or equivalent) for coordination. For attachments outside the USAF, submit the request to the gaining
     unit’s MAJCOM equivalent approval authority and the individual’s parent MAJCOM (or equivalent)
     approval authority for coordination.
     2.20.1. (AMC) EXCEPTION. Aircrew members attached to flying units within the same wing or
     group, and located on the same base do not require memorandums of attachment. EXAMPLE: An
     individual assigned to the group Stan/Eval function and attached to a local squadron for flying or
     flight surgeons assigned to local Medical Group (same wing, same base).
        2.20.1.1. (Added-AMC) Cross-command attachments must be coordinated by the requesting
        member’s MAJCOM prior to arriving at HQ AMC/A3TF. Additionally, MAJCOM/A3 must coor-
        dinate on AMC flyers seeking attachment to another MAJCOM’s flying unit prior to the request
        being sent to that MAJCOM. EXCEPTION: Flight surgeons of other commands, in valid API 5
        positions, may be attached to AMC units without memorandums of attachment provided such sup-
        port is addressed in a memorandum of agreement between the flight surgeon’s base/command and
        the AMC unit owning the aircraft. All such memorandums of attachment will be forwarded to HQ
        AMC/A3TF and kept on file. Memorandums of attachment are reaccomplished every 48 months
        or upon reassignment (PCS/PCA) (this includes when the unit of attachment deactivates), which-
        ever is earliest. See Attachment 9.

        2.20.1. of the basic instruction. To ensure correct data is submitted acquire the most current Indi-
        vidual Data Summary (IDS) and Flying History Report (FHR) from the HARM office which
        maintains your FRF. Also, contact your Orderly Room for your PAS code, duty AFSC and
        Assigned Position Number. Validate position number to ensure double billeting does not occur.
        2.20.2.4. (Added-AMC) Forward the request to the desired unit of attachment (to expedite mat-
        ters send an E-mail for request and coordination).
        2.20.2.5. (Added-AMC) The CC or DO from the requested squadron of attachment and the OG/
        CC (or equivalent) will endorse the request, approve or disapprove the attachment. The approved
        request will then be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF. If the requestor belongs to another MAJCOM
        besides AMC ensure approval is received from member’s MAJCOM/A3T. If the requester is
        assigned to AMC but seeking attachment to another MAJCOM ensure approval is received from
        AMC/A3 (Rated) or AMC/A3TF (CEA or non-Rated).
        2.20.2.6. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3TF will verify the individual is in an active flying position
        and finalize the attachment with an endorsement. HQ AMC/A3TF will maintain all attachment
        memos and send copies to the OG/CC, each HARM office concerned, and the individual. Attach-
        ments will expire 48 months from the date of MAJCOM/A3 endorsement. If the attachment
        requires endorsement from another MAJCOM the expiration date will be 48 months from the date
        of the latest endorsement. Those attachments that require attachment beyond the 48 month point
        must reapply (NO EXCEPTIONS). Follow the same coordination chain as listed above. Memo-
        randums of attachment are reaccomplished every 48 months or upon reassignment (PCS/PCA),
        (this includes when the unit of attachment deactivates) whichever is earliest. See Attachment 7
        (Added).
        2.20.2.7. (Added-AMC) If an aircrew member is attached for flying, the squadron they are
        attached to will establish a training profile in ARMS. When an aircrew member is no longer
        assigned/attached, the SARM will order ARMS training products to file in their PIF and, if the
        member is inactive, send one copy to the HARM to file in the FRF. These actions need to occur
        prior to the deletion of the member’s training profile,

Section 3A—Records Maintenance

3.1. Flight and Jump Records and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) Functional
Responsibility. The individual flight or jump record folder is the official source for determining incentive
pay entitlement, current flying or jump status, and total experience. HARM offices will enter aviation
resource data into the ARMS database and maintain FRFs/JRFs IAW paragraph 2.17.2. of this instruction.
Dispose of Air Force records in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS),
located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil, and this instruction.
   3.1.1. Use these records as the basis for USAF flying resource inventory reporting (RCS:
   HAF-A3O[M&AR]0701). This report provides essential individual flying information to HQ USAF
   and MAJCOMs. HARM offices ensure the report is transmitted not later than the 10th of each month
   (or as soon as possible for special reports). Continue to report during emergency conditions, prece-
   dence delayed (Emergency Status Code C-3). Continue reporting during MINIMIZE.
   3.1.2. The HARM office is the sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/A3OT) at each flying
   base for entitlement to and the initiation and termination of Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP),
   Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) for flying
   and parachute duties. The HARM office interprets public law as it pertains to flying/jumping incen-
   tive pays; audits, reconciles, and processes associated waiver requests; is the single point of contact
   for ARMS; and is responsible for the following procedures:
       3.1.2.1. The HARM office, maintains FRFs/JRFs for all flying (active and inactive) and jump
       personnel with the assigned HARM code established for that base. The ARMS program manager
       will allocate one ARMS database code per base. (EXCEPTION: The ARMS program manager
       may allocate more than one ARMS database code for installations granted an exception IAW
       paragraph 2.17. of this instruction.) The HARM office must be located in a securable area to
       ensure integrity of Privacy Act material when office personnel are not present.
           3.1.2.1.1. Base HARM offices keep the FRFs/JRFs for all assigned tenant and attached per-
           sonnel ordered to take part in regular and frequent flights as aircrew, operational support mem-
           bers, and parachutists. This includes all active duty and ARC active and inactive aircrew
           members, active operational support members, and parachutists.
           3.1.2.1.2. Base HARM offices will combine the FRF and JRF into one folder for dual quali-
           fied aircrew and parachutist members. File documents IAW AFI 11-421.
           3.1.2.1.3. Base HARM offices will maintain FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or parachut-
           ists (entitlement status 0) for eight years after such designation. After eight consecutive years,
           return the FRF/JRF to the member. (EXCEPTION: for UFT students disqualified from train-
           ing and operational support fliers removed from flying for more than one year, release the FRF

        3.1.3.2. An aircrew/parachutist member satisfies flight/jump entitlement requirements for pay
        following a period of failure to meet minimum requirements (or a period of suspension disqualifi-
        cation has been removed), or a member otherwise regains entitlement to incentive pay.
        3.1.3.3. An individual in conditional entitlement status (ESC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, E, F, G, or H) departs
        PCS to a non-flying or non-jump position.
        3.1.3.4. A parachutist enters into a 12-month Rule 3 waiver period IAW DODFMR and AFI
        11-421, Aviation Resource Management. The HARM office will terminate pay until jump require-
        ments are met.
     3.1.4. Release the FRF to individual custody only after the HARM office receives:
     3.1.4. (AMC) Release the FRF/JRF to individual custody only after the HARM office receives:
        3.1.4.1. Official PCS orders or TDY orders indicating a TDY with another USAF activity for a
        period of 90 days or more (ref. paragraph 1.5.4.). (Units have the option to transfer records to the
        gaining HARM office for TDYs.)
            3.1.4.1.1. (Added-AMC) While attending formal school, students will document all continu-
            ation training events they complete on an AETC defined mission accomplishment form. After
            returning to their duty station, students will turn in training documentation to their unit to
            update the individuals ARMS record.
            3.1.4.1.2. (Added-AMC) Do not release the FRF/JRF for TDY to contingency or other simi-
            lar type of operations. Do not release the FRF/JRF to individuals in a suspended (ASC 04) avi-
            ation service status.
        3.1.4.2. Official retirement or separation orders.
        3.1.4.3. Notice that the aircrew member has been disqualified for more than eight consecutive
        years. (See paragraph 3.1.2.1.3. for one-year release.)
        3.1.4.4. (Added-AMC) AMC HARM offices and those maintaining AMC records will establish
        a sign-out log. As a minimum, the log will provide name, rank, organization, estimated duration,
        signature block, and a suspense block. WG/CCs, OG/CCs, squadron commanders and members of
        inspection teams may temporarily sign out FRFs to perform official duties. The HARM must have
        a letter on file signed by the Squadron Commander designating those individuals who are autho-
        rized to pickup FRFs.
     3.1.5. Release of Data from Flight/Jump Records.
        3.1.5.1. Information maintained in the FRF/JRF is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of
        1974. HARM offices have a legal obligation to safeguard these records from unlawful disclosure.
        Standard ARMS reports or ad hoc queries which contain personal data will have the symbol
        "(PA)" in the product title and contain the statement "Personal Data - Privacy Act of 1974."
        3.1.5.2. The disclosure of information, for any purpose, to other than those AF activities with an
        official need, is not authorized without the expressed written consent of the member concerned.
        3.1.5.3. Except where allowed by law, do not disclose data to agencies outside the Department of
        Defense. Reference AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. Maintain a record of each disclosure to
        include name and address of the person or agency receiving the data, date, nature and purpose of
        each disclosure.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                         83


          3.1.5.3.1. Retain a copy of the disclosure on file as part of the FRF/JRF. Prior to releasing the
          FRF/JRF, the HARM office will remove all records disclosures. Retain the disclosure
          accounting on file for five years or for the life of the record, whichever is longer.
       3.1.5.4. The Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 requires that before a civilian airline hires a
       pilot, the air carrier must request and receive certain records from "any carrier or other persons
       that have employed the individual at any time during the preceding five years." Before any infor-
       mation is released to an agency based on this Act, HARM offices must receive a written release of
       information statement signed by the applicant via the agency or applicant. This statement confirms
       the applicant agrees to the release of records to the air carrier. The HARM office will not release
       any information without receipt of this signed statement. HARM offices must release information
       within 30 days of receipt of the request. Additionally, the releaser must provide notice to the appli-
       cant that a release request has been received and inform the applicant of his or her right to receive
       a copy of the records. The HARM office will provide the Individual Flight Record (IFR), Flying
       History Report (FHR), and documents contained in the member’s Flying Evaluation Folder (FEF)
       for the preceding five years from the date of employment application of the member. If the mem-
       ber’s FEF is maintained in another location, the HARM office must obtain and provide copies to
       the requesting agency.
   3.1.6. The FRFs/JRFs of personnel assigned or attached to other than USAF activities must be kept at
   a designated HARM office. The following guidance applies:
       3.1.6.1. The parent command will designate a HARM office to maintain FRFs/JRFs for individ-
       ual aircrew members or parachutists on duty with other US military services.
       3.1.6.2. The MAJCOM with geographical cognizance over the area or country to which the indi-
       vidual is assigned or attached for duty with an allied service or on duty with non-US military agen-
       cies will designate a HARM office to maintain the FRF/JRF.
       3.1.6.3. If the individual’s FRF/JRF is required at the crewmember’s or parachutist’s duty station,
       provide a duplicate copy. The master record will be kept at the HARM office designated by the
       MAJCOM.
       3.1.6.4. The designated HARM office will notify the member’s parent MAJCOM if the member
       will exceed 180 days in FSC “S” or FSC “4” status. Notify the MAJCOM prior to the member
       exceeding the 180-day limit. See also paragraph 1.4.1.8.
NOTE: MAJCOM notification is not required for members assigned FSC S due to extended DNIF.

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (ARMS)

3.2. Background Information. This section explains the conditions under which personnel are autho-
rized to log flight activity into ARMS. ARMS will be used for tracking and management of all aircrew
and operational support flight activity.
   3.2.1. The Air Force flying program is designed to ensure that each individual actively engaged in
   performing airborne duties maintains basic professional skills. This requires accurately logged flight
   and simulator activity to record and monitor flying experience.
   3.2.1. (AMC) The aircrew member will ensure copies of his or her MAR and AFTO IMT 781
   extracts or AF Form 3520s are submitted to the HARM office at the unit of assignment for ARMS
84                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


     processing. Jumpers will ensure copies of his or her MAR and AF IMT Form 4323 or AF IMT 922
     extracts are submitted to the HARM office at the unit of assignment for ARMS processing. During
     deployments/contingency operations where there is no access to ARMS, forward the original AFTO
     IMT 781(front and back side) to the aircraft’s home station at least weekly.
     3.2.2. Flight data must be recorded and reported accurately to provide commanders with meaningful
     flight experience information to ensure resources are effectively used and only qualified personnel
     receive incentive pay. Units will follow AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, to
     develop local training accomplishment forms for entering training data into ARMS.
     3.2.3. Responsibility of Pilot in Command. Enter and credit flight time on an individual's flight
     record only when flown according to this instruction and properly logged on AFTO Form 781 or AF
     Form 3250. The pilot designated, as "in command" of the aircraft is responsible for making sure the
     appropriate form is dated and properly completed, to include specific remarks as required. These
     forms provide an accurate record of pertinent flight data for personnel authorized to take part in the
     flight and to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.

3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
     3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
        3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be medically
        cleared for flying duty, documented on an AF Form 1042.
        3.3.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
        3.3.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain aircrew quali-
        fication, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
        3.3.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8/8a qualification)
        and aircrew position identifier (Table A2.3.) designated on the flight authorization for the aircraft.
        (EXCEPTION: aircrew members authorized to perform inflight duties in non-USAF aircraft,
        IAW paragraph 1.11., will comply with guidance applicable to the authority controlling the air-
        craft in regards to flight authorization requirements.)
        3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew duties in the
        aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required for the mission.
            3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew complement may
            log flying time only when specifically authorized to perform duties required for the mission
            (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc), or when specifically authorized to perform mis-
            sion-related observation or evaluation duties. Members will comply with all other applicable
            requirements to include medical clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
            3.3.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying
            time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis (reference paragraph
            2.12.4.), will use crew position "OX" (Colonel and above) or "XX" (Lt Col and below) IAW
            Table A2.3., and will log other time on the AFTO Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
            3.3.1.5.3. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor operator positions will log flying
            time in assigned UAS aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis (reference para-
            graph 2.12.7.), will use aircrew position (Second Character) "X" IAW Table A2.3., and will
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                       85


           log AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate with qualification and duties per-
           formed for entry into ARMS.
   3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW paragraph 1.9.4.7.1. and logging flight
   time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure crewmembers and parachut-
   ists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY, or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Tem-
   porary Assignment Duty (TAD), regardless of duration, or while flying on an aircraft during
   point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not
   log flying time when the purpose for flying is to make a proficiency-sustaining jump or perform jump-
   master duties. EXCEPTION: Pararescue personnel in "X" coded billets may log flying time if aircrew
   duties are performed during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in the
   remarks section of the AFTO Form 781.
   3.3.3. For individuals authorized to perform inflight duties in non-US Air Force aircraft, reference
   paragraph 1.11., paragraph 3.3.1.4., above, does not apply. IAW paragraph 3.3.1.5., individuals must
   be required for the mission.

3.4. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also apply to syn-
thetic training devices categorized as operational flying trainers or weapon system trainers. Log flight
time only on the AFTO Form 781 and AF Form 3520, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract, and
use only the approved Flight Authorization Duty Codes listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.3..
   3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty station identi-
   fied in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their aircrew specialty. Only
   qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining qualification in the aircraft will log pri-
   mary time when performing in-flight duties. Non-rated aircrew members and operational support per-
   sonnel who do not have an established crew duty station will log primary time only when actually
   performing required in-flight duty. For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacua-
   tion patients.
       3.4.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
           3.4.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of paragraph
           3.7.1. will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
           3.4.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing instru-
           ment training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
           3.4.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy Test
           Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using FP, FN, or
           FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative or approved
           short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot School graduates to
           perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew members at the controls of the
           aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
           3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to authorized flying
           billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the nor-
           mal aircrew complement to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/person-
           nel missions may log primary flight time when performing patient support duties on mass
           personnel recovery missions. Primary time is authorized only during the time required
           in-flight duties are performed. During periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties
86                                                          AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


           associated with the rescued members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, "Other" flight
           time will be logged. Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in
           additional to basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
           781.
           3.4.1.1.5. (Added) Operational support medical personnel may log primary time when tasked
           to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR),
           Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions. If tasked to
           fly on sister service CSAR, CASEVAC, or MEDEVAC missions, ensure requests are coordi-
           nated though the member's MAJCOM IAW paragraph 1.11.1. of this instruction.
           3.4.1.1.6. (added) Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECM) on Aeromedical Readi-
           ness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous (tandem) training on the same
           aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to meet flight currency requirements.
           AECMs in primary crew positions will log primary time when performing in-flight duties.
           Example: Two basic AE crews conducting separate in-flight training using separate in-flight
           kits, medical equipment, and mission documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the
           flight crew prior to take off for CRM purposes.
       3.4.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding hands-on-time
       flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or evaluator). It is not pred-
       icated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place aircraft), or on the duty position indi-
       cated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving instruction while controlling the aircraft will log
       primary time
       3.4.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their rated spe-
       cialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space station duties
       may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space station duty, use Aircrew
       Position Identifier (Second Character) "A" from Attachment 2,Table A2.3..
       3.4.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing duties at a
       duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is established for the
       same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time while actually performing
       the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple Air Surveillance Operator positions
       on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
       Factors, authorized crew duty station(s) flight test engineers may occupy during test functions.
       During periods when the flight test engineer is not actively performing his or her evaluation/test
       duties, Other time will be logged.) Except under conditions in this paragraph, the total primary
       time for any specific aircrew specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
NOTE: Due to the broad nature of flight surgeon duties, each position which another aircrew member
occupies (as defined in AFPD 11-4, e.g., pilot, navigator, ABM, observer, or CEA personnel), may be
considered as a flight surgeon station/position (i.e., a KC-135 with a pilot, copilot, and boom operator
would be authorized three flight surgeon stations). If there are more flight surgeons onboard than aircrew
stations, the total primary time must be split between those flight surgeons onboard by logging primary
and other time. When the number of flight surgeons on board is less or equal to the number of occupied
aircrew stations, all flight surgeons are authorized to log primary time for the entire mission.
       3.4.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific aircraft, but tasked
       to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in an aircraft in which they are not
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                          87


       current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew certification code (first character of crew position)
       "F" and primary time for that mission. See also paragraph 3.3.1.5.1.
NOTE: Utilization of non-current and/or unqualified personnel is an exception to established policy.
Every effort must be made to obtain current and qualified personnel to perform aircrew duties prior to uti-
lizing non-current and/or unqualified personnel.
       3.4.1.5. (AMC) AECMs must have universal qualification on the following aircraft; C-17, C-130,
       KC-135 and C-21 (if applicable to the unit mission) to log primary flight time while performing
       duties.
   3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing inflight
   duties related to the crewmember’s specialty, but who is not controlling the function of that specialty.
   Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty will not exceed the total
   flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew complement, annotate in the
   remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed by additional aircrew.
       3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log second-
       ary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI 65-503; and tasked
       to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft (e.g., Flight Attendants
       tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV missions) will log secondary time as long
       as they maintain currency in their primary aircraft. The member’s aircrew certification code will
       reflect the current qualification. If not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log “X” or “O” as
       the aircrew qualification code first character IAW Table A2.3..
       3.4.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of flight con-
       trols and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
       3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing inflight duties
       of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that specialty (for example, sec-
       ond navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs on AOs required to perform
       "in-flight duties" assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a rescue mission) when dictated by mission
       requirements.
           3.4.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight duties per-
           formed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in additional to basic crew
           complement) to perform the mission.
           3.4.2.3.2. (Added-AMC) Second boom operators required for passenger and cargo missions
           will log secondary time. Annotate specific mission requirements on AFTO IMT 781 in the
           remarks section to support secondary time logged.
           3.4.2.3.3. (Added-AMC) Non-Rated/non-CEA aircrew instructor or evaluator candidates
           will log secondary time while performing instructor or evaluator candidate duties and annotate
           in the remarks on the back of the AFTO IMT 781.
       3.4.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary time when
       performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties during aeromedical
       readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight time when performing simu-
       lated patient duties
88                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


        3.4.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
        will not exceed the total flight time.
        3.4.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs
        and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to per-
        form in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions, may log secondary
        time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Coordinator duties on mass personnel
        recovery training missions. Secondary time is authorized only during such time those in-flight
        duties are performed. During periods when the PJ is not performing "in-flight" duties associated
        with the rescued members or mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight
        time will be logged.
     3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor while
     actively performing authorized instructional duties. Includes "hands on" time during demonstration
     activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to occupying a primary
     duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing instructor duties. Except as
     provided for in this section, members must be qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor
     time. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503 and paragraph 3.4.3.1., the total instructor flight time for
     each aircrew specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
        3.4.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training instruc-
        tion (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for the three-person crew or third
        pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a specific event may be logged
        as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like specialty are on the aircraft to provide simul-
        taneous instruction for crewmembers of different specialties, both instructors may log instructor
        time (e.g., two instructor navigators are on the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator
        and the other is instructing a boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed
        total flight time logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the ratio-
        nale for logging excess instructor time.
        3.4.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and each log
        instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight time logged.
        (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more experienced FTU instructor
        flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur between the new FTU instructor and stu-
        dent or between the experienced FTU instructor and new instructor, but not both simultaneously.
        Therefore, the total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight time.)
        3.4.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are current and
        qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log instructor time while fly-
        ing in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew member in the first aircraft. This
        applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not
        maintain instructor qualification in the chase aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while
        actively providing instruction. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the
        rationale for logging instructor time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a refer-
        ence).
        3.4.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their activity, when
        not performing instructor duties.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                             89


       3.4.3.4. (AMC) Instructors performing primary or secondary duties while instructing will log
       instructor time. When an instructor pilot is performing primary duties while instructing (demon-
       strating a maneuver), the pilot in the other seat will log secondary time.
           3.4.3.4.1. (Added-AMC) Log instructor and flight examiner time only when performing
           appropriate duties and designated as "I" or "E" on flight authorizations. When instructor or
           examiner duties are terminated, log primary, secondary or other time, as appropriate. When an
           instructor is required to instruct an unlike specialty (i.e. a navigator instructing a pilot) instruc-
           tor time will be logged. Annotate in remarks section of AFTO IMT 781.
           3.4.3.4.2. (Added-AMC) On an initial or requalification evaluation, examinees will log time
           in the crew position currently qualified; e.g. an instructor upgrade candidate will not log
           instructor time.
       3.4.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified as an
       instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be instructors in the simu-
       lator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time. MAJCOMs will determine
       which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g., operational flight trainers, weapon system
       trainers, etc.
   3.4.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight evaluator while
   actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes "hands on" time if coincident with
   performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to occupy a primary duty station
   established for that specialty, but must be actually performing evaluator duties. Evaluators will also
   log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their activity, when not performing
   evaluator duties.
NOTE: Members must be current and certified in the aircraft to log evaluator time. When flight evalua-
tors conduct flight evaluations onboard aircraft in which they are not qualified, then members must log
"O" or "X" as the aircrew qualification code first character IAW Table A2.3..
   3.4.4. (AMC) Flight examiners, conducting evaluations on aircraft in which they are not qualified,
   may log flight time. They will use qualification code "X" (e.g. XP, XN), log "other" time, and enter an
   explanation on the reverse side of the AFTO IMT 781.
   3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight authorization, but
   who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the requirements of primary, sec-
   ondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or extra crewmembers taking part in the
   flight, required for the mission to augment the crew or perform mission-related observation or evalu-
   ator duties (not qualified in the aircraft). Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log
   other time during periods of crew rest or sleep.
   3.4.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
       3.4.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against an enemy
       of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile fire. Aerial activity
       in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure to hostile fire. Combat
       includes both elements: activity against an enemy or opposing force (or activity supporting forces
       engaging an enemy or opposing force) and risk of exposure to hostile fire.
           3.4.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air Force
           Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace. Hostile air-
90                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


            space is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically designated as hostile airspace
            by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to hostile fire. The combat zone may contain
            areas that are not designated as hostile airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the
            aerial activity must be accomplished in a designated combat zone within the designated hostile
            airspace. Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
            airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire.
            (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the COMAFFOR under
            extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log combat time outside of the hos-
            tile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat zone. If an exception is granted, include
            the exception in the guidance designating the combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAF-
            FOR will publish guidelines specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat sup-
            port flight time and will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for
            logging combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but the use
            of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish hostile airspace
            criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time. NOTE: COMAFFOR
            will issue new guidance and procedures every two years to ensure all Air Force units are aware
            of the current policy.
        3.4.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against an
        enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the designated hostile airspace,
        where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes aerial activity directly supporting forces
        engaged in combat or directly supporting those who are actively supporting combat when the
        aerial activity occurs outside the designated hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as
        described above under combat time.
        3.4.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an individ-
        ual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an AO that requires
        the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to perform in-flight aircrew
        duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW paragraph 3.3. of this instruction. Do not combine
        mission symbols; use one symbol for the entire flight.
     3.4.7. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Time. UAS crews may be authorized to simultaneously
     control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time logged by each individual will
     reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and is not dependent upon the number of air-
     craft actually controlled. Flight time logged will not exceed the time the individual was performing
     inflight duties.

3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in paragraph 3.4. are the basis for accumulating flying
experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a mission in the appropriate cate-
gory. Provisions have been made to record, for historical purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight con-
dition: night, instrument, and simulated instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition
simultaneously (for example, night and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories
on the form. The type of time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or
procedure accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
3.5. (AMC) The proper instrument or simulated instrument time must be recorded on the AFTO IMT 781
when aircrew members log penetrations or precision approaches on their training mission accomplish-
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                          91


ment reports. Night time will be logged by all crew members who have night training requirements
(including Night Vision goggles even when no night events are logged on the MAR).
   3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged
   between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in
   the American Air Almanac. (EXCEPTION: An evaluator will log night time as a flight condition in
   conjunction with "other" flight time when performing evaluation duties onboard aircraft in which he
   or she does not maintain qualification.) Crewmembers having night training requirements (includes
   wear of NVG) specified by Air Force or MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel
   assigned at latitudes above 60 degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees south
   (November through February), night requirements are waived when removal from active flying or
   PCS occurs during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator when operating in simu-
   lated night conditions.
   3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged
   when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained primarily by reference to the
   flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when performing duties in this flight condition.
NOTE: To log primary instrument time in the aircraft, an instructor or evaluator pilot must occupy a duty
station with a set of flight controls, but does not have to actively (hands-on) control the aircraft. IAW Fed-
eral Aviation Administration guidance, a flight simulator or approved flight training device may be used
by a pilot to log instrument time, provided an authorized instructor is present during the simulated flight.
   3.5.3. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, "hands-on" instructor, or
   "hands-on" evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft attitude primarily by refer-
   ence to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when performing duties in this flight con-
   dition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
   3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member wearing
   night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twi-
   light, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing aircrew duties in a crew
   position with NVG training requirements will log this time while wearing NVGs. NVG time may also
   be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members instructing or evaluating individuals who are per-
   forming crew duties where NVGs are required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time
   logged. NVG time may be logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training
   (simulator model and simulator software).

3.6. Non-rated Flight Time. Non-rated aircrew members will log flying time using the proper flight
authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and when actively performing specific
inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders (paragraph 3.9.). Aeromedical evacuation
crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight authorization and actively engaged in operational air
evacuation or air rescue missions; aeromedical research and development inflight; or air evacuation train-
ing missions that require AECMs in a crew position, being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in
paragraph 3.4.2.4. above.

Section 3C—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.7. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to paragraph 3.3. toward
incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in "O" or "X" status does not entitle the member to OFDA
92                                                           AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


credit, ACIP or HDIP. NOTE: See Attachment 2, Table A2.3.. EXCEPTION: Air Technicians (AT) and
Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in military status to log time for incentive pay. This Air Force
Instruction and MAJCOMs define the inflight duties that qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
     3.7.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One Aircraft and
     Not Other Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and equivalent organizations,
     and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders (including unit commanders) and key
     supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have
     other types assigned to their units, to fly in a primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they
     are not qualified. Individuals will be under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew
     position. The crewmember will log an "O" or "X" as the aircrew qualification code first character and
     his or her assigned second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3. (As noted above, Flight
     time flown in "O" or "X" status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
     paragraph 3.4.1.1.1.

3.8. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive Flying Status.
Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US Government aircraft except as pro-
vided in FAC waivers listed in Table 2.2., paragraphs 2.9.2.2., 2.10.1.1., and 2.16. In all such cases, inac-
tive crewmembers must maintain physical and physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation
service.

3.9. Non-rated Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. Inflight duties authorized by
Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or position symbol for logging
flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished when actively performing inflight duties
as follows:
     3.9.1. Non-rated Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to an authorized
     non-rated aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and
     65-503, and:
        3.9.1.1. The individual’s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties on a frequent
        and regular basis.
        3.9.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and associated
        equipment required for mission accomplishment.
     3.9.2. Operational Support (Non-crewmember) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a specified
     time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in AFI 65-503 and to
     supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for limited periods to perform
     essential and specific in-flight duties that cannot be accomplished by authorized aircrew personnel.
     Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.

3.10. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight duties
authorized by paragraph 1.11. may log flying time in non-Air Force aircraft for credit towards OFDA
requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only "Other" flight time will be credited in an individual's flight
records.
3.10. (AMC) Aircrew members who have MAJCOM/A3T approval to perform duties on non-USAF Air-
craft will, as a minimum, return a completed AFTO IMT 3520, a copy of their Flight Authorization or the
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        93


other service’s version of the flight authorization, and a completed MAR to the unit for post mission
review prior to input into ARMS database.

3.11. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other US
military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or other
official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the Other US
Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not included in this category if per-
formed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air Force order); such time is recorded as Air
Force rated time.
NOTE: Interservice transfers who previously participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program
may have their time separated by Air Force MDS. Example: Capt Bailey, an interservice transfer, flew
350 hours in the F-16 during his Naval career under an approved Air Force exchange program. Capt
Bailey’s flight time may be logged under the MDS F-16 in ARMS. This time will be subtracted from the
total Other US Military flying time.

3.12. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the student time hour block.

3.13. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other govern-
ments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or other official record
certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the Foreign Military hour block.

3.14. Logging Flight Time in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to para-
graph 3.3. in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only when directed
by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty assignment of the person con-
cerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250 and, except for
CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.

3.15. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450 or more
rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by authorized persons.
(These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation activities; suitable agents of com-
mercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from which the reported flying was performed,
if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered
into ARMS in the civilian hour block.

3.16. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit Quarterly
GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ USAF/A3OT by the
15th of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is designated emergency status code C-3.
Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher prece-
dence reports. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue report-
ing during MINIMIZE. The report will include the following:

Terms
A-Staff—DELETED
additional crewmember (ACM)—Aircrew members not required for a particular mission being flown,
but who are required for follow-on missions. MAJCOMs further define ACMs in supplements to this
instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown grants ACM
status. ACMs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the
provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
aircrew—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, and flight surgeons),
career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed
Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft
and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission.
Includes members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying
position. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to
AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew
complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and
their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be
essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or
other duties essential to the aircraft’s mission.

NOTES:
  1. US Air Force Academy (USAFA)/Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)
     cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively
     participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on aeronautical orders authorizing flying
     status while participating in approved USAFA flying programs and will not be added in the oper-
     ational ARMS database. HARM office personnel will not assign an Aviation Service Code
     (ASC) and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither flying incentive pay
     nor flying duty credit are authorized.
      2. The term "navigator" includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with the designation
         Combat Systems Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but previously quali-
         fied individuals will continue to be identified as navigators.
Air Force aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper signature
or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on Department of the
Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that awards a pilot rating).
authorized aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning Factors,
Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces), Attachment A37-1 (Authorized
Aircrew Composition Reserve Forces), and Attachment A38-1, (Authorized Aircrew Composition Guard
Forces).
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Incentive pay for rated officers in an aviation career as
authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,
and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flight duties. For
rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in
which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating and is placed on aeronautical
orders (for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H class or Weapons Systems Training) or
date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date all requirements for
the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course 50BY9351 or equivalent was
completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD for medical students who have completed Course 50BY9351 will
be the date post graduate medical training is completed, an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC
48XX is awarded, and the flight surgeon rating is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for
award of the ASD.) For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal ABM
flying training (class start date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the member first reports
to the aviation activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to career
enlisted aviator status and is placed on aeronautical orders. Rated ASDs and CEA ASDs are established
separately. See also AFI 11-402.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 8A000.
Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for career enlisted aviators in an aviation
career as authorized in the FY 00 NDAA.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        101


Civil Air Patrol - United States Air Force (CAP-USAF)—CAP-USAF is the Air Force agency that
coordinates or approves use of the Civil Air Patrol to carry out non-combat missions of the Air Force
(IAW AFI 10-2701).
commander—When used in this instruction, "commander" refers to a wing commander (or comparable
level), or any level higher within the chain of command, of a flying unit to which an individual is assigned
or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the wing, authority may be
delegated to a group or squadron level.
conditional entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators in an
aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP, conditional to meeting minimum monthly
flying time standards IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapters 22 and 24, and AFI 11-421.
continuation training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain proficiency in the
assigned qualification level. This training must be recorded in the ARMS database.
continuous entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators in an
aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
flight authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational support, and
authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and authorized to perform duties on
specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. ACMs and MEGPs may be placed on the flight authorization,
only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the mission(s) on which they
performed duties.
form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools). IAW AFI
33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
frequent and regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, term which
establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional Aviation Career
Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay
(HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, sets the minimum at four hours for active duty
(DoDFMR, Part Two) and two hours for Air Reserve Components (ARC) per calendar month, or a
prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not
justification to assign an individual to aircrew or operational support flier status. There must be a need to
perform inflight duties.
government aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to perform
flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.

pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these incentive pays; and the single point of contact for
ARMS. This position is inherently governmental.
instrument flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be
maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO is to validate individual
qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and regular
participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual entitlement to ACIP,
CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for which an
aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of one or more sorties.
Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie. See Table 2.2..
mission essential ground personnel (MEGP)—Personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to
perform unique ground support duties at an enroute location or the point of destination that are directly
related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown, e.g., a maintenance specialist
required to perform routine ground maintenance or a security team required to guard the aircraft at
enroute or destination stops. MAJCOMs may further define MEGP in MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown grants MEGP
status. MEGPs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the
provisions of DoD 4515.13-R. EXCEPTION: MEGPs who are mission essential to aircraft launch/
recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying passengers. MEGPs who fly under the
provisions of this exception must be physically and physiologically (when required) qualified and must
complete applicable egress training prior to flight.
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer,
whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal commissioned
service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For flight surgeons, the OSD
includes constructive service granted medical officers in the computation of creditable service for basic
pay.
operational flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel (primarily
for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic flying skills
usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
operational support flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require flying. The Air
Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a specific, essential inflight
duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties may include, but are not limited to
inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific aircraft systems or installed equipment. To
receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders
and complete prescribed flying hour requirements. Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance
of aeronautical orders.
orientation flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local flying area and
terminating at the point of origin. See also paragraph 1.9.4.7.1. and Table 1.1..
pilot in command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in command of an
aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the assigned mission.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                          103


point-to-point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a different
location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on takeoff or
takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns
to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are stopped, or the aircraft is on
the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change is made in the crew which enplanes or
deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency training, on missions during which some
crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered
to be a continuation of the original aircrew sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew
requirements and procedures for aircrew continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
supervisory aircrew or staff member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8, B, and D)
who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but individuals are not
required to fly.
training level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status (basic aircraft
qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they are required to
maintain.
training period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
unit commander—When used in this instruction, "unit commander" refers to the squadron commander
(or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA
                              DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service configuration,
and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and reporting operational flight or training
device information for each individual authorized to take part in a mission. This form is the primary
record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay
eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original
AFTO Form 781 must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is
assigned. This form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publish-
ing.af.mil.

A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device time in
an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record.
A2.2. (AMC) Scope These instructions also pertain to the AF IMT 3520.

A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. Maintenance personnel are
responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing AFTO Form 781 and other forms in
that series is a joint responsibility of maintenance personnel and the pilot in command.
      A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form 781 are
      onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of copies to fulfill mis-
      sion requirements.
      A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed to show
      all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel authorized to take part in the flight. The
      pilot in command:
      A2.3.2. (AMC) Ensure the original AFTO IMT 781 is complete, including all information under Sec-
      tion II, Aircrew Data. The unit of aircraft assignment will maintain the original form. Ensure all
      AFTO IMT 781 extracts are completed IAW paragraph A2.4. of the basic instruction.
         A2.3.2.1. Before flight, reviews the aircraft status as indicated on AFTO Forms in the 781-series
         and then signs the exceptional release, if not previously signed by maintenance.
         A2.3.2.2. Documents all discrepancies observed before, during, and after flight on AFTO Form
         781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
         A2.3.2.3. After the flight is completed, fills in the required entries in item 10, Flight Condition
         Data (AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document) and ini-
         tials item 38 of AFTO Form 781.
      A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must be removed from the AFTO Form 781 binder after the
      information is entered at maintenance debriefing and delivered to either the SARM or maintenance
      plans and scheduling office (MAJCOM option) and after ARMS update is provided to the HARM
      office.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                      107


  A2.3.3. (AMC) To ensure hours flown are properly reported, AMC units will comply with the fol-
  lowing:
     A2.3.3.1. (Added-AMC) Conduct a daily mission review. Representatives from maintenance
     and operations will review all flying hours entered into CAMS/GO81 using the daily Aircraft Uti-
     lization Report. The purpose of this review is to correct errors on mission paperwork (to include
     inaccurate time and/or mission symbols) and ensure AFTO IMT 781 data input into CAMS/GO81
     reflects what is on the original form. All AMC units will perform daily mission review and audit
     training (continuation and ground), flight and jump documentation forms for accuracy before
     updating the ARMS database (example: side by side comparison of Flight Authorizations, MARs,
     AF IMT 4323 (for jumpers), and AFTO IMT 781, as well as any other applicable mission paper-
     work by ARMS (Qualified 1C0X2), operations, maintenance debriefer (if possible), scheduler (if
     possible), AE person (if applicable), squadron training, Flight/CC and a CEA representative. The
     positions of Flight/CC and CEA representative should be on a rotational basis between the pri-
     mary and alternate.
     A2.3.3.2. (Added-AMC) After the AFTO IMT 781 has been input into CAMS/GO81 and Ops
     and Maintenance debrief the AFTO IMT 781 and the CAMS/GO81, audits will be sent to the
     Wing AVUM to be filed and maintained.
     A2.3.3.3. (Added-AMC) The G081/CAMS computer database will be audited by maintenance
     and operations personnel using the daily and monthly Aircraft Utilization Reports (AUR). All air-
     craft time, landing and sortie discrepancies will be resolved in a timely manner.
  A2.3.4. Each unit operations officer:
     A2.3.4.1. Gives to the maintenance organization that services the aircraft assigned to that unit the
     necessary organization and location information to be entered in items 4 and 5 of AFTO Form
     781. This ensures completed forms are sent to the proper SARM or HARM office for entry into
     ARMS.
     A2.3.4.2. Ensures a responsible individual audits the unit's AFTO Forms 781 for accuracy and
     legibility and initials in item 39 of the form before sending it to the HARM office. Where local
     procedures establish the HARM office as the auditing agency, the responsible individual from that
     office initials the form in item 39.
     A2.3.4.3. The original copy of the AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM office that
     services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the end of the month in
     which the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a flight flown in March must be
     turned in to the servicing HARM office NLT 5 April.
     EXCEPTION: ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP entitlement information may for-
     ward the AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM office not later than the first day following two
     months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the above example, the forms would
     not be required to be turned into the HARM office until 1 June.
         A2.3.4.3.1. SARM offices will not maintain duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781 (including
         extracts). If changes are required after the flight information has been entered in ARMS and
         the form is at the HARM office, the pilot in command must contact the HARM office to make
         corrections.

           office that processes and files the original forms.
      5    The base of the unit of aircraft assignment.
AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
      1    Date. Use numerical digits for year, month, and day. The date must be the Greenwich Mean
           Time (GMT) date. Example- 20050325
      6    Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
      7    Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the same GMT
           date on a single AFTO Form 781.
      8    International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where the
           aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL." Use
           “XXXX” for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier (i.e. a
           CV-22 landing in a field).
      9    Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is terminated
           without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL." Use “XXXX” for classified
           locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.
      10   24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move forward on
           takeoff roll.
      11   24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after being
           airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are stopped and
           shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The aircraft has been on the
           ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series of practice landings is
           considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where a crewmember enplanes or
           deplanes. NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT and ends after GMT midnight
           (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is
           not necessary.
      12   Subtract takeoff time from landing time, convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
           The conversion table for minutes to tenths of an hour is on the reverse of the form.
      13   Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
      14   Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to landing as
           described in block 11; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the sortie will be recorded
           on the flight that lists final landing.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                   109


ITEM        ENTER
    15      Specified by MAJCOM.
    16      Unit designated to perform this mission (MAJCOM option).
 TOTALS Total flight time, landings, and sorties at the end of the mission or day.
    17      Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying. Use
            leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
    18      SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in time being lost or credited to
            another crewmember.
    19      Crewmember’s last name (printed).
    20      Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
            mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual’s current qualification, but will
            indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the mission. For
            example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a mission, the
            individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3. for a
            complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will not match the
            scheduled duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the
            reason in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to
            perform IP duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the
            upgrading individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties.
            MP is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
            When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and annotate
            in remarks if different from the FA.

            in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
    31      Hours and tenths of time performed while wearing night vision goggles.
    32      Air Reserve Component Flight Duty Status Code for the crewmember, if applicable. If
            used: 1=Active Duty, 2=Unit Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), 3=Flying Training Period
            (Inactive Period), 4=Civilian Technician. Include separate lines to record the flying time
            accomplished in each Flying Duty Status Code.

A2.4. Extract AFTO Form 781. Each individual on the form whose flight records are maintained by
another HARM office prepares a data extract copy of the original AFTO Form 781 to be sent, usually
within five duty-days, to that member’s HARM office. If more than one individual named on the form is
serviced by the HARM office, a single data extract copy may be used. For example Captain Grengs, a
pilot from Minot AFB, flew a mission at Grand Forks AFB. A copy of the AFTO Form 781 is made, cer-
tified, and sent to the HARM office at Minot. Extracts at the same base for aircrew members serviced by
the same HARM office are not authorized.
A2.4. (AMC) The data extract AFTO IMT 781 will be an exact copy (back and front) of the original
AFTO IMT 781. The statement “True Certified Extract” and the certifying official’s signature on the form
must be original signature. The AFTO IMT 781 may be faxed to the HARM for input. Make sure that
both the front and back are faxed to the HARM for input.
      A2.4.1. Individuals whose flight records have been closed out to transfer custody must prepare a data
      extract form for each authorized flight during that period.
      A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
      A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member's servicing HARM office personnel will lightly line
      through individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database, leaving only the
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        111


   members they will enter in ARMS. The HARM office responsible for management of the original
   AFTO Form 781 will have a line lightly drawn through members who were extracted (not from air-
   craft's home station).
   A2.4.4. The data extract form is so identified and certified, either by a commissioned officer (prefer-
   ably the pilot in command), a government civilian (when pilot in command), or by the HARM Chief/
   Superintendent.
   A2.4.5. See Attachment 4 for an extract authorized for non-operational, long TDYs.

A2.5. Privacy Act Advisement for AFTO Form 781. Personnel who furnish personal information for
completing the AFTO Form 781 are advised to read the Privacy Act Statement on the back of the form.
Due to multiple SSNs on the form, reproduction for personal use/log books is not authorized.

A2.6. AFTO Forms 781 Series. The AFTO Form 781 is used to record operational flight data. Other
forms in the series give detailed information that concerns the status, servicing, and configurations of the
aircraft, or list symbols required to properly complete other forms in the series. Although explained in
detailed in TO 00-20-1, these forms are briefly reviewed to assist aircrew personnel.
   A2.6.1. AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Used to document
   each discrepancy discovered by the pilot, other crewmembers, or maintenance personnel. It must be
   checked by the pilot before flight to provide a general status review of the aircraft. Use this form to
   enter any discrepancies discovered and not previously reported.

OPERATIONS NOTES:
1. For the P, R, and C mission symbols, use the following third character suffixes to identify missions
flown by specific MAJCOM: AMC use A, B, C; ACC use D, E, F; USAFE use G, H, I, J; PACAF use
K, L, M; AFSOC use N, O, P; ANG use Q, R, S; and AFRC use T, U, V; AETC use W, X, Y and AFMC
use Z. Guard and Reserve units will coordinate with their gaining MAJCOM to determine if the Guard/
Reserve or active duty MAJCOM suffix will be used. MAJCOMs will provide AF/A3O-AT a copy of
directives on the use of these mission symbols.
2. For all missions flown in designated combat areas, make the third character an A to differentiate those
combat missions where aerial delivery/recovery of airborne forces/equipment, ordnance expended, or
direct exposure to hostile fire occurred. The suffix B is used on designated combat missions established
by HQ USAF that result in personnel tour curtailment or other personnel actions.

      A2.6.6. Flight Authorization Duty Codes.
      Flight authorization duty codes identify the aircrew member's flight duty status. They are four (or
      more) letter codes and MAJCOMs have the option to specify the third, fourth and any additional char-
      acters.
         A2.6.6.1. (Added-AMC) The first character of the Flight Authorization Duty Code indicates the
         type of duty crewmembers are authorized to perform on a particular mission. This will not neces-
         sarily be the crewmember’s highest crew qualification, unless specifically required by the mission
         profile.
      A2.6.7. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3TA and A3TK will monitor all standard event identifiers for
      continuation (flying) and additional (ground) training for AMC. All MDS-unique training event iden-
      tifiers will be the responsibility of the operations training series OPR.

         Rated Officers and CEAs authorized non-crew in-flight duty.
      To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with the
      following:
1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to credit
   time (a "yes" in column 3).
2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable when the
   evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew certification code
   O or X.
3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When not per-
   forming primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support medical technicians on AOs
   will only log primary time when performing in-flight medical assistance to actual patients. Only
   other time is authorized for periods of the mission when medical assistance is not being provided.
   EXCEPTIONS: AFSPC and AETC medics will log primary time for that portion of the mission
   when they perform required temporary CEA duties on aircraft equipment (hoists and litters). See
   also paragraph 3.4.1.1.5.
5. Non-interference flyers (other than flying unit commanders and UAS sensor operators) must
   receive AF/A3O-AT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into ARMS.
   See paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2. and 3.3.1.5.3.
6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position “Z” when tasked to perform
   in-flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back side of the AFTO
   Form 781 to explain the duty performed.
NOTE: MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental guidance.

Table A2.4. (Added-AMC) AMC Pilot Designation Codes
HQ AMC mandated (with introduction of the MPD program) to phase out co-pilots and first pilots. That is,
there will only be Pilots (FP), Aircraft Commanders (MP), Instructor Pilots (IP), and Evaluator Pilots (EP).
This caused the need to standardize requirements, terminology, and processes as much as is practical. FP
designates a qualified pilot (including qualification from a previous aircraft) and the 3rd letter designators
will further distinguish the pilot’s qualification status. The codes FC, MC, and FP (without third character)
will no longer be used.
 If first two are
                  Qualified Pilot. Then 3rd character is:
       “FP”
                                 Qualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This is used for the following:
                               1. Pilot currently in ACIQ, ACQ, or PCO course and has not completed
                               qualification checkride.

                               ready training.
                               3. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduate. MDS specific Vol. 1 guidance
                               applies to level of supervision/mission capability.
                               Qualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This is used for the following:
                               1. Graduate of aircraft commander course (ACIQ, ACQ, PCO), in local
                     ”L”
                               mission ready training.
                               2. Pilots designated “E” level for continuation training.
                               Qualified Mission Ready (MR) Traditional Co-Pilot (Non-MPD); replaces

                                PREPARING AERONAUTICAL ORDERS

A3.1. AO Purpose. AOs are:
      A3.1.1. Published on AF Form 1887, or in an approved computer output format, AOs are used to val-
      idate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize and direct individual
      performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participation in aerial flight or parachute
      duties; to authorize and direct individuals (non-aircrew) to perform non-interference flying duties; and
      to establish or terminate individual entitlement to aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted
      flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), and hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP). HDIP for parachutists must
      specify static or HALO jump requirement and type of HDIP authorized. AOs initiating and authoriz-
      ing aviation/parachutist service will not be effective before the member is medically qualified. This
      form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
NOTE: ARMS AOs are not considered "computer-generated" as stated in AFI 33-328, Administrative
Orders. HARM offices evaluate products and process required changes in ARMS and an Aviation
Resource Manager generates the AO. ARMS no longer produces computer-generated AOs.
      A3.1.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of each
      individual's aviation/parachutist career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM office file sys-
      tem until moved to staging area.
      A3.1.3. Distributed according to Table A3.2..
      A3.1.4. Completed according to Table A3.1. through Table A3.4..
      A3.1.5. Signed by the wing Host Aviation Resource Manager (HARM). The wing HARM must be
      an Aviation Resource Management SNCO (E-7 or above/civilian equivalent [GS-6] or E-7/GS-7 or
      above for ANG) with a seven (7) skill level, with at least three years experience in the 1C0 career
      field, a current CHARM qualification, and SEI Code 066. NOTE: The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional
      Manager may waive this requirement. All waiver requests will include full justification, proof of
      member’s qualification (copy of 1C0 training record AO task certification), and expected get well
      date. Send an information copy to AF/A3O-ATF for waivers approved for longer than 180 days.
      A3.1.5. (AMC) The Wing 1C0X2 Functional Manager will send waiver requests along with justifica-
      tion prior to a member’s appointment as the Wing Host Aviation Resource Manager. Waiver requests
      will include a start date in addition to the expected get well date.
         A3.1.5.1. With approval of the MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager and subject to the qualifica-
         tion requirements listed in paragraph A3.1.5., the assistant CHARM may sign aeronautical orders
         on behalf of the CHARM. Additionally, the statement "Signed for" must be written or typed above
         the signature block and the assistant CHARM will sign his or her name above the CHARM’s sig-
         nature block. The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager will document this approval.
NOTE: The only authentication stamp authorized on AOs is the CSAF stamp on Department of the Air
Force AOs.

A3.2. AO Publication. Publish AOs for:
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                        123


   A3.2.1. Officers and CEAs qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers, officers in fly-
   ing training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, or enlisted members in flying training leading
   to the CEA designation) to:
       A3.2.1.1. Start or stop the requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty.
       A3.2.1.2. Direct and record changes to ASC and incentive pay entitlement. When the AO initiates
       or terminates flight/jump pay at the same time as the ASC change, complete the bottom portion of
       the AO. This serves as a Military Pay Order (MPO) to start and stop flight/jump incentive pay.
       HARM offices will use a DD Form 114 to start and stop past or future entitlements based on qual-
       ifications or actions not applicable to the current AO. MPOs may be cut as separate documents to
       control privacy act information contained in aeronautical order remarks section.
   A3.2.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to:
       A3.2.2.1. Initiate or terminate member's requirement to perform regular and frequent flight as a
       crewmember.
       A3.2.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC, FAC 4, 5, 6, 8, and E duties and incentive pay enti-
       tlement.
       A3.2.2.3. Establish or terminate member's requirement to perform frequent and regular parachute
       jump duties as a parachutist member.
       A3.2.2.4. Initiate operational support and non-interference flying. Once AO terminates, it is no
       longer in effect. Do not publish an AO to terminate aviation service for these members.
       A3.2.2.5. Track members required to perform UAV sensor operator duties. Termination date will
       be three years from the AO effective date or member’s DOS, whichever occurs first. The AO will
       read as follows: “Initiate Sensor Operator Duties.”
   A3.2.3. Award authorized basic and advanced ratings and badges. AOs that award aeronautical rat-
   ings, aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders.
NOTE: HARM offices may publish AOs for professionally qualified government civilian employees
using AF Form 1887. Do not publish AOs for qualified members of other US military or foreign services
(unless in UFT), or government contractors. Place all members on the unit’s flight authorization. (See
paragraph 1.8..) Validate US military and foreign service members have competent orders (AOs) from
their respective service directing them to perform flying duties. HARM offices may enter other US mil-
itary, foreign service, or government civilian members in ARMS for the purpose of tracking aircrew train-
ing and physical/physiological qualifications when the member will perform flying duties on a frequent
basis.

A3.3. General Instructions.
   A3.3.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit HARM offices,
   commanders (including unit commanders) and AF/A3O-AT.
       A3.3.1.1. Number AOs in sequential order, starting with number one for each fiscal year. Cite,
       above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order published the previous
       year. For example: "FY06. Last AO was #2140."
124                                                            AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


             A3.3.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to include
             regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number must be accounted for (log
             required), from the first order through the last order published for that fiscal year. Multiple
             logs and numbers (with letters added) are not authorized.
             A3.3.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources) which supports
             each order’s publication must be maintained for each fiscal year IAW AFMAN 37-123. Anno-
             tate (in ink) the background material in the lower right-hand corner (bottom margin of page) to
             show the order number to which it pertains. For example: “Supporting document (or back-
             ground material) for AO # 0469, dated 15 Dec 2005.”
                 A3.3.1.1.2.1. Source documents include information from personnel database interfaces,
                 military identification cards, finance system documents, re-enlistment papers, etc. Do not
                 use documents that transferred dates or information from one source document to
                 another—use the source. If using information logged on a member’s in-processing or
                 out-processing checklist, for example DDLDS or Effective Date of Duty to process AOs,
                 the HARM office will request a MILPDS interface and validate the data for processing the
                 AO.
             A3.3.1.1.3. Post each amendment AO to the HARM office record set and FRF/JRF. Post
             revocation AOs to the HARM office record set only. Enter an explanation in ink on the left
             margin of the original order. For example: "Revoked by AO #2424, dated 18 Sep 05."
         A3.3.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in the written order
         the date and by whom the verbal order was issued and, if flying/jump status or aeronautical rat-
         ings/badges were affected, a statement why written orders were not issued earlier. For example,
         "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written
         orders in advance."
      A3.3.2. Unit commanders will notify the HARM office to request aviation or parachutist service
      actions that originate at the unit level. For example: Initiating aviation/parachutist service, non-inter-
      ference flying, or operational support requests.
      A3.3.3. The host base Information Management (IM) office will provide reproduction facilities for
      publishing AOs when facilities are not available within the HARM office.
      A3.3.4. HARM offices may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members providing
      the action is exactly the same for each member. For group orders, mask information protected under
      the Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
      A3.3.5. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual, pro-
      vided all actions have the same effective and termination dates. EXCEPTION: AOs awarding basic
      or advanced aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions.
      A3.3.6. Use AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO.
         A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper grade,
         termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is unaffected by the cor-
         rection. The amendment order should contain the original effective date and only other required
         identifying data (name, grade, SSN, and organization) and the amended data. If other personal
         data is the same as the AO being amended (ASD, ASC, FAC, etc..), it may also be included on the
         AO. Underline amended items and reference the amended item(s) in the AO remarks. (An amend-
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                  125


      ment makes the amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF Form 1887 is the recom-
      mended medium for amending AO because, as an automated system, ARMS automatically
      includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective period of the AO being
      amended. This information may be included if it mirrors the AO being amended. Use of AF Form
      1887 avoids HARM system "work-arounds" that entail entering false date into ARMS. False data
      may interface with other Air Force systems and corrupt promotion or assignment processes.
         A3.3.6.1.1. HARM offices may use a single amendment AO to correct erroneous data on
         more than one AO if the data to be changed is the same on each incorrect AO. EXAMPLE: A
         HARM office does not amend the ASD and termination date on AOs following an ASD
         adjustment. This may be corrected by publishing one AO to correct the ASD and termination
         date and listing each AO number that required correction in the remarks section of the amend-
         ment AO.
         A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke the
         incorrect amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
         A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to change
         a termination date. In this case, the AO’s intent was incorrect from the beginning. When
         amending an AO, document in ink the AO number and request date of the amendment AO on
         the lower left-hand margin of the original AO in the record set and FRF being amended. For
         example: “Amended by AO #13, dated 13 Oct 05.”
         A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an effective date. Since the intent
         of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective date), an incorrect AO
         effective date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM offices must revoke the AO and
         publish a new AO with the correct effective date and the required aviation service change.
NOTE: HARM offices are authorized to amend other HARM offices’ AOs (provide copy to original
office).
         A3.3.6.1.5. (Added). HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an erroneous OFDA
         total or FAC unless the AO was published to mark an aviation service point, e.g. 12 years of
         aviation service, or to assign FAC 6/E, respectively.
         A3.3.6.1.6. (Added). HARM offices will not amend a past AO solely to correct an erroneous
         authority paragraph reference. The authority paragraph reference must be correct on the mem-
         ber's current AO.
      A3.3.6.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same item on pre-
      vious orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same effective date. Example:
      MSgt Jones', (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will terminate 27 December 2005. However,
      MSgt Jones reenlists on 15 Dec 2005, and will remain on active flying status. An AO must be
      printed to reflect the new termination date based on the new DOS; the effective date of the new
      AO will remain the same as the original AO that placed MSgt Jones on flying status.
      A3.3.6.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A revocation
      deletes the order from the chronological history in the member’s FRF or JRF.) However, the
      revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs to support the AO being
      published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. Do not revoke a
      revocation; instead, publish a new order. For Example: When the HARM office publishes AO
126                                                          AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007


         #2424 to revoke AO #444. Remove AO #444 from the FRF and file AO #2424 in the HARM
         office record set. Document revoked information on the lower left-hand side margin of revoked
         AO. For example: Revoked by AO #167, dated 18 Jan 03. HARM offices must send a copy of
         both AOs to the member and AFPC/DPAOY. AFPC/DPAOY maintains a permanent file in mem-
         ber’s historical file to show all aviation service actions processed.
NOTE: If a revoked AO is the MPO source document, it may be moved to the MPO section of the FRF;
however, it will not be filed in the chronological AO portion of the FRF.
         A3.3.6.4. (Added-AMC) If an AO is published for an ASC of 04, use a DD FORM 114, Military
         Pay Order to stop an individual’s flight pay. When an AO of ASC 04 is revoked, use a DD Form
         114 to start an individual’s flight pay retroactive to the original date of suspense.

A3.4. Restrictions on Publication.
      A3.4.1. Do not publish an AO to authorize Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National
      Guard (ANG) personnel to take part in flight activity during short periods of EAD. EXCEPTION:
      AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while attending the Flight Screening Program.
      A3.4.2. The AO effective date will not precede the date the member met all eligibility requirements.
      A3.4.3. Prior to publication of an AO that will involuntarily terminate aviation service for non-CEA
      enlisted aircrew members, the HARM office must ensure the member was given a 120-day notifica-
      tion before removal from aviation service (IAW AFI 11-402). Receipt of assignment notification doc-
      umentation from the MPF, as directed by AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, verbal
      orders of the member’s unit commander (written confirmation must be received within three
      duty-days), or any official documentation received from AF/A3O-AT constitutes certification and will
      be noted in remarks of the published order. Place MPFs on distribution for all such AOs.
      A3.4.4. AOs should not be published later than the effective date if the action changes, initiates, or
      terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless:
         A3.4.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the effective date is
         the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as provided by the MPF. A retro-
         active statement is not necessary for this action. HARM offices will verify DDLDS documented
         on the member’s in-processing sheet with MILPDS data.
         A3.4.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an effective date of AO.
         Cite the governing directive that applies as authority.
AFI11-401_AMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2007                                                                     127

                         flight and jump may both be applicable.
                         b. If the individual’s entitlement to incentive pay is affected by publishing the
                         AO, so indicate by checking the appropriate block, “is authorized” or “is not
                         authorized.”
                         c. Check the “is not affected” block when the specific actions on the order do
                         not result in a change in the entitlement status of the individual.

                     ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A4.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight training and
space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in missions. This form
is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or aircrew logging space time. Air-
crew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an exact copy of the original AFTO Form
781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating
in ARMS. This is an official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated
officer and enlisted members required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving
combat/combat support operations. The original AF Form 3520, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
Extract, must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.

A4.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated, CEA, and
other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while attending training to
attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized flights in non-USAF aircraft
(includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Individual
Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as
source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.

A4.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting
these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION,
          AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use of USAF
aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to perform in-flight
duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of utility, fighter, and trainer aircraft for missions that
originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to authorize all other aircraft missions and
for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical documents used during mission review to validate
duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form 781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses.
Forms are available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
A5.1. (AMC) All AMC units will use the AF IMT 4327a, Flight Authorization to authorize the use
of USAF aircraft to perform specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members to perform
in-flight duties.
   A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew duties (except
   for noninterference fliers, and ACMs when specifically authorized [see paragraph A5.1.3.]) must be
   listed on a passenger manifest.
   A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight aircrew
   duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the aircraft, but not
   performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. ACMs and non-interference fliers not on AOs may
   be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not listed on the FA, these individuals will be placed on
   the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger manifest combined account for all personnel on the air-
   craft.
       A5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) Responsibilities. Cite MEGP approval in TDY travel orders, or
       approval authority letter. The following is a sample statement: “MEGP status is authorized by
       (appropriate OG/CC or AMC/A3T) on group or individual authorizations include (Rank and
       Name, DSN) to be revalidated every 120 days. End the statement with name and phone number of
       individual approving MEGP status. MEGP authority may also be cited in a letter or message using
       this statement.
NOTE: Approved MEGPs may be placed on the Flight Authorization in the REMARKS section using a
duty position of “MEGP” for the purpose of maintaining billeting and transportation integrity with the air-
crew only. They will not be annotated on the AFTO Form 781.
   A5.1.3. Units may use computer-generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in lieu of the
   actual form program. If used, computer-generated forms must duplicate AF forms located at the
   AFDPO e-publishing web site.

A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of USAF
aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and AE, pararescue
unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout flight authorizations for
aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform aircrew duties on the mission.

A5.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation Resource
Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing Go/No-Go valida-
tion (review of ARMS products and member’s AOs) during pre-mission review.
      A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the authenticating
      official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No-Go requirements are accomplished by
      validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to flight.
      A5.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review to
      ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to perform duties.
      The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on the FA (Duty Position)
      and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.
      A5.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with other mission paperwork. The Air Force Records
      Disposition Schedule (RDS) lists the minimum disposition requirements of this form. MAJCOM sup-
      plements may require longer retention times for the form.
