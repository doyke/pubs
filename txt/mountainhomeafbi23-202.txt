is used in conjunction with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management, and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. It
establishes local manufacture procedures and identifies specific responsibilities for requesting
and fabricating activities and the Flight Service Center (FSC). It designates approval authorities,
documentation requirements and routing procedures. This instruction applies to all Mountain
Home AFB (MHAFB) units submitting local manufacture requests to the 366th Logistics
Readiness Squadron (366 LRS). Ensure all records (e.g., MHAFB Forms 8; Air Force (AF)
Forms 601 and 2005, Department of Defense (DD) Forms 1348-6, work orders, drawings,
blueprints, appointment letters, etc.) created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication

     Manager has local manufacture approval authority for:
        2.1.1. Stock listed items coded for local manufacture (Source of Supply (SOS) JBD or
        Illustrated Parts Breakdown Source Maintenance Repair (SMR) Code MF* or AF* with
        acquisition advice code (AAC) F).
        2.1.2. Nonstock listed items to be made per technical order (TO)/drawing specification.
     2.2. The 366th Maintenance Group Commander/Deputy Commander (366 MXG/CC/CD) is

     requests required to facilitate their section’s production. Maintenance performed by these
     sections requires extensive use of custom made templates, patterns, forming and holding
     fixtures, hardware extraction/installation tools and alignment devices on a routine basis.
     Manufacture of these items is covered in their technical training, Career Development Course
     books, general methods and procedural TO (reference AFI 21-101, paragraph 11.19.).

     capability (MICAP), 366 MXG/CC can approve a one-time manufacture of item based on
     justification provided. MICAP local manufactures will be processed IAW AFMAN 23-110,
     Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, Attachment 11C13 and Air Combat Command Instruction
     (ACCI) 23-251, Combat Oriented Supply Organization Policy, paragraph 4.7.. Supply
     document number associated with this transaction will be required when processing local
     manufacture request. When requesting items, approval will not be granted solely on local
     procurement versus material costs or availability through normal supply channels. Man-
     hours required to complete the project and equipment availability will also be considered
     during approval process.
     3.2. Complete the MHAFB Form 8, Equipment Action Request (Attachment 2), and submit
     the request through the appropriate agency. The MHAFB Form 8 is located on Mountain
