                                          Chapter 2

           PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW

2.1. AF FAP. The FAP develops, implements, and evaluates programs and policies to prevent
and treat family maltreatment. The FAP provides expert training and consultation services to its
key customers, including Airmen and their families, AF leaders, and other AF helping agencies.
AF FAP collects, maintains, analyzes, and reports data on family maltreatment. In concert with
installation and community agencies, the AF FAP provides a continuum of services designed to
build community health and resilience by reducing family maltreatment. The AF FAP promotes
family, community, and mission readiness.
2.1. (JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP) AF FAP. The FAP provides expert training
and consultation services to its key customers, including Airmen, Soldiers and Sailors and their
families; Air Force, Army and Navy leaders; and other JB helping agencies.
   2.1.1. Providing services to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
       2.1.1.1. This instruction applies to all military and civilian AF personnel and their
       dependents entitled to receive medical care in a MTF as specified in AFI 44-115;
       including reservists and their families. Collaboration between FAP staff and reserve
       personnel is highly encouraged and may include consultation, one-time emergency
       evaluations, referrals, prevention, and education. Any duty to warn requirements must
       result in a timely referral to the appropriate non-military authority.
       2.1.1.2. The Air Force Reserve Command does not maintain a separate reserve FAP.
       Efforts to minimize family maltreatment and its effect on mission readiness to reserve
       forces are limited to preventive education, identification, emergency intervention, and
       referrals, when indicated. Allegations of family maltreatment involving reserve airmen
       and/or their families (not eligible for care in a MTF) are routinely managed by civilian
       agencies in conjunction with civilian law enforcement organizations.
2.2. FAP Components. The FAP is comprised of three principal components: Prevention
(Prevention/Outreach Program, NPSP, and FAST), Maltreatment Intervention, and Research and
Evaluation.
   2.2.1. The Prevention/Outreach Program is the focal point for family maltreatment education
   and training to leaders, agencies, and the community. The program includes secondary
   prevention programs for at-risk families. The FAOMs are masters level social workers,
   prevention team leaders, and community liaisons. They coordinate FAP marketing,
   community outreach, and collaboration services. The FAOM is the FAP representative to the
   IDS.
   2.2.2. The installation FAP prevention team collaborates with key community leaders, the
   IDS, and other helping agencies to provide services that enhance the resilience of AF
   communities and reduce the incidence of family maltreatment. FAP prevention services
   include Prevention/Outreach, the NPSP, and FAST. FAP Prevention/Outreach coordinates
   and implements primary and secondary prevention services that include education and
   psychosocial skills training, advocacy, collaboration, community intervention, referral to
   community resources, and marketing.
AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                      21


   2.2.3. The NPSP is a secondary prevention program that uses an intensive, voluntary home
   visitation model to provide education and supportive services to families with children from
   birth to three years of age, including the prenatal period. Services are provided primarily by
   Registered Nurses (RNs), augmented by social workers. NPSP services capitalize on
   parents’ strengths and are provided in a manner sensitive to cultural differences.
   Involvement of both parents in NPSP services is promoted, when applicable.
   2.2.4. Family Advocacy Strength-based Therapy (FAST) offers brief intervention and
   support to couples and families at risk of family maltreatment who do not meet eligibility
   criteria for NPSP.
   2.2.5. Maltreatment Intervention: Provides comprehensive family assessment, intervention,
   and case management to all eligible beneficiaries where there is an alleged incident(s) of
   family maltreatment. FAP providers collaborate with other medical and mental health
   professionals, community service providers, and the various FAP management teams to
   provide optimal care and service coordination to their clients.
   2.2.6. Research and Evaluation: FAP sponsors targeted and system-wide research and
   evaluation of prevention and intervention services. Research projects are conducted through
   collaborative partnerships with military and civilian researchers who understand the unique
   needs of military families. Projects are selected based on their potential to inform and
   improve FAP programs and practices. The Central Registry staff maintains a database on
   family maltreatment cases. Statistical reports are generated from Central Registry data to
   assess trends, respond to OSD, DoD, AF senior leaders, and media queries and provide
   opportunities for process outcome and compliance improvement. A significant proportion of
   FAP research is conducted for the purpose of program evaluation, accountability, and quality
   assurance.
2.3. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure program effectiveness, the following key
features will exist as a part of each installation FAP:
   2.3.1. A FAP Installation Instruction (Supplement to AFI 40-301) and MTF operating
   instructions (OIs) for implementation of the FAP are required. This guidance will address
   local policies and unique circumstances impacting FAP implementation. All first responder
   agencies and medical personnel should coordinate on these documents, which should
   describe local processes for preventing, identifying, assessing, and intervening in cases with
   family maltreatment and responding to high risk prevention cases.
   2.3.2. A FAPAP developed by the FAO and FAP staff, which includes a FAP Marketing
   Plan. The FAPAP will be approved and monitored by the FAC.
   2.3.3. MOUs developed between FAP and key civilian agencies, (e.g., civilian CPS Agency,
   domestic violence shelter, and domestic abuse victim advocate (DAVA) services).
   2.3.4. A duress system and written office safety policy, which include procedures for
   maintaining safety in the FAP office(s) and in the field during home visits and outreach
   activities.
   2.3.5. FAP records created for each family assessed for family maltreatment, or receiving
   clinical secondary prevention services requiring documentation. These records will be
   maintained IAW USAF FAP Standards.

   2.3.6. Functional and up-to-date applications of the electronic data systems provided by AF
   FAP including the FASOR, FAPNet, NPSP module, and OPAL.

maltreatment prevention and intervention to provide civilian staffing for FAP. The staff may be
hired through the civil service or contract, dependent upon available authorizations and funding.
   2.4.1. Civilian FAP staff will not provide Special Needs (SN) Identification and Assignment
   Coordination services. All FAP staff support and participate in maltreatment prevention
   services.

   after hours duties for civilian employees they fund. The central funding is for regular pay
   and additional costs, if any, will be borne by the installation. Managers will follow locally
   established procedures for obtaining additional local funding prior to assigning additional
   hours to these employees or request written exception/approval of funds from AF FAP.
   Civilian employees whose positions are funded by AF FAP cannot participate in after-hours,

4.6. Domestic Abuse Victim Advocates (DAVAs).
   4.6.1. DAVAs should be available to AF victims of domestic abuse 24/hrs a day 7 days a
   week. Where installation FAP resources cannot sustain a DAVA, the FAO will ensure
   domestic abuse advocate services are provided through MOU(s) with local civilian domestic
   abuse advocate services.
   4.6.2. During non-duty hours, AF DAVA services will be accessed through the Mental
   Health provider on call.
   4.6.3. AF DAVAs will provide supportive services to victims as described in DoD guidance
   and the AF FAP standards.
4.7. Domestic Abuse Reporting Options. Adult victims of domestic abuse have two reporting
options: unrestricted reporting and Restricted Reporting (RR). Regardless of whether the victim
elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be
maintained IAW the HIPAA.
   4.7.1. Unrestricted Reporting for Domestic Abuse. Unrestricted reporting is a process
   allowing a victim of domestic abuse to report an incident using chain of command, law
   enforcement or AFOSI Detachment, and Family Advocacy for clinical intervention. Victims
   of domestic abuse who choose to pursue an official command or criminal investigation of an
   incident should use these reporting channels. Upon notification of a reported domestic abuse
   incident, DAVA (where available) and FAP clinical services will be offered to the victim. At
   the victim’s request, the medical provider, in coordination with criminal investigators, will
   conduct a forensic medical examination. Details regarding the incident will be limited to
   only those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.
   4.7.2. Restricted Reporting (RR) for Domestic Abuse.
       4.7.2.1. RR is a process allowing an adult victim of domestic abuse, who is eligible to
       receive military medical treatment (including civilians and contractors who are eligible to
       receive military healthcare outside the CONUS on a reimbursable basis) the option of
       reporting an incident of domestic abuse to specified individuals for the purpose of receiving
       medical care, supportive services, and/or advocacy and information without initiating the
       investigative process or notification to the victim’s or alleged offender’s CC.
          4.7.2.1.1. When sexual assault occurs between spouses or unmarried intimates it is
          domestic violence and will be managed by FAP.
          4.7.2.1.2. Once FAP assumes case management of domestic abuse sexual assault
          cases, no information about the case is shared with the SARC without the client’s
          consent.
       4.7.2.2. When an adult victim elects RR, and discloses an abuse allegation to a DAVA,
       or healthcare provider (including FAP staff), the domestic abuse allegation may not be
       disclosed to command or civilian or military investigative or law enforcement agencies
       except as provided in the exceptions to this RR policy or mandated by state law.
       4.7.2.3. Victims who make a domestic abuse RR inquiry to Military One Source, NPSP
       staff, or the SARC will be referred to a FAP provider, who will assist the victim with the
       reporting process.
AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                     33


     4.7.2.4. If the victim discloses a domestic abuse allegation in the presence of the alleged
     offender, the RR option does not apply.
     4.7.2.5. For purposes of command responsibility and in the interest of gathering accurate
     data, information concerning RRs of domestic abuse, without personal identifiers, will be
     reported by the FAO at the next FAC meeting. This will inform installation leadership as
     to the number and type of domestic abuse incidents within the command and enhance the
     CC’s ability to provide a safe environment. If the installation leadership wants to be
     notified of DA RRs sooner than the next FAC, the FAO will supply the required
     information as requested.
     4.7.2.6. The medical provider will initiate appropriate care and treatment and will report
     the domestic abuse only to a DAVA or FAP. At the victim’s request, the medical
     provider will conduct/arrange any forensic medical examination deemed appropriate.
     The forensic component includes gathering information from the victim for the medical
     forensic history, an examination, documentation of biological and physical findings,
     collection of evidence from the victim, and follow-up, as needed, to document additional
     evidence. The medical provider will transfer the forensic evidence, via proper evidence
     chain of custody procedures, to an AFOSI Detachment agent using a control number in
     lieu of personal identifying information.
        4.7.2.6.1. All RRs that have physical evidence associated with them will be assigned
        a Restricted Report Control Number (RRCN) by a FAP provider. The RRCN will be
        developed using a two-digit year, two-digit month, the first four letters of the
        installation name, a three-digit numerical sequence, and followed by “R-FAP.” For
        example, “0709RAND001R FAP” represents the incidence occurred in 2007, during
        September, at Randolph AFB, is the first report of this sequence, and is a restricted
        report.
        4.7.2.6.2. DAVAs or FAP providers have no responsibility for the collection of
        physical evidence when a restricted report has been made. DAVAs or FAP providers
        will not collect or receive physical evidence of domestic violence from a victim.
        4.7.2.6.3. The local AFOSI detachment is responsible for taking custody of the
        physical evidence from Healthcare Personnel and will log, store and preserve the

        evidence storage period. The FAP will appropriately document the efforts to obtain a
        decision from the victim or efforts to locate the victim. The FAP is authorized to
        complete any documentation required from AFOSI for the destruction of evidence on
        behalf of the victim. The evidence will be destroyed at the one-year anniversary date

     4.7.2.8. The victim will acknowledge in writing his/her understanding that RR will limit
     the government’s ability to prosecute the alleged offender in a domestic abuse incident by
     signing the USAF Family Advocacy Victim Reporting Preference Statement
     (Attachment 5) after all available reporting options, exceptions and limitations are
     explained to the victim by the FAP staff member.
     4.7.2.9. Documentation of a RR is maintained in a Family Advocacy Restricted Report
     Maltreatment Record. If the Victim Reporting Preference Statement is completed by
     someone other than a FAP provider, a copy will be submitted to FAP for the Family

     4.7.3.1. In cases in which a victim elects RR, the prohibition on disclosing covered

     4.7.3.2. A present or past risk for danger does not necessarily equate to a serious and
     imminent threat in a case. FAP must use the totality of the facts and apply professional
     judgment as a result. In assessing the risk of imminent harm to the victim, and the
     potential for escalation of violence the FAP clinician and /or DAVA should weigh the
     existence and frequency of the following risk factors:
         4.7.3.2.1. Victimization patterns have increased in severity or frequency.
         4.7.3.2.2. Alleged offender threatened or attempts to kill the victim or his/her

        extreme dominance.

     4.7.3.3. FAP and any other agencies authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse
     or neglect when, as a result of the victim’s disclosure, the DAVA or FAP has a
     reasonable belief that child abuse has also occurred. However, disclosure will be limited
     only to information related to the child abuse.
     4.7.3.4. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a healthcare
     provider is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to
     only that information necessary to process the disability retirement determination.
     4.7.3.5. Supervisors of the DAVA, FAP, or medical provider when disclosure is required
     for the purposes of supervision of direct victim treatment or services.
     4.7.3.6. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when a military, federal, or
     state judge issues a subpoena or order for the covered communications to be presented to
     the court or to other officials or entities, when the judge orders such disclosure.
     4.7.3.7. To other officials or entities when required by federal or state statute or
     applicable U. S. international agreement.
     4.7.3.8. Healthcare providers may also convey to the victim’s CC, if applicable,
     information on any possible adverse duty impact related to an AD victim’s medical
     condition and prognosis. Such circumstances, however, do not otherwise warrant an
     exception to policy and therefore, the specific details of the domestic abuse incident will
     still be treated as covered communication and may not be disclosed.
     4.7.3.9. If the DAVA or FAP provider believes that disclosure is required, pursuant to
     one of the exceptions, the DAVA or FAP provider shall first consult with his or her
     supervisor and JA prior to disclosure. When there is uncertainty or disagreement on
36          AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012


     whether an exception applies, the matter will be referred to the installation CC for
     resolution.
     Note: When the exception to RR relates to an imminent risk of harm to a victim or other,
     the FAP will act to ensure the safety of those involved, disclosing the minimal amount of
     information necessary to allow for an informed coordinated response to the perceived
     threat, will document the rationale for and extent of the disclosure and will consult with
     his/her supervisor and JA at the earliest opportunity.
     4.7.3.10. The DAVA or FAP provider must make every reasonable effort to provide the
     affected victim advance notice of the intention to disclose a covered communication with
     a description of the information to be disclosed, the basis for disclosure, and the
     individual, group, or agency to which it will be disclosed. The disclosure will be limited
     to information necessary to satisfy the purpose of the disclosure in the event the
     disclosure is made under the authority of one of the stated exceptions. Further disclosure
     will not be made unless the domestic abuse victim authorizes the disclosure in writing.
     4.7.3.11. In the event that information about a domestic abuse incident is disclosed to the
     CC or FAP from a source independent of the RR avenues, law enforcement or AFOSI
     Detachment shall also be notified. FAP shall intervene with the family and conduct
     assessments and provide treatment. Additionally, a victim’s disclosure of his or her
     domestic abuse to persons other than those covered by this policy may result in an
     investigation of the allegations by law enforcement and clinical intervention from FAP.
     Consistent with current policy, CCs acquiring information under these circumstances
     about a domestic abuse incident shall immediately notify law enforcement and FAP.
AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                        37

                               DISPOSITION OF PERSONNEL

5.1. Special Duty. FAP involvement alone does not require any duty restriction. For
information about how to assign personnel receiving FAP assistance while performing duties
requiring either the Sensitive Duty Programs, security clearance, access to classified information,
or unescorted entry into restricted areas refer to DoDR5210.42_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear
Weapons Personnel Reliability Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
Management.
5.2. Review of Duty Assignment. CCs must review the duty assignment status of all military
members whose current duties may make it difficult for them to receive Family Advocacy
intervention. Military members considered fit for duty may continue in their primary or control
Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) while involved in FAP intervention, unless precluded under
AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel. If precluded, the CC may assign members under
their secondary or tertiary AFSC during the FAP intervention process.
5.3. Promotion and Retention of Personnel. A member's involvement in the FAP will not be
the sole basis for denying or withholding promotion, retention, or special duty assignments.
5.4. Assignment Availability. Family Maltreatment. AD members receiving intervention
services for family maltreatment who are sufficiently emotionally, psychologically, and
physiologically stable can be assigned to any location that offers appropriate services. If
maltreatment occurs in a family with Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders, the unit CC
should suspend the assignment until evaluations are completed to ensure availability of services
at the gaining base. AD members having an open maltreatment record at the time they receive
PCS orders for an overseas assignment should be processed as a family with SNs for FAP
services from the gaining MTF.

     USAF FAMILY ADVOCACY VICTIM REPORTING PREFERENCE STATEMENT

PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT

AUTHORITY: Section 301 of Title 5 U.S.C. and Chapter 55 of Title 10 U.S.C.

PRINCIPAL PURPOSE(S): Information on this form will be used to document elements of the
abuse response and/or reporting process and comply will the procedures set up to effectively manage
abuse incidents.

ROUTINE USE(S): None

DISCLOSURE: Completion of this form is voluntary; however, failure to complete this form with

1.     Reporting process and options discussed with the Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA)
or Family Advocacy Provider:

I, ____________________________________, had the opportunity to talk with a DAVA or Family
Advocacy Provider before selecting a reporting option.

2.      The following applies to Unrestricted Reporting:

I understand that law enforcement, my or the offender’s chain of command will be notified of my
report that I am a victim of domestic abuse and a law enforcement investigation will occur. I
understand that I can receive medical treatment, advocacy services, support, and counseling. I also
understand that I can request to be separated from the offender, that a military protective order can be
issued to enforce that separation, and that I can also pursue a civilian order of protection through the
local courts.

3.      The following applies to Restricted Reporting:

a.      I understand that I can confidentially receive medical treatment, advocacy services, support,
and counseling. Law enforcement and command will NOT be notified. My report will NOT initiate
an investigation; therefore, no action will be taken against the offender as the result of my report.

b.      I understand that there are exceptions to “Restricted Reporting” (see exceptions in paragraph
4). If an exception applies, limited details of my allegation may be revealed to satisfy the exception.
Further disclosure will not be made unless I authorize the disclosure in writing.

c.     I understand that if I do not choose a reporting option at this time, the commander (or
designated persons within the chain of command) and law enforcement will be notified.
 56             AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012


d.       I understand that state laws, local laws or international agreements may limit some or all of
the restricted reporting protections explained to me. In (state/country) _____________________,
medical authorities must report the abuse to_______________ (if applicable).

e.      I understand that the DAVA or Family Advocacy Provider will provide aggregate and non-
identifying information to command officials. This information will give commanders a clearer
picture as to the number and type of domestic abuse incidents within their command, and enhance the
commanders’ ability to provide an environment that is safe and contributes to the well-being and
mission-readiness of all.

f.       I understand that if I make a “Restricted Report”, after 1 year any evidence collected will be
destroyed and no longer available for any future investigation or prosecution efforts.

g.     I understand that if I talk about my abuse to anyone other than the Health Care Provider
(HCP), DAVA, or Family Advocacy Provider, it may be reported to command and law enforcement
which could lead to an investigation.

h.      I understand that Restricted Reporting does not extend to offenders who seek services.

i.       I understand that the Family Advocacy Provider, DAVA, or HCP, and their supervisors,
may discuss the details of my case to ensure effective delivery of services when receiving
supervision.

j.       I understand that I may change my mind and report the abuse at a later time as an
“Unrestricted Report”, law enforcement and command will be notified. I also understand delayed
reporting may limit the ability to prosecute the alleged offender. If the case goes to a judicial
proceeding, my DAVA and others providing care may be called to testify about any information I
disclosed.

b.    Command officials or law enforcement when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and
imminent threat to the health or safety of the victim or another person.

c.     FAP and any other agencies authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect
when, as a result of the victim’s disclosure, the DAVA or HCP has a reasonable belief that child
abuse has also occurred. However, disclosure will be limited only to information related to the child
abuse.

d.      Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a HCP is required for fitness
for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to only that information which is necessary
to process the disability retirement determination.
AFI40-301_JB-MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                57


e.      Supervisors of the DAVA or HCP when disclosure is required for the supervision of direct
victim treatment or services.

entities when the judge orders such disclosure; or to other officials or entities when required by
Federal or State statute or applicable U. S. international agreement.

5.      Choose a reporting option:

_________       Unrestricted Report: I elect unrestricted reporting and have decided to report that I
am a victim of domestic abuse to law enforcement, command, or other military authorities for
investigation of the incident.

_________       Restricted Report: I elect restricted reporting and have decided to confidentially
report that I am a victim of domestic abuse. Command will NOT be provided with information about
my identity. Law enforcement or other military authorities will NOT be notified unless one of the
exceptions above applies. I understand the information I provide will not start an investigation or be
used to punish the alleged offender with respect to this report. I further understand that choosing
a restricted report will limit the government’s ability to prosecute the alleged offender in this
domestic abuse incident and will also limit FAP and command’s ability to provide the most
comprehensive safety plan.
