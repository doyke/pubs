This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70,
Environmental Quality. It identifies compliance requirements for all solid waste (SW), including
hazardous waste (HW), but excludes radioactive waste (except mixed waste) and medical waste.
This publication applies to units and individuals at all levels who handle and/or manage waste as
described above, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard
(ANG) units, except where noted otherwise. In the United States and its territories, use this
guidance with applicable federal, state, and local laws/regulations and standards for SW and
HW. At installations outside the United States and its territories, implement this AFI consistent
with applicable international agreements, Unified Combatant Command (UCC) policy,
environmental annexes to operational orders or plans, country-specific Final Governing
Standards (FGS), or in their absence, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document
(OEBGD). In case of conflict, UCC policy, the environmental annex, the FGS, or the OEBGD
takes precedence over this AFI. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) listed above using the Air Force Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route Air Force Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional chain of command. Any organization may supplement this
instruction, to include the Major Commands (MAJCOMs), ANG, and AFRC, however direct
supplements must be provided to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
certification and approval. Further, the ANG or AFRC, in coordination with AF/A4C, may
assign adjusted installation-level organizational responsibilities or processes due to
dissimilarities with the way they operate, as long as the intent of the requirements and standard
processes in this AFI are met. Other commands send one copy of each supplement to the next
higher headquarters (HHQ). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
 2                                                                                         AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). For
generation of report(s) as a result of this AFI refer to applicable Reports Control Numbers (RCN)
IAW AFI 33-324. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are
identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, and T-3”) number following the compliance statement.
See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities
associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to
the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-
tiered compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision updates
and replaces AFI 32-7042, Waste Management, 15 April 2009. It complies with AFI 33-360
waiver tier requirements described above and incorporates revised roles and responsibilities
based on Enterprise-Wide Civil Engineer Transformation (PAD 12-03) and associated
Programing Plan (P-Plan).” Air Force-specific policy remains in this AFI, however, additional
and more detailed information can be found in the non-directive process Solid and Hazardous
Waste playbooks respectively published on the Air Force Civil Engineering A4C Portal:

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Concept. Inherent in the mission of the Air Force are the associated environmental
responsibilities of protecting human health and the environment and ably managing the natural
resources whose care has been entrusted to the Air Force. IAW the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), the Air Force program to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste
generated is the Hazardous Materials Management Process (HMMP) described in AFI 32-7086,
Hazardous Material Management. This will be done first through source reduction, e.g.,
chemical substitution, process change, and other techniques to reduce generation of HW. Where
environmentally damaging materials must be used, their use will be minimized. If the use of such
materials cannot be avoided, the spent material or waste will be reused or recycled whenever
feasible. As a last resort, spent material or waste that cannot be reused or recycled must be
disposed of in an environmentally safe manner, consistent with the requirements of all applicable
laws, including RCRA. Solid waste (SW) and hazardous waste (HW) management interrelates,
or has the potential to interrelate, with the management of many other environmental programs
(e.g., air, water, natural resource programs). In addition, the consequences of managing SW and
HW can affect the health and safety of an installation’s workforce. To this end, it is imperative
that the SW and HW management program defined in this AFI be conducted as an integral
component of an installation’s Environmental Management System (EMS), including the
associated Cross-Functional Team (CFT), as defined in higher headquarters’ EMS-related
policies, procedures, and guidance documents.
1.2. Scope. This AFI describes the Air Force’s management of municipal solid waste (MSW),
industrial solid waste, construction and demolition (C&D) debris, hazardous waste, and
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste. This AFI does not address radioactive waste (RW)
(except mixed waste) or medical waste. RW is addressed in AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive
Materials in the Air Force. Medical waste is addressed in AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical
Engineering Programs. Note: Certain medical waste and expired/unused pharmaceuticals
intended to be disposed can meet the definition of HW, and therefore its management is
governed by the RCRA and this AFI.
1.3. Objectives. This instruction provides MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and installations a
framework for complying with standards applicable to SW and HW management. Installations
must also comply with applicable state and local standards. (T-0)
1.4. Applicable Standards and Regulations. The Air Force must comply with applicable
federal, state, and local laws and regulations; Executive Orders (EO); US Department of Defense
(DoD) and Air Force policies; and the OEBGD, appropriate FGS, and international agreements.
See Attachment 2 for list of pertinent statutes and regulations. (T-0)
1.5. Overseas Compliance. Air Force activities in foreign countries must implement this AFI
consistent with applicable international agreements, UCC policy, environmental annexes to
operational orders or plans, and country-specific FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD. In case
of conflict, UCC policy, the environmental annex, the FGS, or the OEBGD takes precedence
over this AFI. In the event of conflict notify HQ USAF/A4C through the appropriate MAJCOM.

1.6. Records Retention. While applicable DoD, federal, and state regulations establish
minimum records retention periods, federal agencies can require longer record retention. The Air
Force           Records          Disposition            Schedule,           located           at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm, prescribes retention periods for
specified hazardous waste documents.

                  HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Section 3A—Planning

3.1. General Requirements.
   3.1.1. HW. A HW is a substance first determined to be a SW, as defined in 40 Code of
   Federal Regulations (CFR) §261.2 that has not been excluded from EPA HW regulations and
   is either a characteristic HW (i.e., ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic) or a listed HW
   (listed on the F, K, P, or U lists at Title 40, CFR, §§261.31-.33), or is identified as a HW by
   authorized state or host nation requirements incorporated into the FGS. Air Force
   installations comply with all applicable HW standards and regulations. There are many
   exceptions to waste being considered RCRA HW, with household waste being one of them.
   This AFI cannot address all exempted wastes.
   3.1.2. Installations submit programming and budgeting needs for facilities, equipment, and
   manpower per AFI 32-7001, Environmental Quality Program, and AFI 65-106,
   Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS). (T-1)
   3.1.3. Installations must have a hazardous waste minimization program to reduce the volume
   and toxicity of waste generated IAW RCRA §3002(b), 42 U.S.C. §6922(b). The
   establishment of the Installation Hazardous Material Program (IHMP) is the Air Force
   method, per AFI 32-7086, to document compliance with this requirement. (T-0)
   3.1.4. Installations with RCRA permits for HW storage, treatment, or disposal must comply
   with conditions included in those permits. In the event of a conflict, permit requirements
   supersede this instruction. (T-0)
   3.1.5. Installations that generate HW must have a HW management program that ensures
   compliance with this instruction and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and
   regulations; executive orders; DoD and Air Force policies; and, if applicable, the OEBGD,
   FGS, and/or international agreements. The program will be documented in the Hazardous
   Waste Management Plan (HWMP). (T-0)
   3.1.6. Installations and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) that qualify as Conditionally
   Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG) under RCRA, and maintain that status for at
   least a year, do not have to meet the Air Force-specific requirements of this Chapter as long
   as they meet the minimum RCRA regulations applicable to CESQG. Exemptions are
   Sections 3.4, 3.8.2, and 3.9.2, which must be considered, regardless of generator status. (T-0)
3.2. Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
   3.2.1. The installation CE will generate a HWMP which will reflect current regulatory
   requirements and installation HW activities. (T-0)
   3.2.2. The installation ESOHC will review and approve the plan annually. (T-1)
   3.2.3. The HWMP must contain, at a minimum, a hazardous waste stream inventory, waste
   analysis plan (WAP), HW management procedures (addressing characterization, turn-in and
 14                                                         AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


   disposal procedures, disposal contracts, inspections, munitions, mixed waste, permits,
   recordkeeping, and host-tenant agreements as warranted), reporting procedures, training plan,
   waste minimization plan, a pollution prevention plan, and a reference to the installation
   emergency preparedness and spill prevention (or equivalent) plan, to include the HW
   contingency plan. The HWMP will reference these applicable plans prepared independent of
   the HWMP.
3.3. Waste Characterization and Identification.
   3.3.1. The HW Generating Activity will coordinate waste generation with the CE to ensure
   that waste streams are properly characterized IAW 40 CFR §261, applicable DoD, state, and
   local regulations, and FGS requirements (or OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS). (T-0)
   3.3.2. The WAP will include hazardous waste streams and set forth procedures, including
   specific sampling methods, necessary to ensure proper HW management.
   3.3.3. The CE will ensure the development/update of a Hazardous Waste Stream Inventory
   (HWSI) describing all HW streams generated. (T-1) HWMPs must have a HWSI that lists at
   least the Generating Activity’s identity and location, unique waste stream number, and the
   waste characteristics (e.g., EPA waste code, and state waste code). EESOH-MIS will be used
   to document the list of HW sites and corresponding streams.
   3.3.4. Installations will document the waste stream description in EESOH-MIS in order to
   generate the DRMS Form 1930, Hazardous Waste Profile Sheet (or electronic equivalent).
   (T-0)
   3.3.5. Universal Waste (UW). Federally designated universal wastes include batteries,
   pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and lamps that qualify as hazardous wastes. These
   items will be managed IAW the UW regulations of the appropriate regulatory agency.
   3.3.6. Mixed Waste (MW). MW consists of waste containing both HW and radioactive
   material.
      3.3.6.1. Installations that generate MW must comply with RCRA HW disposal, Atomic
      Energy Act (AEA), State and USAF disposal requirements. (T-0) MW can be generated
      during nuclear weapons maintenance activities governed under AEA Section 91b. The
      Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) provides 91b policy under AFI 91-108, Air Force
      Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation and 91B Radioactive Material Safety Program.
      Consult AFI 91-108 for nuclear weapons-related MW disposal requirements. Consult
      AFI 40- 201, Managing Radioactive Material in the US Air Force, for RW and MW
      disposal requirements not related to nuclear weapons maintenance. CE will advise on
      RCRA requirements as applicable to storage/handling of MW.
      3.3.6.2. All installations will coordinate the disposal of RW and MW with the
      Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO), who will in turn, coordinate with the Air
      Force Radioactive Recycling and Disposal (AFRRAD) office, 88 ABW/CE, Wright-
      Patterson AFB, OH. The AFRRAD office responsibilities are outlined in AFI 40-201,
      and it is the sole agent for disposal of AF MW and RW. (T-1)
   3.3.7. Military Munitions. All conventional explosive ordnance, whether it remains
   useable/serviceable or has been designated as unserviceable, will be managed IAW DoD
   6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, October 5, 2004, and DoD
AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    15


   Policy to Implement the EPA’s Military Munitions Rule, 1 July 1998, relayed per
   memorandum from HQ USAF/A4 (previously IL), dated November 2, 1998.
      3.3.7.1. Military munitions that are SW or HW for regulatory purposes will be stored and
      disposed of IAW applicable state and federal regulations, DoD and Air Force guidance,
      and the Military Munitions Rule found at 40 CFR §264/265 Subpart EE and §266
      Subpart M as appropriate. (T-0)
3.4. Disposal Contracts.
   3.4.1. Installations will use DLA-DS as the DoD HW disposal agent for routinely generated
   HW or HW from base operations not connected to a specific contract, unless there is a
   compelling reason to use alternative contract disposal or per the exemptions listed in section
   3.4.1.1. Installations may contract for HW disposal if the commander provides appropriate
   justification, and AFCEC/CZ approves the waiver (IAW Sec 2.4.2, NGB/A7 and AFRC/A7
   will approve for ANG and AFRC bases respectively in concert with AFCEC/CZ). (T-1)
      3.4.1.1. HW from contracted cleanup/remediation projects or construction/demolition
      and renovation contracts is not required to go through DLA-DS for disposal. HW, which
      is being considered for recycling, must meet requirements set forth in 40 CFR §261.6.
      HAZMAT that is being recycled or reclaimed IAW 40 CFR §261, is not considered
      disposal. If the regulatory requirements are met, the recycling processes can be
      independently contracted as long as legitimate recycling is consistent with EPA’s P2
      hierarchy (See AFI 32-7001, Chapter 6). For these types of contracts procured locally
      (under the control of installation contracting), the base will comply with appropriate
      requirements of this section to ensure legitimate recycling and compliant recycling
      facilities are being used. (T-0)
      3.4.1.2. All local contracts must be performance-based IAW AFI 63-124, Performance-
      Based Services Acquisition (PBSA). Consult the servicing contracting office for
      assistance. Note: AFI 63-124 does not apply to the Air National Guard. Consult with
      OCS on best approach. (T-0)
      3.4.1.3. Ensure that any local installation contract for HW disposal, as allowed per
      Section 3.4.1.1., will not conflict with provisions of an existing DLA-DS contract or
      result in breach of a DLA-DS contract. (T-0)
      3.4.1.4. Once approved by AFCEC/CZ, all local contract development will be
      coordinated with the contracting officer, Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), and installation
      environmental manager. (T-1)
      3.4.1.5. The SJA and the installation environmental manager will review these
      documents before sending them to the Contracting Officer (CO) to ensure that the
      documents follow applicable DoD, federal, state, and local regulations and requirements.
      (T-0)
      3.4.1.6. The CO, in consultation with the SJA, will determine if the contractor must
      maintain insurance to cover liabilities associated with improper HW transportation,
      treatment, or disposal. At a minimum, contracts should require indemnification of the
      government by the contractor. (T-0)
 16                                                            AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


      3.4.1.7. The evaluation team must evaluate all offerors’ compliance records when
      selecting a source for HW transport and disposal services. Evaluate all proposed HW
      transport contractors in the same manner. (T-0)
3.5. Host-Tenant Support.
   3.5.1. The Air Force supports the HW disposal needs of both Air Force and DoD tenants on
   Air Force installations. (T-1)
   3.5.2. For intra-service support (including Air Force, AFRC, and the ANG), host Air Force
   installations plan for their tenants’ HW disposal needs, unless paragraph 3.5.4 applies. (T-1)
   3.5.3. Tenants must follow all laws and regulations applicable to the installation as well as
   the installation HWMP, and IAW a Host Tenant Agreement, provide input and submit
   reports that the HWMP requires. (T-0)
      3.5.3.1. When tenants do not comply with HW laws, the installation commander may
      take any action needed to require tenants (and their contractors) to comply at no charge to
      the government.
      3.5.3.2. Tenants responsible for HW management facilities that require permitting must
      coordinate with the host-installation. The tenant then signs as operator/generator and the
      installation commander signs as facility owner. (T-0)
   3.5.4. The tenant will reimburse the installation IAW AFI 65-601 Volume 1, Section 7.10,
   for waste disposal costs as documented in a host-tenant agreement. EXCEPTIONS: All
   Defense Working Capitally Funded (DWCF) Air Force tenants and Services activities are not
   eligible for a billing waiver and must pay their operation and maintenance expenses,
   including HW disposal costs. Also, AFI 65-601 requires Air Force Research Laboratory
   (AFRL) workload users and Designated Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) test
   mission proponents to fund the direct costs of activities that are measureable and directly

                                          Chapter 5

       MANAGEMENT OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL (PCB) WASTES

Section 5A—Planning.

5.1. General Concepts.
   5.1.1. PCB bulk product wastes include but are not limited to non-liquid bulk wastes or
   debris generated from the demolition of buildings and other man-made structures
   manufactured, coated, or serviced with PCBs. PCB bulk product wastes also include PCB-
   containing wastes from the shredding of automobiles, household and industrial appliances, or
   other white goods (e.g. household major appliances); PCB impregnated electrical, sound
   deadening, or other types of insulation and gaskets; or fluorescent light ballasts containing
   PCBs in the potting material.
   5.1.2. The PCB waste management program consists of the proper management of target
   PCB equipment, such as transformers and large capacitors containing greater than 50 §§ per
   million (ppm) PCBs.
   5.1.3. The Air Force is committed to eliminating target PCB equipment and reducing future
   liability for cleanup and disposal costs. Such a PCB-free designation, however, does not
   absolve an installation from its PCB management burden. For example, a retro-filled
   transformer, once declared PCB-free, may currently contain PCB in concentration above 50
   ppm due to PCB that has leached back into the oil from the surrounding casing/shell of the
   transformer.
   5.1.4. USAF installations outside the US and US territories will refer to Chapter 14 of the
   OEBGD, or the country-specific FGS, as appropriate, for PCB guidance relevant to those
   installations. (T-0)

Section 5B—Implementation and Operation.

5.2. Recordkeeping.
   5.2.1. Installations will ensure a management program for target PCB equipment, track
   regulated PCB disposal with the EPA PCB manifest (EPA Form 8700- 22, Uniform
   Hazardous Waste Manifest), and report PCB management activities per 40 CFR §61. Forms
   can be obtained through any source that has been approved by the EPA Manifest Registry.
   (T-0)
   5.2.2. The dates when PCBs or PCB items were removed from service must be recorded on
   the manifest or continuation sheet that accompanies the PCB waste to commercial storage
   and disposal facilities. (T-0)
   5.2.3. Generators must keep a copy of the manifest for as long as required by the Air Force
   RDS from the date the PCB waste was accepted by the initial transporter. (T-0)
   5.2.4. Certificates of disposal must be maintained IAW 40 CFR § 761.180(a), except that the
   retention method and period prescribed in the Air Force RDS apply. (T-0)
AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                            27


   5.2.5. Annual document logs must be maintained IAW 40 CFR §761.180(a), except that the
   retention method and period prescribed in the Air Force RDS apply. (T-0)
5.3. PCB Waste Disposal.
   5.3.1. Comply with PCB disposal requirements found at 40 CFR §761 (Polychlorinated
   Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce and Use
   Prohibitions) and applicable state or applicable local regulation. (T-0)
 28                                                          AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 6

                                 MANAGEMENT REVIEW

6.1. Regulatory Agency Noncompliance Actions. The installation CE will review
management action plans to ensure that outstanding enforcement actions are resolved within the
required time frames. Review the response to regulatory agency inspection findings to ensure
process owners take timely corrective actions. In case there is a question of the validity of the
enforcement action or if there is a conflict between the state agency and the installation, the
appropriate Air Force Regional Environmental Office (REO) and AFLOA/JACE (normally
through a Regional Compliance Office) should be consulted as well for issue clarification and/or
liaison with the state. (T-1)
6.2. Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Council. ESOHCs are the appropriate
forum for coordinating SW/HW quality reviews and resource management program corrective
actions that require cross-functional review, deliberation, and approval. ESOHCs will conduct
management reviews to ensure waste management goals are met, implementation and operation
procedures are followed, and assessment findings are tracked and completed. The ESOHC also
ensures program goals are appropriate and produce actions to provide necessary mission
capability and capacity. (T-1)

Terms and Definitions
Acute Hazardous Waste—Waste that EPA has determined to be so dangerous in small amounts
(as listed in 40 CFR §t261.33(e) in the P and U listed items) that they are regulated the same
way, as are large amounts of other hazardous waste.
Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)—Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)
[formerly Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF)] was established on 11 Dec 1996 through
the restructuring of the DBOF into individual component working capital funds. AFWCF
activities sell goods and services to a wide range of customers, including DoD operating forces,
Air Force activities, other US government activities and foreign military sales customers. The
AFWCF activity groups include Depot Maintenance, Supply Management, and Information
Services.
Biosolids—The soil-like residue of materials removed from sewage during the treatment
process. During treatment, bacteria and other tiny organisms break sewage down into simpler,
harmless organic matter. The organic matter combined with bacterial cell masses, settles out to
form biosolids.
Capacitor—A device for accumulating and holding a charge of electricity and consisting of
conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric. Types of capacitors are as follows: (1) Small
capacitor means a capacitor which contains less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. The
following assumptions may be used if the actual weight of the dielectric fluid is unknown. A
capacitor whose total volume is less than 1,639 cubic centimeters (100 cubic inches) may be
 36                                                           AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


considered to contain less than 1.36 kgs (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid and a capacitor whose total
volume is more than 3,278 cubic centimeters (200 cubic inches) must be considered to contain
more than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. A capacitor whose volume is between 1,639 and
3,278 cubic centimeters may be considered to contain less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid
if the total weight of the capacitor is less than 4.08 kg (9 lbs.). (2) Large high voltage capacitor
means a capacitor which contains 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) or more of dielectric fluid and which operates
at 2,000 volts (a.c. or d.c.) or above. (3) Large low voltage capacitor means a capacitor which
contains 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) or more of dielectric fluid and which operates below 2,000 volts (a.c. or
d.c.).
Characteristic Hazardous Waste—A waste which meets the definition of the characteristic of
ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity as specified in 40 CFR §261, Subpart C.
Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG)—These are entities
(installations) which generate in a calendar month: a) no more than 220 lbs. of non-acute
hazardous waste, b) no more than 220 lbs. of acute spill cleanup residue, and c) no more than 2.2
lbs. of other acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR §262, Subpart C & D.
Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF)—The management of working capital fund, or
industrial, commercial, and support-type activities by the Secretary of Defense through separate
accounting, reporting, and auditing. These activities include the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service (DFAS), DeCA and DRMS. Proceeds are routinely used to offset customer costs.
Diversion Rate—The total amount of non-hazardous SW, including construction and demolition
debris that is diverted from entering a disposal facility through composting, mulching, recycling,
reuse, and donation.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Waste Code—An EPA HW number listed in 40
CFR Part 261, Subpart C (characteristic waste) or Subpart D (listed waste).
Enterprise Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Management Information
System (EESOH-MIS)—This is the standardized Air Force HAZMAT and Hazardous Waste
tracking & reporting system.
Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS)—Compounds referred to in section III of the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA), which are found at 40 CFR
§355, Appendices A and B.
Final Governing Standards (FGS)—A comprehensive set of country-specific provisions,
typically technical limitations on effluent, discharges, etc., or a specific management practice
developed IAW DoDI 4715.05.
Fluorescent light ballast—A device that electronically controls fluorescent light fixtures and
that includes a capacitor containing 0.1 kg or less of dielectric fluid.
Generator—Under RCRA, any person, by site, whose act or process produces hazardous waste
identified or listed in Part 261, or whose act first causes a hazardous waste to become subject to
regulation (40 CFR §260.10). EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies typically
consider an Air Force installation as the generator in connection with hazardous waste produced
there. Therefore, in this AFI ―HW generator‖ refers to the installation commander or designated
representative of the installation.
AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  37


Generating Activity—Each organization (including Air Force and non-Air Force tenants), shop,
or work area using an operation or process that first generates a HW stream. The installation
HWMP must identify generating activities.
Hazard Communication Standard (HAZCOM)—An Occupational Safety and Health
Administration requirement, 29 CFR §1910.1200, that employers must develop, implement,
maintain and provide for their employees at each workplace which describes the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication program, labels and
other forms of warning, SDS and information and training.
Hazardous Constituent—Any component or chemical in a mixture, found in 40 CFR §261,
appendix VIII or 40 CFR §264, appendix IX or on the list of Extremely Hazardous Substances
(EHS).
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)—AFI 32-7086 defines the term HAZMAT as including all
items covered under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)
Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) (or other host nation, federal, state, or local) reporting
requirement, the OSHA HAZCOM Standard, all Class I and Class II Ozone Depleting
Substances (ODS), and materials which can reasonably be anticipated to generate a hazardous
waste (e.g., an expired shelf-life pharmaceutical item). The AFI 32-7086 definition does not
include munitions or Consumer Use Items exempted by the OSHA HAZCOM Standard.
Hazardous Waste (HW)—Any solid waste defined as a hazardous waste pursuant to 40 CFR
§261.3 or authorized state or host nation rules and regulations.
Hazardous Waste Accumulation Site (HWAS)—A location where a generator may
accumulate hazardous waste for a specific period of time without requiring a storage permit, or
without having interim status. The allowed accumulation time is dependent on the generator’s
classification and includes 90 days for large quantity generators, 180 days for small quantity
generators who transport their waste less than 200 miles for disposal, and 270 days for small
quantity generators who transport their waste 200 miles or more for disposal. See 40 CFR

Industrially Funded—A project funded by a type of governing revolving fund used to finance
operating costs of major service units, such as arsenals, depots, and shipyards that produce goods
and services as a business-type operation, where the receipts are credited directly to the fund and
are available, without further Congressional appropriation, to meet the needs of users. 10 U.S.C.§
2208
Initial Accumulation Point—A collection point located at, or near, the point of waste
generation where wastes are initially accumulated. The area must be under the control of the
operator of the process generating the waste. The operator should be near the area often enough
to detect a leak within a reasonable time frame. A maximum of 55 gallons of HW or one quart of
acute HW may be accumulated at an initial accumulation point. If more than this amount is
accumulated, the excess must be moved to a HWAS within three days of exceeding the limit.
Unless the quantity limit is exceeded, or state regulations require a limit on storage time (i.e.,
California), there are no storage time limits that apply to initial accumulation points. Initial
accumulation points are also known as satellite accumulation points (SAP). (40 CFR §262,
Subpart C)
Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM)—The ISWM approach is designed to minimize
the initial generation of the materials through source reduction, then through reusing and
recycling to further reduce the volume of materials being sent to landfills or incineration.
Liquid Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB)—A homogenous flowable material containing PCBs
and no more than 0.5 percent by weight non-dissolved material.
Listed Hazardous Waste—A specifically identified solid waste, material, or item listed in 40
CFR Part 261, Subpart D.
Manifest—HW shipping document required by federal or state regulatory agencies for
transportation of HW in order to track HW to a permitted or interim status TSDF; they are signed
by the installation commander or a named representative. (Refer to 40 CFR §262, Subpart B).
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)—A subset of solid waste that is defined as durable goods (e.g.,
appliances, tires, batteries), non-durable goods (e.g., newspapers, books, magazines), containers
and packaging, food wastes, yard trimmings, and miscellaneous organic wastes from residential,
commercial, and industrial non-process sources.
Non-liquid Polychlorinated Biphenyl (NLPCB)—Materials containing PCBs that by visual
inspection do not flow at room temperature (25° C or 77° F). Examples include demolition
debris and renovation wastes such as ceiling tiles, flooring, and dried paints.
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD)—A set of objective
criteria and management practices developed by the Department of Defense IAW DoDI 4715.05,
to protect human health and the environment.
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) article—Any manufactured article, other than a PCB
container, that contains PCBs and whose surface has been in contact with PCBs. PCB articles
include capacitors, transformers, electric motors, pumps, pipes, and any other manufactured item
that has functions dependent upon its design.

Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) bulk product waste—Waste derived from manufactured
products containing PCBs in a non-liquid state, at any concentration where the concentration at
the time of designation for disposal was 50 ppm or greater PCBs. PCB bulk product waste does
not include PCB liquids, PCB articles, PCB remediation waste, PCB containers, or PCB
household waste. PCB bulk product waste can include, but is not limited to: (1) Non-liquid bulk
wastes or debris from the demolition of buildings and other man-made structures manufactured
or coated with PCBs. PCB bulk product waste does not include debris from the demolition of
buildings or other man-made structures that is contaminated by spills from regulated PCBs that
have not been disposed or decontaminated IAW storage and disposal provisions. (2) PCB-
containing wastes from the shredding of automobiles, household appliances, or industrial
appliances. (3) Plastics (such as plastic insulation from wire or cable; radio, television and
computer casings; vehicle parts; or furniture laminates); preformed or molded rubber parts and
components; applied dried paints, varnishes, waxes or other similar coatings or sealants;
caulking; adhesives; paper; Galbestos; sound deadening or other types of insulation; and felt or
fabric products such as gaskets. (4)Fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs in the potting
material.
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) household waste—PCB waste that is: 1) generated by
residents on the premises of a temporary or permanent residence for individuals (including
individually owned or rented units of a multi-unit construction); and 2) that is composed
primarily of materials found in wastes generated by consumers in their homes. PCB household
waste includes unwanted or discarded non-commercial vehicles, household items, and appliances
generated on the premises of a residence for individuals as a result of routine household
maintenance by or on behalf of the resident. Bulk or commingled liquid PCB wastes at
concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, demolition and renovation wastes, and industrial or heavy-
duty equipment with PCBs are not household wastes. EPA has not clearly defined what
constitutes the difference between routine household maintenance wastes and renovation wastes.
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) remediation waste—Waste containing PCBs as a result of a
spill, release, or other unauthorized disposal, at the following concentrations: Materials disposed
before 18 April 1978, which are currently at concentrations 50 ppm or greater PCBs, regardless
of the concentration of the original spill. Materials currently at any volume or concentration
where the original source was 500 ppm or greater PCBs, beginning on 18 April 1978, or 50 ppm
or greater PCBs beginning on 2 July 1979. Materials currently at any concentration if the PCBs
are from a source not authorized for use.
Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) transformer—Any transformer that contains ≥ 500 ppm
PCBs. For PCB concentration assumptions applicable to transformers containing 1.36 kilograms
(3 lbs.) or more of fluid other than mineral oil, see 40 CFR §761.2. For provisions permitting
reclassification of electrical equipment, including PCB Transformers, containing ≥ 500 ppm
PCBs to PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment, see 40 CFR §761.30(a) and (h).
Putrescible Waste—Organic materials prone to degrade rapidly, giving rise to obnoxious odors.
Qualified Recycling Program (QRP)—A recycling program that manages proceeds pursuant to
10 U.S.C. §2577 and requires concerted efforts to divert or recover scrap or waste from waste
streams and identify, segregate, and maintain the integrity of the recyclable materials to maintain
or enhance the marketability of the materials. A QRP includes adherence to a control process
providing accountability for all materials processed through program operations.

Universal Waste—Certain types of common hazardous wastes for which the EPA or state
regulators have streamlined collection and management requirements to reduce the regulatory
burden on generators and facilitate environmentally sound collection and proper recycling or
treatment. At the Federal level universal wastes include batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing
lamps, and mercury-containing equipment. See universal waste requirements in 40 CFR §273.
Yard Trimmings—Grass clippings, leaves, brush, weeds, Christmas trees, and hedge and tree
prunings from residences and businesses. Yard trimmings may also include stumps and brush,
but these materials are not normally handled at composting facilities.

      WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS

A2.1. RCRA, 42 U. S.C., §§6901, et seq., as amended, sets minimum standards for managing
SW and HW at those DoD Installations within the US and US territories subject to the
jurisdiction of US federal law. The RCRA regulations governing SW and HW management
generally are found at Title 40 CFR Subchapter I (Part239, Part 240, Part 243, Part 246, Part 247,
Part 254-258, Part 260-268, Part 270-273, and Part 279).
A2.2. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, pursuant to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act, 29 U. S.C. §§651, et seq., sets federal health and safety standards for
employees who work with hazardous substances, training requirements for hazardous waste
clean-up operations at RCRA facilities, and emergency response operations, which is also known
as HAZWOPER training. The OSHA regulations in 29 §Part 1910.1200 describes employer
hazard communication requirements, commonly referred to as HAZCOM. Note: OSHA has
limited ability to regulate Air Force installations and activities. HAZCOM requirements for Air
Force installations and personnel are specified in AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication
(HAZCOM) Program.
A2.3. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 U. S.C. §§1801-1819,
requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate standards for the interstate and intrastate
commercial transportation of hazardous materials. These standards are found at 49 CFR Parts
171-180 and apply to transportation of hazardous materials and hazardous waste in the US and
US territories. HMTA does not apply to overseas installations, but there are strict controls on the
transnational shipment of hazardous materials and hazardous waste. Contact the DLA
Disposition Services and your MAJCOM JA for guidance about international shipping
requirements.
A2.4. TSCA, 15 U. S.C. §§2601, et seq., regulates the management and disposal of various
chemical substances and mixtures including LBP, PCBs, and asbestos. TSCA regulations are
found at 40 CFR Part 700-799, with the regulations governing the management of LBP, PCBs,
and asbestos found at §§745, 761, and 763 respectfully.
A2.5. CERCLA, 42 U. S.C. §§9601, et seq., and the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act (SARA), governs requirements for cleaning up contaminated sites.
CERCLA regulations are found at 40 CFR §300-374. At the time that SARA was passed,
Congress enacted the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) statute, 10 USC §§
2701, et seq. That statute created the Defense Environmental Restoration Account (the ―DERA
account), which is used to pay for DoD cleanups. Recently, each DoD agency was given its own
restoration account, so that the Air Force restoration account is known as the Air Force
Environmental Restoration Account (ERA).
A2.6. The Federal Facility Compliance Act, Public Law 102-386, which amended RCRA
Section 42 U.S.C. §§6961, generally waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity under
RCRA and allows state and federal regulatory agencies to fine federal facilities for violating
applicable federal, state, and local SW and HW laws.
A2.7. The following laws and regulations also impact SW and HW management: 10 U.S.C.
§§2577, Disposal of Recyclable Materials; 10 U.S.C. §§2692, Storage, Treatment, And Disposal
 42                                                         AFI32-7042 7 NOVEMBER 2014


Of Nondefense Toxic And Hazardous Materials; 32 CFR §172, Disposition of Proceeds from
DoD Sales of Surplus Personal Property; and 41 CFR §101-45, Sale, Abandonment or
Destruction of Personal Property and 101-46, Replacement of Personal Property Pursuant to the
Exchange/Sale Authority.
A2.8. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized states may adopt or enact
regulations as long as those regulations are at least as stringent as federal SW and HW
regulations. Most states have SW and HW regulations that are more stringent than federal
regulations. Air Force installations must follow authorized state or local SW and HW regulations
that are more stringent (but not broader in scope) than the federal regulations.
