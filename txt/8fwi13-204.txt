SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 8 FWI 13-204 by (1) changing procedures mandating Air Traffic
Control (ATC) pass Runway Surface Condition (RSC) information to inbound/outbound aircraft
communications when a “wet” runway is visually observed by the ATC tower, Supervisor of
Flying (SOF), or aircrew, and (2) changing the standard runway barrier configuration. A margin
bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

2.3. Runway Selection Procedures:
   2.3.1. The OG/CC has determined it is operationally advantageous to use Runway 36 as the
   primary runway when there is a tailwind component of 10 kts or less. When the 8 FW
   Supervisor of Flying (8 FW/SOF) is on duty, ATCT Watch Supervisor determines the active
   runway with input from the SOF. At other times, ATCT Watch Supervisor will select the
   active runway.
   2.3.2. ATCT shall coordinate with the 8 FW/SOF or 38 FG/SOF or Liaison (during periods
   of ROKAF flying) and RAPCON prior to initiating a runway change. Notify AMOPS, Fire,
   and Weather of the runway change.
   2.3.3. ATCT shall broadcast runway change on local and ground frequencies.          Include
   transmission on emergency frequencies during 8 FW/ROKAF flying.
   2.3.4. AMOPS shall notify 8th Fighter Wing, ROKAF, and Gunsan Airport Authority IAW
   established checklist.
8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012                                                                        11


   2.3.5. Barrier Maintenance shall notify AMOPS and ATCT prior to barrier reconfiguration
   and when configuration following runway change is complete. Runway operations are
   suspended during the barrier change process and shall resume only after AMOPS performs a
   post configuration runway inspection. AMOPS will advise ATCT when runway operations
   may be resumed.
Note: Barrier Maintenance shall use hand-held Land Mobile Radios when out of vehicle and
within 100’ of runway edge.
   2.3.6. Planning factors to consider:
       2.3.6.1. Complete aircraft arresting systems reconfiguration during runway changes takes
       approximately 30-45 minutes.

          & Approach) will add “RUNWAY APPEARS WET” to inbound/outbound aircraft
          communications until a determination is made and disseminated via established
          procedures. Control tower personnel will pass RSC change to AMOPs. Only
          AMOPS can change the RSC to “Dry”.
      2.16.2.2. Slush on Runway. A slush covered runway is reported as SLR//, indicating
      slush, but no ice or snow is present on the runway. When slush is the only surface
      condition, an RCR is not reported or reportable.
      2.16.2.3. Ice or Snow on Runway. Ice or snow on the runway is reported as
      IR/LSR/PSR. The predominant surface condition and associated condition reading will
      be reported.
   2.16.3. Reporting Runway Condition Reading (RCR):
      2.16.3.1. ATCT shall report the most current RSC and RCR information received from
      AMOPS prior to issuing taxi, takeoff or landing clearance. It is reported as a three-letter
      condition code and two-digit number from 01 (worst) to 26 (best). Use “RCRNR” when
      no RCR information is available. Tower will provide ICAO equivalent braking action
      (Good, Fair, Poor, Nil) to KAL and civilian aircraft.
      2.16.3.2. Minimum RCR for 8 FW F-16 take-offs, landings or taxi is 10. For all other
      aircraft, minimum RCR requirements are determined by aircraft technical order and
      owning command policy.
2.17. Procedures/Requirements for Conducting Runway Inspections/Checks:
   2.17.1. AMOPS performs daily airfield inspections IAW AFI 13-204V3, 9 January 2012.
   AMOPS shall notify the AFM and AOF/CC when a reported discrepancy is a hazard
   requiring immediate corrective action. Special attention will be given to the following areas:
      2.17.1.1. General airfield condition.
      2.17.1.2. General condition and operational status of aircraft arresting systems.

   form the Gogunsan-Gundo Island Group. The center of this island group is located at N
   35.50.000/E 126.24.000 (located approximately 12 miles southwest of the field).
   2.19.2. Aircraft should avoid over-flying the commercial terminal NE of Runway 36
   departure end, ROKAF housing area and Gunsan City.
2.20. Quiet Hours: Are IAW AFPD 11-2, 19 Jan 2012, Aircraft Rules and Procedures and
applies to all units assigned to 8 FW, as well as units assigned, attached, or supported by Kunsan
AB, ROK. There are two types of official quiet hours, full and partial.
Note 1: Korean Air Line and Eastar are exempt from all quiet hours.
Note 2: Recurring ROK wide quiet hours for school testing are published via AIRAD by 7AF.
   2.20.1. Full Quiet Hours: Takeoffs, landings, low approaches, touch and goes, stop and
   goes, engine runs, turbine powered Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) runs and taxiing
   anywhere on the airfield are prohibited. Full quiet hours are usually reserved for Change of
   Command (CoC) ceremonies of colonels and higher or approved wing events.
   2.20.2. Partial Quiet Hours: Same as para 2.20.1., with the exception that the following are
   permitted: full stop landings via straight-in approach, taxiing of aircraft, engine starts, and
   AGE runs.
   2.20.3. Approving authority for all quiet hours is the 8 OG/CC.
   2.20.4. Quiet Hour Scheduling: Quiet hours shall be requested through 8 OSS/OSO NLT
   two weeks prior to the event. 8 OSS/OSO will forward the request along with impact on
   projected 8 FW, ROKAF, and transient operations to the 8 OSS/DO for approval
   coordination. 8 OSS/OSO will notify the requestor of approval/denial, and will notify 8
   OSS/OSA to publish a NOTAM as needed.
   2.20.5. Unofficial Quiet Hours: Kunsan has an unofficial quiet hour agreement with the city
   of Gunsan for the hours of 2300 to 0600. AMOPS shall notify Public Affairs of any non-base
   assigned aircraft requesting a departure or arrival during these hours. Public Affairs will pass
   the information to the Gunsan Mayor’s Office as necessary.
2.21. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas/Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ):
   2.21.1. Primary Protection. ATCT shall protect ILS critical areas/POFZ using the perimeter
   road traffic lights IAW JO 7110.65 and AFI 13-204.
   2.21.2. Once critical area/POFZ lights are activated, ATCT will inform AMOPS that critical
   area procedures are in effect. AMOPS will then expeditiously conduct a physical sweep of
   the north critical area along perimeter road to ensure no vehicles or pedestrians are operating
   within the traffic lights. Once AMOPS reports the area clear then ATCT will consider the
   area protected.
Note: See attachment 17 for POFZ depiction.
8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012                                                                          21


   2.21.3. If the traffic control lights fail, ATCT will protect the critical area IAW para
   2.21.3.1. until a suitable critical area protection system is in place.
       2.21.3.1. Alternate Protection. Physical protection of the ILS critical areas is required
       when the PAR is out of service and the weather is reported or forecasted less than an 800’
       ceilings and/or less than 2 miles visibility. Protection of the ILS/touchdown critical areas
       ensures uninterrupted navigational signals to recovering aircraft. ATCT is the single
       point of contact for approval of vehicles to transit the critical areas once the areas are
       secure (see Attachment 18).
           2.21.3.1.1. Implementation:
           2.21.3.1.2. ATCT ensures further protection of the critical areas when the weather is
           reported or forecasted below 200' ceiling and/or less than 1/2 mile visibility IAW JO
           7110.65, 9 February 2012.
           2.21.3.1.2.1. Responsibilities:
               2.21.3.1.2.1.1. ATCT shall:
                   2.21.3.1.2.1.1.1. Inform AOF/CC, SFS and AMOPS of the runway in use and
                   time check with initial notification of activation of this procedure.
                   Notification shall be made using direct landline to AMOPS and SFS.
                   2.21.3.1.2.1.2. Direct SFS and AMOPS to implement the critical area
                   protection plan. See Attachment 18.
                   2.21.3.1.2.1.3. Advise the 8FW/SOF, RAPCON, AOF/CC and Tower Chief
                   Controller once SFS and AMOPS notification is made and when the areas to
                   be protected are secure. If weather is reported below 800’ ceilings and/or
                   3200M visibility or ATCT visibility is lower than 3200M (and different than
                   official weather sequence) and the critical areas are not secured IAW this
                   procedure, arriving aircraft will be instructed to hold until such time as the
                   areas are protected, aircraft reaches divert fuel/SOF directs divert or the
                   aircraft reaches emergency fuel/pilot declares emergency and desires to land
                   with the areas not properly protected. If an emergency is declared and the
                   pilot desires to land at Kunsan AB airfield, ATCT will inform the pilot that
                   the ILS is not protected/monitored and clear aircraft to land. Phraseology:
                   Runway 36/18 ILS Critical Area Not Protected, Landing Will Be At Own Risk.
                   2.21.3.1.2.1.4. If weather is reported below 200’ ceilings and/or 800M
                   visibility, ATCT will further protect the critical area by holding all aircraft at
                   the instrument hold lines. ATCT will notify EOR crews to move personnel
                   and vehicles behind the EOR shacks.
Note: As long as the current official weather observation is above minimums, ATC will not
delay arrivals for lack of critical area protection. This applies when forecast weather is below
minimums, but observed weather is still above minimums. The lowest visibility (official
weather or ATCT) will be used for aircraft operations and ILS critical Area Protection.
                   2.21.3.1.2.1.5. Notify 8 SFS, AMOPS, RAPCON, 8FW/SOF, AOF/CC as
                   soon as protection of the critical areas is no longer required.
 22                                                                8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012

                  runway in use as outlined in Attachment 18.
                  2.21.3.1.2.2.2. Notify dispatch (Wolf Pack) once in place. Units are required
                  to be in place within 15 minutes. Dispatch will advise ATCT the areas are
                  protected. Units must remain in place until notified by ATCT through
                  dispatch. If unable to respond within 15 minutes, notify ATCT via direct
                  landline or 782-5800 immediately with estimated time to specified locations.
                  2.21.3.1.2.2.3. Notify ATCT via the direct line, 782-5800 or FM net once
                  critical areas are physically protected (SFS personnel in place and controlling
                  all vehicular traffic).
                  2.21.3.1.2.2.4. 8 SFS must monitor the FM net continuously while on airfield.

                  2.21.3.1.2.3.2. Check critical movement areas. Notify ATCT, via Tower Net
                  or 782-5800, when critical areas on the movement area are protected.
2.22. Restricted Areas on the Airfield: See Attachment 17. Restricted area access is granted
via designated Entry Control Points (ECPs).
2.23. Opening/Closing/Suspending Runway Operations.
   2.23.1. Procedures for opening and closing the runway will be accomplished IAW AFI 13-
   204V3, Chapter 21.
   2.23.2. ATCT, FW/SE, 8 OG/CC, 8 FW/SOF, or AMOPS will suspend runway operations
   when there is reason to believe a hazard exists on/near the runway or in the immediate
   approach area. Only AMOPS personnel are authorized to open/close/resume runway
   operations.
   2.23.3. Runway ops are automatically suspended following arresting system engagements
   and when an aircraft shuts down on the runway.
   2.23.4. For permanent runway closure and re-activation, refer to AFI 13-204V3, 9 January
   2012, para 3.6.
2.24. Ground Support Equipment.
   2.24.1. Mobile ground support equipment may be located on aprons, but must be positioned
   to provide minimum wingtip clearance distances for all aircraft other than those being
   serviced with the equipment.

                                            Chapter 4

                                     VFR PROCEDURES

4.1. VFR Weather Minimums:
   4.1.1. SFO Pattern: 1000 ft ceiling above the highest requested SFO altitude flown and
   8000M visibility.
Note: SFO altitudes: High Key 7,000’ – 10,000, Low Key 3,000 – 5,000, Base Key minimum
2,000’
   4.1.2. Overhead Pattern/VFR Pattern Breakout Weather Minimums: 2,500 ft ceiling/4800M
   visibility.
   4.1.3. Fighter Rectangular Pattern Weather Minimums: 2,000ft ceiling/4800M visibility.
   4.1.4. Conventional Aircraft Rectangular Pattern Weather Minimums:                    1,500 ft
   ceiling/4800M visibility.
   4.1.5. Helicopter Pattern Weather Minimums: 1,000 ft ceiling/4800M visibility.
4.2. Preferred Recovery: The overhead pattern via the VFR entry points is the preferred
recovery. Pilots recovering to Kunsan on an IFR flight plan must cancel IFR prior to the VFR
entry points of “Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, or Delta”. If unable to cancel IFR prior to these points,
aircraft should recover IFR via an IFR approach procedure.
4.3. VFR Recoveries: RAPCON provides basic radar advisory services for VFR recoveries.
Aircraft shall contact RAPCON no later than 30 miles from the field with current ATIS and
request type approach and landing. Pattern entry via Kunsan’s VFR recovery points (See
Attachment 4) is standard unless weather or traffic conditions require otherwise. Weather
minimums at VFR reporting points are 3,000 ft ceiling/4800M visibility for aircraft recoveries
via the overhead and 2,000 ft ceiling/4800M visibility for aircraft recoveries via VFR straight-in.
4.4. VFR Departures: Aircraft may depart VFR with an approved flight plan. Aircraft shall
make VFR departure requests on initial contact with ground control. Aircraft shall maintain at or
below 1,000 ft until departure end of runway then climb to requested altitude. Once clear of the
Class C aircraft will advise RAPCON when changing frequencies.
4.5. VFR Traffic Patterns:
   4.5.1. Opening and Closing Tower VFR Traffic Patterns: ATCT Watch Supervisor will
   coordinate with the SOF during periods of 8 FW flying when opening or closing the Tower’s
   VFR patterns. ATCT Watch Supervisor has the final authority for opening or closing the
   VFR patterns. The 8 FW SOF may restrict 8 FW aircraft from using VFR patterns at
   anytime.
   4.5.2. Overhead Pattern: Pattern altitude is 1,500 ft, flown west of the airfield. Unless
   otherwise instructed by ATCT, standard break is over the approach end of runway. Flight
   lead reports “five-mile initial” (See Attachment 7).
Note: If requesting the straight-in, pilots shall state “Request VFR straight-in” vs. “Visual
straight-in” to avoid confusion with the request for a “Visual Approach” (IFR approach).

   4.5.3. Protection of the Overhead: All aircraft departures, including aircraft conducting low
   approach, touch and go or missed approach, must remain at or below 1000 ft until past
   departure end to protect aircraft recovering via the overhead pattern.
   4.5.4. Re-Entry Pattern: Aircraft carrying straight through initial shall maintain 1,500 ft and
   turn east to crosswind 1/2 mile past departure end of runway. Aircraft re-entering after a low
   approach or takeoff shall maintain at or below 1,000 ft MSL until ½ NM past the departure
   end of runway then turn to an east crosswind and climb to 2,000 ft MSL (see Attachment 5).
      4.5.4.1. After entering crosswind, aircraft fly to North/South Point (dependent on runway
      in use). All aircraft re-entering after a low approach must fly a 2 mile crosswind prior to
      turning to North/South Point to de-conflict with aircraft offsetting to the east during SFO
      approaches or recovering via tactical initial (See Attachment 5).
      4.5.4.2. Prior to reaching North/South Point, aircraft state intentions (initial or straight-
      in).
      4.5.4.3. If approved for straight-in, aircraft descend to 1,000 ft and proceed to final.
      4.5.4.4. If approved for initial, aircraft maintain 1,500 ft and proceed from North/South
      Point to initial.
   4.5.5. VFR Pattern Breakout: Aircraft will climb to 2,000 ft and turn SW bound (for Runway
   36) or NW bound (for Runway 18). ATCT will issue further instructions.
   4.5.6. Rectangular Pattern: Conventional aircraft pattern altitude is 1,000 ft and flown west
   of the airfield. Fighter/turbojet aircraft pattern altitude is 1,500 ft and flown west of the
   airfield.
   4.5.7. Helicopter Patterns: Pattern altitude is 500 ft MSL.
      4.5.7.1. Transient helicopters normally arrive over the Okku Reservoir, East of Kunsan
      and make a straight-in approach via Taxiway C to land on runway at Taxiway C.
      Helicopters shall not overfly the MSA below 1,500 ft.
      4.5.7.2. Kunsan AB has no helipads or specially sited areas for helicopter operations
      therefore any operations requested to areas other than the runway in use shall be in
      accordance with      JO 7110.65, 9 February 2012.
      4.5.7.3. FARP Pattern: The preferred pattern for helicopters transitioning between the
      designated parking area on Taxiway H to the Hot Cargo Pad during FARP operations is
      to circle the field southeast of the MSA. Helicopters shall not cross the runway or
      extended runway centerline without ATCT approval. Helicopters may air taxi to
      Taxiway H via Taxiway C.
4.6. Special Procedures:
   4.6.1. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Pattern/Procedures: Kunsan AB supports U-2 and F-16
   SFOs. For specifics on SFO Patterns/Procedures; see current SFO LOA(s) (See Attachment
   7)
   4.6.2. Tactical Recovery Procedure (TRP):
      4.6.2.1. Authorized IAW Attachment 6.
28                                                               8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012


      4.6.2.2. Weather Minimums: IAW AFI 11-2F16V3 CH 8/8 FW Sup1, 10 May 2012,
      ceiling must be at least 1000’ above TRP altitude with 8000M visibility.
      4.6.2.3. Flight leads advise Kunsan Approach during initial contact of the number of
      aircraft in the flight and the altitude entering the TRP recovery. Maximum four aircraft
      allowed on the recovery. Flights maintain standard formation until coordination with
      ATC for a non-standard trail formation.
      4.6.2.4. TRP and SFO patterns are not accomplished simultaneously.
          4.6.2.4.1. Pilots will plan to fly the TRP to the active runway, e.g. approach from the
          south for RWY 36 TRP. RAPCON will sequence to the TRP starting point regardless
          of which direction the flight is recovering.
      4.6.2.5. TRP Pattern (Attachment 6):
          4.6.2.5.1. Wingmen shall fly 6,000 ft line abreast on the east side and trailing
          element shall fly 2 NM trail. Flight leads shall line up with the reservoir east of the
          airfield regardless of northern or southern approach.
          4.6.2.5.2. Commence the TRP at 400 KCAS between 11,000 and 12,000 ft, parallel
          with the runway, and abeam the approach end of Runway 36 when arriving from the
          North, and abeam "South Point" when arriving from the South."
          4.6.2.5.3. Execute a 10º idle descent (no more than 15°).
          4.6.2.5.4. Just north of South Point, execute an in-place 90° turn to the west to
          remain over the water.
          4.6.2.5.5. Make in-place 90° turns to arrive at tactical initial between 2,500 ft and
          3,500 ft. Aircraft will maintain 300-350 KIAS.
          4.6.2.5.6. Execute break to the west then turn north or south to arrive on downwind
          with the appropriate airspeed and references for a normal perch point for the landing
          runway. Do not descend below 2,500 ft MSL until west of the runway 36/18
          centerline.
  4.6.3. Tactical Initial:
      4.6.3.1. Weather minimums: 2,500 ft ceiling and 4800M visibility.
      4.6.3.2. Pattern: Flight leads advise RAPCON during initial contact of their intentions to
      fly tactical initial. Flight/element leads shall align their initial ground track with the
      extended runway centerline. Wingmen shall fly line abreast 4,000 ft to the east.
      Elements in-trail shall maintain 1-1.5NM spacing on preceding element. Flight lead shall
      fly depicted ground track (See Attachment 6) and report “five-mile Tac Initial” when
      established on runway heading and five miles from EOR. Aircraft should use 6 DME
      (Runway 36) and 5 DME (Runway 18) when reporting “five-mile Tac Initial”, cross the
      VFR entry point at and maintain 2,500 ft until five-mile initial, then descend to 1,500 ft.
      Aircraft shall maintain 300 KCAS from the VFR entry point to the break point (aircraft
      will not exceed 400 KIAS). Aircraft shall break over approach EOR unless ATCT
      directs otherwise. Maximum number of aircraft per element shall not exceed two, four
      for the flight.
8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012                                                                      29


      4.6.3.3. Elements flying straight through initial shall terminate tactical maneuvering after
      the turn to crosswind and de-conflict from trailing elements on the turn to crosswind.
   4.6.4. Combat Departures:
      4.6.4.1. Weather minimums: 11,000 ft ceiling and 4800M visibility. SOF approves
      deviations.
      4.6.4.2. Pattern: Combat departures are composite flight plans (VFR/IFR). VFR flight
      is conducted for the first portion of the flight and IFR automatically commences at ATC
      assigned altitude. Pilots shall maintain ATC assigned altitude and advise departure
      control of intentions. Pilots requesting to cancel IFR service shall advise RAPCON they
      are “cancelling IFR” and proceeding VFR (See Attachment 10).
      4.6.4.3. Pilots requesting combat departures will coordinate with Ground Control prior to
      taxi.
4.7. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures:
   4.7.1. IAW AFI 13-204, 9 January 2012 MAJCOM A3 are responsible for establishing
   Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) criteria for their specific commands. The
   following RSRS standards (i.e., less than JO 7110.65, 9 February 2012, standard separation)
   apply to all PACAF assigned aircraft at PACAF bases where ATC is provided by USAF
   controllers (includes aircraft deployed to Kunsan and identified as temporary 8 FW assets).
   Non-PACAF aircraft may participate in RSRS if covered under a letter of agreement (i.e.,
   Joint Letter of Agreement on RSRS at PACAF bases).
   4.7.2. Air traffic controllers must see the aircraft involved and determine distances by
   reference to suitable landmarks (i.e., distance markers, taxiways) for daytime and nighttime.
   4.7.3. Revert to nighttime RSRS standards when the RCR is reported between 16 and 12
   inclusive, or when RCR is not available and RSC is reported as ice or snow.
   4.7.4. For fighter-type aircraft only, a low approach following a full stop shall use the
   opposite side of the runway and be 500 ft vertically separated when passing the aircraft on
   landing roll. Aircraft shall not overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation
   rests with the pilot. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to all aircraft
   involved.
   4.7.5. Same fighter-type aircraft operations mean the same airframe (e.g., A-10 behind A-10,
   F-16 behind F-16).
   4.7.6. Dissimilar fighter-type aircraft operations mean not the same airframe (e.g., F-16
   behind F-15, F-16 behind A-10).
   4.7.7. Non-heavy, non-fighter-type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
   4.7.8. RSRS between formation full stops (holding hands) are authorized provided all
   aircraft involved are the same type aircraft. Separation is measured between the trailing
   aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the trailing formation.

                                            Chapter 5

                                       IFR PROCEDURES

5.1. Radar Traffic Patterns:
   5.1.1. The normal radar pattern altitude is 4,000 ft, flown to the east of the airfield. Aircraft
   may be vectored on a dogleg at 3,000 ft (Runway 36) or 2,500 ft (Runway 18) if within 13
   miles of the airfield.
   5.1.2. Circling Maneuvers: Pilots shall circle west of the field. RAPCON shall provide
   appropriate IFR spacing when an aircraft is authorized a circling approach.
5.2. Availability/Restrictions for Surveillance (ASR) Approaches and Precision Approach
Radar (PAR) Approaches/Monitoring:
   5.2.1. ROKAF 38 FG shall provide dual PAR capability from 0700L- 2300L, Mon-Fri.
   PAR capability unavailable Mon-Fri, 2300L-0700L and Sat-Sun unless coordinated prior
   with 8 OSS/OSAR (782-4939).
   5.2.2. When available (see 5.2.1), Radar Final Control (RFC) will monitor aircraft
   conducting an ILS approach when weather conditions are below 1,500 ft ceiling or less than
   8000M visibility, at night or upon pilot request.
   5.2.3. Kunsan AB does not have any published surveillance (ASR) approaches.
5.3. Local Departure Procedures:
   5.3.1. Pack Flight Plans: see Chapter 9, Flight Planning Procedures.
   5.3.2. Transitions (See Attachment 8): The following transitions are clearances that connect
   to Pack Flight Plans: LINTA , CONAN , ENTEL, NAMPO , OKISA and the SEMI
   Transitions. Pilots filing Pack Flight Plans shall automatically be cleared for the transition
   corresponding to the first point of the flight plan.
   5.3.3. On departure, aircraft shall maintain at or below 1,000 ft until departure end of the
   runway then climb to clearance altitude. Upon passing 3 DME, aircraft shall start a turn in
   the shortest direction to the first transition point on the Pack Flight Plans. Radar is required.
   5.3.4. To ensure separation, the last aircraft of in-trail departures will squawk “subset and
   altitude” (Mode 3/A of XX00, where XX is the first two-digits of the flight lead’s assigned
   Mode 3/A transponder code).
   5.3.5. Non-radar routing is also available.
5.4. Radar Vectors to Initial: Approach control may vector aircraft to VFR Entry Points (See
Attachment 4) or 10 mile initial for sequencing with IFR/VFR traffic. Pilots recovering to
Kunsan on an IFR flight plan must cancel IFR prior to the VFR entry points of “Alpha, Bravo,
Charlie, or Delta” or 10 mile initial. If unable to cancel IFR prior to these points, aircraft should
recover IFR via an IFR approach procedure. Aircraft shall cross the VFR Entry Point at or above
2,500 ft while proceeding direct to a five-mile initial, then descend to 1,500 ft. Maintain 300
KCAS from the VFR Entry Point to the break point.
 32                                                                   8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012


5.5. IFR Recovery Procedures:
   5.5.1. Aircraft shall contact RAPCON no later than 30 miles from the field with current
   ATIS, requested approach, type landing and number of aircraft in flight.
   5.5.2. Radar In-Trail Recoveries: Pilot initiated only. Upon initial contact, flight lead shall
   inform RAPCON of number of aircraft in flight and request “radar trail recovery.” See “8
   OG/51 OG Radar In-Trail Recovery Letter of Agreement”.
       5.5.2.1. Flights shall maintain standard formation until coordination with ATC for a non-
       standard trail recovery formation.
       5.5.2.2. To ensure separation, the last aircraft of in-trail recoveries will squawk “subset
       and altitude” (Mode 3/A of XX00, where XX is the first two-digits of the flight lead’s
       assigned Mode 3/A transponder code and altitude).
       5.5.2.3. Radar trail recoveries to simultaneous PAR approaches are not authorized.
       5.5.2.4. All aircraft shall fly the same type of final approach (TACAN, ILS, or VFR
       straight-in) and report the Final Approach Fix (FAF). Recoveries shall normally
       terminate in a full stop landing.
Note: When remaining on RAPCON’s frequency until landing, RAPCON shall only broadcast
the landing clearance to the lead aircraft. Clearance to the lead aircraft is clearance for the entire
flight to land. RAPCON shall, however, acknowledge all “FAF, gear down” calls.
       5.5.2.5. Abnormal procedures: Trail aircraft losing radar contact on preceding aircraft
       prior to intercepting a segment of the approach shall inform lead, climb 500 ft above last
       assigned altitude, and obtain a separate clearance from ATC. Subsequent trailing aircraft
       may, if able, continue the trail recovery. If radar contact is lost after established on a
       segment of the approach, the approach may be continued if separation can be confirmed
       by NAVAIDs. In the event of a breakout/go-around, each element shall comply with
       specific ATC instructions.
5.6. Non-Radar Procedures: In the event Kunsan RAPCON surveillance radar is out of
service, the following procedures shall be in effect:
   5.6.1. Weather permitting and upon 8 OG/CC approval, 8 FW aircraft should depart/arrive
   VFR to the maximum extent possible to avoid long delays.
   5.6.2. Departures: ATC shall issue aircraft (on IFR flight plans) altitudes that ensure non-
   radar separation and advise Osan Approach Control or Incheon ARTCC of assigned
   altitudes. ATC shall inform aircraft filed for MOA 2, MOA 3, MOA 15, MOA 15A, MOA
   19 Low, R-97A, R-97B, R97C or R-111 of airspace limitations due to radar outage.
       5.6.2.1. Departure control shall request from aircraft their ETA over ENTEL (KUZ
       035/34) or LINTA (KUZ 159/26). Departure control shall coordinate this time with Osan
       Approach Control or Incheon ARTCC and transfer communications no later than ENTEL
       or LINTA. Aircraft can expect direct routing unless traffic conditions warrant otherwise.
   5.6.3. Arrivals: Arrivals shall enter Kunsan’s airspace below FL 180 via NAMPO, ENTEL,
   OKISA, or LINTA. RAPCON shall issue routings and altitudes that ensure non-radar
   separation and direct aircraft to the VFR traffic pattern, the published segment of the
8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012                                                                 33


   TACAN/VOR/ILS approach or to WOLFF (KUZ R-090/20) for holding. Approaches shall
   full stop or remain in the VFR traffic pattern.
Note: MOA 19 Low must be cold to clear aircraft on any published approach to Runway 36.
   5.6.4. Special Use Airspace: Approach control shall coordinate with the BWDO and Cobra/
   ROKAF MCRC (Acacia) on an “as needed” basis for acquisition/restriction of the following
   special use airspace (IAW ACCR 55-9, paragraph 1.8.): Runway 36 in use; MOA 2, MOA
   3, MOA 15, MOA 15A and MOA 19; Runway 18 in use; MOA 2, MOA 3, MOA 15, MOA
   15A, R-111 and R-97A/B/C/D. (See Attachment 13).

   information over PCAS/SCN when applicable:
       6.2.2.1. Disaster grid map coordinates. If unable to determine grid coordinates, use
       commonly known geographical references.
Note: AMOPS shall be required to maintain a current grid map, and train all personnel on its use
for coordination of emergency efforts.
   6.2.3. In Flight Emergencies (IFE):
       6.2.3.1. Single Frequency Approach (SFA): Available from RAPCON on CH 12 (UHF
       268.025). This frequency is utilized at pilot discretion for IFEs requiring simultaneous
       pilot, SOF, ATC and emergency response coordination. Only ATC agencies may
       transmit control instructions. RAPCON will continuously monitor CH 12 and notify
       ATCT and 8 FW/38 FG SOF of imminent IFEs. RAPCON will notify ATCT and 8 FW
       SOF and 38 FG SOF when CH 12 is being used for emergency aircraft operations.
       6.2.3.2. ATCT shall broadcast, as soon as possible, on all appropriate frequencies (to
       include emergency frequencies during 8 FW/ROKAF flying), if an IFE affects runway
       ops. Example: “Attention all aircraft, Kunsan Tower on Guard, IFE in progress, ETA
       (time). Expect (length of delay, if known) runway ops suspension.”
       6.2.3.3. ATCT shall suspend airborne/ground ops that may interfere with an inbound
       emergency aircraft or responding ground crews once the emergency aircraft reaches five-
       mile final.
       6.2.3.4. After aircraft exits runway, it should taxi to the closest EOR spot to the
       runway/appropriate area (e.g., hot brakes, hydrazine, etc.). Once parked, aircraft should
       contact the senior fire official, callsign “COMMAND” on CH 12. COMMAND is in
       charge of all fire response vehicles.
Note 1: Following an SFA, ATCT shall release CH 12 to COMMAND once aircraft stops
taxiing.

Note 2: If aircraft is unable to exit runway, ATCT shall authorize COMMAND onto runway.
When authorized on runway, COMMAND becomes responsible for all other fire response
vehicles on runway and is responsible to report all vehicles off runway. Any agency besides
COMMAND needing access will contact ATCT directly.
       6.2.3.5. ATCT shall monitor CH 12 while COMMAND has control. ATCT shall return
       CH 12 to RAPCON upon IFE termination. If able the SOF shall monitor CH 12.

       shall notify all other agencies via the SCN.
       6.2.3.7. AMOPS shall conduct a runway check following all IFEs. The 8 FW/SOF may
       waive runway FOD checks following 8 FW aircraft IFEs, for emergencies unlikely to
       involve fluid, parts, or debris shedding. When no 8 FW/SOF is on duty, and 8 FW flying
       is not in progress, AMOPS may waive runway FOD checks following all other IFEs
       unlikely to involve fluid, parts, or debris shredding.
   6.2.4. Ground Emergencies:
       6.2.4.1. If an aircraft declares a ground emergency, ATCT shall obtain CH 12 from
       RAPCON, if available, and direct the aircraft to contact COMMAND on CH 12. If CH
       12 is already in use, ATC and SOF shall coordinate to assign another discrete frequency.
Note: If aircraft is unable to exit runway, ATCT shall authorize COMMAND onto runway.
COMMAND is in charge of all fire response vehicles. When authorized on runway,
COMMAND becomes responsible for all other fire response vehicles on runway and is
responsible to report all vehicles off runway. Any agency besides COMMAND needing access
will contact ATCT directly.
       6.2.4.2. PCAS/SCN notification/emergency termination is same as IFE (See para 6.2.3.).

   6.3.3. MOCC must notify 8 FW/SOF, AMOPS and ATCT of Quickfreeze.
   6.3.4. If notification of the Quickfreeze originates through an agency other than the 8 MXG,
   SOF/ATCT must immediately notify AMOPS and MOCC to alert AMU and EOR of the
   Quickfreeze.
   6.3.5. AMOPS will conduct an inspection of the CMA, or closest suspect routing point to the
   CMA, and inspect toward the origination point. AMOPS will perform sweeper control
   during Quickfreezes based on identified need/observed debris. AMOPS shall coordinate
   with ATCT for all CMA sweeps, and report pavement areas identified debris free and/or
   operations safe.
   6.3.6. Maintenance immediately starts search upon initiating Quickfreeze in non-CMAs,
   emphasizing taxiway centerlines. Use all assets available to conduct the search.
   6.3.7. The maintenance unit initiating the Quickfreeze will notify MOCC when sweep is
   complete. MOCC notifies SOF, ATCT and AMOPS.

                           AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEMS

7.1. Aircraft Arresting System/Barrier Configuration: (See Attachment 2).
   7.1.1. Bi-directional BAK-12 arresting cables are located approximately 2,525 ft from each
   approach end of Rwy 18 and 2,507ft from the approach end of Rwy 36. The departure end
   BAK-12 shall be connected and operational; the approach end cable shall be disconnected
   and placed alongside the runway.
   7.1.2. Bi-directional BAK-14 arresting cables are located approximately 1,410 ft from each
   approach of Rwy 18 and 1,406 ft from the approach end of Rwy 36. The BAK-14 is
   remotely raised or lowered by control tower personnel. To sustain the serviceability of the
   BAK-14 system during normal operations, the cable system will remain in the
   down/retracted position IAW AFI 32-1043 with the following exceptions.
      7.1.2.1. 8 FW/38 FG departure(s) or departure phase – Raised position, “UP, UP, UP”
      (BAK-12 raised, BAK-14 raised, and E-5 raised).
          7.1.2.1.1. Should an arrival occur during departure phase, lower the BAK-14 for an
          “UP, DOWN, UP” configuration. Return BAK-14 to raised position, once arrival has
          exited the runway.
      7.1.2.2. 8 FW/38 FG arrival phase – Lowered position “UP, DOWN, UP” (BAK-12
      raised, BAK-14 lowered, and E-5 raised).
      7.1.2.3. 8 FW/38 FG arrival(s) or arrival phase with wet/reduced RCR/braking action
      runway – Raised position (up, up, up)
      7.1.2.4. All other aircraft operations – Lower position (up, down, up)
      7.1.2.5. ATCT shall raise the departure end BAK-14 cable when 8 FW/SOF directed or
      pilot requested.
      7.1.2.6. Should ATCT lose power at the remote control cable panel (or if power is lost at
      BAK-14 sites), both BAK-14s will rise automatically. Barrier Maintenance has override
      capability.
      7.1.2.7. ATCT shall lower the raised BAK-14 for all commercial and civil aviation
      aircraft regardless of size and all military arrivals C-130 or larger or when pilot
      requested.”
      7.1.2.8. During periods of reduced RCR/braking action the 8 FW/SOF may consider, on
      a case-by-case basis, temporary alternate barrier configurations for emergencies and to
      meet operational requirements (i.e. single departure end cable, landings over raised
      approach end E-5, BAK-12 without 8-point tie down).
   7.1.3. A unidirectional E-5 arresting cable is located 49 ft into runway 18 overrun and 38 ft
   into runway 36 overrun. The departure end E-5 shall be connected and operational; the
   approach end cable shall be disconnected and placed alongside the overrun.
 44                                                              8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012


   7.1.4. Deviations to the standard cable configuration must be approved by the 8 FW/SOF,
   reported to AMOPS, and may be published as a NOTAM if the non-standard configuration
   meets AFI 11-208 NOTAM criteria.
   7.1.5. Taxiway C BAK-12: Bi-directional BAK-12 arresting cable is located approximately
   3,369 ft from the west end of Taxiway C; 4,746ft from the east end of Taxiway C.
7.2. Maintenance:
   7.2.1. 8 CES Barrier Maintenance shall inspect the airfield arresting systems at the start of
   each day and report operability to via radio to ATCT and AMOPS before departing the
   airfield.

   in 8 FWI 15-101, Weather Support Procedures.
   10.18.2. AMOPS personnel are responsible for disseminating hazardous/severe weather and
   lightning information via the secondary crash net.
   10.18.3. Lightning Procedures.
       10.18.3.1. Lightning Watch. Informative only and will be issued when lightning is
       forecast to be within 5 NM radius of the airfield in the next 30 minutes.
       10.18.3.2. Lightning Warning. Issued when lightning is observed within a 5 NM radius.
       When a Lightning Warning is issued the following will be accomplished.
           10.18.3.2.1. Cease refueling and all airfield activity. Evacuate personnel from the
           airfield to indoor cover or within an airfield vehicle as a minimum.
           10.18.3.2.2. Aircraft will not be armed or de-armed during lightning within 5 NM of
           the airfield area. In the chocks, clear the crew chief off and remain running or
           shutdown and clear the airfield. The intent is to expeditiously get the crew chief off
           the airfield and to safety. If taxiing, contact SOF and expect guidance to either
           continue taxiing or to return to EOR (primary) or parking (secondary).
       10.18.3.3. Aircraft will not takeoff, land or fly approaches at Kunsan AB during periods
       of lightning within 5 NM of the airfield. If airborne, aircraft will hold until approaching
       divert fuel, then divert. If dire circumstances require an aircraft to land during lightning
       periods, the OG/CC is the approval authority. This guidance does not preclude the SOF
       from making time-sensitive safety-of-flight decisions based on his SA and ORM
       assessment.
10.19. Airfield Snow Removal Operations: 8 OSS/DO and 8 OSS/OSA/OSAM are members
of the Snow and Ice Control Committee (S&ICC). Specific snow removal/coordination
procedures are identified in Kunsan AB Snow and Ice Control Plan. As per the Snow and Ice
Control Plan, CES will be required to coordinate all snow removal operations on the airfield with
AMOPS and ATC prior to conducting operations, whether they are manual or chemical removal.
10.20. Local Bird/Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program Guidelines: Specific procedures
and program guidelines are identified in 8 FWOPLAN 91-202, BASH.

   operations in blacked-out airfield conditions.
      10.43.1.1. Scheduling:     Requesting units must contact AMOPS or designated
      representative two weeks in advance to coordinate NVD operations. Advise AMOPS of
      any obstructions, obstacles or hazards to be placed on the airfield that may affect the
      airfield environment. This will allow AMOPS time to issue pertinent NOTAMS. All
      proposed NVD mission times are coordinated in advance with 8 FW Scheduling. This
8 FWI 13-204 13 JUNE 2012                                                                      65


      will help de-conflict operations, eliminate confusion and reduce delays to NVD mission
      aircraft.
      10.43.1.2. NVD Weather Requirements: All NVD operations shall be conducted in
      VMC. The pattern weather requirements are 1,500 ft ceiling and 3 miles visibility.
      Moon illumination requirement is 2.2 millilux or higher.
      10.43.1.3. NVD Taxi Routes and Traffic Pattern Procedures: Aircraft Commander must
      comply with exterior lighting requirements at all times. Anti-collision lights may be
      turned off, safety permitting.
         10.43.1.3.1. There are no restrictions to NVD taxi routes except those listed in
         Chapter 2 but taxiway lights must be operated IAW JO 7110.65 prior to a non-
         participating aircraft beginning taxi.
         10.43.1.3.2. The VFR traffic pattern is right traffic for Runway 18, left traffic for
         Runway 36. Pattern altitude for both runways is 1000 feet MSL. ATCT will limit the
         number of aircraft in the VFR pattern to three. Tower controllers are not authorized
         to use NVDs while controlling aircraft. During blackout operations, ATCTs ability to
         visually track aircraft and scan the runway and surface area is significantly degraded.
         Class C service will not be provide, ATCT service is limited to traffic advisories only.
         10.43.1.3.3. Participating aircraft must utilize navigation lights.
      10.43.1.4. Vehicle Operations: Vehicle operations on the CMA should be kept to a
      minimum during NVD operations. This is to prevent aircraft mission delays and reduce
      the possibility of runway incursions during reduced airfield lighting configurations. Any
      operational requests not listed in this operating instruction will be published in a LOP
      with the effected unit. If vehicle operations are required, vehicles will use parking lights
      while in transit and turn off all lights when stopped.
      10.43.1.5. Responsibilities:
      10.43.1.5.1.   AMOPS shall:
             10.43.1.5.1.1. Inform AOF/CC or ATCT Chief Controller of scheduled NVD
             operations.

             lighting. If able, provide this advisory 10 minutes prior.
             10.43.1.5.2.8. Advise AMOPS when operations are complete or suspended so
             they can check to ensure all foreign objects have been removed from
             runways/taxiways before normal operations are resumed.
             10.43.1.5.2.9. Use the following phraseology: “UNABLE TO ISSUE
             DEPARTURE/ LANDING/ TOUCH-AND-GO CLEARANCE. DEPARTURE/
             LANDING/ TOUCH-AND-GO WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK”
             10.43.1.5.2.10. Tower cab lighting should be kept to the absolute minimum to
             allow normal tower functions.
         10.43.1.5.3. RAPCON shall:
             10.43.1.5.3.1. Advise ATCT as soon as possible upon receipt of a request from
             an aircraft to conduct NVD operations.
             10.43.1.5.3.2. Provide/relay to ATCT traffic advisories that will affect
             participating NVD aircraft outside the TSA.
         10.43.1.5.4. Emergency and Safety Termination of NVD Operations: Any agency
         may call “KNOCK IT OFF” if a safety concern is raised. NVD operations will be
         terminated if any participating/non-participating aircraft emergency is anticipated or
         declared.

10.44.6. ATC Procedures:
      10.44.6.1. Aircrew will advise Kunsan Tower via radio or recorded landline (DSN 782-
      5800) the initiation and completion of flight activities. All communication between
      aircrew and ATC will be over primary ATC frequencies, unless the use of recorded
      landline communications is deemed necessary.
      10.44.6.2. Describe RPA to other aircraft by stating “unmanned aircraft”.
      10.44.6.3. RPA aircrew will not be instructed to follow other aircraft. Visual separation
      between RPA and manned aircraft or RPA and RPA is not authorized. This does not
      restrict the tower controller’s ability to visually separate aircraft.
      10.44.6.4. For the purposes of ATC separation and sequencing, classify the RPA as
      “Category III”, subject to change dependant on appropriate guidance.
      10.44.6.5. Advise adjacent approach control facilities that RPA operations are being
      conducted or terminated.
      10.44.6.6. RPA operations are not authorized simultaneously with civil aircraft

     10.44.6.7. ATC will advise aircrew of any transient aircraft which may impact
     operations.
     10.44.6.8. In the event of an emergency involving the RPA, ATC will apply procedures
     listed in Chapter 10 of JO 7110.65. The safety of all manned aircraft will take
     precedence over unmanned aircraft in the event of an emergency.
     10.44.6.9. ATC shall notify aircrew of any No Radio (NORDO) aircraft which may
     impact RPA operations. If unable to contact NORDO aircraft, ATC will coordinate with
     the RPA aircrew to determine the course of action method to ensure safe operations of all
     aircraft.
     10.44.6.10. Tower shall make a broadcast on the ATIS when RPA operations are in
     effect. Example: “unmanned aircraft operations are in progress”.
  10.44.7. Standard Flight Profile:
     10.44.7.1. The aircraft will takeoff from the active runway, fly runway heading to 3
     DME from KUZ VOR, then turn left (departures off Runway 36) or right (departures off
     Runway 18) to join the KUZ 270 radial to enter the Military Operations Area (MOA)
     complex. Other standard flight profiles will be Pack 401/402 flight plans.
     10.44.7.2. Due to the inability to taxi over cables, any raised cables will be removed for
     takeoff and landing operations. During all other times, cables will remain in standard
     configuration.
     10.44.7.3. All VFR and radar traffic patterns will be to the west of Kunsan.
  10.44.8. Lost Link/Lost Communication Procedures:
     10.44.8.1. During lost link or in-flight emergencies, aircraft will squawk 7600 or as
     programmed in accordance with the local guidance. Aircrew will use a separate land-
     based radio or telephone to ensure continued communication with ATC or COBRA
     during any lost link events.
     10.44.8.2. In the event of a lost link or lost communication between RPA aircrew and
     ATC, ATC will:
         10.44.8.2.1. Cease aircraft launches until status of affected RPA is determined.
         10.44.8.2.2. Issue advisories and ATC instructions as appropriate to ensure safe
         operations.
     10.44.8.3. The Primary Crash Alert System will be activated for all lost link events.

      8 SFS AND AMOPS DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS AND CRITICAL AREA
                          PROTECTION POINTS

A18.1. Protection Plan 1: Runway 36 in use. When weather is reported or forecast below
800 ft ceiling and/or less than 2 miles visibility and the PAR or ILS Protection Light System is
out of service. ATCT will contact 8 SFS and AMOPS to implement this Critical Area Protection
Plan. SFS will notify ATCT via Tower Net, direct landline or 782-5800 once all units are in
place. AMOPS will notify ATCT via the Tower Net, direct landline or 782-5800 once
notification and inspection of the flightline critical areas are completed.
Note: When the reported or forecasted ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or 800M visibility,
ATCT will implement these procedures when primary means are unusable regardless of PAR
status.

Note: Physical Protection of the critical is required until the Critical Area Protection System
lights are operational. This plan will also be used during periods of Critical Area Protection
System failure.
   A18.1.1. 8 SFS Response Instructions:
       A18.1.1.1. Operations: The following points require physical protection: SF1 and SF2.
       A18.1.1.2. SF1 is located on Ave “B”, just north of the intersection of Ave “B” (near the
       Tree Area) and the ROKAF Alert Pad entrance.
           A18.1.1.2.1. Action: Allow only launch essential vehicles, mission support vehicles
           and end of runway (EOR) crews beyond this point. Do not allow vehicles to proceed
           past the intersection of Ave “B” and the ROKAF alert area. There can be no vehicle
           traffic on perimeter road in between SF1 and SF2. An 8 SFS unit must verify there
           is no vehicle traffic in between these points. 8 SFS will notify ATCT via landline or
           Tower Net when the area is clear.
       A18.1.1.3. SF2 is located on Avenue “A” just south of the perimeter road entrance (next
       to the KAL gate).
           A18.1.1.3.1. Action: Do not allow vehicles to proceed between SF2 and SF1 on
           perimeter road. No vehicle traffic may proceed on perimeter road between SF2 and
           SF1 without direct communication with the Control Tower. All vehicle access must
           be approved by Control Tower.
A18.2. Protection Plan 2: Runway 18 in use. When weather is reported or forecast below
800 ft ceiling and/or less than 2 miles visibility and the PAR is out of service, ATCT will contact
8 SFS and AMOPS to implement this Critical Area Protection Plan. There is one additional
point that requires protection by SFS. This point is SF3.
   A18.2.1. 8 SFS Response Instructions
       A18.2.1.1. Operations: The following points require physical protection: SF1, SF2, and
       SF3

      A18.2.1.2. SF1 is location on Ave “B”, just north of the intersection of Ave “B” (near
      the Tree Area) and the ROKAF Alert Pad entrance.
         A18.2.1.2.1. Action: Allow only launch essential vehicles, mission support vehicles
         and end of runway (EOR) crews beyond this point. Do not allow vehicles to proceed
         past the intersection of Ave “B” and the ROKAF alert area. There can be no vehicle
         traffic on perimeter road in between SF1 and SF2. An 8 SFS unit must verify there
         is no vehicle traffic in between these points. SFS will notify ATCT when the area is
         clear.
      A18.2.1.3. SF2 Location: Avenue “A” just south of the perimeter road entrance (next to
      the KAL gate).
         A18.2.1.3.1. Action: Do not allow vehicles to proceed between SF2 and SF1 on
         perimeter road. No vehicle traffic may proceed on perimeter road between SF2 and
         SF1 without direct communication with the Control Tower. All vehicle access must
         be approved by Control Tower.
      A18.2.1.4. SF3 Location: Avenue A and the intersection of 5th street (at base gas
      station).
         A18.2.1.4.1. Action: Do not allow vehicles to proceed into the intersection, north
         toward SF2. There can be no traffic between points SF2 and SF3. 8 SFS personnel
         should route traffic through the base gas station to avoid the intersection. It is
         permissible to set cones on the pavement to route traffic through the base gas station.
      A18.2.1.5. ATCT will only allow fighter type aircraft or smaller beyond instrument hold
      lines on Taxiway P (glideslope area) in this weather plan. When weather is less than 200
      ft ceiling and/or 800M visibility, ATCT will restrict all vehicle and aircraft access IAW
      AFI 13-204.
