SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Adds the
requirement for the Base Records Manager (BRM) to be the approval authority for all Luke Air
Force Base (LUKEAFB) file plans (paragraph 6.4.1.6.). Adds the requirement that the BRM
may conduct random no-notice spot checks of the offices of record under each Functional Area
Records Manager’s (FARM) jurisdiction (paragraph 6.4.1.13.). Establishes the requirement for
each group commander/unit commander to appoint a primary and alternate FARM. Adds the
requirement to retire all fiscal year records NLT 1 November and retire calendar year records
NLT 15 February (paragraph 6.5.12.). FARMs will pick up records that have expired and put
them in recycling bins. Squadrons will assume the cost of shredding Privacy Act (PA) records
(paragraph 6.5.12.). Requires all FARMs and Records Custodian (RC) to complete initial
training. Requires FARMs, Chiefs of Office of Record (COR), and RCs to complete training in
Advanced Distribution Learning Service (ADLS) located on the portal. Adds Attachment 1,
Glossary of References and Supporting Information; Attachment 2, Sample FARM Appointment
Letter; and Attachment 3, Sample RC Appointment Letter.
4.5. Each group commander/unit commander will appoint in writing a primary and alternate
FARM and provide appointment letter (Attachment 2) to the BRM.
6.2. The COR is the senior person assigned to the office (responsible for the function of the
office) and cannot delegate this responsibility to another person for purposes of maintaining
records. The COR must sign the file plan as outlined in AFMAN 33-363, paragraph 6.2.4 The
COR is a presumed position and an appointment letter is not required.
6.2.5. The COR appoints an individual assigned to the office as the RC within 2 weeks of the
RC vacancy. The COR briefs the RC on the functional mission of the office records and
documents the briefing on the appointment letter. The COR forwards the appointment letter
(Attachment 3) to the FARM. The COR is responsible for ensuring the perpetual review letter is
reviewed annually to ensure the records filed in the ERM/Non-ERM server are current and
essential.
6.2.10. The COR is responsible for identifying vital records within their office of record. Refer
to AFI 33-364, Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, paragraph 2.9., for
clarification and guidance. In case of natural disaster, see ANNEX U to 56 FW OPLAN 10-2.
The COR cannot delegate this responsibility. Each office of record will maintain a list of their
paper/electronic vital records under “Precedent Files – Table 33-45, Rule 9.” The primary
FARM will consolidate a Vital Records Plan for the offices of record under their unit.
6.4.1.6. The BRM is the approval authority for all Luke AFB file plans. The COR and RC
should review file plans to ensure they reflect the tables and rules necessary for the office prior
to submitting to the FARM. The FARM submits the file plan to the BRM for approval.
6.4.1.13. The BRM will perform a staff visit on 10 percent of each FARM’s offices of record
using the AFRIMS checklist. The BRM will rate the office of record and give a 30-day
suspense. After 30 days, the staff visit is closed. The BRM will perform a unit staff visit every
24 months using the AFRIMS checklist. The BRM will rate the unit and give a 30-day suspense.
The BRM may conduct random spot checks of offices of record under each FARM’s
jurisdiction.

6.4.1.13.1. (Added) The BRM will assist the FARM to ensure the structures of ERM and Non-
ERM folders are correct. The ERM and Non-ERM folders will mirror the file plan. A file plan
must be in place before creating folders in ERM or Non-ERM. The Non-ERM structure should
have three folders containing the following: 1) Common - These are records that an office of
record needs to share with other offices. 2) Templates/Reference - Blank forms, sample letters
and copies of AFIs. 3) Working - Records in this folder are not completed. They are usually
projects currently being worked.
6.4.1.13.2. (Added) The files maintenance and disposition folder in ERM will contain the
following records. 1) Appointment Letter, 2) File Plan and Signed Cover Sheet, 3) Permissions,
4) Perpetual Record Review Letter, 5) Staff Visits and Follow-ups, 6) Training Certificate and 7)
Waiver Letters.
6.5.1. All CORs, RCs and FARMs will complete training in ADLS located on the Air Force
Portal. Once the COR and RC complete their training, they forward a copy of the training
certificate to the FARM who updates AFRIMS within 48 hours. This training and an AFRIMS
account must be completed before the FARM can schedule personnel to attend the BRM
training. If the past due training appears red in AFRIMS, the account will be deleted. During
FARM’s staff visits, FARMs are required to provide one-on-one training to all personnel within
their squadron. The FARM will train on local procedures for using ERM. Ensure all offices of
record under their responsibility have implemented and are utilizing ERM. FARMs will ensure
that CORs and RCs are trained within 3 months after being assigned. Personnel who are
scheduled for and fail to attend the Basic Records Management class (without 48 hours advanced
notice), will be identified as a “no-show.” The respective commander will be notified.
6.5.3. The FARM will place a completed AFRIMS Checklist for each office of record visited in
the unit’s ERM folder (Item #1 Files Maintenance and Disposition Schedule). FARMs will
complete follow-up actions as required and annotate the date of the staff visit in AFRIMS. The
ratings in AFRIMS of ‘Sat” and “Unsat” will be used. If an office of record received an “unsat,”
there is automatic 30-day suspense. Correct the discrepancies and post the corrections in
AFRIMS under “responses/posting.”
6.5.12. (Added) FARMs will ensure timely retirement of eligible records and review the SF
135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, in AFRIMS before the RC forwards to the BRM for
approval. Retire all fiscal year records NLT 1 November. Retire calendar year records NLT 15
February. If the COR chooses to keep the records in his/her office, a waiver letter is forwarded
to the BRM for approval. If records are not maintained correctly, the BRM will revoke the
waiver and the records will have to be staged. The BRM maintains the original copy of the SF
135. FARMs will pickup and recycle records that have expired. Squadrons will assume the cost
for shredding PA records.
6.5.13. (Added) The FARM is also the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and PA monitor
for their group/squadron.
