SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It updates,
clarifies, and streamlines previous guidance with this newly revised basic instruction.
1.9.2. The flight commander (Flt/CC) nominates DGs. The squadron commander has final
approval authority on DG selection. DG selection is not required if no students in a class
perform well above the course training standards and in a superior manner compared to his/her
peers.
2.3.1. The Flt/CC will review the student’s Physical Fitness Log weekly.
3.1.2.1. Flying CAP includes 3 types: Increased G, and Airsickness.
3.1.2.3. Substandard academic performance is defined as failing one academic test.
3.1.3.1.1. Students will be placed on increased status if recommended on AETC IMT 1122,
Summary Performance Report, or for failing two or more JSUPT checkrides, or failing two IFF
syllabus sorties, or two IFF simulators graded Effective/Non-Effective for Student Non-
Progression (E/NE-SNP).
3.1.3.1.2. Students will be placed on G-CAP who complete centrifuge training with an
acceleration training report grade less than 2, receive an unsatisfactory score on the fighter
aircrew conditioning test (FACT), exhibit AGSM deficiencies, or experience a G Incident
requiring special attention to their AGSM execution and G tolerance.
3.1.3.1.3. Students will be placed on Airsickness CAP who experience airsickness problems
severe enough to detract from mission performance.
3.1.3.1.4. Students will be placed on Academic CAP who fails one academic test. The student
will not be removed from CAP until he/she is academic complete.
3.1.3.2.1. Students on CAP will only fly one syllabus sortie per day unless approved by the
SQ/DO or SQ/CC. Note: Syllabus simulators will not count towards “one syllabus sortie per
day”, and Non Syllabus Directed (NSD) sorties are highly encouraged.
3.1.3.2.2. Students on Flying CAP: INCREASED status will fly with up to four assigned
instructor pilots (IPs), Flt/CCs, the DO, or the CC. This restriction applies to the IP of Record,
not the Direct Support IP. Flt/CCs should continually assess student performance, consider the
number of sorties remaining in the syllabus, and may further restrict the number of IPs for
appropriate continuity.
3.1.3.2.8. The following procedures apply to G CAP students:
AETC36-2205V6_VANCEAFBSUP 9 DECEMBER 2011                                                     3


3.1.3.2.8.1. Upon initial placement on G CAP, the Flt/CC will refer the student to the Aerospace
Physiologist for physical conditioning and AGSM counseling.
3.1.3.2.8.2. The Flt/CC and the Aerospace Physiologist (if available) will conduct a heads up
display (HUD) AGSM review on F-2, OB-1, and any other sortie deemed necessary by the
Flt/CC.
3.1.3.2.8.3. IPs will emphasize AGSM use and instruction during all flight briefings and
debriefings. The IP will write a comment on every sortie gradesheet regarding AGSM
performance until the student is removed from G CAP.
3.1.3.3. Consideration for removal from CAP will be made based on the type of CAP and the
time left in the program. If removal from CAP is feasible, goals will be documented and tracked
on the AF IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling or through the Training Integration
Management System (TIMS).
5.1.1. Documentation of grade sheets and grade books, academic, simulator, and specialized
training will be completed and remain in TIMS.
5.3.2. Break in continuity will be documented with the Continuity Break TIMS template in the
student’s electronic gradebook.
5.3.4. Additional sorties will be documented with the ADD Ride TIMS template in the student’s
electronic gradebook.
5.3.11. Document placement/removal on/from CAP using CAP letter templates in Attachments
2-5 to this supplement. Place this letter on the front cover of the student training binder.
Additionally, scheduling and the Top-3 should receive a copy for record. Document CAP
placement and removal in the student training binder on an AF IMT 174. Once removed from
CAP, move the CAP placement letter from the front cover to before the AF IMT 174.
Additionally, place the CAP Removal Memorandum for Record (MFR) found in attachment 5 in
from of the CAP Placement letter.
