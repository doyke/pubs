This instruction implements DoD Instruction 6055.1, DoD Safety and Occupational Health
Program and AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements. It establishes local methods and
procedures to be used when identifying, initiating, analyzing, evaluating, approving, validating,
and reviewing the basis for paying Environmental Differential Pay (EDP) or Hazard Pay
Differential (HPD). Air Force management philosophy has always been to eliminate or alleviate
the hazard so that the workplace (working environment) meets or exceeds prevailing safety
standards. The object is to assure that all hazardous situations, physical hardship and working
conditions of an unusually severe nature are eliminated or reduced to the lowest level possible.
It applies to all Department of the Air Force Appropriated Fund (DAF APF) civilians and AFRC
(Air Force Reserve Command) Air Reserve Technician (ART) civilians exposed to known
environmental/hazardous conditions in the performance of their duties. It implements applicable
parts of Title 5 United States Code, Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR) and the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management Federal Wage System Operating Manual. By law, Federal agencies are
required to follow OSHA safety and health standards in order to protect employees from a
significant risk of material health or functional impairment that may be experienced because of
hazards in the workplace. EDP/Hazard pay shall be discontinued when safety precautions have
reduced the element of hazard to a less than significant level of risk, consistent with generally
accepted standards that may be applicable, such as those published by OSHA. This publication
does not apply to ANG (Air National Guard) or Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) personnel.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed
of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

changes include:
1. DEFINITION: DAF APF civilian employees exposed, while performing their assigned
duties, to a hazard, physical hardship, or working condition of an unusually severe nature that
has not been practically eliminated by use of protective devices, engineering design changes,

     differentials, Subpart I, and Appendix A.
     1.2. Federal Wage System (FWS) Employees (i.e., Wage Grade (WG), Wage Leader (WL),
     Wage Supervisor (WS)). 5 CFR, Part 532.511, Environmental Differentials, and U.S. Office
     of Personnel Management Federal Wage System Operating Manual, Subchapter 8 Pay

     environmental Engineering (355 AMDS/SGPB), Civilian Personnel Section (355
     FSS/FSMC), and Safety Office (355 FW/SE or 309 AMARG/QP-SE, as appropriate) will be
     fully knowledgeable of the prescribing directives in order to discharge their responsibilities.
     2.2. Specific:
        2.2.1. Civilian employees must make their immediate supervisor aware of any work
        situation(s) they believe to be unsafe and would qualify for EDP or HPD. Employees are
        responsible for following established work methods and safety procedures and using
        prescribed protective devices.
        2.2.2. Supervisors will:
            2.2.2.1. Answer employee questions about EDP or HPD.
            2.2.2.2. Identify within their function work situations specified in applicable
            directives that are authorized EDP or HPD.
            2.2.2.3. Encourage employees to identify unsafe work situations and consider their
            suggestions about how to eliminate such situations or actions that might be taken to
            protect employees where practical elimination of the hazard is not possible.

NOTE: The Air Force created AF Form 683 for requesting EDP. Use is not restricted, but the
form may not be revised in any way. When using AF Form 683 for requesting HPD, specify that
the request is for Hazard Pay Differential in accordance with 5 CFR (Code of Federal
Regulations) Part 550.901, Subpart I, and Appendix A. For NSPS positions requesting HPD,
reference DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapter 1930 Compensation Architecture Pay Policy, SC1930.25
and Appendix 5. If needed, samples of completed AF Form 683 are available upon request from
355 FSS/FSMC.
SECTION II
Coordination and Concurrence
The civilian personnel office will forward one copy of AF Form 683 with all attachments to bio-
environmental engineers, safety officers, and local union officials for technical review,
investigation, opinion, and recommendation. The safety and bio-environmental technical
representatives will provide a written assessment/recommendation to the civilian personnel
office based on their areas of expertise. The civilian personnel officer will consider the technical
review recommendations and make final approval/disapproval determination.
SECTION III
Final Disposition
The civilian personnel section will electronically forward a copy of each approved situation to
bio-environmental engineering, safety, finance, the local union, recommending official and
immediate supervisor. The civilian personnel representative will meet with the requesting
supervisor to obtain supervisorâ€™s signature on the original AF Form 683, acknowledging receipt
of the document. The original signature AF Form 683 is retained by 355 FSS/FSMC. The
supervisor will apprise the employee(s) concerned and furnish them a copy. If differential pay
request is disapproved, the civilian personnel section will forward one copy to bio-environmental
engineering, safety, recommending official, immediate supervisor and employee(s) concerned
with explanatory comments and informing employees of their grievance rights under the
negotiated agreement.
