                                          AUDIT REPORTS

1.1. Overview. The AFAA is the sole provider of internal audit services to the Air Force, and a report is
the usual product of an AFAA audit. This chapter provides information on processing AFAA audit reports
and tracking the implementation of report recommendations. Attachment 3 identifies report processing
responsibilities. In addition, public accountants audit nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities and issue
reports following policy in AFPD 65-3. Chapter 5 contains information on public accountant audits and
reports of NAF activities.
1.1. (AMC) Within HQ AMC, HQ AMC/A87F serves as the command audit focal point (AFP) for man-
aging and coordinating all AFAA matters. The designated AMC staff Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) is responsible for providing adequate working space for AFAA auditors during the visit. For AMC
activities, the comptroller function serves as the installation AFP. For AMC organizations where a comp-
troller function does not exist, the unit or organization commander will designate a focal point. Notify
HQ AMC/A87F of the name, FAX, e-mail address, and telephone number of the designated AFP, and
update as necessary. The installation AFP is responsible for monitoring and coordinating all facets of
AFAA visits to their installation.

1.2. Audit Process. AFAA uses an audit process that attempts to make the most efficient and effective
use of audit resources. Prior to announcing an audit, AFAA conducts substantial preliminary research to
identify appropriate audit subjects that AFAA includes in a plan it provides to management annually. The
process permits flexibility and timely adjustment of audit requirements due to changes in Air Force policy
and emphasis.
   1.2.1. Audit Phases. Each audit consists of three phases: research, application, and report processing.
   The research phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives and thoroughly plan the
   audit. The research phase culminates with development of the audit program which provides the ana-
   lytical methodology for a thorough examination designed to disclose deficiencies and their underlying
   causes and impact. During the application phase, auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit
   results and provide a basis for specific recommendations. At the conclusion of field work, the AFAA
   prepares a draft report that presents identified audit results and recommendations so management can
   take appropriate corrective actions without the need for further review or study. AFAA releases the
   draft report to management for formal comments. After receiving the management comments, AFAA
   adds them to the final report, along with an AFAA evaluation, and distributes the final report. Desig-
   nated activities formally track the final report until management indicates it has implemented all the
   agreed-to actions. Follow-up audits determine whether actions taken by management corrected cited
   deficiencies.
   1.2.2. Deconflicting Audits. Before starting each audit, AFAA first determines if conducting the
   audit would adversely affect the units involved. AFAA will defer the audit start or select other loca-
   tions when the unit is experiencing significant operational demands (i.e., deployments, exercises, or
   inspections) and conducting the audit would conflict with the unusual workload demands. Deconflict-
   ing audits is accomplished through coordination with base, major command (MAJCOM), field oper-
   ating agency (FOA), direct reporting unit (DRU), and Air National Guard (ANG) gatekeepers.
   NOTE: Throughout the remainder of this instruction, MAJCOM is used as a collective term to denote
   “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and ANG.”

    1.2.3. Audit Limitation. Internal audits do not criticize responsible management decisions. Most
    management decisions involve some degree of risk and uncertainty. Even when later events show the
    wrong decision was made, this, by itself, does not mandate an audit report. Unsuccessful decisions
    become subject to audit when they result in inefficient operations, inadequate procedures, or other
    deficiencies and when reporting them would lead to improving systems, procedures, or avoiding
    future errors.

1.3. Types of Reports.
    1.3.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA Air Force-level audit reports are the result of centrally man-
    aged, single or multi-site, audits that the AFAA addresses to the Secretariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM.
    AFAA also provides these reports to the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptrol-
    ler (SAF/FM) for tracking recommendations and to the Department of Defense Inspector General
    (DODIG) for information. The AFAA issues two types of Air Force-level reports: standard and
    interim.
       1.3.1.1. Standard Report. The standard report (also known as a “blue book”) represents the nor-
       mal reporting vehicle for conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
       1.3.1.2. Interim Report. AFAA issues interim reports (a) when audit results require prompt man-
       agement attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction) or (b) to convey the audit status for a
       lengthy audit (preliminary). The interim report provides management an opportunity to initiate
       early corrective actions on identified findings and for AFAA to acknowledge those actions in the
       audit report.
    1.3.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA installation-level audit reports result from single-site audits
    covering issues specific to an activity or installation. The AFAA issues four types of installation-level
    reports: regular, special, interim, and Commanders Audit Program (CAP).
       1.3.2.1. Regular Report. The regular report is the most commonly issued installation-level
       report. AFAA area audit offices use regular reports to convey the installation-level results of
       locally initiated and centrally directed audits.
       1.3.2.2. Special Report. Special reports convey the results of audits that identify significant mat-
       ters. The findings in these reports usually involve issues such as unlawful activities or other con-
       ditions that could embarrass the Air Force.
       1.3.2.2. (AMC) Upon receipt of a special report of audit, the installation AFP will immediately
       notify AMC/A87F by e-mail or telephone. Process a special report of audit in the same manner as
       a regular report of audit. Within HQ AMC, HQ AMC/A87F will notify the command section
       through           HQ AMC/A87 and appropriate AMC OPRs and collateral responsibility (OCR)
       of receipt and contents of a special report of audit. In reference to the commander's audit program
       (CAP): Commanders may request an audit under the provision of the CAP or under regular audit
       coverage. You must contact the servicing AFAA area audit office for further information on
       requesting a CAP audit. Commanders, managers, and supervisors should place continued empha-
       sis on developing and recommending procedures to prevent future deficiencies.
       1.3.2.3. Interim Report. AFAA area audit offices issue interim reports for the reasons cited in
       paragraph 1.3.1.2.
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                     7


       1.3.2.4. Commanders Audit Program Report. CAP reports convey results from a personalized
       audit tailored to specific issues in organizations under the jurisdiction of the requesting com-
       mander.

1.4. Draft Report Processing. The AFAA sends draft reports to tenant, installation, MAJCOM, Air
Staff, or Secretariat officials, as appropriate, for comments. Attachment 3 provides a list of responsibili-
ties for processing draft Air Force-level reports.
1.4. (AMC) On receipt of an AFAA draft audit report for comment, the installation AFP will perform the
following: Send the draft report to appropriate functional offices to prepare management comments,
coordinate on all responses to draft reports to ensure management has addressed each finding, recommen-
dation, and potential monetary benefit, and ensure management comments are provided to AFAA by the
suspense date.
   1.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA simultaneously distributes (e-mails) draft reports to the Sec-
   retariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) and applicable offices of col-
   lateral responsibility (OCRs).
   1.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA e-mails each draft report to the designated unit audit
   focal point who forwards it to the functional OPR for comment. The audit focal point acts as a liaison
   officer between management and AFAA and monitors audit project and report processes, including
   follow-up tracking. AFAA addresses installation-level reports to the appropriate commander and,
   except for CAP reports, to other units having oversight authority (e.g., MAJCOM). AFAA limits dis-
   tribution of CAP reports to the requesting commander and the unit commander.

1.5. Management Comments. Management will respond in writing (e-mail responses are acceptable) to
all draft audit reports containing recommendations or potential monetary benefits (PMB). Reference para-
graph 1.5.3. for potential responses. AFAA includes management comments verbatim, along with an
audit evaluation, in the final report. The management OPR and AFAA auditors will coordinate closely so
the final report fully documents management’s position on issues in the report. NOTE: Management may
verbally coordinate on reports that do not contain recommendations or PMB.
1.5. (AMC) The installation AFP will ensure management comments are clear, concise, and complete.
Comments must address each finding, recommendation, and potential monetary benefit. Management is
not required to provide additional comments for findings with which they concur, but they are required to
provide management comments for each recommendation. Management should include the name, office
symbol, and telephone number of their point of contact in their comments. (See Attachment 4 (Added)
for sample format; use it only as a guide). Installation AFPs will provide the MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/
A87F a copy of management comments to draft installation level AFAA and PACA reports. On issuance
of the final report, the AFAA area audit office will forward the report to HQ AMC/A87F with an informa-
tion copy to the numbered Air Force (NAF).
   1.5.1. Comments Requirements. Management will write comments concisely and include:
       1.5.1.1. A statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence on each finding, recommendation, and
       PMB.
       1.5.1.2. Appropriate comments describing intended or completed corrective actions and an actual
       or estimated completion date for each corrective action. If corrective actions will take longer than
8                                                   AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005


       a year, the management comments should contain interim milestones for completing major seg-
       ments or action.
       1.5.1.3. Rationale for any disagreements.
       1.5.1.4. Comments on the reasonableness of all auditor-estimated PMB. See Chapter 4 for fur-
       ther information on PMB. NOTE: When management corrects deficiencies during the audit, the
       draft report normally presents the findings and recognizes management's actions in lieu of a rec-
       ommendation. If the report contains PMB, management must still comment on the reasonableness
       of the PMB estimate.
    1.5.2. Suspense Dates. For reports with recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows manage-
    ment 30 calendar days from the date of the draft report to provide written comments. For interim
    reports, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days. For reports with no recommendations
    or PMB, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days to provide a verbal or e-mail concur-
    rence and 30 days to provide a written response.
       1.5.2.1. The AFAA can grant extensions for management comments in unusual circumstances. If
       management cannot respond by the due date, the management OPR telephones or e-mails the
       AFAA and requests an extension. AFAA can grant extensions, usually in 15-day increments, not
       to exceed 30 days from the original suspense date.
       1.5.2.1. (AMC) Management will coordinate all requests for extensions through the installation
       AFP. Within HQ AMC, the OPR will coordinate requests through MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/
       A87F.
       1.5.2.2. For oral requests exceeding 15 days from the original suspense date, the management
       OPR will follow up with a written request (e-mail is acceptable) that includes both the reasons for
       the delay and a firm date when AFAA can expect to get management comments.
    1.5.3. Potential Responses. The following list provides potential responses to audit recommenda-
    tions. See Attachment 2 for specific examples of management comments.
       1.5.3.1. If management agrees with the findings, recommendations, and PMB, the management
       comments will describe corrective actions, both taken or planned, and give actual or planned com-
       pletion dates. Planned completion dates should be at least 90 days from the date comments are
       provided. Reference paragraph A2.1.
       1.5.3.2. If management agrees with the findings and agrees action is required but not the actions
       recommended in the report, management can concur with intent and propose other ways to correct
       the reported deficiencies. The response must explain what action management will take to correct
       the problem. AFAA does not consider such responses as nonresponsive if the alternative action
       would correct the problem. Reference paragraph A2.2.
       1.5.3.3. If management agrees with the findings and recommendations but disagrees with the
       PMB, management must clearly state the reason for disagreement and give a revised PMB esti-
       mate. If management disagrees there will be any PMB, the AFAA will elevate the entire amount
       as a nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. If management agrees there
       will be a PMB, but specifies a lesser amount, the AFAA will elevate only the difference between
       the management estimate and the AFAA estimate. Reference paragraph A2.3.
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                    9


       1.5.3.4. If management nonconcurs with any finding, management comments should specify the
       reason for the nonconcurrence. The AFAA will elevate the nonconcurrence for resolution in
       accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.4.
       1.5.3.5. If management concurs with the finding but does not agree corrective actions are neces-
       sary, management should explicitly agree with the finding and explain the reason corrective
       actions are not appropriate. The AFAA audit team will elevate the nonconcurrence for resolution
       in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.5..
   1.5.4. Disagreements. Management will notify AFAA immediately if they disagree with any report
   finding, recommendation, or PMB. Management can meet with AFAA and explain their position on
   the points of disagreement or introduce new information. These discussions promote effective correc-
   tive action by clarifying audit findings, recommendations, and PMB. AFAA may revise the draft
   report after discussions with management.

1.6. Management Comments Evaluation. After the management OPR provides comments to AFAA,
the AFAA audit team will evaluate the comments to determine if they meet the requirements of paragraph
1.5.1. and corrective actions, taken or proposed, are adequate and timely. When management comments
are not responsive or when management does not provide comments within the required time, AFAA fol-
lows the procedures described in Chapter 3. When management comments are responsive, the AFAA
audit team inserts the comments and an AFAA evaluation into the final report and distributes the report.

1.7. Revised Report Procedures. If, after issuing a draft report for comment, the audit management
team revises the report (paragraph 1.5.4.), the audit team will reissue the report for comment. AFAA will
allow management an appropriate amount of time to comment on the revised report, not to exceed 30
days.
   1.7.1. Air Force-Level Reports. The Air Force Audit Agency, Pentagon Liaison Office (SAF/AGA)
   distributes copies of the revised Air Force-level report to the HQ USAF OPR and all other activities
   that received the initial draft report.
   1.7.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA team chief distributes the revised report to the unit
   audit focal point and other activities that received the initial draft report.

1.8. Final Report Distribution.
   1.8.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final reports to applicable HQ USAF offices,
   SAF/FM, the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, applicable MAJCOMs, and the DODIG. AFAA also pre-
   pares follow-up tracking sheets and forwards them to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial
   Operations (SAF/FMP). SAF/FMP personnel monitor and report on the implementation of corrective
   actions agreed to in Air Force-level audit reports.
   1.8.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final installation-level reports to responsible unit
   officials and, except for CAP reports, to applicable MAJCOM audit focal points. The audit focal
   points, in turn, track the recommendations and ensure management implements all agreed-to correc-
   tive actions. NOTE: Due to the limited distribution of CAP reports (pararaph 1.4.2.), implementation
   of CAP report recommendations is monitored informally at installation level. CAP reports do not con-
   tain PMB.

1.9. Report Availability. The draft report is an internal Air Force action document and is not widely dis-
tributed. However, the final audit report is a historical document for use by internal and external organiza-
tions. Within the Air Force, management and auditors use the final report for reference. Outside the Air
Force, government agencies such as the DODIG; the Government Accountability Office; and the Con-
gress have access to the report. AFAA releases final reports to the public, when requested, under the Free-
dom of Information Act.
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                    11


                                                Chapter 2

                                    ACCESS TO INFORMATION

2.1. Overview. Air Force management grants AFAA auditors access to information according to AFPD
65-3. This chapter provides guidance for resolving access-related disagreements.
2.1. (AMC) AMC personnel will permit properly cleared AFAA personnel prompt access to Air
Force-controlled information needed for the auditor's evaluation. It is Air Force policy to cooperate with
the auditors in executing their official duties. However, access to operation plans (OPLAN) and any sup-
porting documentation is extremely sensitive and requires special treatment. Release of information
should be on a need-to-know basis and should be carefully limited to those documents or portions of doc-
uments directly related to the audit. If questions arise concerning the access/releasability of an OPLAN or
any other information, contact the local AFP or MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/A87F who in turn will assist.

2.2. Elevation of Disagreements.
   2.2.1. If an installation refuses to allow access to needed information, the auditor sends written notice
   to the AFAA representative who attempts to resolve the issue with the MAJCOM OPR. If discussions
   with the MAJCOM OPR do not result in access to requested information within 7 calendar days of the
   disagreement, the AFAA representative forwards the request and the MAJCOM position to SAF/
   AGA.
   2.2.2. If management denies access for an Air Force-level audit and the AFAA directorate does not
   resolve the issue, the Assistant Auditor General forwards the request and the results of any discussions
   to SAF/AGA.

2.3. HQ USAF Discussions. SAF/AGA refers access disagreements to the HQ USAF OPR for review
and possible resolution. If these discussions do not resolve the problem within 15 calendar days of the dis-
agreement, SAF/AGA refers the request, along with MAJCOM and HQ USAF positions, to SAF/AG who
submits the package to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) for decision.

2.4. SECAF Decision. The SECAF makes a decision on the access denial within 30 calendar days of the
disagreement and advises applicable Air Force activities of the decision. In accordance with provisions of
DOD Directive 7600.2, Audit Policies, SAF/AG advises the DODIG when the SECAF decision denies
access.

2.5. Denial of Access to Joint Staff Information. If the involved parties cannot agree to an access
request, or AFAA finds the release conditions unacceptable, the AFAA requests the DODIG to formally
notify the Joint Staff of the disagreement and requests the Joint Staff to give the auditors the information
they need. Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, the Joint Staff must either provide
the needed information or forward a recommendation for denial to the Secretary of Defense for a determi-
nation within 30 calendar days.

                                                Chapter 3

                            NONCONCURRENCES (DISAGREEMENTS)

3.1. Required Resolution. Air Force management and audit officials must resolve all disagreements
within 6 months of the final report date according to AFPD 65-4, Followup on Internal Air Force Audit
Reports and Liaison with External Audit Organizations. Management and audit must try to resolve any
disagreements at the lowest management level possible. If they cannot resolve the problem, AFAA must
move the issues to the next higher level of authority, where they will discuss and resolve the disagree-
ments.
3.1. (AMC) Any reviewing level between the audited activity and AMC may initiate a nonconcurrence
with an audit report. If a reviewing official disagrees with any portion of the report, the official should
document the nonconcurrence and forward to the MAJCOM AFP within 30 days from the date of the
audit report. Management will coordinate all nonconcurrences with the installation AFP.

3.2. Disagreements with Air Force-Level Reports. SAF/AGA refers final reports to SAF/FMP for res-
olution whenever disagreements exist between the AFAA and management officials. SAF/FMP submits
final reports with unresolved issues to the Under Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution.
See AFI 65-403, Follow-up on Internal Air Force Audit Reports, for additional information.

3.3. Nonconcurrences with Installation-Level Reports. If local auditors and management officials dis-
agree on matters in a report, and they cannot resolve the disagreement, the auditors will prepare and issue
the final report containing management’s non-responsive comments and an audit rebuttal. The auditors
will send the report within 5 calendar days to the AFAA MAJCOM representative for resolution with the
MAJCOM functional OPR.
3.3. (AMC) Installation AFP and management officials should work closely with auditors during the
development of management comments. Management should make every effort to resolve disagreements
with audit findings, recommendations, and potential monetary benefits during these discussions. If a non-
concurrence cannot be resolved during the discussion period, management must provide (in manage-
ment's comments) a position that is concise, fully justified and supported, and contains references to
proper regulations or directives. If the potential monetary benefit is being disputed, management must
provide an alternate estimate with rationale to fully support the amount. (See Attachment 5 (Added) for
sample format with a nonconcurrence; use it only as a guide). The installation AFP should ensure the
AFAA and the MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/A87F receives management comments within the established
time frame. Audit reports containing nonconcurrence items are considered open until all nonconcur-
rences have been resolved.
     3.3.1. The MAJCOM OPR will evaluate the audit and local management positions and provide writ-
     ten comments to the AFAA representative and installation officials within 60 calendar days explaining
     the MAJCOM position.
     3.3.1. (AMC) When a nonconcurrence is resolved by a higher level of management, the responsible
     headquarters staff agency must send the results to the audited activity.
        3.3.1.1. When MAJCOM supports the audit position, the OPR can, with AFAA representative
        concurrence, include proposed alternative actions to correct the problem.
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                    13


      3.3.1.2. When MAJCOM supports the management position, the AFAA representative will eval-
      uate the MAJCOM position and either close out the disagreement or elevate it to SAF/AGA for
      resolution with HQ USAF.
   3.3.2. When elevating a disagreement for resolution, the AFAA representative will send SAF/AGA a
   copy of the report, applicable management comments, the MAJCOM written position, and other
   information derived from previous resolution within 90 days of the final report date. The AFAA rep-
   resentative will advise the MAJCOM OPR of this action.
   3.3.3. Working with the HQ USAF OPR, SAF/AGA can take an additional 90 days to resolve the
   nonconcurrence. The SAF/AGA representative will evaluate the HQ USAF OPR position and either
   close out the nonconcurrence or elevate it to SAF/FMP for a final decision.
   3.3.4. SAF/US is the final resolution authority. While SAF/US has delegated authority to decide non-
   concurrences in installation-level issues to SAF/FMP, management or AFAA can appeal the SAF/
   FMP decision to SAF/US.

3.4. Late Management Comments.
   3.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments for Air Force-level
   reports by the last revised due date (not to exceed 60 calendar days from the date of issuance), the
   AFAA audit team, in coordination with SAF/AGA, will contact the Air Force action officer weekly to
   discuss (a) problems encountered, (b) the potential for resolution, and (c) the estimated date to receive
   signed comments. After 75 days, the Auditor General may get involved to resolve the problems delay-
   ing receipt of management comments. After 90 days, the AFAA may issue the final report without
   management comments and submit the report to SAF/FMP for resolution in accordance with para-
   graph 3.3.
   3.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments to the draft report
   within 30 calendar days, the AFAA audit team will meet with unit officials to determine the specific
   cause for the delay and, if appropriate, provide additional time for unit officials to prepare their
   response. If management comments are not received after 60 calendar days, the AFAA will either
   grant additional time or issue the final report without management comments.
      3.4.2.1. If it becomes necessary to issue a final report without management comments, the MAJ-
      COM OPR must act immediately to ensure the subordinate unit commander responds to the audit
      report. If the unit commander provides comments within 60 calendar days after the final report
      date, AFAA will evaluate the comments. If the comments are responsive, AFAA will reissue the
      final report with the management comments and AFAA evaluation inserted. If the comments are
      not responsive, AFAA will send the comments to the MAJCOM OPR for resolution in accordance
      with paragraph 3.3.
      3.4.2.2. If the AFAA receives no comments within 90 calendar days following the final report
      date, the AFAA representative will elevate the report to SAF/AGA for resolution with the appro-
      priate HQ USAF OPR and advise the MAJCOM OPR of this action.

                                                 Chapter 4

                                 POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFITS

4.1. Definition. Potential monetary benefits:
     4.1.1. Is an estimate the AFAA measures and expresses as a dollar value and expects the DOD or the
     Federal Government overall to save if management implements audit recommendations.
     4.1.2. Represents the best estimate or an actual known amount at the time the auditor prepared the
     audit report.
     4.1.3. Can be either funds put to better use or questioned cost, but not both.

4.2. Funds Put to Better Use. Most PMB resulting from internal audit are classified as “funds put to
better use.” “Funds put to better use” means that if management implements the audit recommendations,
funds could be used to meet other requirements. The following list shows examples of actions that result
in “funds put to better use”:
     4.2.1. Reductions in outlays.
     4.2.2. Allowing funds from programs or operations to be deobligated and used in programs or opera-
     tions other than that for which they were originally budgeted.
     4.2.3. Withdrawal of interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.
     4.2.4. Costs avoided by implementing recommended improvements for the operations of the estab-
     lishment, a contractor, or a grantee.
     4.2.5. Avoiding unnecessary spending noted in pre-award reviews of contract or grant agreements.
     4.2.6. Reduction to any approved requirement, either funded or unfunded.

4.3. Questioned Cost. When an auditor questions an incurred cost because of one of the following fac-
tors, it is known as “questioned cost”:
4.3. (AMC) If validation finds "potential monetary benefit (PMB)" inaccurate, the MAJCOM AFP,
HQ AMC/A87F should initiate a nonconcurrence with the PMB.
     4.3.1. An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative agreement,
     or other agreement or document that governs the expenditure of funds.
     4.3.2. A cost that, at the time of the audit, is not supported by adequate documentation.
     4.3.2. (AMC) Coordinate the results of the validation with the functional OPR and the financial anal-
     ysis office. (HQ AMC/A87F is responsible for verifying the appropriations data in part II of the PMB
     statement.)
     4.3.3. An expenditure of funds that is unnecessary or unreasonable for the intended purpose (applica-
     ble to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).

4.4. Disallowed Cost. When management, in a management decision, sustains or agrees a questioned
cost should not be charged to the government, it is known as a “disallowed cost” (applicable to incurred
cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                      15


4.5. Computation. Auditors compute estimated monetary benefits from the most reasonable data avail-
able. Actual monetary benefits are often impossible or impractical to determine. Therefore, auditors base
estimates on generally accepted principles, models, or formulas. For example, AFAA auditors use the
lower limit when expressing a single amount for a statistically projected range of values.
   4.5.1. The AFAA expresses monetary benefits in terms of “current year” dollars.
       4.5.1.1. Monetary benefit computations include any appropriate offset costs.
       4.5.1.2. Offset costs include all direct or indirect costs incurred in implementing the action that
       will result in the monetary benefit.
   4.5.2. PMB can be one-time or annual. Annual benefits recur for an indefinite period of time, but
   AFAA limits computations to a 6-year period; that is, the current year plus five.

4.6. Coordination. Before issuing a draft report to an audited organization, AFAA personnel coordinate
PMB amounts of $50,000 or more with the organization responsible for the funds (for example, the appro-
priate item manager at an air logistics center) if the responsible organization differs from the audited orga-
nization. If the organization responsible for the funds is also the audited organization, AFAA coordinates
PMB with the audited organization during the normal draft report discussion period.
4.6. (AMC) The installation AFP will send audit reports containing a PMB over $50,000 to their FMA
office for validation of the PMB. The MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/A87F will report PMBs to the Air Staff
in the semiannual installation report.

4.7. Summary of Audit Results (SAR) Statement. The AFAA attaches a SAR statement to each draft
report given to management. The SAR statement explains PMB of $50,000 or more. The report will nor-
mally explain PMB amounts of less than $50,000, or management can ask for an explanation from the
auditor. The amount included in the SAR statement will agree with the amount in the report.

4.8. Management Response.
   4.8.1. Management can agree or disagree with the estimated PMB in reports of audit. However, man-
   agement should not disagree with the audit estimate solely to defer the decision until actual benefits
   materialize.
   4.8.2. Management should comment on the reasonableness of the auditor's estimate and must justify
   disagreements with evidence that supports an alternate estimate.

4.9. Reporting Potential Monetary Benefits. AFAA includes all PMB in the Semi-Annual Report to
the Congress, RCS: DD-IG(SA)1717, and the Follow-up Status Report, RCS: DD-IG(SA)1574.

                                                 Chapter 5

                                 NONAPPROPRIATED FUND AUDITS

5.1. Nonappropriated Fund Audit Requirements.
     5.1.1. HQ Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) arranges for annual financial audits of central NAF
     instrumentalities and individual NAF activities with annual revenues or expenses exceeding $7 mil-
     lion. Groups of activities, such as the installation Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Fund, are
     not subject to this audit requirement even if its revenues or expenses exceed $7 million. However,
     individual entities in an MWR Fund (installation, MAJCOM, or Air Force) with annual revenues or
     expenses exceeding $7 million must have annual financial audits. Exceptions to these audit require-
     ments must be approved by the DODIG.
     5.1.2. Annual audits are also required for highly sensitive situations, such as potential fraud or large
     public exposure. Other audits, as deemed necessary by management and the NAF audit committee
     (paragraph 5.2.), are conducted based on assessed risk and resource availability.
     5.1.3. ANG NAF activities that are properly approved, operated in accordance with ANG regulations,
     and receive no appropriated fund support need not undergo an audit by federal entities or audits con-
     tracted by those entities.

5.2. NonappropriatedFund Audit Committee. Air Force will establish and maintain an audit commit-
tee made up of senior officials independent of NAF management to oversee audits of NAF activities. The
audit committee shall establish requirements for all NAF audits and base the requirements upon the appli-
cation of risk assessments. The Auditor General of the Air Force will serve as an advisor to the audit com-
mittee, but shall not be part of the committee.

5.3. Audit Coverage of Nonappropriated Fund Activities.
     5.3.1. Public Accountant Audits. Each year, NAFs are budgeted and approved for certified public
     accountant firms to audit Air Force NAF activities. The NAF audit committee shall establish require-
     ments and identify contract deliverables for the public accountant audits and assist in monitoring the
     conduct of financial statement audits. Certified public accountant audit responsibilities are listed in
     Attachment 3, Section A3B.
     5.3.2. AFAA Audits. In addition to the public accountant audits, the AFAA performs audits of NAF
     activities. Much like the Air Force Inspector General and other appropriated fund organizations,
     AFAA is considered “oversight” and the use of AFAA is authorized to provide audit support to NAF
     activities. Moreover, audit is a necessary component of oversight to ensure Air Force resources are
     properly and efficiently used to support NAF activities. Accordingly, AFAA “oversight” audits will be
     performed without NAF reimbursement. The AFAA:
        5.3.2.1. Does not have internally or externally established NAF limits of audit coverage. The
        AFAA schedules and performs NAF audits as deemed appropriate.
        5.3.2.2. Includes Air Force-wide system and functional reviews of NAF activities in the AFAA
        annual audit plan when appropriate.
        5.3.2.3. Includes installation-level audits of NAF activities in area audit office annual audit plans,
        based on audit priorities.
AFI65-301_AMCSUP1_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                    17


       5.3.2.4. Notifies HQ AFSVA of planned audits on NAF activities to avoid duplicate audits.
       5.3.2.5. Provides copies of installation-level reports on NAF activities to the installation audit
       focal point, HQ AFSVA/SVFR, SAF/FMCEB, and the applicable MAJCOM audit focal point.
       5.3.2.6. Should be used for audits of NAF activities involving suspected fraud and other serious
       improprieties rather than public accountants.

5.4. Audits of Private Organizations. The Air Force does not provide appropriated funds, NAFs, or
personnel supported by these funds to audit private organizations such as museum foundations, thrift
shops, Air Force Aid Societies, scouting groups, spouses’ clubs, and auxiliaries on Air Force installations,
unless authorized by the SECAF. When indications of fraud or other improprieties exist, regardless of the
amount of revenues, the commander can request an AFAA audit to protect the Air Force's interest.

5.5. Processing Public Accountant Reports. The Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA) program
requires public accountants to issue a separate report for each audit.
5.5. (AMC) For processing purposes, the installation AFP will forward all copies of public accountant
audit (PACA) reports to the wing Nonappropriated Fund Analyst (NAFFA). The installation AFP will
send one copy of the date-stamped report to the MAJCOM AFP, HQ AMC/A87F and one copy to the HQ
AMC/NAFFA. The base-level NAFFA will ensure management comments are received, tracked, and fol-
lowed up until completion and closure. It is still the responsibility of the base level NAFFA to maintain
records for administering and closing the audit.
   5.5.1. Reporting Level. The PACA program requires public accountants to prepare and distribute
   NAF activity reports based on the terms of the contract.
       5.5.1.1. When findings and recommendations are system-wide or procedural, public accountants
       consolidate installation-level audit results and issue a report to HQ AFSVA which will work with
       the appropriate oversight board or committee to correct any deficiencies.
       5.5.1.2. Public accountants should promptly report any findings that suggest irregular conduct or
       the possibility of fraud to the Air Force Services Agency, Contract Audit Management Office (HQ
       AFSVA/SVLA), and the installation’s servicing Air Force Office of Special Investigations
       (AFOSI) detachment.
   5.5.2. Management Comments. Commanders of audited activities prepare management comments
   for each finding and recommendation in the audit report and give them to the public accountant firm
   within 35 calendar days (50 days for overseas) from the date they receive the draft audit report.
   5.5.3. Evaluation of Management Comments. In the installation-level report, public accountants
   evaluate the responsiveness and adequacy of management comments for each finding and recommen-
   dation. They state whether the actions taken or planned respond to the recommendations and if any
   alternative management actions correct the reported deficiency. When public accountants evaluate
   management comments as nonresponsive, the accountant explains why management actions are inad-
   equate. These evaluations follow each management response in the final report.
   5.5.4. Report Distribution. The contract quality assurance evaluator normally receives and distrib-
   utes the public accountant report to the following:
       5.5.4.1. Installation commander.

        5.5.4.2. Local audit focal point.
        5.5.4.3. Manager of the activity audited.
        5.5.4.4. Servicing AFAA area audit office and AFOSI detachment.
        5.5.4.5. NAF Accounting Office.
        5.5.4.6. Base liaison between FM and SV (usually the NAF Financial Analyst).
     5.5.5. Command Review. MAJCOM Services staffs review public accountant reports, advise activ-
     ity commanders on preparing management comments, suggest or direct corrective actions where nec-
     essary, and monitor implementation of corrective actions. HQ AFSVA also periodically crossfeeds
     internal control weaknesses, findings, and recommendations that public accountants identify during
     audits to Services Commanders/Division Chiefs within the Air Force.
     5.5.6. Resolution of Nonconcurrences. SAF/FM works with HQ AFSVA and the appropriate over-
     sight board or committee to resolve disagreements with findings or recommendations in public
     accountant audit reports that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM level. If SAF/FM cannot resolve the dis-
     agreements, they follow policy in AFPD 65-4. The resolution period is 6 months from the date the
     public accountant issues the report.

5.6. Processing AFAA Audit Reports. AFAA addresses, processes, and distributes reports on NAF
activities according to the requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of this instruction. AFAA reports on NAF
activities receive management follow-up attention as specified in AFPD 65-4.
