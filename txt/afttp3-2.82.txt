                                               CHAPTER 1

                                          Background
1.1 GENERAL

According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum MCM 0028-07 (Nov2007), Procedures for Deployment
Health Surveillance, “force health protection (FHP) provides the conceptual framework for optimizing force
health readiness and protecting Department of Defense (DOD) personnel from occupational and environmental
health (OEH) threats associated with deployments and military Service.” Deployment health surveillance is a
critical component of health risk management and FHP. Deployment health surveillance includes identifying and
assessing OEH threats, recognizing potential exposure pathways for deployed populations, documenting and
reporting health risk, and implementing preventive measures to reduce the health risk posed by those OEH threats.

The occupational and environmental health site assessment (OEHSA) is the key information organizing process
and report that supports OEH risk management activities on military installations in an operational environment.
The OEHSA documents environmental conditions, identifies potential OEH threats, guides OEH data collection
activities and further risk assessments, and summarizes acute or immediate risk mitigation actions. Health risk
assessment (HRA) and health risk management are critical parts of deployment health surveillance. The OEHSA
is the first step of the process that supports data collection and risk assessments over time. HRAs anticipate,
identify, prioritize, and assess health threats and compare residual risks across potential controls and
countermeasures. OEHSAs are a key element of the HRA process and assist Service preventive medicine
personnel to adequately support FHP and local commanders’ risk management decisions concerning OEH threats.

1.2 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT

An OEHSA is an iterative process used to identify and provide recommendations to manage OEH threats and
their sources at a particular deployment site (e.g., base camp, airbase, forward operating base (FOB)) with
complete or potentially complete exposure pathways to a current or future deployed population. The OEHSA is a
comprehensive baseline assessment followed by periodic reassessments. The OEHSA and subsequent
reassessments are documented in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System
(DOEHRS). The Joint Service (JS) OEHSA template (see appendix A) is a tool to help collect OEHSA data.
Reassessments serve to validate complete and potentially complete exposure pathways previously recognized and
identify new sources and exposure pathways resulting from site expansion, mission change, etc. Each iteration of
the OEHSA is a snapshot in time of the current status of the site and provides the key operational tool for Service
preventive medicine personnel to prioritize and manage all OEH threat assessments and to guide allocation of on-
site preventive medicine resources.

The source is a point or non-point origin of a health threat (e.g., field of buried drums, burn pit, bulk chemical
storage, incinerator, radio frequency emitters, fugitive emission from off-site industries, on-site sanding/painting
operations, transportation route). The more specific the source information the Service preventive medicine
personnel provides, the better.

In the timeframe between these iterative OEHSA reports, personnel collecting any occupational or environmental
samples should always document (on the field data sheet and in the DOEHRS wherever possible) the rationale for
the type and location of a sample as it relates to the conceptual site model (CSM) noted in the most current
OEHSA. If the samples are for a new exposure pathway, this information should be used to update the next
OEHSA.




                                                         1-1                                              APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


The OEHSA takes time to fully develop. Service preventive medicine personnel should initiate the OEHSA as
early as possible to meet FHP mandates. The goal is for the OEHSA to be initiated at a site before it is occupied
by United States (U.S.) forces as a part of a preliminary hazard assessment (PLHA); however, operational
requirements may dictate otherwise. For all permanent and semi-permanent sites (those open for more than 30
days) the initial OEHSA will be initiated within 30 days and the first iteration completed within 90 days
(MCM 0028-07).

1.3 CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL

The cornerstone of the OEHSA is the CSM. The CSM concisely describes what is known about a site, how the
site may lead to OEH exposures, and the data gaps that must be filled to support informed health risk management
decisions. As such, the CSM guides all environmental sampling for the site and provides the contextual
information necessary for interpreting sampling data and using it in subsequent risk assessments. Finally, the
CSM serves as a communication tool between successive Service preventive medicine personnel by defining the
basis for sample collection and keeping them focused on data needs.

1.4 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT APPROACH

The iterative nature of the OEHSA process requires a multi-phase approach to fully assess all OEH threats,
develop the CSM, and facilitate health risk assessment. Figure 1-1 outlines a phased approach to complete and
continually update the OEHSA as new data are ascertained in the later phases of the process. Each phase and its
respective steps will be described in detail in subsequent chapters of this document.

This phased approach highlights how the CSM is developed and refined throughout the entire OEHSA process.
Figure 1-2 is a graphical representation of the CSM evolution. At the conclusion of Phase II of the OEHSA
process, Service preventive medicine personnel will create a CSM for all complete and potentially complete
exposure pathways.

1.5 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES

Although the OEHSA process remains constant, the specific activities or the tactical execution in support of that
process may change depending on the mission and location associated with the OEHSA. For example, if the location
is a bare site (i.e., without existing infrastructure or U.S. forces present) intended for establishing a FOB, Service
preventive medicine personnel are more apt to focus on identifying only the existing OEH threats in order to provide
the chain of command site layout recommendations that are intended to minimize future OEH health risks (e.g.,
preventing tent city build-up adjacent to a landfill) when the site is established. Any sampling taken during this
scenario would be for source identification only, in order to characterize the site based on existing OEH threats.
Figure 1-3 provides a summary of specific OEHSA activities that should be performed during phases I and II of the
OEHSA process. Completion of Phase II and entering the OEHSA in the DOEHRS fulfills the commander’s
requirement for completing the OEHSA. Further characterization of exposure pathways by environmental and/or
personal sampling in Phase III supports risk assessment/management and future deployment site reassessment
during Phase IV.

              Occupational and Environmental
              Health Site Assessment Phase I:
                 Predeployment Activities
2.1 GENERAL

The purpose of Phase I of the OEHSA process is for Service preventive medicine personnel to identify as much
information as possible concerning potential OEH threats associated with the military deployment location before
arrival on site. During these predeployment activities, Service preventive medicine personnel should begin
completing the JS OEHSA template, developing a preliminary CSM, and formulating a PLHA and courses of
action to take upon arrival at the deployed location.

2.2 PREDEPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES

The primary objective of the predeployment activities is to conduct a PLHA and build a preliminary CSM for the
deployment site. Service preventive medicine personnel should make a substantial effort to identify as many of
the potential OEH threats associated with on- and off-site sources prior to deploying to a location. This is the
beginning of the OEHSA process and the initial stages of building a CSM. It can be reasonably expected that
existing OEH information may be limited, depending on current or past operations conducted at the location.
However, an extensive search to obtain general information concerning the location should be accomplished. The
list provided below identifies some typical questions that Service preventive medicine personnel should a to
answer during predeployment activities. The amount of lead time available prior to the deployment will largely
affect the amount of information that can be obtained. During this process, the JS OEHSA template should be
used as a guide to collect information. Appendix A provides a brief description of the data captured on the JS
OEHSA template. Keep in mind that available information may be descriptive of the country or region only and
not specific to the deployed site itself. Nevertheless, Service preventive medicine personnel should make an effort
to complete as much of the JS OEHSA template as possible during this phase.

   1. Are there U.S. personnel already present at the deployed location? How many? (If there are no personnel
      currently on-site, the scope of the OEHSA will change to identifying any OEH threat sources at the site
      and allow Service preventive medicine personnel to make recommendations concerning site layout to
      minimize exposure potential to existing OEH threats.)

   2. What is the primary mission of the site? (Provide insight into the following: weapon systems present or
      planned, industrial workplaces present or planned, and OEH threats associated with these operations.)

   3. What are the primary activities performed on the location? Will there be specific at risk populations as a
      result of these activities?

   4. What types of geography, topography, and/or meteorological conditions are associated with the site
      (urban/rural area, temperature range, predominant wind direction, etc.)?

   5. What are the agricultural or industrial operations adjacent to the site? (Obtain information on typical OEH
      threats from these operations and confirm appropriate screening capability on-site.)

   6. What types of structures are on the site (temporary/permanent structures, types of housing, etc.)?

NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


      7. How will these structures be used during the current mission? What were the prior uses of these structures?
         Are intended uses compatible with prior uses?
      8. What is the historical use of the land prior to current site development and use? (Provides insight to
         possible soil contamination; e.g., agricultural, industrial.)
      9. Are there other water sources (above/below ground) on or near the site that may be utilized for purposes
         other than drinking water, i.e., sewage lagoons, cooling ponds for industrial uses, irrigation ditches, live
         stock watering holes, etc.? Are there potential health hazards associated with those water sources, i.e.,
         agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, animal/human waste, industrial discharges into the
         water source that may contain heavy metals, etc.? What are the drinking water sources? How is the
         distribution system set-up? (Identify typical drinking water sources and possible health risks to common
         water contaminants in country.)
     10. What is the security posture of the environment near the location? (An environment with active
         insurgents/terrorists could increase the likelihood of drinking water contamination and/or toxic industrial
         chemical release.)
Information sources. Since the most useful information may be reachable only on classified networks, the first
step is to locate a SIPRNET at the home station, submit a visit request and begin research of the deployed
location. Ask for guidance on applicable SIPRNET Web addresses from the appropriate Service component
surgeon’s office or the combatant commander for the deployed site.

Service preventive medicine personnel should contact the following organizations during their predeployment
research and provide them sufficient lead time to effectively respond to the request:

National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI)1

NMCI and GTAP maintain medical intelligence information on countries around the world that may include
disease and environmental health (EH) risks, current industries in the surrounding area, and details on land
utilization which may support the area of interest. GTAP also incorporates any historical knowledge/data about a
specific location and provides recommendations. This information will help identify sources of OEH threats,
which can be researched through traditional means (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), UNEP,
IAEA, Patty’s Toxicology, Toxicology Data Network, Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders,
etc.). There are numerous references that refer to the medical, environmental, disease, intelligence, and
countermeasures (MEDIC) compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) as a potential source of information.

    The Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC) was formally re-designated as the National Center for Medical Intelligence
    (NCMI) in July 2008.


APR 2012                                                          2-2

However, the MEDIC CD-ROM no longer exists. All information that was on the MEDIC CD-ROM is now
available on the NCMI Web site. Typical data available from NCMI and GTAP includes:

      1. maps, topographic and geological information relevant to the deployment area

      2. historical and current property use of the site such as the type of agricultural, industrial, institutional,
         commercial, and/or residential uses

      3. known hazardous waste sites

      4. known contamination and pollution in air, water, and soil media

      5. typical climate conditions including normal and extreme temperatures, seasonal precipitation, and seasonal
         prevailing wind directions and velocities

      6. known property use including type of infrastructure such as existing buildings, transportation networks,
         water treatment and distribution systems, wastewater collection and treatment systems, and known power
         generation and transmission systems.

Other potential sources of OEH threat information concerning deployed locations are the MESL at
https://mesl.apgea.army.mil/mesl/, the classified Occupational and Environmental Health Surveillance (OEHS)
data portal at https://doehsportal.csd.disa.smil.mil/doehrs-oehs/, and the Defense Occupational and Environmental
Health Readiness System at https://doehrs-ih.csd.disa.mil/. These portals allow Service preventive medicine
personnel the ability to search, view, and download classified or unclassified OEHS documents and exposure
summaries from various deployed locations. In addition, a library of Phase I assessments completed by the
USAPHC, OEHSAs, and POEMSs are located at https://phc.army.smil.mil via the SIPRNET.

The following centers may provide additional OEH threat data based on the sources identified from NCMI or

Below are additional sources of information that may be obtained from one of the organizations above or through
the Service combatant command (COCOM) Surgeons office.

EOHWED summaries and/or POEMSs4 data: These documents are environmental exposure data summaries
created for a deployment location, for a specified time period, normally 6 months or 1 year. These reports provide
the potential OEH exposures to deployed personnel at a particular deployment location for a specified period of
time.

Occupational and environmental health exposure document (OEHED): OEHEDs contain deployed exposure
summaries for each industrial workplace or similar exposure group to include the type of workplace and the
associated occupational health (OH) exposures at the deployed location. These documents identify the industrial
shops located at a particular deployment location, as well as, OH exposure documentation.

Environmental baseline studies (EBSs) provide an excellent source of background and land use data to help
Service preventive medicine personnel identify potential OEH threat sources. The EBS determines the potential
for present and past site contamination by hazardous substances, petroleum products, and derivatives, as well as,
contaminants (e.g., lead, copper, and pesticides (above and below ground)) in drinking water, asbestos-containing
materials, PCBs, radioactive material, or lead-based paint. An EBS should have been done initially for all sites.

After action reports document what was accomplished by the predecessor, lessons learned, and potential OEH
threat issues that need to be addressed by the next rotation of Service preventive medicine personnel.

Google Earth and similar open source satellite mapping tools contain surprisingly accurate overhead visual
layouts of most geographic areas. These mapping tools can aid in identifying potential sources of EH threats
(e.g., large industry, major emission sources, lakes, lagoons) surrounding the deployed site. Figure 2-1 provides
an example of a Google Earth visual layout of Balad Air Base, Iraq. The program has a more refined resolution as

you zoom in to an area of the base. This image gives Service preventive medicine personnel a visual of the base
before arrival, allowing the assessor to start formulating a site reconnaissance approach. In addition, the AIPH
GTAP can produce geographic information system-based maps upon request.

Data on the prevailing wind is another critical piece of information that Service preventive medicine personnel
need to aid in identifying potential exposure pathways. Wind direction and speed play a pivotal role in the
migration of OEH threats. Information on prevailing winds can be obtained from NCMI, the internet, or local
weather sources (e.g., the supporting meteorological detachment or weather squadron). A wind rose shows how
wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular site. Presented in a circular format, as in
figure 2-2, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from a particular direction. The wind rose may
not be available for every military deployment location. In which case, Service preventive medicine personnel
may use wind information from a nearby airfield or airport as representative data for the site. However, the greater
the distance this information source is from the site, the less accurate it may be in representing site-specific
characteristics.

Service preventive medicine personnel should begin completing the JS OEHSA template with information
acquired through research of the sources listed earlier in chapter 2. The extent of the research will be directly
related to the amount of lead time available prior to the deployment. The development of a preliminary CSM is
the typical deliverable associated with predeployment activities. Based on the information found, Service
preventive medicine personnel should begin to formulate a PLHA and courses of action needed soon after arrival
at the deployed location, such as prioritizing site reconnaissance and interviews to address the more important
OEH threats first (e.g., specific threat or source located upwind of cantonment areas). Typically, there is not
enough information or confidence in the information to draw specific health risk conclusions during this phase to
present to a commander. More information likely will have to be collected during the next phase of the OEHSA
process.

              Occupational and Environmental
              Health Site Assessment Phase II:
                   Deployment Activities
3.1 GENERAL

During this phase of the OEHSA process, Service preventive medicine personnel will build upon the information
(e.g., preliminary CSM and PLHA) ascertained from Phase I by performing interviews, site reconnaissance, and
pathway screenings using direct reading instruments and/or professional judgment. Furthermore, Service
preventive medicine personnel will perform qualitative risk ranking on complete and potentially complete
exposure pathways, build the consolidated CSM, and produce the OEHSA report for the site. The completion of
Phase II meets MCM 0028-07 and Department of Defense instruction (DODI) 6490.03 requirements for an
OEHSA.

Immediately upon arrival at the deployed location, the lead Service preventive medicine person should engage
with the local commander or chain of command on the following:

   1. OEHSA requirements and procedures

   2. Planned activities and support needed

      a. Site reconnaissance/interviews on- and off-site

      b. Areas to visit

   3. Pre-identified OEH threat sources (based on data from predeployment activities)

   4. OEHSA timelines:

      a. Out-brief of visit to include immediate recommendations

      b. Development of the CSM and initiate sampling activities

      c. OEHSA report.

Service preventive medicine personnel should continuously communicate with the chain of command throughout
the OEHSA process on findings and potential health risks as they are identified. Upon completion of Phase II, an
OEHSA report can be generated from data obtained and validated during site reconnaissance and interviews, and
site/pathway screening using direct reading instruments and/or professional judgment. An example OEHSA report
is provided in appendix B.

3.2 SITE INTERVIEWS AND RECONNAISSANCE

Site interviews and reconnaissance will allow Service preventive medicine personnel to: identify/validate OEH
threats on the deployment location, identify potential exposure pathways of a particular source, and determine if
exposure pathways are complete via pathway screening. The primary objective of interviews and reconnaissance

                                                       3-1                                             APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


is to identify and visually verify the existing occupational and environmental conditions at the site that could
negatively impact the health of personnel. Site reconnaissance and interviews allow Service preventive medicine
personnel to cultivate what was learned in Phase I, generate more detailed information, and identify other
potential sources of OEH threats.

OEHSA information and data can become classified. Service preventive medicine personnel must be aware of what
data or information can cause the OEHSA to become classified (e.g., vulnerabilities, recording grid coordinates,
including maps of the site, and photographs of potential high interest facilities). Service preventive medicine
personnel should consult with appropriate agencies and follow Service specific guidance and procedures for
classification and distribution.

3.2.1 On-Site/Off-Site Interviews

Service preventive medicine personnel should conduct interviews with personnel who are familiar with the
deployed location and its historical land use. Interviews are necessary to obtain site information that may not have
been previously available and/or to validate previously collected information identified in the JS OEHSA
template. Interviews should be conducted before reconnaissance, and can be continued during and after
reconnaissance to clarify information on potential sources of OEH threats. Credible, knowledgeable individuals
may be on hand for established locations; however, these individuals may not be readily available for a site
without existing infrastructure. Figure 3-1 lists organizations/personnel from which Service preventive medicine
personnel can gain valuable information required to complete the JS OEHSA template.

Interviews with host nation liaisons may provide a wealth of information pertaining to local or surrounding
industries or sources of OEH threats at the site, and may provide insight on historical land use.

3.2.2 On-Site/Off-Site Reconnaissance

Service preventive medicine personnel should request that personnel who have historical knowledge of the site
and other subject matter experts from the organizations providing base operating support (see figure 3-1)
participate in the on-site reconnaissance. The major objectives of reconnaissance are to identify and verify
existing occupational and environmental conditions at the site or adjacent to the site that could impact the health
of personnel. Furthermore, Service preventive medicine personnel should be on the lookout for industrial
operations that are conducted “inside and “outside the wire” of the deployed site. If, in the professional judgment
of the lead preventive medicine professional, the OEH threats associated with these operations may pose an
immediate health threat, actions should be taken to preclude or avoid major OEH exposures.

One of the first steps to site reconnaissance is to obtain a current map of the area (e.g., aerial or satellite
photographs), if one is available. Obtaining on-site and off-site maps to support site reconnaissance is vital.
Photographs also provide excellent documentation. Obtain approval prior to taking photographs and OEH
samples, if necessary, and be careful not to include photographs that may change the classification of the OEHSA.
All photographs must have a good description depicting the context of the photo (e.g., this picture depicts the burn
pit from the closest occupied work center, 250 meters SSW of the pit). When conducting reconnaissance, Service
preventive medicine personnel should focus on potential OEH threats identified in the preliminary CSM,
cantonment areas, and/or primary work locations. However, the site reconnaissance should span every area of the
site and around the site “outside the wire” in order to identify additional OEH threat sources. Service preventive
medicine personnel should consider using direct reading instruments (DRIs) while performing reconnaissance on
and off site to identify any unknown OEH threats (e.g., alarming radiation dosimeters for potential radiation
sources, sound level meter, multi-gas detectors, etc.). As part of the site reconnaissance, all buildings and
industrial areas should be systematically visited.

Service preventive medicine personnel shall drive or walk the inside perimeter of the site to identify the
boundaries of the site, recording the military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates for the corners, and
estimating the total area occupied by the site. The site reconnaissance must be extensive enough to identify all
outfalls or potential incoming sources of pollution that may affect personnel living and working on the site. The
list below outlines some key items, areas, and hazard sources that Service preventive medicine personnel must
look for and describe during site reconnaissance. The majority of these are covered in the JS OEHSA template.

   1. Building’s exterior/interior conditions

   2. Storage tanks

   3. Pits, ponds, or lagoons

   4. Current use (adjacent properties)

   5. Pools of liquid

   6. Stained soil

   7. Geologic, hydrologic, topographic

   8. Drums

   9. Stressed vegetation

  10. Type of roads

  11. Unidentified containers

  12. Ambient air conditions

Site perimeter reconnaissance provides an opportunity to identify potential off-site industrial operations that could
impact site operations. Service preventive medicine personnel will need to overcome the traditionally challenging
task of identifying significant off-site industrial operations that may pose a potential health threat to site personnel.
As a minimum, any major industrial operations within five miles should be identified on the JS OEHSA template.
Service preventive medicine personnel should follow any Service specific guidance that dictates otherwise.
Depending on force protection conditions, restrictions may prohibit traveling “outside the wire” to conduct
interviews and reconnaissance. If this is the case, an interview with other agencies that regularly travel outside the
site (e.g., security forces personnel) may provide information on significant off-site sources and threats. Aerial
reconnaissance also would be a method of identifying OEH threat sources within the five mile radius around the site.

Site reconnaissance includes entering/describing existing buildings/structures and identifying all key on-site
industrial operations (e.g., maintenance and transportation), existing controls, and the frequency/duration these
operations are performed. Industrial shops and potentially hazardous processes should be added to the JS OEHSA
template if not already documented and tracked in the DOEHRS-industrial hygiene. Service preventive medicine
personnel should observe all higher risk operations or processes to determine whether or not these processes have
the potential to affect another population outside the work center.

In the case of bare site operations when no pre-existing infrastructure is present, complete an initial site
reconnaissance prior to determining the site layout. If the OEHSA represents the first preventive medicine team
visit to the site, responsibilities may include recommending ideal cantonment and work locations for the site to
eliminate or mitigate potential exposure pathways. Temporary locations for sleeping and eating quarters, work
locations, etc., may need to be quickly identified with the understanding that relocation may be necessary based
on OEHSA findings and associated HRAs. In this situation, coordination should be made to reassess the site once
the camp is established, preferably within 30 days, in order to determine additional potential exposure pathways
relevant to site configuration and operations.

The collection of site OEH threat data through site interviews and reconnaissance facilitates the completion of the
JS OEHSA template. Service preventive medicine personnel must identify all complete or potentially complete
exposure pathways for known OEH threats. Determining whether exposure pathways are complete is
accomplished to the extent practical through direct observation of operations (professional judgment) and
pathway screening with direct reading/field portable analytical instruments.

3.3 PATHWAY SCREENING

The primary objective of pathway screening is to answer the question, “Is the exposure pathway complete or
not?” A secondary objective is to identify exposure pathways that may become complete at some future point in
time and under what conditions this could occur. Service preventive medicine personnel apply qualitative and
quantitative measures to answer these questions. Pathway screening, within the limitations of available equipment
and/or knowledge of specific on- and off-site industrial processes, can confirm which exposure pathways are
complete and must be added to the final CSM. Site interviews and reconnaissance, screening potential exposure
points with DRIs, and estimating the preliminary health risk can be accomplished simultaneously for each
exposure pathway. However, time constraints and equipment availability may limit the ability of the Service
preventive medicine personnel to confirm pathway completion or to investigate all exposure points (or locations).
Service preventive medicine personnel must ensure exposure pathways and exposure point locations that have not
been evaluated for completion are added to the final CSM to drive further data collection.

The results of the pathway screening supports initial prioritization of follow-on, more in-depth sampling and
analysis activities in support of developing a health risk assessment. Furthermore, pathway screening results will
enable Service preventive medicine personnel to perform a qualitative risk ranking to determine if immediate


                                                          3-5                                                APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


protective actions are needed and to address any immediate operational risks associated with the OEH threats
(e.g., site layout recommendations) for the site.

During pathway screening, if a direct reading instrument measurement is “high” (defined as a concentration above
a pre-specified level; e.g., the lowest short-term negligible military exposure guideline (MEG)) at a known
exposure point, immediate actions should be taken to initially control the exposure (e.g., move the PAR/source,
suspend the process, implement administrative controls, provide personal protective equipment).

Direct reading instruments are the most definitive method, but other methods (physical evidence, interviews, etc.)
are just as valuable and should be used to refine which DRIs to use. Before taking direct readings, preventive
medicine personnel have to determine if the source, pathway, and receptor are all present or potentially present.
Relying on initial findings in a Phase I CSM/ PHLA may lead to unnecessary sampling or misleading results (e.g.,
sampling a well that is no longer used as a water source). Finally, professional judgment is critical to ensuring
DRIs are used correctly (e.g., don’t select a DRI with a limit of detection in the parts per million (ppm) range
when the chemical of concern’s (COC) health threshold is in parts per billion (ppb)). Figure 3-2 outlines the
decision logic for pathway screening using direct reading instruments. The “Basic Characterization” in figure 3-2
will be addressed later in section 4-2 and figure 4-1.

The ability to confirm pathway completion in the field is largely dictated by each Service’s field analytical
capability. This capability is dependent upon screening equipment, training, analytical methods, the
environmental media, and interferences and the site’s environmental conditions. It is critical that Service
preventive medicine personnel be able to discern and communicate the goals, application, and inherent limitations
of pathway screening. Service preventive medicine personnel should choose a conservative approach to ensure
pathway screening is biased to achieve a high probability of detection (e.g., worst case scenario). Poor pathway
screening could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the exposure pathway. This, in turn, could result in
unacceptable exposures to site personnel and/or have a negative impact on mission accomplishment.
In the absence of existing infrastructure, the initial preventive medicine team should focus on existing sources for
OEH threats to facilitate permanent site layout and build-up. Usually during this particular scenario, the primary
PAR consists of advanced echelon and construction teams. If direct reading instruments are available, pathway
screening results should be used to drive preferred cantonment and work locations for the site to eliminate or
mitigate potentially complete exposure pathways.

Pathway screening results and conclusions should be documented in the appropriate section of the JS OEHSA
template. If direct reading instruments are used, pathway screening must be documented as follows:

   1. OEH threat source

   2. Sample date and time

   3. Location sampled (e.g., MGRS coordinates and site sketch)

   4. Media sampled

   5. Analytes

   6. Screening results, including units of measurement

   7. Instrumentation used, calibration records, serial number, and results

   8. Environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, humidity, etc.).

Any exposure pathways that are considered incomplete by either pathway screening or professional judgment
may be excluded from the CSM. The rationale and method of determining that an exposure pathway is incomplete
also must be documented in the appropriate section of the JS OEHSA template. As mentioned previously, site
reconnaissance and interviews, pathway screening, and estimating the preliminary health risk will likely be
accomplished simultaneously. However, deployment time constraints and equipment availability may limit the
ability of Service preventive medicine personnel to perform pathway screening on all potentially complete
exposure pathways. Service preventive medicine personnel must address in the consolidated CSM all potentially
complete exposure pathways that have not been ruled out. Exposure pathways that have been deemed complete or
potentially complete are used to build the OEH SAP, addressed in chapter 4.

3.4 BUILD CONSOLIDATED CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL

Service preventive medicine personnel must consolidate all exposure pathways identified in the JS OEHSA
template that are determined to be complete or potentially complete to build the CSM. Specific exposure
pathways, (e.g., source, environmental medium, health threat, route of exposure, and population affected), and
additional information such as existing controls and frequency/duration must be included in the CSM. Figure 3-3
provides an example of a CSM showing four notional exposure pathways. Each row represents a single, distinct
exposure pathway. The column on the right represents the residual risk after existing control measures.




                                                        3-7                                              APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


Preventive medicine personnel accomplish qualitative risk ranking of complete exposure pathways based on the
information gathered during site reconnaissance and pathway screening (e.g., discolored soil, visible smoke cloud,
and elevated pathway screening results). Service preventive medicine personnel will estimate risk using the
guidance in figure 3-4 to determine severity and probability and the risk assessment matrix in figure 3-5 to
prioritize exposure pathways for further evaluation. Figure 3-4 provides Service preventive medicine personnel
general guidance on assigning the appropriate severity and probability for an exposure pathway. This guidance is
based on risk assessment principles described in DODI 6055.1 (Aug1998), DOD Safety and Occupational Health
(SOH) Program.

The key to using the risk management matrix guidance is to have a consistent and separate approach to
probability and severity. Probability and severity help determine exposure pathway priority. The risk management

process is the best method to quickly prioritize the exposure pathways on the CSM. This information should be
provided to the local chain of command. Since OEH risk management is an iterative process, this facilitates the
decision makers’ ability to prioritize health risk evaluations and control options. The qualitative risk ranking using
the risk management process is a tool for Service preventive medicine personnel to assist with deciding which
exposure pathways should be assessed first. This prioritization will help focus resources to evaluate higher risk
OEH threats that have an immediate impact on the operational mission or the health of site personnel. Other
factors may affect the prioritization such as operational risks, cantonment area location determination, and
equipment availability.

3.5 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT REPORT

By fully completing the JS OEHSA template during Phase II of the OEHSA process, Service preventive medicine
personnel will capture all the necessary data to develop the OEHSA report. Development of the report is largely
impacted by whether or not Service preventive medicine personnel have access to the DOEHRS or not. The
following URL provides directions and links for obtaining a DOEHRS account: http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/
envirohealth/hrasm/Pages/DOEHRS_Information.aspx or https://doehrs-ih.csd.disa.mil/Doehrs. No classified
OEHSA information or data should be entered into the DOEHRS. Any information that could cause an OEHSA
report to be classified should be submitted separately via the classified OEHS data portal at
https://mesl.csd.disa.smil.mil/mesl or follow Service specific guidance on reporting and distribution of classified
OEHSA data.

3.5.1 Service Preventive Medicine Personnel with Access to Defense Occupational and
      Environmental Health Readiness System

Service preventive medicine personnel shall input all the data captured with the JS OEHSA template into the
DOEHRS OEHSA. Once all the data are entered into the DOEHRS, the DOEHRS OEHSA report should be
reviewed and approved by the OEHSA approving official. The OEHSA approving official should be the senior
on-site preventive medicine professional or a higher echelon preventive medicine professional designated by the
joint task force (JTF) or Service component theater policies, such as the Command Surgeon’s FHP officer. Once
the DOEHRS OEHSA report is approved, all data entered into the DOEHRS OEHSA report and all
samples/surveys/reports attached to the survey, will become a time-specific permanent record. The DOEHRS
OEHSA report can then be generated (hardcopy or electronically) from the DOEHRS.

3.5.2 Service Preventive Medicine Personnel without Access to Defense Occupational and
      Environmental Health Readiness System

Service preventive medicine personnel without DOEHRS access will have to generate the OEHSA report
manually. The completed JS OEHSA template will be the primary OEHSA information used to generate the
report. Contact the appropriate Service’s OEH surveillance center (i.e., AIPH, NMCPHC, or USAFSAM) for
assistance. Service preventive medicine personnel must ensure the report includes the following: an executive
summary identifying significant OEH threats that have potential to affect one or more populations living/working
on-site; the operational mission and recommended courses of action; a prioritized consolidated CSM; a
preliminary hazard assessment based on qualitative risk ranking for each complete or potentially complete

exposure pathway; any limitations of the assessment due to time and operational mission constraints; and a
summary of results of pathway screening that may have been accomplished. The report should be reviewed and
approved by a senior preventive medicine professional on-site or a higher echelon preventive medicine
professional designated by the JTF or Service component theater policies, such as the command surgeon’s FHP
officer.

3.5.3 Peer Review

Before submitting the OEHSA report through the chain of command, Service preventive medicine personnel
should seek a peer review of the report through technical channels from Service preventive medicine personnel on
the JTF and Service component Command Surgeon staff. Once approved, the OEHSA report must be routed to
the deployment site medical authority and local operational commander. Furthermore, the OEHSA report should
be sent to the JTF Surgeon and COCOM Surgeon in accordance with theater policies and DODI 6490.03,
Table E4.T4. If the OEHSA was not entered directly into the DOEHRS, submit the peer-reviewed OEHSA report
to the MESL and notify the appropriate Service’s deployed OEH surveillance center (i.e., AIPH, NMCPHC, or
USAFSAM). Submit the OEHSA report to the MESL by sending it to oehs.data@us.army.mil or
oehs@usachppm.army.smil.mil depending on its classification.

Upon completion of the OEHSA report, the requirement for conducting an initial OEHSA at a particular site per
MCM 0028-07 and DODI 6490.03, Table E4.T2 has been met.

             Occupational and Environmental
             Health Site Assessment Phase III:
                Additional Data Collection
4.1 GENERAL

The iterative nature of the OEHSA process may require multi-phased, multi-deployment, or multi-year evaluation
periods to thoroughly assess all OEH threats and to fully characterize health risks. The primary objective of this
phase is to collect environmental data to accurately characterize health risks associated with the OEH threats
identified in the previous phases, update the current CSM as new data and hazards are identified, establish long
term sampling plans, and continually support health risk management for the particular deployment location and
time. The initial Service preventive medicine personnel should develop a comprehensive site OEH SAP to
address the final CSM. Follow-on Service preventive medicine assets will validate the original CSM, look for
new exposure pathways, build upon the data collected, continue to execute the site OEH SAP, and file a revised
OEHSA report. This process should be repeated at least annually or sooner if information about the particular site
indicates a significant change in mission or population or concerns about specific OEH threats emerge.

4.2 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SAMPLING

For Service preventive medicine personnel to be able to characterize health risks associated with exposure
pathways, they must build and execute a comprehensive, defensible site OEH SAP. The site OEH SAP is a
consolidation of individual exposure pathway sampling strategies. Service preventive medicine personnel should
develop a sampling strategy for each complete or potentially complete exposure pathway on the CSM and
incorporate the strategy into the OEH SAP. The objective of the sampling is to obtain the right type, quality, and
quantity of sampling data to characterize OEH risks.

Service preventive medicine personnel must develop a defensible OEH SAP to properly characterize potential
exposures to OEH threats for the various sub-populations at a site to support health risk assessment. Furthermore,
personal sampling accomplished as part of the OEH SAP supports the longitudinal exposure record for the
individual sampled. The level of detail in the OEH SAP will depend on the nature of the deployment site and
mission (e.g., site source identification for bare site operations versus fully operational sites with multiple
populations that are at risk of exposure). The OEH SAP should be dynamic and evolve as new data are
ascertained and as the deployment mission evolves. It is critical that the OEH SAP capture all sampling and
analytical procedures to be performed for each complete or potentially complete exposure pathway identified on
the CSM. OEH sampling will most likely be performed across multiple deployment phases, by multiple
preventive medicine assets, for a year or more to fully characterize exposure point concentrations for OEH threats.
For continuity purposes, the OEH SAP must describe all sampling activities and include the following
information, at a minimum, for each exposure pathway identified in the CSM:

   1. Media to be sampled (air, soil, water, food, disease vectors)
   2. Sampling approach (judgment, systematic random, etc.)

   3. Number of samples

   4. Type of samples (discrete, composite, environmental, personal, quality assurance [duplicate, blank]
      background, etc.) and the underlying assumptions that justify the sample type


                                                        4-1                                             APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


   5. Sampling locations and an explanation why/how those locations were selected and what potentially each
      location represents (e.g., exposure point, background) (indicate locations on a map, site sketch, MGRS
      coordinates, etc.)

   6. Duration of sampling and interval between samples (if multiple) with explanation of why duration and
      interval were chosen

   7. Analytical methodologies (field analytical tools versus reach-back laboratory analysis) and target analytes

   8. Sampling equipment (including capabilities and limitations of equipment)

   9. Sample preservation techniques

  10. Equipment decontamination procedures.
Arguably, the OEH SAP is the most critical document of the OEHSA process because it bridges all information
discovered about OEH threats on the site, allowing Service preventive medicine personnel to effectively assess
the health risks associated with them. Service preventive medicine personnel should, as much as is practical, use
industry standards for developing sampling strategies such as the Department of Defense industrial hygiene
(DODIH) exposure assessment process and the EPA data quality objective (DQO) process. The sampling
strategies help Service preventive medicine personnel ensure they collect sufficient quantity and quality of the
right type of data to support health risk assessment for all populations at risk.
Conceptually, the OEHSA process fits the standard American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) exposure
assessment strategy (see figure 4-1) for both occupational and environmental exposures. The DOD has adopted a
modified version of this industry standard called the DODIH Exposure Assessment Model (see figure 4-2). This
modification adapts the AIHA strategy to conform to the military decision-making process and incorporates
language specific to DOD systems. The basic characterization of the exposure assessment strategy was completed
by accomplishing Phase I and II of the OEHSA process. The goal of the “exposure assessment” stage in the
AIHA process is to determine if the OEH risks associated with exposures are acceptable or not, or if further
information is required to be able to make that decision. Nevertheless, all exposure levels whether acceptable,
unacceptable, or uncertain must be documented accordingly.
Furthermore, the OEH sampling strategy should be based upon the principles of the DQO. The DQO process is
simple and well recognized to ensure data collection is accomplished appropriately, with reason and relevance,
and ensures the right type, quantity, and quality of data are collected for decisionmaking. The “decision” is what
drives the DQOs. The DQO process includes seven steps that define the sampling strategy (see figure 4-3). For
each complete or potentially complete exposure pathway on the CSM, Service preventive medicine personnel
should develop a sampling strategy incorporating the steps outlined in figure 4-2.

Service preventive medicine personnel will be required to make decisions as to the best sampling approach to
assess an exposure pathway. The objective is to develop the most resource-effective sampling strategy that will
provide the assessor and key decision maker with enough confidence to make health risk decisions. Performing
site reconnaissance to validate the exposure pathways on the CSM provides Service preventive medicine
personnel direct visibility on the nature of the OEH threat, inherent variability of the environmental medium and
information on the various PARs. The site OEH SAP should capture all the decision points and explain why the
approach was chosen. The environmental medium through which an OEH threat migrates to an exposure point
and the variability of the medium will drive or influence sampling methodologies, equipment, and procedures to
assess the potential OEH threat risk. The information contained in figures 4-3 through 4-5 should, as a minimum,
be included in the SAP for all samples collected.

There are numerous environmental sampling references such as AIPH (formerly USACHPPM) technical guide
(TG) 317 (Feb2009), Technical Guide for Collection of Environmental Sampling Data Related to Environmental
Health Site Assessments for Military Deployments, technical manual (TM)-preventive medicine 6490.2
(Dec2008), Technical Guide for Collection of Environmental Sampling Data Related to Environmental Health
Site Assessments for Military Deployments, the USAF Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Field Manual, and
EPA guidance that can assist Service preventive medicine personnel in developing a sound OEH SAP. When
developing an OEH SAP, the decision or the objective will drive the sampling strategy. Service preventive
medicine personnel should seek guidance either from Service preventive medicine personnel on the JTF and
Service component command surgeon staff or Service’s deployed OEH surveillance centers when developing the
OEH SAP.

When executing the OEH SAP, Service preventive medicine personnel should capture conditions associated with
the sampling event that can help build confidence in the data. Physical observations such as wind direction,
stressed vegetation, and discolored soil during the sampling event provides essential information as to whether or
not a sampling result is representative of a potential exposure. These observations and any field notes must be
captured and recorded with the sampling results and uploaded into the DOEHRS or the MESL (see chapter 5) and
reported in accordance with (IAW) the Service’s theater policies. This is critical data when assessing the potential
health risks associated with an OEH threat.

As mentioned previously, environmental/personal sampling most likely will be executed across multiple
deployments by multiple preventive medicine teams. Service preventive medicine personnel must continually
update the OEHSA report while collecting sampling data, assessing exposure results, performing health risk
assessment, and reporting OEH findings, results, and control recommendations up the chain of command. As
sampling data are collected and interpreted and confidence grows in the characterization of exposure point
concentrations, Service preventive medicine personnel should continue to update the risk-based prioritization for
the exposure pathways on the CSM to ensure preventive medicine resources are focused on higher risk OEH
threats on the site.

The primary objective of performing environmental sampling is to accurately characterize health risk to deployed
populations and when personal sampling is performed, data obtained supports documentation in that Service
members’ longitudinal exposure record. This is the goal for which Service preventive medicine personnel should
strive. Developing and executing a comprehensive site OEH SAP is an essential step for Service preventive
medicine personnel to be able to achieve this goal. The importance of performing sound OEH sampling to drive
operational decisions and support health risk assessments cannot be stressed enough. All sampling data, health
risk assessment conclusions and decisions shall be uploaded into the DOEHRS or the MESL and reported IAW
the Service’s theater polices.

             Occupational and Environmental
             Health Site Assessment Phase IV:
             Occupational And Environmental
                 Health Risk Assessment
OEH data management is ongoing throughout the OEHSA process and across multiple deployments by multiple
rotations of preventive medicine personnel. OEH data management for a particular site begins with the OEHSA
report. The first Service preventive medicine team should document the initial OEHSA in the DOEHRS and each
rotation of preventive medicine personnel thereafter should continue to update the OEHSA. As a minimum, the
OEHSA should be updated annually during which time supporting preventive medicine personnel should validate
that the existing CSM is still current, identify new exposure pathways and new OEH threat sources, categorize
pathways that have been fully characterized as “no further action required” and exclude them from future updates,
continue to fill data gaps by executing the SAP and revise the SAP based on new information. As OEH sampling
and surveillance data are obtained and interpreted, Service preventive medicine personnel must continually
communicate health risk information to local commanders, command surgeons, health care providers, and
military personnel. This information should include results from HRAs and recommendations to mitigate health
risks using appropriate risk communication language that is consistent with the confidence level of the data.

As Service preventive medicine personnel continually collect data and perform HRAs at a deployed location, any
occupational and environmental monitoring and sampling results and health risk assessments must be documented
in accordance with the Service theater policies. Any information that has not been uploaded into the DOEHRS
must be submitted via the MESL, https://mesl.apgea.army.mil/mesl/.

The MESL is an online repository administered by the USAPHC for archiving and providing access to deployed
OEH surveillance data. It is not a part of the DOEHRS and does not interface with the DOEHRS. Service preventive
medicine personnel without access to the DOEHRS should upload all OEH surveillance and health risk
documentation for their deployed location. All the OEH surveillance and risk documentation for a deployed location
should be reviewed by the JTF or Service component FHP officer to build the POEMS for their deployed location in
the MESL. This is usually conducted with assistance from the Service’s deployed OEH surveillance centers (i.e.,
AIPH, NMCPHC, and USAFSAM) by reviewing the data in the DOEHRS and/or the MESL.

The POEMSs are the official DOD-approved documents that summarize population health risks and the potential
medical implications associated with major deployment sites (e.g., base camps). Specifically, POEMSs describe the
types of potential health threats (e.g., airborne pollutants, water pollutants, infectious disease, noise, heat/cold),
summarize data/information collected, and provide an assessment of the significance of any known or potential
short-term (during deployment) and long-term (post deployment) health risk to the population deployed to the site.




                                                         5-1                                               APR 2012
NTRP 4-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.82_IP /ATP 4-02.82


The POEMSs are developed to address the requirements of DODI 6490.03 and 6055.05 (Nov 2008),
Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), and MCM 0028-07. The POEMS replaces the requirement to
prepare “periodic occupational and environmental monitoring summaries on an standard form (SF) 600 for each
permanent or semi-permanent basing location.” POEMSs are to be created and validated/updated for every major
deployment site as soon as sufficient data are available, but no later than one year after the site is established. In
general, POEMSs should reflect data and information collected over a year or more in order to adequately
evaluate potential risks from long-term exposures at a site. Specifically, POEMSs are the results of the OEHSA
process and limited by the OEH SAP developed to characterize each exposure pathway identified in the
consolidated CSM. POEMSs should be reevaluated as data indicate exposure conditions have changed.
Appendix D contains an example POEMS.

To ensure the POEMSs are true representations of a deployed location’s OEH conditions and health risks for a
specific site, Service preventive medicine personnel must continue to execute the comprehensive OEH SAP,
document health risk assessments, and update the OEHSA information in the DOEHRS (or upload the
information into the MESL if the DOEHRS access is not available) during their deployment.

The OEHSA provides a comprehensive assessment of both occupational and environmental health threats
associated with a deployment location (e.g., permanent or semi-permanent site location) and the activities and
missions that occur there. The JS OEHSA template is the OEHSA data/information collection tool used to
identify all OEH threats and to build a comprehensive CSM for a particular deployed location. The template can

  Example Occupational and Environmental
    Health Threat Scenario and Sampling
             and Analysis Plan
B.1 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THREAT SCENARIO

A Service preventive medicine team was tasked to perform an OEHSA at a potential FOB to determine whether
or not OEH conditions at the site pose a potential health risk. There is limited infrastructure on the site. The site is
approximately 6 acres in size on mostly flat land and surrounded by a security fence. During the execution of the
OEHSA, the Service preventive medicine team identified an OEH threat source, a coal burning power plant
located upwind and 1 km west of the site, that potentially may pose an acute or chronic health risk to future site
personnel. Based on site reconnaissance and interviews, Service preventive medicine personnel have determined
that a complete exposure pathway exists for power plant emissions and that environmental sampling should be
accomplished to determine the potential health risks at the site.

B.3 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLAN

The following sampling and analysis plan was developed to support assessment of the completed exposure
pathways identified in the CSM.

Overall Sampling Objective: To measure ambient air and soil concentrations for the COCs at representative
exposure points to determine whether or not measured levels exceed applicable OEELs and pose a potential acute
and/or chronic health risk to future site personnel.

OEELs: MEGs are appropriate OEELs for the OEH threats identified in the CSM above. All sample results will
be compared to the appropriate MEGs.

B.3.1 Ambient Air: Sampling and Analytical Method(s)

Assumptions: The power plant is the only known source of pollution in the immediate area other than normal
ambient conditions. Airborne COC concentrations will be highly variable and dependent on meteorological and
atmospheric conditions. All environmental samples will be sent to USAPHC laboratory except for sulfur dioxide.
Sulfur dioxide sampling will be completed via a direct reading instrument and results recorded into the site field
data log (see figure B-2).

B.3.2 Soil: Sampling and Analytical Method(s)

Soil sampling and analytical methods for the scenario in paragraph B.1 are depicted in figure B-3.

Rationale: Monitor for 14 consecutive days to determine typical ambient air exposure concentrations
associated with the normal ambient conditions and emissions from the coal power plant.
Procedures: Place one DPS at the central location identified by the geospatial coordinates identified below and
one DPS at the boundary location identified by the geospatial coordinates identified below. Sampling at each
location will be accomplished at approximately 4 to 6 feet above ground level to account for the breathing
zone. Samplers will be placed at a distance of at least twice the height from any on-site/off-site obstruction
(buildings, trees, etc.), to mitigate boundary layer effects. Filters will be changed-out every 24 hours.

 Rationale: Monitor for 14 consecutive days to determine typical ambient air exposure concentrations
 associated with the normal ambient conditions and fugitive emissions from the coal power plant.
 Procedures: Place MultiRae Plus using the data logging function at locations identified below. Sampling will be
 accomplished approximately 4 to 6 feet above the ground level to account for the breathing zone. Equipment
 will be placed at a distance of at least twice the height from any on-site/off-site obstruction (buildings, trees,
 etc.), to mitigate boundary layer effects. Every 8 hours data should be downloaded and logged in the field data
 log. Personnel should check and recharge batteries as required.

 plant
 Rationale: Sampling from the center of the site will be representative of typical ambient conditions. The
 sampling point nearest the coal plant will take into account worst case conditions when wind direction causes
 the site to be downwind from the plant.
 Meteorological and Topographic Considerations
 The site is located in a relatively open area. Monitoring stations to record wind direction and speed, barometric
 pressure, and ambient air temperature will be established at each sampling location and recorded for each
 sampling event. It is important to note which sampling events took place when conditions placed the site
 downwind from the coal plant.
 QA/QC Requirements
 The DPS, DCS, and the MultiRae Plus must be calibrated pre- and post-sampling in accordance with
 manufacturer’s specifications and sampling and analytical methods.
 Trip blanks and collocated samples.
 PM10, PM2.5 and heavy metals samples: Submit one trip blank for each 10 field samples taken, or fraction
 thereof.
 PAHs: Submit trip blank and duplicate sample for each 10 field samples taken.

 Sampling Locations (refer to site map):
 The site will be divided into 6 testing areas approximately 1 acre each. A 5-by-5 sampling grid will be overlaid
 for each testing area. A random number generator will be used to select two sets of 5 cells from the total of 25
 cells in the grid to determine sampling locations for the discrete samples that will be collected to produce 2
 composite samples for each 1 acre testing area.
 MGRS coordinates will be recorded for each sampling location.
 Field Analytical Equipment Procedures
 Innov-X Alpha 4400 XRF analyzer will be used to screen each sampling location by In situ testing prior to
 sample collection to determine the presence of heavy metals contamination to validate homogenous
 distribution. All readings will be recorded for each sampling location. For any sample location with results
 greater than a 50-percent variance from baseline average concentration of all the sampling locations in the
 testing area, a discrete sample will be taken at that particular location.
 Sampling Procedures
 Each discrete sample will be collected at the approximate center of the cell using a clean stainless steel trowel
 and placed in a clean stainless steel compositing pan. Each discrete sample will be approximately equal in
 size. All existing vegetation will be removed prior to sample collection. Any extraneous material such as rocks,
 leaves, and etc., will be removed from the soil samples before compositing. After five discrete samples have
 been collected into the pan, the soil will be homogenized by mixing or blending. Aliquots of approximately
 equal size will be extracted from the stainless steel bowl using the trowel and placed in an EPA approved
 sample container. Sample material remaining in the stainless steel bowl will be re-composited by mixing prior
 to extraction of successive aliquots. Sufficient samples will be removed to completely fill the container for each
 sample.

 Note: discolored soil, stressed vegetation, etc., should be noted for the sampling location, if present.
 QA/QC Requirements
 Two duplicate samples will be taken.
 Sampling trowel and compositing pan will be decontaminated with de-ionized water after each composite
 sample or after a discrete sample is taken due to high field analytical screening result.
 XRF standardization and QA/QC procedures will be followed per instrument standard operating procedures.
 All samples will be placed in the appropriate sample container, preserved, and shipped to ensure compliance
 with holding times as identified above.

    OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT

Once Service preventive medicine personnel complete an OEHSA report and input all information into the
DOEHRS they are able to generate an OEHSA report that provides a record of all information collected
throughout Phases I and II of the OEHSA. This report also documents the consolidated conceptual site model that
is then used to drive the Phase III sampling and analysis plan.

C.2 EXAMPLE SURVEY REPORT

A sample survey report is included in order to give Service preventive medicine personnel an example of a
DOEHRS-generated OEHSA report. This sample report provides an example of the level of information that
preventive medicine personnel should collect and record in order to provide comprehensive documentation of the
survey findings.

complete exposure pathway. A determination used by Service preventive medicine personnel stating that all
  five components of an exposure pathway are present.

conceptual site model (CSM). The defining element of the occupational and environmental health site
  assessment, it is a compilation of complete and potentially complete exposure pathways for occupational and
  environmental health threat sources migrating to actual or potential populations at risk at a site.

Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS). Joint Services
  approved information management system used to fully execute, document, and manage the occupational and
  environmental health site assessment.

environmental medium. The physical environment that surrounds or contacts human beings (e.g., water, soil,
  air, or other), and through which chemicals or pollutants can move and reach them.

exposure assessment sampling. Sampling to accurately characterize occupational and environmental
  health exposures to a population at risk supporting health risk assessments and documentation of a Service
  member’s longitudinal exposure records for the particular deployment location and time period.

exposure pathway. The five components that provide exposure to the population at risk: (1) source, (2)
  environmental medium, (3) health threat, (4) route of exposure, and (5) population affected.

health threat. A composite of ongoing or potential enemy actions; adverse environmental, occupational, and
  geographic and meteorological conditions; endemic diseases; and employment of nuclear, biological, and
  chemical weapons (to include weapons of mass destruction) that have the potential to affect the short- or long-
  term health (including psychological impact) of personnel. (JP 1-02, Source: JP 4-02)

incomplete exposure pathway. A determination used by Service preventive medicine personnel stating that
  one or more of the five components of an exposure pathway are not present and the pathway is broken.

Joint Service Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment Template. The data
  collection tool used as a guide to identify occupational and environmental health threats at a location and build
  a comprehensive conceptual model for that deployment site.

periodic occupational and environmental monitoring summary (POEMS). Official Joint Service
  document that summarizes the DOD medical interpretation of occupational and environmental health exposure
  data for deployment sites where Service members are operating and may be exposed.

population affected. An individual or a group of human beings whose health is potentially impacted by a
  health threat.

potentially complete exposure pathway. A determination used by Service preventive medicine personnel
  stating that it is possible that all five components of an exposure pathway are present.

preliminary hazard assessment (PLHA). The process of reviewing and collecting relevant intelligence
  data, past hazard assessments, other available predeployment data, and/or on-site occupational and
  environmental health site assessment activities for the deployment location to identify potential occupational
  and environmental health threat sources and their relative health risks to a population at risk.
