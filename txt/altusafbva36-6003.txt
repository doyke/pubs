DID YOU ASK?




   A person cannot consent to sexual relations if he or she
is asleep, incapacitated or underage. You can’t coerce
consent. Know the law and ask yourself…

Do I really have consent? What does the law say?
               What would my partner say?
                 For more information about sexual assault and consent, please
