                                          Chapter 2

                             COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. General. The AFSOC Command and Control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized command and control and execution. The result is a C2
mechanism which keeps the AFSOC/CC informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while
enabling the Wing/CC, Group/CC, or Squadron/CC to exercise control over the day-to-day
operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)-assigned Air Force Special
Operations Forces (AFSOF) aircraft, while the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs)
have OPCON of theater-based assets.
EXCEPTION: In practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is
routinely delegated to the Wing/CC or Group/CC. The Wing/CC or Group/CC, in turn, exercises
control of non-close-hold missions through command post supporting wing or group. In the
event that assigned forces undergo a change in operation control (CHOP), responsibility for
mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command.
Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent operational plan (OPLAN), operational
order (OPORD), deployment order (DEPORD), or execution order (EXORD).

NOTE: For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may compel the Wing or Group
Commander to shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command post to another wing,
group, or theater agency. The Wing/CC or Group/CC will ensure procedures are established for
the responsible agency to monitor mission progress and advise the HQ AFSOC/A3 or
AFSOF/CC as appropriate.
2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the AFSOC Operations
Center monitors all AFSOC assigned aircraft moving to, from, or between off-station locations.
The Operations Center tracks off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility Command (AMC) C2
system and direct reporting from aircrew and command post personnel. Key components of the
AMC C2 system are the Airlift Implementation and Monitoring System (AIMS), the Global
Decision Support System (GDSS), and various AMC C2 facilities at theater and wing locations.
Information on scheduled activity comes from the wings, who input AIMS data for all upcoming
missions except local missions not scheduled to land outside the local flying area or close-hold
missions that cannot be accommodated by classified ―J-coded‖ AIMS setups. When aircraft are
deployed in support of operations and exercises, the Operations Center obtains additional
information from Situation Reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports (DSR). The
following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in
nature and have not been CHOPed to another command:
   2.3.1. Wing (or equivalent) command posts track continental United States (CONUS)
   movements of their aircraft and directly input mission information into the GDSS. These
   actions keep the MAJCOM/CC informed of the status and location of CONUS forces.
   2.3.2. Information on outside continental United States (OCONUS) movements of AFSOC
   aircraft (CONUS or theater-based) comes to the AFSOC Command Center via GDSS or
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                             13


   telephone notification from the overseas host unit command posts. The host unit command
   posts receive their data from the aircrews directly or via the Special Operations Command
   and Control Squadron or Element (SOCCS or SOCCE).
   2.3.3. Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility. The Mission Commander
   (MC) or PIC should ensure the following information is relayed to the AMC C2 facility at
   least 30 minutes prior to landing: call sign(s), mission number(s), estimated time of arrival
   (ETA), maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing, the MC or
   PIC will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure
   information. In addition, CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must keep their
   home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected
   takeoff times, and other related information.
   2.3.4. Unclassified Missions at Bases without an AMC C2 Facility. The MC or PIC will
   report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected
   takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the theater command post/reporting agency or
   AFSOC Command Center. Methods of communicating this information include high
   frequency (HF) phone patch, Defense Switched Network (DSN), and commercial telephone.
   CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their home station
   command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.
   2.3.5. J-coded AIMS Missions. When operating on J-coded missions, the MC or PIC will
   pass movement reports to the appropriate C2 facility. The MC or PIC will make
   arrangements with the theater command post/reporting agency or AFSOC Command Center
   to pass pertinent flight information via secure voice or data communications. If necessary,
   call on an unclassified line and report. For example, ―Loaded and ready to go. Estimated
   Time of Departure (ETD) is as fragged.‖
NOTE: For missions requiring special handling above and beyond basic J-code procedures, C2
procedures will be outlined in the tasking directive.

2.7. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.
If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.7.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission should be authorized by the commander with
   OPCON, except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather
   conditions or facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the
   MC or PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
   2.7.2. The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for ensuring
   destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                 15


   2.7.3. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that
   may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
   2.7.4. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure
   the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate. If the planned alternate
   is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other
   suitable alternates.
2.8. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD)
to cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, incorporates the appropriate directive
and provides uniform policies and procedures service members must follow when supporting
federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and
restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law
enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from
civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels.

                                            Chapter 4

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC. If one
crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this
acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with
the same item or system inoperative. When the PIC considers an item essential, designate the
component Mission Essential (ME) on the aircraft maintenance forms, and the item will be
repaired or replaced prior to departure.
       4.1.1. The PIC is the approval authority for operations with degraded equipment within
       the guidelines of the aircraft Minimum Equipment List (MEL). Operating outside of the
       aircraft MEL guidelines requires Group/CC or COMAFSOF approval. For contingency
       operations when communication issues prevent any possibility of a waiver request, the
       PIC is the approval authority for operating outside the aircraft MEL guidelines but must
       notify the chain of command of the situation as soon as conditions permit. Tactical and
       airdrop missions fall outside the scope of the MEL and the PIC will ensure that
       equipment necessary for the mission being flown is operational.
   4.1.2. One Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. A one time flight is defined as a required flight to a final destination
   including required fuel stops.
       4.1.2.1. The squadron commander, chief of maintenance, MC, or deployed maintenance
       representative must authorize this release.
       4.1.2.2. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF must authorize the flight after maintenance has
       released the aircraft for flight operations.
       4.1.2.3. The maintenance release, OG/CC or COMAFSOF approval, and the PIC‘s
       concurrence are all required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified repair
       destination.
4.2. Policy4.2 . This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. If
the PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, the PIC will coordinate
mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance
requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not
adversely impact follow-on missions. Reference the aircraft MEL, Master Minimum Equipment
List (MMEL), Minimum Essential Subsystem List (MESL), or Kinds of Equipment List (KOEL)
for aircraft systems and equipment required for operations. For aircraft without a MEL, MMEL,
MESL, KOEL, or similar document, comply with Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) guidance
on Instrument and Equipment Requirements and Inoperative Instruments and Equipment.
   4.2.1. Pressurization and/or Air-conditioning Systems.        If installed on the aircraft,
   pressurization and/or the air-conditioning system should be operational if patients are carried.
   If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue (coordinate with the senior
   medical crew member when patients are carried) to a destination with repair capability.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                              21


   Required en route stops are authorized. The PIC will brief passengers and patients on the
   possibility of personal discomfort.
   4.2.2. Retractable Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only
   a full stop landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
EXCEPTION: If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that
further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a
destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and
locked position. Required en route stops are authorized.
   4.2.3. Radar. If installed, the weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of
   known or forecast thunderstorms.
   4.2.4. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Navigational Systems. Ensure aircraft GPS
   navigational systems are certified IAW Technical Standard Order (TSO) C129A, Airborne
   Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Aircrews
   will comply with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, AFMAN 11-
   217, Volumes 1 and 2, Instrument Flight Rules, and the GPS operations manual on the use of
   GPS navigational systems for flight operations.

                                  AIRLAND OPERATIONS

5.1. Aircraft Maximum Operating Weight Policy. Waiver authority for operations above the
maximum ramp, takeoff, or landing weights listed in the aircraft AFM or POH is OG/CC or
COMAFSOF. Waivers will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/A3V for tracking purposes.
5.2. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items have been accomplished.
   5.2.1. The Pilot Flying (PF) will initiate all checklists unless the AFM, POH or this
   instruction establishes an alternate procedure.
   5.2.2. Each aircrew member will use the HQ AFSOC/A3V approved checklist for the
   appropriate aircraft and duty position when conducting ground or flight operations. Self
   prepared or ―cheat sheet‖ checklists are not authorized for ground or flight usage.
   5.2.3. Aircrews may use approved checklists modified with notes, amplifying procedures,
   and limits provided the checklist and notes are current. Currency of notes is the crew
   member‘s responsibility.
   5.2.4. Before Landing Checklists. Aircrew will complete the Before Landing Checklist
   IAW aircraft specific addenda no lower than 200 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). Aircraft
   will be established on final, wings level, with a controlled rate of descent in a position to
   execute a safe landing no lower than 100 feet AGL.
5.3. Duty Station. All crew members will be at their duty stations during all takeoffs,
departures, low levels (below MSA), airdrops, approaches, and landings. During other phases of
flight, crew members may leave their duty stations to meet physiological needs and perform
normal crew duties. Only one pilot may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the
Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to departing assigned primary duty station.
   5.3.1. During single pilot operations, the pilot will occupy the left seat or seat specified in
   the AFM or POH.
   5.3.2. Pilot in-flight seat swaps may be accomplished only with a qualified pilot at the flight
   controls and above 1,000 feet AGL.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Guidance
   5.4.1. All takeoffs and landing will be made by the Pilot In Command (PIC) from the left
   seat if the PIC has less than 100 flight hours as PIC in an NSAv aircraft. In the event the PIC
   deems the copilot more capable of safely executing the maneuver (example: in case of PIC
   incapacitation, equipment malfunction, etc.), the copilot may conduct the maneuver.
   5.4.2. A current and qualified instructor pilot (IP) may takeoff and land from either seat.
   During IP upgrade training, the student in IP upgrade training may takeoff and land from
   either seat.
   5.4.3. A certified short field or semi-prepared surface Mission Pilot or IP may takeoff or
   land from either seat during short field or semiprepared surface operations.
   5.4.4. The PIC will land the aircraft from the left seat during:
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                23


       5.4.4.1. Aircraft emergencies unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.4.2. Missions with patients on board the aircraft.
       5.4.4.3. Missions with Distinguished Visitor (DV) 4 or higher on board the aircraft.
       5.4.4.4. Missions operating in areas of hostile activity unless conditions prevent
       compliance.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operation.
   5.5.1. The crew member designated by the AFM or POH will operate the retractable landing
   gear. If the AFM or POH does not designate which pilot will operate the landing gear, the
   pilot closest to the landing gear handle that does not interfere with throttle(s), condition
   lever(s), or propeller lever(s) operations will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing
   gear upon command of the PF. Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the Pilot Not Flying
   (PNF) will acknowledge the PF command by repeating the command.
   5.5.2. The flaps will be actuated by the PNF or crew member designated in the AFM, POH,
   or aircraft addendum of this instruction, upon command of the PF.
5.6. Seat Belts.
   5.6.1. Crew members occupying a pilot or mission duty position will have seat belts fastened
   at all times.
EXCEPTION: Evaluators, instructors, or crew members performing required duties not on the
flight deck will have a designated seat and required restraint available.
   5.6.2. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat
   belts securely when directed by the PIC, turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas
   of forecast clear air turbulence.
   5.6.3. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated special operations forces team
   members during contingencies, exercises, or training. The PIC will ensure a tie-down strap
   is rigged for each row of personnel to provide forward restraint and body stability. The
   special operations forces team members should provide their own restraining devices.
       5.6.3.1. Alternate restraints will be secured prior to takeoff and will not be removed until
       after landing unless required to meet physiological needs or perform mission related
       duties.
       5.6.3.2. Accomplish troop security by one of the following methods in descending order
       of preference:
           5.6.3.2.1. Seatbelts or snap links attached to tie-down rings on the cabin floor.
           5.6.3.2.2. Five thousand (5,000) pound tie-down straps.
           5.6.3.2.3. Static Line Kit.
   5.6.4. Except for primary, additional aircrew, and special operations forces team members,
   all cabin occupants must be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoff, approach and
   landing. Passengers authorized flight on tactical missions may be secured by alternate
   methods for takeoffs and landings provided they do not interfere with primary crew

5.7. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1,
General Flight Rules, and AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
except when in compliance with contingency requirements or guidance.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                             25


   5.7.1. During NVG training operations, the aircrew may turn off anticollision and strobe
   light(s) when on final approach for landing within two nautical miles (NM) of touchdown
   zone, on the landing surface, and immediately after takeoff. For all other areas of NVG
   operations, aircrew will comply with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight
   Rules.
   5.7.2. If Infrared (IR) covers are installed on any of the aircraft lighting systems, the PIC
   will verify that the other overt lighting systems are operable prior to takeoff.
5.8. Advisory Calls During Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Operations. The following are
mandatory altitude calls made by the PNF:
   5.8.1. Non-precision Approaches.
      5.8.1.1. ―100 above‖ when 100 feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA) or step
      down altitude.
      5.8.1.2. ―Minimums‖ at MDA.
      5.8.1.3. ―Runway in sight‖ when the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in
      a position to execute a safe landing.
      5.8.1.4. ―Go-around‖ at or below MDA or at the missed approach point and the runway
      environment is not in sight, when the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe
      landing, when directed by ATC facility, or conditions on the runway will not allow a safe
      landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or aircraft on the runway).
   5.8.2. Precision Approaches.
      5.8.2.1. ―100 above‖ when 100 feet above final approach altitude, glideslope intercept
      altitude, or decision height (DH).
      5.8.2.2. ―Continue‖ at DH with approach light system visible and the aircraft is in a
      position to execute a safe landing. Do not continue the approach below 100 feet if usable
      runway visual cues are not present.
      5.8.2.3. ―Land‖ at DH with the runway environment in sight and the aircraft is in a
      position to execute a safe landing.
      5.8.2.4. ―Goaround‖ at or below DH and the runway environment is not in sight or if the
      aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe landing, when directed by ATC facility, or
      conditions on the runway will not allow a safe landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or
      aircraft on the runway).
   5.8.3. Climb/Descent.
      5.8.3.1. ―1,000 feet above/below‖ assigned altitude or flight level.
   5.8.4. Altimeter settings. Both pilots will state and set the altimeter setting as issued by
   ATC, weather reporting facilities (ATIS, AWOS, ASOS, etc.), or when passing a Transition
   Level or Altitude (e.g., Flight Level 180).
   5.8.5. Deviations:
      5.8.5.1. Any crew member will immediately advise the PF when observing unannounced
      heading deviations greater than 10 degrees, airspeed deviations of 10 knots, altitude
 26                                                   AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       deviations of 100 feet during approach or 200 feet while en route, or potential terrain or
       obstruction problems and no attempt is being made by the PF to correct the deviation.
       5.8.5.2. Any aircrew member will announce deviations from prescribed procedures for
       the approach being flown to the PF when no attempt is being made to correct the
       deviation.
5.9. Communications Guidance. The PIC will determine communication requirements during
mission planning.      Ensure all mission frequencies, cryptological data, mission radio
configuration, and mission radio monitoring responsibilities are outlined during the preflight
briefing. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit voice
recorder (CVR), if installed, and CVR is operating. Ensure any recorded classified conversations
are removed. When available, all crew members will monitor the aircraft interphone.
5.10. Crosswind Limits. Do not exceed AFM or POH crosswind flap configuration limitations.
For aircraft without AFM or POH crosswind limitations, use appropriate information (e.g.,
Maximum Demonstrated Crosswind capabilities) for limitations.
5.11. Wake Turbulence Avoidance.
   5.11.1. The PIC will exercise caution when conducting taxi or flight operations within the
   vicinity of helicopter(s) or tilt-rotor aircraft. In a slow hover-taxi or stationary hover near the
   surface, helicopter main rotor(s) or tilt-rotor aircraft generate downwash producing high
   velocity vortices to a distance approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. In
   forward flight, departing or landing helicopters or tilt-rotor aircraft produce a pair of strong,
   high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft.
   5.11.2. Refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2, Instrument Flight Procedures, General
   Planning, and the Airman‘s Information Manual (AIM) for additional wake turbulence
   information and wake turbulence avoidance techniques. A reliable timing source will be
   used to ensure appropriate separation is achieved.
WARNING: Wind can affect the path and duration of wake turbulence thereby prolonging the
turbulence hazard or placing the turbulence in an unanticipated location. The PF is expected to
adjust aircraft operations and flight path as necessary to preclude serious wake turbulence
encounters.
5.12. LZ and LZ Markings.
   5.12.1. The LZ program is a squadron tactics function. The squadron tactics office must
   ensure surveys are conducted and updated IAW AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and
   Landing Zone Procedures, and the procedures below. It is the responsibility of all aircrew
   and/or ground personnel to notify the point of contact (POC) for the squadron LZ survey
   program, in a timely manner, of any changes or discrepancies on existing surveys.
   5.12.2. A thorough review of the LZ survey and accompanying photographs, computer
   drawings, or imagery will be accomplished by all crew members during the aircrew brief.
   The PIC is responsible for ensuring that any crew member unable to attend the brief either
   reviews the landing zone survey or is briefed on the hazards associated with the LZ.
   5.12.3. Aircrews may conduct airland operations at airfields specified in AFI 13-217,
   AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                27


  5.12.4. Tactical LZ surveys may be used during exercises and operational missions when a
  full LZ survey is unavailable due to the situation. Requests to use tactical surveys will be
  forwarded to OG/CC or COMAFSOF for review and approval.
  5.12.5. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF may approve the use of other DoD services or host
  nation equivalent LZ surveys.
  5.12.6. LZ markings may vary depending upon the supporting agency or airfield
  construction. Refer to AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
  Procedures, for LZ marking descriptions. The overt and covert markings and signals to be
  used during LZ operations will be established during mission planning and included in the
  aircrew briefing.
     5.12.6.1. NSAv aircrews may land at an LZ marked with any Airfield Marking Pattern
     (AMP) configuration IAW AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
     Procedures, or this instruction provided the pilots define identifiable touchdown and go-
     around points (e.g., visual point/location, timing past intended landing point, etc.) prior to
     landing. Overt or covert markings may be used to define a LZ.
     5.12.6.2. Short Field AMP-3 markings will consist of a touchdown zone marked by four
     IR lights at the corners of the touchdown zone. An IR strobe will mark the end of the
     usable LZ surface or distance specified in Figure 5.1. Pilots not certified in short field
     operations will use AMP-3 touchdown zone marking distances IAW paragraph
     5.14.5.1.1.
     5.12.6.3. Operations using AMP-4 markings. Aircrews will define an identifiable
     touchdown and go-around point, especially when runway required is the minimum length
     required by this instruction.
 28                                               AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


Figure 5.1. AMP-3 (Box and One) Configuration.




NOTE: Figure depicts AMP-3 configuration for short field certified pilots operations. Non-
certified short field pilots will use AMP-3 light configuration distances IAW 5.14.5.1.1.
5.13. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Requirements. ARFF requirements at non-
USAF active flying bases are as follows:
   5.13.1. Up to eight takeoffs and landings within four consecutive days may be accomplished
   at a LZ or airfield without ARFF equipment or local established aircraft incident procedures.
   Each flying squadron will track airfield usage to ensure this requirement is met. OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF is waiver authority for more frequent flight operations at these locations.
   5.13.2. Refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Exercises and Contingency
   Response Operations, to calculate ARFF requirements. Non-USAF ARFF vehicles may be
   used if the agent and pumping capabilities are equivalent.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                29


   5.13.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire
   Protection for Exercises and Contingency Response Operations.
   5.13.4. The squadron commander may authorize operations at training LZs and local
   airfields that do not possess local ARFF services.
5.14. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures
whenever practical. For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and
stressed or authorized for normal operations, the overruns may be used to increase the runway
available for takeoff. Base all aircraft performance requirements on actual or predicted
environmental conditions (e.g., pressure altitude, temperature, aircraft weight, runway surface
conditions, etc.).
   5.14.1. Taxiway width. Minimum width for all operations is 150% of aircraft wheel track.
   5.14.2. Runway width. Minimum width for all operations is 200% of aircraft wheel track.
   5.14.3. Normal Operations:
       5.14.3.1. Takeoff and Landing. Minimum runway length is Accelerate-Stop Distance,
       Critical Field Length, Balanced Field Length, or most applicable data (e.g., Takeoff
       Distance to 50 Feet) corrected for environmental conditions IAW AFM, POH or NSAv
       Addendum, whichever is more restrictive.
       5.14.3.2. Touch-and-go operations. For aircraft with approved touch-and-go operations
       procedures and runway requirements not outlined in the aircraft AFM/POH, refer to
       aircraft specific addendum for minimum runway lengths.
       5.14.3.3. Stop-and-go operations. Available runway distance remaining after stopping
       the aircraft will be at least Accelerate-Stop Distance, Critical Field Length, or Balanced
       Field Length. If the runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve the appropriate
       distance.
   5.14.4. Short field operations:
       5.14.4.1. Only short field certified pilots or pilots receiving formal syllabus instruction
       may perform short field operations.
       5.14.4.2. Takeoff. Minimum runway length for a short field takeoff is the charted
       Takeoff Ground Roll/Run + 10% of Takeoff Ground Roll/Run adjusted for
       environmental factors (e.g. wind, coefficient of rolling friction, surface conditions, etc.)
       as outlined in the AFM/POH.
       5.14.4.3. Landing. Minimum runway length for a short field landing is the charted
       Landing Ground Roll + 10% of Landing Ground Roll adjusted for environmental factors
       (e.g., wind, coefficient of rolling friction, surface conditions, etc.) as outlined in the
       AFM/POH.
CAUTION: Landing at an airfield based on landing ground roll may not provide the aircrew
with the required takeoff ground roll without off-loading pax, cargo, or fuel.
       5.14.4.4. Short Field Stop-and-Go Operations. Available runway distance remaining
       after stopping the aircraft will be at least Takeoff Ground Roll/Run + 10% of Takeoff
 30                                                   AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       Ground Roll/Run. If the runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve Takeoff
       Ground Roll/Run +10% of Takeoff Ground Roll/Run.
WARNING: Aircraft performance is based upon rotating and climbing on criteria outlined in
AFM/POH. Failure to maintain aircraft performance criteria may not allow for safe clearance of
obstacles.

WARNING: Do not use tabulated data for initial short field takeoff and landing. Performance is
too critical for the approximations in tabulated data.
       5.14.4.5. Multiple engine aircraft must meet or exceed a climb gradient of 35:1 from the
       end of the useable LZ with one engine inoperative.
   5.14.5. NVG Operations may be conducted using normal or short field operational
   procedures.
       5.14.5.1. Pilots not certified in short field operations:
           5.14.5.1.1. NVG AMP-3 landings can be performed by any pilot qualified to perform
           NVG landings. AMP-3 landings will have a minimum touchdown zone using 200%
           of wheel track for width by 500 feet long, and runway remaining after the touchdown
           zone will be at least Accelerate-Stop Distance.
           5.14.5.1.2. NVG AMP-4 landings can be performed by any pilot qualified to perform
           NVG landings. AMP-4 landings will have a clearly defined intended point of landing
           and runway remaining after intended point of landing will be at least Accelerate-Stop
           Distance.
       5.14.5.2. A STS controller (or qualified equivalent) or an active control tower is required
       to conduct NVG landings at unlit or covertly marked landing zones or airfields.
           5.14.5.2.1. Squadron qualified landing zone safety officers (LZSO) may accomplish
           these duties IAW AFI 13-217.
   5.14.6. Semiprepared surface operations:
       5.14.6.1. Semiprepared surfaces are defined in AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone
       and Landing Zone Procedures. Only semiprepared surface certified pilots or pilots
       receiving formal syllabus instruction may perform semiprepared surface operations.
       5.14.6.2. Pilots will only perform stop-and-go or full stop landings on semi-prepared
       surfaces. Reference AFM/POH for information on aircraft performance on semiprepared
       surfaces.
5.15. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. In addition to the requirements of AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, comply with the following:
   5.15.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet.         With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet.
EXCEPTION: When operating at a civilian airport and taxiing on a Fixed Based Operator
(FBO) ramp, the PIC may taxi the aircraft within 25 feet of obstacles or other aircraft without
wing walkers when using marked taxi routes. The PIC will comply with marshaller instructions.
Taxi routes must be used by similar types of aircraft for which the routes were designed and in
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                  31


specifically designed parking spots. Support equipment shall be located in appropriately
designated areas. In austere locations where wing walkers and taxi lines do not exist and
obstacle distances are questionable, the PIC must use good crew coordination and sound
judgment to effectively mitigate risk to the aircraft.
   5.15.2. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstacle.
   5.15.3. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable
   or if provided and doubt still exists as to proper clearance, deplane a crew member to
   maintain obstruction clearance.
5.16. Reverse Taxi. CAUTION: Using brakes to stop the aircraft while reverse taxiing may
result in aircraft empennage contacting the ground.
   5.16.1. The pilot performing reverse taxi operations will coordinate reverse taxi directions
   and signals to be used with the marshaller and loadmaster (if applicable) prior to
   commencing reverse taxi operations.
       5.16.1.1. Mission requirements and aircraft configuration permitting, aircraft equipped
       with an aft cargo ramp and/or door that is certified for in-flight operations will open the
       door and lower the ramp (if applicable) to approximately the horizontal position.
       5.16.1.2. The loadmaster or another crew member will be in a position to direct reverse
       taxi, report any hazards and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns,
       distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
   5.16.2. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure visibility in the taxi area is
   sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.
   5.16.3. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
   5.16.4. Secure all cargo and ensure passengers are seated prior to reverse taxi operations.
5.17. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria:
   5.17.1. The mission directive is confirmation that the tasking agency (e.g., MC, Operations
   Group or COMAFSOF staff, etc.) has reviewed the airfields of intended operation for
   obstructions and other hazards in accordance with AF and AFSOC directives. The mission
   tasking agency will advise aircrews of known obstructions and other factors that could be
   hazardous to flight operations. The PIC will not make an approach and landing into an
   airfield requiring certification by the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restriction Report
   (ASRR), unless they have previously operated into that airfield as a pilot or observer and
   have reviewed the airfield certification briefing and audiovisual program within the last 14
   days or before departing home station, whichever is closer to the date of intended use.
   Reference AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, for information on
   ASRR waiver authority.
   5.17.2. For a LZ to be suitable for operations, the LZ must meet the following obstacle
   clearance criteria listed below.
       5.17.2.1. Reference 5.14.1 and 5.14.2 for runway and taxiway width requirements.
       5.17.2.2. Shoulders: Not required.
       5.17.2.3. Clear Zone: Minimum of 500 feet.
 32                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       5.17.2.4. Lateral Obstruction Clearance.
           5.17.2.4.1. Zone A (measured from runway centerline):           (Wing Span + Wheel
           Track)/2
           5.17.2.4.2. Zone B (measured from runway centerline):           ((Wing Span + Wheel
           Track) + (10% of Wing Span))/2
       5.17.2.5. Maximum Obstacle Height.
           5.17.2.5.1. For semiprepared surface taxiways and runways, obstacles will not be
           higher than four inches unless AFM, POH, or aircraft addendum to this instruction is
           more restrictive.
           5.17.2.5.2. Single Engine Low Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 12 inches, Zone B – 60
           inches.
           5.17.2.5.3. Single Engine High Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 36 inches, Zone B – 60
           inches.
           5.17.2.5.4. Multiengine Low Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 4 inches, Zone B – 60 inches.
           5.17.2.5.5. Multiengine High Wing Aircraft: Zone A – 36 inches, Zone B – 60
           inches.
       5.17.2.6. Approach Zone. No obstructions higher than 1 foot for every 35 feet (35:1, or
       as appropriate for a specific aircraft) in the approach zone.
   5.17.3. Reference AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, for
   additional information on LZ criteria for shoulders, graded areas, transitional area, clear and
   approach zones.
5.18. Operations Over Arresting Cables:
   5.18.1. Avoid landing on non-recessed arresting cables.
   5.18.2. Avoid rolling over arresting cables at high speed during taxi, takeoff, or landing to
   preclude damage to bottom of aircraft. Maintain appropriate backpressure on aircraft yoke to
   reduce nose landing gear down force if maintaining a high speed during taxi, takeoff, or
   landing over a raised arresting cable.
5.19. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi. Ground crews using
appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft. Aircrews may recover the aircraft at
austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the
surface will support the aircraft.
5.20. Inter. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the runway. The decision to make
intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander. Base TOLD card computations on
the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.
5.21. Reduced Power Operations. To extend engine life, use reduced power procedures, if
specified in the AFM/POH, as much as possible during normal operations. During training when
multiple touch-and-go operations are being performed, takeoff power may be reduced as directed
by the AFM/POH.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                              33


5.22. Engines Running On-load or Off-load (ERO).
   5.22.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
   cargo. See aircraft specific addendum for airframe unique procedures. Comply with all
   POH/AFM limitations and checklists.
   5.22.2. General Procedures:
      5.22.2.1. The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
      specific crew member duties.
      5.22.2.2. If applicable, cargo doors may be opened prior to parking to prepare for cargo
      off-load or on-load, provided all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the
      cargo compartment.
      5.22.2.3. The parking brake will normally be set and one pilot will monitor brakes,
      interphone, and primary ground communications radio.
      5.22.2.4. Operate engines in ground idle power and condition lever settings. If conditions
      warrant, lower flaps to reduce prop blast aft of the aircraft. When operating split-shaft
      propeller engine(s), consider feathering the propellers using the propeller lever for the
      ERO. Aircraft operating the propeller through a combined propeller and condition lever
      that does not allow feathering a propeller without shutting down the engine should not
      perform propeller feathering operations.
      5.22.2.5. Aircraft commanders should consider using any overt lighting that would assist
      the ERO and enhance safety.
      5.22.2.6. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists, and weight and balance for
      the subsequent sortie if passengers or cargo are onloaded or downloaded.
      5.22.2.7. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the crew may remove all tie-downs
      except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the
      aircraft is stopped and vehicle drivers are in place. Brief drivers not to release vehicle
      parking brakes until all restraint is removed and cleared by the crew.
      5.22.2.8. When available, the loadmaster will direct all on-loading or off-loading
      operations using pre-briefed signals. Other qualified crew members may assist the
      operation; however, the PIC or loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
      5.22.2.9. Passengers will be escorted by a crew member, if available, when enplaning or
      deplaning.
      5.22.2.10. Resume taxi when all crew members have verbally acknowledged that the
      aircraft is ready for taxi.

6.8. Intelligence Briefing. Before departing on missions outside the United States, crew will
receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and
military development in the area in which they will be operating. In theater, aircrews should
receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location, or en route stop,
and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelligence
value to the local intelligence officers at the completion of each mission.
6.9. Authenticators and Classified Material. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators and
other classified materials required for area being transited. Carry authenticators when flying into
an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), participating in exercises, on overseas missions,
deployments, and when specified in operation plans. The communications security (COMSEC)
material required depends on the theater of operation and user.
   6.9.1. Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at destination (if applicable) and

Agriculture, Immunization, and quarantine requirements. The unit dispatching the mission is
responsible for border clearance and other special clearances when required. Entry into foreign
countries by personnel and equipment is directed by military agreements, diplomatic agreements,
directives of the operational control commander, International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) standards, and the FCG.

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.12. Briefing Requirements. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide
mission essential information. Use briefing guides in Attachment 2. The PIC will ensure their
crews receive a briefing, prior to each mission, covering all specific areas to be accomplished.
   6.12.1. If critical pre-mission duties conflict with the briefing, the PIC may excuse crew
   members. Prior to engine start, the PIC will give a mission brief to any excused crew
   members detailing all areas pertinent to their duties.
   6.12.2. If known, the PIC will brief the following factors:
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                39


      6.12.2.1. Weather. Determine recent weather and its effect on the takeoff, mission, and
      landing areas. Wind will be evaluated by the aircrew for its effect.
      6.12.2.2. TOLD. Compute and brief applicable TOLD and power requirements for
      mission, airfield, or LZ operations.
      6.12.2.3. Approach and Departure. Brief the planned approach and departure routes as
      well as significant terrain features.
      6.12.2.4. Airfield/LZ/DZ dimensions and surface conditions.

      include the takeoff and landing commitment points.
      6.12.2.6. Other Hazards. Known personnel and equipment locations will be briefed. If
      other aircraft, vehicles or personnel are operating in the area, attempt to determine their
      affect on the LZ, taxi routes, or aircraft parking area. Brief any other special
      considerations such as parking locations, on/off-load procedures, fueling locations,
      equipment and procedures, etc.
      6.12.2.7. Aircraft commanders will brief their planned profile to the flight authorization
      authenticating official and submit all documentation the day prior to the flight. On
      missions that are scheduled to span several days, the entire profile will be briefed prior to
      departure. Any changes to the briefed profile after departure, including (but not limited
      to) weather changes that require filing of an alternate not already planned and briefed or
      maintenance issues that degrade the performance of the aircraft, will be discussed with
      the authenticating official prior to subsequent departure. This discussion will ensure the
      risks associated with the modified profile are fully understood by the aircraft commander
      and operations supervisors as well as to establish a dialogue regarding appropriate levels
      of risk mitigation.
   6.12.3. Passenger Briefings.
      6.12.3.1. Prior to each flight, the PIC will ensure that all passengers are briefed. When
      more than one flight is accomplished by the same crew and passengers, subsequent
      briefings are not required, except to brief route information, mission changes, etc. When
      additional passengers are added, brief them completely.
      6.12.3.2. The passenger briefing will include demonstration of seat belt, emergency
      oxygen and fire extinguishing systems, and locations of emergency exits. All overwater
      flights will include a briefing on personal and aircraft life support equipment.
6.13. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review Volume I, Part A, of the FCIF before all
missions.
   6.13.1. Update FCIF Currency Record and Squadron read file, if new material has been
   added to the FCIF since the last review. Legibly enter the last FCIF item number, the current
   date, and initial the FCIF Currency Record or complete required electronic review
   procedures if FCIF is stored electronically (e.g., Patriot Excalibur). When unable to sign the
   FCIF Currency Record or complete electronic FCIF review procedures, initialing and
   numbering the latest FCIF by an individual‘s name on the flight authorization order certifies
   the FCIF Currency review of all items are complete. During deployed operations or

   contingencies, mission planning crews will maintain hard copy of home station or MAJCOM
   FCIFs for aircrew review.
   6.13.2. PIC will ensure any crew members joining a mission en route receive an FCIF
   update. Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for briefing FCIF items.
   6.13.3. Crew members not assigned or attached to the squadron will certify FCIF review by
   entering the last FCIF number and their initials next to their name on the file copy of the
   flight authorization orders.
6.14. Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is the Special
Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS). SOFPARS is a subset of the
Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) that includes the Portable Flight Planning Software
(PFPS) and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Upgraded or new versions of SOFPARS
and JMPS will be released and authorized by the HQ AFSOC/A3 for use after applicable testing
has been completed (OPR: 623 AOC/CSD).
   6.14.1. Electronic Data Transfer. If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the
   aircraft electronically, it must be an AFSOC approved system. HQ AFSOC/A3 will
   periodically publish a listing of approved systems. Aircrews will not use unapproved
   versions of any system to load aircraft avionics without 623 AOC/CC approval.
6.15. Coordinates. The following procedures will be used:
NOTE: Aircrew will confirm a common datum with their mission users during the mission
planning process. Failure to plan navigation to LZ, DZ, or mission areas using a common datum
may result in errors of up to several miles. Computer based mission planning systems and
aircraft navigational systems generally use WGS84 as reference datum. Attempt to use WGS84
whenever possible to minimize confusion.
   6.15.1. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from maps, charts,
   or related cartographic products, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates will be
   provided. This reference will include the datum map or chart producer, series, sheet number,
   edition and date.
   6.15.2. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from non-
   cartographic sources such as GPS receivers, Analytical Photogrammetric Positioning
   Systems (APPS), or related systems, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates
   will be provided. This reference will include the datum, method used to derive the
   coordinates, agency producing the coordinates, and accuracy of the coordinates.
6.16. Flight Logs. Prepare a flight log for each off-station mission and include the following as
a minimum: turn points, headings, distances, estimated time en route (ETE), minimum safe
altitude (MSA), and fuel computations. A flight log is not required if the above information is
included on a flight map.
   6.16.1. A flight log is not required for local training flights or when mission requirements
   are unknown such as during an alert status. Aircrews are still responsible for complying with
   fuel requirements outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules,
   and this instruction.
6.17. Weather Planning. Comply with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight
Rules, weather minimums unless local or theater specific weather minimums are more restrictive.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                 41


6.18. Lunar Illumination. WARNING: NVGs worn during flights with illumination less than
10%, (―black hole‖ conditions) can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation.
   6.18.1. Any training or operational missions planned when the lunar illumination is forecast
   to be less than 10% during the mission will require an additional level of Operational Risk
   Management (ORM).
6.19. Fuel Planning. Use criteria outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General
Flight Rules. Aircrews will conduct appropriate in-flight planning to ensure proper fuel
management. Reference Attachment 3 for ETP discussion and calculations.
   6.19.1. Plan to arrive in the terminal area at destination or alternate (if required) with:
       6.19.1.1. 30 minutes of fuel remaining during day VFR or night VFR conditions when
       using NVGs (computed at Long Range Cruise power settings).
       6.19.1.2. 45 minutes of fuel remaining during night VFR conditions when not using
       NVGs or IFR conditions (computed at Long Range Cruise power settings).
       6.19.1.3. When two alternates are required, flight plan to the most distant alternate.
   6.19.2. Land with no less than minimum fuel required by AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC
   Sup 1, General Flight Rules.
       6.19.2.1. Refer to appropriate aircraft specific addendum for further aircraft specific
       guidance or restrictions.
   6.19.3. Plan to consume 15 minutes of fuel at Long Range Cruise power settings for each
   instrument approach to be flown.
   6.19.4. Plan an additional 15 minutes of fuel per hour at a maximum cruise power fuel
   consumption rate for that portion of the flight where structural icing or thunderstorms
   requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported.
   6.19.5. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each pound of
   fuel consumed. As a rule of thumb, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for
   each 1,000 feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots
   for each 1,000 feet of altitude decrease.
   6.19.6. Pilots will plan fuel consumption rates at a long range cruise power setting. Plan to
   fly transition legs at long range cruise power settings in an effort to conserve fuel. If a
   maximum cruise power setting is to be used for mission accomplishment, pilots will plan fuel
   consumption rates at this power setting. In either case, if no suitable alternate exists between
   the ETP and final destination, pilots will include an additional 10% of en route fuel to their
   total fuel requirements. Waiver authority for this requirement is the OG/CC or COMAFSOF.
6.20. Objective Area Planning.
   6.20.1. Map Selection. Maps with a scale of 1:500,000 or greater detail are required for
   objective area operations. Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired.
   6.20.2. Pilots will ensure all maps used for flight have the most current hazards posted.
   Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight.
 42                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   6.20.3. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). An ESA is an altitude that will provide positive
   terrain clearance should Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) be encountered. Use
   1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstacle or terrain feature
   within 10 NM of the intended flight path/objective area. An ESA will be computed for all
   objective areas.
NOTE: Mountainous areas are defined as having a 500 foot change in surface altitude over ½
NM. For operations outside of the CONUS, reference AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1,
General Flight Rules.
   6.20.4. MSA. An MSA is an altitude that provides Visual Meteorological Conditions
   (VMC) terrain clearance and limited threat avoidance during degraded aircrew situational
   awareness or periods of task saturation. Use 500 feet above the highest obstacle or terrain
   feature within 5 NM of the intended flight path/objective area. An MSA will be computed
   for all objective areas.
WARNING: Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than
planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed ESA/MSA.
6.21. Flight Plans. Use a DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or DD Form 1801, DoD
International Flight Plan for VFR flights terminating at the base of departure. Aircrews may
file with the FAA using the standard FAA flight plan when departing from a location where
military support is unavailable. If aircrews file with the FAA and their destination is a military
installation, aircrews must notify the destination base operations prior to departure or once
airborne, via the appropriate FAA Flight Service Station, of the planned time of arrival.
6.22. Aircraft Performance.
   6.22.1. Weight and Balance. Weight and balance will be computed using the AFM/POH
   charts, equivalent electronic program, or vector template. A copy of each mission‘s weight
   and balance will be maintained at the squadron or operations center (as applicable) and
   carried with the aircrew. For en route stops, weight and balance need not be recomputed
   provided the zero fuel weight has not changed. The crew will compute in-flight crew and
   passenger equipment movement to ensure center of gravity (CG) limits are not exceeded.
   These computations will be briefed during the crew or mission brief or during flight, as
   required.
   6.22.2. TOLD. Compute TOLD using the AFM/POH performance data charts or approved
   tabulated data. Compute TOLD for initial takeoff prior to engine start. Recompute data for
   pressure altitude changes of 500 feet, temperature changes of 5° Celsius (C), or gross weight
   changes of 500 lbs.
   6.22.3. Computed Engine Out Service Ceiling. For multiengine aircraft, the computed
   engine out service ceiling will not be below the published Minimum Obstruction Clearance
   Altitude (MOCA) on IFR flights or planned VFR cruising altitude unless both of the
   following requirements are met:
       6.22.3.1. The forecast weather for each critical route segment, as defined in paragraph
       6.22.3, is day VMC allowing a VFR descent to a safe VFR altitude during an emergency.
       6.22.3.2. Crews have planned emergency routes to emergency airfields on VFR charts
       (1:500,000 or larger) for the critical route segments.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                   43


Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Aircraft Maintenance Forms.
   6.23.1. Review the aircraft maintenance forms before applying power to the aircraft or
   operating aircraft systems.
   6.23.2. Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized method of payment are on
   board the aircraft. The Air Card is used to pay for services such as aviation fuel, aircraft oil
   and fluids, minor maintenance items, landing fees, aircraft de-icing, follow-me trucks and
   other airfield related services at commercial FBO locations. The PIC is responsible for
   ensuring the receipt is correct and all appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the
   military base, airport, or FBO. The PIC is responsible for turning in all service receipts to
   maintenance upon return to home station. If services do not generate a receipt, the PIC will
   ensure the location and services performed are noted and relayed to maintenance.
   6.23.3. The aircraft preflight or exceptional release (if applicable) must be signed before
   flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized contract civilian
   will sign the preflight or exceptional release. However, it may be signed by the PIC if one of
   these individuals is not available.
   6.23.4. Ensure that aircraft locking keys are in aircraft maintenance forms prior to takeoff.
   6.23.5. Ensure the aircraft protective covers are on board aircraft prior to flight.
6.24. Aircraft Inspections.
   6.24.1. Aircraft inspection should normally be accomplished by the PIC or person
   designated by the PIC.
   6.24.2. Face-to-face turnovers between crew members are acceptable.
   6.24.3. During higher headquarters directed exercises or contingency operations, any
   qualified aircrew may accomplish the preflight inspection and brief the oncoming aircrew.
   6.24.4. Required Equipment. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a
   mission rests with the PIC. If one PIC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission
   segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different
   PIC, to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. If the PIC elects to
   operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements prior
   to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact
   follow-on missions.
   6.24.5. Required Forms. Leased aircraft should contain an appropriate and current
   airworthiness certificate (unless the aircraft is certified as ―experimental‖), effective
   registration certificate, Radio Station Permit for overseas missions, and appropriate Weight
   and Balance information. For multiengine aircraft, the PIC will also ensure one engine
   inoperative procedures, climb and en route performance data is accessible during flight
   operations.
6.25. Alert Aircraft Procedures. To accept an aircraft on alert, complete a normal aircraft
preflight. After 72 hours on alert, allow maintenance personnel access to inspect the aircraft.
 44                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   6.25.1. Parking. Park the alert aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and
   takeoff.
   6.25.2. Climatic Protective Facilities. During periods of extreme cold, hot, or severe
   weather, every effort should be made to shelter alert aircraft and essential equipment in a
   hangar to ensure operational readiness in the event of a mission.
   6.25.3. Flying Alert Aircraft. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual
   alert missions provided the following conditions are complied with:
      6.25.3.1. Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet mission requirements. If not,
      upon flight completion, refuel the aircraft to required alert fuel quantity.
      6.25.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agencies.
      6.25.3.3. A qualified (for the alert mission) aircrew is on board.
      6.25.3.4. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
      area.
   6.25.4. Once accepted for alert, the alert aircrew will make an entry in the aircraft
   maintenance forms, stating, ―Aircraft accepted on alert at _____, _____.‖ (local time and
   date). No maintenance may be performed on it without prior approval of the alert crew PIC
   and notification of the squadron DO or deployed MC. To ensure integrity of the aircrew
   preflight, an alert crew member must be present whenever maintenance is performed, or at
   the completion of the maintenance, the aircrew is required to check the area in which
   maintenance was performed. The check should be performed as soon as practical after the
   maintenance and must be performed prior to flight.
6.26. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.26.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew qualified in refueling operations may perform refueling
   duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support. Aircrews are allowed
   to add engine oil, if needed, at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.
   At military bases, coordinate with local base operations representatives on procedures for
   servicing the aircraft while the aircrew is not present.
   6.26.2. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs should
   not normally be accomplished. If conducted, the appropriate POH or maintenance inspection
   procedures will be used.
6.27. Life Support and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.27.1. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the PIC or designated representative will ensure
   sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable life support, survival equipment, and
   protective clothing for the entire mission are aboard the aircraft. Verify Air Force Technical
   Order (AFTO) IMT 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, prior to departing home
   station. Life support equipment and medical kits weighing less than 200 lbs may be secured
   with seat belts.
   6.27.2. Aircrew members flying single engine aircraft will wear Life Preserver Units (LPU)
   on all overwater flights when route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land.
   For multiengine aircraft, LPUs will be sized and immediately available at the aircrew
   member‘s duty station while flying over water. Passengers will have life preservers available
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                  45


   and will be worn at the discretion of the PIC. Life rafts will be available to accommodate all
   personnel on board. Life rafts and life preservers are not required when overwater flight
   occurs during instrument approach procedures under ATC control, immediately after takeoff,
   and before landing.
   6.27.3. Anti-exposure suits for the aircrew and passengers will be on board during any
   preplanned overwater flights which are beyond power off gliding distance from land and the
   water temperature is 60° Fahrenheit (F)/(16°C) or less. The anti-exposure suits will be worn
   by pilots flying single engine aircraft on flights which are beyond power off gliding distance
   from land and the water temperature is 60° F (16° C) or less.
   6.27.4. Oxygen requirements are outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General
   Flight Rules. On missions with passengers, carry passenger emergency oxygen systems
   (e.g., Passenger Oxygen Kit (POK), Emergency Portable Oxygen System (EPOS), or other
   approved system) if flight is planned above Flight Level (FL) 250 and there are no passenger
   emergency oxygen masks on board.
       6.27.4.1. Personal oxygen masks are required for all missions involving any
       prebreathing.
       6.27.4.2. The loadmaster and any other personnel required to be mobile in the cargo
       compartment will wear helmets during aerial deliveries utilizing an aircraft anchor cable.
   6.27.5. Eye Protection. Use of protective goggles, plastic lens glasses, or helmet visor is
   required if aircrew duties require personnel to be in close proximity to an open exit.
   6.27.6. Restraining Harness. Crew members will wear a restraining harness when near open
   doors, ramps, or hatches in flight.
6.28. In-flight Meals. The pilots will not consume in-flight meals within 1½ hours of each
other during flight if the meals were procured from the same source and consist of the same
menu.
6.29. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.29.1. The flight deck area will be kept as uncluttered and orderly as possible for all flight
   and ground operations. Specifically:
       6.29.1.1. During engine start and ground operations, no items (checklist, charts, etc.)
       should be placed in a position that would prevent inspection of aircraft and engine
       instruments or switches.
       6.29.1.2. During flight, no items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed in a position that
       covers or hides any flight or engine instruments from the view of the PF.
       6.29.1.3. Publication kits, flight kits, and personal kits will not be placed where they may
       interfere with the flight controls or egress.

Section 6D—Departure

6.30. Departure Briefings and Procedures. Before initial takeoff, the PF will brief the aircrew
on the procedures to be followed during takeoff and departure, performance data, and intentions
in case of an emergency.
 46                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   6.30.1. Any crew member noting a safety of flight malfunction before rotate, refusal, or
   decision speed will state, ―REJECT‖ and give a brief description of the malfunction. The
   PIC will brief abort criteria prior to takeoff roll if not accomplished in the pre-brief.
6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered ―on time‖ if the aircraft is airborne
no later than 0.2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time. Early departures are authorized provided
local, down-range and aircrew impact are evaluated and no adverse effect will result.
6.32. Aircraft Control. A qualified evaluator, instructor, or mission pilot will be at a set of
flight controls during all phases of flight. When conducting single pilot operations, the PF will
occupy the left seat or seat designated by the AFM/POH.
6.33. Transponder/Aircraft Identification. If installed, operate Mode 4 IAW theater and
operational directives. Operational check of the Mode 4 will be made prior to takeoff (test
equipment permitting). The preferred and primary method of testing Mode 4 is with the ground
test set. Do not plan to penetrate the ADIZ without an operational Mode 4.
   6.33.1. Ground and in-flight checks are mandatory maintenance debrief items. Crews will
   annotate any failure or unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4 in the aircraft forms. Units
   will develop procedures for accomplishing the Mode 4 ground check. The check should be
   coordinated between aircrew and maintenance during the aircraft preflight.
   6.33.2. Interrogation Friend or Foe (IFF) modes 1, 2, 3A and S codes are not classified and
   may be left set in the transponder. IFF Mode 4 codes will be zeroized before leaving the
   aircraft for extended periods of time.

Section 6E—En route

6.34. En route Briefings and Procedures. Conduct in-flight briefings, as necessary, to cover
any unusual circumstances and when flight safety or other conditions require the nonstandard
accomplishment of any maneuver.
6.35. Flight Progress. Use all available navigation aids to maintain course centerline and a
positive fix on the aircraft‘s position. When conducting navigation using a GPS for primary
navigation or autopilot flight coupling, the pilots will also use appropriate navigation aids (e.g.,
VHF Omnidirectional Range [VOR]) to maintain a positive fix on the aircraft‘s position.
6.36. Crew Duties and Responsibilities.
   6.36.1. Change of Aircraft Control. The change of aircraft or flight controls will be
   accomplished using a positive change of controls. Use the statement ―Pilot/Copilot has
   controls‖ to transfer control. The other pilot will acknowledge the change of aircraft control
   by stating ―Pilot/Copilot has controls‖.
   6.36.2. On two pilot crews, the PNF should be the primary crew member responsible for
   executing emergency checklist procedures. Normally, the PF will manipulate the power
   lever, condition lever, and/or manual override lever. The PF maintains aircraft control and
   reacts appropriately. The PF will confirm any switches prior to being actuated and will
   reference the checklist for guidance during the emergency. The PNF should review the POH
   as appropriate and as time permits.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                               47


   6.36.3. Interphone Communications. Limit interphone conversations to those essential for
   crew coordination. Do not discuss classified information on interphone during radio
   transmissions.
   6.36.4. All crew members will monitor aircraft interphone prior to engine start. Clearance is
   required from the PIC prior to an aircrew member removing headset. The aircrew member
   will advise the PIC when they have resumed monitoring the aircraft interphone.
   6.36.5. Command or Mission Radios. Normally, the PF should use and monitor only one
   ATC radio plus GUARD. Monitoring two ATC controlling agency‘s transmissions
   simultaneously is not recommended. This does not preclude establishing contact or
   conducting a radio check on another frequency.
   6.36.6. The PIC or designated aircrew member operating the command or mission radios
   will inform the crew which radio is primary. All crew members will monitor the primary
   command radio unless specifically directed otherwise by the PIC.
   6.36.7. Record and read back all ATC clearances except when ATC instructions require
   immediate execution and read back would interfere with the timely performance of aircrew
   duties.
   6.36.8. During emergencies, monitor simultaneous ultrahigh frequency (UHF) and very high
   frequency (VHF) transmissions, if able, when operating in a terminal area under radar
   control.
6.37. Radar Advisories. Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or
simulated IFR conditions.
6.38. Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) and
Other Reports. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Report all vital intelligence
sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP Planning or FIH.
   6.38.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air-to-ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and type of harassment. Request a relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.38.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Publication 6V5 and AFI 10-
   206, Operational Reporting.
6.39. In-Flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as
a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, and
this instruction.
   6.39.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency procedure checklist or critical action procedures, furnish the controlling
   agency a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any
   further pertinent information.
   6.39.2. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
 48                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft,
   if a turnaround is required.
   6.39.3. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical
   care, the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical
   personnel may meet the aircraft. The request will include the individual‘s gender,
   approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.40. Approach Lighting System (ALS) Inoperative. Increase the published visibility
minimums of an instrument approach by stated criteria in NOTAMs, ATIS information, or as
depicted on the approach procedure, when the runway ALS is inoperative. This applies only to
the ALS itself, not other lights which are not a component of the ALS (e.g., VASI, PAPI). If no
other guidance is provided, increase the published visibility by 1/2 mile.
6.41. Arrival. Before starting each approach, the PF will brief the procedures to be followed
during approach, landing, and go-around/missed approach, as necessary. Performance data will
be reviewed. This briefing should be accomplished prior to the completion of the Before
Landing Checklist.
   6.41.1. Minimum Fuel is reserve fuel and Emergency Fuel is fuel consumption at Long
   Range Cruise power setting 15 minutes after Minimum Fuel. Pilots will declare ―Minimum
   Fuel‖ or ―Emergency Fuel‖ to the ATC when they expect to land with less than the
   respective value and the pilot has not been given an approach or landing clearance.
6.42. Radar Altimeter Procedures.
   6.42.1. During VFR operations, the recommended low altitude warning setting is 90 percent
   of intended or flown cruise altitude.
   6.42.2. For instrument approaches, set the radar altimeter low altitude warning to the
   appropriate height above touchdown (HAT) or height above aerodrome (HAA) prior to the
   final approach fix (FAF).
6.43. Holding Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, aircrew are authorized to hold for one hour in lieu of an
alternate for remote or island destinations. Aircrew will comply with additional requirements
listed in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules.
6.44. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.44.1. Weather Below Minimums. If the reported ceiling is below the minimum for the
   approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an
   en route descent and approach, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route
   descent and approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                  49


   6.44.2. Circling Minimums. NSAv aircraft are considered Category B if not defined in
   applicable AFM/POH. The PF may fly circling approaches at higher speeds raising the
   circling minimums to the category for the speed to be flown. The PF is responsible for
   briefing speeds and flying the approach according to the correct minimums.

Section 6G—After Landing

6.45. Maintenance. Complete aircraft maintenance forms after each flight.
   6.45.1. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and any aircrew member documenting a
   maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and
   subsystems. The PIC or aircrew member noting a discrepancy will document the problem in
   the aircraft maintenance forms. At locations where there is no maintenance personnel and
   maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the
   MC or command post prior to entering crew rest.
6.46. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a ground or in-flight incident, the PIC should
impound the aircraft immediately and contact the squadron CC, DO, MC or appropriate
controlling agency for further instructions.
6.47. Clearwater Rinse Facility (Birdbath). Aircrews will not use Clearwater Rinse facilities
in order to prevent damage to the aircraft. If required, exceptions to this paragraph will be
placed in the aircraft specific addendum.
   6.47.1. An entry will be placed in the aircraft maintenance forms, ―Aircraft Subjected to Salt
   Spray‖ anytime the aircraft is flown over salt water below 1,000 feet AGL, except for
   takeoffs and landings. Document the lowest altitude and duration the aircraft was subjected
   to salt spray.
6.48. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections.
   6.48.1. Complete customs, agriculture, and public health clearance forms, as required, prior
   to opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel.
   6.48.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection
   for processing at those stations where federal or local inspections are required. The PIC or
   designated representative should complete the necessary forms before reporting to inspectors.
   6.48.3. After clearing with border clearance agencies, the PIC or designated representative
   will return to the aircraft for off-loading and other post-flight procedures.
   6.48.4. A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument. When cleared to over-fly or land in
   foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
   or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
   cargo on board. The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises
   of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or
   the American Embassy in the country concerned.
 50                                                AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   6.48.5. PIC will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign
   government. If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the
   senior AFSOC or USAF representative or US Embassy or consulate within the host nation.
   Inform customs or other officials of the above policy and request that they confirm their
   request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives. If
   necessary, the aircrew will seal the aircraft and enter into crew rest, and relay departure
   intentions, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Use communications by
   the fastest means available to inform command and control facilities should this situation
   occur.
   6.48.6. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
   consider the following procedures:
      6.48.6.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC to the
      foreign officials that the aircraft is a sovereign instrument not subject to search without
      consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be
      clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may
      honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
      6.48.6.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to
      delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/A3OFN or the appropriate
      embassy (US or other friendly nation). The PIC should unequivocally state, the aircrew
      has no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to
      these agencies for decision. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the foreign
      request by the most expeditious means available. Thereafter, the PIC should follow
      instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
      6.48.6.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
      indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical
      considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission for immediate departure.
      6.48.6.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
      on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action being
      pursued and that he intends to notify both HQ USAF and the US Embassy of the foreign
      action. The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on board the aircraft, without
      physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and the US Embassy
      as soon as possible.
   6.48.7. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
   equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the
   foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.
6.49. Crew Debriefing/Post-mission Actions.
   6.49.1. Training Missions. The PIC will conduct the debriefing session and complete the
   appropriate documentation. The PIC will ensure all applicable information is passed to
   controlling agencies.
   6.49.2. Combat Operations. Each aircrew participating in operations under actual combat
   conditions will participate in an intelligence and mission debriefing session.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                51


   6.49.3. The squadron CC or MC will ensure that all aircrews are debriefed immediately
   following a combat or combat support mission during which any tactics or procedures were
   observed that may affect other operations.
   6.49.4. PIC encountering hostile fire will submit an immediate airborne report to their
   controlling agency followed by a hostile fire incident report to intelligence immediately after
   landing.
       6.49.5. Other Missions. The PIC has the responsibility of affording each crew member
       the opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission. Debriefings may be formal or
       informal, as the situation requires.
   6.49.6. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a point of contact with the base
   operations or FBO for overnight billeting. The PIC will be immediately notified in the case
   of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.

Section 6H—Miscellaneous

6.50. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202, Volume
3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules. For electronic devices not listed, the user will provide
the aircrew a letter from the Aeronautical Systems Division, Deputy for Engineering
(ASC/ENAE) certifying the device is approved for airborne use. If the aircrew detects any
interference from an electronic device used aboard the aircraft, discontinue the use of this device
for the duration of the flight.
6.51. Jamming and Interference. All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the
procedures for reporting incidents of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) or
Spectrum Interference (SI). Info copy HQ AFSOC/A3TW on all MIJI/SI reports.
6.52. Passenger Guidance. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria
for passenger movement on DoD aircraft. AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1, Aviation Management,
provides further guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications
directly. In all cases, passengers will be manifested on DD Form 96, Passenger Manifest.
   6.52.1. During spouse orientation flights, threat reaction maneuvers are prohibited and
   spouses will not fly together on the same aircraft.
   6.52.2. For other orientation categories, passengers will be seated with seatbelts fastened
   during threat maneuvers.
   6.52.3. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not
   previously mentioned, who are authorized official travel on DoD aircraft. The OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF will determine and approve eligibility for all space required categories.
   Reference Table 5.1 and AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1, Aviation Management, for more
   information.
6.53. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. Generally, before
transporting civilian law enforcement officials or civilian medical personnel, obtain proper
authorization through OG/CC or COMAFSOF. Civilian law enforcement or medical personnel
may be required to perform duties at an accident site. These duties may include death
determination or human remains removal. Local and international laws may affect mission
prosecution and should be reviewed prior to deployment or pickup of civilian personnel.
 52                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


Commanders will not transport civilian law enforcement personnel into areas of imminent
danger or where confrontation with civilian criminal targets is likely, will not use military force
against civilian criminal targets unless in self defense, and will not direct the action of civilian
authorities in enforcing the law or making arrests.
6.54. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term ―hazardous material‖ includes any material,
which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or property.
Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.1, 1.2,
or 1.3 explosives, Department of Transportation (DoT) Class A and B poisons, etiological or
biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.
Also included are DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases,
flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.
   6.54.1. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military
   Air Shipment.
   6.54.2. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper‘s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
   6.54.3. Flight Planning. The PIC (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
       6.54.3.1. Enters ―Hazardous Cargo‖ and the mission number in the appropriate section of
       the flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, information
       section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan Form.
       6.54.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize over-flying heavily populated or otherwise critical
       areas.
       6.54.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
       should include the following:
           6.54.3.3.1. DoT class and DoD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous
           material on board (include net weight of DoT Class A or B poisons and net explosive
           weight of Class A or B explosives).
           6.54.3.3.2. Request for special support (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
           escort teams, etc.).
           6.54.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
       6.54.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at
       destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone.
   6.54.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
   parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the firefighting agency has
   the hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the
   firefighting agency:
       6.54.4.1. DoT class of hazardous material on board and the DoD hazard class or division
       for explosive material on board.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                               53


     6.54.4.2. Net Explosive Weight.
     6.54.4.3. Request for isolated parking (if necessary).
     6.54.4.4. Estimated time of departure.
  6.54.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply.         Avoid flying over heavily populated or
  otherwise critical areas.
  6.54.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
  theater commander or FLIP planning:
     6.54.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
     other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
     announce that hazardous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base
     support agencies have received the departure message. If not, transmit the mission
     number, ETA, and information.
     6.54.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
     information to the nearest FAA flight service station.
     6.54.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
     airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support agencies.
  6.54.7. Parking:
     6.54.7.1. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
     explosives, DoT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
     in areas isolated from personnel. PIC‘s are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
     identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
     area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
     acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host
     procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such
     occurrences.
     6.54.7.2. The military host is responsible for ensuring aircraft are properly placarded. For
     non-military installations, the briefing to the PIC will include placard requirements and, if
     required, placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper must make prior
     arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring
     placards. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, firefighting procedures, and
     isolated parking requirements.
  6.54.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to IFE. Transmit unclassified information to the
  appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
     6.54.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
     6.54.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
     6.54.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
     6.54.8.4. Fuel on board.
     6.54.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
     information.
 54                                                AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       6.54.8.6. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the AFSOC Command Center or theater
       CC by telephone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials
       information, and other pertinent information as required.
6.55. Hazardous Medical Equipment.
   6.55.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment
   are of major concern:
       6.55.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference which is
       commonly beyond the limits specified by Military Standard (MIL STD) 461A and 462,
       and therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
       6.55.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
       A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
       regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.55.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.55.2.1. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must inform the PIC when
       nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
       6.55.2.2. The PIC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
       during the mission.
       6.55.2.3. The PIC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
       navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
       6.55.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
       the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
       additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
       navigational equipment.
   6.55.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.55.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axes.
       6.55.3.2. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must continually monitor the
       operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.56. Narcotics. Aircrew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled onboard the aircraft. Maintain narcotics that are part of official medical kits in
accordance with appropriate directives.
6.57. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered and the mission is continued, the PIC will:
   6.57.1. Ensure documentation is entered into the aircraft maintenance forms.
   6.57.2. Notify the controlling agency as soon as practical. Include route of flight, altitude,
   and weather conditions encountered.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                               55


                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security on the ground and in-flight.
AFSOC NSAv aircraft are Protection Level 4 resources in CONUS and PL3 while OCONUS.
This security priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located,
worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per
DoD 5200.1-R, and AFI 31-401.
7.2. Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft when
located away from US military installations. AFJI 31-102, Physical Security, covers security
arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other US military installations.
Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected
locations. If US military security forces are not available, the US embassy assigned to that
country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For missions involving a
planning agency, the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the planned security
measures conform to mission requirements. The amount of security required will vary,
depending on location and ground time.
   7.2.1. For nonpermissive or uncertain environments, airfield and LZ security is the
   responsibility of the agency requesting support. Crew will work with the agency requesting
   support to insure security meets the requirement for the mission.
   7.2.2. For permissive environments, the PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates en route, if required. When landing at DoD component installations, the installation
   commander is responsible for providing adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and the PIC will use Table 7.1. to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-US military
   installations overseas and civilian airfields. NOTE: Aircrews possess the training to provide
   the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. For unscheduled or emergency landings
   at non-USAF installations, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the
   following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:
       7.2.2.1. Aircrew surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrews are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed crew
       members to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and
       activities in the aircraft vicinity.
       7.2.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
       back-up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
       Form 15.
       7.2.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
       unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions and depart as soon as possible for a
       destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the location due to system
       malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case,
       will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be
       subordinate to aircraft security when the aircraft may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a
56                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


     security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until
     relief is available. The PIC will coordinate through appropriate C2 channels to acquire
     additional security.
     7.2.2.4. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be
     impractical at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other
     factors. For example, some countries don't allow armed security personnel. On other
     deployments, the mission may rely on maintaining a low profile and attracting as little
     attention as possible. At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique
     requirements when necessary. As a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches. If it
     is not possible to lock aircraft, secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to
     indicate unauthorized entry (i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals). The PIC is
     the final authority for determining tailored security measures. Contact with US Embassy
     personnel is required at locations where security agreements are not in existence.
  7.2.3. Ground security teams. Ground security teams may be considered to guard the
  aircraft for planned overnight stops. Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to
  the PIC at all times. The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing,
  aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate. The flying squadron commander is
  the final approval authority for the need of ground security teams for their aircraft and
  authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.
     7.2.3.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
     Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, at all times when carrying weapons,
     ammunition, and equipment onboard the aircraft.
     7.2.3.2. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, ground security teams
     will keep their weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if
     the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons
     be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior
     to deployment.
  7.2.4. Unauthorized Entry. At the discretion of the PIC, the aircraft should be locked and
  sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry.
     7.2.4.1. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that
     will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles to the
     airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal doors using a metal boxcar
     seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry. Wipe the immediate area
     around the seal to help investigate forced entry. If the seals are damaged or have been
     tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and
     inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
     7.2.4.2. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
     servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
     may be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
     personnel if required.
  7.2.5. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
  always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
  During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas to include aircraft wheel-
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                 57


   wells, air-conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.3. Aircraft Security Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will use this
matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix will be
used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.
A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are
adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. The squadron or mission
commander may consider additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than
90, commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The squadron or
mission commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC.
EXCEPTION: During unscheduled or emergency landings, the PIC is the final approval
authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the US Embassy or US Defense Attaché
Office (USDAO) for security assistance. NOTE: Normally, additional security for the aircraft is
not required at military installations within a NATO country or US civilian airfields approved by
the FAA/Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

 TOTAL POINTS:
 Notes:
 1. Derive the local threat from valid intelligence sources only.
 2. ―Adequate lighting‖ is equal to the illumination provided by one standard USAF light cart.
 3. If a security response team and security patrols are not present, commanders should
 consider deploying or contracting security personnel.
7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors (DV). This
paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above. The PIC is
responsible for aircraft security at en route stops.
   7.4.1. DoD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.
7.5. Arming of Crew members. The squadron CC, DO, or MC may direct arming of crew
members as deemed necessary by mission threat analysis. Protect all weapons IAW AFI 31-207,
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons
Handling Manual.
   7.5.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain
   weapons, ammunition, lock, and key. Crew members must present a current AF Form 523,
   USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crew members will be
   reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crew
   member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew
   member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                  59


   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and
   from the command post, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such
   as base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack
   bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage. Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or on-load
   duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons
   may be stored in the gun box in-flight. If no gun box is available retain weapon for the
   duration of the flight. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be
   unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
       7.5.5.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
       overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
       nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military
       services armories, US National Guard and Reserve armories, US civil law enforcement
       armories, and US Embassies. If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons
       security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters.
       One crew member will remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the
       ammunition over to the PIC.
7.6. General Antihijacking Guidance. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist
an aircraft hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to direct physical
confrontation, including the use of deadly force IAW CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules of
Engagement/Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, and all applicable ROE/RUF.
Due to the sensitive nature of antihijacking procedures, crew members should reference. AFI
13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO) and the FIH for specific guidance.
Aircrews will not release any information concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts.
Antihijacking is a crew duty performed exclusively by aircrew personnel. The hijacking of an
AFSOC aircraft could create a serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of
passengers and property. An aircraft is most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the
aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are
mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a
deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and
property. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the
problem.
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct antihijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the aircraft
   commander is fully satisfied with these inspections.
EXCEPTION: Supporting/supported forces may be antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the
aircrew.
 60                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       7.6.1.1. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible
       for the antihijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by
       civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
       7.6.1.2. Contingency and exercise movements. During contingencies in support of
       combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel,
       the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections.
   7.6.2. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers (including MEP) will not carry weapons and/or
   ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft.

EXCEPTION: Special agents/guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other
individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons in coordination with the PIC. In all cases,
the crew will be aware of the location of weapons and ammunition.
       7.6.2.1. If individuals must clear their weapons before boarding the aircraft, and access
       to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to:
           7.6.2.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
           personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons.
           7.6.2.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
   7.6.3. Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on the
   aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC.
EXCEPTION: During combat operations, troops may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition
on board the aircraft. When the tactical situation dictates, personnel who will engage an enemy
force immediately upon deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons on board the
aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader with the PIC‘s concurrence.
Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.
7.7. Specific Antihijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crew members are familiar with
the ground and in-flight resistance actions and forced penetration of unfriendly airspace
procedures in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), and the FIH. In
the event of a hijacking, crew members must act immediately and resourcefully, without
instruction, in order to counter the attacker successfully.

                                            Chapter 8

                                  MISSION EMPLOYMENT

8.1. Terminal Operations.
   8.1.1. Takeoff Procedures. Compute aircraft performance data prior to departure if
   personnel, equipment, or fuel have been on/off-loaded.
   8.1.2. If any degradation in onboard systems is discovered which could result in loss of
   situational awareness during approach, the PIC will inform the crew. The decision to
   proceed rests with the PIC.
   8.1.3. Go-around Calls. If any crew member calls ―Go-around‖ the PF will immediately
   apply power to establish a climb that clears all obstacles. Minimum altitude for overflight of
   aircraft, equipment, or personnel on the runway is 500 feet AGL.
8.2. Tactical Operations. Execute the proper tactical procedure based upon threat analysis and
aircraft performance. For all tactical operations, follow theater specific ATC procedures to avoid
potential conflicts.
   8.2.1. Radio Communication. The PIC will plan and brief individual responsibilities for
   secure communication loading, voice radio configuration and communication during the
   mission. Coordination between all aircrew members is essential for safe and effective
   mission accomplishment. All aircrew members that have the capability to monitor radios
   must be alert to back up the assigned crew members when duties allow. The PIC will assign
   radio monitoring and transmission duties after examining each phase of flight for mission
   requirements and individual workload.
   8.2.2. Preparation for NVG Operations. Cockpit and cabin lights may be taped or covered
   with NVG compatible film if they will interfere with NVG operations and cannot be
   otherwise disabled without removing aircraft power (e.g., pulling circuit breakers). Landing
   gear indicators will not be covered with tape.
   8.2.3. Tactical Departures.
       8.2.3.1. Spiral Departure.      Using Maximum Climb Power settings and aircraft
       configuration IAW the AFM/POH, climb at best rate of climb speed (VY) while turning
       the aircraft to remain inside the secure area above or around the airfield. Use no more
       than 30 degrees of bank. If the aircraft cannot be kept in the secure area or obstacles are
       a factor, climb at best angle of climb speed (VX) while still maintaining no more than 30
       degrees of bank. If able, climb to cruise altitude or an altitude above the threat before
       departing the secure area.
       8.2.3.2. Low Departure. Use the entire runway available in order to depart the secure
       perimeter of the airfield at the highest possible speed and at the highest altitude the threat
       will allow. Place the aircraft in a clean configuration as soon as possible after liftoff. Set
       maximum continuous climb power settings (IAW AFM/POH) after the aircraft is in a
       clean configuration. Once clear of the threat, immediately climb to cruise altitude.
   8.2.4. Tactical Arrivals.
 62                                                AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


      8.2.4.1. Random Steep Approach. Reference specific aircraft addendum and tactical
      guides for more information.
      8.2.4.2. Random Shallow Approach. Reference specific aircraft addendum and tactical
      guides for more information.
      8.2.4.3. Maximum Rate Descent Approach. Reference specific aircraft addendum and
      tactical guides for more information.
8.3. Aircraft Navigation Systems.
   8.3.1. GPS approaches. The PIC will ensure the aircraft flown is approved to use GPS for en
   route operations, terminal procedures to include area navigation (RNAV) arrivals and
   departures, and RNAV instrument approach to the RNAV published approach minimums
   prior to commencing GPS or RNAV procedures. Aircraft certified to conduct lateral
   navigation/vertical navigations (LNAV/VNAV) may perform LNAV/VNAV approaches
   IAW GPS navigational systems manuals. Aircraft certified to conduct only lateral navigation
   (LNAV) approaches may conduct LNAV approaches IAW the GPS navigational systems
   manuals. Consult aircraft specific navigation equipment operating manuals for specific
   operating guidance and certification.
   8.3.2. Self-contained Approaches. Although some GPS or FMS navigation systems enable
   approaches and pseudo approaches to be constructed and flown, these type approaches may
   only be used as a situational awareness aid and may not be used as the sole means of
   navigating to a runway or LZ in IMC. Unless GPS ―Overlay‖ requirements in AFI 11-202,
   Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, are met, aircrews must fly under normal
   VFR or theater specific VFR guidance, whichever is more restrictive.
WARNING: Self-constructed approaches and pseudo approaches do not guarantee obstacle or
terrain clearance.
8.4. Combat Entry/Exit Criteria.
   8.4.1. The ―FENCE‖ acronym can be used to help aircrew prepare the aircraft prior to entry
   into and exit from combat operations. These procedures may be modified as the situation
   and aircraft requires. If an aircraft does not have a specific combat entry/exit checklist, the
   normal aircraft checklists will be used for all operations and it is incumbent on the PIC to
   ensure that all checklist items appropriate to the mission are accomplished and safety is
   maximized. Use the ―FENCE‖ acronym after passing the combat exit point to aid in
   configuring the aircraft for normal flight operations.
      8.4.1.1. F – Fuel. Check fuel balance and quantity. The PIC will establish a BINGO
      fuel to ensure the aircraft arrives at destination or alternate with required fuel reserves
      IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, and this instruction.
      8.4.1.2. E – Engine(s)/Electrics. Check electrical system for normal operation, to
      include all generators, battery, and inverters as applicable. Check all engine gauges for
      normal indications. Confirm TOLD and aircraft performance will allow for safe aircraft
      and mission operations. Recommended technique of setting 3,000 feet AGL above
      intended arrival into the aircraft pressurization system (not to exceed 10,000 cabin
      altitude) to ensure the aircraft is depressurized prior to landing.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                    63


       8.4.1.3. N – Navigation. Set-up required navigational equipment (navigational and
       aircraft performance instruments, GPS, traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS),
       Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), radar altimeters, etc.) as
       required to increase situational and positional awareness for mission. If altimeter setting
       below transition altitude or level is unknown for mission/objective area, set the highest
       altimeter setting reported for the area until obtaining an accurate altimeter setting.
       8.4.1.4. C – Communications. Set the communication radios and systems as required.
       The PIC will outline aircrew radio responsibilities and configurations for the mission
       requirements.
       8.4.1.5. E – Emitters. Consider emission devices that are not essential to navigation or
       safety, but may pose a threat to the detection of the aircraft. Consider minimal
       operational settings for systems like the transponder, weather radar, VORs, distance
       measuring equipment (DME), etc. Turn off interior and exterior lights that are not
       needed for safety or distracting under NVGs. Although a passive detection system, set
       the aircraft defensive systems, if applicable, to comply with theater directives while
       providing aircrew with the greatest amount of threat detection and protection.
   8.4.2. Complete combat exit criteria using the ―FENCE‖ acronym in reverse order once the
   aircraft has departed the combat environment or upon mission completion to aid in flight
   safety when not in the combat (simulated or actual) environment.
8.5. Austere Landing Zone Operations. Only fully mission qualified aircrews or those
receiving instruction are authorized to operate in accordance with this section. Use normal
takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical.
   8.5.1. Landing Zone Assessment. Mission operations may necessitate changes. Carefully
   evaluate aircraft capabilities and the mission environment before the operation. Consider the
   following:
       8.5.1.1. Security of the operating area.
       8.5.1.2. Terrain and obstacle features along the approach or departure path.
       8.5.1.3. Runway surface conditions (e.g., dirt, grass, dust, small holes, damaged Pierced
       Steel Plank (PSP), smooth, rough, etc.).
       8.5.1.4. Surface temperature and density altitude.
       8.5.1.5. Usable runway length and width.
       8.5.1.6. Surface acceleration and deceleration factors (e.g., soft, dry, wet, ice, slope).
       8.5.1.7. Actual and predicted gross weight of aircraft.
       8.5.1.8. Surface winds (e.g., headwind, tailwind, crosswinds, gusty, turbulence).
       8.5.1.9. Number of takeoffs and landings required.
       8.5.1.10. Ground Plan (e.g., ERO, vehicles, marshalling, on/off-load locations, etc.).
8.6. Arrival. Plan arrival altitudes to minimize conflict with terrain or other airborne traffic.
 64                                                   AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


8.7. Traffic Pattern. When the environment permits, fly normal traffic patterns. Terrain may
require significant modifications to normal traffic patterns. Options are to enter the traffic pattern
via an initial, downwind, base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the runway.
8.8. Specific Aircrew Procedures. The following procedures are recommended in addition to
the normal procedures in the AFM/POH:
   8.8.1. Close the engine bleed valves (if equipped) as required.
   8.8.2. During the final stage of landing roll, reduce reverse thrust, if conditions permit, to
   prevent debris from causing a restriction to visibility or engine damage.
   8.8.3. Do not land if the LZ is not properly identified or an abort signal is given.
   8.8.4. Brief the ground party and subsequent aircrews on any unexpected hazards
   encountered during takeoff or landing.
8.9. Combat Loading. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat off-
load, passenger combat loading, and rapid infiltration.
   8.9.1. Combat Off-load Training. No special authorization is required for combat off-load
   training using unilateral training loads. Squadron DOV will develop specific procedures for
   combat off-load for aircraft capable of that operation.
   8.9.2. Passenger Combat Loading. All personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated
   and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform. Use either personal
   restraining devices or aircraft tie-down straps.
       8.9.2.1. When airlifting litter patients, position the litters longitudinally with patients‘
       heads aft (or as recommended by medical personnel) and secure each of the litters with a
       tie-down strap.
       8.9.2.2. For one litter: hook the tie-down strap into a floor ring, run laterally, wrapping
       the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the nearest tie-down ring,
       and tighten.
       8.9.2.3. For two litters side by side: use two tie-down straps for each end hooked into
       tie-down rings, run the straps laterally, one left and one right, over each outboard litter
       handle to the nearest tie-down ring, and tighten.
       8.9.2.4. For three litters side by side: wrap the straps around adjacent handles.
   8.9.3. Rapid Infiltration Procedures. These procedures are only authorized when conducting
   infiltration and/or exfiltration operations with Special Operations Forces. In addition to the
   guidance provided here, crews should follow the guidance in the AFTTP for C-130 and
   HC/MC-130 operations as applicable. All personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated
   and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform. Troops will provide
   their own restraining devices. If troops do not provide personal restraining devices, secure
   personnel using passenger combat loading procedures. See aircraft specific addendum for
   further guidance.
       8.9.3.1. The Loadmaster may use IR chemical lights taped to illuminate inside of a
       blacked out cargo compartment if required.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                65


       8.9.3.2. The loadmaster or additional crew member will notify personnel at 60 minutes,
       30 minutes, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 1 Minute, and immediately prior to
       landing by stating ―XX minute(s)‖. Give a ―Prepare to Land‖ advisory when minimums
       have been called.
       8.9.3.3. Loadmasters may wear NVGs during blacked out operations. Loadmasters
       should wear NVGs on aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting; however, the NVGs may
       be raised when NVG lighting is operational and provides sufficient illumination for task
       accomplishment.
       8.9.3.4. Procedures after Touchdown. For aircraft equipped with a rear cargo ramp and
       door. These procedure should be performed by a qualified loadmaster but may be
       performed by a trained crew member.
           8.9.3.4.1. Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the pilot states, ―CLEAR
           TO OPEN‖ or as pre-briefed. Lower the ramp to the ground once the aircraft has
           stopped and the pilot states ―CLEAR TO OFF-LOAD.‖
CAUTION: Maintain positive control of ground loading ramps (if used).
           8.9.3.4.2. Position ground loading ramps (if used).
NOTE: If a time delay before onloading is anticipated, raise the ramp enough to allow the
aircraft to taxi in the event of an emergency.
           8.9.3.4.3. Complete on/off-load.
           8.9.3.4.4. Raise ground loading ramps (if used).
           8.9.3.4.5. Raise the ramp to horizontal.
           8.9.3.4.6. Notify the pilot, ―CLEAR TO TAXI‖.
           8.9.3.4.7. Secure ground loading ramps (if used).
           8.9.3.4.8. Close the ramp and door.
           8.9.3.4.9. Turn on the red or NVG compatible lights (if applicable).
           8.9.3.4.10. Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles and/or equipment and exits are secure,
           and warning lights are extinguished.
           8.9.3.4.11. If the aircraft is equipped, connect/engage aerial delivery system (ADS)
           arms after takeoff as soon as mission requirements allow.
           8.9.3.4.12. Check vehicle tie-downs and secure cargo compartment after takeoff as
           soon as mission requirements allow.
       8.9.3.5. Procedures after Touchdown. For aircraft not equipped with a rear cargo ramp
       and door. These operations should be performed by a qualified loadmaster but may be
       performed by a trained crew member.
           8.9.3.5.1. Open and lock the side door(s) when the pilot states, ―CLEAR TO OPEN‖.
WARNING: The pilot will not clear any side exits to be opened until the aircraft is slowed to a
safe taxi speed. Side exits forward of any landing gear or propellers will not be opened until the
aircraft is stopped.
 66                                              AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


          8.9.3.5.2. When aircraft is stopped and the pilot states "CLEAR TO ON/OFF-
          LOAD" the loadmaster or trained aircrew member will complete off-load/onload.
          8.9.3.5.3. Notify the pilot, ―CLEAR TO TAXI‖.
          8.9.3.5.4. Close the side door.
          8.9.3.5.5. Prior to takeoff, ensure the vehicles, equipment, cargo, passengers, and
          exits are secure, and warning lights are extinguished.
          8.9.3.5.6. Secure cargo compartment after takeoff as soon as mission requirements
          allow.
8.10. CASEVAC. NSAv aircraft and aircrew are not equipped or trained for MEDEVAC
missions. NSAv aircrew and aircraft are not normally used for CASEVAC alerts due to weight
and equipment constraints. If an in extremis CASEVAC is required, a Paramedic Level or
higher trained medical provider should be onboard.
   8.10.1. Aircraft configuration. If required the aircraft will be reconfigured IAW the
   POH/AFM. Consider removing carpets and covering the floor with some type of barrier to
   contain body fluids and medical waste. The crew will accomplish weight and balance for the
   new configuration.
   8.10.2. Medical hazards. Take all necessary precautions to keep the crew and aircraft
   isolated from medical hazards.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                   67


                                            Chapter 9

                                           TRAINING

9.1. General. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, and the NSAv specific Volume 1,
NSAv Aircrew Training, for additional information.
9.2. Training Aircraft Not Capable of Flight. If an aircraft is not capable of departure within
4 hours after scheduled departure time, cancel the training mission unless waived by the PIC.
Departure consists of actual takeoffs for assigned or planned training missions and does not
include maintenance ops checks.
9.3. Air Combat Maneuver Training. Pilots will make advisory calls to the aircrew prior to
beginning the evasive maneuver. Crew members will clear the aircraft of obstacles throughout
the maneuvering.
9.4. Not Used.
9.5. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   9.5.1. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device is not authorized for any
   phase of flight.
   9.5.2. Initiate practice instrument missed approaches no lower than the minimum altitude for
   the approach being flown.
9.6. Confidence Maneuvers. All confidence maneuvers will be accomplished in VMC
conditions under VFR with a discernable horizon. Ensure the airspace around the aircraft is clear
of traffic by visually clearing the area prior to the maneuver. Do not exceed POH/AFM
limitations. See aircraft specific addendum for additional guidance.
   9.6.1. Stall Series. Begin stall series at least 5,000 feet AGL or 5,000 feet above the clouds
   if operating ―VFR on top.‖ For stall series training, recover from the stall at the first definite
   indication (e.g., stick shaker, actual stall of aircraft, decay of control effectiveness). An IP at
   a set of flight controls is required to perform this maneuver.
       9.6.1.1. Power Off Stalls. Determine actual stall speeds prior to maneuver. The stall may
       be entered from either straight or turning flight in the approach and landing configuration.
       Initiate recovery at the pre-briefed point, if engine revolutions per minute (RPM) decay is
       detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered.
       9.6.1.2. Power On Stalls. Determine actual stall speeds prior to maneuver. In some high
       performance aircraft, the power setting for power on stalls may have to be reduced below
       takeoff power to prevent excessive high pitch attitudes (greater than 30 degrees nose up).
       In the absence of a manufacturer recommended power setting, use no more than
       approximately 55-60 percent of full power as a guideline. The stall should be entered in
       the takeoff or departure configuration and at an airspeed no lower than reference speed
       (VREF) for the aircraft configuration. Initiate recovery at the pre-briefed point, if engine
       RPM decay is detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered.
           9.6.1.2.1. In multiengine aircraft, simulated or actual engine-out, power-on stalls are
           prohibited.
 68                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


CAUTION: There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine
inoperative minimum control speed.
   9.6.2. Steep Turns. Accomplish steep turns at least 1,500 feet AGL, 1,500 feet above the
   clouds if operating ―VFR on top,‖ or the manufacturer's recommended altitude, whichever is
   higher. Accomplish both 45 and 60 degree bank steep turns. Do not exceed 60 degrees of
   bank.
   9.6.3. Spins. Intentional spins in NSAv aircraft are prohibited unless required for training in
   acrobatic certified aircraft.
   9.6.4. Slow Flight. Fly an airspeed 5 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) below VREF for
   aircraft configuration. Do not exceed 15 degrees of bank. Authorized in day VMC only at a
   minimum of 1,500 feet AGL or 1,500 feet above a clouds if operating ―VFR on top.‖
   9.6.5. Aerobatics. Acrobatics in NSAv aircraft is prohibited unless training in aerobatic
   certified aircraft.
   9.6.6. Minimum Control Airspeed (VMCA) Demonstration. Stall speed and engine
   inoperative minimum control airspeed should be determined prior to flight. Authorized in
   day VMC only, at a minimum altitude so that recovery is completed by 5,000 feet AGL,
   5,000 feet above the cloud deck, or the manufacturer's recommended altitude, whichever is
   higher. Initiate recovery at the first recognition of loss of directional control by
   simultaneously reducing the power on the operating engine and/or reducing the angle of
   attack as necessary to regain directional control and airspeed. An IP at a set of flight control
   is required to perform this maneuver.
CAUTION: There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine
inoperative VMCA. When this density altitude exists below 5,000 AGL because of high
elevations, high temperatures, or both, an effective flight demonstration of loss of directional
control may be hazardous and should not be attempted. If it is determined prior to flight that the
stall speed is above or equal to VMCA, this flight demonstration is impracticable.
9.7. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
   9.7.1. Practice simulated emergencies which require placing switches in other than their
   normal position or the aircraft in an abnormal configuration as specified in the aircraft
   manual only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight
   examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats.
       9.7.1.1. IP candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight
       examiner pilot, not in the seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures during
       upgrade evaluations to IP.
       9.7.1.2. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate
       simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
       9.7.1.3. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit simulated
       emergencies to noncritical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency
       if a nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
       9.7.1.4. Do not perform simulated emergencies when passengers or medical crew
       members (except flight surgeons performing required flight duties) are on board.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                 69


   9.7.2. Simulated Engine Failure. Simulated engine failures will only be accomplished with
   an IP at a set of functional aircraft controls.
      9.7.2.1. Initiate simulated engine failure no lower than 200 feet AGL or approach
      minimums if during an instrument approach. The IP will initiate the emergency. The IP
      will set the power lever or throttle to a setting equivalent to a feathered propeller once the
      flying pilot correctly executes/applies the proper BOLDFACE, simulated emergency
      procedure, or critical action procedure.
          9.7.2.1.1. For multiengine aircraft, the simulated failed engine should be set to a zero
          thrust airspeed greater than best angle of climb single engine (VXSE) or VMCA + 5
          KIAS, whichever is higher.
      9.7.2.2. A go-around will be directed by the IP if a safe landing is not ensured.
          9.7.2.2.1. Single Engine Aircraft Simulated Engine Out Go-around or Missed
          Approach. At the direction of a go-around, the simulated emergency will be
          terminated and the PF will use power as required to safely climb away from the
          ground and clear all obstacles. The IP will direct a go-around during a simulated
          engine out approach at or above 100 feet AGL when the aircraft is not stabilized and
          aligned with the landing runway.
          9.7.2.2.2. Multiengine Aircraft Simulated Engine Out Go-around or Missed
          Approach. Initiate simulated engine out go-around or missed approach no lower than
          100 feet AGL or minimum altitude for the approach.
   9.7.3. Single Engine Aircraft Simulated Forced Landings. Simulated forced landings outside
   the airfield environment due to simulated engine malfunction/failure and other emergencies
   will only be accomplished in VMC under VFR. The IP will initiate the simulated emergency
   to practice a forced landing only in an area previously studied by the IP for hazards and
   obstacles. The IP will terminate the simulated forced landing and direct a go-around no
   lower than 100 feet AGL.
   9.7.4. The following guidance will be adhered to on multiengine aircraft during all engine
   out training:
      9.7.4.1. Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the operating
      engine(s).
      9.7.4.2. Turns into the simulated failed engine should be minimized. Turns into the
      simulated failed engine are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with
      actual failed engines and must be smooth and coordinated.
WARNING: Improper application of rudder or power can lead to an immediate out-of-control
situation where recovery might not be possible.
   9.7.5. Aborted Takeoff. Authorized during day or night VMC, or with NVGs. Crosswind
   component must not exceed 75% of the crosswind limitations listed in the aircraft
   AFM/POH. The runway must be dry, a minimum width of 400% aircraft wheel track, and
   long enough to meet normal takeoff distance requirements. Initiate the abort by stating
   ―REJECT‖ before rotation speed or V1, whichever is less.
 70                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   9.7.6. Actual Engine Shutdown and Air start. On multiengine aircraft, one engine may be
   shut down in day VMC only at a minimum of 5,000 feet above the ground or cloud deck,
   whichever is higher. Do not shut down the engine unless the aircraft can remain clear of
   clouds and recover and land under visual flight rules.
9.8. Touch-and-go/Stop-and-go Operations.
   9.8.1. Conduct touch-and-go operations IAW the AFM/POH or this instruction‘s checklists.
   Touch-and-go operations require two qualified pilots or an IP if the other pilot is unqualified
   or noncurrent.
      9.8.1.1. The touch-and-go checklists may be used when performing multiple instrument
      approaches or VFR pattern practice at the same airport or transitioning to another airport
      within 25 NM. Pilots will complete all normal checklists after the initial takeoff or when
      transiting to another airport greater that 25 NM from the airport where the instrument
      approach or VFR pattern practice was accomplished.
   9.8.2. Wet Runways. Stop-and-go or touch-and-go operations are prohibited when
   crosswinds exceed 75% of the crosswind limitations listed in the POH.
   9.8.3. Icy Runways. Stop-and-go or touch-and-go operations are prohibited on icy runways.
   9.8.4. Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 feet and ¾ mile (40).
9.9. NVG Operations. NVG training illumination requirements are the same as outlined in
Chapter 5. NVG instrument approach weather minimums are the minimums for the approach.

   11.1.6. Assist the pilot(s) by aligning and programming the navigation system when required
   for the mission.
   11.1.7. Monitor all aircraft systems for normal operation and immediately notify the pilot of
   any system that is not operating normally and take action as required.
   11.1.8. Back up the PF and PNF in monitoring airspeed, altitude, and heading. Immediately
   notify the PF if these parameters are different than those briefed by the aircraft commander.
   11.1.9. Assist the pilot in obstacle and terrain clearance during flight and ground operations.
   11.1.10. Refuel the aircraft if maintenance personnel are not available.
   11.1.11. Perform any other ground or in-flight duties as briefed by the PIC.
11.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading:
   11.2.1. Normally all air freight, fleet service, and servicing personnel are authorized to
   perform assigned duties in all AFSOC aircraft when escorted by an authorized individual.
   Airfreight personnel are responsible for completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and
   movement of cargo to and from the aircraft. They will advise the crew of destination, size,
   weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.); coordinate traffic activities that may
   affect loading and off-loading; and assign sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo
   handling. Airfreight personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling
   equipment and cargo to or from the aircraft. Air freight personnel, under the direction of the
   crew, load, tie-down, and off-load the cargo. They also assist in stowing the loading
   equipment. If cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during loading or
   off-loading, or loading personnel are injured, the crew will assure the aircraft commander,
   command post, or terminal operations officer is notified.
   11.2.2. As part of the crew and when directed by the PIC, the loadmaster is responsible for
   aircraft preflight, load planning, preparation of weight and balance form, operation of aircraft
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                              73


   equipment, supervision and direction of loading, off-loading, tie-down, and coordination with
   loading crew supervisor for checking the cargo against manifests. The loadmaster supervises
   loading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.
   11.2.3. At locations with no air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities listed in paragraph 11.2.1.
11.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that emergency exits
are available as follows:
   11.3.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
   11.3.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 10 passengers or
   troops. Seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered an obstruction.
   11.3.3. Access to the rear of the aircraft equipped with ramp and doors, entry into cargo or
   baggage areas, or emergency exits must be maintained without exception.
11.4. Air Cargo Restraint Criteria. Cargo will be restrained IAW the AFM/POH, FAA
approved aircraft loading manual or instructions, and this instruction during infil/exfil
operations.
11.5. Preflight Duties. When designated, the loadmaster will normally report to the aircraft
immediately after the crew briefing or as directed by the aircraft commander to begin preflight
and/or loading duties.
11.6. Passenger Handling. Loadmasters will ensure all passengers are manifested. Give one
copy to the PIC for filing and retain sufficient copies for border clearance. The loadmaster will
complete antihijacking requirements for personnel IAW this instruction. Ensure all classified
equipment is not visible prior to passenger boarding. When part of the crew, the loadmaster is
the key figure concerning good passenger relations. Be aware of the concerns that may arise in
the minds of passengers and anticipate their questions and actions.
   11.6.1. Passengers may move about the cargo compartment. Good judgment must be
   exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time. Encourage
   passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated.
   11.6.2. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
   11.6.3. Ensure classified equipment remains covered during the entire mission when
   passengers are on board and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment.
11.7. Troop Movements. Every effort should be made to advise troops of mission progress or
deviations. The troop commander should be identified prior to boarding.
   11.7.1. Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure,
   and advise the aircraft commander of these requirements if appropriate.
   11.7.2. Determine if specific communications requirements exist and coordinate these
   requirements with the PIC.
   11.7.3. Determine if there is a need for the troops to perform any type of in-flight rigging.
   Ensure the aircraft is loaded to accommodate in-flight rigging if required. Inform the PIC
   prior to in-flight rigging. If turbulence is anticipated, the PIC should inform the passengers
   in advance if possible.
 74                                                AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   11.7.4. Ensure troops do not have access to classified equipment during the mission. If
   troops require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the
   PIC prior to the mission.
11.8. Border Clearance. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture require certain forms for
border clearance. If part of the crew, the loadmaster will ensure that required forms are
contained in the aircraft mission kit. Distribute the forms to the crew, ensure their completion
prior to landing, and deliver them to the proper persons.
11.9. Weight and Balance. Weight and balance for the aircraft is accomplished in accordance
with T.O. 1-1B-50 and the AFM/POH, FAA approved aircraft loading instructions or this
instruction.
   11.9.1. A basic handbook of weight and balance, containing current aircraft status, is
   maintained by the unit possessing the aircraft which provides a supplemental weight and
   balance handbook for each aircraft. The loadmaster will carry any additional weight and
   balance documentation necessary for the planned mission.
   11.9.2. Compute weight and balance by using the moments method or the approved
   spreadsheet.
   11.9.3. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for
   providing the appropriate agency with information required to keep documents current and
   accurate.
11.10. Fuel Weight Computation. Use the most accurate method available to compute wing
fuel when calculating total fuel weight.
11.11. Loadmaster Forms: DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, AF Form 463, Cargo
Manifest, DD Form 1854, US Customs Accompanied Baggage Declaration, CF 7507, General
Declaration (Outward/Inward), I-94, Immigration Form, Immigration and Naturalization Service
Arrival/Departure Record (accountable form), AF Form 127, Traffic Transfer Receipt, DD Form
365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F (or the AFM/POH approved form).
11.12. TOLD Cards and Computation. When directed by the aircraft commander, compute
TOLD using the AFM/POH or approved tabulated data.
   11.12.1. Complete TOLD cards for initial takeoff prior to engine start.
WARNING: Do not use tabulated data for initial short field takeoff or landing.
   11.12.2. Following initial takeoff as a minimum, recompute data for pressure altitude
   changes of 500 feet, temperature changes of 5° C, and gross weight changes of 500 lbs.
   11.12.3. On local training missions following initial takeoff and landing, only affected
   speeds need be recomputed if favorable conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all
   other areas (for example, gross weight changes due to fuel burn-off, while pressure altitude
   and temperature remain constant).

                           AIRLAND TACTICAL PROCEDURES

Section 12A—Mission Planning

12.1. General. Missions may be long-range with the low-level portion commencing before
reaching the target area, or short to medium range with the entire mission being flown at low
level. This chapter deals with mission en route procedures prior to reaching the target/objective
area. NSAv crews will not fly low-level missions unless specifically approved by AFSOC/A3.
12.2. Weather Requirements. Weather must be VFR in compliance with AFI 11-202, Volume
3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight Rules, for all tactical operations except for NVG Instrument
Approaches.
12.3. Altimeter Settings. Use the best available altimeter setting. If the current altimeter setting
is not known, set altimeters to the minimum setting briefed for the mission.
12.4. Minimum En route Time. En route flight time from takeoff to time over target will be
sufficient to safely accomplish all required checklists. For airdrops involving personnel, the PIC
and jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes.
12.5. En Route Airspeeds:
   12.5.1. High Altitude. Some missions include a high altitude portion of flight prior to and
   after penetration from target area. Missions must be planned to provide the crew with the
   flexibility necessary to compensate for such in-flight factors as weather deviations, avoidance
   of reported and unreported ground or air threats, and unexpected head or tail winds.
   12.5.2. Low Altitude. Arrival of the aircraft over the specific target at a designated time will
   be within plus or minus two minutes. Gaining or losing significant amounts of time at low
   level has proven to be highly undesirable. The gain or loss of time should be accomplished
   prior to low level so that planned low level entry time is achieved.
12.6. En Route Altitudes:
   12.6.1. High Level. The selected altitude will depend upon factors such as fuel
   consumption, traffic control separation, radar capabilities, threats, terrain factors, and
   meteorological data.
   12.6.2. Low-level. The selected altitude depends upon factors such as threats, moon
   illumination, equipment limitations, weather, and terrain/cultural features. Fly the highest
   altitude commensurate with detection and threat using the following criteria:
       12.6.2.1. Day VMC/Night VMC with NVGs. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet AGL
       modified contour altitude above the terrain by reference to the terrain and radar altimeter,
       if equipped.
       12.6.2.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is a moderately low altitude which will
       provide positive terrain clearance when flight conditions are unacceptable for normal
       operations. To compute the MSA for day modified contour, add the Mean Sea Level
       (MSL) elevation of the highest obstruction or terrain feature within 3 NM of route
       centerline to the AGL flight altitude for that leg. For night visual operations, MSA will
 76                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       be computed by adding 500 feet to the MSL altitude of the highest obstacle or terrain
       feature within 5 NM of route centerline. Round all MSAs to the next higher 100-foot
       increment.
       12.6.2.3. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is an altitude, which will provide
       positive terrain clearance in IMC, during situations that require leaving the low-level
       structure. To compute the ESA, add 1,000 feet to the MSL elevation of the highest
       obstacle/terrain feature within 10 NM of course centerline for that route/route segment.
       For mountainous terrain, use 2,000 feet. Round to the next higher 100-foot increment.
12.7. Mission Planning. One day will normally be allocated for mission planning. Designate
the crew members required to participate. They should be exempted from other duties so their
full attention will be on the mission. Identify individual responsibilities to efficiently use the
time available. Unit training missions and exercises should involve real world scenarios from
planning to debrief. Plan for the current mission requirements and then plan for the "worst case"
situation (i.e., max gross weight, adverse winds, abnormal fuel consumption, enemy
compromise, downed aircraft etc.).
   12.7.1. Mission Feasibility. Prior to conducting comprehensive tactical mission planning, a
   planning staff determines if the mission can be completed. This must be accomplished
   rapidly, as these mission feasibility results will determine the ―go/no-go‖ decision from the
   tasking agency.
   12.7.2. Mission Preparation. In preparation for mission planning, attempt to obtain as much
   as possible of the following:
       12.7.2.1. High quality imagery of target area and landing zone. This facilitates final
       approach planning and LZ recognition.
       12.7.2.2. Landing surface dimensions, obstacles, and surface conditions.
       12.7.2.3. Moisture at the LZ or any other meteorological element that might affect
       landing surface weight bearing capability.
       12.7.2.4. Threats. Use terrain delimited intelligence products to plan threat avoidance
       and compliance with the Air Order of Battle (AOB), Ground Order of Battle (GOB), or
       other mission related information.
       12.7.2.5. Assemble as many different charts and photographs of the area of operations as
       possible. As a minimum the following three charts are required, when available.
           12.7.2.5.1. VFR Sectional or Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) 1:500,000. The VFR
           sectional is consulted because it is updated more frequently than the Joint Operations
           Graphic (JOG). It also provides accurate information on controlled airspace, major
           towers, airports, beacons, and power lines as well as current magnetic variation. The
           sectional should normally not be used for 500 foot contour flying as its scale does not
           allow sufficient detail for accurate pilotage, and is relatively cluttered, unless JOGs
           are not available.
           12.7.2.5.2. Joint Operations Graph (JOG) 1:250,000. The JOG or equivalent is the
           primary chart for planning and flying the en route portion of the mission. The scale
           provides for a relatively small chart, uncluttered with extraneous information. It has
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                                 77


           latitude/longitude and UTM coordinates, and when properly prepared, is very "night"
           compatible.
           12.7.2.5.3. Tactical 1:50,000 or larger. The tactical chart (1:50,000) is used to
           accurately locate and confirm unique map features and to transfer them to the JOG. It
           displays more detail in those areas, which may be difficult to interpret on the JOG. It
           should be used for the run in from Initial Points (IPs) to LZ/DZ. Consider using
           geological survey charts if 1:50,000 charts are not available. Relief charts are also
           very helpful, when available.
NOTE: Use caution when transitioning to 1:50,000 charts from the JOG. The aircraft is
traveling at a relatively faster rate over this chart and pilotage pacing will increase.
       12.7.2.6. Because charts rapidly become outdated, aerial photos (especially low altitude
       oblique shots) should be requested for the entire route. As a minimum, a strip 5 NM
       either side of centerline from the IPs to the LZ should be obtained.
       12.7.2.7. Use demographics and cultural features to facilitate identifying tactics and
       operating window.
NOTE: If these requirements are not satisfied, additional maneuvering and reconnaissance may
be required in the target area.
12.8. Chart Preparation. Draw the route of flight on a topographic chart of 1:250,000 scale or
larger. Center symbols depicting checkpoints, IPs, objectives, and so forth on the point. Course
lines will not be drawn through these symbols. It is absolutely imperative that the navigation
chart be prepared accurately with extreme care and attention to detail. Use one chart per
mission. The entire route of flight from departure point to recovery point should be included on
a chart. Since chart scale and route length may create large charts unsuitable for the flight deck
it may be necessary to strip charts into workable sizes. When stripped charts are used, a larger
scale chart such as a sectional should be prepared with the route and turn points to allow for
major unplanned deviations during critical mission phases and emergency egress. Do not use the
same chart for a different mission in the same area. Avoid cluttering the chart. Outline only
those features that you expect to see (significant terrain contours, railroads, power lines, towers,
etc.). Annotate the chart with the following items:
   12.8.1. Circled and labeled turn points/check points connected by course lines. Course lines
   may be plotted either point-to-point or radius of turn.
   12.8.2. A circle with a diagonal line will depict emergency airfields.
   12.8.3. A line across the course line will depict the combat entry point (CEP).
   12.8.4. Annotate time marks, or distance marks, or both on the low-level course line.
   12.8.5. Magnetic course, leg distance, leg time, and MSA will be annotated in a course
   arrow box along each leg of the route. Optional course arrow boxes can be used as long as
   they contain, as a minimum, the above listed information.
   12.8.6. ESA for the route/route segment and MSA for each leg/leg segment, as applicable.
   ESA will be conspicuously annotated on the chart. Draw a box around the obstruction that
   each MSA is based upon.
 78                                                 AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   12.8.7. When the Chart Update Manual (CHUM) information is available, low-level charts
   will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information as contained in the most
   recent CHUM or supplement. Charts will be chummed at least 10 NM either side of the
   planned route of flight. On the chart, individuals will annotate current CHUM, chart edition,
   date chart completed and ground speed chart was drawn for.
   12.8.8. Special use airspace, military training routes, and other airspace boundaries that may
   affect the mission within 3 NM of course centerline.
   12.8.9. Visual navigational checkpoints between turn points.
   12.8.10. Threat locations and order of battle (OB) information as applicable to the mission.
   If this information is classified, the chart will be properly marked.
   12.8.11. Location of in-flight warnings.
   12.8.12. For multiengine aircraft, compute a single engine service ceiling to determine if
   single engine capability exists along the route of flight.
12.9. Low-level Log. Use a low-level log to plan all low-level missions.
   12.9.1. The PF will use an in-flight low-level log during all low-level missions. The log
   may be computer generated or manually prepared. As a minimum, the log will contain the
   following information: ESA for the route or route segment, name of each turn point and
   coordinates, and for each leg, magnetic course, distance, time, and MSA.
   12.9.2. The navigating pilot is encouraged to use a low-level log in flight, however it is not a
   substitute for an individually prepared route chart.
12.10. Route and Turn Point Selection. The route to and from the target area must be
tactically sound but not so difficult as to inhibit successful navigation. Each mission will differ
and involve numerous variables. Listed below are general rules for proper route selection.
   12.10.1. Route Selection.
       12.10.1.1. Avoid brightly-lit areas, roads, and population centers.
       12.10.1.2. Avoid planning the route near navigational aids or airports. Hazards include
       other aviation operations and detection by radar oriented on these facilities.
       12.10.1.3. Plan to negotiate large north-south valleys on the upwind side, and if able,
       also on the moonlit side. This helps avoid turbulence and shadows cast by the moon, and
       permits silhouetting of terrain features for navigation.
       12.10.1.4. Plan to negotiate narrow valleys and passes in an east-west or west-east
       direction (depending on where the moon is) so the terrain will be visible and shadows
       avoided.
       12.10.1.5. To the maximum extent possible, avoid planning a route that heads directly
       into a low angle rising or setting moon. Alter the course, as necessary, to fly a zigzag
       course when left with no alternatives.
       12.10.1.6. To the maximum extent possible, select intermediate reference points (e.g.,
       power lines, towers, roads, rivers, ponds, railroads, etc.) along each leg of the route for
       course confirmation and timing. Computing hard times for each of these points is time
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                              79


     consuming but valuable. This provides rapid feedback on time status, which enables the
     crew to more easily recover in case of a late departure or mission time of arrival (TOA)
     changes.
     12.10.1.7. If possible, plan to cross major roads, railroads, and rivers at large angles (90
     degrees) in order to reduce exposure time. Avoid flying an en route segment, which
     follows lines of communication.
     12.10.1.8. If it is impossible to avoid flight near population centers or major roads, and
     the area is hostile or compromising, consider flying that leg at a higher airspeed in order
     to reduce exposure time.
     12.10.1.9. Anticipate power lines/wires being located near roads, towers, and buildings
     in open fields. Warn the pilot of upcoming power lines, towers, and other obstructions.
     12.10.1.10. Plan alternate routes and cut-offs in the event the primary route is unusable
     due to weather, enemy compromise, mission TOA changes, late departures, etc. It is
     especially important to plan alternate run-ins in case of runway change or enemy
     compromise at the original IPs. Mission planning and adherence to the planned route of
     flight is critical to the success of low-level operations. Flying off centerline may be
     necessary for more effective terrain masking or to avoid populated areas or known
     threats. These adjustments should be made during mission planning, if possible.
     Aircrews may deviate from planned route in-flight due to unforeseen factors. Keep
     deviations to the minimum required. Maintain position awareness at all times.
  12.10.2. Turn Point Selection. After a general route has been determined, select turn points
  to control movement and time along the route. Study the turn points carefully using all
  available charts and photos. Listed below are general rules for turn point selection.
     12.10.2.1. Turn points should be unique natural or man-made features which are
     detectable at a distance. Avoid features that are only visible when directly overhead (e.g.,
     a small bridge in heavy vegetation or a small road crossing in the forest).
     12.10.2.2. Turn points should contrast with the surrounding terrain. Small paved roads
     are poor features to use in terrain with heavy vegetation, but provide excellent contrast in
     a desert environment. Small bodies of water provide very little contrast in terrain with
     vegetation, but contrast well in the desert.
     12.10.2.3. Avoid selecting turn points near towns as the town will invariably grow and
     may make detection of the turn point difficult. Additionally, overflying towns may
     compromise the security of the mission.
     12.10.2.4. Turn points should not be in the vicinity of bright lights.
     12.10.2.5. Turn points should be confirmed by using a prominent feature along the route
     and close to the turn point.
     12.10.2.6. Consider the moon angle and illumination. The turn point should not fall
     within the shadow cast by nearby terrain features. A moon in front of the aircraft will
     make turn point identification difficult.
 80                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       12.10.2.7. Try to select prominent barriers near turn points. It is often better to discard a
       good turn point with no barrier in favor of a more difficult turn point with an excellent
       barrier.
       12.10.2.8. The first and last turn points of the route are the most important. An easily
       identifiable feature should be used even if the flight route must be altered slightly. This
       helps ensure positive location and timing. When planning an IP, allow enough time to
       get the aircraft configured and stable for the approach, but not so much time that
       drift/enemy compromise become limiting factors.
       12.10.2.9. If possible, LZs should have an IP that aligns the run-in with the runway axis.
       However, a good IP is more important than an exact alignment with the runway heading.
       If the threat environment allows, consider conducting a "270" maneuver. This maneuver
       allows for IPs 90 degrees off runway axis, and for an "unaided" LZ, easier identification
       of the landing area. Allow ample time to complete the maneuver in planning.
       12.10.2.10. In varying terrain, make note of the MSL altitude at each turn point to aid in
       turn point identification. This technique is especially valuable in mountainous terrain.
12.11. Crew Briefing. It is imperative that a complete and detailed crew briefing is conducted
prior to low-level flight. This briefing is normally conducted by the navigating pilot, and covers
as a minimum the following items:
   12.11.1. ESA and the determining obstacle.
   12.11.2. Alternate airfields.
   12.11.3. Combat entry point.
   12.11.4. The location of in-flight warnings.
   12.11.5. For each leg, the course, distance, time, MSA and significant terrain or threats.
   12.11.6. The objective area. Review the survey and any aerial photography or tactical charts
   (1:50,000) available and brief the following items:
       12.11.6.1. For an LZ, brief the runway orientation, the run-in orientation, the LZ
       dimensions, significant obstacles, expected markings, planned point of touchdown and its
       coordinates, go-around point, escape route in the event of a balked landing, and compare
       LZ length to performance data for landing and for takeoff.
       12.11.6.2. For a DZ, brief the DZ orientation, its dimensions, significant obstacles,
       expected markings, point of impact and its coordinates, escape route, type of drop,
       altitude, green light time, computed air release point (CARP) or high altitude release
       point (HARP), and emergency procedures.
   12.11.7. Action to follow (i.e., combat exit point, subsequent low-level route).
   12.11.8. Pilots will brief emergency actions for loss of NVGs during critical phases of flight
   (takeoffs, landings, airdrops, etc.). Specific procedures are at the PIC‘s discretion.
12.12. In-flight Aircrew Procedures.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                              81


  12.12.1. For aircraft equipped with a radar altimeter, set the altitude clearance markers to 90
  percent of the desired route altitude. Activation of the low altitude warning system indicates
  the aircraft is too low and an immediate correction is necessary.
  12.12.2. For aircraft not equipped with an operable radar altimeter, pilots must ensure that
  desired terrain clearance is maintained visually and altitude is based off the altimeter.
  12.12.3. Updating the aircraft‘s navigation system. Aircraft navigation systems updates help
  maintain course and assist the visual acquisition of route checkpoints. Updates may be made
  at intermediate visual checkpoints as well as turn points.
  12.12.4. Turns are normally made at the turn point; however, terrain masking may require
  turning at an offset turn point. When the turn point cannot be located visually, the turn will
  be initiated when:
  12.12.5. At the preplanned linear boundary, the leg time elapsed, or the aircraft navigation
  system distance-to-go stops decreasing.
  12.12.6. GPS/FMS Procedures. When operating aircraft with GPS/FMS systems installed,
  aircrews may use the GPS/FMS for situational awareness and as a backup to visual
  navigation. Aircrews operating aircraft without GPS/FMS installed may use portable GPS
  units (PGUs) in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFSOC Sup 1, General Flight
  Rules. PGUs should be connected to aircraft power and properly grounded. Ensure system
  use and operation does not interfere with navigation or aircraft control.
  12.12.7. Emergency Procedures.
     12.12.7.1. Disorientation. When a crew becomes disoriented, immediately establish
     your position by identifying a prominent terrain feature or landmark.
         12.12.7.1.1. Climb to the ESA during IMC or MSA if in VMC. Maintain this
         altitude until positively fixing your position. While higher altitudes will increase the
         field of view and reduce the terrain hazard, it also exposes the aircraft to threats.
         12.12.7.1.2. After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations.
         Cross-check the timing and make any necessary adjustments.
         12.12.7.1.3. Terrain, threat, weather, controlled airspace, and mission are factors to
         consider when executing an emergency climb. The aircraft commander must
         consider each of these factors prior to his decision to make an emergency climb.
     12.12.7.2. Engine Out for multiengine aircraft:
         12.12.7.2.1. Discontinue low-level if feasible.
         12.12.7.2.2. If low-level flying is necessary, fly the appropriate minimum safe
         altitude.
  12.12.8. Overwater Low-level Procedures. When descending into an overwater low-level
  environment, the water may not be visible until approximately 100 feet above water level
  (AWL). To decrease the chance of impacting the water, match the descending vertical speed
  (i.e., vertical speed or velocity indicator – VSI or VVI) to the height above the water. The
  loadmaster or PNF will backup the PF by monitoring VVI and altimeters.
 82                                                  AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


   12.12.9. En Route Airspeed. During night low-level operations, the crew must remain alert
   and be prepared to react properly in the event of an emergency, particularly engine failure.
   To help provide a margin of safety, fly the low-level route in accordance with the following
   procedures (not applicable to contingencies):
       12.12.9.1. Minimum airspeed is best rate of climb airspeed (e.g., VY , VYSE, or VFTO)
       with flaps up, and best angle of climb speed (VX ,VXSE, or V2) with flaps set at approach
       or take-off settings
       12.12.9.2. When minimum airspeeds results in excessive groundspeed, use offset
       maneuvering or orbits around the turn point to control en route time.
12.13. Aircrew Duties. Specific duties are:
   12.13.1. Pilot Flying. Primarily responsible for terrain clearance, heading, and airspeed.
   Obstruction avoidance area of responsibility is immediately ahead and to their side of the
   aircraft.
   12.13.2. Pilot Not Flying. Primarily responsible for navigation and time control.
   Obstruction avoidance area of responsibility is immediately ahead and to their side of the
   aircraft. Provide the pre-turn point information to include new magnetic course, distance,
   MSA, description of turn point, and significant terrain description. The PF will acknowledge
   the new magnetic course and MSA. The turn point briefing and course acknowledgment
   must be completed prior to the turn point so as not to distract the crew from positively
   identifying the turn point. Both pilots should reset their heading markers to the new course
   when able. Monitor the pilot‘s airspeed, heading and bank angle as a back up. Primarily
   responsible for all radio traffic after the CEP.
NOTE: During low-level operations, the pilots must be in their seats at all times. If either pilot
must leave the seat, climb to the appropriate MSA prior to leaving the seat. If equipped, the
jump seat will be occupied by a mission qualified crew member or a basic qualified crew
member receiving mission upgrade training.
   12.13.3. Loadmaster. Primarily responsible for aircraft systems management and cockpit
   equipment operation, unless briefed otherwise. Provides back up for the pilots on airspeeds,
   altitudes, headings, and terrain avoidance. Since the pilots are focusing their outside
   attention close to the aircraft, the loadmaster clears farther ahead for obstructions and other
   aircraft.
12.14. Navigating to Landing Zones/Drop Zones. Some missions may require operations into
unmarked and uncontrolled LZ/DZs. Mission effectiveness depends upon detailed intelligence,
extensive aircrew planning and study, precision en route navigation and time control, accurate
and timely LZ/DZ recognition, and positive aircrew coordination.
   12.14.1. Markings. LZ/DZs are marked IAW the guidance provided in this instruction and
   AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.
   12.14.2. Training. Aircrews will normally use AMP-3 with covert lighting or AMP-4
   markings for training. To sustain proficiency in the most demanding situations, light
   configuration priority for the first approach is to an AMP-4 configuration.
   12.14.3. Fuel Planning. The chance of a successful navigation to an unmarked LZ/DZ
   decreases when equivalent moon illumination is less than 10% or there is little or no contrast
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012                                                               83


   between the LZ/DZ and surrounding area. Plan 20 minutes additional fuel at maximum
   continuous power settings for operations involving unmarked LZ/DZs.
12.15. Landing Zone Surveys.
   12.15.1. All LZs must be surveyed in accordance with AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop
   Zone and Landing Zone Procedures.
   12.15.2. HQ AFSOC/A3, or designated representative, is the approval authority for all
   unpublished surveys. HQ AFSOC/A3 or designated representative, is also the waiver
   authority for LZ criteria and survey requirements.
12.16. Terminal Area Landing Procedures:
   12.16.1. Initial Approach. When pre-mission intelligence requirements are not satisfied for
   LZs, additional maneuvering and reconnaissance may be required in the target area. Perform
   reconnaissance maneuvering with approach flaps.
NOTE: During operational training, aircraft must be stabilized, aligned with the runway from
100 feet AGL on final to touchdown or a go-around must be accomplished.

NOTE: If the PF determines that the actual touchdown point is going to be different than what
was briefed, the PF must verbalize the updated touchdown point.
   12.16.2. Communications. If landing clearance or go-around signals are to be given via
   radio, two-way communications with the reception committee must be established prior to
   landing. If communication out procedures are used, presence of a pre-briefed signal
   constitutes clearance to land. A signal must be pre-briefed to direct a go-around. Radio
   clearance to land is the primary method when more than one aircraft is using the LZ.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

14.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, squadron, or local flight safety
officer.
14.2. AFSOC IMT 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet. Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and the AFSOC Sup. The Safety Office (HQ AFSOC/SE) will be
notified of the following high interest items: Off drop zone (DZ) drops, insertion injuries, IFR
incidents, dropped objects, or any other incident which, in the judgment of the Flight Safety
Officer (FSO), needs to be reported. Use the AFSOC IMT 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet,
when reporting these incidents to HQ AFSOC/SE. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
Reports, and the AFSOC Sup provide policy guidance that is common to investigating and
reporting all US Air Force mishaps and instructions for using AFSOC IMT 97, Aircraft Incident
Worksheet. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future
mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal investigations, except
friendly fire mishaps.
14.3. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force
personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt
corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may
jeopardize the health and well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or
destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
14.4. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). Refer to AFI 91-202, The US
Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, Attachment 3.
   14.4.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
   midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATR
   reports only for mishap prevention. AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
   Program, list reportable incidents.
   14.4.2. Procedures:
       14.4.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
       (e.g., center, FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and give the following
       information as appropriate:
           14.4.2.1.1. Identification or call sign.
           14.4.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.).
           14.4.2.1.3. Altitude or flight level.
           14.4.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
           14.4.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a
           written HATR report will be filed upon landing.
NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA, etc.) must know if an official report is being filed.
 86                                                    AFSOCI11-2NSAvV3 18 JANUARY 2012


       14.4.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means
       of communication. Normally, it should be filed at the base operations office at the
       landing airport. If this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety
       office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home
       station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM. In any case, provide the safety office
       with all available information needed to prepare AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic
       Report (HATR). Turn in a completed copy of AF IMT 651 to the wing/group safety
       office.
NOTE: HATR reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
   14.4.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action
   provided:
       14.4.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
       14.4.3.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       14.4.3.3. No mishap occurred.
       14.4.3.4. They properly reported the incident using the above procedures.
14.5. AF IMT 711, USAF Aircraft Mishap Report Worksheet. Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports.
   14.5.1. Responsibilities. Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft
   or crew. When notified, AFSOC units will initiate investigative and reporting actions in
   accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
NOTE: Do not attempt to classify a mishap.

                          EQUAL TIME POINT CALCULATIONS

A2.1. Equal Time Point (ETP). The equal time point is an airborne decision point. It is the
point along the route of flight (usually over water) from which it takes the same amount of time
to return to the point of departure (or to the last suitable airfield) as it would to continue to the
destination (or the first suitable airfield). In no wind conditions, the ETP is simply the halfway
point between the two airfields. However, when flying into a headwind, the ETP moves closer
to the destination aerodrome. Conversely, when flying into a tailwind, the ETP moves closer to
the departure aerodrome. These calculations will also be impacted by the decision to fly at lower
altitudes due to loss of aircraft pressurization without supplemental oxygen. The distance and
time to the ETP from the departure aerodrome (or last suitable airfield) may be calculated using
the following formulas:
                                                    (Total Distance) x (Ground Speed Home)
                          Distance to ETP =
                                                  (Ground Speed Out) + (Ground Speed Home)

                                                                 Distance to ETP
                              Time to ETP =
                                                                Ground Speed Out

              Problem:                                           Solution:

Distance from A to B: 800 NM
                                                             800 x 300        240,000
Wind: 50 kts headwind                  Distance to ETP                   =            = 480 NM
                                                             200 + 300          500
TAS: 250 kts

GS Out: 200 kts (250 kts - 50 kt

headwind)                               Time to ETP      =                             =    2.4 hrs
                                                                    200 kts
