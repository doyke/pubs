                                             Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Religious Professional Scholarship Program
     1.1.1. RPSP was initiated in 2009 as an incentive program for interested personnel to fill
     high-demand, low-density religious faith group needs within the AF Chaplain Corps. The
     program offered RegAF officers and enlisted members, civilians and graduating Air Force
     Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) and United States Air Force Academy (USAFA)
     cadets the opportunity to be accessed into the Air Force Reserve in order to participate in the
     Air Force Chaplain Candidate Program.
     1.1.2. AF pays tuition and applicable fees/educational expenses for those currently in RPSP
     as they pursue their studies and continue to meet all program requirements. Participants also
     receive a monthly stipend for living expenses except while on active duty. Participants incur
     an Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) as a result of their participation in the RPSP,
     IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitment.
     1.1.3. RPSP will continue until all current participants successfully complete the program,
     voluntarily withdraw from the program or are removed from the program.
1.2. Religious Professional Deferment Program
     1.2.1. RPDP succeeds RPSP as the new incentive program for those interested in filling
     critical high-demand, low-density religious faith group needs of the AF. RPDP became
     available in May 2013 and is open to all prospective Total Force applicants, AFROTC or
     USAFA cadets. RPDP allows approved, qualified candidates to be appointed as Ready
     Reservists, upon approval for original reserve appointment from the Secretary of Defense
     (SecDef), and become participants in the AF Chaplain Candidate Program. Once program
     and ecclesiastical requirements are met and upon AF/HC approval, candidates must be
     resubmitted for SecDef approval to reappoint as chaplains in the AF Reserve.
     1.2.2. RPDP defers any prior outstanding ADSC until the candidates successfully completes
     the program, voluntarily withdraws from the program, or is removed from the program. At
     that point each candidate must complete any outstanding ADSC. RPDP does not provide
     financial compensation for the enrollees.
