1. General. This instruction implements the AFISRA Flight Plan process. The AFISRA Flight
Plan is the AF construct for developing and advocating an enterprise-focused, cradle-to-grave,
capabilities-based development and sustainment plan for AF ISR capabilities for the AF to
present to the joint and national intelligence community (IC) and joint force and combatant

commanders. The ISR enterprise includes all elements involved in the Planning & Direction,
Collection, Processing & Exploitation, Analysis & Production, and Dissemination (PCPAD) of
ISR activities defined in Joint Publication 2-01, Joint and National Intelligence Support to
Military Operations. The intent of the Flight Plan process is to identify and resolve capability
gaps in ISR processes, reduce duplication, support interoperability, increase efficiency and
effectiveness, and advocate for integrated solutions throughout the ISR enterprise. This
instruction is applicable to all AFISRA units.
2. Organizational Responsibilities.
     2.1. Headquarters Air Force (HAF)/A2. HAF/A2, as the overall lead for the AF ISR Flight
     Plan, published the AF ISR Flight Plan Directive to outline the structure required to
     administer the Flight Plan. Flight Plan administration uses a strategy-to-task, capabilities-
     based process that includes a three-tiered structure to plan ISR capabilities for the future—
     the Flight Plan Needs/Solutions Panels (FPNP/FPSP), Flight Plan Board (FPB), and Flight
     Plan Council (FPC). The FPNP working groups use a strategy-to-task methodology to
     develop the AF Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) which are used to guide the evaluation of AF
     ISR tasks to identify capability gaps. The capability gaps are prioritized and forwarded to the
     FPNP for adjudication and subsequent forwarding to the FPB and FPC for final review,
     coordination and approval. The FPSP, FPB, and FPC provide the forums necessary to
     develop the ISR portfolio for acquisition purposes. These forums address how to acquire
     ISR capabilities to counter threats across all domains, particularly air, space, and cyberspace
     2.2. Major Commands (MAJCOMS): IAW the AF ISR Flight Plan Directive, MAJCOMs
     will participate in the administration of the Flight Plan by participating in the FPNP, FPC,
     and FPB. Additionally, per CSAF direction, Air Combat Command (ACC) will lead
     execution of the ISR Flight Plan.
     2.3. AFISRA. AF Mission Directive (AFMD) 15 states AFISRA organizes, trains, equips,
     and presents assigned forces and capabilities to conduct ISR for combatant commanders and
     the nation. The AFISRA implements and oversees execution of HAF/A2 policy and
     guidance to expand AF ISR capabilities to meet current and future challenges. As such,
     AFISRA plays a major role in the Flight Plan process. AFISRA/A5R co-chairs the FPNP
     and A3 participates in the FPSP. Additionally, as participants in the AF ISR PCPAD
     processes, AFISRA and subordinate units submit capability gaps into the Flight Plan process.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     3.1. AFISRA/A5R will:
        3.1.1. Function as the primary focal point for administering the AF ISR Flight Plan
        process for AFISRA.
        3.1.2. Act as an “honest broker” for all MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs),
        and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) participating in the Flight Plan process.
        3.1.3. Co-chair the FPNP with HAF/A5XC.
        3.1.4. Develop processes to enable the development and approval of AF Battlespace
        Awareness (BA) JCAs and subsequent capability gaps (see Glossary-Terms, Attachment
        1).
AFISRAI14-130 30 AUGUST 2010                                                                   3


     3.1.5. Develop and manage a process for submitting a prioritized list of ISR capability
     gaps to the FPNP.
     3.1.6. Develop and manage a process to address and resolve ISR capability gaps that
     lend themselves to non-materiel solutions.
     3.1.7. Provide direction to AFISRA organizations to implement the AF ISR Flight Plan
     process.
     3.1.8. Chairs the Non-Materiel Solutions Working Group (NMSWG) and supports
     similar FP-sponsored efforts focused on developing possible non-material solutions to
     ISR capability gaps.
     3.1.9. Prepare and publish agendas for and announce meetings of the FPNP and
     NMSWG.
     3.1.10. Prepare and publish meeting minutes and results for the NMSWG.
     3.1.11. Notify ISR-related research and development efforts (e.g., Geo-INT Capabilities
     Working Group [GCWG]) of ISR capability gaps on an annual basis.
  3.2. AFISRA/A3 will:
     3.2.1. Upon notification by AFISRA/A5R, request HQ AFISRA directorates and
     subordinate units to submit ISR-related gaps via the ISR-Capabilities Analysis and
     Requirements Tool (CART) on SIPRNET at http://isr-cart.afisr.af.smil.mil/templates/.
     3.2.2. Review all capability gaps submitted by AFISRA organizations to ensure proper
     format and avoid duplication.
     3.2.3. Validate all capability gaps originated by AFISRA units and submit them via ISR-
     CART to AFISRA/A5R (IAW AFISRA Instruction 14-225, Management of the
     Distributed Common Ground System [DCGS] Program, capability gaps concerning the
     AF DCGS will be coordinated with AFISRA/A5W prior to submission to A5R).
     3.2.4. Participate as a voting member in the FPSP chaired by HAF/A2D.
     3.2.5. Assist Air Force Materiel Command with identifying materiel solutions and A5R
     with identifying non-materiel solutions for ISR capability gaps.
  3.3. AFISRA/A1/A2/A3/A4-7/A5-8-9/A6 and all HQ AFISRA subordinate units will:
     3.3.1. Develop procedures for subordinate units (if applicable) to evaluate their ability to
     accomplish assigned ISR tasks using the AF ISR JCAs as a guide.
     3.3.2. Identify capability gaps by evaluating their ability to accomplish applicable ISR
     tasks using the AF JCAs as a guide (evaluate only those tasks that are applicable to your
     mission).
     3.3.3. Submit capability gaps to the next higher echelon (i.e., squadrons submit to
     groups; groups submit to wings, etc.) via ISR-CART. Centers, groups and wings will
     validate subordinate units’ capability gaps, resolve duplicate submissions, and forward
     them appropriately. HQ AFISRA directorates and subordinate units, Centers, and wings
     will submit gaps directly to A3O.

Terms
Capability—The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions
through combinations of means and ways across the doctrine, organization, training, materiel,
leadership and educations, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) to perform a set of tasks to
execute a specified course of action. (CJCSI 3170.01G, 1 Mar 2009)
Capability gap—The inability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and
conditions through combinations of means and ways to perform a set of tasks. The gap may be a
result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency in existing capability, or the need to replace
an existing capability. (CJCSI 3170.01G, 1 Mar 2009)
Joint Capability Area—Collections of like DOD capabilities functionally grouped to support
capability analysis, strategy development, investment decision making, capability portfolio
management, and capabilities-based force development and operational planning. (CJCSI
3170.01G, 1 Mar 2009)
Flight Plan Board—The ISR Flight Plan Board (FPB) is the middle tier of the 3-tier Flight Plan
structure. It provides the next level of review, coordination and approval of the ISR Flight Plan
process above the FPNP/FPSP. Composed of MAJCOM Intelligence Deputies, it will meet
formally at least semi-annually to support the FPC and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting
and Execution process.
Flight Plan Council—Led by AF/A2, this council guides AF ISR capability management and
incremental improvement to ensure AF ISR has the capabilities required to execute the joint
fight. Based on National, DOD and AF Strategy, it will prioritize AF ISR needs based on
combatant command and MAJCOM ISR requirements and solutions analysis. Composed of
MAJCOM A2-level representatives, the FPC will meet at least annually.
Flight Plan Needs Panel—The ISR Flight Plan Needs Panel (FPNP) will identify, analyze,
refine, document, and prioritize ISR shortfalls and gaps. The FPNP will conduct an ISR area and
needs analysis and act as OPR for ISR capability shortfalls and gaps internal and external to the
AF. The FPNP is composed of A2X-level representatives and will meet as required to support
FPB semi-annual meetings and FPSP meetings.
AFISRAI14-130 30 AUGUST 2010                                                                   7


Flight Plan Solutions Panel—The ISR Flight Plan Solutions Panel (FPSP) will conduct ISR
portfolio solutions management related to the needs and shortfalls identified by the FPNP and
approved by the FPB in support of the Air Force ISR Capablities-based Planning Process. The
solutions management will identify what activities in the Capability Planning Process, the
Requirements Generation Process, or the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
process need to be taken in order to address the ISR needs and shortfalls. The FPSP will meet at
least quarterly and will consist of expert senior intelligence program representatives at the A2X
level.
