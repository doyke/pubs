     PAS code change, update, or deletion requested by Headquarters, Air Force Reserve Command or
     Headquarters, Air National Guard. DFAS-DE/FJR, will, in turn, provide the information to
     DFAS-DE/FJFBB1 (Computer Tables) for updating Table 26.

1.5. Supporting Documents.
     1.5.1. Original Documents. See, also, 1.5.2., “Datafax Documents.” DJMS-RC requires source docu-
     ments or system certified data from collateral systems (e.g., PDS, RCIS) for all transactions to support
     changes to a master military pay account (MMPA). Acceptable documentation includes the following:
        1.5.1.1. Signed and certified documents which justify each transaction (see Chapter 4, “Support-
        ing Document Files (SDF)”) including those transactions which do not directly affect pay and
        allowances (e.g., TD Form W-4, Employees Withholding Allowance Certification, and SF 1199A,
        Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form).
        1.5.1.2. Signature must be original, or a carbon copy, or the document may be a certified true
        copy. The RC payroll office is responsible for ensuring the supporting documents are complete
        and signed. Corrections to documents must be made in ink, lined through once, and initialed by
        the individual who certified the applicable information. Correction tape and/or white out cannot be
        used.
        1.5.1.3. Messages sent via standard Department of Defense (DoD) communications or internal
        Air Force and ANG electronic mail system will be accepted as supporting documents providing
        the annotation “Source Documents on File” is annotated on the request.
        1.5.1.4. For AFRES Only: All supporting documents received in a RC payroll office must be
        date-stamped when received. If the document must be returned to the reservist, or sent to another
        office for more information, ensure it is redated (stamped) upon its return to the payroll office.
            1.5.1.4.1. Ninety-five percent of all documents received by the AFRES payroll office(s)
            should be processed within two (2) workdays after receipt.
     1.5.2. Datafax Documents. See, also, 1.5.1., “Original Documents.” The GAO manual for Guidance
     of Federal Agencies, Title 7, Section 6.28, and 31 U.S.C. 1501, requires transactions to be supported
     by documentary evidence. However, there is no prohibition against the use of documentation that is
     datafaxed.
        1.5.2.1. Effective with message 161421Z NOV 93, subject: Facsimile (FAX) Transmission and
        Receipt of JUMPS Source Documents, the following guidance is provided:
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                         29


          1.5.2.1.1. RC payroll offices may accept, from members, FAX transmission of source docu-
          ments necessary to support:


              Address changes
              Financial Organization Account changes
              Allotment starts, stops, and changes
              Leave requests
              TD Forms W-4 to change withholding


          1.5.2.1.2. RC payroll office may accept via FAX, with review and signature of either the
          member’s commander or the comptroller/budget officer at the member’s duty location, any
          pay-affecting source document to include but not limited to:


              AF Form 220
              AF Form 594
              DD Form 938


          1.5.2.1.3. These datafaxed documents are to be treated as the original source document and
          submitted to DFAS-DE accordingly. The originals of these documents should be retained by
          the originator, not the RC payroll office.

1.6. Scope.
   1.6.1. Payment. DJMS-RC provides computerized payment of pay and allowances to members of Air
   Reserve Forces for:
      1.6.1.1. Inactive duty training (IDT)
      1.6.1.2. Additional flying training periods (AFTP)
      1.6.1.3. Initial tours of active duty (IADT) for non-prior service members performing basic mili-
      tary training (BMT), technical training, and on-the-job training (OJT).
      1.6.1.4. Active duty tours except:
          1.6.1.4.1. Active duty performed by officers and airmen as identified in Chapter 24, “Pay-
          ments by DJMS-AC” and Chapter 28, “Mobilization”. These members are paid by the Joint
          Uniform Military Pay System – Joint Service Software – Active Component (JUMPS/
          JSS-AC).
          1.6.1.4.2. Travel allowances for periods of active duty (see DFAS-DER 7010-3). (Air Force
          Reserve Payroll Office.)
      1.6.1.5. Uniform allowance for officers.
30                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


        1.6.1.6. Disability payments for members who become incapacitated while performing inactive
        duty or active duty. See 43.4.3., “Incapacitation Pay.”
        1.6.1.7. Subsistence, stipend, books, fees, commutation, and training payments (as applicable) for
        HPIP and ROTC members. See Chapter 34 for details.
     1.6.2. Accounting for Appropriations. DFAS-DE maintains accounting records and provides account-
     ing and financial management reports for the ANG appropriation (3850), AFRES appropriation
     (3700), and the military personnel appropriation (MPA) (3500) except for:
        1.6.2.1. Temporary duty (TDY) and permanent change of station (PCS) travel funds.
        1.6.2.2. Subsistence, books, commutation, and training payments (as applicable) for ROTC mem-
        bers.
     1.6.3. Accounting for Taxes. DFAS-DE maintains records on, prepares reports, and pays Federal
     Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes, federal income tax withheld (FITW), and state income tax
     withheld (SITW). See Chapter 30, “Federal/State Income Tax, Federal Insurance Contributions.”

1.7. Interface. DJMS-RC is interfaced with:
     1.7.1. Personnel Data System (PDS). The Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) inputs per-
     sonnel data to DJMS-RC by Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN).
     1.7.2. Point Credit Accounting and Reporting System (PCARS). DFAS-DE collects performance data
     by computer and transmits to AFMPC by AUTODIN (see AFMAN 36-2622 V1).
     1.7.3. Lackland Trainee Initial Pay System (TIPS). The FMO at Lackland Air Force Base (AFB) pays
     non-prior service enlistees initial payments in the same amount and under the same procedures as
     those set up for extended active duty members attending basic military training. The Lackland AFB
     FMO processes payments in DJMS-RC as paid-for-others transactions via the Trainee Initial Pay Sys-
     tem (TIPS). See Chapter 10, ANG and USAFR Non-Prior Service Members.”
     1.7.4. Retiree Annuitant Pay System (RAPS). DJMS-RC formats records of payments to members
     identified as receiving Air Force retired pay and passes the records to RAPS. RAPS processes the
     records against the retiree’s pay account and deducts 1 day’s retired pay for each calendar day of pay
     the member receives from DJMS-RC. See Chapter 35, “Waiver of Compensation or Benefits.”
     1.7.5. Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. DJMS-RC formats records of
     federal income tax withheld (FITW), taxable income, Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA)
     deductions, and FICA wages, and creates tapes of the data. See Chapter 30, “Federal/State Income
     Tax, Federal Insurance Contributions.”
     1.7.6. Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). DJMS-RC system reports members’ pay data to
     DMDC on magnetic tapes. DMDC then loads the pay data on their system. Other agencies, e.g., Vet-
     erans Administration (VA), may then obtain information from DMDC to reconcile the VA pay offset
     of those who received dual compensations (e.g., Reserve pay, as well as VA disability payment). VA
     determines the overpayment amount as well as performs the collection function.

1.8. Responsibilities For Input.
     1.8.1. RC Payroll Offices.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              31


     1.8.1.1. Air National Guard payroll offices are generally located in ANG financial management
     offices. AFRES payroll offices are generally located in financial management/tenant unit budget
     offices identified by the CBPO PAS (see USAF PAS Directory).
     1.8.1.2. The payroll office for HPSP students is the AFRES RC payroll office located at Denver
     CO. IMAs are serviced by the AFRES RC payroll office selected by the member. The AFRES RC
     payroll office at Denver also inputs DJMS-RC transactions not available in the AFRES Data Col-
     lection System.

     1.8.2.4. AFRES units are encouraged to provide full payroll support to the IMAs described in
     1.8.2.1., “Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) – Categories A, B, and D,” however, the
     remaining individual Reservists should be referred to the AFRES RC payroll office in Denver CO,
     for service.
     1.8.2.5. AFRES payroll offices mail documents (DD Form 114, DD Form 139, etc.) to DFAS-DE/
     FJPA for payments or adjustments of pay and allowances that are not computerized. See Chapter
     4, “Supporting Document Files (SDF)” for forms and the transactions they support.
  1.8.3. ANG Payroll Office.
     1.8.3.1. The input system is the Integrated Military Personnel System (IMPS).

     (ANGRC/FMFP) for contingency procedures.
     1.8.3.3. ANG transmits their data via the Systems Enhancement Associates PC Software commu-
     nications package (SEADog).
     1.8.3.4. Pay transactions may be submitted daily to DFAS-DE via SEADog. Each payroll office
     has an established transmission time.

     1.8.5. Reserve Programs. Although there are many distinct programs, the term IMA will be generi-
     cally used to refer to all the following pay categories:
        1.8.5.1. Individual Mobilization Augumentee (IMA) – Categories A, B, and D. Officers and air-
        men assigned to positions which would be used to backfill the active duty in the event of mobili-

   1.8.6. Directorate of Military Pay (DFAS-DE/FJ).
      1.8.6.1. Inputs data for payments which have not been decentralized to the payroll offices or have
      not been computerized. See Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”.
      1.8.6.2. Inputs data for payments and adjustments to pay and allowances when management
      notices are received for dates of performance outside of immediate access storage (IAS). (IAS is
      current processing month plus 11 prior months).

1.9. Computer Processing Schedules.
   1.9.1. DFAS-DE schedules dates for DJMS-RC computer processing and distributes an annual oper-
   ations calendar showing computer run dates, code type, voucher date, and the highest date paid for
   each update within the year. DFAS-DE/FJ distributes changes to these schedules by message.
   1.9.2. Active duty tours less than 30 days, which have an end date past the high-date-paid on the
   schedule, may be processed in advance if properly certified; however, the tour payment will recycle
   until the appropriate scheduled run.
   1.9.3. Three types of computer runs are normally scheduled each month. The three types of computer
   updates are:
      1.9.3.1. Code 1. Payment of IDT, miscellaneous entitlements, short tours of active duty, adjust-
      ments for payments or collections, and update of MMPA with personnel and entitlement data. This
      will also “catch up” long tours. This will not pay BMT tours.
      1.9.3.2. Code 2. All payments described for the code 1, plus long tours of active duty for pay due
      from the first or intermediate day through the 15th of the month.
      1.9.3.3. Code 3. All payments described for the code 1 and code 2, plus long tour of active duty
      for pay due from the 16th or intermediate day of the month through the last day of the month. This
      also pays advanced certified tours where payments are delivered to a pay agent for distribution to
      the members at their annual training duty site.
          1.9.3.3.1. The Code 3 computer run is the only run that lists advanced certified tours. Advance
          certified tours are also paid on Code 1 and Code 2.
          1.9.3.3.2. Payments from the code 1, 2, or 3 runs may be sent to a financial organization
          (direct deposit) or to the mailing address in the MMPA.

1.10. Daily Transactions.
   1.10.1. General Procedures for Working Daily Transactions.
34                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


        1.10.1.1. Transactions are validated for format and consistency, i.e., data reported in correct data
        fields (card columns), valid SSN, and name. In addition, transactions are validated against infor-
        mation provided on the member’s MMPA. Transactions failing these edits are rejected back to the
        payroll office which has overall responsibility for the MMPA. The rejects are listed on report PCN
        UH022-164, with a narrative message explaining the error appearing directly below the transac-
        tion.
        1.10.1.2. All valid transactions process through pay computation and update of the pay history file
        and the member’s MMPA.
        1.10.1.3. DJMS-RC outgoing AUTODIN for PCARS is sent out daily. Each transmission is num-
        bered sequentially. Contact Operations Branch, Liaison Division, Directorate of Military Pay
        (DFAS-DE/FJY), AUTOVON/DSN 926-6468, for any questions concerning AUTODIN.
        1.10.1.4. All errors and management notices on the UH022-164 must be annotated to indicate
        what actions were taken and when they were completed. If no action is required, then it must be
        explained. Aggressive follow-up action must be taken to clear any item shown. Retain copies of
        error listings for three (3) months after the month in which all errors and/or management notices
        on the listing are cleared.
        1.10.1.5. ARPC gets a hardcopy of UH022-164 and can inquire this report via RMS.
     1.10.2. Additional Procedures – AFRES Only.
        1.10.2.1. AFRES payroll offices retrieve error files from the AFRES Data Collection System on a
        daily basis. The error file must be printed and date-stamped daily.
        1.10.2.2. All errors and management notices on the UH022-164 must be annotated to indicate
        what actions were taken and when they were completed. If no action is required, then it must be
        explained. Aggressive follow-up action must be taken to clear any item shown.
        1.10.2.3. Retain copies of error listings for three (3) months after the month in which all errors
        and/or management notices on the listing are cleared.
     1.10.3. Additional Procedures – ANG Only. ANG payroll offices retrieve management and error files
     from DFAS-DE/FJR daily via SEADog. Required corrective action should be processed promptly.
     Management products received via SEADog will be compared to the UH0122-164 (see Appendix D,
     “DJMS-RC Reports”) microfiche report to ensure all reports are received and processed.

1.11. DD Form 114, Military Pay Orders (MPO) Preparation.
     1.11.1. Use certified DD Form 114, Military Pay Orders, signed by a commander, for pay adjustments
     or collections that are not computerized or have not been decentralized to the payroll office (see
     Chapter 27, “Pay Adjustments”, Chapter 32, “Accounts Receivable – Debt Accounts”, and Chapter
     43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”).
     1.11.2. Datafax copies are acceptable, however; the faxed MPO must be signed by a certifying
     officer. The faxed MPO does not constitute priority action; cases are opened as received and thereby
     worked in Julian date order. The original hardcopy MPO doesn’t need to be forwarded as this causes
     duplicate cases and possible duplicate postings.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                               35


       1.11.2.1. Prepare the DD Form 114 in original and two copies. Include DJMS-RC and PAS code
       on all DD Forms 114s. Example: DJMS-RC/H9. The DD Form 114 number should be prefaced
       with the PAS code of the requesting payroll office.
       1.11.2.2. Submit the original and one copy to DFAS-DE/FJPA.
       1.11.2.3. Destroy the file copy six (6) months after the action is closed, or when no longer needed,
       whichever is sooner.
       1.11.2.4. Supporting documents are not required with the DD Form 114 if the statement, “Sup-
       porting documents on file,” is stated on the DD Form 114. However, if the circumstances do not
       appear to justify payment, DFAS-DE/FJPA may require an explanation or submission of docu-
       ments.
       1.11.2.5. Second request messages (follow-up) should be sent to the appropriate DFAS-DE/FJ
       division (three-letter level) after 30 calendar days. If the case remains unsettled by the 40th calen-
       dar day, a third request message should be send directly to DFAS-DE/FJ. All second and third
       request messages should inform the appropriate command support function (for ANG, ANGRC/
       FMFP; for AFRES, HQ AFRES/FMFQ). These procedures should be followed for all normal and
       routine pay inquiries.
       1.11.2.6. Any transaction involving financial hardship, commander/IG interest, or any other trans-
       action which, in the payroll office’s opinion, is not routine or normal, should be so identified and
       immediately brought to the attention of the appropriate DFAS-DE/FJ division.

1.12. Purpose, Type, and Designation of Certifying Officers. All payments and deductions on behalf
of the United States government require written evidence of pay entitlement, performance of duty, or
amount due the United States government. The signature of the certifying officer attests to the correctness
of statements, facts, accounts, and amounts on vouchers or other documents supporting pay and allow-
ances. For the DJMS-RC system, there are three different certifying officers for different purposes. Each
is governed by slightly different procedures.

     ning of each fiscal year.
  1.14.5. Changes in Certifying Officer. A change in the commander does not require a change in pay-
  ing agent. If the new commander desires a change in paying agent, the commander prepares a new DD

  1.14.6. HQ AFRES Self-Inspection Procedures. AFRES payroll office supervisor/lead technician will
  complete the HQ AFRES Self-Inspection Checklist once each fiscal quarter. This responsibility can-
  not be delegated. The checklist is designed to solicit a “Yes/No” response. In the event there is “No”
  response, provide a fully supported answer with an adequate description which clearly identifies the
  problem and states the corrective action taken/planned:
     1.14.6.1. Within 15 calendar days after completing the checklist, the Reserve Pay supervisor/lead
     technician will give their supervisor a written certification that the checklist has been completed.
     The certification will include a summary of the findings.
     1.14.6.2. Since this is a self-inspection, there is no requirement to report the results to HQ
     AFRES/FMFQ; however, submission of findings is encouraged so that problems and solutions
     can be crossfed to other AFRES payroll offices. Retain the completed checklist, documentation of
     identified problems, corrective action taken, and the certification for two years.

                                                 Chapter 2

           ESTABLISH/MAINTAIN A DJMS-RC MASTER MILITARY PAY ACCOUNT

2.1. Purpose. This chapter provides basic guidance and procedures necessary to establish, maintain, and
close a Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) for a member of the Air National Guard (ANG) or Air
Force Reserves (AFRES). Special programs are covered in Chapter 34, “Special Programs”

2.2. Gains.
     2.2.1. Definition of Gains.
        2.2.1.1. Each member reassigned from one component of the armed forces to another.
        2.2.1.2. Officers appointed upon completion of officer training school (OTS) or given a direct
        commission.
        2.2.1.3. Non-prior service enlistees.
        2.2.1.4. All prior-service airmen enlistees.
        2.2.1.5. Members reassigned from non-pay status to pay status.
        2.2.1.6. Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) tours terminating or paying out in JSS-AC and reverting
        DJMS-RC for pay purposes. NOTE: In most instances, AGR members are paid on JSS-AC.
        2.2.1.7. HPSP, FAP, and STRAP participant.
        2.2.1.8. ROTC Participants.
     2.2.2. Personnel Data System (PDS).
        2.2.2.1. PDS provides AUTODIN input of data common to both pay and personnel. CBPO pre-
        pares PDS gain cards (see AFMAN 36-2621 V4, for AFRES and ANGM 30-3 for ANG). This
        data is input to PDS by the CBPO and includes the data shown in Table 43.33.
        2.2.2.2. PDS may also provide the A07 and A08 transactions via AUTODIN. (See Table 2.7. and
        Table 2.8., respectively, for the A07 and A08 transaction formats.)
     2.2.3. RC Payroll Office. Inputs data to complete gains for members of the units/organizations it sup-
     ports when PDS has not submitted the A07 and A08 transactions. TINs A07 and A08 must be submit-
     ted as a pair. Both transactions must be present before DJMS-RC will allow them to process. The RC
     payroll office transmits data to DFAS-DE via dedicated payroll transmissions from HQ AFRES or
     ANG units. See Table 2.6., Table 2.7., and Table 2.8., respectively, for instructions on preparing A06,
     A07, and A08 transactions. See 34.2., “Section B – Health Profession Scholarship Program (HPSP),
     Financial Assistance Program (FAP), and Specialized Training Assistance Program (STRAP) Individ-
     uals. An additional transaction (A05) is necessary to establish the student master file for HPIP and
     ROTC participants.
        2.2.3.1. City Names and ZIP-Plus 4. Cities reported with more than 13 characters will automati-
        cally be converted to 13 or less characters by DFAS-DE. Zip codes will automatically be
        expanded to nine digits by DFAS-DE. See Chapter 7, “Mailing Address”, for a complete expla-
        nation of how the ZIP-Plus 4 software updates the member’s zip code and mailing address.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           39


     2.2.3.2. If the RC payroll office must process the A07 and A08 transactions (see Table 2.7. and
     Table 2.8., respectively) to preclude misrouting of a pending payment, the PC payroll office must
     immediately notify the CBPO of the exact date of the input of these transactions. TINs A07 and
     A08 must be submitted as a pair.
        2.2.3.2.1. Processing A08 and A10 transactions:
            2.2.3.2.1.1. A08 transactions must be input with an address type:
                2.2.3.2.1.1.1. Domestic Address
                2.2.3.2.1.1.2. Foreign Address
                2.2.3.2.1.1.3. APO Address
                2.2.3.2.1.1.4. FPO Address
            2.2.3.2.1.2. If the member has an address type 2 – foreign address, an A10 transaction
            must accompany the A08 transaction. The A10 transaction contains the foreign country
            and an information line of address.
                2.2.3.2.1.2.1. The foreign country must be spelled out, for example, Great Britain not
                GB. Remember this data will print on the member’s LES, W-2, etc. A foreign address
                would appear as follows:


                           John Brown
                           11 Bramford Road
                           Ipswich IP121JD
                           Great Britain


                2.2.3.2.1.2.2. The information line is optional. When desired it will be printed under
                the member’s name on the LES, W-2, etc. This information line is for data that is not
                included in the street address or city, state, and zip area. For example, the information
                line could be – Post 3J9, Bldg 444. The member’s address would appear on the LES as:


                           John Brown
                           Post 3J9 Bldg 444
                           6760 East Irvington Place
                           Denver CO 80279-5000
40                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


                    2.2.3.2.1.2.3. A member could have an information line and a foreign country. It
                    would appear as:


                                John Brown
                                Bramford Gardens
                                11 Bramford Road
                                Ipswich IP121JD
                                Great Britain


            2.2.3.2.2. Changing an address with a foreign country. A new A07 and A08 must be submitted
            for a change. The address type would be changed on the A08 transaction. This change to a
            domestic address will also delete the A10 record.
            2.2.3.2.3. Information changes. A member with a domestic address can have an A10 submit-
            ted at any time to change the information line. The new information line will overlay the pre-
            vious information.
        2.2.3.3. Erroneous SSN.
            2.2.3.3.1. When a member is totally gained with an erroneous SSN, notify the servicing
            CBPO to process a SSN change. Do not resubmit gain transactions under the new SSN.
            2.2.3.3.2. The SSN change will correct the SSN in the member’s MMPA, Student Master, and
            all pay history files. The transaction will not process until the first daily run after coded update.
            2.2.3.3.3. All account data will be updated to reflect the correct (new) SSN. Any new transac-
            tions must be input using the new/corrected SSN. Any adjustments to payments made under
            the old/erroneous SSN must be input using the new/corrected SSN.
            2.2.3.3.4. If PDS has the correct SSN and DJMS-RC is wrong, send a message to DFAS-DE/
            FJPA requesting correction.
        2.2.3.4. Erroneous Name. The name change will correct the name in the member’s MMPA, Stu-
        dent Master, and all pay history files. Name changes may only be submitted through PDS, HQ
        AFROTC, or done by DFAS-DE/FJPR. See Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions D01,
        D02, and PDS” for more information.

2.3. Pay Status.
     2.3.1. A member is gained in a “normal” pay status (Code A), which means the pay record is ready to
     accept transactions to pay unit training assemblies (UTAs)/inactive duty trainings (IDT) and short
     tours of active duty. (See Table 9.1. for codes and definitions.)
     2.3.2. To report the member absent without leave (AWOL) (Code B) or establish reoccurring pay-
     ments for school tours of over 30 days (Code T), etc., the pay status must be changed. (See Table 9.1.
     for codes and definitions).
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                               41


       2.3.2.1. At the end of the specified period for the change in pay status, the pay record automati-
       cally reverts back to “normal” (Code A) for all but Code B. See Table 9.1. for codes and defini-
       tions.
       2.3.2.2. Code B, AWOL, does not automatically revert back to a Code A. See Table 9.1. for codes
       and definitions.
   2.3.3. The pay status for HPSP, FAP, and ROTC reverts to “X” (stipend or subsistence) when the
   active duty tour is complete (See Chapter 34).
   2.3.4. See the A24 transaction format (see Table 9.5., Table 10.1., and Table 24.26.) for procedures
   and input guidance. For specific pay status actions, see Table 9.1.

2.4. Payment Options.
   2.4.1. Effective 1 September 1989, participation in the direct deposit program became mandatory for
   all new Reserve members and those members reenlisting or gaining officer status after that date. All
   others are highly encouraged to participate in the direct deposit program.
   2.4.2. To sign up or change accounts/banks, members complete an SF1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-Up
   Form.
   2.4.3. See the DoD Directive for those exceptions to direct deposit. Also, see Chapter 7, “Checks and
   Direct Deposit”.

2.5. Changes in Personnel Data. CBPO inputs personnel data changes through PDS. SSN and name
changes will be processed on the first daily update following a code 1, 2, or 3 update. This will ensure that
all transactions input or recycling under the old SSN will process before the MMPA and pay history files
are updated with the new SSN.

2.6. Loss.
   2.6.1. Definition of Loss. Members lost to the pay system are reported by PDS and include those:
       2.6.1.1. Transferred to Nonaffiliated Reserve Section (NARS), Inactive Status List Reserve Sec-
       tion (ISLRS), and Obligated Reserve Section (ORS).
       2.6.1.2. Discharged
       2.6.1.3. Separated
       2.6.1.4. Retired
       2.6.1.5. Deceased (Separations/Special Actions Division, Directorate of Military Pay Operations
       (DFAS-DE/FJPS) input only).
       2.6.1.6. Individually recalled to active duty (AD) for 180 days or more.
       2.6.1.7. Mobilized members or individually recalled to active duty members remain on the
       DJMS-RC file.
       2.6.1.8. Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) members entering active duty and paid under DJMS-AC.
       2.6.1.9. HPSP, FAP, and ROTC graduates.
42                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


2.7. Separated Accounts. MMPAs are purged once a year on the first daily after the end of calendar year
close-out. MMPAs with date of separation (DOS) that are more than one year old will be dropped from
DJMS-RC, at the time mentioned above.
     2.7.1. The MMPA must contain a date of separation (DOS) and the loss indicators must equal “LL”.
     2.7.2. If the member is an AGR and the active duty stop date is over a year from the purge run-date
     the MMPA will be purged.
     2.7.3. Pay transactions continue to process against an account until the MMPA is dropped from the
     system, as long as the dates of performance are on or before DOS.
     2.7.4. After DJMS-RC drops an account, the servicing RC payroll office must submit an MPO to
     DFAS-DE/FJPR for manual payments and collections.

2.8. Reactivated MMPAs.
     2.8.1. PDS Actions. If PDS has processed a gain transaction (TIN AA1) and the effective date is
     greater than the MMPA separation and assignment dates, the MMPA will automatically be reactivated
     if the MMPA is still on the DJMS-RC system (see 2.7., “Separated Accounts”). A master file for
     review will be generated along with a management notice requiring the payroll office to completely
     review the MMPA for accuracy.
        2.8.1.1. A PDS gain transaction submitted with an effective date less than the MMPA separation
        and assignment dates will reject.
        2.8.1.2. If, however, PDS has not processed a gain transaction and the MMPA has not been
        dropped from the system, the RC payroll office may reactivate the member’s MMPA using the
        A09 (See Table 2.12.) transaction. See 2.8.2., “Payroll Office Actions” below.
        2.8.1.3. PDS must reactivate the member’s records if there is a PDS error involving the former
        loss.
     2.8.2. Payroll Office Actions.
        2.8.2.1. Reactivate – MMPA for AFR/ANG – Reserve Status
            2.8.2.1.1. A payroll office must process an A09 transaction to change member’s PEC, PAS, or
            ST-PGMA as necessary. See, also, 2 below. See Table 2.12. for the A09 transaction.
            2.8.2.1.2. The payroll office reactivation of a pay record (see A09 in Table 2.12.) causes an
            MMPA to be printed on PCN UH022-176. The RC payroll office must review the MMPA to
            verify entitlement and deduction data, with particular emphasis on pay date and grade, and
            Direct Deposit account information, before processing any tours for payment.
            2.8.2.1.3. If the record has been dropped and PDS transactions have not successfully reacti-
            vated the record, the payroll office sends a message to DFAS-DE/FJPA requesting the MMPA
            be reestablished.
        2.8.2.2. Reactivate the MMPA – AGR Status (ANG Only).
            2.8.2.2.1. DFAS-DE/FJPA processes an AA1 transaction (see Table 43.33.) and the RC pay-
            roll office completes the accession A06, A07, and A08 transactions. (See Table 2.6., Table
            2.7., and Table 2.8., respectively, for the A06, A07, and A08 formats.)
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           43


              2.8.2.2.1.1. If the member has completed the AGR tour, then the payroll office inputs the
              A06, A07, and A08 transactions to reactivate the record.
              2.8.2.2.1.2. If the member returns early from the AGR tour, the payroll office first pro-
              cesses an A24 transaction, with pay status “K” to adjust the date of separation on
              JUMPS-AC. Then the payroll office processes the A06, A07, and A08. (See Table 9.5. for
              the A24 format.)
              2.8.2.2.1.3. Then, the payroll office processes an A09 transaction (see Table 2.12.) to
              reflect the new assignment date and a leave only A06 transaction (see Table 29.10.) to post
              any leave entitlements.
              2.8.2.2.1.4. Follow instructions in 2.4. above for MMPA review.
          2.8.2.2.2. For members whose DJMS-RC MMPA has been dropped from the system, see 2.7.,
          “Separated Accounts”.
      2.8.2.3. Reactivate – MMPA for HPSP, FAP, and STRAP Participants. The A09 transaction will
      not be used to ‘reactivate’ the HPSP, FAP, STRAP, and ROTC participants in a non-dual status. To
      reactivate an MMPA, use the A05 transaction by changing the graduation date. (See Chapter 34,
      “Special Programs”.)

2.9. Individual Changes to PEC/PAS/ST-PGMA.
   2.9.1. The RC payroll office submits A09 transactions (see Table 2.12.) for individual changes of
   Individual Change to Program Element Code (PEC), Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS), or State/
   Pay Group – Mobilization Augmentee Code (ST-PGMA).
   2.9.2. The A09 transaction will not be used to ‘change’ PEC/PAS/ST-PGMA for HPSP, FAP, STRAP,
   and ROTC participants in a non-dual status. Use the A05 transaction to change PEC/PAS/ST-PGMA
   (see Chapter 34, “Special Programs”).
   2.9.3. See 1.4., “ST-PGMA, PAS, and PEC Change(s)” for mass conversion of PAS, PEC, and
   ST-PGMA changes.

2.10. Reassignments and Transfers.
   2.10.1. Procedures for members reassigned from one responsible payroll office to another, including
   ANG members transferring from one state to another, and members transferring between the ANG
   and USAFR, who remain in pay status, are listed below.
   2.10.2. The A09 transaction will not be used to ‘transfer’ HPSP, FAP, STRAP, and ROTC participants
   in a non-dual status. Use the A05 the transaction to change programs (see Chapter 34, “Special Pro-
   grams”).
   2.10.3. Losing Activity. The RC payroll office submits all transactions effecting payment for duty
   performed prior to the effective date of the transfer.
   2.10.4. Gaining Activity.
      2.10.4.1. Active Reserve Gains. The RC payroll office processes any transactions required as a
      result of the transfer. For example:
44                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            2.10.4.1.1. To change the member’s PEC, PAS, or ST-PGMA. (See 2.9., “Individual Changes
            to PEC/PAS/ST-PGMA” and the A09 transaction at Table 2.12.)
            2.10.4.1.2. ANG member transfers from one state to another or from the USAFR to the ANG
            and member desires State Sponsored Life Insurance (SSLI). (See 31.2., “Section B – ANG
            State Sponsored Group Life Insurance (SSLI)” and the A42 transaction at Table 31.4.)
            2.10.4.1.3. To change the organizational or personal mailing address; direct deposit informa-
            tion; and/or to change member’s earning statement, TD Form W-2, or check mailing address.
            See Chapter 7, “Checks and Direct Deposit”; Table 2.7. and Table 2.8. for the A07 and A08
            formats. See Table 30.3. for the A26 formats. See A18 (Table 7.1.) for the direct deposit for-
            mat.
        2.10.4.2. Inactive Reserve Gains. If member is coming from S7, inactive Reserve, to an active
        unit, the gain transaction must come through PDS.
     2.10.5. Management Reports.
        2.10.5.1. When a member is on direct deposit and an A09 transaction (see Table 2.12.) is submit-
        ted to transfer a member from one CBPO to another, an MMPA for review is generated and sent to
        the payroll office which input the A09 via the UH022-176 report, with message “CONFIRM
        DIRECT DEPOSIT”.
        2.10.5.2. If the A09 transaction (see Table 2.12.) is input by DFAS-DE, the “MMPA FOR
        REVIEW” is output on the UH022-120 report.
        2.10.5.3. In addition to the “MMPA FOR REVIEW”, a reference message, “MBR TRANS-
        FER-REVIEW-CONFIRM DIRECT DEPOSIT”, is generated:
            2.10.5.3.1. If the input is done by DFAS-DE, the reference message is output on the
            UH022-116 report.
            2.10.5.3.2. If the input is done by the field, the reference message is output on the UH022-164
            report, Part I and Part II.

2.11. MMPA History Description.
     2.11.1. The MMPA history contains entitlements, deductions, and a 12-month calendar pay record
     containing activities for the current month and the previous 11 months.
     2.11.2. See paragraph 34.6., “Section F – Student Master for HPIP/ROTC Students”.
     2.11.3. Calendar. The calendar provides two attendance periods per day. The attendance codes are
     posted to the calendar when payments are made and are deleted to show no attendance when collec-
     tion is made. The “Combined Items” code shows how the data actually appears on the MMPA calen-
     dar. See Table 2.1. for the basic values and Table 2.2. for combined values and their definitions.
     2.11.4. Counters. The counters are located in the first block of data on the MMPA. The counter con-
     sists of a total of five positions, three gain positions and two loss positions.
        2.11.4.1. Gain Counters.
            2.11.4.1.1. The first gain counter is for PDS-gain data; the second and third gain counters are
            for DJMS-RC-gain data. The first gain counter position is posted with a “G” upon receipt and
            processing of PDS-gain data (AA1 transaction, see Table 43.33.). A record with only one “G”
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             45


          in the first gain counter position indicates that PDS data has been received; the file is then
          waiting for the required payroll office data to complete the record.
          2.11.4.1.2. The second gain position is posted with a “G” after the payroll office processes tax
          information, BAQ status, leave information, sex code, the number of UTAs authorized, etc.,
          on the A06 (see Table 2.6.) from the RC payroll office.
          2.11.4.1.3. The third gain position is posted with a “G” after the address information, submit-
          ted on the A07 and A08 (see Table 2.7. and Table 2.8.) is posted.
       2.11.4.2. Loss Counters.
          2.11.4.2.1. The two loss counters are posted as “LL” upon receipt of the PDS loss (900 trans-
          action).
          2.11.4.2.2. .The two loss counters indicate that the MMPA is closed; however, it remains in
          the system until the DOS is greater than 6 months from the current processing month, (see 2.7.,
          “Separated Accounts”).
          2.11.4.2.3. RC payroll offices may continue to process any pay transactions against these
          “LL” records as long as the dates of performance are on or before the date of separation
          (DOS).
          2.11.4.2.4. If member is deceased (pay status N), a DD Form 114 is required if pay is due.
          When DJMS-RC drops the MMPA, the RC payroll office submits a DD Form 114 to
          DFAS-DE/FJPS to process manual payments and collections. See Table 9.1. for pay status
          codes and definitions.
          2.11.4.2.5. Processing an A05 (See Table 34.1.) with a graduation will post the “LL” loss
          counter to the MMPA for HPSP, FAP, STRAP, and ROTC participants who are not in a dual
          status.

2.12. Correction of Records. The member determines need and prepares a DD Form 149, Application
for Correction of Military Record, with supporting documents per AFI 31-3, Air Force Board for Correc-
tion of Military Records. The member may obtain assistance and documents from the RC payroll office
and/or CBPO and forwards the completed application to:

   2.12.1. HQ AFMPC/DPMOA1. HQ AFMPC/DPMOA1 reviews the application to determine the
   office of primary responsibility (OPR), based on subject of application. The OPR determines whether
   or not administrative action can be taken; if so, acts to correct. If not, the OPR forwards application,
   with a recommendation to approve or disapprove the application, to the Air Force Board for Correc-
   tion of Military Records (AFBCMR), Washington, DC 20330-1430. The board processes the applica-
   tion per AFI 36-2603.

       2.12.2.1. The AFBCMR rules on the application and returns the approval/disapproval to the OPR.
             2.12.2.1.1. If the application is disapproved, the OPR notifies the member and no further
             action is necessary.
             2.12.2.1.2. If the application is approved and there is a monetary impact to the member, the
             OPR forwards the decision and pertinent back-up material to the member’s servicing payroll
             office.
             2.12.2.1.3. The payroll office prepares an DD Form 114 with supporting documents, forwards
             the package to the appropriate DFAS-DE directorate for payment, and notifies the member
             that his/her case is being processed for payment.
       2.12.2.2. If the payment due is for a period before the date of the AFBCMR directive, the package
       is forwarded to Special Actions Branch, Claims Division, Directorate of Debt and Claims Man-
       agement(DFAS-DE/FYCT), 6760 E. Irvington Place, Denver CO 80279-3000.
             2.12.2.2.1. DFAS-DE/FYCT makes payment for the period from the date of the correction to
             the date of the directive.
             2.12.2.2.2. If further payment is due for periods beyond the date of the directive, DFAS-DE/
             FYCT forwards a copy for payment to DFAS-DE/FJPR.
       2.12.2.3. If the payment due is for a period on or after the directive, the package is forwarded to
       DFAS-DE/FJPR for payment.
       2.12.2.4. DFAS-DE takes final action on correction of records (see Table 2.3.).

          DOCUMENTATION PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION PROCEDURES

3.1. Documentation.
   3.1.1. Source Documents. Source documents used for preparing DJMS-RC input data are supporting
   documents for the DJMS-RC transactions. Supporting documentation, to include system certified data
   from collateral systems, (e.g., PDS) is required for each pay and allowance transaction.
      3.1.1.1. The RC payroll offices and DFAS-DE/FJP must keep and retire the supporting documents
      for DJMS-RC input.
      3.1.1.2. Documents used to support RC members being paid by JUMPS (See Chapter 24, “Pay-
      ments by DJMS-AC”) are retired with JUMPS documents.
   3.1.2. Control Logs. RC payroll offices maintain the MPO and leave accounting control logs for one
   (1) fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year, review the logs for outstanding documents and obtain
   missing documents. After reconciliation, close the logs and retire with DJMS-RC supporting docu-
   ments. Open new logs starting with number one for the next fiscal year.

3.2. Retirement and Retrieval of Documents.
   3.2.1. Retirement. Refer to AFMAN 37-139, Volume I, Disposition of Air Force Documentation –
   Policies, Procedures, and Responsibilities, Chart 4-1, and Volume II, Disposition of Air Force
   Records – Records Disposition Schedule, Table 177-25, and local instructions, for proper procedures
   for retiring DJMS-RC documents.
   3.2.2. Retrieval Procedures.
      3.2.2.1. Prior to September 1991, RC payroll offices sent documents to DFAS-DE for retirement.
      Since then, ANG and AFRES documents have been retired locally based upon agreements made
      with the host base. The AFRES RC payroll office in Denver CO, continues to use the services of
      DFAS-DE.
      3.2.2.2. To request information or documents which have been retired through DFAS-DE, the RC
      payroll office sends the request to Records Maintenance Section, Records Management Branch,
      Administrative Support Division, Director of Support Services, (DFAS-DE/WADR), for process-
      ing. The following information must be included:
      3.2.2.3. Dates of retirement and receipt of documents as noted on your receipted copy of SF 135,
      Records Transmittal and Receipt.
      3.2.2.4. Member’s name, SSN, (or service number, if documents are dated prior to 1 July 1969).
      3.2.2.5. Reason data or document is needed.
      3.2.2.6. Inclusive dates of duty included in the request.
          3.2.2.6.1. To request information or documents which have been retired locally, refer to local
          instructions.

3.3. Data Input/Transmission.
     3.3.1. Input Transmissions. Input into DJMS-RC is sent to DFAS-DE by transmission from ANG
     units and HQ AFRES; or by mail.
        3.3.1.1. All PDS data is transmitted via AUTODIN.
        3.3.1.2. AFRES payroll offices cannot transmit via AUTODIN.
        3.3.1.3. ANG payroll activities have retained the capability of transmitting input through AUTO-
        DIN.
NOTE: Contact DFAS-DE/FJY before attempting to transmit payroll office data pay via AUTODIN or
mail.
     3.3.2. Dedicated Payroll Transmissions – Input Subsystems. The ANG and AFRES have developed
     separate subsystems for transmitting payroll data. Any changes to these subsystems must be coordi-
     nated with DFAS-DE/FJR prior to implementation.
        3.3.2.1. ANG Data Collection Network.
            3.3.2.1.1. If transmission is by the ANG Data Collection Network (SEADog), no restrictions
            apply on the number of transmissions submitted in a single pay file to DFAS-DE.
            3.3.2.1.2. Multiple pay file transmissions are permitted in a single day, but each must have a
            unique pay file number. Using the same file number will overwrite the previous pay file with
            the same number.
            3.3.2.1.3. At the same time as the payroll transactions are transmitted to DFAS-DE, reject and
            management notice reports are retrieved. See Chapter 5, “Rejects and Management Notices”
            and the Error Message Manual for additional information on processing necessary adjustments
            or corrections.
            3.3.2.1.4. Compare reports received via SEADog to microfiche products to insure all reports
            are processed.
            3.3.2.1.5. All pay transmission problems must be addressed to ANGRC/FMF.
        3.3.2.2. AFRES Data Collection Network. AFRES transmissions are sent by each payroll office
        to a mini-computer located at HQ AFRES/FMP, Robins AFB, GA. The transmissions are automat-
        ically reorganized into the required format and then retransmitted to DFAS-DE.
            3.3.2.2.1. Payroll offices can transmit up to eight (8) times per business day.
            3.3.2.2.2. Transmission problems must be addressed to HQ AFRES/FMFQ.
            3.3.2.2.3. AFRES Payroll offices receive acknowledgment of transmitted pay transactions via
            the Comptroller Information Transfer System (CITS).
            3.3.2.2.4. HQ AFRES/FMFQ receives the DJMS-RC data from DFAS-DE.
            3.3.2.2.5. Payroll offices access CITS to download the management notice information, and
            flow it into the AFRES Data Collection System per system menu instructions.
            3.3.2.2.6. Management of this system, transmission scheduling, and procedural application(s)
            are the responsibility of HQ AFRES/FMP and FMFQ.

     3.3.2.3. AFRES RC Payroll Office at Denver. AFRES RC payroll office at Denver submits their
     transmissions through HQ AFRES. Those transactions which are unavailable on the AFRES Data
     Collection Software are sent to the JSS Special Systems Branch, JSS Update Systems Division,
     Denver Financial Systems Activity Directorate (FSADE/JD), via dedicated Hewlett-Packard pay
     terminals or through batch processing from an internal mini-computer.
  3.3.3. Transactions Not Processing/Blocking Transactions.
     3.3.3.1. If a system problem is identified and certain transactions cannot be processed into a pay-
     roll update, DFAS-DE has the capability of blocking those transactions. The transactions will be
     held or recycled until the problem is resolved and the transactions can be processed. The recycles
     will appear on PCN: UH022-116 and UH022-164, Part II.

                              REJECTS AND MANAGEMENT NOTICES

5.1. Error Codes. For specific information on error codes, refer to Error Message Manual, which is
attached as a separate manual. (This manual will be published at a later time.)
     5.1.1. Rejects.
        5.1.1.1. Rejects to the payroll office occur when the transaction fails the DJMS-RC systems edits,
        either because of mismatch of information, erroneous codes in the transactions, or payment/action
        has already occurred for the dates in the transaction.
        5.1.1.2. The payroll office will have to research the transaction and supporting document informa-
        tion, as well as the member’s MMPA, to insure all data in the transaction is correct.
     5.1.2. Management Notices.
        5.1.2.1. Management notices are generated each time a transaction rejects to the operating direc-
        torate at DFAS-DE for their action. These notices are also manually generated when cases are
        opened on the Automated Case Control System (ACCS), based on DD Forms 139, Pay Adjust-
        ment Authorization, letters, messages, etc.
        5.1.2.2. Use these notices to track rejected transactions through the system.
     5.1.3. Types of Cases.
        5.1.3.1. HCPY (hardcopy) – Military pay orders
        5.1.3.2. LTR (letter) – Other adjustments, DD 139s, TWXs
        5.1.3.3. PYMTS (payments) – Special projects
        5.1.3.4. BONDS – Unit rejects for DFAS-DE action
        5.1.3.5. CHEK (checks) – Master record for review
        5.1.3.6. INQY (inquiry) – Miscellaneous cases
     5.1.4. FELS Error Report. The front end loader system (FELS) became a part of DJMS-RC process-
     ing in November 1994. FELS does a cursory review of all incoming transactions to insure that the
     PAS code data is in the correct field, calculates money amounts for some transactions created in the
     reserve component input system (RCIS), and provides a count of processed and rejected transactions
     within FELS. This report is created for every daily and coded update to DJMS-RC.
        5.1.4.1. For Army, FELS provides a Command Pay Management Report.
        5.1.4.2. For both Army and Air Force, FELS provides a FELS Error Report, UH022-205
        (Replaces UH022-2002). This report shows, by the first two positions of the PAS, any transactions
        rejected because of the edits done in FELS. It also shows transactions received by the first two
        positions of the PAS, total rejected and passed to DJMS-RC.
        5.1.4.3. FELS edits transactions that cross a fiscal year and creates two transactions – each
        self-contained within a specific fiscal year. The UH022-205 report provides a count, by PAS, of all
        transactions “added” by FELS.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          77


      5.1.4.4. The FELS Error Report may be viewed on both RMS and the new Sysout Archive
      Retrieval System (SAR). It is not provided in print format to Air Force.

5.2. Error Correction Timeliness/Processing.
   5.2.1. AFRES Payroll offices are expected to correct and retransmit 95 percent of the errors and man-
   agement notices listed on the UH022-164 within two (2) workdays (or the error listing must be anno-
   tated to indicate what actions were taken).
   5.2.2. Retain copies of error listings retrieved from HQ AFRES in the RC payroll office for three (3)
   months following the month in which all errors and management notices on the listing are cleared.
   5.2.3. When corrections still do not process, contact DFAS-DE/FJRR, DSN 926-6143, or DFAS-DE/
   FJP, DSN 926-7345.

                                                Chapter 7

                                CHECKS AND DIRECT DEPOSIT

7.1. Payment Options.
   7.1.1. Direct Deposit.
      7.1.1.1. Reference AFR 177-20, Direct Deposit of Pay Program.
      7.1.1.2. Effective 1 September 1989, participation in the direct deposit program became manda-
      tory for all new Air Force active duty, ANG, Air Reserve members, and those members reenlisting
      or gaining officer status after that date.
      7.1.1.3. Mobilized members are also considered to have had a “change of status” under the guide-
      lines of the mandatory program and are required to have direct deposit.
      7.1.1.4. Direct deposit continues to be required when the member demobilizes.
      7.1.1.5. All others are highly encouraged to participate in the direct deposit program. Reference
      AFR-177-20, Direct Deposit.
   7.1.2. Non-Participants of Direct Deposit.
      7.1.2.1. If the member is not enrolled in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program, DFAS-DE prepares
      and mails checks to member’s personal mailing address.
      7.1.2.2. Waivers for non-participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program may be granted by the
      unit and/or installation commander. Waivers may be granted upon an individual’s request, or may
      be commander-directed due to circumstances in which participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay
      Program is not feasible or practical.
      7.1.2.3. A waiver issued by the unit commander at the member’s request may not exceed six (6)
      months. A waiver of greater than 6 months must be approved by the unit’s higher headquarters or
      the installation commander, whichever is applicable. The Direct Deposit of Pay Waiver Report,
      UH022-302, is sent monthly to each unit to identify non-participation and whether a waiver has
      been approved and if so, when it expires.
   7.1.3. Advance Certification and Check Mailing. Encampments that qualify for advance certification
   are processed following procedures in Chapter 9, “Active Duty”. If the C01 transaction is not coded
   for advance certification (Table 9.3., CHECK DISPOSITION field (position 52), code 1) and tour
   end-date has been reached, payment will be made to the financial organization (FO) or the mailing
   address on file in the MMPA – if the member is not on Direct Deposit.

7.2. Checks.
   7.2.1. Checks Returned by the US Postal Service.
      7.2.1.1. The Cashier Branch, Accounting and Finance Division, Director of Support Services
      (DFAS-DE/WFC), provides Disbursement and Collection Branch, Financial Services Division,
      Directorate of Military Pay (DFAS-DE/FJFB), a returned check listing with required information
      regarding undeliverable checks.
144                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         7.2.1.2. DFAS-DE/FJFB researches the MMPA for a later mailing address. If a more current
         address is available, DFAS-DE/FJFB furnishes DFAS-DE/WFC with the new address and the
         check is remailed. If a more current address is not available, the original check is cancelled and
         DFAS-DE/FJFB places the funds into a suspense account awaiting disposition.
      7.2.2. No Current Mailing Address.
         7.2.2.1. Each week, payroll offices are furnished a cumulative report of checks returned to
         DFAS-DE.
         7.2.2.2. The payroll office updates the address or direct deposit fields in the MMPA (organiza-
         tional addresses are not valid for DJMS-RC checks).
         7.2.2.3. Funds will not be released until the MMPA has been updated. Claims received from the
         member without validation from the payroll office will not be processed.
      7.2.3. Unclaimed Checks. If funds held in suspense are not claimed within six (6) months, the pro-
      ceeds are transferred to a Treasury Department receipt account.
      7.2.4. Held Pay for Returned Checks. Refer to paragraph 7.6. for instructions on processing held pay
      for returned checks.
      7.2.5. Non-Receipt, Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Checks. A member must complete an AF Form 326,
      Requests for Replacement Check, requesting that payment be stopped and a substitute United States
      Treasury check be issued. For non-receipt of check, request should be made not earlier than seven (7)
      days after the check date to allow for any mail delays. The AF Form 326 must be validated by the RC
      payroll office and then forwarded to DFAS-DE/WAC. DFAS-DE forwards all requests for replace-
      ment checks to the Treasury Department to be sure the checks have not been cashed. The Treasury
      Department notifies DFAS-DE/WFC of uncashed checks and DFAS-DE/WCF replaces the check(s).
      This process usually takes 60-90 days.
      7.2.6. Checks Older than Six Months. Finance offices will normally not cash checks older than six
      months. The payroll office should send the check and a request for a replacement check to DFAS-DE/
      WFCA, 6760 East Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-3000. Replacement checks will normally be
      issued within one to two weeks. See 7.2.2., “Non-Receipt, Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Checks” for pro-
      cedures on requesting replacement checks.

7.3. Establishing Direct Deposit with SF 1199A.
      7.3.1. General.
         7.3.1.1. Direct Deposit is accomplished by the member through the use of the Department of the
         Treasury Standard Form (SF) 1199A, ‘Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form’, and the input of an A18
         transaction by finance personnel.
         7.3.1.2. The A18 transaction will start, change, or stop the financial organization (FO) that will
         receive or has been receiving the member’s pay. If starting or changing an FO, the A18 transaction
         will use either the company code which has been assigned by DFAS-DE or the Routing Transit
         Number (RTN) which is used by the Federal Reserve Board to send payments to a financial orga-
         nization. See note below.
         7.3.1.3. If the member is changing either the FO or account that will receive the Direct Deposit,
         encourage the member to keep the old account open until the first payment is received in the new
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              145


       account, if possible. Following these procedures will help to ensure the member is not inconve-
       nienced by having a payment returned from an FO which has a closed account for the member.
NOTE: The term, “Routing Transit Number,” is used by the Department of the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve. It is synonymous with the term, “Transit Routing Number” used on the Table 50 inquiry screen.
   7.3.2. Procedures.
       7.3.2.1. Obtain a completed SF 1199A from either the FO which will receive the member’s funds
       or directly from the member. The SF 1199A will contain the member’s name, SSN (Item C, Sec-
       tion 1, claim or payroll ID number, on the SF 1199A), the name and address of the FO, the RTN,
       the type of account (savings or checking), account number, and signature of the FO representative.
       7.3.2.2. When the SF 1199A is received, verify the information as best as possible with the mem-
       ber and using Defense Military Pay System (DJMS), Table 50 (UH022-873). The sort sequence of
       Table 50 is state, city and name of FO within group. Group 1 is banks, savings and loans; Group 2
       is credit unions.
       7.3.2.3. When an A18 transaction is input to start or change the FO, either the company code or
       the RTN must be present. If both are present, the company code and RTN must be for the same
       institution as shown on Table 50, or the A18 transaction will reject. If the input source does not
       have direct access to Table 50 or the microfiche information, the A18 may be input using the
       unverified RTN on the SF 1199A.
       7.3.2.4. After verifying the information on SF 1199A, separate the form. Use the program agency
       copy to process the A18 transaction to start or change the direct deposit data. See Table 7.1. for
       the A18 format.
          7.3.2.4.1. Annotate the company code, if used in the A18 transaction, and the effective date on
          the program agency copy and file in the SDF until the data is verified on the member’s
          MMPA.
          7.3.2.4.2. The SF 1199A recipient’s copy is given to the member.
       7.3.2.5. If an FO cannot be located on Table 50, furnish a list (original and one copy) of such insti-
       tutions used by members to the Direct Deposit Section (DFAS-DE/FJFBA), Disbursement and
       Collection Branch, Financial Services Division, Directorate of Military Pay, 6760 E. Irvington
       Place, Denver, CO 80279-3000.
          7.3.2.5.1. Itemize alphabetically by state, city, and name of FO with full address, including zip
          code, used by the members which are not on Table 50.
          7.3.2.5.2. Leave a space for DFAS-DE to enter the company code. DFAS-DE enters the com-
          pany code, updates Table 50, if necessary, and returns the listing to the submitting RC payroll
          office or Military Personnel Flight (formerly Consolidated Base Personnel Office (CBPO)).
       7.3.2.6. Questions about the use of Table 50 are referred to DFAS-DE/FJFBB, DSN 926-7211.
   7.3.3. EFTS Receipt Problems. Problems related to FO proper receipt of EFTS data should be
   referred to the member’s servicing Federal Reserve Office or, as appropriate, Direct Deposit Section,
   Disbursement and Collection Branch, Financial Services Division, Directorate of Military Pay
   (DFAS-DE/FJFBA), DSN 926-7171.
146                                                                   AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      7.3.4. Held Pay for Returned EFT Payments. Refer to paragraph 7.6. for instructions on processing
      held pay for returned EFT payments.

7.4. Leave and Earnings Statement (LES). DFAS-DE prepares the DFAS Form 702, DFAS Leave and
Earnings Statement (Active and Reserve Forces) in an original only and distributes for:
      7.4.1. Unit Annual Active Duty Training. Bulk mail to paying agent at tour site for delivery to mem-
      ber is no longer available.
      7.4.2. Individual Active Duty or Inactive Duty Training. Mails to the personal mailing address in the
      member’s MMPA for both check payments and direct deposit payments.
      7.4.3. Leave and Earnings Statement Miscellaneous Remark. DJMS-RC Payroll Office actions: Pro-
      cess a TIN D19 to send a message or explain pay processing actions to a member. (See Table 7.3. for
      D19 transaction format).
      7.4.4. Leave and Earnings Statement Remark for CBPO. DJMS-RC Payroll/CBPO office actions:
      Process a D20 to send a message to a certain PAS code or a unit. (See Table 7.4. for D20 transaction
      format).
      7.4.5. Leave and Earnings Statement Remark for Personnel Tempo High Deployment Per Diem. The
      purpose of this LES remark is to keep Commanders and service members informed of their deploy-
      ment days accrued. Beginning October 1, 2000, deployment days will be tracked and monitored by
      the servicing personnel office and forwarded to DFAS-DE for posting to each member’s leave and
      earnings statement. The LES remark will appear as follows: “As of 1 Oct 00, 000 high deployment
      days accrued since 1 Oct 00 (or since entering military service)”. This remark will remain on the LES
      permanently, and be updated monthly as applicable. Those members who enter the service after Octo-
      ber 1, 2000 will have for an “as of” and “since” date, a date equal to their accession effective date (the
      date the member entered the service). Thereafter, the “as of” and “since” date will be updated period-
      ically.

7.5. Mailing Addresses. The mailing address used on the member’s LES is also used on the member’s
W-2 and for any checks which are sent directly to the member’s home address.
      7.5.1. New Addresses.
         7.5.1.1. Each time a member’s address changes and the field inputs an A07 and A08, the Mailer’s
         Choice Software will look at the zip code. Mailer’s Choice changes the five-digit zip code in the
         A08 to a nine-digit zip if it recognizes the zip code provided in the A08 as a valid zip. The plus 4
         is based on the member’s street address.
NOTE: Mailer’s Choice will change the state code to match the zip code.
         7.5.1.2. When Mailer’s Choice adds the plus 4, a management notice is sent to the member’s pay-
         roll office, stating “ZIP CODE/ADDRESS CHANGED PER POST OFFICE. PLEASE ADVISE
         MEMBER OF CHANGE.” The member’s unit should make sure the member has reviewed the
         LES mailing address and confirms that the address is correct. If the address is correct as changed,
         no further action is required.
         7.5.1.3. If the five-digit zip code is not recognized by Mailer’s Choice as valid, the member’s
         address is not changed, the plus 4 is not added to the member’s zip, and a management notice,
         “ZIP CODE/ADDRESS NOT VALID PER POST OFFICE. PLEASE VERIFY AND COR-
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           147


      RECT”, is sent to the member’s payroll office. This notice will be issued every time an A07 and
      A08 is processed with an invalid zip code (according to Mailer’s Choice).
      7.5.1.4. If the management notice in paragraph 3 above is received by the payroll office, the mem-
      ber should be requested to verify their zip code with their post office; then verify the correct zip
      code has been provided to the unit. The unit should verify that the correct zip code was submitted
      on the A07 and A08 transactions. If the correct zip code was not provided, new A07 and A08
      transactions should be submitted to update/correct the member’s address.
      7.5.1.5. If the member gets the above message, yet the post office confirms that the zip code the
      member is using is correct, nothing else needs to be done. The unit will not have to resubmit the
      A07 and A08 if the post office confirms that the zip code provided and/or submitted is correct.
   7.5.2. Quarterly Updates.
      7.5.2.1. Mailer’s Choice will also check the addresses on the MMPA at the end of each calendar
      year quarter to update zip codes. Any time Mailer’s Choice finds a zip code which does not match,
      the management notice, “ZIP CODE/ADDRESS NOT VALID PER POST OFFICE. PLEASE
      VERIFY AND CORRECT” will be sent to the unit. Any time Mailer’s Choice changes the zip
      code, the management notice, “ZIP CODE/ADDRESS CHANGED PER POST OFFICE.
      PLEASE ADVISE MEMBER OF CHANGE”, is issued.
      7.5.2.2. Units should follow the procedures stated above for new addresses for notifying the mem-
      ber of the change and submitting new A07 and A08 transactions, as needed.

7.6. Held Pay for Returned Funds (Checks and EFT Payments).
   7.6.1. Held Pay Transaction (A43). The held pay transaction (A43) is used to place a member’s pay
   account in a held pay status (HPS) due to returned funds (either check or EFT). The A43 transaction
   will be input by DFAS-DE/FJFBA when they receive notification of returned funds for reserve or
   guard members. When this transaction is input it will place the member’s returned funds into a HPS
   and will also generate the following LES remark: “TOTAL NET PAY (AMOUNT) RETURNED.
   ACCOUNT PLACED IN HPS”.
      7.6.1.1. The account will remain in Held Pay Status until an address or EFT change is received. If
      the A43 was for a check return then the RPO/FPO must input one of the following transactions to
      release the held pay: (A07, A08 or A10, (for foreign address) or A18). If an EFT change is
      received, the RPO/FSO must input an A18 (EFT direct deposit start/change/stop) to release the
      held pay. The release of the member from the HPS will cause the following LES remarks to be
      generated “FUNDS RELEASED FROM HELD PAY STATUS” followed by “FUNDS
      RECEIVED FROM (DATE), IN THE AMOUNT OF (AMOUNT)”.
      7.6.1.2. When additional pay transactions are received while the account is in a HPS, those trans-
      actions are processed and the net pay is added to the held pay suspense account while the follow-
      ing LES remark is created: “ENTITLEMENTS PROCESSED BUT NOT PAID, MEMBER
      STILL IN HPS”. All normal accounting records for disbursement and collections are created as if
      the account was not in held pay status.
      7.6.1.3. When additional pay transactions are received on the same pay update as the release of
      held pay, then those funds are paid and released as normal.

      7.6.2. Management Notices. Management notices are produced for each account that is placed into
      held pay status. The management notices are included on the UH022-116 and UH022-164. Manage-
      ment notices will also be produced on the 25th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th and 74th occurrence of held
      pay for one member. If a 75th occurrence is received, then all held pay is released.

                                   INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING

8.1. Entitlements. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 3; AFR-35-41, volume II, and ANGR 50-01 and
177-02 for entitlement to basic and incentive pays. See Chapter 20, “Incentive Pay” of this volume for
payment procedures on incentive pay (AFR-35-41).

8.2. Change in Authorized Number of Paid UTAs or IDTs.
   8.2.1. To change the maximum number of paid Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs)/Inactive Duty
   Training (IDTs) previously authorized in a member’s MMPA, the RC payroll office may process a
   transaction (020) to increase the number of UTAs/IDTs authorized up to a maximum of 60. For ANG
   maximum authorizations, see NGR AF 50-01.
   8.2.2. At the beginning of each FY, the maximum number of authorized paid IDTs will automatically
   convert to the standard number authorized for the member’s pay training category, e.g., Category A =
   48, Category B = 24.
   8.2.3. ANG proficiency training (PTs) and training preparation assemblies (TPPAs) are not included
   in the total number of UTAs authorized (see Table 8.3. for the 020 transaction).

8.3. Additional Flight Training Periods (AFTPs).
   8.3.1. Members assigned to certain organizations and authorized to perform flights, may be paid for
   additional flying training periods (see AFI 36-2115; and ANGR 50-01).
   8.3.2. AFRES Host Operations System Management (HOSM) or Flight Management Office (FMO)
   personnel use AFRES Form 918, Report of Inactive Duty Training Performance – AFTP (USARF) to
   report entitlement to incentive pay whenever member is due base pay for AFTPs. Base pay entitle-
   ments due member for UTA performance are reported via the Unit Training Processing System
   (UTAPS).
   8.3.3. Only 16 AFTPs may be paid in any one quarter.

8.4. Maximum Daily Authorization. Members may be authorized a maximum of two (2) paid UTAs/
IDTs in a calendar day. A member may also elect to perform one (1) paid and one (1) non-paid UTA/IDT
or a number of various other options (does not include active duty) available depending on the person’s
civilian/military status and the training requirements of his/her position.

8.5. Time of Payment.
   8.5.1. Submit data reporting performance of inactive duty for pay as soon as possible after duty is per-
   formed. DFAS-DE processes the data to make payment on the next scheduled update. DFAS-DE
   mails checks and earnings statements to the address shown in member’s MMPA or sends funds to a
   financial organization (FO) via EFTS (Direct Deposit).
   8.5.2. Because of the variety of statuses and the impact each status has on other pay and retirement
   records, it is important for the member and payroll office to accurately reflect the time (a.m. or p.m.)
   and type (UTA/IDT or AFTP, etc.) of training performed. Errors could be embarrassing or costly to
   the member.

      8.5.3. Reporting Training – DJMS-RC Systems Processes. Paid military training translates into a
      code on the MMPA which blocks any further payment for that particular period of time, and those
      points are passed to the Point Credit Accounting and Reporting System (PCARS) to update (block)
      the member’s PCARS calendar. See 1.7.2., “Point Credit Accounting and Reporting System
      (PCARS)”.

8.6. Reporting Inactive Duty Training Periods (IDT) for Pay.
      8.6.1. Inactive Duty Training. Submit a B11 transaction for IDT, unit training assemblies (UTAs),
      appropriate duty (APDY), equivalent training (EQT), or proficiency training (PT). See Table 8.2. for
      the B11 transaction format.
      8.6.2. AFTP. Submit a B10 transaction for additional flying training periods (AFTP) or ground
      AFTPs (GAFTP). See Table 8.1. for the transaction format.
      8.6.3. Incentive Pay for IDT. Submit a B13 transaction to pay incentive pay that was not paid with the
      B10 or B11 transaction.
         8.6.3.1. See Table 8.1. for the B10 transaction format.
         8.6.3.2. See Table 8.2. for the B11 transaction format.
         8.6.3.3. See Table 27.3. for the B13 transaction format.
      8.6.4. Collection of IDT/IP. Submit a B12 transaction to collect days of UTA/AFTPs or incentive pay
      for UTAs or PTs that were paid in error. See Table 32.2. for the transaction format.
      8.6.5. Change for Officer to Enlisted or Vice Versa.
         8.6.5.1. In order to accurately record the accounting data, payroll offices must submit separate
         transactions when a member changes status from airman to officer or vice versa.
         8.6.5.2. Submit one B12/B13 transaction set for the airman status and a second B12/B13 transac-
         tion set for the officer status. See Table 32.2. for the B12 transaction format and Table 27.3. for
         the B13 transaction format.
      8.6.6. Transactions Outside IAS. Unit may now input certain D02 transactions for payment and col-
      lection requirements for dates outside IAS. See Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01,
      D02, and PDS”.

8.7. Unit Training Assembly Processing System (UTAPS). For AFRES Payroll Offices only.
    8.7.1. UTAPS Description.
        8.7.1.1. See the AFRES UTAPS User’s Manual for user information.
        8.7.1.2. UTAPS is an AFRES data collection and management information system designed to
        provide commanders with individual UTA participation information and process military pay and
        participation information transactions. AFRES Reserve payroll offices, Consolidated Base Per-
        sonnel Offices, and all Air Reserve units will use this system exclusively for all UTA processing.
            8.7.1.2.1. AF Form 40 – AFRES and IMAs Only. Use of AF Form 40, Authorization For Indi-
            vidual Inactive Duty Training, will no longer be accomplished except under emergency situa-
            tions, i.e., loss of primary and backup systems, off-site UTAs with no automated sign-in
            capability, etc. However, the unit must enter the information into UTAPS and forward to the
            RC payroll office when the system is again on line or available for use.

                                          ACTIVE DUTY

9.1. Section A – General Procedures and Requirements.
   9.1.1. Entitlements. See the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 2, for entitlement to basic, special, and
   incentive pays, and allowances for active duty. This chapter prescribes the payment procedures for
   basic pay and allowances, including allowable travel time.
      9.1.1.1. Allowable Travel Time. See the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 2, section E, and Table
      1-2-4. RC payroll offices compute allowable travel time for all periods of active duty and include
      authorized travel time in the pay transaction. See Chapter 29, “Leave Policy, Accounting, and
      Payment” for determination requirements when leave is involved.
      9.1.1.2. Travel Allowances.
          9.1.1.2.1. Members: Members are entitled to travel allowance per Joint Federal Travel Regu-
          lations (JFTR), Volume 1. Payment responsibility and procedures are in DFAS-DER 7010-3,
          Travel Transactions at Base Level.
          9.1.1.2.2. Members and Dependents: A member on active duty in a permanent change of sta-
          tion (PCS) status may be entitled to travel of dependents and transportation allowances for
          movement and storage of personal property, including private automobile, house trailer, and
          household goods. For specific entitlements, see the JFTR, Volume 1. For specific payment
          procedures, see DFAS-DER 7010-3 and AFR 75-25, Moving and Storing Personal Property.
   9.1.2. Allowances.
      9.1.2.1. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).
          9.1.2.1.1. Enlisted Members: The RC payroll office reports BAS based on proper authoriza-
          tion. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, AFM 177-373, Volume II; and Chapter 13, “Basic Allow-
          ance for Subsistence (BAS)” of this manual.
          9.1.2.1.2. Officers: Except as indicated in Table 3.1-1 and paragraph 80241b of the DoDFMR,
          Volume 7A, officers on active duty are entitled to receive BAS.
      9.1.2.2. Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ). The member’s BAQ status is established as a per-
      manent part of the MMPA and the amount paid is based upon that status and grade. For example,
      with-dependent BAQ is paid to those coded as having dependents, and partial BAQ is paid to
      those coded as single. Any change to the status posted on the MMPA requires a specific transac-
      tion. See Chapter 14, “Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ)” for additional information.
      9.1.2.3. Other Pay and Allowance Entitlements.
          9.1.2.3.1. Short tours and payments of incentive pays (ACIP, HDIP, etc.) require specific cod-
          ing in the transactions each time the entitlement is payable.
          9.1.2.3.2. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, part 8, for actual guidance on entitlements.
          9.1.2.3.3. See Table 9.3. and Table 9.4., respectively, for the C01 and C02 transaction formats
          for retroactive payment of entitlements. See Table 27.4. and Table 27.5., respectively, for the
166                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             C04 and C05 transaction formats for retroactive payment additional entitlements not included
             on the C01 and C02.
             9.1.2.3.4. Use the “A” transactions, such as the A24, when paying long tour entitlements for
             recording the information on the MMPA.

9.2. Section B – Supporting Documents.
      9.2.1. Orders. Active duty tours must be authorized by orders. (See AFR 10-7, Administrative Orders,
      DFAS-DER 7010-3, and ANGR 10-7).
      9.2.2. AF Form 458, Statement of Tour of Duty. This form, or the machine-generated form equivalent
      (PCN N130070), is used for certification when the active duty order does not contain the required tour
      statement. AF Form 458 must be attached to the actual order (when the active duty order does not con-
      tain the required tour statement) before payment can be made.
         9.2.2.1. Exceptions.
             9.2.2.1.1. Unit active duty (see 9.5., “Section E – Payment of Tours”).
             9.2.2.1.2. IRR musters (see 9.7., “Section G –IRR Muster”).

             “ANG and USAFR Non-Prior Service Members”).
             9.2.2.1.4. Members of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program performing
             their annual 45-day tours of active duty.
      9.2.3. AFRES Payroll Procedures.
         9.2.3.1. AF Form 938. The AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/
         Active Duty Tour is the only form of active duty orders authorized to be used by AFRES units to
         generate military pay. The form contains a “statement of tour of duty” to be completed by the
         reservist/certifying official.
         9.2.3.2. Payroll Submission for Payment. A reservist should send a signed and certified AF Form
         938 to the payroll office within five (5) workdays of completion of the active duty tour. Individual
         Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) send their forms to the nearest AFO or RC payroll office.
         9.2.3.3. Variable Tour Orders (Special/School RPA). For variable tour orders (special/school
         RPA), the following applies:
             9.2.3.3.1. Certified Tour Dates Do Not Agree with Orders.
                 9.2.3.3.1.1. Change Less than 100 Percent or Seven Days: If the certified period of active
                 duty does not agree with the tour dates stated in the active duty orders, but is not exceeded
                 by more than 100 percent or seven (7) days whichever is less, or if the tour is less than the
                 number of days stated in the order, an amendment is not required.
                     9.2.3.3.1.1.1. The certifying official will send the original of the certified AF Form
                     458 to the RC payroll office and to CBPO/DPMT.
                 9.2.3.3.1.2. Change More than 100 Percent or Seven Days. If the certified period of active
                 duty exceeds the number of days in the order by more than 100 percent or seven (7) days,
                 the orders requesting official will require that an amendment be processed.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            167

NOTE: The reporting date of any tour may be adjusted by seven (7) days either before or after tour start
date without an amendment. It must have the approval of the commander or issuing/approving official
and consent of the member, as long as the traveler does not depart before the date the order is authenti-
cated.
   9.2.4. DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher.
       9.2.4.1. One to four sets may be required. Members, upon completion of their tour of duty, submit
       the DD Form 1351-2 to their unit of assignment. The unit follows AFRES or ANG guidance
       (whichever is applicable) on submission of the DD Form 1351-2 to their servicing payroll office.
       9.2.4.2. Members attending seminars must submit a completed DD Form 1351-2 within five (5)
       working days after their return home to the AFO nearest their unit of assignment.

           prescribed in 9.2., “Section B – Supporting Documents”, required for all additional entitle-
           ments for that particular tour of active duty. Instructions for preparation are located on the

           for payment with the AFO designated to pay travel allowances. The member should contact
           his/her travel office for procedures to collect advance travel pay. Members with a DoD Amer-

      9.4.1. Determines Entitlements.
         9.4.1.1. BAS. See enlisted and officer rules as described in Chapter 13, “Basic Allowance for

         9.4.1.3. Other.
             9.4.1.3.1. Some of the incentive pay entitlements change for tours over 30 days. Check the
             DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 80231, before processing transactions.
             9.4.1.3.2. Be aware that additional entitlements may accrue after 30 days, e.g., FSA (reference
             DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 3), or after 20 weeks, e.g., VHA (reference JFTR, Volume I),
             or one (1) year, e.g., medical pay (reference DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 10501).
         9.4.1.4. MMPA Review. Review the member’s DJMS-RC MMPA (see Chapter 2, “Establish/
         Maintain a DJMS-RC Master Military Pay Account”) for accuracy of both personnel and financial
         data. Submit the transactions required to correct or update data on member’s MMPA or to estab-
         lish a complete account.
      9.4.2. Obtain Data from Orders.
         9.4.2.1. Accounting Processing Code (APC). Use the APC on the order to input military pay
         accounting data.
         9.4.2.2. Training Category Code (TCC). Select the correct training category code based on the
         information in the order. (For ANG, also see ANGR 50-01. For AFRES and ANG, see Appendix

         9.4.2.3. Multiple APCs. If the order cites more than one APC, submit a separate set of transac-
         tions for each APC. The C01 for short tours (see 9.5.2., “Short Tour Payments – Less than 30
         Days”) and the A24 for long tours (see 9.5.1., “Payment of the Long Tour – 30 Days or More”).

         9.4.3.1. Payroll Processing. The RC payroll office selects data from the orders to prepare the
         transaction inputs for basic pay and allowances. The RC payroll office prepares and processes
         data, including PAS, for DJMS-RC from the certified order and attaches to the applicable input
         listing.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              169


      9.4.3.2. Pay Computation. The RC payroll office computes the number of days of active duty,
      including allowable travel days (if any), for pay and allowance purposes.
   9.4.4. Adjustments to Tours/Payment of Tours. If the RC payroll office discovers a tour has been ter-
   minated early and the member has received payment based on the original end-date, the overpayment
   between the correct end-date and the original end-date must be recouped. Submit a C03 transaction
   (see Table 32.3. for the C03 transaction). Submit separate C03 transactions when appropriation data
   changes.

9.5. Section E – Payment of Tours.
   9.5.1. Payment of the Long Tour – 30 Days or More.
      9.5.1.1. Pay Computation. The RC payroll office computes the number of days of active duty,
      including allowable travel days (if any), and submits an A24 transaction, plus any additional trans-
      actions for entitlements, for pay. (See Table 9.5. for the A24 format). Once established, all entitle-
      ments will continue to pay bi-monthly for the duration of the tour, unless specifically stopped by
      the payroll office. Pay is based upon a 30-day month, regardless of the actual number of days in
      the month, and leave accrues.
      9.5.1.2. Pay Frequency. Members are paid, bi-monthly, via direct deposit or by check twice a
      month. DFAS-DE mails checks and/or earnings statements to the member’s personal mailing
      address at the mid-month and end-of-month payrolls.
   9.5.2. Short Tour Payments – Less than 30 Days. Except for annual training tours and IRR muster,
   short tours of active duty, including seminars, are paid after the fact. For instructions, see 9.7., “Sec-
   tion G – IRR Muster”. For advanced certified annual training tours, see 9.5.2.2., “Payment to Member
   at the End of the Tour – Advanced Certified” and 9.5.3., “Payment Procedures – Unit Active Duty
   Training”.
      9.5.2.1. Pay to Member After Completion of the Tour. Payments after the tour has been completed
      are generated by using check disposition code “1” on the C01 transaction (see Table 9.3.). These
      transactions cannot be input until the tour-end date is equal to or less than the run date. Additional
      entitlements, other than incentive pay, BAS and BAQ partial, or BAQ with-dependents, will
      require the input of an accompanying C02 transaction (see Table 9.4.).
          9.5.2.1.1. To minimize inconvenience to the member, do separate transactions for any tours
          which fall both inside and outside of IAS. Pay is based upon 1/30 of the monthly rate times the
          number days of active duty for the tour.
          9.5.2.1.2. C01/C02 transactions which fall outside IAS will reject.
          9.5.2.1.3. The RC payroll office may use the D02 to pay tours outside IAS. (See Chapter 43,
          “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”.)
      9.5.2.2. Payment to Member at the End of the Tour – Advanced Certified.
          9.5.2.2.1. Payments to be disbursed at or before the tour is completed, i.e., annual training,
          will use check disposition Code 3 on the C01 transaction (see Table 9.3.). These transactions
          cannot be input prior to the member’s reporting date, but may be input prior to the tour
          end-date. Payments with an ending date past the high-date-paid for that payroll cycle will
          recycle until the appropriate payroll date.
170                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             9.5.2.2.2. If the member fails to complete the tour prior to the transaction processing, a C01
             transaction with an “X” in the “Order Cancel” field will cancel the recycling transaction to
             prevent overpayment.
      9.5.3. Payment Procedures – Unit Active Duty Training. DFAS-HQ has agreed to eliminate checks
      for unit active duty training pre-certified tours in order to centralize the process and be consistent with
      the Direct Deposit Program implementing guidance of July 1992. Procedures for IRR Muster mem-
      bers have not changed and will require a paying agent. (See 9.7.2.1., “Unit Commander”.)
         9.5.3.1. Advance Certification for Payment on Last Day of Tour.
             9.5.3.1.1. Payroll checks will no longer be provided to unit members on the last day of duty by
             the unit commander’s paying agent except as stated in 9.5.2.2., “Payment to Member at the
             End of the Tour – Advanced Certified”, and 9.7.2.1., “Unit Commander”.
             9.5.3.1.2. Members performing annual/special training tours (tour types 1 or 5) will be paid
             via direct deposit to their bank account or, if grandfathered from participation in direct deposit
             or with a current waiver, by check to their home mailing address.
             9.5.3.1.3. Commanders, wishing to inform their members the amount of money available to
             them prior to their return home, may obtain a listing of members, the amount of payment, and
             the disposition of the funds from the RC payroll office.
                 9.5.3.1.3.1. Qualifications for Advance Certification of Payment: To qualify for advance
                 certification of payment, there must be at least ten (10) members performing as one unit
                 and the tour length must be at least 12 days or more. Any exception to this must be autho-
                 rized by HQ AFRES or HQ ANG.
                 9.5.3.1.3.2. Advance Certification – Tour Incomplete: See 9.4.4., “Adjustments to Tours/
                 Payment of Tours” for members who do not complete their tour.
                 9.5.3.1.3.3. Advance Certification – Payroll Processing: The RC payroll office may sub-
                 mit transactions at any time during the tour.
                     9.5.3.1.3.3.1. Payment is generated by DFAS-DE on the payroll run which coincides
                     with the last date of duty.
                     9.5.3.1.3.3.2. If the member has direct deposit, the payment will be sent to the mem-
                     ber’s bank, and the LES will be mailed to the member’s personal mailing address. Oth-
                     erwise, the member’s check and LES is mailed to the home address as shown on the
                     MMPA.

9.6. Section F – Seminars.
      9.6.1. Seminars will be paid the same as regular short and long tours of active duty. Checks will no
      longer be delivered to the seminar site.
      9.6.2. See 9.4., “Section D – RC Payroll Office General Payroll Processing”. For advanced certified
      annual training tours, see 9.5.2.2., “Payment to Member at the End of the Tour – Advanced Certified”
      and 9.5.3., “Payment Procedures – Unit Active Duty Training”.

9.7. Section G – IRR Muster.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             171


  9.7.1. Payroll Office Procedures – IRR Muster. The payroll office performs duties outlined in 9.4.,
  “Section D – RC Payroll Office General Payroll Processing”. In addition, the payroll office ensures:
     9.7.1.1. Start date of tour is equal to or less than coded run date and stop date of tour is equal to or
     less than high date paid. If the stop date is more than the high date paid, the transactions will recy-
     cle until the stop date is equal to or less than the high date paid.

9.10. Pay Status Codes.
   9.10.1. Active Duty Status Codes and Pay Status Codes – an Explanation. The pay status code indi-
   cates what the member’s status within the military environment is at any given time. Each pay status
   code enables or disables the DJMS-RC system with regard to pay and allowances for the member.
      9.10.1.1. Pay Status.
          9.10.1.1.1. The member is usually in a pay status code of “A”. This allows that member to
          perform 48 drills a fiscal year and attend 12-14 days of annual training each fiscal year. Any
          other pay status will have some affect on the member’s authorization to perform drills and be
          paid for those drills or active duty days.
          9.10.1.1.2. The pay status code appears on the MMPA under entitlements data. See Figure
          6.17., in Chapter 6, “DJMS-RC Inquiries MMPA and History Files”.
      9.10.1.2. Active Duty Status
          9.10.1.2.1. The active duty status code appears in the mobilization data of the MMPA (see
          Figure 6.21.) under the ACTIVE-DUTY-CODE field; however, it is entered on the A24 trans-
          action (see Table 9.5.) in the pay status field, card column 16.
174                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             9.10.1.2.2. A pay status code of K, S, or Y will post to the ACTIVE-DUTY-CODE field of the
             MMPA. These codes will not change the PAY-STATUS field of the MMPA. See Table 9.1. for
             the definition of these codes.

9.11. Transactions C01, C02, and A24.
      9.11.1. C01 General Processing Information. The number of C01 transactions exceeding 5 will NO
      LONGER recycle until the next pay update including advance certified tours. Submit advance certi-
      fied tours to ensure payment on the selected pay update.
      9.11.2. C01 Transaction Format. See Table 9.3., “C01, Active Duty Less than 30 Days”.
      9.11.3. C02 General Processing Information.
         9.11.3.1. On infrequent occasions, it may be necessary to submit two C01/C02 transaction sets.
         This may occur if a member is in two different BAQ statuses during the tour and one of them is
         BAQ STAT “2”.
         9.11.3.2. The order number on the second C02 must not be the same as on the first C02. The
         DJMS-RC system checks the last three positions of the order and rejects the transaction if a dupli-
         cate is found. The first position of the order number must always be numeric.
         9.11.3.3. AFRES Order Number Changes. When a second C01/C02 transaction set is necessary,
         change the order number of the second C01/C02 set to ensure DJMS-RC sort criteria are satisfied.
         For example, if the order number is 030, use 30A for the other set. The last position of the order
         number must be changed to an alpha character, otherwise, the transaction will reject.
         9.11.3.4. ANG Order Number Changes. When a second C01/C02 transaction set is necessary,
         change the order number of the second C01/C02 set to ensure DJMS-RC sort criteria are satisfied.
         For example, if the order number is 030, use A30 for the other set. The fourth position of the order
         number must be changed to an alpha character, otherwise, the transaction will reject.
      9.11.4. C02 Transaction Format. See Table 9.4., “C02, Allowance for Active Duty Less than 30
      Days”.
      9.11.5. A24 General Processing Information. See, also, 9.10.1., “Active Duty Status Codes and Pay
      Status Codes – An Explanation” for more information. For HPSP, FAP, STRAP, and ROTC partici-
      pants, see 34.2., Section B, paragraph 34.2.5. for processing of active duty payments.
         9.11.5.1. Pay Status Start Date Rules.
             9.11.5.1.1. If the Pay Status equals “A”, the start date must equal zeros (See note 1 in Table
             9.1.).
             9.11.5.1.2. When the Pay Status is extended before the final payment and the Pay Status
             remains the same, insert the same start date as in the original A24.
             9.11.5.1.3. If original A24 Pay Status start date is older than 250 days before the current run
             date, allow the original A24 to pay out, then submit a new A24 with a Pay Status start date 1
             day greater than the original stop date.
             9.11.5.1.4. When the Pay Status is curtailed, enter the original start date. The start date must
             not 30 days greater than the run date if the Pay Status is M, O, T, U, X, Z.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          175


        9.11.5.1.5. When reporting pay status B, D, E, F, G, H, or I, show the effective date in both the
        Pay Status start and Pay Status stop dates.
     9.11.5.2. Pay Status Stop Date Rules.
        9.11.5.2.1. If the pay status equals “A”, the stop date must equal 999999 (See note 1 in the Pay
        Status Table.)
        9.11.5.2.2. When the Pay Status is extended before the final payment, and the Pay Status
        remains the same, insert a new end-date.
        9.11.5.2.3. If the PAS is S801FB2B and the Pay Status is “O”, then the Pay Status stop date
        must not be greater than 45 days later than the start date.
        9.11.5.2.4. Must not be greater than 360 days from the start date if the Pay Status is M, O, T,
        U, W, X, or Z and A24 is being submitted before the effective date. If the A24 is submitted
        after the effective date, this rule does not apply.
        9.11.5.2.5. To terminate the Pay Status from Pay Status codes M, O, T, U, X, or Z, due to dis-
        charge, separation, or death of member, insert the date of discharge, separation, or death, using
        the same Pay Status code and start date as in the original A24.
        9.11.5.2.6. In the A24, to extend Pay Status codes M, O, T, U, X, or Z, insert the ending date
        if the original tour has not paid out. Otherwise, submit a new A24 with an effective date of the
        day after the original tour end date.
        9.11.5.2.7. When reporting Pay Status B, D, E, F, G, H, or I, show the effective date in both the
        Pay Status start and Pay Status stop dates.
        9.11.5.2.8. When the tour is curtailed, enter the stop date.
        9.11.5.2.9. The stop date must always be equal to or greater than AD-PD-TO-DT (Active
        Duty Paid To Date) on the MMPA. See Chapter 6, “DJMS-RC Inquiries MMPA and History
        Files” and Figure 6.17. on for MMPA information.
        9.11.5.2.10. If the tour was curtailed before AD-PD-TO-DT, use AD-PD-TO-DT as new end
        date. Process a C03 transaction (see Table 32.3.) for overpayment. See Chapter 6,
        “DJMS-RC Inquiries MMPA and History Files” and Figure 6.17. for MMPA information.
        9.11.5.2.11. A24 Transaction Format. See Table 9.5., “Pay Status Change and Active Duty 30
        Days or More”.

                     ANG AND USAFR NON-PRIOR SERVICE MEMBERS

10.1. Section A – Entitlements.
   10.1.1. Pay and Allowances. Non-prior-service (NPS) members of the Air Reserve Forces are entitled
   to the same pay and allowances as other members in the regular forces (DoDFMR, Volume 7A).

       10.1.2.1. Entitlement. Members are entitled to permanent change of station (PCS) travel allow-
       ances for tours of 20 weeks or more. (See Joint Federal Travel Regulations, Volume 1).

       10.1.4.1. Orders. ANG and USAFR issue written orders for initial active duty training consisting
       of basic military training (BMT), technical training (TT), and/or on-the-job training (OJT) (AFI
       37-128 and ANGR 10-7).
       10.1.4.2. Travel Allowances. When the NPS member performs training TDY en route, the orders
       must state: “Member is a pipeline student and is not eligible for per diem payment. Do not charge
       for quarters and meals at TDY station. AFR-30-7.”
       10.1.4.3. BAQ. The marital status of a member is required for the BAQ entitlement determina-
       tion. Therefore, when a NPS member is married to another member, the orders must state: “Mem-
       ber is married to another member on active duty or in the Reserve forces.”
   10.1.5. Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Before BMT.
       10.1.5.1. Entitlements. Certain non-prior-service applicants, who are high school seniors or grad-
       uates, may be enlisted in the ANG or USAFR and may perform inactive duty training before basic
       military training (BMT).
          10.1.5.1.1. BMT within 180 days: High school seniors or graduates assigned to training and
          pay status “L,” who complete high school and enter BMT within 180 days after enlistment,
          may perform a maximum of 24 inactive duty training periods (IDT) from the date of enlist-
          ment to the date of entry in BMT.
              10.1.5.1.1.1. Proficiency training periods and additional flying training periods are not

188                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


                See Table 9.1. for complete list and definitions of pay status codes.
         10.1.5.2. Gains.
            10.1.5.2.1. The RC payroll office inputs transactions (A06, A07, and A08). In the field, UTAs
            Authorized Current Fiscal Year (positions 34-35), for the A06, insert “24” or “36” to establish
            a counter for the IDT periods authorized.
            10.1.5.2.2. See Table 2.6., Table 2.7., and Table 2.8., respectively, for preparing the A06,
            A07, and A08 transactions.
            10.1.5.2.3. The DJMS-RC system updates the member’s MMPA with the non-prior service
            indicator of “6” obtained from the PDS gain entered on an AA1 transaction. The DJMS-RC
            system edits the A06 for the authorized number of IDTs (24 or 36) and looks for the
            non-prior-service indicator. If these two fields do not match, the DJMS-RC system rejects the
            A06 transaction and prints the reject to the JUMPS-RF Action Items – CBPO listing,
            UH022-164.
            10.1.5.2.4. See Chapter 10, “ANG and USAFR Non-Prior Service Members”, and 10.1.5.,
            “Inactive Duty Training (IDT) before BMT.”
            10.1.5.2.5. The RC payroll office corrects the transaction.
         10.1.5.3. IDT Payment.
            10.1.5.3.1. The RC payroll office submits transactions for payment of IDT (B11) before the
            long tour transaction (A24) is input for BMT per Chapter 8, “Inactive Duty Training” and
            Table 8.2. (B11 format).
            10.1.5.3.2. RC payroll office submits transactions (B12), if required, to collect any IDTs over-
            paid before BMT. See Table 32.2. for the B12 format.
         10.1.5.4. Non-Entitlement. Certain non-prior service enlistees are not entitled to perform inactive
         duty training before BMT. These enlistees:
            10.1.5.4.1. Do not meet the requirements of 10.1.5.1. through 10.1.51.3, and
            10.1.5.4.2. Are gained in DJMS-RC with a non-prior service indicator “Y” in the PDS gain
            field of the accession transaction (AA1).
         10.1.5.5. Change of Non-Prior Service Indicator. If the NPS indicator is coded incorrectly (Y, 6 or
         space) the RC payroll office may submit TIN A09 to change the NPS indicator to the appropriate
         code. Please note it may be necessary to also change the maximum number of UTAs allowed
         according to the new NPS indicator.
      10.1.6. Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI) Coverage.
         10.1.6.1. Enlistees are eligible for automatic full-time SGLI coverage from their date of enlist-
         ment. As part of the A06 gain transaction, the payroll office must input the appropriate SGLI
         option to update the MMPA. SGLI deductions are retroactively made for the period from the date
         of enlistment to the time the enlistee actually enters into a pay status (gets paid).
         10.1.6.2. See Table 2.6. for the A06 format. See also Chapter 31, “SGLI and SSLI – Life Insur-
         ance”.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            189


10.2. Section B – Payments.
   10.2.1. Establishment of an MMPA.
      10.2.1.1. CBPO Actions.
          10.2.1.1.1. Upon member’s enlistment, the CBPO inputs PDS gain transactions (A07, and
          A08), (see AFMAN 36-2621 V4 for USAFR and ANGM 30-3 for ANG). The PDS transaction
          must contain the proper Non-Prior Service indicator before the input is processed from PDS to
          DJMS-RC.
          10.2.1.1.2. See Table 2.7. and Table 2.8. for the A07 and A08 formats.
      10.2.1.2. RC Payroll Office Actions.
          10.2.1.2.1. Inputs the gain transaction (A06) per Chapter 2, “Establish/Maintain a DJMS-RC
          Master Military Pay Account”. See Table 2.6. for the A06 format.
          10.2.1.2.2. Reviews the UH022-164 report to determine if the MMPA is incomplete and recy-
          cling. Inputs missing data is the account is recycling.
          10.2.1.2.3. If the RC payroll office does not input the missing data within eight (8) recycles,
          the incomplete MMPA is rejected on the ninth (9) recycle back to the RC payroll office, with
          message: “NO MATCHING COMPLETE MASTER RECORD”.
   10.2.2. Payroll Office Responsible for Payment.
      10.2.2.1. Basic Military Training (BMT). While in BMT, the AFO at Lacklack AFB pays the
      member the same amounts as a member of the regular Air Force. For fund accountability and pro-
      cedures, see 10.3., “Section C – Basic Military Training (BMT) Payment”. See, also, 1.7.3.,
      “Lackland Trainee Initial Pay System (TIPS)”, for an explanation of TIPS.
      10.2.2.2. Technical Training and On-the-Job-Training. Upon completion of BMT, the RC payroll
      office assumes payment responsibility. See 10.4., “Section D – Technical Training and On-the-Job
      Training”, for procedures.

10.3. Section C – Basic Military Training (BMT) Payment.
   10.3.1. Payment Responsibilities and Procedures.
      10.3.1.1. RC Payroll Office.
          10.3.1.1.1. RC payroll office inputs the A24 transaction (see Table 10.1.) for the long tour
          with pay status code “V” when member departs for Lackland AFB and BMT. Any other pay
          status will reject with error message “MEMBER IS NON-PRIOR SERVICE – PAY STATUS
          NOT AUTHORIZED.” See Table 9.1. for pay status codes and definitions.
          10.3.1.1.2. If the long tour transaction is not input prior to the final payment (E01 with a pay-
          ment indicator of “X”), a pay status of “W” will automatically be generated (see paragraph
          10.5 below).
      10.3.1.2. Lackland AFO. AFO, Lackland AFB, makes payments listed below as paid-for-others
      and paid-for-self. (Also, see Chapter 40, “DJMS-RC and DJMS-AC Reconciliation”.)
          10.3.1.2.1. Makes partial payments to members as paid-for-others transactions. Use 3850
          funds for ANG members and 3700 funds for USAFR members.
190                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             10.3.1.2.2. Pays travel allowances from DD Form 1351-2 for member’s travel from home to
             Lackland AFB. For ANG (3850 funds) and USAFR (3700), processes the vouchers as
             paid-for-others per DFAS-DER 7010-1.
             10.3.1.2.3. Pays initial clothing allowance vouchers submitted by the base supply officer per
             AFMAN 23-110CD. For USAFR (3700 funds), processes the vouchers as paid-for-others
             transactions per DFAS-DER 7010-1; for ANG (3850 funds), processes vouchers as
             paid-for-self transactions.
             10.3.1.2.4. Processes vouchers for charges for subsistence-in-kind as paid-for-others transac-
             tions for both USAFR (3700 funds) and ANG (3850 funds).
      10.3.2. Advance and Partial Payments. On the first day of duty, the Lackland AFO pays the NPS
      member a partial payment. Approximately 15 days later, a second partial payment is made. Upon
      graduation, payment is made for net pay due. HQ/ATC establishes the amounts of all payments.
      10.3.3. Payment Processing. For normal processing, the following actions will be taken:
         10.3.3.1. Lackland AFO. Lackland AFO processes their E01 (See Table 10.2. for the E01 trans-
         action format) transaction for each partial payment made, using a payment indicator code of “N”
         for first and second payments; then submits input to DFAS-DE.
             10.3.3.1.1. The E01 transaction (See Table 10.2.) will reject to DFAS-DE/FJPA if DJMS-RC
             does not have a master record for the SSN. This means that the “record was not properly
             gained.” Any future E01 transactions will post the partial payment amount to the accounts
             receivable record (See 32.14., “Partial Payment Reporting – DW” for procedures).
             10.3.3.1.2. If the member’s pay record does not reflect a pay status of “V” or “W”, a “Master
             File for Review” notice will be generated with message “E01 PARTIAL PS NOT V/W.” The
             RC payroll office must submit a long tour A24 transaction (See Table 10.1.) with pay status
             “V” using dates contained in the active duty orders. (See paragraph 10.4.)
             10.3.3.1.3. When the final payment is made to the member, a payment indicator code of “X”
             is generated. The member’s pay status then changes from “V” to “W”, and payment is posted
             to the member’s record as an accounts receivable. On the next code 2 or 3 update, pay is com-
             puted from the pay start date to the current midmonth or end-of-month cycle, as appropriate.
             Partial payments made by Lackland AFO and any other applicable deductions are subtracted
             from gross pay and the balance of funds is sent to member’s personal mailing address or finan-
             cial institution as indicated on the MMPA.
             10.3.3.1.4. If the “V” status was not previously established on the long tour transaction (A24),
             dates in the E01 transaction will automatically establish a pay status of “W”.
                 10.3.3.1.4.1. The start date used in the E01 transaction will be posted as the pay start date
                 and the voucher date will be used as the stop date.
                 10.3.3.1.4.2. The DJMS-RC system will generate two UH022-176 MMPA prints with
                 messages “E01 FINAL PS NOT V/W” and “E01 X/R-MBR-NOW PS W.”
                 10.3.3.1.4.3. The DJMS-RC payroll office must immediately submit an A24 with pay sta-
                 tus “W” for the follow-on training at the technical school or on-the-job training or the
                 member’s pay will stop.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          191


             10.3.3.1.4.4. See Table 10.1. and Table 10.2., respectively, for the A24 and E01 formats.
  10.3.4. Input when Fraudulent Enlistment Involved.
     10.3.4.1. Lackland AFO prepares an E01 transaction with a payment indicator code of “F” and
     submits it to DFAS-DE. See Table 10.2. for the E01 format.
     10.3.4.2. The DJMS-RC system posts any partial payments made to the member’s accounts
     receivable.
     10.3.4.3. A case file is set up and partial payment debts are worked by DFAS-DE/FJPA.
  10.3.5. Input for Early Release.
     10.3.5.1. Lackland AFO prepares an E01 transaction with a payment indicator code of “R” and
     submits it to DFAS-DE.
         10.3.5.1.1. The pay stop date is usually the date of release from duty plus one (1) day for con-
         structive travel time back to home unit.
         10.3.5.1.2. If the constructive travel day falls on a weekend or holiday, then the next normal
         duty day would be the constructive travel day and the intermediate days would be considered
         regular duty days.
         10.3.5.1.3. See Table 10.2. for the E01 format.
     10.3.5.2. The E01 transaction will generate a partial payment debt, convert the MMPA pay status
     code from “V” to “W” and change the pay status stop date to the date computed in paragraph
     above.
         10.3.5.2.1. If the “V” status was not previously established, dates in the E01 transaction will
         be used to establish a pay status code of “W”.
         10.3.5.2.2. The date used in the E01 transaction will generate pay start and stop dates.
         10.3.5.2.3. The DJMS-RC system will generate two UH022-176 MMPA prints with messages
         “E01 FINAL PS NOT V/W” and “E01 X/R-MBR NOW PS W”. No further action is neces-
         sary by the unit.
         10.3.5.2.4. See Table 10.2. for the E01 format. See Table 10.1. for the A24 format.
     10.3.5.3. Pay is computed and any partial payments are deducted. If there is a balance due the
     member, payment is made on the next code 2 or code 3 update.
  10.3.6. Voucher Preparation.
     10.3.6.1. Lackland AFO prepares DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher, with DD Form 115, Mili-
     tary Payroll Money List, or a computerized money list.
         10.3.6.1.1. Prepares separate vouchers for ANG 3850 and USAFR 3700 funds.

                           ACTIVE AND INACTIVE DUTY WITHOUT PAY

11.1. Active Duty Without Pay.
      11.1.1. Entitlement – Active Duty …without Pay. Members performing active duty without pay may
      be entitled to subsistence and quarters per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 80241b and 80242b.
      Members are not entitled to payment of subsistence or quarters allowance for inactive duty training.
      11.1.2. Payment Procedures – Active Duty without Pay.
         11.1.2.1. The RC payroll office prepares a DD Form 114, stating time and dates of entitlement to
         active duty allowances, and sends it to DFAS-DE/FJPA. The RC payroll office requests the CBPO
         or other appropriate office update the Point Credit Accounting and Reporting System (PCARS).
         11.1.2.2. Upon receipt of the DD Form 114, DFAS-DE/FJPA determines if the member’s MMPA
         is on the system.
         11.1.2.3. If it is, DFAS-DE/FJPA prepares the D02 transaction (see Table 43.3.) to make payment
         of appropriate allowances, and includes message information on the D18 transaction (see Table
         43.29.) on the MMPA.
         11.1.2.4. If no MMPA exists, DFAS-DE/FJPA prepares a voucher for payment and forwards to
         DFAS-DE/FJF.

11.2. Inactive Duty Without Pay.
      11.2.1. Entitlement – Inactive Duty without Pay.
         11.2.1.1. Members may perform Inactive Duty without pay, otherwise known as Inactive Duty for
         Points Only.
         11.2.1.2. Members are not entitled to any pay or allowances when performing inactive duty for
         points only.
      11.2.2. Unit Procedures – Reporting Inactive Duty without Pay. Follow guidance as issued by HQ
      AFRES or ANGRC/FMFPM (whichever is applicable).
      11.2.3. Posting Procedures – Inactive Duty without Pay. In order for the “Points Only” performance
      to be posted to the member’s MMPA and the points passed to PCARS, the RC payroll office must
      input a B11 transaction (see Table 8.2.), with a “Y” in the NONPAY IDENTIFIER field (position 44)
      and all blanks in the APC field (position 59-64). For Air Force Reserve Command only: When a
      member performs IDT for points only, the AF 40A is completed and marked “nonpay” under the pay
      status block. Member should forward the completed 40A to their MPF customer service office for
      processing into PCARS.
      11.2.4. Errors in Posting Procedures – Inactive Duty without Pay. If the member’s calendar is posted
      with a “P” in error, the RC payroll office must submit a B12 (see Table 32.2.), with a “3” in the COL-
      LECTION CODE field (position 16) and a “P” in the TYPE DUTY field (position 58).

                                                  BASIC PAY

12.1. General. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 2, for entitlements.

12.2. Rate. The initial rate of basic pay is established based on the member’s grade and years of credit-
able service completed (as defined by the DoDFMR, Volume 7A,) when the member is accessed to the
DJMS-RC pay system. Various events which occur during a member’s service may cause the basic rate to
change or cause payment to stop. These events include:
      12.2.1. Promotion or demotion
      12.2.2. Completion of additional year of creditable service (longevity)
      12.2.3. Non-pay status (AWOL, desertion, excess leave, etc.)
      12.2.4. Basic pay rate changes (annual pay raises authorized by Congress)
      12.2.5. Separation

12.3. Officers – Over 4 Years Active Enlisted And Warrant Officer Service.
      12.3.1. Special Over-4 Pay Rate.
         12.3.1.1. An officer in pay grade O-1E, O-2E, or O-3E is entitled to the special rate of pay for that
         grade if the member has had over four (4) years of active duty service as an enlisted member or
         over four (4) years combined enlisted and warrant officer time.
         12.3.1.2. An officer in this category with exactly four (4) years (or less) is not entitled to the spe-
         cial rate of pay. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 10105.
      12.3.2. Computing the Active Duty Service. The CBPO computes active service, including active
      duty and active duty training, as defined in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, glossary.
      12.3.3. RC Payroll Office Procedures. The responsible CBPO identifies these officers to the payroll
      office. When an officer is erroneously identified or is entitled, but the A06 transaction (see Table 2.6.)
      did not process, an A14 correction transaction is required (see Table 12.1.).
      12.3.4. Special Over-4 Pay.
         12.3.4.1. Special Over-4 Pay Rate – Effective Date Inside IAS
             12.3.4.1.1. When the effective date of grade is within IAS, the computer processes and pays
             the difference in pay automatically. A management notice is generated to the RC payroll office
             indicating that the retro payment was made.
             12.3.4.1.2. A message, “ADJUSTMENT FOR OVER-4 YEARS ENL/WAR OFC SERVICE
             INCLUDED”, is printed on the LES.
         12.3.4.2. Special Over-4 Pay Rate – Effective Date Outside IAS.
             12.3.4.2.1. When the effective date of grade is outside IAS, the computer will process that
             portion of the change which is within IAS, and pay the member the difference in pay.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                       199


        12.3.4.2.2. A management notice is sent to DFAS-PMJPR/DE, requesting manual processing
        of any payment due to the period which was outside IAS.
  12.3.5. Promotions, Demotions, and Pay Date Changes.
     12.3.5.1. Promotions or Demotions.
        12.3.5.1.1. An airman commissioned as an officer is processed as a promotion in DJMS-RC.
        12.3.5.1.2. A change of status from officer to airman is processed as a demotion in DJMS-RC.
        12.3.5.1.3. The RC payroll office does not submit loss transactions to DJMS-RC.
        12.3.5.1.4. See Table 12.2. for the 113 transaction format.
            12.3.5.1.4.1. Promotions – Effective Date within IAS: When the effective date of the pro-
            motion is within IAS, the difference in pay is computer-generated, except for VHA/COLA
            and medical, dental, veterinary, and optometry officers (MDVO) special pay.
               12.3.5.1.4.1.1. The computer creates a management notice for the RC payroll office
               indicating that an adjustment to VHA/COLA or MDVO may be required.
               12.3.5.1.4.1.2. The computer prints a message “INCLUDES RETRO PROMOTION
               AMOUNT” on the LES.
               12.3.5.1.4.1.3. If the reported new grade on the 113 transaction is more than one grade
               higher than the current grade, a management notice is generated to DFAS-PMJPP/DE
               requesting verification of the pay grade. The computer still pays the difference in pay
               to the member.
        12.3.5.1.5. Promotions – Effective Date outside IAS: When the effective date of the promo-
        tion is outside of IAS, the computer automatically updates the member’s current grade and
        makes the effective date of grade (EDG) the processing date (run date) of the 113 transaction.
            12.3.5.1.5.1. The computer generates a management notice to the RC payroll office,
            requesting validation of the EDG and submission of another 113 transaction, with action
            indicator of “05”. This management notice will continue to be generated on every Code 3
            update until the EDG is validated.
            12.3.5.1.5.2. Upon receipt of the 113 transaction, the system processes and pays that por-
            tion of the change which is within IAS. A management notice to DFAS-PMJPR/DE, is
            generated for manual processing of any payments due outside IAS.
     12.3.5.2. Demotions. All manual pay adjustments for demotions are processed by DFAS-PMJPR/
     DE.
        12.3.5.2.1. Demotions – Effective Date within IAS: When the effective date of the demotion
        is within IAS, DJMS-RC will systematically make pay and entitlement adjustments except in
        the following cases:
            12.3.5.2.1.1. General Officer Demotion. When a 113 to demote a general officer is input,
            a management notice is generated to the input source. The management notice says: “Gen-
            eral officer demotion, RPO manual computation of entitlements necessary”.
            12.3.5.2.1.2. Officer to enlisted grade demotion. When a 113 is input to demote an officer
            to an enlisted grade, the system adjusts all pay and entitlements except BAS. A manage-
200                                                            AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            ment notice is generated to the input source. The management notice says: “Officer to
            enlisted demotion, BAS computation to be done by RPO”.
            12.3.5.2.1.3. Positive adjustment as a result of the demotion. In very rare cases, a demo-
            tion may result in a positive adjustment in these cases, a management notice is generated
            stating: “Positive adjustment on demotion, please verify”.
         12.3.5.2.2. Demotions – Effective Date Outside IAS: When the effective date of the demotion
         is outside IAS, the computer will update the member’s current grade and make the effective
         date of grade (EDG) the processing date (run date) of the 113 transaction.
            12.3.5.2.2.1. The computer generates a management notice to the RC payroll office
            requesting validation of the EDG and submission of another 113 transaction with action
            indicator of “05” (EDG validation) and the validated effective date of grade. This manage-
            ment notice will continue to generate on every Code 3 update until the EDG is validated.
            12.3.5.2.2.2. Upon receipt of the RC payroll office 113 transaction for verification, the
            system will generate a management notice to DFAS-PMJPR/DE, for their manual process-
            ing of any payment due outside IAS.
            12.3.5.2.2.3. DFAS-PMJPR/DE inputs the D01 and D02 transactions to collect the differ-
            ence in pay. See Table 43.5. and Table 43.11., respectively, for the D01 and D02 transac-
            tion formats.
      12.3.5.3. Pay Date Changes.
         12.3.5.3.1. The computer creates a management notice to the RC payroll office on
         UH022-164 report and generates an MMPA for the RC payroll office to review (UH022-176).
         12.3.5.3.2. The RC payroll office verifies with CBPO that the new pay date on the MMPA is
         correct for pay recomputation purposes, and submits a 113 transaction, with an action indica-
         tor of “04” (pay date validation), to report the correct date for pay recomputation. See Table
         12.2. for the 113 transaction format.
            12.3.5.3.2.1. Pay Date Changes – Effective Date Inside IAS: When the effective date for
            pay recomputation is within IAS, the difference in pay is computer-generated. A message,
            “INCLUDES PAY DATE CHANGE”, is printed on the LES.
            12.3.5.3.2.2. Pay Date Changes – Effective Date Outside IAS: When the effective date for
            pay recomputation is outside IAS, the computer automatically adjusts the portion within
            IAS. A management notice is generated to DFAS-PMJPR/DE for manual processing of
            that portion of adjustment outside IAS.

204                                                                   AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             13.3.5.1.1. BAS Entitlement: A reservist, who is hospitalized while on active or inactive duty,
             will be authorized BAS beginning when admitted and ending when released. If hospitalization
             occurs at a military hospital, the reservist pays the subsistence charges when released.
             13.3.5.1.2. Member Responsibilities for Reporting Hospitalization.
                 13.3.5.1.2.1. The reservist furnishes a receipt to the RC payroll office. The RC payroll
                 office then processes a C04 (see Table 27.4.) or military pay order to credit the member’s
                 pay account with BAS.
                 13.3.5.1.2.2. When a reservist is authorized BAS, other than BAS type “B”, the payroll
                 office processes a C03 transaction (see Table 32.3.) to collect the incorrect rate of BAS
                 and a C04 (see Table 27.4.) to pay the correct rate of BAS.
                 13.3.5.1.2.3. If the reservist is unable to pay for the subsistence charges, the medical facil-
                 ity sends a DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, to the RC payroll office for col-
                 lection action.
                 13.3.5.1.2.4. The RC payroll office processes the DD Form 139 and the BAS input trans-
                 action, simultaneously, to DFAS-DE/FJP.
         13.3.5.2. Member Hospitalized at Civilian Medical Facility. If the reservist is hospitalized at a
         civilian medical facility, billing will be as follows:

                     BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING (BAH TYPE II)

14.1. Basic Entitlement.
   14.1.1. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 2, section E, for entitlement when performing active duty.
   BAH is not an entitlement of pay when performing IDT.
   14.1.2. When a member is called to active duty for training, the place where the training or duty is
   performed is the permanent duty station for BAH entitlements.
   14.1.3. Effective 2 August 1990, if a member is called to active duty for other than training and no
   permanent change of station (PCS) orders are issued, the permanent duty station is the monthly drill
   station for BAH entitlements.

14.2. Dependency Determinations. AFM 177-373, Volume IV, gives requirements for dependency
determinations. See 14.8., “Entitlement Recertification”.

14.3. Without Dependent Rate BAH Type II. Documents supporting payment of the “Without Depen-
dent Rate” BAH are created and certified IAW the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, using active duty orders or AF
Form 594, as applicable.

14.4. Partial BAH.
   14.4.1. Entitlement. A member without dependents is entitled to partial BAH (BAH rebate) if that
   member is assigned to single-type quarters or is on field duty and is not entitled to receive BAH Type
   II (see AFI 32-6005).
   14.4.2. Payment Procedures – Partial BAH. DJMS-RC automatically pays partial BAH to a member
   without dependents.
      14.4.2.1. If the member is entitled to the BAH Type II in his or her own right but has been paid
      partial BAH, the RC payroll office:
          14.4.2.1.1. First, submits a C03 transaction (see Table 32.3.) for collection of the partial BAH.
          14.4.2.1.2. Then, submits a C04 (see Table 27.4.) to pay BAH in own right on the same pay-
          ing update, and a separate C03 transaction (see Table 32.3.) when appropriation data changes.
   14.4.3. Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAH) Diff.
      14.4.3.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide field instruction on the payment of
      BAH-DIFF to guard and reserve members.
      14.4.3.2. Applicability and Scope.
          14.4.3.2.1. Members of the reserve component, paid by the Defense Joint Military Pay Sys-
          tem – Reserve Component (DJMS-RC), who occupy single type government quarters, and
          who are authorized BAH-DIFF solely by reason of the member’s payment of child support
          shall be paid an amount equal to the difference between the with-dependent and the with-
          out-dependent rates for the member’s grade, otherwise known as BAH-DIFF.

         14.4.3.2.2. Members who are legally divorced or separated with a court order, or written
         agreement between the parties, to provide child support are entitled to BAH-DIFF. However,
         the amount of child support must be equal to or greater than the difference between the with
         and without-dependent rates of BAH Type II. When authorized to reside off base, members
         receiving without-dependent rate BAH Type II and court ordered to pay child support are enti-
         tled to without-dependent rate BAH Type II plus BAH-DIFF.
      14.4.3.3. Policy.
         14.4.3.3.1. Policy for entitlement to BAH-DIFF is contained in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A,
         chapter 26, paragraph 260416.
         14.4.3.3.2. BAH-DIFF and without-dependent rate BAH Type II are payable for the same
         off-base period.
         14.4.3.3.3. Partial Rate BAH is not payable with any other type of BAH Type II.
         14.4.3.3.4. BAH-DIFF is not payable if the dependent children, for whom the member is
         being paid BAH, occupy family type government quarters permanently.
      14.4.3.4. Supporting Documents.
         14.4.3.4.1. AF Form 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change Basic
         Allowance for Housing (BAH Type II), or Dependency Redeterminations.

         14.4.3.5.1. Examines original documents and makes a determination whether or not
         BAH-DIFF is payable. The amount of support must equal or exceed the difference between
         the with- and without-dependent rates of BAH. If the amount of support does not meet or
         exceed the minimum requirement, BAH-DIFF is not payable.
         14.4.3.5.2. Processing for active duty inside immediate access storage (IAS), member is
         receiving without dependent rate BAH Type II.
             14.4.3.5.2.1. If the member is currently receiving without-dependent rate BAH and the
             member is also entitled to BAH-DIFF, the unit payroll office will:

14.6. BAH Entitlement when Husband and Wife are both in Service.
   14.6.1. Husband/Wife – Both on Active Duty – No Other Dependents (Reference DoDFMR, Volume
   7A, Table 3.2-4).
      14.6.1.1. A member married to another member, with no other dependents, and assigned to the
      same or adjacent bases, are each entitled to BAH Type II as a member without dependents when
      family-type quarters are not assigned. They are permitted to reside off-station, regardless of avail-
      ability of single-type quarters for either or both members.
          14.6.1.1.1. When a member married to another member, with no other dependents, are pre-
          vented by distance from living with his/her spouse, both are considered members without
          dependents for assignment of government quarters and entitlement to BAH Type II.
   14.6.2. Husband/Wife – Both on Active Duty – with Dependent Child(ren). When a member is mar-
   ried to another member, and there is a dependent child, both are on active duty:
      14.6.2.1. One member is entitled to BAH Type II as a member with dependents and
      14.6.2.2. The other is entitled to BAH Type II as a member without dependents when family-type
      quarters are not assigned.
      14.6.2.3. The member who would earn the highest “BAH with dependent” rate receives the “BAH
      with dependents” rate.
   14.6.3. Husband/Wife – One on Active Duty. When a member is married to another member, with
   one member on active duty, the member on active duty is entitled to BAH as a member with depen-
   dents when family-type quarters are not assigned.
   14.6.4. Reporting of Status for BAH Purposes.
      14.6.4.1. A member whose spouse is a military member adds these data on the AF Form 594. See
      14.3., “Without Dependent Rate BAH”.
          14.6.4.1.1. Spouse is or is not a full-time active duty member.
          14.6.4.1.2. Spouse is or is not living with member.
      14.6.4.2. The unit of the Reserve or ANG member sends a DD Form 139, to the FSO of the active
      duty member changing the BAH status. See 14.6., “BAH Entitlement When Husband and Wife
      Are Both in Service” for appropriate entitlement.

14.7. RC Payroll Office Procedures.
   14.7.1. Gains. The RC payroll office prepares the following input:
      14.7.1.1. Based on data on the AF Form 594 or DD Form 137, enters dependency status for BAH
      purposes in the gain transaction (position 36, BAH STATUS field, Table 2.6.).
      14.7.1.2. If either AF Form 594 or DD Form 137 is not available, gains member as single, without
      dependents.
   14.7.2. Changes. Based on data on the AF Form 594 or DD Form 137, prepares an A15 transaction
   (see Table 14.4.).
   14.7.3. Determination Pending.
220                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         14.7.3.1. Do not pay BAH until the dependency determination has been made.

                                                 Chapter 16

        OVERSEAS STATION ALLOWANCE – COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE (COLA)

16.1. Entitlement. A member on active duty at a place outside the United States (the 48 contiguous
states and the District of Columbia) may be entitled to station allowances per Joint Federal Travel Regu-
lations (JFTR), Volume I, Chapter 7, paragraph U7150(G), and Chapter 9.

16.2. Payment Responsibility. RC payroll offices compute entitlements based on JFTR, Volume 1,
Chapters 7 and 9, and rates in appendix B.

16.3. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Cola Payment Procedures.
      16.3.1. RC Payroll Office Actions.
         16.3.1.1. Adjustments Inside IAS.
             16.3.1.1.1. RC payroll office inputs a C05 transaction (see Table 27.5.) for all payments of
             OHA/COLA, and assembles and maintains supporting documents for the payment (see Chap-
             ter 4, “Supporting Document Files (SDF)”).
             16.3.1.1.2. C05 transactions may be submitted and paid on the exact date of the code 2
             (mid-month) or code 3 (end-of-month) updates.
             16.3.1.1.3. These C05 transactions must arrive at DFAS-DE by the date of the code 2 or code
             3 run or they will recycle until the next coded update.
         16.3.1.2. Adjustments Outside IAS.
             16.3.1.2.1. If the adjustment start date of the performance is outside of IAS, and a C05 trans-
             action is input to pay OHA/COLA, the C05 transaction rejects back to the input site.
             16.3.1.2.2. Use a D02 for all adjustment transactions outside IAS. See Chapter 43,
             “DFAS-DE Unique Transaction – D01, D02, and PDS” for D02 transaction procedures.

16.4. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) Payment Procedures.
      16.4.1. RC Payroll Office Actions – TLA. The RC payroll office furnishes the member who was to
      ordered to a PCS move at an overseas station an AF Form 1357, Request for Temporary Lodging, (see
      Figure 16.1.), and briefs the member on the general provisions of JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, part C.
         16.4.1.1. Instructs member to report to overseas billeting office prior to contracting for lodging to
         avoid financial problems.
         16.4.1.2. Reviews the member’s supporting document file to prevent authorizing dual allowances.
NOTE: A member is not entitled to both overseas station allowances (OHA and COLA) and TLA for the
same period of time.
         16.4.1.3. Advises member to present the forms to the commander’s designated representative,
         usually base billeting, at the active duty site.
      16.4.2. Commander’s Designee – TLA. The commander’s designee prepares the forms and submits
      them to the base FSO.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          243


   16.4.3. FSO – TLA.
      16.4.3.1. Reviews the completed forms and determines entitlement.
      16.4.3.2. Computes payment if member is entitled.
      16.4.3.3. Prepare SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other than Personal.
      16.4.3.4. Attaches a copy of the order and all documents prepared by the commander’s designee
      to the SF 1034.
      16.4.3.5. Process SF 1034 as “paid-for-other” per DFAS-DER 7010.1-R.

16.5. A32 Transaction And Additional Payment Procedures.
   16.5.1. A32 Additional Payment Procedures.
      16.5.1.1. If any of the previously reported COLA or BAH data is erroneous and the long tour has
      not paid out, submit a new A32 transaction with the correct data for the unpaid portion of the long
      tour.
      16.5.1.2. The A32 will not retroactively pay COLA or BAH for duty that has already been
      reported and paid. Input a C05 transaction (see Table 27.5.).
      16.5.1.3. The A32 will not retroactively correct previously paid COLA or BAH that was errone-
      ous. Input C03 and C05 transactions. (See Table 32.3. and Table 27.5., respectively, for the C03
      and C05 formats.)
      16.5.1.4. The A32 will not retroactively collect previously paid COLA or BAH that was errone-
      ous. Input a C03 transaction (see Table 32.3.).
      16.5.1.5. BAH/COLA daily rate input in A32 transaction will be compared to the current FELS
      Max Rate Table. If rate input exceeds the maximum daily rate, transaction will reject with error
      message E32, “Daily rate exceeds the maximum daily rate”.
      16.5.1.6. Many locations had decreases in the BAH rates for 2006. If you are in a location where
      the BAH rate decreased for CY 2006, and you have member’s entitled to BAH that were on tours
      that crossed over the calendar year, you will need to take the following actions. Screen the mem-
      ber’s record to see what rate is being paid for January 2006. If the CY 2006 rate has gone down
      from the 2005 rates you will need to process an A32 to ensure member receives the higher 2005
      rate. Members are rate protected until they come off of active duty and have at least a day break.
      Normally, on an A32, you put zeros in the amount, for the rate protected member’s you must enter
      the daily rate for 2005

                              FAMILY SEPARATION ALLOWANCE

17.1. Entitlement. Members with dependents are entitled to Family Separation Allowance (FSA) Type I
or II per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 3, when performing active duty over 30 days.
NOTE: If a reserve member is on active duty for 30 consecutive days, without a break, the member may
be entitled to FSA, regardless of type of tours, if they meet the conditions of DoDFMR Vol 7A, Chapter
27.

17.2. Supporting Documents.
   17.2.1. DD Form 1561, Statement to Substantiate Payment of Family Separation Allowance. See Fig-
   ure 17.1.
   17.2.2. DD Form 114, Military Pay Order.

17.3. AFR and ANG – Not Attending Basic Training.
   17.3.1. Procedures – Start-Up of FSA I or II. RC payroll office provides the member with a DD Form
   1561 upon leaving duty station or home when the member will be separated from dependents while
   performing TDY or active duty. The member completes part I of the DD Form 1561 and submits the
   form with a copy of orders to the duty supervisor. When the member has been on station 30 days
   (including proceed time), the active duty supervisor completes part II of the DD Form 1561 and mails
   it to the member’s RC payroll office. The RC payroll office prepares the input supported by the DD
   Form 1561. See 17.3.1.1.2., “FSA-II – RC Payroll Office Actions”.
       17.3.1.1. Procedures – Changes.
           17.3.1.1.1. FSA II – Member Actions: The member and active duty supervisor completes a
           supplemental DD Form 1561 for any change of status. An example of a change in status is
           when dependents come to visit the member or the member’s tour is extended.
           17.3.1.1.2. FSA-II – RC Payroll Office Actions: The RC payroll office uses the information
           on the supplemental DD Form 1561 for FSA-II to create a C03 transaction for collection or a
           C05 transaction for payment of FSA. (See Table 32.3. and Table 27.5., respectively, for the
           C03 and C05 transaction formats.)
           17.3.1.1.3. FSA-I – RC Payroll Office Actions: A military pay order is required.

17.4. Non-Prior Service Members – at Basic Training.
   17.4.1. Non-prior service members who are entitled to FSA-II, complete part I of the DD Form 1561
   before departing for basic training.
   17.4.2. The RC payroll office retains the partially completed DD Form 1561 until the member has
   been on station for 30 days (including proceed time). After 30 days, part II of the DD Form 1561 is
   completed and signed by the designated certifying officer at the active duty station.
NOTE: This certification applies only while the member is at basic training.

                                   STATESIDE ALLOWANCES

18.1. Section A – VHA Payment. VHA is an entitlement payable to members on ordered active duty
tours of 20 weeks or more, who are receiving BAQ (with or without dependents). VHA helps defray hous-
ing costs in designated areas. These areas are established by the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation
Allowance Committee (PDTATAC).
   18.1.1. Entitlement – Normal Operations.
       18.1.1.1. Members receiving partial BAQ (members without dependents on active duty for train-
       ing tours) are not eligible for VHA.
       18.1.1.2. Members authorized movement of household goods (HHG) are paid based upon the rate
       prescribed for the permanent duty station (PDS) location. Members called to active duty (other
       than for training) and not authorized movement of HHG are paid based upon the rate prescribed
       for the location from which they are called (or ordered) to active duty.
       18.1.1.3. Entitlement will begin on the day the member is entitled to BAQ; however, the mem-
       ber’s VHA will be reduced by the number of travel days allowed in the Joint Federal Travel Reg-
       ulation (JFTR), chapter 5, from the place called (or ordered) to active duty to the active duty
       location and return (JFTR, paragraph U5160). Refer to JFTR, chapter 8, paragraph U8008 for
       guidance. NOTE: VHA is not payable for annual training (AT) periods.
   18.1.2. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations are designated by the Secretary of Defense.
   When a contingency has been declared, a member may be paid VHA for less than a 20 week tour. See
   18.1.11., “RC Payroll Office – Contingency” for processing procedures.
   18.1.3. Change in Housing Expenses. The member must be advised that any change in housing
   expenses due to change of residence, rental or mortgage payment, sharing status, etc., affects the VHA
   entitlement and they are required to notify the RC payroll office of these changes.
   18.1.4. Limitations. A member’s VHA entitlement will be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of
   the amount by which the member’s VHA plus BAQ exceeds the member’s monthly housing expense,
   (see 18.2., “Section B – VHA Offset”).
   18.1.5. Active Duty Tours of 20 Weeks or More.
       18.1.5.1. Prior Service Members. The rate of VHA payable for a member of the Reserve forces
       stationed in the CONUS is at the rate prescribed for the location from which the member is
       ordered to active duty.
          18.1.5.1.1. Home of Record: The home of record of a Reserve force member not in a long tour
          status is the location from which ordered to active duty.
              18.1.5.1.1.1. A member ordered to the member’s home unit or secondary location before
              continuing to a duty location is paid at the rate for his or her home of record while at the
              intermediate duty location.
              18.1.5.1.1.2. This rate applies from the date the member is entitled to basic allowance for
              quarters (BAQ) and terminates on the day before the day the member reports at the duty
252                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


                 location prescribed in the active duty orders. VHA will be reduced by the number of travel
                 days allowed under the JFTR, paragraph U5160.
             18.1.5.1.2. Duty Location: Entitlement to VHA at the rate prescribed for the duty location
             begins on the day the member reports to that location.
         18.1.5.2. Non-Prior Service Members. Non-prior service members are entitled to VHA at the rate
         prescribed for the location from which they are ordered to active duty (home of record) beginning
         on the day the member is entitled to BAQ. VHA will be reduced by the number of travel days
         allowed under the JFTR, paragraph U5160.
         18.1.5.3. VHA Rate While At Basic Training. The rate determined in 18.1.5.1.1., “Home of
         Record”, above, also applies while the member is processing at the home unit or other secondary
         location, and while at Lackland AFB attending basic training. Lackland is not considered a perma-
         nent duty location.
         18.1.5.4. The initial rate, as determined in 18.1.5.1.1., “Home of Record”, above, will terminate
         on the day before the day the member arrives at the technical training center or the location where
         additional training is provided.
      18.1.6. Tour – Less than 20 Weeks Extended to Over 20 Weeks.
         18.1.6.1. If a member is ordered to active duty for less than 20 weeks, he or she may become eli-
         gible to draw VHA if the tour is extended for 20 weeks or more from the date the member is
         extended. Time served on the tour before extension cannot be included in the 20 week calculation
         and member cannot be paid VHA for any time before the extension.
         18.1.6.2. Entitlement to VHA begins on the date of extension and is payable for the remainder of
         the tour. VHA is payable at the rate for the location established under 18.1.5., “Active Duty Tours
         of 20 Weeks or More,” and 18.1.1., “Entitlement – Normal Operations”.
      18.1.7. Examples of Tour Extension Entitling a Member to VHA.
         18.1.7.1. A member ordered to active duty on 31 Oct 1991 from Keesler AFB to Keesler AFB for
         an AD tour of 10 weeks (70 days). On November 27, 1991 (during the fourth week), the member
         extends for an additional 21 weeks (147 days). Since the member now has 21 more weeks of AD,
         the member is entitled to VHA at the Keesler rate, payable from 27 November 1991 (the date of
         the extension) through the end of the AD tour.
         18.1.7.2. A member is ordered to active duty on 31 Oct 1991 from Keesler AFB to Keesler AFB
         for an AD of 10 weeks. On 13 December 1991, during the 6th week, the member extends for an
         additional 15 weeks. Member is not entitled to VHA because there are less than 20 weeks left
         from the date of the extension through the end of the tour.
      18.1.8. VHA Rate. The rate of VHA is based on the individual grade. Separate rates will be computed
      for officers with over 4 years’ enlisted service: 01E, 02E, and 03E. The rate is based on a monthly rate.
      18.1.9. Computation of VHA. Use the ZIP code in Table 61 to find the applicable index for VHA in
      Table 59. In Table 59, find the applicable grade and next to it, the applicable percentage of monthly
      BAQ. Use the daily rate.
      18.1.10. RC Payroll Office.

      18.1.10.1. To determine the amount due, use the ZIP code of the duty location or home of record
      as determined in 18.1. above.
      18.1.10.2. If an active duty tour was previously paid, but entitlement to VHA exists, review the
      history to make sure a VHA payment was not previously made, then submit a C05 transaction (see
      Table 27.5.).
      18.1.10.3. If an active duty tour has not yet been paid, but entitlement to VHA exists, then submit
      both the A32 and A24 transactions, and any other entitlement transactions, as necessary. (See
      Table 16.1. and Table 9.5., respectively, for the A32 and A24 formats).
NOTE: The A32 will not pay VHA retroactively. Submit a C05 (see Table 27.5.) for payment for any
prior duty.
      18.1.10.4. See Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”, for process-
      ing transactions for dates of performance outside IAS.
   18.1.11. RC Payroll Office – Contingency. Submit a C05 transaction (Table 27.5.) using a “Y” in the
   contingency field (position 55).

18.2. Section B – VHA Offset.
   18.2.1. Reference. JFTR, Volume 1, chapter 8.
   18.2.2. Adjustments to VHA.
      18.2.2.1. Allowances Exceed Expenses. When the member’s prescribed VHA plus the member’s
      BAQ exceeds the member’s rental or ownership expenses, the VHA payable will be reduced by
      one-half of the difference. However, the amount of the reduction is limited to the prescribed VHA.
      18.2.2.2. Allowances Less than Expenses. If the member’s housing costs are equal to or more than
      the total of the member’s prescribed VHA plus BAQ, the member will be entitled to the full VHA
      without offset.
   18.2.3. Definition of Expenses.
      18.2.3.1. Rental Expenses. Rental expenses are limited to the rent payment, liability, and personal
      property insurance.
      18.2.3.2. Ownership Expenses. Ownership expenses allowable are mortgage payments (including
      principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI)) and are limited to:
          18.2.3.2.1. Mortgages used in connection with the initial purchase of a residence.
          18.2.3.2.2. Mortgages used to refinance an existing mortgage to the extent that the new mort-
          gage payments do not exceed the old mortgage payments.
          18.2.3.2.3. Real estate equity loans (second mortgages) to the extent used for the purpose of
          repairing, renovating, or enlarging a residence. Second mortgages for the purpose of furnish-
          ing or decorating a home or for personal reasons are not allowable.
      18.2.3.3. Standard Utility/Maintenance Expense (SU/ME). A SU/ME is added to the member’s
      rental/ownership expense for computing the VHA offset. The standard utility and maintenance
      rate is kept on JUMPS Table 60 by location and pay grade.
      18.2.3.4. Sharers.
254                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             18.2.3.4.1. A sharer is defined as a member entitled to VHA and residing with one or more
             members of the uniformed services, entitled to VHA and/or other individuals (excluding
             dependents) who contribute toward the payment of rental/ownership expenses.
             18.2.3.4.2. The BAQ plus VHA to which each member is entitled will constitute housing
             income (HI).
             18.2.3.4.3. The total rental or ownership expense for the residence plus the SU/ME at the
             appropriate “with dependent” rate, divided by the number of sharers (some may be civilians),
             will constitute each member sharer’s housing expense (HE).
             18.2.3.4.4. Any excess HI is subject to offset as prescribed in 18.2.2.1., “Allowances Exceed
             Expenses”.
      18.2.4. Member Entitled to One VHA Payment Maintaining Two Residences.
         18.2.4.1. When a member and dependents reside in two separate residences, rental or ownership
         expenses of both residences may be combined for the purpose of computing the specific offset
         VHA rate to which the member is entitled.
         18.2.4.2. Although the rental or ownership expense may be combined for the purpose of comput-
         ing the offset VHA rate, only the standard utility and maintenance expense for the applicable loca-
         tion will be used in the computation of the offset VHA rate.
      18.2.5. Compute VHA.
         18.2.5.1. Compute Housing Expense (HE). Obtain the monthly utility rate from Table 60. If mem-
         ber is a “sharer”, follow instructions in 18.2.3.4., “Sharers”.
         18.2.5.2. Compute Rent and Mortgage Expense. Obtain the member’s rent and/or mortgage
         expense. Divide by the number of sharers for the member’s individual allowable rental and mort-
         gage expense giving total rent and/or mortgage expense.
         18.2.5.3. Compute Total Housing Expense. Add the member’s utility rate (see 18.2.3.3., “Stan-
         dard Utility/Maintenance Expense (SU/ME)”) to the rent and mortgage expense (see 18.2.3.1.,
         “Rental Expenses” and 18.2.3.2., “Ownership Expenses”) giving the member’s total housing
         expense.
         18.2.5.4. Compute Allowable Housing Income.
             18.2.5.4.1. Use BAQ without dependent rate for single VHA, and BAQ with dependent rate
             for VHA with dependents.
             18.2.5.4.2. Obtain the VHA rate by grade from Table 59.
             18.2.5.4.3. Add the BAQ amount to the VHA amount to obtain total allowable housing
             income.
      18.2.6. Compute VHA Offset.
         18.2.6.1. Subtract total housing expense (see 18.2.3.3., “Standard Utility/Maintenance Expense
         (SU/ME)”) from allowable housing income (see 18.2.3.4., “Sharers”).
         18.2.6.2. If the result is negative or 0 (zero), there is no offset.
         18.2.6.3. If the result is positive, divide by 2 (two) to obtain the offset amount.

  18.2.7. Reduce Allowable VHA.
     18.2.7.1. Follow procedures in 18.1.9., “Computation of VHA”, for paying total VHA.
     18.2.7.2. Compute a daily rate of VHA. Enter the daily rate in the A32 transaction. (See Table
     16.1.)
     18.2.7.3. This eliminates the requirement to process the DQ03 and DQ07 transactions to collect
     back the VHA offset.
  18.2.8. Limitation on Reduction of VHA (i.e. VHA Rate Protection). For entitlement, reference the
  JFTR, Volume I, paragraph U8002K.
     18.2.8.1. General. Effective October 1, 1995, the monthly amount of VHA actually paid to a
     member shall not be reduced as a result of a change to the annual VHA table rate (usually in Jan-
     uary of each year) except for members who are in an offset situation. If VHA offset applies, how-
     ever, a member may receive less VHA when the annual VHA table rate change goes into effect.
     18.2.8.2. Loss of Rate Protection. A member loses rate protection for the following reasons:
         18.2.8.2.1. When promoted (see example 3) or demoted.
         18.2.8.2.2. When there is a change in dependency status.
         18.2.8.2.3. When there is a reduction in certified housing costs which may occur because of:
            18.2.8.2.3.1. A change in residence within the military housing authority (MHA) index.
            18.2.8.2.3.2. A reduction in rental expenses for a residence.
            18.2.8.2.3.3. Mortgage refinancing.
            18.2.8.2.3.4. Lower costs on an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM).
            18.2.8.2.3.5. Addition of a sharer(s).
            18.2.8.2.3.6. A reduction in a member’s mortgage payment due to decrease in taxes or
            insurance.
         18.2.8.2.4. A member’s VHA rate protection at the current amount will stop on the date the
         member’s certified lower housing costs go into effect or the date the member’s eligibility to
         receive VHA for a given MHA terminates, whichever is earlier. The new VHA rate becomes
         the member’s new protected VHA rate. NOTE: See JFTR, paragraphs U8001E and F for cer-
         tified housing costs.
     18.2.8.3. Reservist Called to Active Duty. VHA rate protection applies when a reservist, who is
     the spouse of an active duty member, is called to active duty. For example, a member without chil-
     dren is married to a reservist and receives VHA at the with dependent rate. During the reservist’s
     tour of duty, the VHA rate dropped for the member with dependents by $50. This couples’ housing
     costs remain the same or higher. The spouse returns from active duty to reserve status. The active
     duty member’s permanent duty station remains unchanged and certified housing costs did not
     decrease. The active duty member’s VHA rate (the amount payable at the point the reserve spouse
     is called to active duty) is protected. The active duty member is entitled to VHA at the same rate
     upon return of the spouse to reserve status.
256                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      18.2.8.4. Member Assigned to an Unaccompanied Tour Overseas. Member permanently assigned
      to an unaccompanied tour overseas and the dependents continue to maintain a residence in the
      same MHA where the member’s old PDS is located, is entitled to rate protection. If the dependents
      relocate outside the old MHA, rate protection is lost and the new VHA rate will be computed
      based on the new certified housing expenses.
      18.2.8.5. Member Married to Member. When computing the member married to member VHA
      entitlement, use the rent sharer formula, increasing the amount for any change to the maximum
      amount allowable for each member.
         18.2.8.5.1. It is possible for the certified housing costs to rise; however, after the manual com-
         putation, the new rent actually will be lower. This will ensure both are protected by rate pro-
         tection. See example 5.
      18.2.8.6. Computation.
         18.2.8.6.1. A member in an offset situation may receive less VHA when the annual VHA table
         change goes into effect. Offset is computed using the current VHA table, current BAQ rate,
         and the SU/ME amount. If there is a change in the VHA table rate (increase or decrease) from
         the old to the new table, offset is applied to the higher of the two rates, either the actual amount
         of VHA paid in the previous year or the new VHA table rate. See example 1.
         18.2.8.6.2. If certified housing costs increase or stay the same, the amount of VHA paid to a
         member will be the greater of the old amount paid or the new computed VHA amount. If the
         member is subject to offset, the offset amount will apply regardless of a VHA table increase or
         decrease. See examples 2 and 4.
      18.2.8.7. Processing. To ensure VHA is administered correctly, the following procedures will be
      accomplished:
         18.2.8.7.1. Verify entitlement to VHA, i.e., tour length and the completion of the AF Form
         3502.
         18.2.8.7.2. The member must certify housing expenses and dependency status any time there
         is a change. Compute the basic VHA entitlement (using the ZIP code of the member’s PDS),
         apply VHA offset (if necessary), and determine if VHA rate protection applies. A computed
         VHA daily rate amount is input in the VHA transaction.
         18.2.8.7.3. The RPO will process an A32 or C05 transaction (whichever is applicable) using
         the ZIP code of the member’s PDS and the computed VHA daily rate amount.
         18.2.8.7.4. After the transaction has processed on the MMPA, a manual check of the daily rate
         must be accomplished to ensure the member is being paid the correct daily rate amount. An
         incorrectly placed decimal point can result in significant overpayment or underpayment.

              will lose VHA rate protection. Each rent share should be increased to at least the old rent
              share amount reported. Remember, the total amount of rent share cannot exceed the total
              amount of the certified housing cost. (i.e. $650.00 in this case).

18.3. Section A – Continental United States Cost of Living Allowance (CONUS COLA) Payment.
   18.3.1. Entitlement – Normal Operations. CONUS COLA is a taxable entitlement payable to mem-
   bers on ordered active duty tours for 20 weeks or more to or in a high cost area in the CONUS. The
   rate is prescribed for the location from which they are called or ordered to active duty beginning the
   day the member is entitled to BAQ (see Chapter 14, “Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ)”). The
   areas of entitlement are established by the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee
   (PDTATAC).
      18.3.1.1. Members receiving partial BAQ are not eligible for CONUS COLA.
260                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         18.3.1.2. Members called to active duty (other than for training) for 20 weeks or more at one loca-
         tion away from his or her principal place of residence (at the time called or ordered to active duty)
         shall be considered to be assigned to duty at that residence and be paid CONUS COLA at the off-
         set rate for that location, if the member is not authorized household goods movement. Members
         authorized movement of household goods are paid based upon the rate prescribed at the perma-
         nent duty station (PDS) location.
         18.3.1.3. Entitlement will begin on the day the member is entitled to BAQ, however, the CONUS
         COLA will be reduced by the number of travel days allowed from the place called (or ordered) to
         active duty to the active duty location and return. (JFTR, paragraph U5160). Refer to JFTR, chap-
         ter 8, paragraph U8009 for guidance.
      18.3.2. Entitlement – Contingency Operations. Contingency operations are designated by the Secre-
      tary of Defense. Members called or ordered to active duty for contingency purposes are entitled to
      CONUS COLA. (See 18.3.7. for processing procedures).
      18.3.3. Active Duty Tours of 20 Weeks or More. Entitlement rules for CONUS COLA are the same
      as those for VHA.
         18.3.3.1. Prior Service Members. The rate of CONUS COLA payable for a member of the reserve
         forces stationed in the CONUS is at the rate prescribed for the location from which ordered to
         active duty.
             18.3.3.1.1. Home of Record: The home of record of a reserve force member not in a long tour
             status is the location from which ordered to active duty.
             18.3.3.1.2. Duty Location: Entitlement to CONUS COLA at the rate prescribed for the duty
             location begins on the day the member reports to that location.
         18.3.3.2. Non-Prior Service Members. Non-prior service members are entitled to CONUS COLA
         at the rate prescribed for the location from which they are ordered to active duty (home of record)
         beginning on the day the member is entitled to BAQ. CONUS COLA will be reduced by the num-
         ber of travel days allowed by the JFTR, paragraph U5160.
         18.3.3.3. CONUS COLA While at Basic Training. The rate determined in 18.3.3.1.1. “Home of
         Record”, above also applies while the member is processing at the home unit or other secondary
         location, and while at Lackland AFB attending basic training. Lackland is not considered a perma-
         nent duty station (PDS) location.
             18.3.3.3.1. The initial rate as determined in 18.3.3.1.1. above will terminate on the day before
             the day the member arrives at the technical training center or the location where additional
             training is provided.
      18.3.4. Tour – Less than 20 Weeks Extended to Over 20 Weeks. CONUS COLA entitlement and pay-
      ment rules are the same as those for VHA. (Reference paragraph 18.1.6.).
      18.3.5. CONUS COLA Rate. The rate of CONUS COLA is based on the individual grade and longev-
      ity. Separate rates are computed for officers with over 4 years enlisted service (01E, 02E, 03E). The
      rate is based on a monthly rate. (See DJMS-AC Table 160 for CONUS COLA dependency monthly
      rates).
      18.3.6. Computation of CONUS COLA. Use the ZIP code in DJMS-AC Table 161 to find the appli-
      cable index for CONUS COLA in Table 160. In Table 160 find the applicable grade and longevity for
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          261


   the monthly rate of CONUS COLA. To determine the amount due the member multiply the monthly
   amount times the index, divide the result by 30 days (five decimal place). Multiply this result by the
   number of days of entitlement.
   18.3.7. RC Payroll Office Procedures. Compute the amount due the member as described in para-
   graph 18.3.6. above.
   18.3.8. Process a TIN D02 with the applicable component of pay (with or without dependent). See
   Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”, for processing transactions
   within and outside of IAS and for transactions which are paying member for contingency operations.

                                               Chapter 19

      MEDICAL, DENTAL, VETERINARY, AND OPTOMETRY (MDVO) SPECIAL PAY

19.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide procedures for the administration and payment
of medical, dental, veterinary, optometry and other related special pay entitlements.

19.2. Applicability and Scope. This chapter applies to eligible officers of the Air Force Reserves and
the Air National Guard.

19.3. Policy. Policy for the entitlement to special pays is contained in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chap-
ters 5, 6, and 7, respectively. In addition, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAS) and some
non-physician healthcare providers are entitled to special pay when performing active duty per DoDFMR,
Volume 7A, chapter 21.

19.4. Supporting Documentation/Establishment/Change of Medical Special Pay Entitlements. The
military personnel flight (MPF) sends a certified statement of service to the reserve component (RC) pay-
roll office to establish the medical special pay entitlement on the member’s pay record, to include the
medical service pay date (MSPD). The certified statement of service may be a computer product, applica-
ble form or memo. In addition, the RC payroll office should brief its medical and dental personnel that
their respective entitlements will be started or changed upon receipt of the appropriate documentation.
The MPF should assist, when necessary, the payroll office in obtaining documentation from either HQ
AFPC/SG or HQ ARPC/SG. For internal control purposes, the RC payroll office will not accept these sup-
porting documents directly from a member.

19.5. Active Duty for Training, Annual Training, School Training.
   19.5.1. Medical Officers (not including dental, veterinary, optometry or CRNA officers) on active
   duty for training, repeat, training tours for less than one year, are entitled to a medical special pay at
   the monthly rate of $450 per month ($15 per day). Once the entitlement is established on the MMPA
   by the TIN A28 transaction, $15 per day will automatically be paid when either a TIN A24 (long tour)
   or a TIN C01 (short tour) is processed.
       19.5.1.1. Active Duty Tours. Input a TIN A28 to initiate the correct MDVO type code and profes-
       sional codes on the MMPA. This transaction records the proper codes and dates applicable to the
       entitlement on the MMPA. Each time a TIN A24 processes, medical special pay will be paid auto-
       matically through DJMS-RC.
           19.5.1.1.1. Input the correct MDVO type code, ‘B or E’, whichever is applicable, in character
           position 16 of the TIN A28. Reference Table 19.1. for a description of MDVO type codes.
           19.5.1.1.2. Input the MDVO professional code, ‘24’, medical pay, in character positions
           23-24. Reference Table 19.2.
           19.5.1.1.3. If an active duty training tour transaction processes before the TIN A28 is input,
           input the TIN A28 using the current date as the start date. For the period prior to the TIN A28
           start date, pay medical special pay using a TIN D02, regardless of inside or outside IAS. Ref-
           erence Chapter 43 for the TIN D02 transaction formats.
264                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


NOTE: A member entitled to medical special pay in paragraph 19.5.1. above is entitled to the medical
special pay listed in paragraph 19.6. and vice versa. A member cannot receive both types of medical pay
for the same period of time. Input another TIN A28, zero-filling the appropriate fields to remove current
MMPA information. This will prevent further payments of medical special pay for active duty tours.
             19.5.1.1.4. If paying medical special pay outside IAS, input a TIN D02 as follows: The com-
             ponent of pay code is ‘B3’ for medical officers. The rate payable is in the DoDFMR, Volume
             7A, paragraph 050102. The dates must not cross calendar months.
         19.5.1.2. Collection of Active Duty Tours.
             19.5.1.2.1. Medical special pay is collected with a TIN C03 (reference Table 32.3.) if entitle-
             ment ID equals ‘01’, ‘Collect All’. If only medical special pay is collected, use a TIN D02
             transaction, regardless of inside or outside IAS.
             19.5.1.2.2. If only medical special pay is being collected, use a TIN D02 ‘C’ transaction,
             regardless of inside or outside IAS.
             19.5.1.2.3. The component of pay code medical special pay of $450 per month is ‘B3’.
      19.5.2. Dental officers on active duty, including active duty in the form of annual training, active duty
      for training, and active duty for special work, for less than one year, are entitled to a dental special pay
      at the monthly rate of $350 per month ($11,6667) per day). The amount will be prorated for periods of
      less than a month. Dental pay is paid using a TIN D02 for either inside or outside IAs.
         19.5.2.1. The amount field must not exceed $350 per month.
         19.5.2.2. The component of pay code is ‘B5’ for dental pay.
         19.5.2.3. The dates must not cross calendar months and amounts are prorated for less than one
         month.
         19.5.2.4. The TIN D02 automatically generates a D04. (See Table 43.11. for the D02 transaction
         format and Table 43.14. for the D04 format)
      19.5.3. Veterinarians or Optometrists are not entitled to their respective special pay entitlements when
      called to active duty for training, annual training, etc. Reference paragraph 19.7. for payment process-
      ing for full-time active duty.

19.6. Active Duty (Other than for Training). Officers on active duty (other than active duty for train-
ing, including annual training) for more than 30 consecutive days but less than one year or more or whose
orders are amended to require continuous active duty for 1 year are entitled to “full” medical/dental pay
entitlements addressed in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraphs 0501 through 0504 or paragraph
0601-0603. “Full” medical and dental pay entitlements are paid on a TIN D02, for active duty either
inside or outside IAS. The types of “full” pay entitlements are as follows:
      19.6.1. Variable Special Pay (VSP). VSP is payable to physicians and dentists based on training status
      (non-intern) and years of creditable medical service. Processing specifics are as follows:
         19.6.1.1. The TIN D02 component of pay codes are:
             19.6.1.1.1. BT – Medical Officers
             19.6.1.1.2. DK – Dental Officers

             mitted on the first scheduled computer update following the month the member failed to meet
             the requirements. (See Table 32.2. and Table 32.3., respectively, for the B12 and C03 for-
             mats.)

     20.1.5.1. Incentive Pay for Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Periods. The RC payroll office inputs a
     B11 transaction (see Table 8.2.) based on the selection of exception or after-meeting-requirements
     reporting.
     20.1.5.2. Incentive Pay for Additional Flying Training Periods (AFTPs). AFTPs may not be
     reported unless requirements in ANGR 50-1 for ANG and AFI 36-2115 for USAFR are met. Input
     a B10 transaction (see Table 8.1.).
     20.1.5.3. Incentive Pay for Active Duty – Entitlement Explanation.
        20.1.5.3.1. A C01 or A24 transaction must contain the appropriate code when requirements
        are met, except for members entitled to continuous ACIP who are considered to have met
        flight requirements. (See Table 9.3. or Table 9.5., respectively, for the C01 and A24 formats.)
        20.1.5.3.2. When requirements have not been met, enter code “N” (no entitlement). See Table
        20.1. for incentive pay code definitions.
     20.1.5.4. Officers with 25 Years’ Commissioned Service.
        20.1.5.4.1. Effective 1 October 1981, officers, grade 07 and above, who reach 25 years’ com-
        missioned service, are not entitled to ACIP. HDIP will pay automatically if the OSD and ASD
        are present on the pay record. The DJMS-RC system stops all payments for ACIP.
        20.1.5.4.2. Officers, 06 and below, who reach 25 years’ commissioned service, are entitled to
        flight pay, if they perform operational flights.
        20.1.5.4.3. The DJMS-RC system retains Incentive Pay type “A”, the OSD, and the ASD in
        the MMPA. See Table 20.1. for incentive pay code definitions.
            20.1.5.4.3.1. RC Payroll Office Actions. RC payroll office prepares transactions as fol-
            lows: (see Table 20.1. for available incentive pay codes.)

                58) to pay HDIP (see Table 8.2. for the B11 format).
  20.1.6. Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Pay.
     20.1.6.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide procedures for paying AWACS incen-
     tive pay to officers, enlisted members and warrant officers.
     20.1.6.2. Applicability and Scope. Members of the reserve component under competent authority
     (orders) to participate in frequent and regular aerial flight as an air weapons controller crew mem-
     ber aboard AWACS aircraft are entitled to incentive pay at a specific monthly rate.
     20.1.6.3. Policy. Policy for entitlement to AWACS pay is in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, part two, for
     active duty, and part eight for inactive duty. A member of the reserve component on active duty is
     entitled to incentive pay under the same conditions as a member on extended active duty.
     20.1.6.4. Supporting Documents.

         DFAS-DEM 7073-2, Chapter 3, Table 3.1.
             20.1.6.6.1.1. Establishes the AWACS experience date.
             20.1.6.6.1.2. Prepares DD Form 114 or completes the MPO section of AF Form 1887,
             authorizing payment of AWACS incentive pay, and sends the documents to the RPO for
             processing. NOTE: All DD Forms 114 and AF Forms 1887 must contain a termination
             date for all non-crew members.
             20.1.6.6.1.3. Reviews PCN: UH022-0160, JUMPS-RF input and batch totals, verifying
             payment of AWACS in DJMS-RC.
         20.1.6.6.2. Military Personnel Flight (MPF). Updates the personnel data file (PDF) with infor-
         mation pertaining to a member’s AWACS duty.

             20.1.6.6.3.1. Receives AF Form 1887 or DD Form 114 from FMO. Ensures the form is
             complete, certified, and signed.
             20.1.6.6.3.2. Verify the member is entitled to AWACS. For example, an officer cannot
             receive aviation career incentive pay (ACIP) and AWACS for the same period of time, i.e.,
             if the member is entitled to ACIP, AWACS is not payable.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                         275


             20.1.6.6.3.3. Determine rate of entitlement using the flight crew status codes. These codes
             also identify, for future reference, the dates needed to increase, decrease, or discontinue
             AWACS entitlement.


Flight Crew Status                               Member


Code 1                                           Enlisted Crew Member
Code 2                                           Non-Crew Member
Code 4                                           AWACS Air Weapons Controller

NOTE: Flight pay must be stopped upon PCS for code 2.
             20.1.6.6.3.4. An example of determining years of experience are as follows:
                 20.1.6.6.3.4.1. An E6 with an AWACS experience date of 850701 has 11 years experi-
                 ence but is classified as “over 10 years” for AWACS pay. Consider the following:


96-07-01                                         Current Date
85-07-01                                         AWACS Experience Date
11-00-00                                         Years AWACS Experience

             20.1.6.6.3.5. Validate the incentive pay code on the member’s MMPA. It should be “N”
             for AWACS. If another type of incentive pay was paid for the same period, verify with the
             DoDFMR, Volume 7A, that AWACS can be paid in conjunction with the additional incen-
             tive pay.
             20.1.6.6.3.6. Payment for active and inactive duty inside or outside immediate access stor-
             age (IAS).
                 20.1.6.6.3.6.1. Input a D02 transaction (reference Table 43.11.). A D02 for active duty
                 AWACS will convert to a positive D06 transaction. A D02 transaction for inactive duty
                 will convert to a positive D13 transaction. A positive “D” transaction indicates a pay-
                 ment of an entitlement.
                     20.1.6.6.3.6.1.1. Use the exact dates of the entitlement, start date through stop
                     date, which correspond to the dollar amount. This will ensure a proper audit trail,
                     allowing verification of the amount paid to the corresponding number of days.
                     20.1.6.6.3.6.1.2. Divide the monthly AWACS rate by 30 (days) to arrive at a daily
                     rate, rounding to four decimal places. Multiply the daily rate by the number of
                     day’s entitlement, rounding to two decimal places. Enter the resulting amount in
                     the amount field of the D02 transaction.
                     20.1.6.6.3.6.1.3. Input separate D02 transactions for each month of entitlement.
                     Do not combine more than one month’s entitlement into one dollar amount.
                     20.1.6.6.3.6.1.4. Component of pay (COP) codes.

             20.1.6.6.3.6.1.5. Accounting processing code (APC). Review the AF Form 938 to
             determine the APC code representing the accounting classification for the mem-
             ber’s tour.
                 20.1.6.6.3.6.1.5.1. The APC for a reserve funded tour is the pay and allowance
                 APC.
                 20.1.6.6.3.6.1.5.2. The basic pay APC for a guard officer on an annual tour at
                 Buckley ANGB is B6A1AA. The “other pay and allowance” APC for AWACS
                 entitlement (same tour) would be B6A2AA.
                 20.1.6.6.3.6.1.5.3. Contact DFAS-DE/FJRC, commercial (303) 676-6143 or
                 DSN 926-6143, for the specific military personnel appropriation (MPA) (basic
                 symbol 3500 fund tours) APC for AWACS duty.
                 20.1.6.6.3.6.1.5.4. If there is any doubt as to which APC to use, contact your
                 support center.
         20.1.6.6.3.6.2. Input a D18 transaction (memorandum entry) for this entitlement.
         20.1.6.6.3.6.3. FMO notification. The RPO forwards a copy of PCN: UH022-0160,
         JUMPS-RF input and batch totals, to the FMO for verification of AWACS entitlement.
      20.1.6.6.3.7. Collection of active and inactive duty inside or outside IAS.
         20.1.6.6.3.7.1. Document preparation. If the member was erroneously paid AWACS
         pay, either the FMO or RPO will prepare a DD Form 139 or DD Form 114 to report the
         period of overpayment. If the document originated in the FMO, it is sent to the RPO for
         processing. The source document must cite the member’s name, SSN, period of over-
         payment, APC, COP, and amount of overpayment.
         20.1.6.6.3.7.2. Input a D02 to collect the AWACS overpayment. A D02 to collect
         active duty AWACS converts to a negative D06 transaction. A D02 to collect inactive
         duty AWACS converts to a negative D13 transaction. A negative “D” transaction indi-
         cates a collection of an entitlement. TINs C03 and B12 will not programmatically col-
         lect AWACS incentive pay.
         20.1.6.6.3.7.3. Component of Pay codes:
             20.1.6.6.3.7.3.1. Active Duty = IM
             20.1.6.6.3.7.3.2. Inactive Duty = IT
         20.1.6.6.3.7.4. Use the same APC code that was used in the D02 (payment) transac-
         tion.
         20.1.6.6.3.7.5. Tax Refunds. Upon written request from the member, the RPO will
         send a message or DD Form 114 to DFAS-DE/FJPR requesting an adjustment to FITW
         tax withholding.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            277


20.2. Section B – Incentive Pay And Dual Incentive Pay Processing.
   20.2.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide general information for paying incentive
   pay or dual incentive pay entitlements to guard and reserve members.
   20.2.2. Policy. Policy for paying incentive pay is contained in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 24.
   20.2.3. Applicability and Scope. Officers and enlisted members performing active or inactive duty
   may be entitled to incentive pay or dual incentive pay if they meet the criteria established in DoD-
   FMR, Volume 7A.
   20.2.4. Supporting Documents.
      20.2.4.1. For parachute duty (including HALO), include aeronautical orders and an unnumbered
      MPA from the flight management office manager certifying the member’s performance.
      20.2.4.2. For other incentive pay types, a letter and unnumbered MPO certifying the performance
      from the unit commander who assigns the member to perform demolition duty.
   20.2.5. Payroll Office Actions.
      20.2.5.1. For one incentive pay (IP) type (excluding HALO), the RC payroll office prepares a TIN
      A19 transaction (reference Table 20.1.) to start or stop parachute or demolition duty. This infor-
      mation resides on the MMPA and allows payment of incentive pay each time duty is paid.
          20.2.5.1.1. TIN A19 Start Date Validation. Enter the IP start date as stated in the aeronautical
          orders or MPO, whichever is applicable, in YYMMDD format. Enter all zeros if the IP type in
          character position 16 is ‘N’. Enter all zeroes if the IP type in CP 16 is ‘A’ and the member is a
          rated officer entitled to ACIP.
          20.2.5.1.2. TIN A19 Stop Date Validation. Enter the IP stop date, as stated in the aeronautical
          orders or MPO, in YYMMDD format. Enter all zeroes if the IP type in CP 16 is ‘N’. Enter all
          zeroes if the IP type in CP 16 is ‘A’ and the member is a rated officer entitled to ACIP. Enter
          all 9’s if the IP type in CP 16 is ‘A’ and the member is a crew member flight nurse. Enter
          991231 if the IP type in CP 16 is ‘A’ and the member is an enlisted crew member and the end
          date in the orders is indefinite. For all members removed from hazardous duty, submit a TIN
          A19 with the same IP type and the same start date as currently recorded on the MMPA and the
          new stop date in the IP stop field (CP 23-28).
          20.2.5.1.3. Duty transactions such as the TINS B10, B11, C01 and A24 contain the incentive
          pay type code to pay when the tour pays.
      20.2.5.2. Inactive Duty Inside IA’s. Ensure either a TIN B10 (AFTP, Table 8.1.) or a TIN B11
      (UTA, Table 8.3.) has been processed for the day(s) the member is due incentive pay. If a member
      fails to meet the incentive pay requirement at the time the B10 or B11 is processed, and later meets
      the requirements (Table 27.3.), input a TIN B13 (Table 27.3.) to pay the incentive pay. Do not
      submit a TIN B13 unless basic pay has been paid.
      20.2.5.3. Active duty inside IA’s. Ensure either a TIN C01 (active duty short tour, Table 9.3.) or a
      TIN A24 (active duty long tour, Table 9.5.) has been processed for the day(s) the member is due
      incentive pay. If a member fails to meet the incentive pay requirement at the time the C01 or A24
      is processed, and later meets the requirements (Table 27.3.), input a TIN C04 to pay the incentive
      pay. Do not submit a TIN C04 unless basic pay has been paid.
278                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


       20.2.5.4. Inactive Duty Outside IA’s. Ensure the member performed duty on the days for the
       incentive pay entitlement and was not paid incentive pay from date of performance to current date.
       For example, a member not paid incentive pay concurrently with the tour does not mean that it
       was not paid at a later date. Check all microfiche/history from date of entitlement through current
       date. Input a TIN D01, Table 43.4. and Table 43.5., for the applicable IP type.
       20.2.5.5. Active duty outside IA’s. Ensure the member performed duty on the days for the incen-
       tive pay entitlement and was not paid incentive pay from date of performance to current date. For
       example, a member not paid incentive pay concurrently wit the tour does not mean that it was not
       paid at a later date. Check all microfiche/history from date of entitlement through current date.
       Input a TIN D02, Table 43.3. and Table 43.11., for the applicable IP type.
       20.2.5.6. Multiple payments of hazardous duty incentive pay.
           20.2.5.6.1. DJMS-RC will accept a second incentive pay type (excluding HALO) for mem-
           bers who are dually qualified to receive two types of incentive pay. The MMPA is not updated
           with the second entitlement. Dual incentive payments are generated from the B11, B13, and
           C04 transactions. The IP type amount must be the same for dual incentive pay entitlement.
           20.2.5.6.2. Incentive pay types that may be paid in combination with other types are as fol-
           lows:
               20.2.5.6.2.1. Parachute Duty (excluding HALO, see note)
               20.2.5.6.2.2. Flight Deck Duty
               20.2.5.6.2.3. Demolition Duty
               20.2.5.6.2.4. Experimental Stress – Acceleration/Deceleration, Thermal, High/Low Pres-
               sure Chamber
               20.2.5.6.2.5. Toxic Fuels or Propellants
               20.2.5.6.2.6. Toxic Pesticides
               20.2.5.6.2.7. Dangerous Viruses (or Bacteria) Duty
               20.2.5.6.2.8. Chemical Munitions
NOTE: Because HALO parachute duty (COP IJ) is paid at a different rate of pay, it is not included in the
dual incentive pay payment process stated above. For active or inactive duty inside or outside IA’s, use a
TIN D02, compute the entitlement manually, use ** as the COP.
           20.2.5.6.3. Inactive Duty. For inactive duty inside IA’s, use incentive pay ‘E’ in CP 58 of the
           TINS B11 and B13. For inactive duty outside IA’s, input a TIN D01, action indicator A, C, or
           G, with the component of pay code ‘IZ’ in CP 34-35. When a TIN D06 is generated, the COP
           generated for the transaction will be ‘IZ’. For collections of inactive duty dual IP, the TIN B12
           will accept COP ‘IZ’.
           20.2.5.6.4. Active Duty. For active duty inside IA’s, use incentive pay type ‘E’ in CP 47 of the
           TIN C04.
               20.2.5.6.4.1. Example 1: If a member is entitled to both parachute duty and demolition
               duty for the same period of active duty, then this would be an appropriate time to process
               several IP entitlements at once. Input a TIN A19 to update the MMPA with the first IP enti-
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          279


              tlement, parachute duty. After the tour has paid, input a TIN C04 with IP type ‘E’ in CP 47
              to pay the demolition pay.
              20.2.5.6.4.2. Example 2: A member is entitled to HALO and flight deck duty. The unit
              processes a TIN A19 to update the MMPA with the first IP entitlement, HALO. Because
              the second entitlement is not the same monthly rate, a D02 is input to pay the second enti-
              tlement.
      20.2.5.7. HALO.
          20.2.5.7.1. Inactive duty HALO is paid using a TIN D01, component of pay code ‘IJ’. Refer-
          ence Table 43.4. and Table 43.5., for the transaction format.
          20.2.5.7.2. Active duty HALO is paid using a TIN D02, component of pay code ‘IJ’. Refer-
          ence Table 43.3. and Table 43.11. for the transaction format.

                                                 Chapter 21

                                    SPECIAL PAY – FDP, HFP, FLPP

21.1. Foreign Duty Pay (FDP) – Enlisted Members.
      21.1.1. Entitlement – FDP. Enlisted members performing active duty are entitled to foreign duty pay
      per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 17.
      21.1.2. Supporting Documents – FDP.
         21.1.2.1. AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour.
         21.1.2.2. DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel.
         21.1.2.3. ANG computer-generated active duty order.
      21.1.3. Payment Procedures – FDP. The RC payroll office verifies that the duty location contained on
      the travel order (AF Form 938 or DD Form 1610) designated as a foreign duty pay area listed in DoD-
      FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 17, and the member meets the conditions listed in Table 1-17-1 of the
      DoDFMR, Volume 7A. RC payroll office inputs an A34 transaction to start entitlement for tours of 30
      days or more. See Table 21.1. for the A34 format.
         21.1.3.1. Submits a C02 transaction, with C01 transaction, to pay FDP for tours less than 30 days.
         See Table 9.3. and Table 9.4., respectively, for the C01 and C02 formats.
         21.1.3.2. Submit a C05 transaction to pay FDP after the original tour dates have been paid. See
         Table 27.5. for the C05 record format.

21.2. Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger Pay – HF/IDP.
      21.2.1. Entitlement. Members performing active duty in an area designated in the DoDFMR, Volume
      7A, chapter 10, who meet the conditions of entitlement outlined in that chapter, are entitled to HFP or
      IDP. Members in a non-designated area who are involved in a hostile fire incident can receive HFP.
      Unit or air commanders must authorize entitlement to HFP based on knowledge of a specific incident
      in a non-designated area, or knowledge of a member’s duty in a designated area. Refer to Figure 10.1
      for designated IDP areas with start/stop dates. Care should be taken when using Figure 10.1 to ensure
      that the area being reported on the member’s claim is in fact valid with reference to both the country,
      dates and whether land, air, or water is applicable.
      21.2.2. Supporting Documents.
         21.2.2.1. HFP should be reported on an AF Form 1881, Hostile Fire Pay Certification and Mili-
         tary Pay Order, for those members entitled to HFP. Do not include or attach classified or sensitive
         information to the substantiating or supporting document. Specific instructions for paying HFP for
         classified locations are to be requested from the appropriate headquarters. When AF Form 1881 is
         not available, DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for
         Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour, DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY
         Travel of DoD Personnel, or ANG Computer Generated Active Duty Order may be substituted if
         it includes all pertinent information contained on an AF Form 1881 including:

      21.2.2.2. DP can be reported on an AF Form 1881, or published orders that reference a duty loca-
      tion in a designated area and DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-Voucher. However, pub-
      lished orders that do not include an itinerary, or state a designated area, are not adequate.
      21.2.2.3. For contingency operations or major deployments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will issue
      processing procedures for staring IDP and other entitlements.
   21.2.3. Payment Procedures.
      21.2.3.1. RC payroll offices will input either an A35 transaction (see Table 21.2.) to start the enti-
      tlement when the active duty tour is reported on an A24 (that has not been paid out), or a C02
      transaction (see Table 9.4.) to pay HFP for tours less than 30 days. The C02 must be accompanied
      by a C01 transaction. A C05 transaction (see Table 27.5.) is input to pay HFP after the original
      tour dates have paid out.
      21.2.3.2. DFAS-DEM 7073-1, attachment 16, contains a complete list of country codes. DoD-
      FMR, Vol 7A, Figure 10.1, contains start and stop dates for areas designated as IDP areas. DJMS
      Table 054, Hostile Fire Countries, and Table 155, Countries of the World, are also available for
      use.

21.3. Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP) – Officer and Enlisted Members.
   21.3.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide general information for paying FLPP to
   guard and reserve members.
   21.3.2. Policy. Policy for FLPP is contained in the DODFMR, Volume 7A, Chapters 19 and 57, and
   AFI 36-2605.
   21.3.3. Applicability and Scope. Officer and enlisted members performing active or inactive duty
   may be entitled to FLPP if they meet the criteria established in the DODFMR, Volume 7A.
   21.3.4. Supporting Documents – FLPP. Proficiency ratings are validated by the:
      21.3.4.1. RC Payroll Office. The RC payroll office verifies proficiency ratings contained in:
          21.3.4.1.1. PB Series Orders
          21.3.4.1.2. Computerized Orders
          21.3.4.1.3. AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action.

             21.3.4.1.4. Commander-Certified Computerized Listing
             21.3.4.1.5. Report of Individual Personnel (RIP)
         21.3.4.2. Personnel Office. ANGRC and USAFR MPFS are responsible for the administration of
         FLPP for their respective units.
         21.3.4.3. IMAS must be tested by either their assigned or attached active duty MPF, whichever is
         more convenient to the member and cost effective to the Air Force. The MPF forwards supporting
         documents to each member’s applicable payroll office for further processing for payment.
         21.3.4.4. Qualification and Payment Procedures – FLPP. Qualification and payment of FLPP
         takes place according to cycles. The effective date of initial certification is the date the commander
         endorses the member’s request to MPF for scheduled testing. FL** the certification date regard-
         less of the date actually scheduled for testing. Once certified for FLPP, annual recertification must
         take place during the same 6-month cycle (A or B) to ensure uninterrupted pay.
             21.3.4.4.1. Qualification. The MPF sends a copy of the document used to start, stop, or change
             FLPP to the member’s servicing payroll office for payment. Information is submitted within
             15 days of the end of each testing cycle.
                 21.3.4.4.1.1. For those who are certified by the commander between April 1 and Septem-
                 ber 30 (cycle A), payments will be authorized for the period October 1 through September
                 30.
                 21.3.4.4.1.2. For those who are certified between October 1 and March 31 (cycle B), pay-
                 ments will be authorized for the period April 1 through March 31.

      bers may receive. Per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 24, a member may be entitled to, and receive
      payment for, two different hazardous duty incentive pays in the same month.
      21.4.2. Policy. Reserve and guard members performing active duty for pay, for periods of 30 or more
      days, may be entitled to diving duty pay if they meet the other criteria established in the DoDFMR,
      Volume 7A.
      21.4.3. Supporting Documents. The member’s finance office pays diving duty pay based on Military
      Pay Orders certified by the member’s commander. The commander’s authorization must attest to the
      fact that the member has:
         21.4.3.1. A valid M-series order;
         21.4.3.2. Maintained diving proficiency by performing regular and frequent dives;
         21.4.3.3. Been assigned to a duty whose primary mission requires the member to perform diving

      22.6.2.4. DFAS-DE Bonus Actions
         22.6.2.4.1. Non-Paying Update: The daily update validates the B03 transactions against the
         bonus master and the MMPA. Valid transactions update the bonus master control record and
         the MMPA, and are computed for pay.
             22.6.2.4.1.1. Future payments may be verified via CICS inquiry of the Bonus Master or
             the MMPA.
         22.6.2.4.2. Paying Update: The B03, action code “6”, transactions are validated against bonus
         master control record and the MMPA on a paying update. See Table 22.7. for the B03 format.
             22.6.2.4.2.1. Valid transactions update the bonus master control record and the MMPA.
             22.6.2.4.2.2. Valid transactions from prior daily and the paying update are computed for
             actual pay.
         22.6.2.4.3. Bonuses are paid and combined with any other payment due on that paying update.
             22.6.2.4.3.1. Beginning in calendar year 1994, 28 percent FITW tax is withheld on the
             Bonus amount. Normal tax is withheld for all other pay for that paying update. Prior to
             1994, twenty percent FITW tax was withheld on the Bonus amount.
             22.6.2.4.3.2. Bonuses are subject to normal state tax withholding at the time of payment.
             22.6.2.4.3.3. The leave and earnings statement reflects the gross bonus payment as Bonus
             Type.
             22.6.2.4.3.4. The latest bonus payment made is reflected on the MMPA and the Bonus
             Master, both on microfiche and through the inquiry option on CICS.
             22.6.2.4.3.5. All deductions, including debts, are applied against Bonus amounts in accor-
             dance to established deduction amounts.
      22.6.2.5. Bonus Suspension and Release of Suspension.
         22.6.2.5.1. If a member is not entitled to a bonus at the prescribed time, AFMPC/PDS will
         send a B03, with action code “7”, to suspend the account. See Table 22.8. for this B03 format.
         22.6.2.5.2. During the suspended period, a bonus payment cannot be made.
         22.6.2.5.3. When the member is entitled to payment, AFMPC/PDS will submit a B03, with
         action code “8”, to release the account from suspension. See Table 22.8. for this B03 format.
         22.6.2.5.4. After a release from suspension is posted, a B03 transaction for payment, with
         action code “6”, may be submitted by the RC payroll office if the member meets all entitle-
         ment criteria. See Table 22.7. for this B03 format.
         22.6.2.5.5. If the B03, with action code “6”, is processed during the suspended period, it will
         recycle until the suspension is lifted. See Table 22.7. for this B03 format.
      22.6.2.6. Bonus Termination. To terminate a bonus input a B03 with action code “2”.
         22.6.2.6.1. Termination of affiliation bonuses (bonus types 7 and 8). The system will continue
         to systematically calculate debts for affiliation bonuses (bonus types 7 & 8).
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                        295


          22.6.2.6.1.1. The field, number months participation – bonus (positions 33-34), gives the
          number of months the member participated in the bonus program. If this field is 00 (two
          zeros), the bonus will be terminated and no further action is taken.
          22.6.2.6.1.2. If the number months participation – bonus field (positions 33-34) is greater
          than 00 (zeros), the system will compute the total amount of bonus due and compare it
          with the amount previously paid.
              22.6.2.6.1.2.1. Underpaid bonus at termination: The DJMS-RC generates a B03 to pay
              the balance due. The payment is made on a coded update. See Table 22.7. for the B03
              format. These payments are recorded on the MMPA and bonus master as installment
              number 9. If no previous payments have been made, a payment will not be generated.
              22.6.2.6.1.2.2. Termination-caused overpayment of bonus:
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.1. If a member has received bonus payments in advance of services
                  performed and recoupment is required, DJMS-RC will automatically generate a
                  DQ03 transaction to establish a debt and begin collection of that debt. As of 27
                  May 97, enlistee bonus debts will no longer be automatically suspended.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.2. A management notice will be included in the UH022-164 report
                  informing the member’s unit of the debt establishment with the amount and APC
                  used. The debt will also be placed on other reports as an open, collectable debt.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.3. A message will be placed on the member’s LES.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.4. The rate of collection will be two-thirds of member’s pay and
                  allowances. If another rate of collection is desired, a DQ07 must be input. See
                  DoDFMR, Volume 7A for collection guidelines.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.5. If the retention office manager determines the collection action is
                  incorrect or erroneous he or she will notify the RPO. The RPO will reduce debt col-
                  lection rate, input D18 to explain reduction, and send and MPO to DFAS-DE/FJP
                  to correct the bonus record.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.6. Regardless of which calendar year the debt is for or which year
                  collection is made, adjustments will be made to current year FITW and SITW
                  wages.
                  22.6.2.6.1.2.2.7. An explanation of DQ transaction is in Chapter 32.
       22.6.2.6.2. Termination of enlistment and reenlistment bonuses (bonus types 1 to 6). The sys-
       tem will not systematically calculate debts for bonus types 1 to 6. Because ANG members are
       now being paid different bonus amounts, DJMS-RC no longer performs calculation for bonus
       overpayment or underpayment when bonus types 1 to 6 are terminated, regardless of what is
       input in the B03-2 number of months participation field. Whether a member should receive an
       additional bonus payment or have a debt established must be determined by the local MPF and
       a B03-6 bonus payment or a DQ03 debt transaction must be manually input. Procedures for
       this process have been defined by HQ ANGRC. (AFRES makes bonus payments to members
       only after they have earned their installments so over and underpayments do not occur).
       22.6.2.6.3. Bonus Termination in Error – AFRES: If a termination has been recorded in error,
       the unit/CBPO must coordinate corrective actions with command points of contact (see para-
296                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             graph 22.6.2.2.) with AFRES. These offices will ensure verification and reversal of PDS and
             DJMS-RC recorded bonus contract termination data.
             22.6.2.6.4. Bonus Termination in Error – ANG: If a termination has been recorded in error, the
             CBPO inputs the B03 transactions (see Table 22.4.) with action code 3. A case is established
             at DFAS-DE/FJPA.
      22.6.3. Changing the Bonus Control Record – AFRES. When it is necessary to make a change to the
      bonus control record for bonus type or date of entitlement, the unit should contact their command
      points of contact (see paragraph 22.6.2.2.). These offices will perform compatible updating of PDS
      and DJMS-RC bonus contract data.
      22.6.4. Changing the Bonus Control Record – ANG.
         22.6.4.1. When it is necessary to make a change to the bonus control record for bonus type or date
         of entitlement, the unit CBPO should submit a B03, action type “3” (see Table 22.6.).
         22.6.4.2. When a B03, action type “3”, is submitted to change a bonus master, an MMPA for
         review is generated to the field via the UH022-176 report, with a message “REVIEW BONUS
         ADJ.”. See Table 22.6. for this B03 format.
      22.6.5. Changing the Bonus for Next (Correct) Installment Payable – AFRES/ANG. When it is nec-
      essary to make a change to the bonus control record for the next (correct) installment payable, submit
      an MPO or message to DFAS-DE/FJPA.
         22.6.5.1. Changes to the bonus type or installment number processed by DFAS-DE/FJPA will
         cause the amount last paid to be changed to zeros.
         22.6.5.2. Amount last paid will remain zeros until the next increment is posted with a B03, action
         type “6”, from the RC payroll office. See Table 22.7. for this B03 format.
         22.6.5.3. Changes to the date of enlistment, AFSC, or authorization number will not affect the
         amount last paid.
      22.6.6. Bonus Monthly Report. After the code 3 each month, the DJMS-RC system produces a sum-
      mary report of bonuses paid during the month. The report is forwarded to HQ USAF.
      22.6.7. Instructions on Using Report UH022-125 and 126, List of Bonus Masters. Report 125 is a list
      of all reservist bonus masters which have had activity within the last 18 months or have an anniversary
      date within the past three months or in the future. Report 126 is the same for guard members. You can
      access the reports in SAR region: JFRBONUS. The SAR report numbers are FR0125M (reserve) and
      FR0126M (guard). The reports are sorted by SSN within Bonus Master RPO with a page break on
      RPO. There are no column headings because the headings would interfere with the ability to load the
      report into a spreadsheet application. In place of column headings, this instruction has been written as
      explanation.

                            A. When there is a termination code in column 15, this is the date the
                            bonus
                                master was terminated.
                            B. When there is a suspension code in column 14, this is the date the bonus
                                master was suspended.
                            C. If there is no termination code or suspension code, this is the date the
                                member’s next installment is due or the anniversary date.
                            D. If it is blank, it means either there is no next installment due, or there

                                                Chapter 23

                        PARTIAL AND ADVANCE PAYMENT PROCEDURES

23.1. General Provisions.
      23.1.1. Purpose. This chapter provides procedures for the administration and payment of partial and
      advance payments to guard and reserve members.
      23.1.2. Applicability and Scope. This chapter applies to all eligible members of the Air National
      Guard and Air Force Reserves.
      23.1.3. Policy. Authority for paying partial and advance payments is contained in DoDFMR, Volume
      7A, Chapter 32 and DFAS-DE AIG message 201800Z May 93.
      23.1.4. Source Documents and References. The supporting documents for authorization and payment
      of partial and advance payments are as follows:
         23.1.4.1. DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher (reference Figure 23.1.).
         23.1.4.2. AF Form 1209, Document Transmittal Form (Air Force) (reference Figure 23.2.).
         23.1.4.3. AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour.
         23.1.4.4. AF Form 458, Statement of Tour of Duty.

23.2. Payment Type. Automated partial and advance payments are paid to members paid via electronic
funds transfer (EFT). If a member is not on EFT, no partial or advance payment is authorized.

23.3. Responsibilities.
      23.3.1. Manual Pay Procedures – DFAS Operations Interrupted or Member Not on Direct Deposit. In
      the event that DFAS operations are interrupted and alternate sites cannot be used to resume normal
      operations, or a member is not paid through EFT, FSOs must assume responsibility for payment. Man-
      ual pay procedures are as follows:
      23.3.2. Reserve Pay Office (RPO) Actions.
         23.3.2.1. Determines if the member is entitled to a partial, computes the partial payment, using
         only pay and allowances accrued to date less statutory deductions.
         23.3.2.2. Each payment must be properly certified before payment is made. Ensure the member
         has a bonafide emergency and does not abuse the pay system by requesting partial payments each
         time he/she performs active duty.
         23.3.2.3. RPO may not authorize a partial payment if the member’s duty transaction has been pro-
         cessed for payment. An exception may be made if the input transaction rejected and cannot be cor-
         rected prior to the scheduled pay run or if the member is on a tour of over 30 days and additional
         entitlements are available to offset the partial payment. If the partial payment will process before
         the tour transaction, a partial may be paid.
         23.3.2.4. RPO computes the partial payment amount. The amount is limited to pay and allow-
         ances accrued to date less all statutory deductions and debt collections. For example, if the mem-
         ber’s request is approved for a partial payment on the first day of an active duty tour, the member
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                309


      is entitled to one day pay and allowances less statutory deductions. Partial payments are not autho-
      rized for inactive duty.
      23.3.2.5. CICS input screens are located in Chapter 6 of this manual.
      23.3.2.6. RPO maintains a record of all partial payments in an authorization control log. The log
      must contain the following information: member’s name, SSN, amount, voucher date, fund cite,
      accounting classification, PACN. The PACN is a five position number composed of the first two
      positions of the unit PAS code plus three digits beginning with 001 through 999, then restarting
      with 001, for example, R3001 through R3999. All numbers must be used in sequence. If a pay-
      ment authorization is canceled, the control number is voided and will not be used again. The RPO
      maintains the control log on a fiscal year basis, opening a new control log at the start of a new fis-
      cal year. (Reference AFMAN 37-139, Table 177-5).
      23.3.2.7. Provides the computed amount and the pay authorization control number (PACN) to the
      FSO/DO making payment. Records PACN in voucher control log.
      23.3.2.8. Ensures a DW03, partial payment debt transaction, is input on the member’s pay record.
      Reference Chapter 32 for the transaction format.
      23.3.2.9. Verifies that the member’s pay account is set up for EFT. Informs member to check his
      or her financial institution to verify receipt of funds and deposit to the correct account prior to uti-
      lizing theses funds.
  23.3.3. FSO Actions
      23.3.3.1. Validates the request for payment by contacting the member’s reserve payroll office
      (RPO) for authorization to make a payment.
      23.3.3.2. For members not on EFT, prepares a DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher, recording the
      PACN on the voucher. Sends a copy of the voucher to the member’s RPO and DFAS-DE/FJPR,
      6760 E. Irvington Place, Denver CO, 80279-3000. Forwards a copy of the DD Form 117 to DFAS
      Central Site Military Pay Operations on the first workday after the date of the voucher.
  23.3.4. DFAS-DE/FJPR. In the event the RPO does not process a DW03, DFAS-DE/FJPR will input
  the debt transaction to ensure collection is made from the receiving member’s pay account. Report to
  DFAS-DE/FJPR, via cc:Mail, all payments that must be processed by central site. Provide the follow-
  ing information: SSN, name, PAS, MPF, amount, voucher date, and voucher number.
  23.3.5. Partial Payments – Member’s Request – Central Site Release. In an emergency, a member
  may request a partial payment from the RPO or the FSO at the active duty station by presenting a copy
  of active duty orders, military identification card, etc., in order to establish positive identification. Par-
  tial payments should be limited, however, to bonafide emergencies which cannot be resolved by
  proper planning by the member.
  23.3.6. FSOs Servicing Air Force Technical Training Centers. FSOs of the Air Education and Train-
  ing Command (AETC) servicing technical training centers will contact the ANG/NCO liaison (NCOs
  assigned to the technical training centers) to coordinate for ANG and AFRES members. The mem-
  ber’s unit can input partial payment transactions for these members.
  23.3.7. ANG/NCO Liaison Actions. Verifies identification of member and coordinates with RC pay-
  roll offices all partial payments to non-prior service members. Coordinates with member’s unit to
310                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      make sure an address change and pay transactions are submitted to the applicable DFAS center to
      update the member’s MMPA.
      23.3.8. Advance Payments – Member Requirements/Actions. RC members may, if authorized by
      DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 32, be paid an advance pay for permanent change of station, an
      advance of pay and allowances, advance of basic allowance for subsistence, an advance for members
      of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program on active duty, an advance of housing
      allowances, or an advance for ROTC cadets and midshipmen ordered to field training or practice

         for an advance of pay.
         23.3.8.2. Member requests advance pay from his or her unit commander, presenting copy of PCS
         orders and identification card.
         23.3.8.3. Member must accept a liquidation schedule which provides for repayment by termina-
         tion date of orders or date of separation, whichever occurs first.
         23.3.8.4. Amounts of one (1) month’s basic pay less deductions or, if warranted and approved by
         the member’s commander, an amount not more than three (3) month’s basic pay, less deductions,
         are authorized for advance pay. Computation is made in accordance with DoDFMR, Volume 7A,
         Table 32.1.
         23.3.8.5. Non-prior service members and Air Force enlistees may be paid advance pay not to

      address changes and pay transactions are submitted to DFAS central site military pay operations to
      update the member’s MMPA.

23.4. Voucher Preparation for Partial and Advance Payments.
      23.4.1. Purpose. Many guard and reserve members report to financial service organizations (FSOs) as
      well as reserve payroll offices (RPOs) to be paid partial and advance payments. An area that is impor-
      tant is the preparation of the pay voucher and the essential data elements that must be present to expe-
      dite the processing and accountability of that voucher. The following instructions apply to
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                        311


  organizations that prepare partial and advance payments for guard and reserve members paid by the
  defense joint military pay system – reserve component.
  23.4.2. Entitlement. Before you begin to prepare the voucher, verify whether or not the member is due
  a partial or advance payment.
     23.4.2.1. Verify the member is on active duty orders and has a valid ID card. A member perform-
     ing inactive duty is not authorized a partial or advance payment.
     23.4.2.2. If the member has a letter of authorization from their reserve payroll office (RPO), the
     amount of the payment is provided, as well as the accounting classification, and the payment
     authorization control number (PACN). The letter of authorization must be signed by someone
     within the RPO. If the member does not have written authorization with all of the required infor-
     mation, contact the member’s unit, verify the payment request and ask for a PACN.
  23.4.3. Preparing the Voucher. When preparing a DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher, for either a

         24.3.1.1.1. ANG recruiters
         24.3.1.1.2. ANG administrative support officers
         24.3.1.1.3. ANG performing support alert duties

     24.3.2.2. Must cite, in the accounting classifications, “Project 543” for the ANG.
  24.3.3. DJMS-AC/DJMS-RC – ANG Responsibilities.
     24.3.3.1. Active/RC payroll office processes the following transactions to access and process
     other personnel data changes (see tables referenced below):
         24.3.3.1.1. E2 – JUMPS Accessions (Table 24.9.)
         24.3.3.1.2. MD – Promotions/Demotions (Table 24.19.)
         24.3.3.1.3. 30 – Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) (Table 24.23., Table 24.24., and Table
         24.25.)
         24.3.3.1.4. LG – CBPO change (Table 24.17.)
         24.3.3.1.5. TU – DOS change (Table 24.20.)
         24.3.3.1.6. E5 – JUMPS Separations (Table 24.11., Table 24.12., Table 24.13., Table 24.14.,
         Table 24.15., and Table 24.16.)
         24.3.3.1.7. DB – SGLI (Table 24.8.)
         24.3.3.1.8. MC – Name Change (Table 24.18.)
     24.3.3.2. One month after the member is accessed to JUMPS/JSS-AC, verify an MM03/ML03
     has been processed by AFMPC. This transaction deletes the AFMPC “match flag.” If the match
     flag is not deleted, send a message to DFAS-DE/FJPB to confirm accession and request the
     MM03/ML03 be processed to delete the match flag. The member’s pay record will change to a
     “T” status (suspended) if the accession is not confirmed to remove the match flag.
     24.3.3.3. Affect of Changes from DJMS to DJMS-RC to DJMS. A delay in accession to DJMS is
     experienced when a member separates from the regular Air Force, joins the Air National Guard,
     and soon thereafter joins one of the programs identified in paragraph 24.3.1., “Identification of
     Member”, which requires the member be assessed DJMS with service component “G.”
         24.3.3.3.1. The service component “G” converts to “N” in the DJMS record for funding pur-
         poses.
         24.3.3.3.2. The original DJMS record remains in a “T” status (suspended) for 20 or more
         days, then converts to “V” status (separated) until month-end processing is complete.
318                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            24.3.3.3.3. If there are any discrepancies with the DJMS record while in “T” status, it will not
            convert to “V” status until the problem is resolved. The DJMS record cannot be accessed until
            the first update after the month-end processing that the member went to “V” status (reference
            AFMAN 65-116 V1).
      24.3.4. DJMS-RC/DJMS-AC Actions.
         24.3.4.1. Do not process any other transactions unless DFAS-DE releases the format to the RC
         payroll office.
         24.3.4.2. DFAS-DE/FJP processes data normally input by PDS upon receipt of a message from
         the RC payroll office detailing the necessary change.
         24.3.4.3. DJMS AFO processes all other transactions, per AFMAN 65-116 V1, for the regular Air
         Force members.
         24.3.4.4. The RC payroll office processes the following to suspend the ANG/DJMS-RC MMPA:
            24.3.4.4.1. Inputs an A24 transaction (see Table 24.26.) to suspend the member’s DJMS-RC
            MMPA. Use pay status code “K” for officers and airmen. This will put the DOS on the
            DJMS-RC MMPA.
            24.3.4.4.2. See Table 9.1. for pay status code definitions.
         24.3.4.5. Leave Record Processing. If the member is performing a long tour of active duty paid in
         DJMS-RC immediately before starting the DJMS tour, the RC payroll office:
            24.3.4.5.1. Closes and certifies the AF Form 1934.
                24.3.4.5.1.1. Annotates the AF Form 1934 with the statement, “Transferred DJMS-RC to
                DJMS-AC” and the effective date.
                24.3.4.5.1.2. Includes the total number of leave days paid since 10 Feb 1976 and the bal-
                ance of leave including the zero balance on the AF Form 1934.
            24.3.4.5.2. The member’s unit supervisor controls and processes the leave documents as pre-
            scribed in AFMAN 65-116 V1.
            24.3.4.5.3. The AFO inputs leave transactions based on the controlled leave documents sub-
            mitted by the unit supervisor or the AFO travel section for travel related leave.
            24.3.4.5.4. DFAS-DER 7010-3 applies when member uses leave while in a travel status.
         24.3.4.6. Point Credit Accounting and Reporting System (PCARS). There is no DJMS-PCARS
         interface and members not paid by DJMS-RC cannot be reported by the DJMS-RC-PCARS inter-
         face. The CBPO must report points per AFMAN 26-2622 V1.
      24.3.5. DJMS-AC Transactions. The RC payroll office inputs the accession to DJMS-AC using the
      E203 transaction (see Table 24.9.), and:
         24.3.5.1. Sends a copy of AF Form 1934 to DFAS-DE/FJP only to update DJMS-AC for unused
         days when leave is being carried forward from a consecutive RC tour.
         24.3.5.2. Prepares the E5 separation transaction (see Table 24.11.) to remove a member from
         DJMS-AC when the ordered period has expired or tour has been terminated.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            319


         24.3.5.2.1. When preparing an E5, obtain the SPD OFF or SPD AMN field (positions 26-28)
         information from the servicing CBPO.
         24.3.5.2.2. The CHARACTER OF DISCHARGE (position 46), in the E5 transaction, should
         always be a “1” (honorable) since action is to close the DJMS-AC MMPA because the active
         duty tour is terminated and not an actual discharge.
     24.3.5.3. To extend a tour for an enlisted member, the RC payroll office:
         24.3.5.3.1. Prepares and inputs a TU transaction (see Table 24.20.). Makes sure that the mem-
         ber will continue on active duty before processing the TU transaction.
         24.3.5.3.2. To extend a tour for an officer, sends message to DFAS-DE/FJPA requesting an
         extension.
         24.3.5.3.3. To pay accrued leave upon extension of a tour, submits AF Form 1934 and a copy
         of the order attached to a DD Form 114 to DFAS-DE/FJP for processing.
         24.3.5.3.4. Prepares an A24 transaction (see Table 24.26.) as required (See also Chapter 9,
         “Active Duty”).
         24.3.5.3.5. Prepare text header and text trailer for AUTODIN transmission (see Table 24.21.
         and Table 24.22.).
  24.3.6. Clarification or Correction of the DJMS-AC Transactions.
     24.3.6.1. Position 1. Position (1) of each transaction indicates the number of formats required for
     the transaction.
         24.3.6.1.1. If position one (1) equals “0” (zero), there is only the prime (one) in the transac-
         tion.
         24.3.6.1.2. Code “A” means there is one prime transaction and one trailer.
         24.3.6.1.3. Code “B” means there is one prime transaction and two trailers.
     24.3.6.2. These transactions must be submitted in this sequence. For instance, if position (1)
     equals “B”, the sequence must be B, 1, 2.
     24.3.6.3. Partial and Complete Rejects – DJMS-AC. There are two types of rejects: Partial and
     complete.
         24.3.6.3.1. A partial reject is identified by a “Y” in the first position of the rejected transac-
         tion. A partial reject requires a review to determine if further action is required.
         24.3.6.3.2. A complete reject is identified by a “Z” in the first position. A complete reject
         requires correction and re-input of the transaction, if necessary.
     24.3.6.4. Corrected DJMS-AC Transactions
         24.3.6.4.1. Corrected DJMS-AC transactions are reinput using the same information in posi-
         tions 68-80 as the original transaction.
         24.3.6.4.2. The TXHDR card must have the next available transmission number.
320                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


             24.3.6.4.3. If a new transmission number is not used in the TXHDR cards, the transmission
             will not process and an XU03 management notice for a duplicate transmission will be
             received.
         24.3.6.5. Management Notices – DJMS-AC.
             24.3.6.5.1. DFAS-DE sends an acknowledgment of receipt of transmission to the RC payroll
             office by management notice XT03, “Acknowledgment of DFAS-DE receipt of DJMS-RC
             input”.
             24.3.6.5.2. DFAS-DE sends an XU03 management notice to RC payroll offices whenever a
             transmission number is missing. This management notice alerts the RC payroll office that
             DFAS-DE did not receive a particular transmission based on transmission number logged pre-
             viously.
             24.3.6.5.3. Where RC payroll offices use the same communication facilities as an active duty
             AFO and/or CBPO, the RC payroll office needs to coordinate with communication centers and
             the active duty AFO and CBPO to make sure that they get their management notices. The
             AUTODIN header cards for these transmissions will indicate that this is ARPASMISCLNS
             data and can be identified as being different from other DJMS transmissions by the CBPO
             code in positions 66-67 of the header card.
             24.3.6.5.4. DFAS-DE sends management notices to the servicing payroll office for AGR
             members when their tours are expiring.
      24.3.7. Checks to Financial Organizations (Fos). Members are expected to participate in the direct
      deposit program. The member furnishes an address for the mailing of the DFAS Form 702, Army/Air
      Force Leave and Earnings Statement (Active and Reserve), and the TD Form W-2, Wage and Tax
      Statement.
      24.3.8. Deductions from Pay.
         24.3.8.1. ANG members who participate in the ANG State Sponsored Life Insurance Program
         (SSLI) in DJMS-RC may continue to do so in DJMS.
         24.3.8.2. Members must start an allotment in the DJMS system in order to continue their partici-
         pation in SSLI.
         24.3.8.3. See 31.2., “Section B – NG State Sponsored Group Life Insurance (SSLI)” for more
         information.
      24.3.9. State Income Tax Withholding.
         24.3.9.1. Members are subject to the withholding for state income taxes for the state and local tax-
         ing authority as coded in the DJMS-RC MMPA.
         24.3.9.2. Members must complete a DD Form 2058, and claim state of legal residency.
         24.3.9.3. See Chapter 30, “Federal/State Income Tax, Federal Insurance Contributions”.
      24.3.10. AGR Tours Terminating.
         24.3.10.1. Normal DJMS-RC MMPA Reactivation. When an AGR tour is terminated, the RC
         payroll office reactivates the DJMS-RC file by processing the following transactions:
             24.3.10.1.1. A24 transaction to curtail the “K” status. See Table 24.26.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            321


          24.3.10.1.2. A09 transaction (see Table 2.12.), and
          24.3.10.1.3. A06, A07, and A08 to reactivate the pay account. See Table 2.6., Table 2.7., and
          Table 2.8. for the A06, A07, and A08 transactions.
      24.3.10.2. Forced Gain Processing.
          24.3.10.2.1. In those few cases where a “forced gain” must be accomplished, the RC payroll
          offices will prepare a message requesting DFAS-DE/FJP input an AA1 transaction (see Table
          43.33.). A forced gain may be required when the CBPO has not submitted the AA1 and the
          member cannot be paid.
          24.3.10.2.2. Provide all date for the transaction using the day after separation from DJMS-AC
          as the effective date of gain and request a space in the non-prior service indicator.
          24.3.10.2.3. When a master file for review appears on UH022-176 with message “GAIN TO
          FILE,” the RC payroll office will submit the A06, A07, A08, and D18 transactions (see Table
          2.6., Table 2.7., Table 2.8., and Table 43.29., respectively, for record formats) to complete the
          MMPA.
          24.3.10.2.4. Special attention must be paid to LEAVE INDICATOR field (position 28),
          DESERT SHIELD/STORM INDICATOR (position 29), and PRIOR SERVICE LEAVE
          SOLD (positions 30-32) of the A06 transaction (leave information). (See Table 2.6.)
          24.3.10.2.5. Use an “X” in position 28, a “3” in position 29, and the total number of leave days
          paid the member after 9 Feb 1976 (include leave paid on AGR tour) in positions 30-32 of the
          A06.
          24.3.10.2.6. D18 comments should include “MBR Term AGR tour eff (date) LV paid (num-
          ber) days.”
   24.3.11. Disposition of DJMS Supporting Documents.
      24.3.11.1. The RC payroll office makes an 80/80 listing of input transactions and attaches a copy
      of the supporting document to the listing. Enter on the listing the installation name and address
      along with certification that the documents are true and proper. The listing must be certified by the
      person in charge (designee) of the input office.
      24.3.11.2. Attach a copy of the DJMS accession or separation orders to the 80/80 listing.
      24.3.11.3. Retire with DJMS-RC supporting documents by Julian date of submission per Chapter
      3, “Documentation Preparation and Submission Procedures”. If there are relatively few docu-
      ments, use a regular manila folder.

24.4. Section D – ANG – Enlist in the Regular Air Force – No Break in Service.
   24.4.1. Procedures. In order to prevent a financial hardship on members who separate from active
   duty as ANG members currently being paid under DJMS-AC, and who enlist in the regular Air Force
   with no break in service, the following procedures must be followed:
      24.4.1.1. Enlisted Personnel. RC payroll offices must send a message to DFAS-DE/FJP before the
      date member is projected to separate, requesting DFAS-DE/FJP to input an E503 (see Table
      24.11.).
      24.4.1.2. The message must contain the following information:
322                                                             AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         24.4.1.2.1. Date of separation from ANG
         24.4.1.2.2. Date of enlistment in regular Air Force
         24.4.1.2.3. Number of years enlisted
         24.4.1.2.4. Servicing AFO.
         24.4.1.2.5. Servicing CBPO.
         24.4.1.2.6. Expiration term of service (ETS) from the ANG.
         24.4.1.2.7. Leave Election. If member is within 3 months of ETS (item 6 above), leave bal-
         ance may be sold or carried forward.
      24.4.1.3. Information copies of the message must be sent to the following organizations:
         24.4.1.3.1. HQ AFMPC/MPCDMD-1
         24.4.1.3.2. ACFP at member’s gaining AFO
         24.4.1.3.3. DPMD and DPMUM at member’s gaining command CBPO
      24.4.1.4. Since ANG members’ initial clothing issue is less than regular Air Force initial clothing
      issue, the gaining AFO must process a PT03 type 4/5 transaction. This is to report difference
      between the two initial issues and to establish a CMA.
         24.4.1.4.1. AFMPC/MPCDMD-1 will provide instructions to the gaining CBPO for its pro-
         cessing on a case by case basis.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                323

   roactive entitlement for FDP, HFP, VHA, and FSA.

   cessing procedures.

27.4. Control of OHA and Cola Payments. The C05 transaction may be input and paid on the same
update as the C01.

      formats.

27.5. Manual Pay Adjustment.
      27.5.1. Pay adjustments that result in a one-time payment that cannot be processed through the
      DJMS-RC will be manually processed by the appropriate DFAS-DE/FJP section using DD Form 114.
      27.5.2. The payment is computed and AF Forms 1965 and 1961 are prepared and forwarded to the
      Pay Distribution Branch for voucher preparation. The voucher is then forwarded to DFAS-DE/WFCC
      for check preparation.
      27.5.3. When the RC payroll office disagrees with a manual pay computation made by DFAS-DE, the
      worksheet providing the payroll office’s computation will be forwarded to DFAS-DE/FJPA for
      recomputation and resolution of the problem.

27.7. A Tin Retroactive Processing for Long Tour Periods of Active Duty Entitlements. This para-
graph pertains only to long tour periods of active duty entitlements. It does NOT pertain to periods of IDT
and short tours of active duty. When the system is going to make an adjustment, it takes the start date of
the transaction and then reads what or if the member has been paid. When it comes upon the first occur-
rence of payment, it will not make further adjustments.

27.8. “A” Transactions. The following “A” transactions will systematically generate TIN C03, C04, or
C05 transactions as appropriate. (The formats for these transactions are shown at the end of this chapter.)


       TIN A30        “BAH II Long Tour”
       TIN A31        “BAS Long Tour”
       TIN A32        “BAH”
       TIN A32C       “COLA”
       TIN A33        “FSA II Long Tour”
       TIN A34        “Foreign Duty Tour”
       TIN A35        “Hostile Fire Pay”


   27.8.1. TIN A30 (BAH II Long Tour): Only process this TIN to pay BAH II without dependents. TIN
   A30 will generate a TIN C04 to pay BAH II without dependents. (When the A30 is processed, the sys-
   tem will only collect partial rate BAH and then repay BAH II. If anything other than partial BAH has
   been paid, the system will not collect and repay.) Refer to Table 14.5. for the TIN A30 format.
   27.8.2. TIN A31 (BAS Long Tour): Only process for enlisted grades 31 – 39. Officers and warrant
   officers receive BAS automatically when on long tours of active duty. Only process against the fol-
   lowing types of BAS: B (Separate Rations), H (Rations-in-Kind not available), K (Emergency
   Rations), and P (Partial BAS). Type N (No Entitlement or Officer BAS) does not require any A-TIN
   Retro-Processing. (Refer to Table 13.4. for the TIN A31 Format.)
       27.8.2.1. A retro adjustment will be made if there was no BAS entitlement received. In this case,
       the TIN A31 will computer generate a TIN C04 to pay the BAS entitlement.
       27.8.2.2. A retro adjustment will be made if the BAS entitlement posted previously does not
       match the BAS entitlement in TIN 31. In this situation, the TIN A31 will generate a TIN C03 to
       collect the BAS entitlement, then generate a TIN C04 to pay the BAS entitlement.
   27.8.3. TIN A32 (BAH): Used to pay BAH I for long tours. If the VHA-STR in positions 16-21 =
   ‘00000’, the system will not generate any “C” TINs. If other than BAH II or BAH partial has been
   previously reported for the period, TINs C03 and C05 will not be generated. Field will have to deter-
   mine and submit C03/C05’s as appropriate. (Refer to Table 16.1. for the TIN A32 format, refer to
   Table 32.3. for the C03 format, and to Table 27.5. for the C05 format).
366                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      27.8.4. TIN A32C (COLA): Used to pay COLA for long tours. If there is a “9” in position 40 of TIN
      A32, the system will compare the COLA-DA-RATE in positions 33-36 with what has previously been
      reported for COLA. If nothing was previously posted for COLA, then the system will generate a TIN
      C05 to pay the entitlement. If COLA was previously paid, then process the TIN A32C, but the system
      will not generate any “C” TINs. The field will have to determine and submit C03/C05’s as appropri-
      ate. (Refer to Table 16.2. for the TIN A32C format, to Table 32.3. for the C03 format, and Table 27.5.
      for the C05 format.)
         27.8.4.1. When an A32C is input for a retro period of February through March in a non-leap year,
         the system will stop payment on February 28 and will not pick it up on March 1. For example, a
         32C for February 15 through March 30, totally retro and no previous payment has been made, TIN
         C05 will be generated for February 15 through 28 only. The system was programmed this way
         because COLA rates typically change every 15 days and we cannot assume that the March rate
         would be the same as the February rate.
      27.8.5. TIN A33 (FSA II Long Tour): If FSA II Long Tour has not been paid, then system will create
      TIN C05. However, if FSA II Long Tour has been paid, the system will not create any “C” TINS. The
      field will have to determine and submit C03/C05’s as appropriate (Refer to Table 17.1. for the TIN
      A33 format, to Table 32.3. for the C03 format, and Table 27.5. for the C05 format).
      27.8.6. TIN A34 (Hardship Duty Pay): If the HDP-STR (positions 16-31) in TIN A34 is greater than
      zero (and is a valid date) and Hardship Duty Pay has not been paid, then the system will generate TIN
      C05 to pay the entitlement (Refer to Table 21.1. for the TIN A34 format). If Hardship Duty has been
      paid, the system will not generate any “C” TINS.
         27.8.6.1. If HDP-STR (positions 16-21) in TIN A34 = zeros, then the system will not generate
         any “C” TINs. Field will have to determine and submit C03/C05’s as appropriate (Refer to Table
         32.3. for the C03 format and Table 27.5. for the C05 format).
      27.8.7. TIN A35 (Hostile Fire Pay): This is a monthly entitlement. A member only needs to perform
      one day in a Hostile Fire Pay status to receive the whole month entitlement. A member cannot receive
      this entitlement more than once a month regardless of multiple tours posted to the HF1 (Refer to Table
      21.2. for the TIN A35 format).
         27.8.7.1. The system will generate retroactive payment of Hostile Fire Pay only when no previous
         payment has been paid. The system will not collect and repay these entitlements.
         27.8.7.2. If HFP-STR (position 16-21) in TIN A35 = zeros, the system will not generate any “C”
         TINs. Field will have to determine and submit C03/C05’s as appropriate (Refer to Table 32.3. and
         Table 27.5. for the C03 and C05 formats).
      27.8.8. On the above transactions, if duplicate A-TINs come in on the same person within one update,
      a management notice will be sent to the field stating duplicate input and no adjustment action will be
      taken. The transaction will post to the MMPA, but no payment will be made. If the A-TINs are posted
      to the MMPA before the A24 is input, all transactions will pay out with the A24. If the A24 is posted
      before the entitlement A-TINs are posted, the A-TINs will retroactively pay on the next coded update.

27.9. Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA). Reserve and Guard members who are eli-
gible for food stamp assistance and are on active duty tours, are authorized to receive FSSA. This entitle-
ment is payable effective May 1, 2001. FSSA payments cannot exceed $500 per month.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          367


   27.9.1. To make an FSSA payment, submit a MPO to DFAS-PMJPR/DE. Central site will input a
   D02 transaction, with COP ‘W7’, along with a D18 and D19. In the entitlements section of the LES,
   the LES remark will be “FSSA payment”.
   27.9.2. This central site workaround will be used to pay FSSA until DJMS-RC is modified to accept
   D02s from the field with COPS of “FE” for FSSA payment and “FF” for FSSA incapacitation pay. No
   accounting processing code (APC) will be needed to pay this entitlement.

                                                Chapter 28

                                            MOBILIZATION

28.1. General.
   28.1.1. Scope. Mobilization is designed to support the United States Air Force ability to rapidly mobi-
   lize Air Reserve Forces (ARF). The ARF includes Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force
   Reserve Retirees, and Regular Air Force Retirees. The scope of mobilization requires the support of
   multiple functional areas and the interface of various pay systems. It begins with the issuance of a
   mobilization order, continues through deployment of the units and individuals, and concludes upon
   their demobilization.
   28.1.2. Authority. Authority to activate, mobilize, or recall ARF resides in Public Law and the United
   States Code. Multiple authorities such as Presidential Executive Orders, Congressional action, federal
   regulations and service department regulations may dictate specific mobilization procedures and
   requirements. For purposes of pay processing procedures as outlined in this chapter, distinctions are
   not made between differing mobilization authorizations such as Selective Mobilization, Total Mobili-
   zation, or Presidential Selected Reserve Call-Up. If different authorizations result in eligibility to spe-
   cific entitlements or changes in mobilization procedures, units will be notified of such developments.
   28.1.3. Methods of Mobilization. The Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard will use the same
   procedures to mobilize members under most circumstances. Where there are provisions unique to a
   particular member status or component, such differences will be noted. Current procedures pay all
   mobilized Air Reserve Forces through the Defense Joint Military Pay System-Reserve Component
   (DJMS-RC), except for Air Force Individual Ready Reservists (IRRs) with Personnel Account Sym-
   bol (PAS) 97 who will be paid through the Defense Joint Military Pay System-Active Component
   (DJMS-AC).

28.2. Member Preparation For Mobilization. Mobilization will proceed more smoothly if the mem-
ber’s records are current and properly maintained at the unit level prior to the time of mobilization. Mem-
bers must be on direct deposit upon being mobilized. Verify the member has direct deposit and that the
correct institution will be receiving the member’s funds. When members report for mobilization, they
need to bring a copy of their latest leave and earnings statement (LES) to the mobilization site. They
should also give a copy of this same LES to their spouse or other person who will assist in managing their
funds while the member is in a mobilized status. In addition, the member should bring all necessary doc-
umentation needed to establish a correct record, i.e. number of dependents, entitlement to basic allowance
for quarters (BAQ), variable housing allowance (VHA), etc., when reporting for mobilization. Refer to
the appropriate chapter to determine the required documents. (Previous procedures to semi-annually cre-
ate test mobilization LES’s have become cost prohibitive and are no longer being exercised.)

28.3. Notification. The initial notification of mobilization goes to the Air Force Military Personnel Cen-
ter (AFMPC) from Headquarters USAF. AFMPC sends transactions through the Personnel Data System
(PDS) to DFAS-DE for members who will be mobilized. Mobilization transactions, while flowing
through PDS from AFMPC, may be initiated from multiple transmission sources, such as Air Reserve
Personnel Center (ARPC), Military Personnel Flights (MPF) (formerly Consolidated Base Personnel
Office (CBPOs)), etc.
382                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


28.4. Mobilization Transactions.
      28.4.1. Following is a list of the mobilization transactions AFMPC will forward to DFAS-DE to
      affect a mobilization. A brief description follows each transaction. Detailed effects of the transactions
      are discussed in paragraph 28.5.
         28.4.1.1. 977 - places a member’s Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) in a mobilized status.
         28.4.1.2. 976 - changes a mobilized member’s starting date.
         28.4.1.3. 975 - cancels mobilization.
         28.4.1.4. 974 - deletes a recycling 977 transaction.
         28.4.1.5. 978 - terminates mobilization.
      28.4.2. Members assigned to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units who are mobilized and
      paid through DJMS-RC will continue to be serviced through their RC payroll office. However, the
      payroll office does not submit mobilization transactions. These transactions will be submitted by
      AFMPC or the Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Denver Center, Directorate of Military Pay,
      Pay Services Division (DFAS-DE/FJP).
      28.4.3. The mobilization information provided in this chapter assists units in monitoring the status of
      their members. They must contact the appropriate offices such as DFAS-DE/FJP or AFMPC if a mem-
      ber’s MMPA reflects an incorrect status. Mobilization transactions are shown on appropriate reports.
      Units will continue to submit non-mobilization transactions when the member continues to be paid on
      DJMS-RC.

28.5. Effects of Mobilization Transactions for Members Mobilized and Paid on DJMS-RC.
      28.5.1. General. The following information explains the effects on members’ MMPAs when mobi-
      lized and receiving payments through DJMS-RC. For information regarding Individual Ready
      Reservists (PAS 97) who are mobilized and paid on DJMS-AC, see paragraph 28.8.
      28.5.2. Mobilization Transaction Descriptions.
         28.5.2.1. TIN 977. Mobilizes ANG and Reserve members (except IRRs) on DJMS-RC. When
         TIN 977 is received, if the date of mobilization is the current date or earlier, it will process. When
         the 977 locates a matching record, a long tour is established on the member’s MMPA effective the
         date of mobilization. On the MMPA’s pay status area, in the PAY-STATUS field, the letter “P” is
         inserted. In the field PAY-STAT-STR-DT, the effective date of mobilization is inserted (YYM-
         MDD). The field PAY-STAT-STP-DT is filled with a date two years minus one day (YYMMDD)
         from the date of mobilization. Conflicting duty or training dates on the MMPA during the period
         of mobilization will be automatically terminated and debts will be created if in order. If TIN 977
         has a mobilization date later than the current date but less than 30 days in the future, TIN 977 will
         recycle until the mobilization date has been reached. If the mobilization date is more than 30 days
         in the future, TIN 977 will reject. Units are to monitor DJMS-RC reports as processed, recycled,
         and rejected transactions will be shown on appropriate reports. Rejected 977 transactions will be
         shown on JUMPS-RF Action Items – DFAS-DE/FJ (PCN: UH022-116, Parts 1 and 2). If a new
         TIN 977 is needed units are to contact AFMPC and request a new TIN 977 be transmitted.
         28.5.2.2. TIN 976. Changes the effective date of mobilization for a member whose record reflects
         a mobilized status or whose TIN 977 has been recycled awaiting a mature mobilization date. If
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              383


      TIN 977 has been submitted and the DJMS-RC MMPA shows the member in a mobilized status,
      TIN 976 will change the starting date of the tour to either earlier or later based upon the date in the
      976 transaction. The DJMS-RC MMPA PAY-STAT-STR-DT and PAY-STAT-STP-DT fields will
      show the adjusted dates. If TIN 977 has been recycled, the 976 will change the appropriate date on
      the recycling 977 prior to processing. All appropriate adjustments to the MMPA, such as creating
      a debt due to a later starting date of mobilization or paying an adjustment due to an earlier begin-
      ning date, will be made as a result of the processing 976.
      28.5.2.3. TIN 975. Cancels a mobilized record effective the beginning date of mobilization. A
      debt will be created if pay and entitlements have been paid. The pay status area on the MMPA will
      be changed. “P” will be removed from the field PAY-STATUS and “A” will be inserted. In
      PAY-STAT-STR-DT and PAY-STAT-STP-DT fields, 000000s and 999999s will be inserted respec-
      tively. The MMPA will be ready to pay any new periods of active duty, UTAs, AFTPs, etc.
      28.5.2.4. TIN 974. Cancels a matching, recycling TIN 977. No adjustments are made to the
      MMPA since the DJMS-RC record has not been changed to reflect a mobilized status. The TIN
      974, after deleting the recycling 977, will be shown on the PCN: UH022-0160 report. If no match-
      ing, recycling 977 is located, the 974 is rejected and will be shown on the PCN: UH022-116
      report.
      28.5.2.5. TIN 978. Terminates a mobilized tour on the DJMS-RC MMPA effective the ending
      date shown in the 978 transaction by creating an A24 stop transaction. The MMPA pay status area,
      field PAY-STAT-STP-DT is changed to the ending date of mobilization. After the A24 stop trans-
      action processes, the MMPA can pay new periods of duty.

28.6. Mobilization and Recall System (MRS). MRS is a stand-alone system which generates transac-
tions between DJMS-RC and DJMS-AC when a Reservist or Guard member on DJMS-RC is mobilized
and is paid on DJMS-AC. MRS also generates transactions when information must flow from DJMS-AC
to DJMS-RC.

28.7. Air Force Individual Ready Reserves (IRRS). Current procedures support the payment of mobi-
lized Air Force Individual Ready Reservists (PAS 97) through DJMS-AC. MRS supports this process.

28.8. Effects of Mobilization Transactions when Member is Mobilized and Paid on DJMS-AC.
   28.8.1. General. The following information explains the effects on both DJMS-RC and DJMS-AC’s
   MMPAs when the member is mobilized and will be paid through the DJMS-AC. The DJMS-RC
   record is suspended while the member is paid through the DJMS-AC. When the member who is being
   paid on DJMS-AC is demobilized, the DJMS-AC record is terminated and the ability to again make
   payments under DJMS-RC is restored. Current plans call for only IRRs (PAS 97) to be paid on
   DJMS-AC upon their mobilization. If there is a change in policy and other categories of members will
   be paid on DJMS-AC upon their mobilization, the appropriate announcement will be made.
   28.8.2. TIN 977. When the 977 is received in DJMS-RC from AFMPC, the following changes are
   made to the member’s DJMS-RC MMPA:
      28.8.2.1. Effects on Mobilization History and Pay Status Areas. In the area of Mobilization His-
      tory, in the field ACTIVE-DUTY-CODE, the status “S” is inserted; in the MMPA’s
      ACT-DTY-STR-DATE field, the date of mobilization (YYMMDD) is inserted; in the MMPA’s
384                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         ACT-DTY-STP-DATE field, the date “991231” is inserted. In the DJMS-RC MMPA Pay Status
         area, the field PAY-STATUS will reflect code “A”. PAY-STAT-STR-DT and PAY-STAT-STP-DT
         fields will be filled with “000000” and “999999” respectively. Further payments on DJMS-RC are
         barred effective the date of mobilization until such time as the member stops receiving payments
         on DJMS-AC and is demobilized.
         28.8.2.2. Effects of TIN 977 on DJMS-AC. Upon mobilization and submission of TIN 977 to
         DJMS-RC for those members who will be paid on DJMS-AC, the mobilization recall system
         (MRS) creates and submits the following transactions to DJMS-AC: accession, LES address, tax-
         ing authority, basic allowance for quarters, federal income tax withholding (FITW)/state income
         tax withholding (SITW), FITW exemptions, electronic funds transfer information, annual leave
         sold, demolition pay, flight pay, parachute pay, dental pay, medical pay, veterinarian pay, optome-
         trist pay, consolidated base personnel office and major command identifier, and servicemen’s
         group life insurance, as appropriate. Refer to DFAS-DEM 7073-1 for further information regard-
         ing DJMS-AC MMPAs.
      28.8.3. TIN 976. When the 976 is submitted to DJMS-RC for an MMPA which previously was sus-
      pended by a 977 transaction, in the Mobilization History area of the DJMS-RC MMPA, the
      ACT-DTY-STR-DATE field is changed to the new start date. A transaction is sent to the MRS for
      DJMS-AC to adjust the member’s start date on the DJMS-AC MMPA.
      28.8.4. TIN 975. When the 975 is submitted to DJMS-RC, it sends a notice to MRS to cancel the
      member’s mobilization on DJMS-AC. On the DJMS-RC MMPA in the Mobilization History area, the
      ACTIVE-DUTY-CODE “S” is removed. ACT-DTY-STR-DATE and ACT-DTY-STP-DATE fields
      are replaced with 000000s. There is no adjustment in the DJMS-RC MMPA Pay Status area. This
      action permits the payment of duty through DJMS-RC since the member’s MMPA reflects the mem-
      ber is not mobilized nor being paid through DJMS-AC.
      28.8.5. TIN 974. This transaction will have no impact on a DJMS-RC MMPA which reflects a mobi-
      lization on DJMS-AC. If a 974 is submitted to DJMS-RC, it searches DJMS-RC for a recycled TIN
      977. Finding none, it rejects and is shown on PCN: UH022-116 report.
      28.8.6. TIN 978. When the member is demobilized and no longer paid through DJMS-AC, an E503
      transaction is submitted to DJMS-AC. This places the DJMS-AC MMPA in suspended status and
      MRS flows a TIN 978 to DJMS-RC. The 978 uses the date of separation from the E503 and inserts it
      in DJMS-RC MMPA ACT-DTY-STP-DATE. This action indicates the member is no longer receiving
      payments on DJMS-AC.

28.9. Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI). SGLI is a separate deduction item under both
DJMS-AC and RC; therefore, an allotment method is not used to pay the premium rate under either sys-
tem. For those members mobilized on DJMS-RC, there is no change in the SGLI coverage previously
selected. For those members mobilized and paid through DJMS-AC, the SGLI coverage will be the same
as that selected under DJMS-RC. Premium payments will be initiated in DJMS-AC and suspended on
DJMS-RC. Premium payments on DJMS-RC will be reinstituted once payments cease on DJMS-AC. If a
member wishes to change the level of SGLI coverage, all changes must be initiated through the personnel
office.
28.10. Air National Guard (ANG) State Sponsored Life Insurance Program (SSLI). A N G m e m -
bers who are enrolled in SSLI and mobilized on DJMS-RC will continue to be enrolled during the period
of mobilization. The SSLI deduction will also continue upon demobilization.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            385


                                              Chapter 29

                         LEAVE POLICY, ACCOUNTING, AND PAYMENT

29.1. Section A – Leave Policy.
   29.1.1. Authority. The statutory authority for leave accrual by members of the Reserve Forces is 10
   U.S.C. 701. Authority for payment of unused accrued leave and pay and allowances while in a leave
   status is 37 U.S.C. 501.
   29.1.2. Entitlement
       29.1.2.1. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 560106, for leave entitlement, and table 56-2 for
       those days of active duty for which the member is entitled to pay and allowances and lump-sum
       settlement of accrued leave.
       29.1.2.2. Members of the Reserve Forces, on active duty for more than 29 days, accrue leave at
       the rate of one-half (1/2) calendar day for every 6 days on active duty in a pay status, with a max-
       imum of two and one-half (2 1/2) calendar days for each 30 consecutive days, including allowable
       travel time. Members do not accrue leave for periods of duty in a non-pay status.
       29.1.2.3. Member earns tax excludable leave when leave is earned while serving on active duty in
       a combat zone (CZ), or qualified hazardous duty area (QHDA). Members earn .5 days for every 6
       days served in a CZ or QHDA, with a maximum of 2.5 days for every 30 consecutive days. If the
       member serves a portion of the 30 consecutive active duty days outside a CZ or QHDA and is eli-
       gible to accrue leave, that leave is included in the tax excludable balance. Reference Chapter 30,
       paragraph 30.9., for further information.
   29.1.3. Accrual and Carryover. Conditions for the accrual, carryover, or lump-sum settlement of leave
   unique to the Air Reserve Forces are as follows:
       29.1.3.1. When a member performs consecutive tours, accrued leave may be carried over until
       completion of the final tour or member may elect to be paid for the unused accrued leave at the
       end of each tour. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 56016.
       29.1.3.2. When a member is ordered to active duty for less than 30 consecutive days and the order
       is amended to extend the tour to 30 consecutive days or more, member is entitled to accrue leave.
       29.1.3.3. When a member performs active duty for 30 or more consecutive days on consecutive
       tours, the member accrues leave even though member performs duty on separate orders for lesser
       periods of time.
       29.1.3.4. When member is ordered to active duty for 30 consecutive days or more and the order is
       amended to reduce the period of the tour to less than 30 days, member does not accrue leave.
       29.1.3.5. When a non-prior-service enlistee is ordered to initial active duty training, the member
       carries over the accrued unused leave each phase of the training until completion of the final phase
       and member reverts to inactive duty training status.
   29.1.4. Continuation of Tour because of Disability Due to Injury or Disease. When a member is con-
   tinued in a pay and allowance status beyond end date of a tour because of disability due to injury or
   disease, the member does not accrue leave on the continued period. See the DoDFMR, Volume 7A,
   paragraph 560604.
386                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      29.1.5. Forfeiture of Accrued Leave. Certain members, enlisted or commissioned, on or after 19
      October 1984, and involuntarily discharged after 1 March 1985 before completing initial active duty
      for training (unsatisfactory performance or misconduct), will forfeit accrued leave at separation.
         29.1.5.1. Do not submit C11 for leave payment if the member is discharged for any of the reasons
         listed in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 350101d.
         29.1.5.2. This does not apply to those members who successfully complete IADT in less than 6
         months or those being released early for reasons other than those listed in the DoDFMR, Volume
         7A, paragraph 350101d.
      29.1.6. Use of Leave.
         29.1.6.1. A member may use leave accrued during each active duty tour. Leave may not be taken
         after the tour has been completed.
             29.1.6.1.1. Example: Active duty tour from 2 March through 30 April. Leave must be taken
             before 1 May.
         29.1.6.2. The supervisor of the unit at which member performs the active duty tour, either in a
         temporary duty (TDY) or permanent change of station (PCS) status, may grant use of accrued
         leave.
         29.1.6.3. When a member uses leave, the member is entitled to the same pay and allowances for
         the used days as a member on extended active duty. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph
         030104.
         29.1.6.4. Advanced/Excess Leave. In emergencies, or for non-prior-service enlistees while
         attending courses of instruction during the Christmas holiday recess, the commander may grant
         leave limited to the number of days which will accrue during the entire tour of active duty stated
         in orders; this is known as advance leave.
             29.1.6.4.1. If the commander grants more leave than can be accrued during the period of the
             active duty tour, the leave becomes excess leave.
             29.1.6.4.2. The member must be informed that collection will be made from pay and allow-
             ances for the number of excess days of leave plus a penalty of 1/2 day for each 6 days of excess
             leave.
             29.1.6.4.3. Collection should be made from the final payment at the end of the tour. However,
             collections are usually taken from Reserve and Guard pay once the member has returned to the
             unit.
         29.1.6.5. Leave Status when Medically Unfit for Duty.
             29.1.6.5.1. A member on leave, who is hospitalized or under care of a civilian physician, is
             not charged leave if the member is medically unfit for duty.
             29.1.6.5.2. Appropriate safeguards may be established to prevent abuse. However, guidance
             must include accepting certification from civilian authorities in emergency situations. (See
             AFR 35-9, Leave and Administrative Absence Policy, paragraph 1-37, for specific instruc-
             tions on notifications)
             29.1.6.5.3. Chargeable leave ends the day before and starts the day after hospitalization or
             sick in quarters, regardless of the hour of admission or discharge or release from quarters
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          387


   29.1.7. Service Credit.
      29.1.7.1. When a member uses accrued leave, the days of leave used are credited as service days.

            29.2.6.5.4. Using the leave balance, compute the amounts due as if the member was selling
            the leave. Multiply the projected number of days accrued, on the AF Form 1934 as of the end
            of each quarter, by the actual daily rate of base pay to which the member is entitled. Maintain
            cumulative totals by grade, for your payroll office, of:
                29.2.6.5.4.1. the number of members,
                29.2.6.5.4.2. days accrued leave,
                29.2.6.5.4.3. and the total dollar value.
            29.2.6.5.5. Once completed, forward the cumulative totals to your headquarters, ensuring that
            your unit name, location, and point of contact are included in the report.

         29.3.5.1. RC payroll office computes allowable travel time and determines if the rest of the
         elapsed time between two or more duty sites within an active duty tour is:
             29.3.5.1.1. Duty,
             29.3.5.1.2. Leave for delay en route, or
             29.3.5.1.3. Excess travel time which is chargeable as leave.
         29.3.5.2. RC payroll offices consider certain conditions in computing allowable travel time and in
         charging leave for excess travel time. These conditions are explained in DoDFMR, Volume 7A,
         table 1-2-4, and 29.4.1. “Leave Charges” of this manual.

         29.3.6.1. Tour Less than 30 Days. To compute allowable travel time for active duty tour less than
         30 days see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1, table 1-2-4 and consider the following additional
         conditions:
             29.3.6.1.1. Member Does Not Accrue Leave on this Tour: If the member uses excess travel
             time in travel status from home to duty site and return home, member is not in a military status,
             so no charge is made to leave. Rather, the member is only paid for the allowable travel time;
             travel dates should be included in active duty order IAW DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph
             10242.
             29.3.6.1.2. Member on Leave During Tour: If the member uses leave within the period of the
             tour, RCMPS-RF payroll office submits a CO3 transaction to collect pay and allowances for
             number of days used.
         29.3.6.2. Tour More than 30 Days. To compute allowable travel time and leave for active duty
         tour more than 30 days see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1, paragraph 10242, and consider the
         following additional conditions:
             29.3.6.2.1. Member Accrues Leave on this Tour: If the member uses excess travel time from
             home to duty site and return home, member is not in a military status, so no charge is made to
             leave. Rather, the member is only paid for the allowable travel time; travel dates should be
             included in active duty order IAW DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 10242.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             393


          29.3.6.2.2. Member on Leave During Tour: If the member uses leave within the period of the
          tour, charge leave. If the member uses more leave than accrued (excess leave), process collec-
          tion according to section 32.9., “DFAS-DE Debt Collection Actions – Debt Type DQ”.
      29.3.6.3. Estimated Travel Time (AFRES/ANG Only). Do not use the estimated travel time
      shown in orders as allowable travel time.
      29.3.6.4. Air Travel Directed in the CONUS. Only one (1) day of travel time is allowable in the
      CONUS under orders directing travel by air unless member furnishes a certificate from the trans-
      portation officer that air transportation is not available.
      29.3.6.5. Delays. When member performs TDY between two active duty sites, any delays (excess
      travel) due to stopover, circuitous travel, return home, etc., which are the result of actions of the
      member are chargeable as leave.
      29.3.6.6. Specific Mode. When a specific mode is directed, and the traveler performs travel by
      that mode, the time used is the allowable travel time. If the specific mode is not available, compute
      travel time as if a specific mode were not ordered.
      29.3.6.7. Early Reporting. When a member reports early at a TDY or PCS site, do not charge
      leave.
      29.3.6.8. Allowable Travel Time. For allowable travel time, use DoDFMR, Volume 7A, para-
      graph 10242 and table 1-2-4.
      29.3.6.9. Portion of a Day. Any portion of a day spent in allowable travel time, actual or construc-
      tive, is a day of travel.
      29.3.6.10. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) – Temporary Duty (TDY) En Route. Compute
      allowable travel time as if each leg of the travel was a separate PCS between:
          29.3.6.10.1. The old duty station or home and the TDY site.
          29.3.6.10.2. The TDY sites.
          29.3.6.10.3. The last TDY site and the new permanent site or home.
      29.3.6.11. Do not charge leave if the member remains at a duty site during elapsed time between
      duty sites. Charge leave for any time away from the duty site if the time exceeds the allowable
      travel time between them.
      29.3.6.12. Mode of Transportation. The type of transportation, e.g., private auto, government
      transportation request, commercial air, authorized or used.
      29.3.6.13. Commuting Distance. The area that the installation commander has determined is rea-
      sonable for members to drive to and from duty on a daily basis.
      29.3.6.14. Entry or Release from Active Duty. Do not charge leave for excess allowable travel
      time used on entry to or release from active duty. For the purpose of active duty pay and allow-
      ances, a member is in a military status only for the day(s) of allowable travel time; he or she is not
      in a military status for the excess travel time.

29.4. Section D – Leave Processing by FSOs.
394                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      29.4.1. Leave Charges. When a member presents the DD Form 1351-2 to the AFO for payment of
      travel allowances, the AFO:
         29.4.1.1. Asks traveler if leave was used in connection with the travel or within the period of the
         active duty tour.
         29.4.1.2. Reviews item I on the travel voucher. If leave was taken or delay en route is chargeable
         as leave, circles item on the paid copy of the voucher and mails voucher to the RC payroll office.
         (See Table 29.3. and Table 29.4. for examples of travel vouchers).
         29.4.1.3. Prepares AF Form 985 if the computation of travel allowances indicates that member
         used leave during the period of the active duty tour. Obtains control number for the form from RC
         payroll office. (See Table 29.3. and Table 29.4. for examples of travel vouchers, and 29.5.7.,
         “Examples for Determining How to Charge Leave”).
         29.4.1.4. Posts payment of travel on DD Form 1588, Record of Travel Payments, per DFAS-DER
         7010-3. When the AF Form 985 is issued, adds notation of that issue on the DD Form 1588.
         29.4.1.5. Distributes the AF Form 985 per paragraph 29.7.

29.5. Payment of Leave.
      29.5.1. Entitlement. A member of the Air Reserve Forces may be paid for unused accrued leave the
      same as members on extended active duty. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 2 and 4.
      29.5.2. Sixty-Day Limitation for Payment.
         29.5.2.1. The number of days accrued leave paid in a military career (regardless of whether the
         career is all active duty, all reserve duty, or a combination thereof) is limited to 60-days maximum
         as of 10 Feb 1976.
         29.5.2.2. The member’s MMPA should include the total number of days accrued unused leave for
         which member has been paid.
         29.5.2.3. The RC payroll office inputs the total number of leave days paid. See procedures in
         29.5.3., “Leave Prior Service Days Paid.”
         29.5.2.4. Leave accrued in excess of the 60-day maximum must be used or it will be lost. (See
         DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 40401 for exceptions due to Persian Gulf conflict.)
      29.5.3. Leave Prior Service Days Paid. The RC payroll office inputs leave data for the member’s
      MMPA upon gain of the member, and determines the “LEAVE FINAL INDICATOR” code (position
      28 of the A06 gain transaction) based on the conditions stated below and the need for subsequent
      actions (see Table 2.6. for the format):
         29.5.3.1. If the gained member has had prior service other than Air Force AD, and the PRIOR
         SERVICE LEAVE SOLD field (positions 30-32) are filled, enter an “X” in the LEAVE FINAL
         INDICATOR field (position 28).
             29.5.3.1.1. Take no further action unless the days leave accrued and days leave paid need
             adjusting.
             29.5.3.1.2. If an adjustment is required, submit an A06 Leave Only transaction to overlay the
             original leave days reported. See Table 29.10. for the A06 Leave Only format.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          395


      29.5.3.2. If the member is a non-prior-service airman or officer, enter an “X” in the LEAVE
      FINAL INDICATOR field (position 28). Zero-fill the PRIOR SERVICE LEAVE SOLD field in
      the A06 leave only transaction. Take no further action unless an adjustment is required. See Table
      29.10. for A06 Leave Only format.
      29.5.3.3. When the prior service type and total number of days of accrued unused leave paid after
      9 Feb 1976 are not known, leave a space in the LEAVE FINAL INDICATOR field (position 28)
      and zero-fill the PRIOR SERVICE LEAVE SOLD field (positions 30-32). See Table 29.10. the
      A06 Leave Only format.
      29.5.3.4. As long as the leave final indicator in the MMPA is a space:
          29.5.3.4.1. DJMS-RC, on the code 3 (end-of-month) computer runs, generates the message
          “PRIOR-SERVICE LEAVE DAYS PAID INCOMPLETE” on the JUMPS-RF action
          items-CBPO, UH022-164. The message continues to print until the RC payroll office inputs
          the leave data with an A06 Leave Only transaction (see Table 29.10.) to report leave paid and
          post the final leave indicator.
          29.5.3.4.2. The C11 transaction for payment of accrued unused leave rejects if the LEAVE
          FINAL INDICATOR field (position 28) is not an “X”.
      29.5.3.5. If the member gained has had prior service with the Air Force or any other service, but
      was separated before 10 Feb 1976, report “X” in the LEAVE FINAL INDICATOR field (position
      28) and zeros in the PRIOR SERVICE LEAVE SOLD field (positions 30-32). Take no further
      action unless an adjustment is required. (See Table 29.10. for the A06 Leave Only transaction.)
   29.5.4. Leave Only A06 Transaction. The RC payroll office prepares A06 Leave Only (see Table
   29.10.).
      29.5.4.1. To overlay the total number of leave days paid after 9 February 1976.
NOTE: Special care must be used to include ALL leave paid.
      29.5.4.2. To change the LEAVE FINAL INDICATOR field (position 28) from a space to an “X”.
   29.5.5. Payment of Accrued Unused Leave. The RC payroll office is responsible for maintaining a
   member’s leave information. This is to include leave earned while member was in a CZ or QHDA.
   The UH022-777, Combat Zone Tax/Wage Exemption Report, can be a useful tool in maintaining each
   member’s CZ leave balance. Reference Chapter 30, Section H, paragraph 30.8.
      29.5.5.1. The RC payroll office:
          29.5.5.1.1. Prepares a C11 transaction (see Table 29.11. for the transaction format).
          29.5.5.1.2. Posts the number of days and half-days leave accrual, and leave days taken, by
          each FY, as input on the C11, on the AF Form 1934. If the tour end date is outside IAS, the C11
          will reject to DFAS-DE/FJPR on the UH022-116 report.
          29.5.5.1.3. Posts the number of days (earned and taken) input in the C11 transaction, and date
          of input, on the AF Form 1934. Number of days of leave being sold is computed.
          29.5.5.1.4. Any days of leave being sold, that were earned while member was in a CZ or
          QHDA, are tax exempt. DJMS currently only recognizes the month in which the tour ends for
          tax exclusion of leave if member was in a CZ or QHDA during that month. Reference para-
396                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            graph 30.9., “Leave Earned in a Combat Zone (CZ) or Qualified Hazardous Duty Area
            (QHDA)”.
            29.5.5.1.5. Closes AF Form 1934 and files with attached documents in the DJMS-RC support-
            ing documents file with copy of the input listing.
      29.5.6. Leave Adjustment Actions.
         29.5.6.1. RC Payroll Office.
            29.5.6.1.1. For adjustments to previous payments of accrued leave, RC payroll office submits
            a DD Form 114 to DFAS-DE/FJPA supported by the AF Form 1934.
            29.5.6.1.2. Dates shown on the DD Form 114 must be inclusive and must include all entitle-
            ments due when paying accrued leave.
            29.5.6.1.3. When a C03 transaction is processed to collect a day of active duty and that day
            was used as the tour end date in the C11 transaction, the C03 will reject to DFAS-DE/FJPA for
            removal of the leave data from the pay history file entry. See Table 32.3. for the C03 format.
         29.5.6.2. DFAS-DE/FJPA.
            29.5.6.2.1. Adjustments Inside IAS. Inputs DQ03 and D17 transactions for collection of erro-
            neous payment, and notifies the RC payroll office to input the C11 transaction to pay accrued
            leave correctly. See Table 32.7., Table 43.28., and Table 29.11., respectively, for the DQ03,
            D17, and C11 formats.
            29.5.6.2.2. Adjustments Outside IAS. Processes DQ03 transaction for collection and pro-
            cesses D17 transaction for accrued leave adjustment. See Table 32.7. and Table 43.28.,
            respectively, for the DQ03 and D17 formats.
            29.5.6.2.3. Adjusting Tour End Dates. When a C03 transaction is input to collect an active
            duty day that was used as the tour end date in the C11 transaction, DFAS-DE/FJPA must input
            DQ03 and D17 transactions to collect the accrued leave before the C03 can be reinput to col-
            lect the active duty pay and allowances. See Table 32.3., Table 29.11., Table 32.7., and Table
            43.28., respectively, for the C03, C11, DQ03, and D17 formats.
            29.5.6.2.4. DFAS-DE/FJPA then notifies the RC payroll office to input another C11 transac-
            tion to pay the correct accrued leave amount.
      29.5.7. Examples for Determining How to Charge Leave. Using a normal work schedule of Monday
      through Friday, 0730 to 1630.
         29.5.7.1. If the member departs the local area (or signs up for space-available travel) on Tuesday,
         and if the leave approving authority determines that the majority (over 50 percent) of the sched-
         uled duty was performed, Tuesday is a day of duty and Wednesday is the first day of leave.
         29.5.7.2. If the member departs the local area (or signs up for space-available travel) on Saturday,
         regardless of the hour, that day is a day of duty and Sunday is the first day of leave.
         29.5.7.3. If departure from the local area is on Sunday, regardless of the hour, that day is a day of
         duty and Monday is the first day of leave. This also applies if the member signs up for space-avail-
         able transportation on Sunday.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                        397


     29.5.7.4. If the member returns from leave on Friday, and if the leave approving authority deter-
     mines that the majority (over 50 percent) of scheduled duty was performed, Friday is a day of duty
     and Thursday is the last day of leave.
     29.5.7.5. If the member returns from leave on Saturday, regardless of the hour, Saturday is a day
     of leave. This rule also applies if return is on Sunday. (The above examples use Monday through
     Friday as normally scheduled workdays; however, for members on shift work, equivalent sched-
     ules will be arranged though the days of the week vary.)

      30.1.2. Federal Taxable Wages. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, table 7-1-1, to determine what entitle-
      ments are subject to federal taxation. Taxable wages are reported (and taxes withheld) in the year
      wages are paid (based on the check date). Federal and state taxable wages are reduced when debts for
      overpayments of taxable wages are collected, if the overpayment is collected in the same year it was
      made.
         30.1.2.1. Income Tax Returns. It is the policy of the federal government that members are respon-
         sible for filing federal and state income tax returns and for paying their taxes. Commanders should
         advise members of this policy. Refer members to the base legal office for guidance on filing tax
         returns.

  30.1.3. Social Security Numbers (SSNs).
     30.1.3.1. Requirement.
         30.1.3.1.1. Each member on DJMS-RC is responsible for obtaining a Social Security Number
         (SSN) for crediting FICA wages for social security coverage and for identification (see AFI
         36-3203). This number is the member’s service identification number.
         30.1.3.1.2. For a change in name, the member submits OAAN 7003, Request for Change in
         Social Security Record, to the Social Security Administration (SSA) district office nearest the
         member’s home.
         30.1.3.1.3. The Payroll office (PO) ensures changes in name and SSN are submitted through
         PDS upon receipt of documents from member and notification is received in the PO of actions
         pending.
         30.1.3.1.4. For Active Air Guard Reserve, see Chapter 24, “Payments by DJMS-AC” and
         Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS” for JUMPS/JSS-AC

     istration Field Office, 34 South West First Street, Miami, FL 33130, unless a social security field
     office has been established in this particular area.
  30.1.5. TD Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. When a member first reports
  for duty or whenever a member’s tax status changes, the member submits a TD Form W-4. Informa-
  tion reflected in the TD Form W-4 is used to establish or change FITW or SITW data and deduction
  factors on a member’s Master Military Pay Account (MMPA). Submit an A06 transaction (see Table
  2.6.) to establish state of legal residence. To change state of legal residence, submit an A17 transaction
  (see Table 30.2.).
     30.1.5.1. Change in Marital Status or Number of Allowances. When a member submits a TD
     Form W-4 to change marital status or the number of allowances, determine what data must be
     changed by looking at the member’s MMPA or current LES.
         30.1.5.1.1. If the member is now claiming a different marital status, input an A17 transaction
         to update the MMPA. (See Table 30.2.)
         30.1.5.1.2. If the member changes the number of allowances, input an A17 transaction (see
         Table 30.2.).
414                                                              AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      30.1.5.2. Additional Withholding. When a member submits a TD Form W4 to start, stop, or
      change an additional FITW or SITW amount, input an A17 transaction. (See Table 30.2.)
         30.1.5.2.1. Members may increase the amount withheld by adding the number of options to
         the TD Form W-4 at the rate of $1.00 per day but not more than 84 options (84 x $1.00 =
         $84.00 per day).
         30.1.5.2.2. Member must indicate 0 (zero) exemptions on the TD Form W-4 in order to claim
         additional amounts (26 U.S.C. 3402(a)).
         30.1.5.2.3. To stop the additional FITW or STIW amount, input the A17 transaction and
         zero-fill additional options. (See Table 30.2.)
      30.1.5.3. Exemption from Withholding. When a member submits a TD Form W-4 claiming
      exemption from withholding, advise the member that there must have been no tax liability in the
      previous year and the member anticipates none in the current year.
         30.1.5.3.1. A TD Form W-4 for exemption from withholding is only valid for the calendar
         year in which it is submitted. If a member wants to continue the exempt status in the next year,
         a new TD Form W-4 must be submitted by 15 February of the next calendar year.
         30.1.5.3.2. If, during the year, a member determines that there will not be a tax liability in the
         current year, a new TD Form W-4 claiming a valid election and number of exemptions must be
         submitted.
         30.1.5.3.3. If the member determines that there will be a tax liability in the next year, a new
         TD Form W-4 must be submitted by 1 December of the current year to be effective on 1 Janu-
         ary of the new year.
         30.1.5.3.4. To exempt member’s wages, process an A17 transaction with a value of “80” in
         the ‘FITW Exemption’ field (CP 17-18). See Table 30.2. for A17 format.
      30.1.5.4. Submission of TD Forms W-4 to IRS. DFAS-DE is required to submit TD Forms W-4
      data to the IRS when:
         30.1.5.4.1. The employee claims more than 10 withholding allowances, or
         30.1.5.4.2. The employee claims total exemption from withholding due to no tax liability.
      30.1.5.5. RC Payroll Office Responsibilities for TD Forms W-4. The payroll office must honor a
      member’s TD Form W-4 submission, unless the IRS gives written notification specifically stating
      that a member is not entitled to claim exempt status or is not entitled to the number of withholding
      allowances claimed on the TD Form W4. However, if the number of allowances claimed on the
      member’s TD Form W-4 is greater than ‘10’, exempt from FITW and/or SITW, enter an exempt
      reason code in CP 39. See Table 30.2. for A17 format. When written notice is received from IRS,
      the payroll office must comply with the IRS determination letter effective with the processing
      month of receipt.
         30.1.5.5.1. The payroll office should forward the original IRS determination letter, after pro-
         cessing of non-exempt or reduced withholding allowances has been completed, to DFAS-DE;
         retain a duplicate copy; and send a duplicate copy to the member.
         30.1.5.5.2. If, after the receipt of the determination letter, the member brings in a new deter-
         mination letter (with a more recent date) authorizing him or her a larger number of exemptions
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          415


          or an exempt status, the payroll office must honor the new determination if the member’s does
          not claim from withholding, or the number of withholding allowances is consistent with the
          IRS letter.
          30.1.5.5.3. No refunds are to be given to the member for the period of the lower exemption or
          nonexempt status.
          30.1.5.5.4. The payroll office should submit an A17 transaction to process the TD Form W-4.

          decreased) by DFAS-DE only when wages were previously reported incorrectly to IRS on the
          TD Form W2.
          30.2.1.2.2. DFAS-DE/FJPR will issue a TD Form W-2c, Statement of Corrected Income and
          Tax Amounts, based on the Employer Identification Number (84-9980000).
   30.2.2. FITW Withholding Rates. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1, for additional guidance.
      30.2.2.1. To Correct/Adjust FITW Wages.
          30.2.2.1.1. Current Year: Correction or adjustment requests for current year should be directed

   ing rate published by the IRS in the IRS FITW Daily/Miscellaneous Table.

30.3. Section C – Social Security (FICA) and Medicare Withholding.
   30.3.1. Social Security and Medicare Taxable Wages. Between 1 January 1957 to 31 December 1990,
   FICA wages and withholdings were deducted and reported as one amount. Beginning in January
   1991, the IRS required FICA to be separately deducted and reported as Social Security and Medicare.
   See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 2. Only basic pay is subject to Social Security and Medicare tax-
   ation and withholding. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 70203f, to calculate Social Security and
   Medicare taxable wages.
      30.3.1.1. To Correct/Adjust FICA.
416                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007

             30.3.1.1.2. Prior Year. A member’s prior year Social Security or Medicare wage may only be
             corrected by DFAS-DE if a DFAS-DE system or administrative error resulted in incorrect
             reporting of withholdings on the TD Form W-2 and/or MMPA.
         30.3.1.2. In such situations, payroll offices must notify DFAS-DE/FJPR and request a TD Form
         W-2c be issued. However, DFAS-DE can only refund up to three prior year’s withholdings and
         only when the withholding was originally over collected. SSA prohibits refunds after 3 years.
         30.3.1.3. Employee Wage Record. Members may request a copy of their wage record for Social
         Security and Medicare purposes by contacting a local SSA office. Members stationed overseas
         should address their requests to:
                  Social Security Administration
                  PO Box 57
                  Baltimore, MD 21203

30.4. Section D – State Income Tax Withholding (SITW)/Wages.
      30.4.1. State Taxable Wages. Items of pay that are subject to state taxation if they are subject to fed-
      eral taxation.

             DFAS-DE/FJPR only when the wages were previously reported incorrectly on the TD Form
             W-2. DFAS-DE will issue a TD Form W-2c.
      30.4.2. Actions that Affect SITW Computations.
         30.4.2.1. Declare or Change State of Legal Residency. New members must declare a state of legal
         residence within 6 months of accession using DD Form 2058, State of Legal Residence Certifi-
         cate. Members changing state of legal residence must execute a DD Form 2058, in triplicate.
             30.4.2.1.1. The original is submitted to the payroll office;
             30.4.2.1.2. The second copy is provided to the member for his/her records;
             30.4.2.1.3. The third copy is retained at the payroll office until it is disposed of in accordance
             with AFMAN 37-139; and
             30.4.2.1.4. The effective date of the change in legal residence is the processing date of either
             the A06 or A17 transaction (See Table 2.6. for the A06 transaction and Table 30.2. for the
             A17 transaction).

         that grant exemption based on specific residency requirements can claim exemption using either
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            417


      the TD Form W-4, DD Form 2058-1, or a specific state form designated by the state to be used to
      authorize exemption.
      30.4.2.3. States with Non-Residency Requirements. The following states have unique require-
      ments which affect military members who are legal residents. An active duty member from Cali-
      fornia, Connecticut, Idaho, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, or Vermont
      may claim exemption because of non-residency. If a member performs active duty at a location
      outside of his/her state of legal residence, and his/her abode has been outside of the state of legal
      residence, current military pay earned may be exempted from SITW. Process an A17 transaction
      with a value of ‘80’ in the ‘SITW Exemption’ field and a ‘1’ in the ‘SITW Exempt Reason’ field
      (CP 39). See Table 30.2. for the A17 format.
      30.4.2.4. Change of Marital Status and Number of Allowances. Submit an A17 transaction to
      change both federal and state exemptions and status (see Table 30.2.).
   30.4.3. SITW Withholding Rates.
      30.4.3.1. State income taxes are withheld from the pay of those members whose state(s) of legal
      residence have formalized agreements with the United States Department of Treasury for state
      income tax withholding (SITW). The amount of SITW deduction must approximate the withhold-
      ing requirements designated by state law.
      30.4.3.2. Items pay are subject to SITW if they are subject to FITW.
      30.4.3.3. DFAS-DE has no authority to collect delinquent state taxes from a member’s pay. Once
      a member changes their state of legal residence, SITW cannot be refunded for the prior state.
      SITW cannot be collected for prior tax years.
      30.4.3.4. Prior year SITW deductions cannot be refunded to the member by DFAS-DE under any
      circumstances. The member must contact the state to obtain any prior year SITW refunds.

30.5. Section E – TD Form W-2.
   30.5.1. Deficiencies in Tax Accounts. If a member knows there is a deficiency in their tax account, or
   is notified in person by a local IRS agent that there is a deficiency, the member should try to resolve
   matter at once so that a levy may be avoided. The member may seek advice from legal authorities.
   30.5.2. TD Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.
      30.5.2.1. General.
          30.5.2.1.1. DFAS-DE/FJR produces TD Form W-2s for all members who were paid by
          DJMS-RC during the calendar year, including members who separated and retired during the
          year.
          30.5.2.1.2. The TD Form W-2 is produced and mailed each January following the calendar
          (tax) year (i.e., the 1992 TD Form W-2 is produced and mailed to members in January 1993).
          30.5.2.1.3. TD Forms W-2 will reflect the entire calendar year taxable wages and withhold-
          ings, even if the member had a break in service during the year.
      30.5.2.2. Pension Plan.
          30.5.2.2.1. Per Title 26 U.S.C. 219(g)(5)(A)(iii) and (6)(A), Guard and Reserve members who
          complete more than 90 days active duty time during a calendar year are considered to be cov-
418                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            ered under a qualified pension plan and block 15 of the TD Form W-2 should be marked.
            Active duty days do not include training days. Currently, DJMS-RC does not differentiate
            between what is an actual training day and what is an active duty day. Therefore, TD forms
            W-2 issued from DJMS-RC will not have block 15 marked.
            30.5.2.2.2. Guard and reserve members who served an extended active duty tour (90 days or
            more) during the calendar year, and were paid by DJMS-AC, will receive a TD Form W-2 with
            block 15 marked.
         30.5.2.3. Duplicate TD Forms W-2. Requests for duplicate (reissue) TD Form W-2 may be pro-
         cessed by any payroll office via the 5-Year Tax History System. Request can be for local printing
         (if capability exists) or central site printing. Refer to the “5-Year Tax History Users’ Guide” (a
         separate manual) for information on use of the 5-Year Tax History System.
         30.5.2.4. TD Forms W-2c, Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts. Payroll offices do
         not issue corrected TD Form W-2s for members.
            30.5.2.4.1. The payroll office notifies DFAS-DE/FJPA (if original W-2 EIN is 84-9990000) to
            correct W-2s issued by JUMPS (active duty system), or DFAS-DE/FJPR (if original W-2 EIN
            is 84-9980000) to correct W-2s issued by DJMS-RC, and requests a TD Form W-2C for TD
            Forms W-2 believed to be in error. NOTE: Since a Reserve or Guard member could be paid by
            the DJMS-AC (the active pay system) (EIN is 84-9990000) and DJMS-RC (the reserve pay
            system) (EIN is 84-9980000), it is important to specify the TD Form W-2 that is in question,
            and give the EIN.
            30.5.2.4.2. Include, SSN, name, address, phone number, and reason the TD Form W-2 may be
            in error.
            30.5.2.4.3. Provide backup documents, if necessary.
            30.5.2.4.4. The member should sign the request and mail to: DFAS-DE/FJPA (Active Duty
            Pay System for EIN 84-9990000) or DFAS-DE/FJPR (Reserve Pay System for EIN
            84-9980000), 6760 East Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-3000.
            30.5.2.4.5. DFAS-DE/FJPR will complete a DJMS-RC request for manual TD Form W2c and
            forward it to DFAS-DE/FJFAB. This must be accomplished manually for all tax years, as there
            is no programmatic interface between DJMS-RC and the 5-Year Tax History System.
            DFAS-DE/FJFAB will update the five-year tax history which will generate a TD Form W2c to
            be mailed to the member.

30.6. Section F – Notice of Levy, TD Form 668-W.
      30.6.1. IRS Form 668-W, Notice of Levy
         30.6.1.1. Authority. The Treasury Department issues a TD Form 668-W, Notice of Levy on
         Wages, Salary and Other Income, against members for income tax due and for which the IRS is
         unable to make collection (see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1).
         30.6.1.2. Internal Revenue Service. The IRS must serve the TD Form 668-W on DFAS-DE/FJPG.
         If IRS presents a TD Form 668-W to the unit of assignment, the unit returns the notice to IRS with
         information to serve the notice on DFAS-DE/FJPG.
         30.6.1.3. DFAS-DE/FJPG Procedures for TD Form 668-W Actions.

          IRS. Prepares interoffice memo to DFAS-DE/FJFA.

30.7. Section G – Earned Income Credit (EIC).
   30.7.1. General. EIC is a special credit for certain persons who work. The credit reduces the amount
   of tax a person owes (if any), and is intended to offset some of the increases in living expenses and
   social security taxes. A military member on extended active duty outside the United States is consid-
   ered to live in the United States during that duty period. Extended active duty means the member was
   called or ordered to duty for an indefinite period, or for a period of more than 90 days. Once members
   begin serving the extended active duty, they are still considered to have been on extended active duty
   even if they serve less than 90 days.
   30.7.2. Entitlement Criteria. EIC is available to individuals whose earned income, and adjusted gross
   income, are below the thresholds as established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The earned
   income, and adjusted gross income, threshold varies depending on whether the member has one qual-
   ifying child, two or more qualifying children, or no qualifying child. Member should refer to IRS Pub-
   lication 596 for further information.
   30.7.3. Earned Income. The term earned income includes all taxable items of pay as well as any
   non-taxable earned income (NTEI).
      30.7.3.1. NTEI for military members includes basic allowance for quarters (BAQ), basic allow-
      ance for subsistence (BAS), ROTC subsistence, and wages that are excluded by the combat zone
      tax exclusion (CZTE).
      30.7.3.2. The actual cash value paid for BAQ, BAS, and ROTC subsistence is included in NTEI
      unless the member is provided housing and/or meals. An imputed in-kind value is included for
      these members.
      30.7.3.3. NTEI amounts are maintained on the member’s MMPA, tax deduction data screen,
      under the area EIC amounts. Amounts are updated on a monthly basis. The total of all NTEI
      amounts is provided to the member on the TD Form W-2, wage and tax statement, in block 13
      along with code Q.
   30.7.4. Advanced Payment of Earned Income Credit (APEIC). The current Defense Joint Military
   Pay System – Reserve Component does not have the capability to provide APEIC payments to mem-
   bers.

30.8. Section H – Combat Zone Exclusion. Some members may be qualified for the combat zone tax
exclusion because of direct support of military operations in a combat zone. Refer to DoDFMR, Volume.
7A, paragraph 70103, for entitlement determination information.
      30.8.1. Input an A90 transaction (see Table 30.3.) for members that were or currently are paid by
      DJMS-RC and are qualified for the combat zone tax exclusion. Combat zone country code input will
      be edited against DJMS-AC Table 154. Access to view or print this table can be accomplished via
      transaction ID ‘JWMM’ on DJMS-AC.
      30.8.2. The A90 transaction will be used to collect data in DJMS-RC and to determine the tax and
      wage exclusion amounts. Applicable tax refunds will be issued on the first Code 1 after the Code 3
      pay updates. Applicable wages will be excluded on the W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.
      30.8.3. Information required on the A90:
      30.8.4. Use the actual combat zone codes. If a member was not in the combat zone, but qualifies
      under “direct support of military operations,” and was approved, use the combat zone he/she was sup-
      porting.
      30.8.5. Do not use any future date in the A90 transaction.
      30.8.6. The A90 transaction start date and stop date must be in the same calendar year.
      30.8.7. Limit the A90 stop date to the current pay run date. If the member is in the combat zone from
      1 April through 20 May (and it is now April), submit one A90 for the month of April. Wait until May
      to submit an A90 for 1 May through 20 May.
      30.8.8. The UH022-777, Combat Zone Tax/Wage Exemption Report, in microfiche, is produced on
      the Code 3 update. This report provides the monthly wage exemption and tax refund (if applicable)
      data. The payroll office should reconcile this report monthly.

30.9. Leave Earned in a Combat Zone (CZ) or Qualified Hazardous Duty Area (QHDA).
      30.9.1. The value of leave earned while member is on active duty in a CZ, or QHDA, is excludable
      from wages when sold. For officers, the value of leave that may be excluded is limited to the maxi-
      mum enlisted amount for the month of service to which the leave was earned, less the amount of reg-
      ular wages already excluded for that month. The term maximum enlisted amount refers to the highest
      amount payable to the highest enlisted grade, plus imminent danger pay if entitled. For enlisted and
      warrant officer grades, there is no limit to the exclusion amount.
      30.9.2. When a C1 transaction processed for leave sold or used, and the C11 end date is equal to or
      falls within the same month as the A90 transaction end date, the system will compute CZTE based on
      the start and stop date of the A90 transaction. For example, if a member was in a CZ from January 1
      through January 30 and C11 was processed for 2.5 days of leave sold or used, system would compute
      CZTE for 2.5 days. However, if member was in a CZ from October 1 through November 12 and C11
      is processed in November for 3.5 days of sold or used leave, system would compute CZTE for 1 day.
      This is due to the fact that the A90 transaction for the month of November contains start and stop
      dated of November 1 and November 12. These dates equate to 1 day of earned leave while in a CZ
      when the member was entitled to 3.5 days leave. In a case such as this, the RPO submits and MPO to
      DFAS-DE/FJPR to adjust taxable income. See Figure 30.2. for a sample MPO.

      31.1.4.5. Submits an A27 transaction when the member wishes to change the amount of coverage
      (see Table 31.3.). The change is effective upon receipt of the VASGLV8286 at the personnel
      office.
      31.1.4.6. See Chapter 10, “ANG and USAFR Non-Prior Service Members” for special instruc-
      tions for non-prior-service enlistees.
   31.1.5. SGLI Refunds.
      31.1.5.1. Description. This section provides procedures for making SGLI refunds for previously
      collected SGLI premiums.
      31.1.5.2. Substantiating Documents. SGLI election is made on SGLV-8286, Servicemember’s
      Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate. SGLI refunds are initiated on a Department of
      Defense (DD) Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, or a DD Form 114, Military Pay Order,
      based on either a declination of insurance coverage or reduced coverage election.
428                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      31.1.5.3. Responsibilities. The SGLV-8286 is maintained at the military personnel flight (MPF) in
      the member’s personnel record. When a refund is necessary, the member’s reserve payroll office
      (RPO) initiates the source document, normally a DD Form 139, for the refund.
      31.1.5.4. Unit Procedures.
         31.1.5.4.1. Upon receipt of a SGLV-8286, MPF personnel must ensure the member’s pay
         record is updated with the correct information. Therefore, the MPF sends the SGLI form to the
         RPO to update the member’s pay record.
         31.1.5.4.2. RPOs should advise Air Force Guard and Reserve members to check their leave
         and earnings statements’ deduction for SGLI with the amount that corresponds to the election
         on the SGLV-8286.
      31.1.5.5. Pay Status Change.
         31.1.5.5.1. If a reserve member’s status changes, for example, from a ‘non-pay’ status to
         active duty, do not prepare a DD Form 139 to refund previously collected SGLI. NOTE: This
         pay status change will not apply to guard members.
         31.1.5.5.2. Input a D18 memo entry (see Table 43.28. for the D18 format) on the member’s
         pay record which states that the member’s “SGLI premium is paid through (date)”. Based on
         the ‘paid through date’, suspense an A27 (see Table 31.3. for the A27 format) for future input.
         31.1.5.5.3. Input the A27 for the appropriate option, effective the month after the previously
         paid period had expired.
      31.1.5.6. Election Change.
         31.1.5.6.1. Effective date for reduced coverage. When a member has elected reduced cover-
         age after entry into the service, the effective date of coverage is the first day of the month fol-
         lowing receipt by the uniformed service, and the SGLI deduction starts in the reduced amount
         the first day of the month following receipt of the member’s election. If the member has
         changed the amount of SGLI coverage, process the A27 (see Table 31.3. for the A27 format)
         effective the first full month following the date of the election.
         31.1.5.6.2. Effective date for declined coverage. When a member has declined or canceled
         SGLI coverage after entry into the service, the effective date of termination is the first day of
         the month following receipt by the uniformed service and the SGLI deduction stops at the end
         of the month in which the member’s election is received by the service. If the member has
         declined SGLI coverage, process and A27 (see Table 31.3. for the A27 format) effective the
         first full month following the date of the election.
         31.1.5.6.3. Effective date of refunds. Refunds are not made for a period that is before the
         effective date of the election for reduced or declined coverage. If, for example, the effective
         date of the reduced coverage election change is May 6, 1996, the reduced coverage should
         begin June 1996. If this change did not reflect in the pay system until July, the member would
         be due a refund for June.
      31.1.5.7. DD Form 139 Preparation.
         31.1.5.7.1. The RPO will prepare a DD Form 139 or a DD Form 114, as appropriate, to initiate
         a refund for the incorrect SGLI withholding. The RPO will process the refund using a D02,
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           429


           with the Z5 as the component of pay code, as provided in 31.1.5.8., Transaction Processing 1.
           Input a D18 memo entry explaining the reason for the refund.
           31.1.5.7.2. Complete every block of the DD Form 139. The G.A.O. exception block will
           reflect “N/A”. The explanation/reason for adjustment block must reflect the following infor-
           mation:

           31.1.5.7.3. Accounting Classification
              31.1.5.7.3.1. If the refund is for Air Force SGLI that was collected as an accounts receiv-
              able DV debt, established as a result of non-performance of duty, the accounting classifica-
              tion will be one of the following:
Air Force Reserves – 57*3700 50* 6272 721.20 S380100         SGLI/Officers and Enlisted APC: ZZZ120
Air National Guard – 57*3850 56* 4156 543.63 S380100         SGLI/Officers and Enlisted APC: ZZC063
NOTE: * will be the appropriate fiscal year.
              31.1.5.7.3.2. If the refund is for prepaid SGLI (for a member in a non-pay status) and a
              refund must be made instead of suspensing the A27, the Air Force accounting classifica-
              tion for the refund is: 57X6434.0005 S380100 (APC: ZZ5SGL).
       31.1.5.8. DFAS Central Site Procedures. In the event the RPO is unable to process the DD Form
       139, then DFAS Central Site will process. When the DD Form 139 and SGLV-8286 are received
       from the member’s unit, ensure each form is complete, correct, and reflects the correct accounting
       classification. See paragraph 31.1.5.7.C.
           31.1.5.8.1. Source document audit. The SGLV-8286 must pass the following checks:
              31.1.5.8.1.1. The member’s and witness’ signatures must be present.
430                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


                 31.1.5.8.1.2. The date the member and the witness signed the form must be the same date.
                 The witness date cannot be prior to or after the date the member signs the form.
         31.1.5.9. Transaction processing.
             31.1.5.9.1. Input a D02 (see Table 43.11. for the D02 format) to generate an SGLI refund. Use
             the APCs referenced in paragraph 31.1.5.7.C for Air Force transactions. The component of
             pay code for SGLI is Z5.
             31.1.5.9.2. Input a D18 memo entry (see Table 43.29. for the D18 format) explaining the rea-
             son for the refund.

31.2. ANG State Sponsored Group Life Insurance (SSLI).
      31.2.1. Authority.
         31.2.1.1. 37 U.S.C. 707, amended by Public Law 93-289, 24 May 1974, provides for a deduction
         from the pay of ANG members for the payment of a premium under a group life insurance pro-
         gram under certain conditions.
         31.2.1.2. The program must be sponsored by the military department of the state in which the
         member holds ANG membership or by the National Guard Association of such state if the state or
         association concerned is approved for providing such payments.
      31.2.2. Procedures.
         31.2.2.1. Member. Prepares and signs AF Form 1548, Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change an
         Allotment, for Active Duty or Retired Personnel, in three copies, to support the deductions for the
         state-sponsored group life insurance (see Table 31.1. for preparation instructions for the AF Form
         1548 and Figure 31.1. on an example of the form).
         31.2.2.2. Distribution of AF Form 1548.
             31.2.2.2.1. Original – member’s SDF.
             31.2.2.2.2. Second copy – state National Guard association.
             31.2.2.2.3. Third copy – member.
      31.2.3. Deduction Limitations.
         31.2.3.1. Only one deduction per month is permitted for any one member.
         31.2.3.2. Only one rate of deduction can apply per month to any one member. Any change in the
         amount of deduction requires the completion of a new AF Form 1548 by the member. DJMS-RC
         deducts the prior amount until the effective date of the new amount is reached.
         31.2.3.3. Only monthly deductions are authorized. Partial months are not deducted.
         31.2.3.4. Deductions from pay are started in the month after the authorization date on the AF
         Form 1548. DJMS-RC makes deductions whenever a member earns enough pay, and processes
         deductions for the current and prior months up to a maximum of 4 months. Deductions start with
         the earliest month in arrears.
         31.2.3.5. If, after 4 consecutive months, pay is not sufficient to deduct the current month and prior
         months for which no deduction was made, the allotment automatically stops. The allotment may

      be reinstated only by initiation of a new AF Form 1548 by the member and submission of a new
      A42 by the RC payroll office (see Table 31.4.).
      31.2.3.6. If a member is in arrears, DJMS-RC makes deductions starting with the earliest month
      not deducted or the effective date of the earliest rate, to the state.
      31.2.3.7. The first deduction SSLI for the non-prior-service member is made upon completion of
      the initial basic military training period and at the beginning of basic technical training, or
      on-the-job-training, when member’s pay status is changed from “V” to “W”. See Table 9.1. for
      definitions of pay status codes.
   31.2.4. RC Payroll Office. Submits the A42 transaction (see Table 31.4.) to start, change, or stop
   insurance deductions based on AF Form 1548.
   31.2.5. Adjustments. The DJMS-RC system does not make refunds of SSLI. Adjustments requiring a
   monetary refund to the member or the state National Guard association are resolved between those
   two parties.
   31.2.6. SSLI User’s Guide. A user’s guide to the State Sponsored Life Insurance (SSLI) system is
   available from DFAS-PMJRC/DE, DSN 926-6143.

31.3. Family SGLI. Public Law 107-14 provided for the establishment of the Family SGLI program,
effective November 1, 2001.
   31.3.1. Description. The Family SGLI program provides coverage for the spouse and all children of
   members having SGLI coverage. Every member who has a SGLI option of other than zero (0), will
   automatically receive coverage under the new program for his/her spouse and children unless the
   member declines coverage using VA Form 8286A. The spouse’s deduction will be automatically
   started at the $100,000 coverage level (Exception – the spouse’s coverage level cannot exceed the
   member’s coverage level. For example, if a member had elected coverage of $80,000 for himself then
   the spouse’s coverage would be limited to $80,000.) Children will be covered at $10,000 level, but
   there is no premium charged for the children’s coverage.
   31.3.2. Source of Input. The automatic deduction will be started in DJMS based upon input received
   from DEERS. The member’s MPF is responsible for maintaining the SGLI documentation and pro-
   viding that information to DEERS.
   31.3.3. Pay Status. The same rules apply as for servicemember’s SGLI.

                                                 Chapter 32

                           ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – DEBT ACCOUNTS

32.1. Authority. A member’s pay may be withheld because of an overpayment or erroneous payment of
pay and allowances. Either DFAS-DE or the RC payroll office may identify the debt. Also, a member’s
pay is subject to deduction for other than pay and allowance debts. For deduction information, see DoD-
FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 7. For precedence of deductions, see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 9.

32.2. General Information.
      32.2.1. The accounts receivable system enables the RC payroll office to record all debts in the
      accounts receivable file, except tax levies, garnishments, and bankruptcies. The RC payroll office may
      also change a deduction type and/or daily rate of deduction.
      32.2.2. DFAS-PMJP/DE makes changes to the status of an accounts receivable record upon receipt of
      a DD Form 114, a message requesting change, or an internal audit. These changes include adjustments
      due to cash collections, suspensions, waivers, erroneous posting of debt amount and cancellation.

32.3. Format Codes.
      32.3.1. The transactions format identification (ID) indicates the type of debt as follows:
         32.3.1.1. DQ – Military Pay and Allowances
         32.3.1.2. DF – Fines, Forfeitures
         32.3.1.3. DG – GPLD, Reports of Survey
         32.3.1.4. DR – For Other Government Agencies (DoD Appropriated Funds other than Pay and
         Allowances.)
         32.3.1.5. DS – All Other (DD Forms 139, non-appropriated fund debts, bad checks, etc.)
         32.3.1.6. DV – Repay Advance Pays, SGLI
         32.3.1.7. DW – Partial Payments
      32.3.2. Transactions are further separated by action indicators:
         32.3.2.1. 03 – New debt
         32.3.2.2. 07 – Adjusts the status of a recorded debt
         32.3.2.3. 09 – Cancels a reported debt. The 09 is for DFAS-DE use only. (See Table 32.21.)

32.4. Accounting Processing Codes (APCs).
      32.4.1. Accounting processing codes (APCs) are used to control systems validations, reporting,
      accounting, and disbursing of collected amounts for DF, DG, DQ, DR, DV, and DW debts. The APCs
      are found on:
         32.4.1.1. Subtable 1 – Air Force Reserve
         32.4.1.2. Subtable 3 – Air National Guard
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           439


      32.4.1.3. Subtable 5 – Army Reserves
      32.4.1.4. Subtable 7 – Army National Guard
      32.4.1.5. Subtable 9 – DG and DR Debts only – All services
      32.4.1.6. Subtable 15 – MPA
      32.4.1.7. Subtable 17 – Navy.
   32.4.2. Example: A member received an advance payment to attend a training school. The training
   was cancelled. A DV debt must now be established. The funds were disbursed using APC M4X3IE.
   The collection must be made against the same accounting information. Therefore, M4X3IE is used for
   the APC on the DV03 collection transaction.
   32.4.3. The system validates an APC if an adjustment is necessary. The same APC used on the 03
   transaction must be used on the 07 or 09 transactions.

32.5. Company Codes.
   32.5.1. Use company codes to control system validations, reporting, accounting, and disbursing of
   collected amounts for DS debts only. The codes are on Table 11. All other debt collections use an
   APC.
   32.5.2. Table 11 is extracted from Table 50 and is used for the for-others debts (format ID DS) that
   require the name and address of an institution in order to disburse monies collected. The table is in
   state, then city sequence and company code; prefix is always D. Example: D001244 for Veterans
   Administration.
   32.5.3. If Table 11 does not contain the appropriate D company code, prepare a letter (original and 1
   copy) to DFAS-PMJFBB1/DE requesting an addition to Table 11 (see Figure 32.1.).
      32.5.3.1. Give the name and complete address of the recipient of the funds.
      32.5.3.2. Leave a space for DFAS-DE to enter the appropriate code.
      32.5.3.3. DFAS-DE enters the code, updates the table, if necessary, and returns a copy of the letter
      to the submitting RC payroll office.

32.6. RC Payroll Office Actions.
   32.6.1. When the RC payroll office determines that a possible overpayment or erroneous payment of
   pay and allowances has occurred, it conducts a review of the JUMPS-RF Accounts Receivable Col-
   lections UH022-131, 132, or 135 to determine if the debt has already been identified. The titles of
   these reports can be found in appendix D of this manual.
   32.6.2. When an indebtedness is discovered after the MMPA is closed, the RC payroll office submits
   an MPO to DFAS-DE/FYDCI for out-of-service processing. The MPO must include complete
   description of indebtedness, including performance dates, amounts, accounting classification, voucher
   number of original payment, order number and any other pertinent information.
   32.6.3. Assembles and maintains supporting documents per Chapter 3, “Documentation Preparation
   and Submission Procedures”.
440                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      32.6.4. Notification of Member Indebtedness. Whenever a non-routine debt is discovered (see DoD-
      FMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 70704a(1) and (2)), the RC payroll office or DFAS-DE division discov-
      ering the debt prepares a letter, in duplicate, advising the member of the full details of the debt and the
      right to appeal the validity of the debt or to apply for a waiver of the debt.
         32.6.4.1. The original letter is sent to the member. A copy of the letter is retained as supporting
         documentation.
         32.6.4.2. The member has 30 days from the date of the letter to respond.
         32.6.4.3. If no response is received or the letter is returned as undeliverable, the office discovering
         the debt initiates appropriate collection action.

32.7. Member Appeal – Validity of Debt.
      32.7.1. If requested, the RC payroll office will assist the member who wishes to appeal validity of
      debt, amount, or rate of repayment. For appeal information, see the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 7,
      paragraph 70733.
      32.7.2. Provides the same documents for appeals as prescribed for waivers of indebtedness.

32.8. Overpayment of Pay and Allowances and Excess Leave.
      32.8.1. RC Payroll Office Debt Collection Transaction Submissions.
         32.8.1.1. Overpayment of Pay and Allowances. Inputs a B12 (IAD) transaction and/or C03 (AD)
         transaction for overpayment of pay and allowances. (See Table 32.2. and Table 32.3.), respec-
         tively, for the B12 and C03 transaction formats.)
             32.8.1.1.1. The B12/C03 will initiate complete computer processing when dates of perfor-
             mance are within immediate access storage (IAS).
             32.8.1.1.2. If dates of performance are outside IAS, submit a D01 or D02. See Chapter 43
             “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS”, for processing instructions on the
             D01 and D02.
             32.8.1.1.3. Submit separate B12 and C03 transactions for officer and airman status and when
             different accounting classifications are involved.
             32.8.1.1.4. A B12 collects two-thirds of base pay.
         32.8.1.2. Excess Leave Status. If member was in an excess leave status, compute the amount of
         overpayment of pay and allowances (see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 30251c for exception).
             32.8.1.2.1. Member does not accrue leave while in an excess leave status, therefore an addi-
             tional ½ day is charged for each six (6) days of excess leave.

32.9. DFAS-DE Debt Collection Actions – Debt Type DQ. The B12 and C03 transactions process on
each daily or coded update and generate DQ03 transactions. See Table 32.2. and Table 32.3., respec-
tively, for B12 and C03 formats. See Table 32.7. for the DQ03 format.
      32.9.1. As the debt is repaid, FICA wages and taxes will be decreased.
         32.9.1.1. If the receipt of the overpayment and the repayment occur in the same calendar year,
         current year-to-date FICA wages and taxes will be adjusted.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           441


       32.9.1.2. If the repayment of the debt occurs in the calendar year subsequent to the receipt of the
       overpayment, FICA wages and taxes will be decreased for the year the overpayment was received.
       32.9.1.3. A D13 will be computer generated to refund FICA for the tax year the overpayment was
       received and the following 3 years only. All later years will be ignored. As the debt is repaid
       FITW/SITW wages will be reduced.
          32.9.1.3.1. If the receipt of the overpayment and the repayment occur in the same calendar
          year, current year-to-date FITW/SITW wages will be adjusted.
          32.9.1.3.2. If the repayment of the debt occurs in the calendar year subsequent to the receipt
          of the overpayment, current year-to-date FITW/SITW wages will not be decreased and FITW/
          SITW deductions will not be adjusted.
       32.9.1.4. The DQ03 collects pay and allowances until the debt is satisfied. The default collection
       rate is two-thirds (2/3) of base pay and allowances.
   32.9.2. Reduced Collection Rate – DQ Debt Only.
       32.9.2.1. For the DQ debt only, a repayment schedule should not be arranged, unless the member
       can show an extreme hardship will be incurred by the default debt collection.
       32.9.2.2. To collect all pay, the RC payroll office processes a DQ07 (see Table 32.8. for the DQ07
       format).

32.10. Monetary Punishments – Debt Type DF.
   32.10.1. Forfeitures imposed as a result of judicial or non-judicial actions are submitted to DFAS-DE/
   FJPA for processing.
   32.10.2. Fines imposed as a result of judicial action are reported by the RC payroll office using a
   DF03 transaction (see Table 32.9. for the DF03 transaction format) transaction.
   32.10.3. The DF03 collects two-thirds of all base pay. See the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph
   70507 for guidance on collection procedures.
   32.10.4. If a repay schedule must be arranged, a DF07 (see Table 32.10. for the DF07 format) trans-
   action must be submitted to change the deduction rate and/or amount.
   32.10.5. The DF07 must accompany the DF03 transaction or two-thirds of base pay will be collected.

32.11. Reports Of Surveys And Statement Of Charges – Debt Type DG. Members may incur a debt
for the cost of government property lost, damaged, or destroyed (GPLD). Deduction from pay is based on
provision of DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 7, and table 7-7-3.
   32.11.1. RC Payroll Office DG Debt Processing.
       32.11.1.1. Receives DD Form 362, Statement of Charges for Government Property Lost, Dam-
       aged or Destroyed, or DD Form 200, Investigation of Property Loss, Financial Liability, (used to
       be an AF Form 198, Report of Survey for Air Force Property), prepared per AFR 177-111.
       32.11.1.2. If the debt is generated from a DD Form 200, the ADSN and “investigation”, or
       “Report of Survey” number must be included in the DG03 transaction (see Table 32.11. for the
       DG03 format).

             32.11.1.2.1. The DG03 collects two-thirds of base pay.
             32.11.1.2.2. If an alternate repay schedule has been arranged, a DG07 (see Table 32.12. for
             the DG07 format) transaction must be submitted to change the deduction rate and/or amount.
             32.11.1.2.3. The DG07 transaction must accompany the DG03 transactions or two-thirds base

32.12. All Other Debts – Debt Type DS.
      32.12.1. The RC payroll office reports, on DD Forms 139, all non-appropriated fund debts, bad
      checks, etc., (known as “All Other” debts using DS03). (See Table 32.15. for the DS03 format).
      32.12.2. These debts require a company code as found on Table 11. See 32.5., “Company Codes”.
      32.12.3. If Table 11 does not have any entry for the institution reporting the indebtedness, then estab-
      lish one per /TBL11A/.
      32.12.4. After Table 11 is updated, process DS03.
         32.12.4.1. Duplicate/Double Check Indebtedness.
             32.12.4.1.1. The RC payroll office should double check indebtedness results when a member
             claims non-receipt of a check and is issued a replacement and both checks are cashed.
                 32.12.4.1.1.1. The Treasury Department notifies DFAS-DE of the double payment.
                 32.12.4.1.1.2. DFAS-DE contacts the member and requests repayment.
                 32.12.4.1.1.3. If member does not respond, the RC payroll office is notified of the debt
                 and must take collection action.
                 32.12.4.1.1.4. If member alleges the check endorsement to be a forgery, request TFS Form
                 1133, Claim Against the United States for the Proceeds of a Government Check, from
                 DFAS-DE/WFCA, Replacement Check Desk, for member to complete.
                 32.12.4.1.1.5. No further action is required until claim is settled and notification is
                 received.
         32.12.4.2. Member Repayment.
             32.12.4.2.1. If the member chooses to repay the duplicate payment, have the member issue a
             personal check, postal money order, or other negotiable instrument in the amount of the origi-
             nal payment, made payable to AFO/DFAS-DE, and mail it to DFAS-DE/WFCA, Box 20030,
             Denver, CO 80220-3000, ATTN: Replacement Check Desk.
             32.12.4.2.2. If member does not make cash (check) settlement, the RC payroll office pro-
             cesses a DS03 to establish the debt in the member’s pay account. See Table 32.15. for the
             DS03 format.
      32.12.5. Bankruptcies, Tax Levies, Garnishments, and Debts.
         32.12.5.1. Bankruptcies, tax levies, garnishments, and debts against Reserve pay are input and
         controlled by DFAS-DE/FJP.
         32.12.5.2. The DS03 collects two-thirds of all base pay as defined in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A.
         See Table 32.15. for the DS03 format. Effective March 1, 2002 garnishments will not be prorated.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           443


      For example, if a member does not serve a full month, we will still take the full amount of the gar-
      nishment, if available. We will not prorate based on the number of days the member was paid in
      the month.
          32.12.5.2.1. If an alternate repay schedule has been arranged, a DS07 transaction must be sub-
          mitted to change the deduction rate and/or deduction amount. (See Table 32.16. for the DS07
          format.)
          32.12.5.2.2. The DS07 must accompany the DS03 transaction or two-thirds of base pay will
          be collected.
   32.12.6. Salary Offset to Non-DoD Agencies. Under the debt collection act of 1982 and 5 United
   States Code 5514, we are required to collect debts for members who have delinquent accounts with
   non-DoD agencies. Neither DJMS-RC nor the member’s unit has the authority to adjudicate, negoti-
   ate, resolve, or cancel these debts. By law, the member is required to pay 15 percent of their dispos-
   able pay until these debts are fully collected. Members are provided a notification letter by the pay
   system. This letter provides them with guidance to contact the creditor agency with questions. These
   debts are DS debts with a debt type of “T”. Military pay offices should instruct members with these
   debts to contact the creditor agency. Military pay offices must not adjust these debts.
   32.12.7. Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Debts. AAFES debts will be input into
   DJMS-RC, via automated transfer, by HQ AAFES. HQ AAFES is responsible for providing due pro-
   cess, for answering the member’s questions regarding the AAFES debt, and for making corrections to
   the AAFES debt. AAFES can be reached at 1-800-833-4489 within the United States. The DSN num-
   ber is 967-6041. Members overseas should contact their local AAFES outlet.

32.13. Advance Payment Reporting – Debt Type DV.
   32.13.1. The RC payroll office reports the payment of an advance of pay with a DV03 transaction
   (see Table 32.17. for the DV03 format). The transaction must include the voucher number, the pay-
   ment authorization control number and DSSN of the AFO making the payment. The DV03 must be
   submitted not later than the day following the day the payment was authorized.
   32.13.2. The DV03 collects two-thirds of all base pay. If a repay schedule has been arranged, a DV07
   transaction (see Table 32.18. for the DV07 format) must be submitted to change the deduction rate
   and/or deduction amount. The DV07 transaction must accompany the DV03 transaction, or two-thirds
   of base pay will be collected.

32.14. Partial Payment Reporting – DW.
   32.14.1. The RC payroll office reports partial payments with a DW03 transaction (see Table 32.19.
   for the DW03 format). The DW03 must be submitted the day following the day the payment was
   authorized.
   32.14.2. The DW03 collects two-thirds of base pay. If a repay schedule has been arranged, a DW07
   transaction must be submitted to change the deduction rate and/or deduction amount. The DW07
   transaction must accompany the DW03 transaction, or two-thirds of base pay will be collected. See
   Table 32.19. and Table 32.20., respectively, for the DW03 and DW07 transactions.

32.15. Non-Prior Service Indebtedness – DW.
444                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      32.15.1. Lackland payments to basic trainees are reported to DFAS-DE using an E01 transaction.
      Upon processing the E01, a computer generated DW03 transaction is created and posted to the mem-
      ber’s account and the accounts receivable file.
      32.15.2. The DW03 collects two-thirds of base pay.
      32.15.3. If a hardship is encountered by a member, with commander’s approval, the RC payroll office
      has the capability of changing the repay schedule using the DW07 transaction. A DW07 is required
      for each payment if other than two-thirds collection of base pay is required.
      32.15.4. The E01 transaction reporting early release from Lackland are covered in 10.3.1.2., “Lack-
      land AFO”.

32.16. Bonus Terminations. Follow procedures in 22.6.2.6., “Bonus Termination”.

32.17. Rejected Transactions. With the exception of the B12/C03 transactions outside of immediate
access storage (IAS), all indebtedness transactions reject to the input source, that is, RC payroll office
rejects appear on PCN UH022-164 with a narrative message explaining the reason for the reject. The RC
payroll office takes corrective action and resubmits the transaction on the following update.

32.18. Reports – Accounts Receivable.
      32.18.1. Daily Reports – UH022-131. Accounts receivable transactions posted to the accounts receiv-
      able file are reported to the RC payroll office on PCN UH022-131. The report is created after each
      daily update and contains information needed to confirm processing and to respond to members’
      inquiries. (See Figure 32.2.)
      32.18.2. Weekly Reports.
         32.18.2.1. UH022-132 and UH022-133.
             32.18.2.1.1. An inventory of all accounts receivable since the last paying update are reported
             on the PCN UH022-132 and UH022-133. (See Figure 32.3. and Figure 32.) These reports are
             on every paying update in addition to PCN UH022-131.
             32.18.2.1.2. Each collection will be correctly accounted for, as originally established, for the
             life of the debt.
         32.18.2.2. UH022-135.
             32.18.2.2.1. PCN UH022-135 is run with the Code 3. It provides detailed member indebted-
             ness inventory and status of all debts on file (see Figure 32.5.).
             32.18.2.2.2. Closed or satisfied debts are removed from the accounts receivable inventory fol-
             lowing Code 3 end of month processing cycle.

32.19. Separation with Open Debt.
      32.19.1. RC payroll offices must review each UH022-160 for 900 transactions on separating mem-
      bers. (See Table 43.36. for the 900 transaction format.)
      32.19.2. Upon receipt, of the UH022-160 with the 900 transactions, the payroll office must review the
      member’s record for indebtedness.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                          445


   32.19.3. If a member is separating with open debts, the payroll office must advise the member by let-
   ter of the open debts and of the member’s responsibility to satisfy these debts.
   32.19.4. The payroll office also informs the member that their debt file will be transferred to
   DFAS-POD/DE 90 days from the date of separation (DOS) and they must contact DFAS-POD/DE for
   debt resolution after this period.
   32.19.5. Payroll offices must not attempt collection action after this 90-day period.

32.20. Debt Identified After Separation. If the RC payroll office identifies that a member has a debt
which is the result of Reserve duty, such as overpayment of pay and allowances, or other DJMS-RC
related debt, it will do one of the following:
   32.20.1. If DJMS-RC record is still on file, RC payroll office processes the appropriate debt transac-
   tion.
   32.20.2. If DJMS-RC record has been deleted from file, submit a DD Form 139 to DFAS-POD/DE
   for out of service debt processing. The completed DD Form 139 should also include a full explanation
   of the debt, money amount to be collected, and have the necessary supporting documentation
   attached.
       32.20.2.1. For a debt, which is a result of other than a DJMS-RC payment, such as an overpay-
       ment of per diem, shipment of household goods, etc., the RC payroll office returns the document
       to the originating office with a statement that member is no longer in the Reserve forces.
       32.20.2.2. The input source (i.e., RC payroll office, DFAS-PMJPR/DE, PMJP, or POD, etc.) that
       established the out of service debt is responsible for notifying the member and providing a com-
       plete explanation of the debt.

32.21. Collections. RC payroll offices may accept negotiable instruments (personal check, cashier
check, postal money order, etc.) as payment for indebtedness.
   32.21.1. RC payroll office prepares a DD Form 114. The DD Form 114 must include member’s name,
   SSN, amount of indebtedness, accounting classification, and a complete explanation of the reason for
   the collection.
   32.21.2. The negotiable instrument (NI) must be payable to AFO/DFAS-DE.
   32.21.3. MPO and NI are mailed to DFAS-ADC/DE, P.O. Box 20030, Denver CO 80220-3000.
   32.21.4. Collections to be applied to accounts receivables are posted by DFAS-PMJFAB/DE.
   32.21.5. Indebtedness settled by direct remittance from the member will be forwarded directly to the
   activity concerned along with the indebtedness document.

32.22. Travel Debts. All AFRES/ANG travel debts will be sent directly to the RC payroll office for
first-line review and collection action by commanders. The travel section establishes a 30-day suspense
upon commander’s notification of debt. Commander takes collection action:
   32.22.1. If debt is collected, DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is forwarded directly to the
   Travel Section. Travel credits member’s account.
446                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      32.22.2. If debt is uncollectible, the Travel Section issues a DD Form 139. The RC payroll office
      takes collection action per 32.12., “All Other Debts – Debt Type DS”.
      32.22.3. Travel debts for IMAs are handled directly between the IMA and the active duty AFO which
      established the debt. If the debt is uncollectible, the AFO issues a DD Form 139 and sends it to the
      AFRES RC payroll office in Denver (for address, see 1.8.1.4., “AFRES RC Payroll Office in Den-
      ver”).

32.23. Garnishment of Pay and Allowances.
      32.23.1. Authority to Garnish Pay. Federal statute authorizes the garnishment of military pay for child
      support and payment of alimony (see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 7, section B) (42 U.S.C. 659).

         32.23.4.4. Collects amounts ordered (see 32.12., “All Other Debts – Debt Type DS”) and dis-
         burses to court per instructions from DFAS-PMJA/DE. Effective March 1, 2002 garnishments will
         not be prorated. For example, if a member does not serve a full month, we will still take the full
         amount of the garnishment, if available. We will not pro-rate based on the number of days the
         member was paid in the month.
         32.23.4.5. Disburses remaining amounts due, if any, to member.
         32.23.4.6. Establishes indebtedness for amounts due if continuous garnishment is court-ordered.

      32.24.1. DR debts are used to collect “for others” appropriated fund indebtedness.
      32.24.2. Input of the DR transaction will not require a check to be written as with the DS debts. The
      DR debt is used to establish debts for all DoD appropriated funds other than pay and allowances. The
      DR indebtedness type is “6”. See Table 32.13. and Table 32.14., respectively, for DR03 and DR07
      formats.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            447


32.25. Collection Transaction Formats.
   32.25.1. B12, Collection of UTA/AFTPs/PTs, and IAD Incentive Pay.
      32.25.1.1. A computer generated DQ03 will establish the debt for the gross amount of the over-
      payment. A separate DQ03 will be generated for each calendar year the overpayment was
      received. “Calendar year overpayment was received” is the calendar year the overpayment funds
      were received.
      32.25.1.2. The B12 with a debt bypass code in the HPSP ad ADJ/check cancel indicator field
      (position 57) is used by DFAS-PMJP/DE for inactive duty check cancellation. FICA wages and
      tax will be adjusted systemically. Process a manual D01 to adjust current year-to-date FITW/
      SITW wages and deductions.
      32.25.1.3. One or more B12 TINs may be submitted on the same update for different dates.
      32.25.1.4. The B12 must not be processed until after the original B10/B11 (dates to be collected)
      has processed and paid.
      32.25.1.5. FITW deduction will not be adjusted on any overpayment.
      32.25.1.6. The first two positions of the PAS in the B12 must match the PAS in the original B10/
      B11 or the B12 will reject.
      32.25.1.7. If any period does not match History File 1 dates previously paid or posted, then the
      B12 rejects. However, if the period is for points only, nonpay inactive duty, the B12 will not reject
      since HF1 is not updated for this type of duty.
      32.25.1.8. If collecting points only non-pay inactive duty days, no indebtedness will be estab-
      lished as no pay was received for the duty.
      32.25.1.9. A separate B12 must be submitted for each month adjusted.
      32.25.1.10. Twelve periods within 1 month may be collected on each B12.
      32.25.1.11. Submit separate B12s for days performed in airman status and in officer status.
      32.25.1.12. If any period does not match HF1 dates or periods previously paid, then the B12
      rejects.
      32.25.1.13. Submit separate B12 transactions for UTAs, AFTPs, PT and Point only nonpay inac-
      tive duty.
      32.25.1.14. Use the B12 to collect UTAs performed before BMT while in V or W status.
      32.25.1.15. If a performance date of 12 April reported and paid as an AFTP, but should have been
      reported as a UTA, submit a B12 to collect the AFTP and a B11 to pay the UTA on the next
      update. The same would apply if 12 April was originally reported and paid as a UTA, but should
      have been as AFTP: submit B12 to collect UTA and B10 to pay the AFTP on the next update.
      32.25.1.16. If UTA reported and paid for 15 April, but should have been reported for 16 April,
      submit a B12 to collect 15 April and on the same daily input a B11 to pay the UTA for 16 April.
   32.25.2. C03, Collect Active Duty Tour or Three Entitlements.
      32.25.2.1. To collect two nonconsecutive tours, two C03s must be submitted. If the adjustment
      month has 31 days, the 31st day may be used.
448                                                              AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      32.25.2.2. The original C03 will be converted into multiple C03s if the overpayment period
      involves more than one paid date. A C03 will be generated for each calendar year the overpayment
      was received. If one or more of the C03s reject, correct the input and reprocess only for the period
      of the C03 reject, correct the input and reprocess only for the period of the C03 that rejected. A
      computer generated DQ03 will establish the debt for the gross amount of the overpayment. A sep-
      arate DQ03 will be generated for each calendar year the overpayment was received.
      32.25.2.3. FITW deduction is not adjusted on overpayments.
      32.25.2.4. One or more C03 transactions for different tours of active duty may be submitted on
      one update.
      32.25.2.5. Data to pay a member pay and/or allowances at a different rate than the rates being col-
      lected by the C03 must be input the following update after the C03 has processed.
      32.25.2.6. When collecting a full day of pay and allowances, and that day was used as the tour end
      date in a C11 transaction, the C03 will reject to DFAS-PMJP/DE for removal of the leave data
      from the HF1 entry. DFAS-PMJP/DE will then reinput the C03 for collection of the full days of
      pay and allowances. The unit payroll office must then process a new C11 to pay the correct num-
      ber of days of accrued leave.
      32.25.2.7. To collect all pay and allowances, use FID 01 (base pay). To collect pay and allowances
      other than base pay, use the appropriate FID as shown in Table 27.2.
      32.25.2.8. When collecting the last day of a tour using FID 01 in ENTITLEMENT ID, positions
      16-17, BAH must be collected for the new end day since BAH is not payable for the last day of the
      tour. Submit a separate C03 with FID 58 to collect BAH only for the new ending date.
      32.25.2.9. The C03 with a debt bypass code in the HPSP AD ADJ/CHECK CANCEL INDICA-
      TOR field (position 58) is used by DFAS-PMJP/DE for AD check cancellation.
      32.25.2.10. Adjustments to FICA wages and taxes will be done systematically. Process a manual
      D01 to adjust FITW/SITW wages and taxes.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                  449

                                                Chapter 34

                                         SPECIAL PROGRAMS

34.1. Section A – Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC).
      34.1.1. Field Training Entitlement Overview.
         34.1.1.1. AFROTC participants are entitled to a monthly subsistence allowance, payment of
         books and fees, payment of commutation/clothing allowance, and summer camp/training base
         pay, as applicable.
         34.1.1.2. Beginning in November 1995, the AFROTC MU system will be replaced by the
         DJMS-RC system and JUMPS Data Collection III (JDC III). Checks will be issued by DJMS-RC
         via Direct Deposit/EFT and pay report will be provided by DFAS-DE to HQ AFROTC, Maxwell
         AFB, Alabama.
         34.1.1.3. Pay data will be created via the AFROTC Financial Cadet Logistics Information Man-
         agement Systems (AFCLIMS) and JDC III. Corrections will be made at HQ AFROTC using the
         Reserve Component Input System (RCIS).
         34.1.1.4. HQ AFROTC is the overall Air Force ROTC program administrator. Refer to the
         AFCLIMS user’s manual for required documents and procedures in processing personnel and pay
         information.
      34.1.2. Systems Interface.
         34.1.2.1. Software, created and maintained by the HQ AFROTC systems communication branch,
         is used to extract key data from the AFCLIMS. This data is then passed to DJMS-RC for pay pur-
         poses.
         34.1.2.2. AFROTC personnel at the senior units (detachments and operating locations located at
         universities and colleges) transmit data to HQ AFROTC via the AFROTC electronic mail net-
         work, to create transactions to update the cadet master file. Data will include payment request and
         personnel data for students. Refer to the AFCLIMS user’s manual for more information.
         34.1.2.3. HQ AFROTC generates the DJMS-RC transactions and transmits the personnel and pay
         request data to DFAS-DE. DJMS-RC processes, records and reports the ROTC data. For example,
         HQ AFROTC sends the accession transactions, AA1, A05, A06, A07, and A08 to DJMS-RC. If
         all the transactions process, DJMS-RC establishes the MMPA and the student master file. Pay-
         ments to students, such as ROTC subsistence, books and fees, and commutation/clothing allow-
         ances, are processed by DJMS-RC based on the pay request transactions received from HQ
         AFROTC. Recycles and rejects are reported back to HQ AFROTC. See Section 34.6. for a com-
         plete explanation of the student master and Figure 6.52. for a complete example of the student
         master inquiry screen.
         34.1.2.4. HQ AFROTC submits the personnel and pay corrections using the Reserve Component
         Input System (RCIS), and XCOM, a communications data transfer package, to DFAS-DE. See the
         Joint Automated Data Systems Manual, Book II, for instructions on how to use RCIS. See the
         AFROTC XCOM Desktop Guidance for using XCOM.

     34.1.2.5. ROTC Summer Camp and ROTC Field Training pay request data is input by the Air
     Force active duty base where this training occurs. Data is created and transmitted to DJMS-RC via
     JDC III. See DFAS-DEM 7073-1.
  34.1.3. Accessions.
     34.1.3.1. Gains to DJMS-RC
         34.1.3.1.1. HQ AFROTC submits the following transactions to DJMS-RC to establish the
         Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) and student master files: AA1, A05, A06, A07, and
         A08. The accession transactions provide the basic member data, to include: name, social secu-
         rity number, unit identification, mailing address, tax status, and elections.
         34.1.3.1.2. The AA1, A06, A07, and A08 must process in order to create a full gain and estab-
         lish the MMPA. The A05 transaction, when processed, establishes the student master, to
         include the following data: enrollment date, school code, projected graduation or separation

         34.1.3.2. Dual Status. Dual status for ROTC purposes is defined as a member who maintains sta-
         tus both in ROTC and in a regular Reserve or Guard unit. When a member has status in both the
         ROTC and Guard/Reserve program, the MMPA will record the Guard/Reserve data and the stu-
         dent master will record the ROTC data. Taxable wage and tax information will be recorded on the
         MMPA.
         34.1.3.3. Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI). See Chapter 31 for codes and amounts
         of coverage.
         34.1.3.4. Administrative Information. HQ AFROTC submits the administrative information to
         DJMS-RC for all ROTC members. If a member is in a dual status, both the Guard/Reserve Pay-
         roll/Personnel offices and HQ AFROTC may submit applicable changes to DJMS-RC. Regardless
         of the source, the last transaction submitted and processed will post the MMPA and student mas-
         ter. As an example, if the Guard payroll office submits an A07 and A08 to change the member’s
         address on Julian date 125, those transactions will update the member’s address again. If then, HQ
         AFROTC submits an A07 and A08 to change the member’s address on Julian date 127, the mem-
         ber’s address will be updated again.
            34.1.3.4.1. Address Change: A07 and A08 (See Table 2.7. and Table 2.8.).
            34.1.3.4.2. Tax Election Change: A17 (See Table 30.2.).

     tion on the Health Professional Stipend Program.
  34.2.6. Programs.
     34.2.6.1. Programs are identified by a program code and all student activity is recorded on a sub-
     sidiary file called the student master with the exception of grant payments which are recorded on
     the bonus master.
     34.2.6.2. See Table 34.7. for program codes.
  34.2.7. Student Master. The Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) will have an “H” in the ROTC/
  HPIP-IND: field to indicate this member is HPIP and has a student master file. See Chapter 34, Sec-
  tion F, for information about establishing a student master for HPIP/ROTC students.
  34.2.8. Stipend Payments.
     34.2.8.1. Stipend Payments will automatically stop on the graduation date recorded on the student
     master and a date of separation and loss counters will be posted to the MMPA except for STRAP
     participants in a dual status.
     34.2.8.2. The Stipend stops for dually assigned STRAP participants but the MMPA is left open for
     payments being made by the active unit.
  34.2.9. Separation of Medical Students.
     34.2.9.1. The graduation date on the student master will be used to separate members, or for a
     leave of absence, the pay status is curtailed until an amended graduation date is known.
     34.2.9.2. Do not use 900 transaction to report a separation for a medical student.
  34.2.10. Tuition, Fees, and Books.
     34.2.10.1. Tuition, Fees, and Books are managed by AFIT/CIMJ and will be paid VIA DJMS-RC.
     34.2.10.2. When payments are made using D02 transactions (See Chapter 43 and Table 43.3.),
     the amounts will accumulate on the student master.
  34.2.11. Accessions. Accessions will be processed as for any other member of the Air Reserve Forces
  using the AA1, A06, A07, A08 transactions (See Section 2.2.)
     34.2.11.1. HPIP Participants – A05 Transaction to Establish Student Master. For HPIP partici-
     pants, an A05 transaction must be processed (See Table 34.6. for A05 format). The A05 transac-
496                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         tion establishes the student master and posts a student indicator on the MMPA. When the A05
         processes the PAS code, PEC, and ST-PGMA, the MMPA will move to the student master –
         except for STRAP participants dually assigned. For details on the student master see paragraph
         34.6. See Table 34.6. for the A05 format.
         34.2.11.2. Dually Assigned Members. For dually assigned members only the A05 is needed for an
         accession; the MMPA is maintained by the active unit. For details on the student master, see para-
         graph 34.6.
      34.2.12. Electronic Fund Transfer. HPIP participants are required to participate in direct deposit, that
      is, pay will be sent via electronic fund transfer to an account in the members chosen financial institu-
      tion.
         34.2.12.1. The A18 transaction is used to record the financial institution and account information
         on the MMPA.
         34.2.12.2. The A18 transaction is used to establish a change or stop the transfer of funds.
         34.2.12.3. The A18 should be submitted at the same time as the accession transactions. It may
         also be submitted at any other time to change or stop the direct deposit account. See Chapter 2 for
         more information on accessions.
         34.2.12.4. See Chapter 7, for more information about the requirements for mandatory direct
         deposit. Hard copy checks will not be used to issue payments to the member.
      34.2.13. Stipend Payments. A24 transactions are used to start, stop, or correct stipend payments.
         34.2.13.1. For Health Professionals, the stipend start date should be the same as the enrollment
         date or the current program effective date. The stop date should be the same as the graduation date;
         however, this may not always be the case.
         34.2.13.2. Normally, stipend resumes after an active duty tour is paid and continues until the grad-
         uation date is reached.
      34.2.14. Break in Service. When there is a break in service the A24 may be used to stop stipend after
      an active tour has been paid. In such cases, the beginning date would be the date immediately follow-
      ing the latest active tour end date.
         34.2.14.1. Pay Status Code Changes and the A24
             34.2.14.1.1. When stipend is being started for the first time or restarted after a break in service
             (student master pay status is “A”) the A24 transaction is coded with an action indicator of “N”.
             34.2.14.1.2. When an existing A24 (pay status is “X”) is being changed, the A24 action indi-
             cator is “Y”.
             34.2.14.1.3. Calendar posting for stipend is a “70” on the student master. (See Table 9.5. for
             A24 format and Table 9.1. for pay status codes.)
      34.2.15. Orientation. Attending orientation prior to being paid a stipend, i.e., the member attends ori-
      entation in July and does not become entitled to stipend until September, it is necessary to start the sti-
      pend in September even though the member is paid an active duty tour in July.
      34.2.16. Active Duty Payments.
         34.2.16.1. Active Duty Requirements.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            497


        34.2.16.1.1. Active duty tours for both HPSP and FAP personnel are paid using the A24 trans-
        action with pay status “O” (special training).
            34.2.16.1.1.1. HPSP participants are required to perform 45 days of active duty each con-
            tract year.
            34.2.16.1.1.2. FAP participants are required to perform 14 days of active duty each con-
            tract year.
            34.2.16.1.1.3. STRAP participants are not required to perform active duty unless they are
            dually assigned to an active unit in which case the active unit will input the pay transac-
            tions.
        34.2.16.1.2. See paragraph 34.2.6. for more information.
     34.2.16.2. Pay and Allowances. Special pays and allowances are extracted from the MMPA for
     active duty tours. The following would apply to HPSP and FAP participants:
        34.2.16.2.1. Basic Pay – HPSP Participants. HPSP participants are paid as 2nd Lieutenants
        regardless of the rank they may have held prior to entering the program. They can carry for-
        ward the creditable service they have accumulated when they enter; however, longevity will
        not accrue while they are in the program. For instance a member enters with over 10 years ser-
        vice and over 4 years active enlisted service. The member would be paid as an 01 with over 10
        years creditable service for any active duty performed while in the program. Active duty days
        are posted as a “50” on the student master calendar.
        34.2.16.2.2. Basic Pay – FAP Participants. FAP participants are paid at the appointed rank for
        their active duty tours. They also may carry forward the creditable service they have accumu-
        lated when they enter the program, however, longevity will not accrue while they are in the
        program. For instance a member enters the program as a major with over six years service. The
        member would be paid as an 04 with over 6 years creditable service for any active duty per-
        formed while in the program. Active duty days are posted as “50” on the student master calen-
        dar.
        34.2.16.2.3. Basic Pay – STRAP Participants.
            34.2.16.2.3.1. STRAP Participants are not required to perform active duty tours unless
            they are dually assigned to an active Guard or Reserve unit. If they are assigned to an
            active unit the active and inactive duty is paid by the unit they are participating with and is
            recorded on the main MMPA calendar.
            34.2.16.2.3.2. See Chapter 6 for more information on the main MMPA calendar. See
            Chapter 8 for more information.
            34.2.16.2.3.3. Stipend does not stop when AD/IAD is paid.
     34.2.16.3. Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ).
        34.2.16.3.1. This allowance is paid based on the BAQ status recorded on the MMPA. Initially
        it is posted from the A06 transaction, however, if there are any changes in the member’s BAQ
        status, an A15 transaction (see Table 14.4.) must be processed to change it.
        34.2.16.3.2. Married members are always paid BAQ at the “with dependent” rate. Single
        members will automatically be paid “partial BAQ” unless an A30 transaction is submitted to
498                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


            pay BAQ single “in own right” when quarters are not available. See Section 14.3. for more
            information.
            34.2.16.3.3. Retroactive payments (i.e., payments made for entitlements due for prior dates)
            are made using a C04 transaction. See Section 27.2. and Table 27.4. for transaction format.
            34.2.16.3.4. See Chapter 14, “Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ)”, for more information.
         34.2.16.4. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS). Officers are automatically paid this allow-
         ance. Input is not necessary. See Chapter 13 for more information.
         34.2.16.5. Uniform Allowance (UA). Members entitled to a uniform allowance are paid using the
         B06 transaction. See Chapter 15 for more information.
         34.2.16.6. Family Separation Allowance (FSA).
            34.2.16.6.1. HPSP members separated from their families for more than 30 days are entitled
            to FSA. This entitlement is reported using the A33 transaction. See Chapter 17 for more
            information.
            34.2.16.6.2. Retroactive payments (i.e., payments made for entitlements due for prior dates)
            are made using a C05 transaction. See Table 27.5. for C05 transaction format.
         34.2.16.7. Medical, Dental, Veterinary, and Optometry Special Pay (MDVO)
            34.2.16.7.1. FAP Participants.
                34.2.16.7.1.1. FAP participants may be entitled to receive MDVO at the $450.00 per
                month rate. The entitlement may be recorded as part of the accession action using an A28
                transaction and will be paid automatically with the active duty tour. See Chapter 19 for
                more information.
                34.2.16.7.1.2. Retroactive payments (i.e., payments made for entitlements due for prior
                dates) are made using a D02 transaction. For more information, see Chapter 43, paragraph
                43.4.2. for non automated adjustments inside/outside IAS and Table 43.3. for D02 input
                transaction format.
            34.2.16.7.2. HPSP Participants. HPSP participants are not entitled to this special pay.
         34.2.16.8. Reimbursable Expenses. In rare cases the payroll office may be asked to reimburse a
         member for books or fees. This is usually done by AFIT. If the need should arise, use the D02
         transaction with the appropriate component of pay. See Chapter 43, Table 43.13.).
      34.2.17. Active Duty Reporting and Payment.
         34.2.17.1. Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP)
            34.2.17.1.1. Prior to Active Duty Start Date:
                34.2.17.1.1.1. The A24 “O” status tour can be input up to 90 days prior to the start date of
                the active duty tour.
                34.2.17.1.1.2. The A24 should be input as near as possible to the reporting date to allow
                for adjustments to the tour dates or possible cancellation of the tour.
            34.2.17.1.2. After the Active Duty Start Date – 45 Day Tour.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             499


             34.2.17.1.2.1. In the event the active duty orders are received late for HPSP or FAP partic-
             ipants, and the stipend has already been paid for all or a part of the tour, it is not necessary
             to collect back the stipend prior to submitting the A24, pay status “O”. The system will
             automatically collect the stipend and pay basic pay and allowances.
             34.2.17.1.2.2. When the active duty tour has paid out, the pay status will revert to stipend
             automatically unless the active duty tour is paid before the stipend entitlement commences.
             If the tour is totally retroactive, stipend payments will continue uninterrupted.
     34.2.17.2. Financial Assistance Program (FAP).
         34.2.17.2.1. Process a C01 transaction to pay FAP participants their 14 day tour of active duty.
         It is not necessary to stop the stipend or collect the stipend paid, DJMS-RC will curtail the sti-
         pend payments, set up a debt, pay the active duty tour and resume stipend payments at tour
         end. The tour must not be input until it has been completed (use tour type 5, special training
         and check disposition 1). Payment will be sent to the financial institution of the members
         choice, or to the home address on the members MMPA if no EFT information is present on the
         MMPA. Reference C01 format in Chapter 9.
         34.2.17.2.2. Member will be paid for actual days of performance. That is, if the 31st day of a
         month is involved, it will be paid as a day of duty. If the 29th and 30th of February are involved
         (non-leap year) they will not be paid.
     34.2.17.3. Adjustments to Active Duty Payments.
         34.2.17.3.1. Retroactive payments for special pay and allowances not paid with the active
         duty tour may be paid using C04 or C05 transactions if the payment is within IAS. (See Chap-
         ter 27.)
         34.2.17.3.2. Retroactive Payments for additional entitlements or duty performed outside IAS
         require input of unique transactions. (See Chapter 43.)
  34.2.18. Accrued Leave Payments. HPSP participants accrue leave on their 45 day tour. To pay the
  unused accrued leave, process a C11 transaction after the tour has been completed. (See Chapter 29.)
  34.2.19. Erroneous Payments.
     34.2.19.1. Payments made in error may be collected back using a C03 transaction (See Table
     32.3.) if, at the time of collection, the dates are still within IAS. If the payment needs to be cor-
     rected, it may require input of a C04 (See Table 27.4.) or C05 (See Table 27.5.) transaction to
     make the payment correctly. For example: If a member was paid BAQ partial rate on the active
     duty tour and should have been paid single in own right, it is necessary to use a C03 transaction to
     collect the partial rate and a C04 transaction to pay the correct rate.
     34.2.19.2. If the adjustment is outside IAS, a D02 transaction would be used to either collect and
     repay or pay the difference.
     34.2.19.3. Overpayments require input of a C03 transaction when the overpayment is within IAS
     or a unique transaction payment is outside IAS (see Chapter 43). This applies to both stipend and
     active duty pay and allowances.
     34.2.19.4. Erroneous payment of uniform allowances would require a DQ03 (See Table 32.7.)
     and a B06 transaction (See Table 15.4.), action indicator “2”, to adjust the MMPA.
500                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         34.2.19.5. Erroneous payment of leave requires a military pay order to DFAS-DE/FJPR to collect
         the leave, clear history file one and adjust leave days recorded on the MMPA.
         34.2.19.6. Other indebtedness is reported as with any other account (see Chapter 32).
      34.2.20. Transfers. Members transferring from one program to another will be treated as a new gain.
      Personnel will submit the AA1 transaction and payroll office will submit the A05, A06, A07, A08,
      and A18 transactions as they would for any new gain regardless of the fact that the MMPA and a stu-
      dent master are already on file. MMPA data will be overlaid and the current program will move to
      prior program on the student master. The new program will then move to current program. A09 trans-
      actions cannot be used to transfer a member from one program to another.
      34.2.21. Losses. The graduation date on the student master will be used exclusively to terminate a
      record. When the graduation date is reached a date of separation and loss counters will be posted to the
      MMPA. The 900 transaction will not be used to separate an account. Six months from the date of sep-
      aration the file will be purged from the master file.
      34.2.22. Reactivate a Closed Account.
         34.2.22.1. The A05 transaction (see Table 34.6.) has been designed to change certain data ele-
         ments in the student master after it has been established. If an account is closed and the program
         has not changed, the graduation date may be extended to open the account.
         34.2.22.2. An A24 transaction (See Table 9.5.) will also be needed to restart stipend.
      34.2.23. Processing Changes to the Student Master.
         34.2.23.1. The A05 transaction has been designed to change certain data elements in the student
         master after it has been established.
             34.2.23.1.1. If a change is required to school code, program effective date, counselor code,
             date of enrollment, or date of graduation, submit an A05 transaction with an action indicator of
             “2” with the updated data entered in the appropriate fields.
             34.2.23.1.2. Only the data changing needs to be entered in the A05 transaction, in addition to
             common data, such as name, SSN, PEC, PAS, and ST-PGMA. If the program code changes,
             the program effective date must also be changed.
      34.2.24. Extending the Graduation Date. Use the A05 Transaction to Extend the Date. If the tour is
      still paying, the A24 transaction end date must also be extended.
      34.2.25. Curtailing the Graduation Date.
         34.2.25.1. When the graduation date is curtailed, but the pay status tour end date has not been
         reached, it is not necessary to input an A24 transaction. The stipend will automatically stop when
         the graduation date is reached.
         34.2.25.2. When curtailing the graduation date via an A05 transaction and the member has
         already been paid beyond that date, the pay status will be changed to pay status “A” with the
         beginning date of “000000” and ending date of “999999”.
         34.2.25.3. A management notice will be generated advising the payroll office to take collection
         action. The debt will not be generated automatically.
      34.2.26. Changing the Program Effective Date or Enrollment Date
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            501


      34.2.26.1. When changing the program effective date or enrollment date, precautions should be
      taken to adjust the amount of stipend paid if necessary.
      34.2.26.2. If date is moved back, a second A24 transaction may be needed to pay the period
      before the recorded pay status start date.
      34.2.26.3. If the date is moving ahead, collection action may be necessary. The debt will not be
      generated automatically.
   34.2.27. Taxation. Stipend is subject to FITW and SITW but, is not subject to FICA. Active duty
   basic pay is subject to FITW, SITW, and FICA (See Chapter 30 for changes to deductions).
   34.2.28. Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance. See Chapter 31, “SGLI and SSLI – Life Insur-
   ance”.

34.3. Section C – Medical Services Bonuses.
   34.3.1. Entitlements.
      34.3.1.1. Individuals participating in the Financial Assistance Program (FAP) for health profes-
      sionals are entitled to an annual grant in addition to the authorized stipend paid to Health Profes-
      sions Scholarship Program participants under certain conditions. Grants are awarded to eligible
      physician residents and fellows in specialized training in return for an active duty obligation.
      34.3.1.2. Newly recruited physicians and nurses agreeing to incur a ‘SELRES’ obligation are
      entitled to a bonus effective the date the member signs the contract agreeing to such an obligation.
      Payments continue to be paid annually for the duration of the obligation.
   34.3.2. Financial Assistance Program Grants.
      34.3.2.1. The current rate for a FAP bonus grant is $17,865.00. The amount of the grant is
      reviewed and increased as appropriate in the same manner as provided for the stipend. The rate
      normally changes every year on July 1st, if there has been a pay increase for other members of the
      Armed Forces.
      34.3.2.2. Grants are paid on a pro-rata basis for partial years of participation. The date of gradua-
      tion on the bonus master will determine the final payment.
      34.3.2.3. Termination action will result in total recoupment of all grant payments via DQ03 gen-
      erated by the bonus program. If it is determined by the Service Secretary that recoupment be
      waived as being in the best interest of the Government, do not submit the termination action. If the
      Secretary determines that only a portion of the grant is to be recouped, it will be necessary to

      $10,000.00 for physicians. Payments are made at the beginning of each period of selected Reserve
      service, the effective date being the date the member signs the contract, and paid annually for each
      year of service.
      34.3.3.2. Payments are not prorated, each payment is for one full year of the obligation.
      34.3.3.3. An officer who voluntarily terminates service in the Selected Reserves before the end of
      the period for which a payment was made will be required to refund to the United States the full
502                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         amount of the payment on which the payment was based. Termination action will result in recoup-
         ment of the last payment made to the member, assuming this is the period the member did not sat-
         isfactorily complete. Debts will not be automatically suspended.
      34.3.4. Supporting Documents. The supporting document for both the FAP Grant and the Accession

         34.3.5.2. Authorization numbers do not apply to officer bonuses and will not be used.
         34.3.5.3. Installment numbers and amounts payable are computer-generated and will not be coded
         in the transaction.
         34.3.5.4. If the MMPA is not a full gain the B03 – action type “1” transaction will recycle until the
         gain action is reported or will recycle for seven times and then reject on the eighth recycle.
         34.3.5.5. Bonus types determine the number of anniversary payments the member will receive.
         34.3.5.6. A graduation date has been added to the bonus master to govern the final payment for
         FAP bonuses.
         34.3.5.7. The bonus type and date of enrollment are the only two items that will be displayed on
         the MMPA. The payment fields are not large enough to handle the amounts paid and this informa-
         tion will eventually be removed from the MMPA since we now have inquiry capability.
      34.3.6. Terminations.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              503


     34.3.6.1. B03 – action type “2” transactions submitted on FAP bonuses will result in a debt being
     generated for the total amount paid to date on the accounts receivable. The debt will not be sus-
     pended as is currently done for enlisted bonus debts.
     34.3.6.2. B03 – action type “2” submitted for Accession Test Bonuses will result in a debt being
     generated for the last payment to the member. The assumption is made that this is the period for
     which the member has not satisfactorily fulfilled his obligation. The debt will not be suspended as
     is currently done for enlisted bonus debts.
  34.3.7. Changes to the Bonus Master. B03 – action type “3” transactions submitted for changes to the
  bonus master for medical bonuses will be handled by the DFAS-DE central site. The unit may submit
  the transaction reflecting the changes but the transaction will reject to the processing lines for possible
  adjustments to the account.
  34.3.8. Payments.
     34.3.8.1. B03 – action type “6” transactions will be submitted when initial and anniversary pay-
     ments are due the member. Installment number and amounts will be computer-generated for med-
     ical officer bonuses.
     34.3.8.2. FAP bonuses are paid on a pro-rata basis on the final installment. For example: A mem-
     ber enters the program for 18 months. The first installment would be for one full year and the sec-
     ond installment would be for 6 months, based on a daily rate for a 30-day month.
     34.3.8.3. Accession Test Bonuses are paid at a flat rate of $6,000.00 or $10,000.00 for each year
     of service.
     34.3.8.4. Anniversary dates will be displayed on the members LES 90 days prior to the entitle-
     ment date.
     34.3.8.5. Payroll offices will be alerted 90 days prior to the anniversary date on PCN UH022-164
     report with a management notice. The management notice will continue to be generated until the
     payment is made or the bonus is terminated or payment suspended.
     34.3.8.6. LES remarks will specifically identify the bonus type in the entitlements portion of the
     LES.
     34.3.8.7. Bonuses will be taxed as a one time payment at 28% for federal. State taxes will be com-
     puted by dividing the payment by 12 before taxing and multiplying the tax amount by 12, thus
     avoiding an excessive amount of state tax being withheld. Bonuses are not subject to FICA.
     34.3.8.8. In unusual cases the D02 transaction (converts to D13 transaction) may be used in
     adjusting bonus payments. This will be done at central site. Components of pay are ‘UC’ for FAP
     bonuses, ‘WW’ for the $6000.00 Accession Test Bonus, and ‘WX’ for the $10,000.00 Accession
     Test Bonus. APCs for bonuses are as follows: FAP – ZZZ785, Accession Test Initial – ZZZ853,
     Accession Test Anniversary – ZZZ854. When a D13 transaction is used it will be accompanied by
     a B03 – action type “3” to change the bonus master record.
  34.3.9. Suspension.
     34.3.9.1. Suspensions are reported via B03 – action type “7” transactions and released via B03 –
     action type “8” transactions. Payments submitted while a bonus record is in a suspended status
     will recycle until the release action is received.
504                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         34.3.9.2. Anniversary dates are extended when a suspension release date is received, based on
         dates of suspension and release.

                                                  Chapter 35

                             WAIVER OF COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS

35.1. Members With Prior Military Service.
      35.1.1. Entitlement. Members of the Reserve components, who are receiving a pension, disability
      compensation, retainer pay, or retirement pay from the United States Government for prior military
      service and perform duty for which they are entitled to pay, may elect to receive either the benefits for
      their prior military service or, if they specifically waive those benefits, the pay and allowances autho-
      rized for the duty they are performing (see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 80204).
      35.1.2. Supporting Documents. These members may be initially identified to RC payroll offices by
      the certificates on AF Form 1288, Application for Reserve Assignment, for officers, and DD Form
      1966, Record of Military Processing – Armed Forces of the United States, for airmen, or other person-
      nel documents.

35.2. Waiver of Retired Pay.
      35.2.1. RC Payroll Office.
         35.2.1.1. The member completes a one-time waiver of retired pay on AF Form 1962, Election of
         Reserve Pay and Allowances or Benefits from Prior Military Service. The form is completed by
         putting an “X” in the Retired Pay block, 360 days in total days paid, and signature of the Reservist
         in item II of the AF Form 1962.
         35.2.1.2. The RC payroll office submits an A21 transaction (see Table 35.1. for the A21 transac-
         tion format).
         35.2.1.3. The original AF Form 1962 is retained as a supporting document, and a copy may be
         held in a supporting document file.
      35.2.2. RAPS Interface Action.
         35.2.2.1. Each month, DJMS-RC passes a file of all Reserve members who were paid during the
         month (along with the number of days each was paid) to the Retired Annuitant Pay System
         (RAPS).
         35.2.2.2. If a waiver code is on the member’s DJMS-RC record, RAPS reduces the following
         month’s annuity by the number of Reserve days paid.
         35.2.2.3. If a retired pay waiver is not indicated, and member is drawing retired pay, the annuity
         is not reduced, but a management notice is generated which requires action.
         35.2.2.4. DFAS-DE/FR forwards a list of members requiring action to DFAS-DE/FJ.
      35.2.3. Dual-Pay Status.
         35.2.3.1. When the RC payroll office is notified that member is in a dual-pay status, it immedi-
         ately advises the member that a waiver of retired pay must be filed or Reserve pay will be stopped.
         Provides the member with an AF Form 1962.
         35.2.3.2. If no response is received from the member within 30 days, the RC payroll office sends
         a second request.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           535


      35.2.3.3. When waiver is received from the member, the RC payroll office submits an A21 trans-
      action (see Table 35.1. for the A21 format).
      35.2.3.4. If no waiver is received from the member within 60 days, the RC payroll office submits
      an A21 transaction to waive Reserve pay and starts collection of Reserve pay already paid by sub-
      mitting the appropriate collection transactions. See Table 35.1. for the A21 format.
      35.2.3.5. See Chapter 32, “Accounts Receivable – Debt Accounts” for collections within IAS
      and Chapter 43, “DFAS-DE Unique Transactions – D01, D02, and PDS” for collections outside
      IAS.
   35.2.4. DFAS-DE/FJP.
      35.2.4.1. Contacts the appropriate RC payroll office requesting a waiver be submitted by the
      member.
      35.2.4.2. Establishes a 60 day suspense.
      35.2.4.3. After suspense period, reviews MMPA for the waiver indicator.
      35.2.4.4. If the waiver indicator is on record, advises DFAS-DE/FR of the number of Reserve pay
      days for adjustment to retired pay, then closes case.
      35.2.4.5. If the waiver indicator is not on record, contacts DFAS-DE/FR to ensure the member is
      drawing dual compensation. If so, advises the RC payroll office to prepare an A21 transaction to
      stop Reserve pay, and start collection action of all Reserve pay and allowances paid while in a dual
      compensation status.

35.3. Waiver of Veterans Administration (VA) Compensation.
   35.3.1. The member completes a one time waiver of VA benefits on VA Form 21-8951, Declaration
   of Benefits Received and Waivers. The member marks block “B” in Section 7, signs the form and sub-
   mits the original to the VA.
   35.3.2. Each quarter, DFAS-DE sends a tape of all Reserve members who were paid during the quar-
   ter (along with the number of days and/or periods each was paid) to the Defense Manpower Data Cen-
   ter (DMDC). The DMDC matches data with the VA files.
   35.3.3. If a waiver is on file, VA makes appropriate deductions to VA compensation during the fol-
   lowing quarters.
   35.3.4. If a waiver is not on file, VA contacts the member to fill out VA Form 21-8951.

35.4. Waiver of Reserve Pay and Allowances. The RC Payroll Office:
   35.4.1. Completes section IV of AF Form 1962; 360 days are waived for each fiscal year.
   35.4.2. Obtains member’s signature and certifies AF Form 1962 by signing in the “verified by” block.
   35.4.3. Prepares and submits an A21 transaction (see Table 35.1. for the A21 format) on the first
   update of each fiscal year, or when status changes.
   35.4.4. Attaches original AF Form 1962 to the input list as a supporting document. Retains a copy in
   the supporting document file until superseded, then destroys the file copy.

              PERSONNEL DATA SYSTEM AND DJMS-RC FILE RECONCILIATION

39.1. Discrepancies Between Personnel Data System (PDS) and DJMS-RC.
      39.1.1. Purpose. On a semi-annual basis, ARPC provides listings of incompatible data elements con-
      tained in PDS master personnel records compared with the same data elements in DJMS-RC MMPAs.
      Master listings are provided to ANGRC; copies are distributed to the appropriate OPR. Exception: all
      ARPC copies are sent to ARPC/SCQ for further disposition.
      39.1.2. Description of Reports.
         39.1.2.1. UH022-600, Part 1, PDS Record on File – No Matching JUMPS-RF Record. Lists mis-
         matches on name, grade, CBPO, PAS, and date record was established on PDS.
         39.1.2.2. UH022-600, Part 2, JUMPS-RF Record on File – No Matching PDS Record. Lists mis-
         matches on name, grade, DJMS-RC PAS, and date record was gained in DJMS-RC.
         39.1.2.3. UH022-602, Salary Offset – Members in Loss Status/ Unselected Members. A listing of
         repeat errors that were previously reported on UH022-600 and are still in error on a succeeding
         reconciliation. These are priority items to be cleared immediately.
         39.1.2.4. UH022-604, Name Grade (Enl Only) PAS. Lists mismatches on name, grade, and effec-
         tive date of grade in DJMS-RC and PDS.
         39.1.2.5. UH022-605, Bonus. Lists records which reflect bonus is payable in PDS or DJMS-RC,
         but not both.
         39.1.2.6. UH022-606, PDS Paydate, OSD, ASD. Lists mismatches on paydate, officer service
         date (OSD), and aviation service date (ASD).
         39.1.2.7. UH022-607, PDS Officer Grade, Effective Date. Lists mismatches on officer pay grade
         and effective date between PDS and DJMS-RC.

39.2. RC Payroll Office Procedures.
      39.2.1. UH022-600, Part 1 See 39.1.2.1., “UH022-600, Part 1, PDS Record on File – No Matching
      JUMPS-RF Record”.
         39.2.1.1. A PDS master personnel record SSN does not match up with a DJMS-RC MMPA SSN.
         Probable cause is that a member has been gained in PDS but not in DJMS-RC.
             39.2.1.1.1. If the record is a recent gain, monitor DJMS-RC for gain data. If PDS record is
             over two (2) weeks old, contact CBPO to validate gain.
             39.2.1.1.2. If correct, the RC payroll office sends a message to DFAS-DE/FJP requesting
             accession, then inputs the A06, A07, and A08 transaction to complete the DJMS-RC MMPA
             gain. See Table 2.6., Table 2.7., and Table 2.8., respectively, for the A06, A07, and A08 for-
             mats
      39.2.2. UH022-600, Part 2. See 39.1.2.2., “UH022-600, Part 2, JUMPS-RF Record on File – No
      Matching PDS Record”.
         39.2.2.1. A DJMS-RC MMPA SSN does not match a PDS master personnel record SSN.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           547


          39.2.2.1.1. Probable cause is that a member was lost to PDS but was reopened for additional
          adjustments.
          39.2.2.1.2. If DOS is not present on the DJMS-RC MMPA and member is already lost to the
          PDS system, the RC payroll office submits a message to DFAS-DE/FJP giving the date of sep-
          aration and requesting a 900 transaction be processed.
   39.2.3. UH022-604. See 39.1.2.4., “UH022-604, Name Grade (ENL Only) PAS”.
      39.2.3.1. PDS and DJMS-RC show a different name, grade (or effective date of grade), and/or
      PAS for enlisted personnel.
          39.2.3.1.1. For name, the difference may simply be a spelling error, middle name versus ini-
          tial, or addition of suffix such as “Jr”.
          39.2.3.1.2. Grade or effective date of grade requires research on promotion list, and PAS may
          be incorrect because of a transfer.
   39.2.4. UH022-605. See 39.1.2.5., “UH022-605, Bonus”. Bonus code does not appear on both PDS
   and DJMS-RC. Research appropriate correction with CBPO.
   39.2.5. UH022-606. See 39.1.2.6., “UH022-606, PDS Paydate, OSD, ASD”. Data on various pay
   dates may be missing or conflicting. Research appropriate correction with CBPO.
   39.2.6. UH022-607. See 39.1.2.7., “UH022-607, PDS Officer Grade, Effective Date”. Grade or effec-
   tive date of grade for officers differs between PDS and DJMS-RC. Check promotion orders and cor-
   rect accordingly.

39.3. Document Disposition.
   39.3.1. AFRES. Annotates the corrected listing with the action taken and return the original to HQ
   AFRES/FM, Robins AFB, GA 31098-5000.

      products’ return with corrective action annotated.
      39.3.3.2. The OPR reconciles the data elements and prepares input to PDS or DJMS-RC for cor-
      rective action on the master record(s).
      39.3.3.3. After clearing the suspense with SCQ, the OPR retains a copy of the listing until the next
      reconciliation is received, then destroys.

41.7. Section G – Accounting Processing Code (APC) Guidance.
      41.7.1. Definition of APC.
         41.7.1.1. The Accounting Processing Code is a six digit code which replaces the project/sub-
         project, as well as some other data fields, such as training category code (TCC) and fund cite indi-
         cator (FCI) in transactions used in DJMS-RC processing.
         41.7.1.2. The component of pay codes will be required in certain TINs in conjunction with the
         APC.
         41.7.1.3. If unsure which APC to use, contact the support center for guidance.
      41.7.2. APC On-Line Inquiry. On-line inquiry of APCs is available through CICSJ3 and the PGRM
      Option. See 6.6.3., “Access to PGRM”, 6.6.4., “Options within the Accounting Processing (APC)
      Inquiry Master Menu”, and Table 6.1. for more information.
      41.7.3. APC Structure. The APC structure is different for Air National Guard, MPA (3500) funds and
      Air Force Reserves.
         41.7.3.1. Air National Guard APC Structure.
             41.7.3.1.1. Position 1-2: CBPO
             41.7.3.1.2. Position 3: Project Code Identifier
             41.7.3.1.3. Position 4: Subproject Code Identifier
             41.7.3.1.4. Position 5-6: TCC (see Appendix F, “USAFR Training Category Codes” and Table
             F-1).
         41.7.3.2. Air Force Reserves APC Structure.
             41.7.3.2.1. Position 1-3: Organizational code
             41.7.3.2.2. Position 4: E, numeric value or 0 (numeric zero)
             41.7.3.2.3. Position 5-6: TCC if position is zero or E; or Subproject (see Appendix F,
             “USAFR Training Category Codes” and Table F-1).

         41.7.3.3.1. Position 1: 3.
         41.7.3.3.2. Position 2-4: SAFID ID/Summary Account Code equivalent.
         41.7.3.3.3. Position 5-6: TCC (see Appendix F, “USAFR Training Category Codes” and Table
         F-1).
  41.7.4. APC Tables. Table 40. The primary APC table is Table 40. It contains APC, date groups, and
  accounting classification data.
     41.7.4.1. The change codes (I, C, A, and D) are on Table 40 for an audit trail, so the user can fol-
     low what was done to the APC, the dates involved, and the last time it was accessed. The change
     codes are not intended to be a programming aid to validate APC dates. The subtables contain the
     APC, dates and accounting classification. The APC subtables are:
         41.7.4.1.1. Air Force Reserves – Subtable 01
         41.7.4.1.2. Air National Guard – Subtable 03
         41.7.4.1.3. Air Force MPA (3500) Funds – Subtable 15
         41.7.4.1.4. Component of Pay/SAF-ID/EOR Conversion Table – Subtable 13
         41.7.4.1.5. DoD Appropriations – Subtable 09
         41.7.4.1.6. Retired Pay, Accrual APC Conversion Table RETAPC
     41.7.4.2. APC Structure – Differences Between AFR, ANG, and Army. The structure of the APCs
     is somewhat different between the Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and the Army. Some
     examples are shown on Table 41.1.
  41.7.5. Primary or Base Pay APCs. The APC used in the transactions listed in Table 40 will be the pri-
  mary or base pay APC for the specific type duty the member has performed. For example, if a Air
  National Guard officer assigned to Buckley ANG is on active duty for Training, and is in pay group A
  and is in training category code (TCC) AA, the ANG APC that would be used in the active duty trans-
  action (TIN) B6A1AA.
     41.7.5.1. Non-duty entitlement APCs, such as disability pay and clothing allowance, will not be
     derived. These APCs will be the actual APC for the entitlement and not a base pay APC.
     41.7.5.2. Transactions Containing APCs. The following listed TINs contain APCs. Most of these
     TINs will be recorded5 on History File 1 (HF1). Subsequent entitlements and collection APCs
     (such as those listed in 41.7.5.2., “Transactions Using APCs Derived from a Previous TIN”) will
     be obtained from these APCs on HF1.

         41.7.5.3. Transactions Using APCs Derived from a Previous TIN. The TINs that will not contain
         APCs, but will have APCs derived for accounting purposes are:


                B03 B12 B13
                C02 C03 C04 C05 C11


      41.7.6. Air Force MPA Fund APCs.
         41.7.6.1. Use the following APCs:
            41.7.6.1.1. Officer Base Pay: 3011ZZ
            41.7.6.1.2. Enlisted Base Pay: 3603ZZ
                41.7.6.1.2.1. The “ZZ” in the APC shown above will be replaced with the actual training
                category code for that member. For an officer in TCC “TT,” the APC would be 3011TT.
                41.7.6.1.2.2. Since there are TCCs for all MPA duty, a valid TCC will be required in the
                APC. See Appendix G, “MPA Training Category Codes.”
         41.7.6.2. APC Edits and Validations.
            41.7.6.2.1. The APCs will be validated on Table 40. The match will be on APC and dates
            against the date groups on Table 40.
            41.7.6.2.2. If the APC TIN dates do not fall within a date group on Table 40, it will reject, with
            an error message 0354, “APC IS NOT VALID FOR GIVEN DATE(S)”.
            41.7.6.2.3. If the APC used in the transaction has no match on the APC Table 40, it will reject,
            with error message 0343, “APC IS INVALID”.
            41.7.6.2.4. A DR debt must contain an APC from Subtable 09, the DoD Appropriations Sub-
            table.
            41.7.6.2.5. An edit exists in the DJMS-RC system between APCS and PAS codes. The edit
            checks a members PAS code and whether or not the APC is open to specific PAS. Basically,
            Guard members are not paid from Reserve APCs and Reserve members are not paid from
            Guard APCs. If the error message “APC DOES NOT MATCH PAS” is received, then check
            the PAS of the member. If the member has recently changed from being a Guard member to a
            Reservist or vice versa, submit an A09 transaction to place them in the correct PAS and then
            resubmit the original transaction.

                                               Chapter 43

                   DFAS-DE UNIQUE TRANSACTIONS – D01, D02, AND PDS

43.1. Purpose.
   43.1.1. This chapter provides formats and instructions in the use of unique transactions, personnel
   transactions, and Lackland Air Force Base transactions.
   43.1.2. Unique transactions are used to pay, collect, or adjust pay and allowances outside immediate
   access storage (IAS); pay, collect, or adjust non-automated entitlements, both within and outside IAS;
   and pay, collect of adjust disability payments both inside or outside IAS.
   43.1.3. Certain unique transactions, action indicators and components of pay are restricted to central
   site, but most are available for use by the payroll offices. Personnel and Lackland transactions are
   restricted to central site for resubmission of rejects; however, the formats are included for your infor-
   mation.

43.2. Quality Assurance Audit Procedures for Processing D02 Transactions.
   43.2.1. RC payroll offices are required to establish a quality assurance program to ensure computa-
   tions of pay and allowances are accomplished in accordance with regulatory guidance. Input sources
   are responsible for monitoring the use of generic components of pay (COPS IS, IT and W7) and estab-
   lishing standards for how often the generic cops will be monitored as well as procedures for reporting
   continued misuse of the generic COPS. Input sources are responsible for ensuring a TIN D18, mes-
   sage transaction, is input when a generic COP is used on a D02 transaction. The D18 must identify the
   purpose of the generic COP.
   43.2.2. These procedures should include, but are not limited to, a pre-audit of pay computations and
   transactions prior to submission for payment into the DJMS-RC pay system, procedures for control-
   ling and sorting supporting documents for all payments, and random post-audits of pay records to pre-
   vent erroneous payments.
   43.2.3. DFAS-DE/FJP will conduct random audits of D02 payments to ensure computations are cor-
   rect. Payroll offices may be asked to furnish supporting documents to support payments made.

43.3. D01 Procedures for Adjustments to Inactive Duty.
   43.3.1. The D01 transactions are used to adjust basic and incentive pay for inactive duty outside IAS,
   adjust FITW, SITW, and FICA tax fields for current year, and to make FITW refunds for current year.
   Tax adjustments and refunds are restricted to central site. Payroll offices may use the D01 transaction
   for inactive duty adjustments outside IAS. A separate D01 must be used for each entitlement and for
   each month of performance. B12 and B13 transactions are to be used for adjustments inside IAS. (See
   Table 32.2. and Table 27.3. for the B12 and B13 transaction formats).
   43.3.2. Non-automated entitlements within IAS, e.g., dual incentive pays and special pays must be
   paid using the D02 transaction with a pseudo components of pay (COP). See Table 43.4. and Table
   43.5. for the D01 transaction formats.
   43.3.3. Gross amount entered in the D01 transaction will be divided by total days derived by subtract-
   ing the start date from the stop date and adding one. This rate will be compared to the current FELS
576                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      maximum rate table when a D01 contains an action indicator of A or B. If the computed daily rate
      exceeds the maximum daily rate on the table, the transaction will be rejected to the FELS error report,
      UH022-205. This report may be found in the Sysout Archive and Retrieval System (SAR) under dis-
      tribution ID JFRFLD1. The report ID number in SAR is FR0205DF.

43.4. Changes to D02 Procedures.
      43.4.1. The D02 transaction has been changed for ease of use by both the field and central site. One
      input transaction format is used for all types of pay and adjustments (see Table 43.3.). A separate
      transaction must be used for each entitlement and for each month of adjustment.
      43.4.2. Components of pay (COP) and action indicators (AI) in the transaction are used to determine
      the type of payment or adjustment transaction which will be generated (see Table 43.12.).
      43.4.3. Generated Transactions will appear on processed transaction history; rejects will be returned
      to the input source for research and resubmission as necessary in the same format as it entered the
      update.
      43.4.4. The D02 will make for adjustments for:
         43.4.4.1. Any pay for which the dates of performance are outside IAS,
         43.4.4.2. Incapacitation pay (Line Of Duty (LOD)) within and outside IAS, and
         43.4.4.3. Adjustments and payment of SAVE PAY within and outside IAS.
         43.4.4.4. Gross amount entered in the D02 transaction will be divided by total days derived by
         subtracting the start date from the stop date and adding one. This rate will be compared to the cur-
         rent FELS maximum rate table when a D02 contains an action indicator of A or B. If the computed
         daily rate exceeds the maximum daily rate on the table, the transaction will reject to the FELS
         error report, UH022-205, this report may be found in SAR under distribution ID JFRFLD1. The
         report ID number in SAR is FR0205DF.
      43.4.5. Adjustments Outside of IAS.
         43.4.5.1. The D02 may be used to make adjustments outside of IAS. When this revised D02 pro-
         cesses, the COP will determine which “old” active duty D TIN will be generated for processing
         through the system. The AI tells the computer what to do in conjunction with the COP (see Table
         43.12.).
         43.4.5.2. Adjustments inside IAS with the exception of non-automated entitlements will be made
         using the C03, C04, and C05 transactions. (See Table 32.3., Table 27.4., and Table 27.5., respec-
         tively, for the C03, C04, and C05 transaction formats.)
      43.4.6. Non-Automated Adjustments Inside/Outside IAS. D02 transactions will be used to make pay-
      ments both inside and outside IAS for non-automated adjustments., e.g., dual incentive pays, or spe-
      cial pays. This applies to both active and inactive duty. Active duty will be paid using the appropriate
      COP and will require a value of 50 in the calendar. Pseudo COP “IT” will be used for inactive duty.
      43.4.7. Incapacitation Pay.
         43.4.7.1. Incapacitation pay will be paid on D02 transactions after computation is complete.
         43.4.7.2. Use DUTY TYPE “1” (one) to indicate this is for incapacitation pay. The DUTY TYPE
         indicator tells the computer what to do in conjunction with the COP (see Table 43.26.).
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             577


      43.4.7.3. The member’s calendar will be updated with a value of 10 for each day the entitlements
      is paid. Basic pay must be posted before the additional entitlements can be paid. It is not necessary
      to hold the D02 transactions for additional entitlements when submitting the D02 transaction for
      basic pay, because the computer-generated transactions will post and pay in the appropriate
      sequence.
      43.4.7.4. Data is transmitted to the Point Credit Accounting System (PCARS) to preclude the
      member receiving points for the period he/she is incapacitated.
      43.4.7.5. Taxes are computed automatically when payments are made.
   43.4.8. Save Pay.
      43.4.8.1. A member may be entitled to Save Pay when an enlisted member is promoted to warrant
      officer or commissioned as an officer, and his/her enlisted or previous grade’s pay is more than
      his/her current grade. The difference between the two is paid to the member.
      43.4.8.2. The payroll office should flag the member’s file so a manual comparison of current and
      first prior pay rates may be accomplished. This will be done for each payment made until a lon-
      gevity increase, mass rate, or another promotion affecting the difference between the two rates
      pushes the current rate to more than the first prior. Payment will be made using the following
      COPs:


              A9 – Save Pay Base Pay
              AA – Save Pay Allowances
              AB – Save Pay Incentive Pay


      43.4.8.3. A separate D02 is required for each month.
   43.4.9. Reservists’ Special Separation Pay (RSSP)/Reservists’ Involuntary Separation Pay (RISP) –
   Central Site Processing Only
      43.4.9.1. RSSP and RISP programs were effective in March 1993.
      43.4.9.2. All payments are made at central site, using the D02 transaction format. The D02 input
      transaction converts to a D13 output transaction.
      43.4.9.3. The following COPs are used: AP – RSSP; AQ – RISP.
      43.4.9.4. Payment is made upon receipt of legitimate orders from the ARPC, stating the member
      is entitled to RSSP or RISP. The initial payment is made by DFAS-DE/FJPA. For RSSP, any future
      payments are made by DFAS-Cleveland.

43.5. D17 Procedures for Accrued Leave Adjustments.
   43.5.1. Adjustments to accrued leave are restricted to central site. D17 transactions are used to collect
   payments of accrued leave within IAS and to pay, adjust, and collect payments of accrued leave out-
   side IAS. See Table 43.27. for the D17 transaction format.
578                                                              AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      43.5.2. ADJ-AMT is divided by ADJ-NO-DAYS to obtain a daily rate. This rate is compared to the
      current FELS MAX rate table. If the rate input (contained) in the transaction exceeds the maximum
      daily rate allowable, the A32 rejects with error message “DAILY RATE EXCEEDS THE MAXI-
      MUM DAILY RATE”. This reject appears on the FELS error report, UH022-205. This report may be
      found in SAR under distribution ID JFRFLD1. The report ID number in SAR is FR0205DF.

43.6. D18 Message Transaction Procedures. The D18 transaction is used to add information, such as
an audit trail, or to explain an action being taken. A D18 will be input when a generic component of pay
(COPS IS, IT or W7) is used on a D02 transaction. The D18 must identify the purpose of the generic COP.
The D18 posts to the member’s MMPA and provides an audit trail for generic COPS. It does not print on
the member’s LES. See Table 43.28. for the D18 transaction format.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                    579

                                                  Chapter 44

       WAIVER OF CLAIMS FOR ERRONEOUS PAYMENT OF PAY AND ALLOWANCES

44.1. Purpose. This chapter contains procedures and instructions for processing applications for waiver
of claims of the United States against Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members.

44.2. Waiver Standards and Considerations.
      44.2.1. Authority.
         44.2.1.1. Authority given in 10 U.S.C. 2774 and 32 U.S.C. 716 provides for waiver of claims of
         the United States against a member arising out of an erroneous payment of pay and allowances if
         recovery is determined to be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the
         United States.
         44.2.1.2. Generally, these criteria will be met by a finding that an erroneous payment occurred
         through administrative error and that there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or
         lack of good faith on the part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a
         waiver of the claim.
      44.2.2. Timeliness of Waiver Application.
         44.2.2.1. The office of the Comptroller General or the department concerned must receive the
         application for waiver within three (3) years from the date the erroneous payment was discovered.
         Date of discovery, for purposes of starting the 3-year period, is the date that an erroneous payment
         is confirmed by the payroll office or DFAS-DE, as appropriate.
         44.2.2.2. The member must apply for refund of amounts collected within two (2) years from the
         date of waiver approval.

44.3. In-Service Members.
      44.3.1. Member Procedures.
         44.3.1.1. Completes AF Form 1782, Application for Waiver of Erroneous Payments, Section I
         (see Figure 44.1.) furnishing all information requested, including negative replies. Failure to fur-
         nish complete and accurate details may cause the application to be returned and delay waiver
         action.
         44.3.1.2. Upon completion, sends the application to the servicing RC payroll office.
      44.3.2. RC Payroll Office Procedures.
         44.3.2.1. Reviews entries in Section I of AF Form 1782. Clarifies any discrepancies and com-
         pletes Section II of AF Form 1782 to include information and documentation to support the claim.
         44.3.2.2. Documentation should include copies of:
             44.3.2.2.1. Debt letter to the member, DD Form 114, or DD Form 139.
             44.3.2.2.2. Air Force/Army Leave and Earnings Statement (Active and Reserve Forces), or
             pay histories; and
             44.3.2.2.3. Pay analysis or debt computation.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                           611


      44.3.2.3. If the required documentation cannot be furnished, a reasonable explanation, including
      reason for overpayment and inclusive dates for the entire period of overpayment, must be pro-
      vided.
      44.3.2.4. The RC payroll office may reduce the amount of payment per pay period if the normal
      collection schedule would cause undue hardship on the member; however, only DFAS-DE/
      FYCTA may authorize suspension of the debt.
      44.3.2.5. DFAS-DE may approve suspending the debt when the facts show that:
         44.3.2.5.1. A waiver will probably be granted.
         44.3.2.5.2. Erroneous payment can be recovered if the waiver is not granted.
         44.3.2.5.3. Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship.
      44.3.2.6. When Section II of AF Form 1782 is completed, transmits the application with support-
      ing documentation in original and one copy to DFAS-DE/FYCTA, Denver, CO 80279-5000.
      Includes DJMS-RC and first two digits of the CBPO PAS code on all documents.
      44.3.2.7. Keeps a complete copy of waiver package on file.
   44.3.3. DFAS-DE/FYCTA Case Processing.
      44.3.3.1. Reviews the case for completeness of data. If additional data is required, requests infor-
      mation or documentation from the RC payroll office.
      44.3.3.2. Refers case to final action authority.
         44.3.3.2.1. DFAS-DE/FYC has the authority to waive, in whole or in part, requests up to and
         including $1,500.
         44.3.3.2.2. DFAS-DE/FY has the authority to deny claims of any amount and will rule on all
         special interest (e.g., group claims, general officer, congressional interest) cases.
         44.3.3.2.3. Upon receipt of final determination, advises the RC payroll office and issues DD
         Form 139 to DFAS-DE/FJP, if appropriate.
         44.3.3.2.4. The DD Form 139 authorizes refund of a collection if a claim for refund is
         included in the request for waiver and refund is due for an amount waived.
         44.3.3.2.5. If request for waiver is for Line of Duty (LOD) indebtedness and the payment and
         indebtedness were incurred after November 1986, then forward DD Form 139 to DFAS-DE/
         FJPR for adjustment.

44.4. Out-of-Service Members.
   44.4.1. Member Procedures. Follows the same procedures in 44.3.1., “Member Procedures”, except
   complete AFAFC Form 2348, Application for Waiver, and sends the application to DFAS-DE/
   FYCTA, 6760 E. Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-5000.
   44.4.2. DFAS-DE/FYCT Procedures.

      44.4.2.3. Upon receipt of final determination by DFAS-DE/FYCT or GAO, advises DFAS-DE/
      FYDC to inform member of the waiver decision and to continue out-of-service collection proce-
      dures, if appropriate.

tary Pay System – Active Component (DJMS-AC) are located in AFMAN 65-116 Volume 1, Chapter 62
or the Army’s Military Pay Procedures Manual (MPPM).
NOTE: For entitlement information on the savings deposit program, refer to DoDFMR, Volume 7A,
Chapter 51.

45.2. Substantiating Documents. For cash or check collections, prepare a DD Form 1131, Cash Collec-

      above. The voucher will have the appropriate voucher prefix. Include the appropriate voucher prefix
      and type ‘SDP, Member Paid by DJMS-RC’ in the description column and the date of deposit in the
      “Date Received Subject to Collection” block and in the “Date Received” column of DD Form 1131.

      If the member makes a deposit with a personal check, the check must be made payable to the Defense
      Accounting Officer (DAO). Advise the member to maintain his or her copy of every SDP cash collec-
      tion voucher.
         45.3.1.1. FSOs will then pass collection information to DFAS-DE/FJPR.
         45.3.1.2. Air Force FSOs will process the collection into the General Accounting and Finance
         System (GAFS), Merged Accountability and Fund Reporting (MAFR), as a for-others collection.

       will input a D18 memo entry on the member’s reserve component pay record which states ‘SDP
       DEPOSIT, VDATE******, CP***, $AMOUNT’. NOTE: ‘Vdate’ is the collection voucher date
       in the accounting records at the FSO. ‘CP’ is the collection voucher prefix for a collection origi-
       nating in military pay.
       45.3.2.2. DFAS-DE/FJFAB will enter the collection voucher data into a locally devised spread-
       sheet. The spreadsheet must have, as a minimum, the member’s full name, SSN, amount, and
       month of entitlement.
          45.3.2.2.1. FJFAB will consolidate the information, i.e., copies of the DD Form 1131 and the
          spreadsheet of each month’s collections, and send to DFAS-CL. (See paragraph 45.4.2.A).
          45.3.2.2.2. Retention. DFAS-DE/FJFAB will maintain copies of all documents forwarded to
          DFAS-CL for a period which is defined as ’56 Years After Last Account is Closed’. Reference
          AFMAN 37-139; the authority for this retention is contained in NI-AFU-90-3.
   45.3.3. DFAS-CL.DFAS-CL will maintain the SDP record for all service members, calculate interest,
   and make refunds and interest payments to participating members.

45.4. Special Provisions.

   principal and interest on deposit reaches $10,000, amounts representing interest accruing in the
   account subsequent to that time, which cause the $10,000 total to be exceeded, may be withdrawn
   quarterly at the member’s request. Reference paragraph 45.4.3., “Procedures for Making Withdraw-
   als”.
   45.4.2. Final Settlement of SDP Accounts. Final settlement of amounts deposited into SDP is made
   only by DFAS-CL. DFAS-CL maintains SDP records for members of all the services and makes pay-
   ments to those members. Request for payment must be submitted in writing to DFAS-CL. See para-
   graph 45.4.2.1.
       45.4.2.1. To expedite payment, send request either by fax or message.

            plus interest will be repaid upon member’s written request.
            45.4.2.2.2. When an eligible member has an SDP account and the member is discharged over-
            seas (not for reentry into the service), all deposits plus interest will be repaid upon member’s

            commission, may not withdraw their deposits.
            45.4.2.2.3. When an eligible member has an SDP account and the member is in a missing sta-
            tus, all deposits plus interest will be repaid upon direction of the Secretary concerned or their
            designee.
            45.4.2.2.4. When an eligible member who has an SDP dies, all deposits plus interest will be
            paid upon settlement of member’s unpaid pay and allowances as provided in the DoDFMR,

      45.4.3. Procedures for Making Withdrawals.
         45.4.3.1. Emergency Withdrawals. Withdrawals may be made only in an emergency when the
         health or welfare of a member or dependent(s) would be jeopardized if the withdrawal was not
         granted. Emergency withdrawals may be authorized by the member’s commanding officer.
            45.4.3.1.1. Member must submit a written application for emergency withdrawal to their com-
            mander specifying the reason for the emergency withdrawal, and the amount of money
            needed, as well as, information on where the payment should be sent.
            45.4.3.1.2. The commander must be assured of the validity of the reason for an emergency
            withdrawal request. Based on those findings, the request is approved or disapproved. If disap-
            proved, the commander returns the request to the member. If approved, the written request is
            forwarded to the FSO or agent who then submits the request to DFAS-CL.
                45.4.3.1.2.1. The written request must include the SSN, branch of service, and amount
                requested (which may be part of or the entire balance). The request must also provide pay-
                ment delivery information including account number, type of account (checking or sav-
                ings) and the routing transit number (RTN) from Table 50 if the payment is to be sent
                electronic fund transfer (EFT).
                45.4.3.1.2.2. Also, annotate on the request that it is an emergency request and that the
                request has been approved by the member’s commander. The EFT method of payment is
                strongly encouraged to avoid non-receipt or lost or stolen checks.
NOTE: Before processing any refund, make certain that the member does, in fact, have funds with
DFAS-CL to be refunded. The FSO must contact DFAS-CL by fax, phone call, or message, and verify that
the member has funds available for withdrawal. See paragraph 45.4.2.A unless DFAS-CL has a record of
a deposit, no withdrawal is authorized.
            45.4.3.1.3. In an extreme emergency where the money is needed by the member at the military
            site, contact DFAS-CL to determine if the member has funds available for withdrawal. If so,
            request authority from DFAS-CL to make the payment locally at the FSO. The accounting

        classification to be cited is listed in paragraph 45.2. The FSO must send DFAS-CL the pay-
        ment date, payment amount, and voucher number via message.
     45.4.3.2. Payments to Guard and Reserve Members (Other than Emergency Withdrawals). FSO
     or agent submits a request in writing to DFAS-CL specifying member’s name, SSN, branch of ser-
     vice, and amount requested. If payment is to be made by check from DFAS-CL, provide the
     address to which the check should be sent. If the member wants to be paid by EFT, provide the
     member’s account number, type of account (checking or savings), and RTN from Table 50. Indi-
     cate the reason for request (i.e., to close out account because 90-day period is over; or to close out
     account because member is no longer in eligible area; or to withdraw interest only from an account
     over $10,000. etc). FSO or agent ensures that member’s SSN provided to DFAS-CL is valid and
     that the member has met the withdrawal requirements.
     45.4.3.3. Payment of Separated Members. Member will submit a signed, written request for pay-
     ment to DFAS-CL, including the following information: name, SSN, branch of service, payment
     delivery information, and a statement that the member is separated.

46.1. Description. This chapter provides guidance for Guard and Reserve payroll office (RPO) input of
JUMPS data collection transactions for Guard and Reserve members paid by the Defense Joint Military
Pay System – Active Component (DJMS-AC).

46.2. Substantiating Documents. RPO substantiating documents supporting JDC III input must be pro-
cessed in accordance with AFI 37-139. (AFI 37-139 is scheduled to be replaced by DFAS AI No. 1,
Schedule 7340).

            46.3.1.1.1. Cycle Numbers. Unless otherwise directed by a unit’s support center, JDC cycle
            numbers are sequentially assigned by the user for each day’s input. The numbers are
            alpha-numeric and begin with A1 through Z9, with the exception of X1-X9. Cycle number
            X1-X9 may not be used. After Z9, the cycle numbering sequence may begin again.
            46.3.1.1.2. ADSN. The ADSN that will be keyed in for the update will be the first two posi-
            tions of the Consolidated Base Personnel Office (CBPO) and two zeros. For example, the

                                               Chapter 48

                TRICARE SELECTED RESERVE DENTAL PROGRAM (TSRDP)

48.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide information on the implementation of a com-
pletely new program in DJMS-RC, the Tricare Selected Reserve Dental Program (TSRDP).

48.2. Applicability And Scope. TSRDP is a dental program for all members of the selected reserves.
The program is for reservists only; member’s dependents are not covered under the program.

48.3. Policy. Policy for this program is contained in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A.

48.4. Responsibilities and Procedures. Reserve payroll offices have very minimal responsibilities in
this program. Enrollments and disenrollments will be the responsibility of the dental contractor. The pro-
gram will be handled systematically as follows: the dental contractor will transmit a data file, to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), of all eligible reservists who have enrolled in TSRDP and are
anticipating a monthly deduction from their DJMS-RC pay. DMDC will perform a file comparison with
DEERS and will electronically send the positive matches to DFAS-DE. DFAS-DE will then compare the
file to the DJMS-RC, a DJMS-RC TIN DV03 deduction will be created for each member and placed on
the member’s debt master record. (Each monthly the DV03 deduction will be created for one month’s
deduction amount only and will not be cumulative). If the member is paid during the monthly pay cycle,
and there are funds available in the full amount of the DV03, the TSRDP premium will be withheld from
the member’s net pay and properly recorded on the member’s LES. If the member is not paid during the
monthly pay cycle or does not have sufficient funds available to cover the deduction, a notification will be
provided to the contractor and it is the contractor’s responsibility to collect from the member directly.
Units are not permitted to submit a DV07 or DV09 adjusting or canceling the Tricare premium deduction.
The only method to stop the premium deduction is to have the member’s name removed from the file
being sent from the dental contractor to the DMDC. This process will be repeated monthly. The contractor
is responsible for answering any questions the member may have regarding these deductions and any
refunds from overpayment of premiums must be made by the contractor.

48.5. Reports. Two SAR reports are being made available for Reserve pay offices to use if members ask
the status of their TSRDP deductions. The no match report (titled “TRICARE DENTAL NO MATCH
FILE TO DMDC” and numbered PCN: UH022-617) will show the records with no match in DJMS-RC
from the DMDC eligibility file. The deduction report (titled “DEDUCTION FILE TO DMDC” and num-
bered PCN: UH022-618) will contain the information in the deduction file.

                      LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM (LTCIP)

49.1. Description. Long term care insurance is a congressionally mandated program established to pro-
vide long term care insurance for military members and their families. This program becomes effective
October 1, 2002 for military members. Long term care insurance is not a government insurance. It is a pri-
vate long term care insurance offered to military members and their dependents by the long term care
(LTC) partners (which consists of John Hancock and Metropolitan Life).

49.2. Source Of Input. LTC partners is the contracted provider for long term care insurance. LTC part-
ners processes all collections using a DV debt to company code N904439. There is no FSO input. LTC
partners handles all rejects or inquiries related to the program. Instruct military members to call LTC part-
ners at 1-800-582-3337 with any questions or for new enrollments. The web site for LTC partners is:
HTTP://WWW.LTCFEDS.COM.

49.3. Other Information: If for three months in a row, the LTC premium cannot be collected because
there is not enough pay, the debt will automatically be cancelled on the pay record and the member will be
billed directly by LTC partners.

49.4. LES remarks: An LES remark will indicate when the premium is collected. The remark will be
“LTC premium questions? Call LTC partners at 1-800 LTC FEDS. If the LTC premium is not collected by
code 3, the remark “non-collection of LTC premium” will appear in the remarks section of the code 3
LES.

50.3. Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Overview. The TSP is a retirement savings and investment plan estab-
lished for federal employees as part of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986. Participa-
tion in the plan for uniformed service members is authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act
FY 2000 as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act FY 2001. The plan offers tax deferred
advantages similar to those in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or 401(k) plan. The Federal
Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) administers the plan and publishes regulations and operat-
ing guidance. The National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, Louisiana is the TSP record keeper.

50.4. Eligibility to Participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).
   50.4.1. Any member of the uniformed services serving on active duty and any member of the ready
   reserve in any pay status may participate in the UNISERV TSP in accordance with 5, U.S.C. 8440e.
   50.4.2. A member of the reserve component (Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve) who is also a
   federal civilian employee will have two TSP accounts if participating in the TSP as a military member
   and a civilian.

50.5. Initial/Open Seasons.
   50.5.1. Any eligible member may elect to participate in the plan and does so by completing the
   TSP-U-1 form and taking it to the finance office for processing. A special open season (sometimes
   referred to as the initial open season) for the UNISERV TSP began October 9, 2001 and ends Decem-
   ber 8, 2001. This special open season partially falls within the regular (normal) open season of
624                                                                   AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      November 15 through January 31, 2002; therefore, members may elect to enroll through January 31,
      2002.
      50.5.2. Contributions based on elections made on or before December 31, 2001 will be deducted from
      pay the first full pay period of January in calendar year 2002. Elections made in January 2002 will be
      effective in February 2002.
      50.5.3. Members who do not enroll during the initial special open season will have two open seasons
      each year to enroll. These open season dates are established by the FRTIB and run from May 15 thru
      July 31 and November 15 thru January 31. Contributions from these open seasons may not begin
      before the last full month of the open season, which is referred to as the election period. Example:
      member enrolls in TSP on May 16, 2003, contributions may not be deducted from the member’s pay
      until his/her first payday in July 2003.
      50.5.4. For information on establishing effective dates, see paragraph 50.21.2.

50.6. Member Transfers.
      50.6.1. New members accessed on and after 9 Oct 01, including those with a break in service, may
      elect to enroll in the TSP within 60 days after joining. A member is considered to have joined the uni-
      formed service on the date the member becomes eligible to receive basic pay or compensation under
      section 206 of Title 37. If a member decides to begin participation during this 60-day period, the first
      contribution must be taken the first full pay period after the election is received by the finance office.
      No contributions will be taken prior to January 1, 2002. New members, who do not enroll during this
      60-day window, can elect in the regular open seasons mentioned in paragraph 50.5. above.
      50.6.2. Active to Reserve: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer to
      DJMS-RC. Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing finance
      office to continue TSP contribution/loan payments without interruption.
      50.6.3. Reserve to Active: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer to
      DJMS-AC. Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing finance
      office to continue TSP contributions/loan payments without interruption.
      50.6.4. One Branch of Service to another Branch of Service: A member may make a new election
      within 60 days of the transfer. Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining
      servicing finance office to continue TSP contributions/loan payments without interruption.
      50.6.5. Military to Federal Civilian: Allows for immediate participation in the TSP
      50.6.6. Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA): Public Law
      103-353, Section 8432B allows any Federal Employee who also serves in the military to make-up
      TSP contributions that were not made to the civilian TSP account while performing that service.
      50.6.7. Contributions may be restarted by either completion of a new TSP-U-1 or by the member pre-
      senting his/her LES showing contributions being withheld and using the former percentage rate. If the
      member wishes to make any changes from the previous withholding, a new TSP-U-1 must be accom-
      plished. If the member wishes to continue contributions at the former withholding rate, have the mem-
      ber write “I wish to continue my TSP withholding(s) at the rates as stated on this LES” on a current
      LES. Have the member sign and date the LES, make a copy for the member, and include the one the
      member signed with the finance office retained documents.

50.7. Contributions.
   50.7.1. No contributions will be taken prior to January 1, 2002.
   50.7.2. All contributions must be made to the NFC via payroll deduction. The maximum contribution
   of basic pay may not exceed 7 percent for any pay period in calendar year (CY) 2002. This limit will
   be increased to 8 percent in 2003, 9 percent in 2004, 10 percent in 2005 and an unlimited percent in
   2006 and later. This unlimited amount may not exceed the IRS established cap. Members may also
   choose to contribute up to 100 percent of special and incentive pays and bonuses. Members must be
   contributing from basic pay in order to contribute from any other pays/bonuses.
   50.7.3. Changes, by the member, to election percentages for basic, special, and incentive pays may
   only be made during an open season or due to circumstances in paragraph 50.6. If the member has a
   valid basic pay election, a start/change to bonuses may be made at any time.
   50.7.4. Members may stop contributions at any time. If the stop is effective within an open season, the
   member may re-enroll in the TSP during the next open season. However, if the stop is effective out-
   side an open season, the member must wait until the second open season following the termination to
   re-enroll in the TSP. Example, member stops TSP contribution on March 1, 2002. Member must wait
   until the second open season (November 15, 2002 through January 31, 2003) to re-enroll. A member
   who terminates basic pay contributions automatically terminates all special, incentive, and bonus con-
   tributions. However, terminating special, incentive or bonus contributions does NOT stop basic pay
   contributions.
   50.7.5. Service Matching Contributions. Matching is not currently funded. This subparagraph will be
   expanded when matching is available.

50.8. Investment Options. TSP contributions deducted from the member’s pay each pay period (i.e.
monthly) are forwarded by DFAS-DE, to the National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, Louisiana.
The NFC initially invests member contributions into the ‘G’ fund. It is the member’s responsibility to
indicate to the NFC the contribution allocation if the member wants contributions sent to funds other than
the “G” fund. Upon receiving a member’s first contribution, NFC will send a TSP password to the mem-
ber’s TSP home address. NFC will also provide quarterly earnings and loan statement to this address.
There are a total of five (5) fund choices available to members. Information on all five funds can be found
at the TSP website mentioned in paragraph 50.2. above. The Website/Thriftline are the most efficient
ways to accomplish the contribution allocation and generally are effective within 2 business days. A
TSP-U-50 may also be used and sent to the NFC.

50.9. Interfund Transfers. This TSP option is available through the NFC only. DFAS cannot move
monies already contributed by the member from one investment fund to another. This is a member
self-service option and is between the member and the NFC (see References in paragraph 50.2.). Transfer
can be done once a month, and are also done via the website, Thriftline, or TSP-U-50.

50.10. Tax Information.
   50.10.1. The annual amount of TSP member contributions (tax deferred) is limited by the Internal
   Revenue Code (IRC). The current elective deferral limit (see IRC section 402(g)) is $11,000 for 2002,
   and legislation already allows an incremental increase of $1,000/yr to this limit, not to exceed $15,000
   in CY 2006.
626                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


      50.10.2. Contributions from combat zone tax exempt pay (IRC section 415(c)) do not count toward
      the $11,000 tax deferred limit, but tax exempt contributions plus tax deferred contributions cannot
      exceed $40,000 for a calendar year. Example: member contributes a $5,000 SRB to TSP in September
      and that puts his tax deferred total to $10,000 for calendar year 2002. In October 2002, the member is
      in a CZTE area and elects career status bonus (CSB). The member’s $30,000 tax free CSB makes the
      total contributed $40,000 ($30,000 tax exempt plus $10,000 tax deferred). Member cannot contribute
      any more to TSP for 2002. The system is programmed to stop sending TSP contributions to the NFC
      and unless changed by the member, the election will stay as is, and RESTART the next calendar year.

50.11. TSP Loan Program. Members may have a total of two loans at any one given time for the follow-
ing purposes: residential (limited to one) and general purpose (may have up to two). The minimum
amount a member can borrow is $1000 and the maximum is $50,000. Loan amounts are granted and
determined based upon monies the member has earned on contributions in the member’s individual
account. The NFC provides statements on a quarterly basis. Loan repayments are accomplished by payroll
deduction only. DJMS-RC will withhold the deduction amount for repayment of the member’s loan. NFC
will process a taxable distribution for each member who does not meet agreed upon repayment terms.
TSP loan process is strictly between the member and the NFC. Direct the member to the NFC for applica-
tion/processing of a TSP loan.

50.12. Breakage. By law, members are entitled to “breakage” on certain contributions that, as a result of
agency error, were not invested when they should have been (and which the member did not otherwise
have use of). Currently, breakage does not apply until the contribution is more than 30 days late being sent
to NFC. This process compensates members for agency error and must be requested via the service’s
claim process (see paragraph 50.15.). Members are not entitled to breakage on contributions that were not
actually deducted from their pay, but they may be entitled to make-up contributions. These additional
funds are deposited to the members account. NFC will divide the money between the fund codes selected
by the member.

50.13. Make-Up Contributions. Members are entitled to make-up contributions if the TSP form was
not processed timely due to no fault of the member. However, because the member had use of the money,
no breakage will be paid. Example: member has elected to make contributions via the TSP-U-1, the form
is not processed in a timely manner, and no contributions are withheld from the member’s pay. The mem-
ber had use of his money so no breakage is payable.

50.14. Error Corrections. Error notification will be provided on the DTR to the input source as done
currently, and will require research and re-input. NFC rejects will be processed at central site. Negative
retroactive processing of entitlements may result in reclaiming the of TSP contributions from the NFC
sent in error. These may require information/coordination with the member’s servicing finance office.

50.15. Claims Procedures. To be added at a later date.

50.16. Owners Of The Program. AF/DPRC, ANG/DPF, and AF/REP are the owners of this program.
Please refer to USAF Uniformed Services TSP implementing policy message as referenced above. The
member’s finance office is not to provide investment advice.

50.17. Source and Method of Input. There are several methods available to start, stop, change, or can-
cel the member’s contribution. These methods are E/MSS (member responsible) and highly recom-
mended, RCIS, DCS, and CICS (these are at the payroll office). RCIS and DCS input instructions will be

   required associated documents will be forwarded to DFAS-PMJFD/DE, DSN 926-4323, 6760 E. Irv-
   ington PL, Denver, CO 80279-3000 for processing.

50.19. Processing Form TSP-U-1. To process TSP contribution elections:
   50.19.1. Ensure that the election was made properly. A contribution election must be a whole percent-
   age and cannot exceed the member contribution limit.
       50.19.1.1. The TSP-U-1 is the required source document.
       50.19.1.2. Ensure the member fills out sections I-IV and signs the form.
       50.19.1.3. Notify the member if the election cannot be processed.
   50.19.2. Establish the effective date of the election.
       50.19.2.1. If a (new accession) member makes a contribution election during the initial 60-day
       window, the agency must make it effective no later than the first full pay period after the election
       is received, but still not earlier than January 2002.
       50.19.2.2. An open season election to begin or change contributions cannot be made effective
       before the last month of the open season period. If the contribution election is received by the
       finance office before the election period, it must be made effective the beginning of the election
       period. If the contribution election is received by the finance office during the election period, it
       must be made effective no later than the beginning of the first full pay period after its receipt. See
       paragraph 50.21.2. under the definition section.
       50.19.2.3. Inter-Service and Intra-Service transfers (see paragraph 50.6.).
   50.19.3. Finance completes section V of the TSP-U-1:
       50.19.3.1. Block 17: 3801 0001
       50.19.3.2. Block 18: see paragraph 50.21.2.; effective date is determined by date received in the
       finance office
       50.19.3.3. Block 19: Required only if the member has completed section III of the form. Member
       may resume contributing during the next open season if contributions are terminated WITHIN an
       open season; if outside an open season period, the member must wait until the second open season
       following termination of contributions.
628                                                                  AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007

      50.19.4. Notify the member of the effective date of the deduction from pay. Ensure the member
      receives a copy of the TSP-U-1, after the agency completes Section V, “For Employing Office Use
      Only”. The original (FORM WITH ORIGINAL SIGNATURE) is retained in the member’s personnel
      file, so ensure the original is returned to your local MPF for filing. Maintain a copy in the finance
      office for at least six months. Agencies must have the capability to retrieve TSP information, as it may
      be provided to another Service if a member transfers, or to an appropriate agency official if a member
      files a claim for error correction.
      50.19.5. Input the transaction and verify that the information, as input, is correct, using the TSP-U-1.
      Ensure customer service reviews and verifies that the input was done correctly, to prevent breakage
      fees, claims, etc. Any elections processed incorrectly must be re-input as soon as possible to prevent
      erroneous deductions and avoid breakage fees.
      50.19.6. The member fills out a new TSP-U-1, sections I, III and IV, to terminate contributions;
      finance completes section V.

50.20. Separations/Retirement Procedures. Separation and retirement transactions should flow auto-
matically from current transaction processing and contributions will systematically be stopped.

50.21. Definitions.
      50.21.1. “As of” date is used by payroll offices on payment records that report makeup and late con-
      tributions. It is the pay date for which TSP contributions should have been made.
      50.21.2. Effective Date establishes when TSP will be deducted from the members’ pay. Use the fol-
      lowing information to determine the effective date:


         DATES ELECTIONS ARE RECEIVED BY FSO                              EFFECTIVE DATE


                 Oct 9 2001 – Dec 08 2001                                      1 Jan 2002

      50.21.3. Open Seasons: Members who have not made elections to begin contributions during initial
      enrollment and accession periods may elect to begin participating in the TSP during a TSP open sea-
      son. In addition, members who are contributing may elect to change the amount they are contributing
      during a TSP open season. There are two TSP open seasons each year. Currently, the open seasons are
      May 15 through July 31 and November 15 through January 31. Elections made during TSP open sea-
      sons must be made effective no later than the first pay period after they are received; however, no elec-
      tion may be made effective earlier than the last month of the open season (i.e., July or January).

  50.21.5. Attributable pay date is used on negative adjustment records that remove erroneous contribu-
  tions previously reported and on recharacterization records which change the tax characterization of
  contributions previously reported. It is the pay date of the original (erroneous or erroneously charac-
  terized) contribution or, if the original contribution was a makeup or late contribution, the original
  payment was previously sent to NFC.

  but were not timely reported to the TSP and, if applicable, attributable matching contributions; and/or
  resubmitted contributions that may have been reported on time but were not processed by the NFC
  when originally reported because the payment records contained errors.
  50.21.9. Makeup contributions are contributions that should have been deducted from a member’s
  pay (or, in the case of attributable matching contributions, charged to a service’s appropriation) on an
  earlier pay date but are being deducted (or charged) for the current pay date.
  50.21.10. Matching contributions are contributions made by the uniformed service to the TSP
  accounts of its members who are entitled to such contributions. See TSP Bulletin 01-U-3 for more
  information about matching contributions. These contributions are not currently funded.
  50.21.11. Ordinary tax-deferred contributions are member contributions that are made from compen-
  sation that is subject to taxation, and not subject to the Federal income tax exclusion at 26 U.S.C. §112
  (applicable to compensation for service in a month in which a member serves in a combat zone).

tions) and include applicable TSP counseling in financial management, separation/retirement, and casu-
alty assistance programs.
640                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


5.3.3. Allow members to elect to participate in the TSP and enroll in the TSP by completing the election
form, TSP Form U-1.


5.3.4. Develop procedures in collaboration with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to process
the data from the form.


5.3.5. Develop procedures in collaboration with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to transmit
the required data to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service.


5.4.   The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) must create the Employee Data Record,
TSP Form U-6, using data received from the Military Services, and must calculate the TSP deduction.
DFAS must transmit the TSP Form U-6 to the National Finance Center (NFC--who serves as the TSP
record keeper). DFAS must transmit the member's contribution to the NFC. DFAS must transmit other
records/payments to the NFC in accordance with FRTIB announcements and bulletins (reference (d)).


6. Procedures.


6.1.   Eligibility to Participate in the TSP. Any member of the military services serving on active duty
and any member of the Ready Reserve in any pay status may participate in the Thrift Savings Plan in
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8440e (reference (a)).


Reservists who are Federal civilian employees will have two TSP accounts if participating as a Reservist
and civilian


6.2.   Amount of Contribution.


6.2.1. Members on Active Duty/Members of the Ready Reserve. Subject to applicable dollar limitations
of sections 402(g) and 415(c) of reference (e), the maximum percentage that a member on active duty and
members of the Ready Reserve may contribute out of inactive duty training compensation in any pay
period shall be determined in accordance with enclosure 2.


6.2.2. Members Receiving Special or Incentive Pay. Subject to applicable dollar limitations of sections
402(g) and 415(c) of reference (e), a member who is contributing to the Thrift Savings Plan out of basic
pay, or out of inactive duty training compensation, may also contribute (by direct transfer to the Fund) any
part of any special or incentive pay (including bonuses) that such member receives. Except for bonuses,
members must make all contribution elections during an open season. Members may elect, during an open
season, to contribute special or incentive pay in anticipation of becoming entitled to it in the future.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                641


Should a member make such an election, the election will take effect whenever the member becomes enti-
tled to the special or incentive pay.


6.3.   When Members May Participate in the TSP.


6.3.1. Any individual who is a member as October 9, 2001 may elect to participate in the TSP during the
60-day period beginning on such effective date. An election made under this subparagraph shall take
effect on the first day of the first applicable pay period in January 2002.


6.3.1.2.      Members who join the military services on or after October 9, 2001 (and those who rejoin
following a break in service on or after October 9, 2001) will be able to elect to participate in the TSP
within 60 days of joining the military services. For the purpose of making TSP contribution elections, a
member shall be deemed to have joined the military services on the date the member first becomes eligi-
ble (or becomes reeligible for those members who rejoin following a break in service) to receive basic pay
or inactive duty training compensation.1 The day following this date should be considered day one of this
60-day window. If a member decides to participate in the TSP during this 60-day window, the member’s
service must make the election effective no later than the first full pay period after the election is received.
New members who do not enroll during this 60-day period (and those who rejoin following a break in ser-
vice) will have two "open seasons" per year to enroll thereafter. The Department of Defense, in consulta-
tion with the Executive Director, FRTIB, shall determine when it is not administratively feasible to afford
certain members an opportunity to participate in the TSP on the date the member becomes eligible to
receive basic pay. A sample notification letter for new members is at Enclosure 4.


6.3.1.3.        Members who have made a valid election to contribute a portion of their basic pay or inac-
tive duty training compensation may make an election to contribute bonus pay at any time.


6.3.1.4.       Members of the Ready Reserve who perform periods of continuous active duty greater
than 30 days may make TSP elections outside of an open season provided such elections are made within
60 days of the beginning of the active duty.


6.3.1.5.       Members on active duty who are subsequently assigned to the Ready Reserve in a pay sta-
tus may make TSP elections outside of an open season provided such elections are made within 60 days
of the conversion.


6.3.2. Except as provided in subparagraph 6.3.1, an election to contribute to the Thrift Savings Fund
under this section may be made only during a period provided under section 8432(b) of reference (a), sub-
ject to the same conditions as prescribed under paragraphs (2)(A)-(D) thereof.

1. Army uses the term "pay entry basic date" (PEBD), Navy and Marine Corps use the term "pay entry
base date" (PEBD), and Air Force uses the term "pay date."
642                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



6.3.2.1.       Members who terminate basic pay or inactive duty training compensation elective defer-
rals must terminate all other elective deferrals. If the termination is made outside of an open season, the
member must wait until the second open season following the termination to reenroll in the TSP. If the ter-
mination is made during an open season, the member may reenroll in the TSP during the next open sea-
son.


6.3.2.2.        Members who terminate special, incentive, or bonus pay elective deferrals need not termi-
nate basic pay or inactive duty training compensation elective deferrals. If the termination is made outside
of an open season, the member must wait until the second open season following the termination to rein-
state elective deferrals from special or incentive pay. If the termination is made during an open season, the
member may reinstate elective deferrals from special or incentive pay during the next open season.


6.4.   Separation from Service. For purposes of subchapters III and VII of chapter 84 of reference (a),
each of the following actions shall, in the case of a member participating in the TSP Plan in accordance
with section 8440e of reference (a), be considered a separation from Government employment:


6.4.1. Discharge of the member from active duty or the ready Reserve, not followed, before the end of
the 31-day period beginning on the day following the effective date of the release, by:


6.4.1.1.       A resumption of active duty;


6.4.1.2.       An appointment to a position covered by chapter 83 or 84 of reference (a) or an equivalent
retirement system, as identified by the Executive Director (appointed by the FRTIB) in regulations; or


6.4.1.3.       Continued service in or affiliation with the Ready Reserve.2


6.4.2. Transfer of the member to inactive status, or to a retired list pursuant to any provision of title 10,
United States Code (reference (f)).


7. Applicable Internal Revenue Code Limitations.




2. Reserve component members serving on full-time active duty who terminate their active duty service
and subsequently participate in the drilling Reserve are said to "continue" in the Ready Reserve. Active
component members who are released from active duty and subsequently participate in the drilling
Reserve are said to "affiliate" with the Ready Reserve.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                643


7.1.    Regular Contributions. Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (reference (e)), limits the
amount of income an employee may elect to defer (annual elective deferral amount) under all cash or
deferred arrangements (e.g., the TSP or a 401(k) plan) during a tax year. In 2002, the year in which when
members of the military services begin to contribute to the TSP, the maximum amount of income a mem-
ber may elect to defer under all cash or deferred arrangements will be $11,000.3 DFAS must ensure that
each member's regular contributions do not exceed the applicable limitation of section 402(g) of reference
(e).


7.1.1. A Reservist who is a Federal civilian employee will have two TSP accounts if participating as a
Reservist and civilian.


7.1.2. For Reservists who have a civilian TSP account (or another qualified employer plan described
under sections 401(k), 403(b), 408(k), or 457 of reference (e), the total of all contributions to all plans
cannot exceed reference (e) elective deferral limit. Reservists with private-sector plans should consult
with their plan administrator concerning any limitation on the amount they can contribute to their TSP
account.


7.2.   Matching Contributions. When a member is receiving matching contributions (as described in
paragraph 8, below), the member's total elective deferrals and matching contributions may not exceed the
amount specified section 415(c) of reference (e). At present, this amount is the lesser of $40,000 or 100
percent of the member's compensation. DFAS will ensure that each member's regular contributions do not
exceed the applicable limitation of section 415(c) of reference (e).


7.2.1. A Reservist who is a Federal civilian employee will have two TSP accounts if participating as a
Reservist and civilian
7.2.2. The section 415(c) limit of reference (e) applies to the total of both accounts and not to each
account separately.


7.3.   Compensation Excluded from Income under Internal Revenue Code section 112.


7.3.1. When a member contributes compensation to the TSP that has been excluded from income under
section 112 (the combat zone tax exclusion), it is not subject to the annual elective deferral limitation of
section 402(g) of reference (e). It is subject to the limitation of section 415(c) of reference (e). Thus, in a

3. In 2003, it will be $12,000; in 2004, it will be $13,000; in 2005, it will be $14,000; and in 2006, it will
be $15,000. It will thereafter be indexed for inflation. This limit does not apply to tax-exempt
contributions (that is, contributions from income that has been exempted from taxation due to combat
zone service. However, section 415(c) of the I. R. C., which limits the amount of total employee and
employer contributions to the participant’s TSP account each year to the lesser of $40,000 or 100% of
compensation, applies to both tax-deferred and tax-exempt contributions. See paragraph 8, below.
644                                                                AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


year in which a member has $60,000 in compensation, the member could contribute $40,000 to the TSP
(that is, the lesser of $40,000 or 100 percent of compensation). See Enclosure 5.


Compensation refers to amounts reported in block one of IRS Form W-2. Amounts excluded from block
one solely due to the combat zone tax exclusion count as block one IRS Form W-2 compensation. Non-
taxable allowances (BAH, BAS, et cetera) do not count as block one wages.


7.3.2. Even when received in a combat zone, monthly contributions from basic pay or inactive duty
training compensation still may not exceed the percent allowed by the law for such compensation. See
paragraph 6.2.1, above. However, a member who is receiving special or incentive pay may contribute any
or all of such pay to the TSP (subject to the limitation described in this paragraph). See paragraph 6.2.2
above.


7.3.3. Because the member receives no tax benefit from contributing compensation that has been
excluded from gross income to the TSP, contributions from this compensation creates a basis in the mem-
ber's TSP account. These amounts are not subject to taxation when withdrawn from the TSP.


7.3.3.1.     DFAS must implement procedures to notify the FRTIB of each member's contributions
from compensation that has been excluded from gross income due to service in a combat zone or other eli-
gible area.


7.3.3.3.        In a month that an officer serves in a combat zone or other eligible area and has total tax-
able compensation that exceeds the highest rate of basic pay paid to each Service's senior enlisted member
(and any hazardous duty/imminent danger pay received by the officer), contributions shall first be taken
from tax excluded pay. Contributions will be taken from taxable compensation only when the officer is
both eligible to contribute more than the amount excluded from compensation and has made an effective
election to make contributions that exceed the amount excluded from compensation.


7.4.   Loans.


7.4.1. A Reservist who is a Federal civilian employee will have two TSP accounts if participating as a
Reservist and civilian.


7.4.2. The Internal Revenue Code (reference (e)) maximum loan amount applies to the total of both
accounts and not to each account separately.
7.4.3. FRTIB publications (reference (c)) provide guidance on minimum and maximum loan amounts.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            645


8. Special Retention Initiative.


8.1.    The Secretaries of the Military Services may enter into an agreement with a member to make con-
tributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for the benefit of the member if the member:


8.1.1. Is in a specialty designated by the Secretary as critical to meet requirements (whether such spe-
cialty is designated as critical to meet wartime or peacetime requirements); and


8.1.2. Commits in such agreement to continue to serve on active duty in that specialty for a period of 6
years.


8.2.    A member serving in a specialty so designated will receive matching contributions to the mem-
ber's thrift savings account in accordance with section 8432(c) of reference (a) (except that the agency
automatic contribution under 8432(c)(1) shall not apply). See enclosure 3.


8.3.     If, after a member enters into such an agreement, the Secretary concerned determines that the spe-
cialty is no longer critical, the member shall, nevertheless, continue to receive matching contributions.


9. Loans.


9.1. Loan disbursements for uniformed services (UNISERV) accounts will be made on a pro-rata basis
from both taxable and non-taxable contributions.


9.2.   Loans will be assigned unique numbers that indicate the plan (UNISERV or civilian) from which
they were made.


9.2.1. When a member has both a civilian TSP account and a UNISERV TSP account, the maximum
loan amount applies to the combined accounts and not to each account separately.


9.2.2. Loan repayments will be applied to the employee contributions portion of the account on the same
taxable/non-taxable basis as when the funds were removed.


9.3.   All loan payments will be sent by DFAS using records designed by the FRTIB and the National
Finance Center (NFC--which serves as the FRTIB's record keeper), in consultation with the DoD.
DoD-submitted payments will be credited to the specific loan number as provided by the payroll office.
646                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


10. Payment of Lost Earnings.


10.1. By law, participants are entitled to lost earnings on certain contributions that, as a result of error,
were not invested when they should have been (and which the employee did not otherwise receive).
10.2. An error means any act or omission by a Service or by DFAS that is not in accordance with all
applicable statutes, regulations, or administrative procedures, including TSP procedures provided to Ser-
vices by the Board or TSP record keeper. See enclosure 6.


10.3. Any amount a Military Department must pay for lost earnings under this section shall be paid from
the current applicable Military Personnel appropriation.


10.4. Members are not entitled to lost earnings on their contributions that were not actually deducted
from their pay and were paid to them.4 Members are entitled to make-up such contributions from current
pay.


10.5. Thus, TSP regulations require Services to pay lost earnings on agency makeup contributions, on
employee makeup contributions attributable to a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustments, and
on late contributions, but they prohibit the payment of lost earnings on other employee makeup contribu-
tions.5


11. SERVICE PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE LOST EARNINGS. Each Military Service must
provide procedures for participants to file claims for lost earnings under this part. The procedures must
include the requirements specified part 1606 of reference (f).


12. EMPLOYEE THRIFT ADVISORY COUNCIL. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Man-
agement Policy) shall designate the Uniformed Services' representative to the Employee Thrift Advisory
Council of the FRTIB.



4. The reasoning is that, because the agency failed to deduct TSP contributions from an employee’s pay,
albeit erroneously, the member had use of the money — whether for spending or saving. The agency
therefore should not be required to pay the employee earnings on such amounts, since this would be
tantamount to double compensation.
5. Generally, lost earnings are determined using the rates of return for the funds in which the participant
had elected to invest at the time the error was made (i.e., according to the participant’s contribution
allocation for the “as of” date). However, lost earnings on agency makeup contributions attributable to
the application of the provisions of Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and
lost earnings on makeup contributions resulting from a back pay award for an erroneous separation are
determined using the rates of return for the G Fund.

serve on active duty for six years. Matching contributions apply only to basic pay. These contributions are
matched dollar for dollar on the first three percent of pay the member contributes each pay period and 50
cents on the dollar on the next two percent of pay. Matching is inapplicable to amounts contributed in
excess of 5%.

          SAMPLE LETTER FOR NEW MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY SERVICES
                  (AND THOSE WHO REJOIN AFTER A BREAK IN SERVICE)




Now that you are a member of the [insert Service name] you are eligible to participate in the Thrift Sav-
ings Plan (TSP). The TSP is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal civilian members and
for members of the uniformed services.


Your TSP contributions are deducted from the pay you earn each pay period and are tax-deferred for pur-
poses of Federal and, in most cases, state income tax. Earnings attributable to you contributions grow tax
free until you withdraw them.


Beginning Your Contributions. You have 60 days from the date you first become eligible to receive basic
pay or inactive duty training compensation to make an election to begin contributing to your TSP account.
To make a contribution election, complete the [attached] Form TSP-U-1 (Election Form) and return it to
[insert office name] by [insert date]. {If members may, or must, make electronic contribution elections,
revise this sentence accordingly.}


If you do not make a contribution election within this 60-day time period, you must wait until a TSP open
season to make a contribution election. There are two TSP open seasons each year: May 15 through July
31 and November 15 through January 31.


You must specify a whole percentage of basic pay or inactive duty training compensation up to [*]% that
you want to contribute each pay period. Provided you elect to contribute from basic pay or inactive duty
training compensation, you may also elect to contribute from special pay, incentive pay, and bonuses. Any
election to contribute from special pay, incentive pay, and bonuses must also be specified as a whole per-
centage. Unlike basic pay or inactive duty training compensation, the percentage you may contribute from
these types of pay is not limited. You may elect to contribute from one to one hundred percent of any spe-
cial pay, incentive pay, or bonus that you receive. If you believe you might become entitled to special pay,
incentive pay, or bonuses, you may elect to contribute from them now. Your election will take effect
whenever you become entitled to this pay.


Your TSP elections will stay in effect until you submit another election during a subsequent TSP open
season, you stop your contributions, or you separate from service. For example, if you elect to contribute
from a bonus, your election will cover future installments or any other bonus you become entitled to. If
this is not what you intend, you will need to terminate your bonus election once you contribute from your
current bonus.
652                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


Changing Your Contributions. To change the percentage you are contributing to the TSP, you must make
another contribution election during a TSP open season. You may make a contribution election to stop
your contributions at any time by submitting Form TSP-U-1 to [insert office name]. However, because
you must contribute from basic pay or inactive duty training compensation in order to contribute from
special pay, incentive pay, or bonuses, if you terminate basic pay or inactive duty training compensation
contributions, your contributions from special pay, incentive pay, or bonuses will automatically terminate.
You may, however, terminate contributions from special pay, incentive pay, or bonuses yet continue con-
tributions from basic pay or inactive duty training compensation. If you terminate a special or incentive
pay election outside of an open season, normal reinstatement rules for contributions from these elements
of pay will apply (that is, if you make an election to stop your contributions outside an open season, you
must wait until the second open season after you terminate before you may resume your contributions).


Allocating contributions. You may invest your contributions in any of the five TSP investment funds. To
direct the investment of the contributions which will be made to your account each pay period, you must
request a contribution allocation by using the TSP Web site (www.tsp.gov), the ThriftLine
(504-255-8777), or Form TSP-U-50 (Investment Allocation). If you use the Web site or the ThriftLine,
you will need your TSP Personal Identification Number (PIN).


The TSP record keeper, the National Finance Center (NFC), will notify you when your account is estab-
lished. This notification will include your TSP PIN. Any time after you receive this notification, you may
request a contribution allocation. Until you request a contribution allocation, your contributions will be
invested in the Government Securities Investment (G) Fund.


Changing the investment of your account balance. You may also use the Web, the ThriftLine, or Form
TSP-U-50 to request an interfund transfer. An interfund transfer will change the investment of your
account balance (i.e., money already in your account). Please note that an interfund transfer is different
from a contribution allocation, which changes only the investment of future contributions to your account.
If you want to change the investment of both your account balance and future contributions to your
account, you must request both an interfund transfer and a contribution allocation. You may request an
interfund transfer at any time. However, interfund transfers are only processed once a month and affect
your account balance as of the end of the relevant month.


Additional information. The attached booklet Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan for Members of the
Uniformed Services contains detailed information about the TSP. It discusses participation and contribu-
tion rules, investment options, loans, withdrawals, and other important TSP information (e.g., designating
TSP beneficiaries). Please read this booklet before you make a TSP contribution election and retain it for
future reference.


For additional information about the TSP investment funds and the processing of investment requests
(contribution allocations and interfund transfers), see the Guide to TSP Investments, which is available at
the {insert office name] or from the TSP Web site, www.tsp.gov.

All TSP products and forms are available from the TSP Web site. This site also contains other information
about the TSP and, when you enter your TSP PIN, allows you to obtain information about your account.
You may want to visit the site before you make a contribution election.

and other information, as appropriate.]


[Attachment: Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan for Members of the Uniformed Services]
* {Beginning in January 2002, members of the uniformed services may contribute up to 7% of the basic
pay they earn each pay period to the TSP. This will increase by 1% each year for the subsequent four
years, and in 2006, the limit will be lifted and members will be subject only to the limits of the Internal
Revenue Code. Thus, for letters issued in 2002, this figure should be 7%; for 2003, this figure should be
8%, and so forth. See TSP Bulletin 01-3, dated January 23, 2001, for more information about the new con-
tribution limits.}
654                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


                TSP CONTRIBUTIONS BY OFFICERS FROM TAX EXEMPT PAY


In a month that an officer serves in a combat zone or other eligible area and has total taxable compensa-
tion that exceeds the highest rate of basic pay paid to each Service's senior enlisted member (and any haz-
ardous duty/imminent danger pay received by the officer), contributions shall first be taken from tax
excluded pay. Contributions will be taken from taxable compensation only when the officer is both eligi-
ble to contribute more than the amount excluded from compensation and has made an effective election to
make contributions that exceed the amount excluded from compensation.


Example. Suppose the highest rate of basic pay paid to each Service's senior enlisted member is $4500
and that hazardous duty/imminent danger pay is $150 per month. An officer who earns $5,000 per month
in basic pay and receives a $10,000 bonus in a month in which the officer serves in combat zone (which
has also been designated an imminent danger pay area) could exclude no more than $4,650 from gross
income (that is, $4,500 plus $150).


If the officer had a 7 percent basic pay election in effect, but had not elected to contribute from the bonus,
the full $350 contribution from basic pay (i.e., 7% x $5,000 = $350) would be reported as a non-taxable,
combat zone contribution.


If the officer had a 7 percent basic pay contribution election in effect and a 100% bonus pay contribution
election in effect, $4,650 would be reported as a non-taxable, combat zone contribution and $5,700 would
be reported as a regular contribution. These amounts are calculated as follows:


               Total Contribution = $10,3506


               (i.e., (7% x $5,000=$350) + (100% x $10,000 =$10,000) = $10,350)


               Maximum nontaxable contribution is $4,650.


               $10,350 - $4,650 = $5,700 (which represents the member’s regular contribution).




6. Note. Contributions from combat zone tax exempt pay do not count against the elective deferral limit
of section 402(g) of reference (e)--see footnote 3.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                              655


                                    LOST EARNINGS EXAMPLES


Example 1. On December 18, 2002, SGT Smith submitted TSP-U-1 to her personnel office. She made a 7
percent basic pay election and contributions should have been deducted from her January pay (effective
31 January). Specialist Jones misplaced the form and did not transmit it to his payroll office until February
27. The first TSP deductions were taken from SGT Smith’s March pay (effective 31 March). SGT Smith
received her full pay in January and February.


SGT Smith is not entitled to lost earnings. Payment of lost earnings is prohibited by Section 8432a(a)(2)
of Title 5, United States Code, when the administrative error involves the failure to deduct contributions
from the member’s pay-check and the member had use of the money. Services may not pay lost earnings
on “make-up” member contributions (i.e., contributions that were not withheld from a member’s pay-
check when required due to an administrative error but were deducted in subsequent pay periods in accor-
dance with the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s error correction regulations (5 CFR 1605)).


If SGT Smith was in a critical specialty and was eligible to receive matching contributions, her service
would be required to pay lost earnings on the matching contributions associated with those “ make-up”
member contributions (even though lost earnings cannot be paid on the member contributions that were
not deducted when required).


Example 2. Petty Officer Williams, who was participating in the TSP, performed weekend drill during the
second weekend in January. He submitted all paperwork necessary to be paid and should have been paid
(in accordance with his Service’s standard procedure) on January 31st. Processing his paperwork was
delayed and he was neither paid nor had TSP contributions made until March 15th.


Petty Officer Williams is entitled to lost earnings since he never had use of the money and since his TSP
contribution was more than 30 days late. His service’s payroll office must submit a lost earnings calcula-
tion request to the NFC.


Example 3. Lance Corporal Gray was participating in the TSP and had elected to contribute 50% of any
bonus he received to the TSP. On June 3d he was paid $5,000 of his $10,000 renenlistment bonus. His ser-
vice’s payroll office contributed the remaining $5,000 to his TSP account when it disbursed his end of
month check.


Lance Corporal Gray is not entitled to lost earnings because the contribution to the TSP was less than 30
days late.


Note: When the TSP implements its new record keeping systems, payments that are more than 2 days late
will generate lost earnings (which will be called breakage under the new system).
656                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



Example 4. Service X’s entire payroll record was rejected by the NFC due to reporting errors caused by
improper coding in its payroll office. The TSP deductions were taken from the member’s accounts on
August 31st. Service X’s transmission to the NFC was not accepted until October 7th.
Service X must pay lost earnings for the period August 31 through October 7.


Example 5. Specialist Smith became eligible for a special pay on July 28th. DFAS's cut-off for processing
July transactions was July 27th. Because of this cut-off, Specialist Smith did not receive the special pay
until her received his paycheck for August, which was directly deposited into his bank account on Sep-
tember 1st.


Specialist Smith is not owed lost earnings because his pay was, using normal administrative procedures,
timely. That is, the payment in September did not constitute an error.

1. Add the following new Section to read:


“5102 THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN (TSP)


510201. General. The Thrift Savings Plan is a retirement savings and investment plan for federal employ-
ees. Congress established the plan as part of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L.
99-335) and 5 U.S.C. 8431-8440d. Participation in the plan for military members was allowed by the
National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2000 (P.L. 106-65, October 5, 1999) and amended by the
National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2001 (P.L. 106-398, October 30, 2000). The plan offers tax
deferral advantages similar to those on an individual retirement account (IRA). The Federal Retirement
Thrift Investment Board, which operates the plan solely for the benefit of the participants and their bene-
ficiaries, administers the plan. The record keeper for the plan is the National Finance Center (NFC) in
New Orleans, Louisiana. The NFC issues TSP Bulletins providing necessary guidance relating to TSP
operations. All Bulletins are to be retained pending NFC’s disposition instructions. The military TSP plan
shall be referred to as the “UNISERVE PLAN (Uniformed Services).”


510202. Definitions.


A. “Member” means:


1. a member of the uniformed services serving on active duty; and


2. a member of the Ready Reserve in any pay status.


B. “Basic pay” means the person’s entitlement to the pay grade to which assigned or distributed in accor-
dance with their years of service computed. A member of a reserve component who is not entitled to basic
pay is entitled to compensation, at the rate of 1/30 of the basic pay authorized.


C. “Military Services” refers to the Uniformed Services as defined (See Definitions, Item 109).


510203. Participation Rules.


A. When to Begin TSP Deductions. Any eligible member may elect to participate in this plan starting
October 9, 2001. A member may make the first election during the initial 60-day period beginning Octo-
ber 9 through December 8, 2001. Deductions for elections made during this initial period will begin the
first day of the first applicable pay period in January 2002.
660                                                                 AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


1. Members who do not enroll during this initial 60-day period; will have two “open seasons” per year to
enroll thereafter. The first “open season” following the initial 60-day period is scheduled for December 9,
2001, through January 31, 2002. Members can elect to start or change their elections during open seasons
held each year (November-January and May-July). An election form can be submitted at any time during
an open season, but contributions will not begin before the last full month of open season (the last month
of each open season is called the election period.)


2. Members who join the uniformed service on or after October 9, 2001, as well as those who rejoin fol-
lowing a break in service on or after October 9, 2001, will be able to elect to participate in the TSP within
60 days of joining the uniformed service. A member shall be deemed to have joined the uniformed service
on the date the member first becomes eligible (or becomes reeligible for those members who rejoin fol-
lowing a break in service) to receive basic pay. The day following the member’s pay entry basic date
should be considered day one of this 60-day window. If a member decides to participate in the TSP during
this 60-day window, the member’s service must make the election effective no later than the first full pay
period after the election is received.


3. Member Transfers. When a member transfers between components or branches of the Uniformed Ser-
vices, their TSP contribution may be continued. The member needs to notify their gaining servicing orga-
nization of their current TSP rates in order to continue TSP contributions/loan payments without
interruption; or


a. For Active to Reserve transfers: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer.
Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing office to continue TSP
contributions/loan payments without interruption; or


b. For Reserve to Active transfers: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer.
Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing organization to continue
TSP contributions/loan payments without interruption; or


c. Transferring from one branch of Service to another branch of Service: A member may make a new
election within 60 days of the transfer.


B. The maximum amount a member may contribute may not exceed 7% of basic pay or compensation for
any pay period. No contribution for any given year may exceed limitation under section 415 of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                             661


1. The maximum amount a member may contribute out of basic pay in any pay period shall be increased
in accordance with the following table:


          Pay period in          Maximum allowable
               2002                     7 percent
               2003                     8 percent
               2004                     9 percent
               2005                    10 percent
               2006 and after         100 percent


C. A member making contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund out of basic pay or compensation may also
contribute any part of any special pay, incentive pay, or bonus that the member receives under chapter 5
of title 37 U.S.C. (See Table 51.2, Thrift Savings Plan Election.)


D. All contributions must be made through payroll deduction. Lump-sum contributions for special,
incentive, and bonus payments are permitted. Total contributions (to include base pay) are not to exceed
limitations under sections 402(g) and 415c) of the Internal Revenue Code.


E. A member may contribute a whole percentage of pay, incentive, and special pays, and any allowable
bonuses. See subparagraph C above.


F. The choice to stop contributing to TSP is permitted at any time. It is effective at the end of the pay
period in which that election is accepted by the member’s servicing activity.


510204. Matching Contributions. The Service Secretary may enter into an agreement with a member to
make matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for the benefit of the member if the member is in
a specialty designated as critical to meet wartime or peacetime requirements. The member shall commit
to serve on active duty in that specialty for a period of 6 years.


A. The Service Secretary will make these contributions for each pay period of the 6-year period that the
member makes contributions.


B. Contributions are matched dollar for dollar for the first three percent of base pay contributed per pay
period, and then 50 cents on the dollar for the next two percent of pay contributed per pay period, not to
exceed 5 percent of base pay.
662                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


510205. TSP Loan Program.


A. General. Under 5 U.S.C. 8433(i), all TSP participants are eligible to obtain a TSP loan. Members may
borrow only from their own contributions and earnings. The minimum amount a member can borrow is
$1,000. A member may have a total of two loans. The total outstanding loans cannot exceed $50,000.
When a member has both a civilian TSP account and a UNISERV TSP account, the maximum loan
amount applies to the combined accounts and not to each account separately.


B. Types of Loans. Loans can be made for the following purposes:


1. Residential; and


2. General purpose.


C. Interest Rate. The interest rate shall be the posted rate for the G Fund at the time the terms of the loan
are established. The rate is fixed at that level for the life of the loan, and the interest paid on the loan shall
go back to the employee’s own TSP account and is not tax deductible.


D. Tax Exempt Amounts. When a participating member has contributions that are made from tax exempt
pay as well as from tax deferred pay, the loan principle will be made and repaid on a pro rata basis from
these funds.


For additional information, see TSP Bulletin 96-33 and Volume 7C, Chapter 10, TSP, of this regulation.


510206. Breakage (Lost TSP Earnings) due to Agency Error.


A. Authority. Title 5 C.F.R. Part 1606 implemented Section 2 of P.L. 101-355, which provides statutory
authority for employing agencies to pay to the TSP amounts representing breakage (lost earnings) result-
ing from agency errors. If a member receives pay from which member contributions should have been
deducted, but as a result of agency error, all or any part of those deductions were not made, then even if
the member makes up those member contributions, the belated member contributions shall not be subject
to lost earnings. The following are conditions that require payment of breakage:


1. Delayed or Erroneous Contributions When Member Received Pay
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            663


a. If a member receives pay, but as a result of an agency error all or any part of the Agency Contribution
associated with that pay are not timely received by the TSP Recordkeeper, the belated contributions shall
be subject to breakage.


b. If a member receives pay from which his or her contributions were properly deducted but, as a result
of an agency error, all or any part of the associated agency matching contributions were not timely
received by the TSP Recordkeeper, then the belated contributions will be subject to breakage.


c. If a member receives pay from which his or her contributions were properly deducted but, as a result of
an agency error all or any part of those member contributions were not timely received by the TSP
Recordkeeper, the belated contributions will be subject to breakage.


2. Agency Delay in Basic Pay. Where, as the result of an agency error, a member does not timely receive
all or any part of basic pay to which entitled, all such belated member contributions and agency matching
contributions shall be subject to breakage.


3. Late Payroll Submissions. All contributions contained in a payroll submission received by the TSP
Recordkeeper more than 2 days after the pay date associated with that payroll submission shall be subject
to breakage.


4. Loan Allotments. Loan allotments deducted from a member’s pay but not timely received by the TSP
Recordkeeper due to agency error shall be subject to breakage.


B. Minimum Dollar Amount. Breakage on loan allotments and late contributions shall be calculated by
the TSP system only for those contributions and loan allotments that are $1 or more.


C. Agency Responsibility. The employing agency whose error caused a late or erroneous investment of
money in the TSP is responsible for payment of any breakage resulting from that error. The paying office
that submitted payment records or loan allotments that are subject to breakage is also responsible for sub-
mitting the appropriate breakage records relating to those submissions. The amount of breakage that is
calculated shall be charged to the TSP clearing account of the submitting paying office. Where another
employing agency caused the late or erroneous submission by the submitting paying office, the paying
office that was charged for the amount of breakage calculated should seek reimbursement from the other
employing agency.


D. For detailed information concerning the breakage (lost earnings) process, refer to TSP Bulletins
90-39, 90-40, 90-41, 90-42, 91-3, 991-4, 91-34, 92-29, 95-13, and 98-21. The TSP Bulletins are available

The attached draft proposed change adds a new chapter to DoDFMR, Vol 7C, Chapter 10 as
"Thrift Savings Plan.




1. Add a new Chapter 10 to read as follows:


                          CHAPTER 10 – THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN (TSP)


1001 GENERAL PROVISIONS


100101 AUTHORITY:             P.L. 106-65, October 5, 1999 as amended by
                              P.L. 106-398, Section 661, October 30, 2000
                              5 U. S. C. 8440e
                              37 U.S.C. 211


100102 PURPOSE: This chapter provides the policy/procedures for the administration of the Thrift Sav-
ings Plan for military members serving on active duty and Ready Reserve in any pay status. See DoD-
FMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 510201, for eligibility requirements.


100103 PROCEDURES:


A. The Military Service Responsibilities:


1. Educate members on TSP program benefits. Members will be counseled on TSP benefits upon
accession, as well as on-going training throughout the year. All marketing and distribution of forms will
be performed by personnel.


2. Maintain completed forms. For members who enroll or change a current enrollment, the hard copy of
the TSP-U-1 is maintained by the respective personnel office. The information from the TSP-U-1 may be
electronically processed to the paying system. The copy of these documents must be maintained for a total
of 56 years from separation in accordance with DFAS 5015.2-M, Records Disposition Schedule, January
2000.
670                                                              AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



3. Forward copy of TSP-U-1 to financial servicing office of member. A copy of the TSP-U-1 is for-
warded to the members financial serving office (FSO). For those FSOs using the personnel-pay interface,
the data to establish the TSP contributions on the member’s Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) will
flow electronically to the FSO. For those FSOs without the personnel-pay interface, manually enter the
member’s TSP-U-1 data into the MMPA. All offices must work closely with the respective personnel
office to ensure accurate data is established for the member in accordance with the information provided
on the TSP-U-1 Form.


4. Member Transfers. Transfers may be


a. Active to Reserve: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer. Otherwise, the
TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing office to continue TSP contribution/loan
payments without interruption.


b. Reserve to Active: A member may make a new election within 60 days of the transfer. Otherwise, the
TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing organization to continue TSP contribu-
tions/loan payments without interruption.


c. One Branch of Service to another branch of Service: A member may make a new election within 60
days of the transfer. Otherwise, the TSP election can be presented to the member’s gaining servicing orga-
nization to continue TSP contributions/loan payments without interruption.


SEE TSP BULLETIN 01-4 for participation rules.


A. DFAS Responsibilities:


1. The information from the TSP-U-1 may have to be entered on the member’s Military Pay Account by
the FSO, if it is not provided electronically.


a. All collections taken on behalf of military members are distributed to the G Investment Fund. Members
can then contact the National Finance Center (NFC) to allocate contributions among five investment plan
funds.


(1) G Fund which consists of investment in U.S. Government securities.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                671


(2) F Fund which is invested in guaranteed private-sector investment contracts, certificates of deposit and
other securities that offer a specified interest rate.


(3) C Fund which is invested in an index of Common stocks.


(4) I Fund is the international fund tracking
                       Morgan Stanley EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) Index.


(5) S Fund is the small capitalization fund tracking the Wilshire 4500 index.


2. Accounting Procedures.


a. A no-check-issue procedure is used to transfer to the National Finance Center (NFC) the amount col-
lected from member TSP deductions, as well as any agency contributions. Under this procedure, the
respective DFAS center disbursing office does not use a check as the means of payment to the NFC.
Funds are transferred to the NFC using the DoD accounting procedure and the TSP Certification of Trans-
fer of Funds and Journal Voucher (Form TSP-U-2).


(1) Credit the amounts due NFC to a suspense clearing account with the U.S. Department of Treasury.


(2) Prepare TSP-U-2 in accordance with the TSP voucher/summary type output product that is produced
from the automated system or use a certified automated listing. After certification, the journal voucher (or
certified listing) is forwarded to NFC together with the TSP file produced for that pay period. NFC
requests receipt of the journal voucher (or certified listing) and file no later than 2 workdays prior to the
actual payroll payment date. If the Acknowledgement of Processing Letters issued by NFC do not arrive
within 10 work days for payroll offices after the TSP file has been transmitted to NFC, contact the record-
keeper to determine if a processing letter was issued or what type of problem exists concerning the pro-
cessing cycle in question.


b. A TSP processing log shall be maintained to monitor TSP file transmissions to NFC. The log, at a min-
imum, must include report number, pay date, date of certification, date transmitted, date processed by
NFC and amounts processed. The contribution amounts contained on the original journal voucher (or cer-
tified listing) shall be compared with the processed TSP contributions per the Acknowledgment of Pro-
cessing Letters, the payroll Reject Report, and the TSP contributions per the Statement of Transactions to
ensure that the amounts processed by the Record keeper agree or can be reconciled with amounts submit-
ted by the paying DFAS center. The log need not be limited to the above items. It can include such addi-
tional data as date of initial run, recycle dates, date of the final run or other data that would be helpful in
the TSP file processing cycle.
672                                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



3. Correction Procedures.


a. NFC has published regulations governing the correction of errors (TSP Bulletin 97-3 and 98-21). Pro-
cedures for reporting payments and adjustments for previous calendar years are contained in TSP Bulletin
90-22.


b. DFAS payroll offices shall process TSP adjustments within 30 days of when the rejections or deletions
are received.


4. TSP Discrepancies.


a. TSP discrepancies are differences between amounts entered in and charges made by NFC to the DoD
Military TSP clearing account based on transactions transmitted to NFC on TSP files and adjustment
record input. The differences may be caused by changes made to the TSP file before it is sent to NFC,
where entries are not adjusted accordingly; or transactions that were rejected by NFC but were not resub-
mitted, resulting in no charge to the Military TSP clearing account.


b. The DFAS paying office shall ensure that all transactions involving money amounts submitted on the
TSP file or as adjustments have a corresponding entry.


100104 BREAKAGE (LOST TSP EARNINGS) DUE TO AGENCY ERROR For additional informa-
tion, see TSP Bulletins 90-39, 40, 41, and 42; 91-3 and 95-29


A. Title 5 C.F.R. Part 1606 implemented section 2 of P.L. 101-335, which provides statutory authority for
employing agencies to pay to the TSP amounts representing breakage (lost earnings) resulting from
agency errors. If a member receives pay from which member contributions should have been deducted,
but as a result of agency error, all or any part of those deductions were not made, then even if the member
makes up those member contributions, the belated member contributions shall not be subject to breakage.
No lost earnings are due on member contributions if the member had use of the funds. The following are
conditions that require payment of breakage:


1. If a member receives pay from which his or her contributions were properly deducted but, as a result
of an agency error, all or any part of the associated agency matching contributions were not timely
received by the TSP Recordkeeper, then the belated contributions will be subject to breakage.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            673


2. If a member receives pay from which his or her contributions were properly deducted but, as a result
of an agency error all or any part of those member contributions were not timely received by TSP record
keeper then the belated contribution will be subject to breakage.


3. Breakage on loan allotments and late contributions shall be calculated by the TSP system only for
those contributions and loan allotments that are $1 or more.


B. Agency Delay in Basic Pay. Where, as the result of an agency error (and not standard business prac-
tices), a member does not timely receive all or any part of pay to which entitled, all such belated member
contributions, and agency matching contributions shall be subject to breakage.


C. Late Payroll Submissions. All contributions contained in a payroll submission received by the TSP
Recordkeeper more than 30 days after the pay date associated with that payroll submission shall be sub-
ject to breakage.


D. Loan Allotments. Loan allotments deducted from an employee’s pay but not timely received by the
TSP Recordkeeper due to agency error shall be subject to breakage.


E. Minimum Dollar Amount. Breakage on loan allotments and late contributions shall be calculated by
the TSP system only for those contributions and loan allotments that are $1 or more.


F. Agency Responsibility. The paying service whose error caused a late or erroneous investment of
money in the TSP is responsible for payment of any breakage resulting from that error. The amount of
breakage that is calculated by TSP shall be charged to the TSP clearing account of the submitting paying
Service.


G. TSP Clearing Account. The paying office shall prepare the TSP record and the TSP-U-2-E
(REQUEST TO CALCULATE LOST EARNINGS: CERTIFICATION OF TRANSFER OF FUNDS
AND JOURNAL VOUCHER) for submission to NFC for processing and calculation of the breakage.
NFC shall forward detailed reports back to the paying office. The paying office shall prepare and process
an SF 1081(Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits) to charge the employing activity fund and
credit the TSP clearing account as reported on the TSP-U-2-E.


H. TSP Bulletins. For detailed information concerning the breakage (lost earnings) process, refer to TSP
Bulletins 90-39, 90-40, 90-41, 91-3, 91-4, 91-34, 92-29, 95-13, and 98-21. The TSP Bulletins are avail-
able on the Internet at http://www.tsp.gov.


100105. TSP LOAN PROGRAM.
674                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



A. General. Under 5 U.S.C. 8433(I), all current TSP participants are eligible to obtain a TSP loan. A max-
imum of two TSP loans per employee can be made on a current basis. For additional information, see TSP
Bulletin 96-33.


B. Types of Loans. Loans can be made for the following purposes:


1. Residential; and


2. General purpose.


C. Loan Amounts. The minimum amount of a TSP loan is $1,000. Members may borrow only their own
contributions and earnings. Current loan amounts may not exceed a total of $50,000.


D. Interest Rate. The interest rate shall be the posted rate for the G Fund at the time the terms of the loan
are established. The rate is fixed at that level for the life of the loan, and the interest paid on the loan shall
go back to the employee’s own TSP account and is not tax deductible.


E. Processing and Accounting Procedures.


1. The member’s payroll office shall receive Form TSP-U-22 (TSP Loan Payment Allotment Form) or an
electronic listing from NFC after a loan is issued to the member. An official at NFC must properly certify
this form. The certified Form TSP-U-22 or electronic listing from NFC shall contain the TSP loan num-
ber, pertinent employee data, the repayment information and the DD/EFT routing number.


2. Loan repayment via DD/EFT. TSP loan repayments may be established as either allotments or a deduc-
tion on the member’s Master Military Pay Account (MMPA). Accounting procedures are the same as
those currently used for disbursement of net pay and other types of allotments except the same type of
checkless remittance and TSP clearing account procedures used for TSP savings deductions are to uti-
lized.

PART I--GENERAL INFO


1. THE THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN IS A RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN
ESTABLISHED FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AS PART OF THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES'
RETIREMENT SYSTEM ACT OF 1986 (P.L. 99-335) WHICH HAS BEEN CODIFIED IN 5 U.S.C.
8431-8440D. PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN FOR UNIFORMED SERVICE MEMBERS WAS
AUTHORIZED BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FY 2000 (P.L. 106-65,
OCTOBER 5, 1999) AS AMENDED BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR
FY 2001 (P.L. 106-398, OCTOBER 30, 2000). THE PLAN OFFERS TAX DEFERRAL ADVANTAGES
SIMILAR TO THOSE IN AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) OR 401(K) PLAN.
THE FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD (FRTIB) WHICH OPERATES THE
PLAN SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES,
ADMINISTERS THE PLAN AND PUBLISHES REGULATIONS IN TITLE 5, CFR AND OPERAT-
ING GUIDANCE IN PERIODIC BULLETINS. THE NATIONAL FINANCE CENTER (NFC) IN NEW
ORLEANS, LOUISIANA IS THE TSP RECORDKEEPER.


2. FROM HEREON THE UNIFORMED SERVICES THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN WILL BE REFERRED
TO AS UNISERV TSP, TSP, OR THE PLAN.

MAKE THE ELECTION EFFECTIVE NO LATER THAN THE FIRST FULL PAY PERIOD AFTER
THE ELECTION IS RECEIVED WITH NO CONTRIBUTIONS BEING EFFECTIVE PRIOR TO THE
FIRST FULL PAY PERIOD IN JAN 02. NEW MEMBERS WHO DO NOT ENROLL DURING THIS
60-DAY PERIOD (AND THOSE WHO REJOIN FOLLOWING A BREAK IN SERVICE) WILL HAVE
TWO "OPEN SEASONS" PER YEAR TO ENROLL THEREAFTER.


B. CONTRIBUTIONS AND ELECTIONS.


1) THE TEMPORARY MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT OF BASIC PAY (COMPENSA-
TION RECEIVED UNDER SECTION 204 OR 206 OF TITLE 37 USC) MAY NOT EXCEED 7% OF
THE SAME FOR ANY PAY PERIOD BEGINNING IN CY2002. THIS LIMIT WILL BE INCREASED
ANNUALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING TABLE:


      PAY PERIOD BEGINNING IN CY      MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE
                2002                  7 PERCENT
                2003                  8 PERCENT
                2004                  9 PERCENT
                2005                  10 PERCENT
                2006 AND AFTER        UNLIMITED
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                  679



THOUGH THE LIMITATION ON CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BASIC PAY WILL BE INCREASED,
THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY NOT EXCEED THE LIMITATIONS
UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE DESCRIBED LATER.


2) SPECIAL, INCENTIVE, OR BONUS PAY. A MEMBER MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE
PLAN FROM BASIC PAY (OR FROM COMPENSATION RECEIVED UNDER SECTION 206 OF
TITLE 37) MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE UP TO 100 PERCENT OF ANY SPECIAL PAY, INCENTIVE
PAY, OR BONUS THAT THE MEMBER RECEIVES UNDER CHAPTER 5 OF TITLE 37, U.S.C.


3) A MEMBER'S ELECTION TO CONTRIBUTE FROM BASIC, INCENTIVE, SPECIAL AND/OR
BONUS PAY WILL BE EXPRESSED AS A WHOLE PERCENTAGE OF ANY SUCH PAYS.


4) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE MADE THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION.


5) EXCEPT FOR BONUSES, MEMBERS MUST MAKE ALL START/CHANGE CONTRIBUTION
ELECTIONS DURING AN OPEN SEASON. MEMBERS WHO HAVE MADE A VALID ELECTION
TO CONTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THEIR BASIC PAY TO THE TSP DURING AN OPEN SEASON
MAY MAKE AN ELECTION TO CONTRIBUTE FROM BONUS PAY AT ANY TIME.


6) MEMBERS MAY ELECT TO CONTRIBUTE SPECIAL, INCENTIVE, OR BONUS PAY IN
ANTICIPATION OF BECOMING ENTITLED TO IT IN THE FUTURE. SHOULD A MEMBER
MAKE SUCH AN ELECTION, THE ELECTION WILL TAKE EFFECT WHENEVER THE MEMBER
BECOMES ENTITLED TO SUCH PAY AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL CHANGED BY
THE MEMBER.


7) THE OPTION TO STOP CONTRIBUTING TO TSP IS PERMITTED AT ANY TIME. IT IS EFFEC-
TIVE AT THE END OF THE PAY PERIOD IN WHICH THAT ELECTION IS ACCEPTED BY THE
MEMBER'S SERVICING ACTIVITY.


A) MEMBERS WHO TERMINATE BASIC PAY CONTRIBUTIONS MUST TERMINATE ALL
OTHER ELECTIVE DEFERRALS. IF THE TERMINATION IS MADE OUTSIDE OF AN OPEN SEA-
SON, THE MEMBER MUST WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND OPEN SEASON FOLLOWING THE TER-
MINATION TO RE-ENROLL IN THE TSP. IF THE TERMINATION IS MADE DURING AN OPEN
SEASON, THE MEMBER MAY RE-ENROLL IN THE TSP DURING THE NEXT OPEN SEASON.


B) MEMBERS WHO TERMINATE SPECIAL, INCENTIVE, OR BONUS PAY CONTRIBUTIONS
NEED NOT TERMINATE BASIC PAY CONTRIBUTIONS. IF THE TERMINATION IS MADE OUT-
SIDE OF AN OPEN SEASON, THE MEMBER MUST WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND OPEN SEASON
680                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION TO REINSTATE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIAL OR
INCENTIVE PAY. IF THE TERMINATION IS MADE DURING AN OPEN SEASON, THE MEMBER
MAY REINSTATE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIAL OR INCENTIVE PAY DURING THE NEXT
OPEN SEASON.


8) MEMBERS OF THE READY RESERVE WHO ARE ORDERED TO PERFORM PERIODS OF
CONTINUOUS ACTIVE DUTY GREATER THAN 30 DAYS MAY MAKE TSP ELECTIONS OUT-
SIDE OF AN OPEN SEASON PROVIDED SUCH ELECTIONS ARE MADE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF
THE BEGINNING OF THE ACTIVE DUTY. CONVERSELY, MEMBERS ON ACTIVE DUTY WHO
ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE READY RESERVE IN ANY PAY STATUS MAY
MAKE TSP ELECTIONS OUTSIDE OF AN OPEN SEASON, PROVIDED SUCH ELECTIONS ARE
MADE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE BEGINNING OF THEIR READY RESERVE STATUS.


C. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE LIMITATIONS. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF TSP EMPLOYEE
CONTRIBUTIONS IS LIMITED BY TWO DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVE-
NUE CODE (IRC). THESE LIMITS APPLY IN ADDITION TO THE TEMPORARY LIMIT ON CON-
TRIBUTIONS FROM BASIC PAY. IF A MEMBER'S EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS EXCEED ANY
OF THESE LIMITATIONS, THE MEMBER MAY REQUEST A REFUND OF EMPLOYEE CONTRI-
BUTIONS (AND ASSOCIATED EARNINGS) FROM THE TSP ON THE FORM TITLED "REQUEST
FOR RETURN OF EXCESS EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PARTICIPANT," WHICH CAN BE
OBTAINED FROM THE TSP RECORD KEEPER. THE COMPLETED FORM MUST BE
RETURNED TO THE TSP RECORD KEEPER BY 20 FEB OF THE YEAR AFTER THE EXCESS
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE.


1) ELECTIVE DEFERRAL LIMIT. SECTION 402(G) OF THE IRC (26 U.S.C. 402(G)) PLACES A
DOLLAR LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT A PERSON MAY SAVE ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS
THROUGH RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS. THE LIMIT WAS RECENTLY INCREASED BY
LAW TO $11,000 FOR 2002 AND IS SCHEDULED TO INCREASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:


FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING        THE APPLICABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT:
      IN CALENDAR YEAR:
           2002                               $11,000
           2003                               $12,000
           2004                               $13,000
           2005                               $14,000
           2006 OR THEREAFTER                 $15,000
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                681


THE TSP WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY EMPLOYEE TAX-DEFERRED CONTRIBUTIONS THAT
EXCEED THE IRC SECTION 402(G) LIMIT. IF A SERVICE MEMBER CONTRIBUTES TO A
CIVILIAN TSP ACCOUNT OR TO ANOTHER QUALIFIED EMPLOYER PLAN DESCRIBED AT
IRC SECTIONS 401(K), 403(B), OR 408(K), AND THE TOTAL EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM TAXABLE INCOME MADE TO ALL PLANS EXCEED THE IRC SECTION 402(G) LIMIT,
HE OR SHE MAY REQUEST A REFUND OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TSP TO
CONFORM WITH THE LIMIT. (CONTRIBUTIONS FROM TAX-FREE COMBAT ZONE TAX
EXCLUSION AND QUALIFIED HAZARDOUS DUTY AREA COMPENSATION ARE NOT TAKEN
INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING THE APPLICATION OF THE IRC SECTION
402(G) LIMIT.)


2) SECTION 415(C) LIMIT ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO QUALIFIED PLANS. SECTION 415(C) OF
THE IRC (26 U.S.C. 415(C)) ALSO PLACES AN ANNUAL LIMIT ON THE COMBINED AMOUNT
THAT CAN BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TSP AND TO ALL OTHER QUALIFIED EMPLOYER
PLANS DESCRIBED UNDER SECTIONS 401(K), 403(B), OR 408(K) OF THE IRC. THE LIMIT
WAS RECENTLY CHANGED BY LAW AND IS NOW $40,000 PER TAX YEAR. FOR PURPOSES
OF APPLYING THIS LIMIT, THIS WOULD INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM TAX-FREE COM-
BAT ZONE AND QUALIFIED HAZARDOUS DUTY AREA COMPENSATION WHICH DO NOT
COUNT TOWARD THE AFOREMENTIONED ELECTIVE DEFERRAL LIMIT. NO EMPLOYEE
CONTRIBUTION MAY BE MADE TO THE TSP FOR ANY YEAR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
SUM OF THE EMPLOYEE'S AND EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TSP AND TO ALL
OTHER QUALIFIED EMPLOYER PLANS DESCRIBED UNDER SECTIONS 401(K), 403(B), OR
408(K) OF THE IRC WOULD EXCEED THE SECTION 415(C) LIMIT. IF A SERVICE MEMBER
CONTRIBUTES TO A CIVILIAN TSP ACCOUNT AND TO A MILITARY TSP ACCOUNT IN A
SINGLE CALENDAR YEAR, THE ANNUAL LIMIT WILL BE APPLIED TO THE TOTAL OF THE
CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOTH ACCOUNTS.


D. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM COMBAT ZONE TAX EXEMPT PAY. WHEN A MEMBER SERVES
IN A COMBAT ZONE TAX EXCLUSION AREA (OR OTHER ELIGIBLE AREA), MOST COMPEN-
SATION EARNED FOR ACTIVE SERVICE DURING A QUALIFIED MONTH IS EXCLUDED
FROM GROSS INCOME AND THEREFORE IS RECEIVED TAX FREE. ALL OF THE ENLISTED
MEMBER'S AND WARRANT OFFICER'S COMPENSATION IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS EXCLU-
SION. OFFICERS, HOWEVER, MAY EXCLUDE NO MORE THAN THE HIGHEST RATE OF
BASIC PAY PAID TO EACH SERVICE'S SENIOR ENLISTED MEMBER (PLUS ANY HAZARD-
OUS DUTY/IMMINENT DANGER PAY DUE THE UNCLAS SECTION 3 OF 5 OFFICER).


1) BECAUSE THE MEMBER RECEIVES NO TAX DEFERRAL BENEFIT FROM CONTRIBUTING
COMPENSATION THAT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM GROSS INCOME TO THE TSP, CONTRI-
BUTIONS FROM THIS COMPENSATION ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO
TAXATION WHEN WITHDRAWN FROM THE TSP.


2) IN A MONTH THAT AN OFFICER SERVES IN A COMBAT ZONE OR OTHER ELIGIBLE AREA
AND HAS TOTAL TAXABLE COMPENSATION THAT EXCEEDS THE HIGHEST RATE OF BASIC
682                                               AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


PAY PAID TO EACH SERVICE'S SENIOR ENLISTED MEMBER, CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE
TAKEN FROM TAX-EXCLUDED PAY FIRST (SO AS NOT TO COUNT TOWARD THE ELECTIVE
DEFERRAL LIMIT, THUS MAXIMIZING THE CONTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITY). CONTRIBU-
TIONS WILL BE TAKEN FROM TAXABLE COMPENSATION ONLY WHEN THE OFFICER IS
BOTH ELIGIBLE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN THE TAX-EXCLUDED AMOUNT AND HAS
MADE AN EFFECTIVE ELECTION TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT EXCEED THE
TAX-EXCLUDED AMOUNT.


3) WHEN A MEMBER CONTRIBUTES COMPENSATION TO THE TSP THAT HAS BEEN
EXCLUDED FROM INCOME UNDER IRC SECTION 112 (THE COMBAT ZONE TAX EXCLU-
SION), IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE IRC SECTION 402(G) ELECTIVE DEFERRAL LIMIT. HOW-
EVER, IT IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATION OF IRC SECTION 415(C). EVEN WHEN RECEIVED
IN A COMBAT ZONE, MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BASIC PAY (OR FROM PAY
RECEIVED UNDER SECTION 206 OF TITLE 37) STILL MAY NOT EXCEED THE TEMPORARY
MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT PERMITTED BY THE LAW.


E. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. AS A SPECIAL RETENTION INITIATIVE, REFERENCE (A)
AUTHORIZES THE SERVICE SECRETARY TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A MEM-
BER TO MAKE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE
MEMBER IF THE MEMBER IS IN A SPECIALTY DESIGNATED AS CRITICAL TO MEET WAR-
TIME OR PEACETIME REQUIREMENTS AND THE MEMBER COMMITS TO SERVE ON
ACTIVE DUTY IN THAT SPECIALTY FOR A PERIOD OF 6 YEARS. AT THIS TIME THE AIR
FORCE DOES NOT INTEND TO EXERCISE THIS AUTHORITY, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO USE
SPECIALTY-SPECIFIC BONUSES FOR RETENTION PURPOSES. WHEN AND IF THIS AUTHOR-
ITY TO USE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS IS USED, AFFECTED SPECIALTIES AND PROCE-
DURES WILL BE PUBLISHED WITHOUT DELAY.
3. TSP LOAN PROGRAM.


A. GENERAL. UNDER 5 U.S.C. 8433(I), TSP PARTICIPANTS ARE ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN TSP
LOANS. A MEMBER MAY HAVE A TOTAL OF TWO LOANS FOR THE FOLLOWING PUR-
POSES:


1) RESIDENTIAL (LIMITED TO ONE)


2) GENERAL PURPOSE (ONE OR TWO)


B. THE MINIMUM AMOUNT A MEMBER CAN BORROW IS $1,000.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                683


C. THE MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNT IS GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' RETIRE-
MENT SYSTEM ACT (FERSA) OF 1986 AND IRC SECTION 72(P). AT PRESENT, THE FOLLOW-
ING RULES APPLY:


1) A PARTICIPANT CAN NEVER BORROW MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PARTICI-
PANT'S OWN CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS.


2) IF A PARTICIPANT HAS NOT HAD A TSP LOAN OUTSTANDING DURING THE PAST YEAR,
AND THE PARTICIPANT'S CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS ARE $10,000 OR LESS, THE
PARTICIPANT CAN BORROW UP TO THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE PARTICIPANT'S CONTRI-
BUTIONS AND EARNINGS.


3) IF A PARTICIPANT HAS HAD A TSP LOAN OUTSTANDING DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS,
OR IF THE PARTICIPANT'S CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS ARE GREATER THAN $10,000,
THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD USE THE WORKSHEET IN THE TSP PUBLICATION ON LOANS
TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE PARTICIPANT IS ALLOWED TO BORROW.


4) A PARTICIPANT CANNOT BORROW MORE THAN $50,000.


5) WHEN A MEMBER HAS BOTH A CIVILIAN TSP ACCOUNT AND A UNISERV TSP
ACCOUNT, THE MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNT APPLIES TO THE COMBINED ACCOUNTS AND
NOT TO EACH ACCOUNT SEPARATELY.


D. INTEREST RATE. THE INTEREST RATE SHALL BE THE POSTED RATE FOR THE G FUND
AT THE TIME THE TERMS OF THE LOAN ARE ESTABLISHED. THE RATE IS FIXED AT THAT
LEVEL FOR THE LIFE OF THE LOAN, AND THE INTEREST PAID ON THE LOAN SHALL GO
BACK TO THE EMPLOYEE'S OWN TSP ACCOUNT. THE INTEREST PAID IS NOT TAX
DEDUCTIBLE.


E. TAX-EXEMPT AMOUNTS. WHEN A PARTICIPATING MEMBER HAS CONTRIBUTIONS
THAT ARE MADE FROM TAX-EXEMPT PAY AS WELL AS FROM TAX-DEFERRED PAY, THE
LOAN PRINCIPAL WILL BE MADE PROPORTIONALLY FROM BOTH TYPES OF FUNDS IN
THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT, AND LOAN REPAYMENTS WILL REPLENISH THE
TAX-DEFERRED AND TAX-EXEMPT AMOUNTS IN A SIMILAR PRO RATA BASIS.


F. LOAN REPAYMENT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PAYROLL DEDUCTION ONLY.


4. SEPARATION OPTIONS.
684                                              AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007



A. WHEN SEPARATING FROM THE UNIFORMED SERVICES, PARTICIPANTS MAY:


1) RECEIVE A SINGLE PAYMENT. ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT CAN BE TRANS-
FERRED TO AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) OR OTHER ELIGIBLE RETIRE-
MENT PLAN (E.G., A 401(K) PLAN OR A CIVILIAN TSP ACCOUNT). TAX-EXEMPT
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TSP ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER TO AN IRA OR OTHER
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE PAID DIRECTLY TO THE
SERVICEMEMBER. EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX-EXEMPT CONTRIBUTIONS,
HOWEVER, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER TO AN IRA OR OTHER ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT
PLAN. NOTE: A PARTICIPANT MAY BEGIN WITHDRAWING FROM THE ACCOUNT WITHOUT
PENALTY AT AGE 59 1/2. IF A MEMBER SEPARATES OR RETIRES BEFORE THE YEAR IN
WHICH HE/SHE TURNS AGE 55 AND WITHDRAWS ANY FUNDS FROM THE TSP BEFORE
AGE 59 1/2, THE FUNDS ARE TAXABLE AT ORDINARY RATES(EXCEPT ANY TAX-EXEMPT
CONTRIBUTIONS) AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 10 PERCENT EARLY WITHDRAWAL PEN-
ALTY.


2) REQUEST A SERIES OF MONTHLY PAYMENTS BASED ON A DOLLAR AMOUNT, A NUM-
BER OF MONTHS, OR THE PARTICIPANT'S LIFE EXPECTANCY. ALL OR A PORTION OF CER-
TAIN MONTHLY PAYMENTS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO AN IRA OR OTHER ELIGIBLE
RETIREMENT PLAN.


3) REQUEST A TSP ANNUITY. A PARTICIPANT MUST HAVE AT LEAST $3,500 IN THE
ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO PURCHASE AN ANNUITY.


4) LEAVE THE MONEY IN THE TSP WHERE IT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE EARNINGS.
NOTE: A PARTICIPANT MUST BEGIN WITHDRAWING FROM THE ACCOUNT NO LATER
THAN APRIL 1 OF THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE YEAR THE PARTICIPANT TURNS AGE 70 1/2.


B. FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR TSP SEPARATION OPTIONS,


1) THE RELEASE OF THE MEMBER FROM ACTIVE DUTY, NOT FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THE
FOLLOWING ACTIONS BEFORE THE END OF THE 31-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DAY
FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE RELEASE, WILL BE CONSIDERED A SEPARA-
TION FROM SERVICE.
A) A RESUMPTION OF ACTIVE DUTY


B) AN APPOINTMENT TO A POSITION COVERED BY CHAPTER 83 OR 84 OF TITLE 5 OR AN
EQUIVALENT RETIREMENT SYSTEM, AS IDENTIFIED BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                               685

2) TRANSFER OF THE MEMBER TO INACTIVE STATUS (EXCEPT FOR ASSIGNMENT TO THE

NOTES:
  1. The military pay of a member who is not residing in his or her state of legal residence is not taxed.
     There are no deductions for state income tax withholding (SITW) from the member's pay.
   2. The military pay of a member from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut or who met conditions of
      the "Three-Prong Test" is not taxed. The member must certify within 30 days of his or her PCS
      arrival (New York or New Jersey only) to prevent deductions of SITW from his or her pay. Mem-
      ber claiming Oregon need to complete the AF Form 2051-1, and member claiming Connecticut
      need to complete the CT-W4 one time, to prevent withholding of SITW.
   3. If a member is not residing in his or her state of legal residence and no deduction is currently
      being made for SITW from the normal monthly pay, no SITW is deducted from one-time entitle-
      ments. This applies to members discussed in Notes 1 and 2.
   4. The commonwealth of Puerto Rico is technically not a state; however, a state code has been
      assigned and Puerto Rico Income Tax is to be withheld from members claiming Puerto Rico as
      their legal residence.
   5. West Virginia tax applies only to Guard and Reserve member's pay.
   6. Do not use state code 98 in either an A06, establish/update MMPA with tax information, or an
      A26, state tax transaction.

                     SYSOUT ARCHIVE AND RETRIEVAL (SAR) SYSTEM

A8.1. General.
   A8.1.1. The Sysout Archive and Retrieval System (SAR), which has recently been renamed Com-
   puter Associates View (CAView), is a mainframe reports delivery application. It allows for the on-line
   reading and display of printed reports without actually having the reports printed, thereby saving
   paper and storage space.
   A8.1.2. Used in conjunction with CA View/Prevail/XP software, which is installed on individual per-
   sonal computer workstations, reports may be downloaded from SAR/View on the Denver Megacenter
   mainframe to individual PCs.
   A8.1.3. If printing is necessary, hardcopy can be produced of either an entire report or portions of it,
   by either printing directly from SAR/VIEW off the mainframe or printing from a user’s PC after
   downloading the report file from SAR/VIEW to the CA View/Prevail/XP software.

A8.2. Accessing Sar/View On The Mainframe.
   A8.2.1. Sign onto DynaComm Elite with the user’s normal DJMS ID and password:


                      User ID ==> JCXXX00 press <tab>
                      Password ==> XXXXXXX press <enter>


   A8.2.2. At the main menu screen, select CICSJ3 by tabbing down and keying “S” (no quotes) on the
   line next to the desired option, then press <enter>.
   A8.2.3. When the screen displays the message “Sign on is complete”, type SAR and press <enter>.

A8.3. Using SAR/View For First Time.
   A8.3.1. Your user ID will automatically be set up to default for the most commonly used report cate-
   gory based on your work area -- example: JFRVCH1 (for central site users). The available distribution
   IDs and report categories are listed in Attachment 1. BE SURE TO USE ONLY THE DISTRIBU-
   TION AND REPORT IDS LISTED FOR AIR FORCE AT THIS TIME!

A8.4. Using SAR/View After Initial Sign-On.
   A8.4.1. The values displayed on the main screen will not change from the last time SAR/VIEW was
   used.
   A8.4.2. To change a distribution ID in order to look at DJMS reports in other SAR/VIEW regions:
      A8.4.2.1. At the COMMAND LINE ==> type in the word MODE and the desired Distribution
      ID, such as JFRVCH1:
               Example: COMMAND LINE ==> MODE JFRVCH1
766                                                                   AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         A8.4.2.2. Then, press <enter>.
         A8.4.2.3. From the COMMAND LINE ==>, tab to SCROLL. Change PAGE to CSR. This will
         allow the user to move the keyboard cursor down into the report on the screen and press PF8 to
         move that line the cursor is on to the top of the screen. This will also allow the user to work with
         lines as opposed to whole pages.

A8.5. Viewing the Reports List in SAR/View.
      A8.5.1. To view only the latest reports created (that is, the last daily, coded, monthly, quarterly, and
      yearly reports):
         A8.5.1.1. Set the REPORT ID ==> to (asterisk) “*” (no quotes), which will provide every report
         for that particular Distribution ID. (A list of the reports available for each Distribution ID is avail-
         able in Attachment 1.)
         A8.5.1.2. The SELECTION BY DATE ==> field can be left blank unless a report for a specific
         date is required.
         A8.5.1.3. At the present time, the only acceptable value for the SELECT BY ==> field is R.
         A8.5.1.4. Once all fields are completed, press <enter>. Now, each time SAR/VIEW is accessed,
         these selections will be made automatically, unless the defaults are intentionally changed.
      A8.5.2. To view all the reports currently stored on SAR/VIEW on the mainframe, at the SELECTION
      BY COPY: PREVIOUS COPY NO. ==> field, type the word “ALL” (no quotes). This will display all
      the reports currently available in SAR/VIEW.
      A8.5.3. To view a specific report, change the REPORT ID ===> to the specific report name, i.e,
      FR0167*. This will allow SAR/VIEW to display the latest daily and coded UH022-167 report. If all
      the UH022-167 reports currently on-line are desired, make sure the SELECTION BY COPY says
      ALL.

A8.6. Subsequent Access. Repeat the steps in sections B through E.

A8.7. Changing SAR/View Defaults. The default settings can be changed by following the instructions
in section D2.

A8.8. Report Viewing in SAR/View.
      A8.8.1. When the list of reports is displayed, select the report to be viewed.
         A8.8.1.1. Tab down to the line which displays the correct report number, name and date, type “S”
         (no quotes), and press <enter>. The selected report will appear.
         A8.8.1.2. To view the full width of the report, at the command line, press the PF10 key to move
         left in the report or the PF11 key to move right in the report. If the user wants to view the entire
         report on the screen, at the first warning screen for DynaComm Elite, type NMP5, instead of NMP,
         to get the main sign-in screen. This will automatically size the maximum width of the page being
         viewed to the screen.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                            767


     A8.8.1.3. It is also possible to move around inside the report by pressing the HOME key to return
     to the COMMAND LINE ==> and typing the word right or left (for the direction you wish to
     move), followed by the number of spaces desired.
     A8.8.1.4. To move toward the top of the page, press <PF7>. Press <PF8> to move toward the bot-
     tom.
     A8.8.1.5. Press <PF3> to exit the report.
  A8.8.2. If a request to view a report generates a message (which will appear in the upper right corner
  of the screen) reading “NO MOUNT AUTHORITY,” or if the desired report reads PTAP in the col-
  umn under the heading LOC, the report has been archived, and must be retrieved before it can be
  viewed.
     A8.8.2.1. Tab down to the desired report and type “L” (no quotes); press <enter>. This will load
     the report.
     A8.8.2.2. Repeat for each report needed.
     A8.8.2.3. To complete the job and load the reports to temporary storage on the mainframe: at the
     COMMAND LINE ==>, type SUB and press <enter>.
     A8.8.2.4. When the JOB screen appears, press <enter>. The screen will clear, except for a mes-
     sage stating “JOB SUBMITTED”. Press <enter> one more time to get back to the report list
     screen.
     A8.8.2.5. After about 10 minutes, the report list will show this report as PTMP under the LOC
     heading. However, in order for the change to register on the Report List screen, it is necessary to
     press PF3 to exit the screen during the loading process. Either work on another report or do some-
     thing else for this short time.
     A8.8.2.6. Once a report is loaded, it will remain active only until the next mainframe system
     backup. These are run on an 8-hour window, beginning at 0600 hours daily; the next backup is run
     at 1400 hours. Whenever a backup is run, any reports which have been loaded return to their status
     prior to having been loaded, and must be reloaded in order to be viewed. Be aware of the time
     when loading a report; if it is too near a scheduled backup, there might not be sufficient time to
     view the report before it is returned to storage!
  A8.8.3. Search (Find) within a report on the DJMS mainframe: To save time when viewing all of a
  lengthy report in order to find a specific bit of information, use this feature to search for the desired
  section.
     A8.8.3.1. At the COMMAND LINE ==>, type F (space) ‘ (apostrophe) the section desired ‘
     (apostrophe). For example, to find only sections of the report which deal with DSSN 3838, type F
     ‘DSSN:3838’. Or to find TD 75, type: F ‘TD: 75’. (Be sure that to type the item to be found
     exactly as it looks in the report.)
     A8.8.3.2. When looking for just a number, type a space on both sides of the number sought: for
     example, f (space) 6051(space). The apostrophes are not required in this situation.
     A8.8.3.3. To use this feature, the item requested in the ‘find’ request must be in exactly the same
     format used in the report. In other words, when searching for a Social Security Number, be sure to
768                                                                    AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         include dashes (111-22-3344) if the report uses dashes, but do not include them (111223344) if the
         report leaves them out.
         A8.8.3.4. If, for some reason, a search needs to be repeated, using exactly the same request, press
         <PF5> to repeat it without having to re-key the request. (This assumes that no other request has
         been keyed in the interim.) The repeat shortcut can be used especially when searching through
         more than one report for the same information.

A8.9. Printing Reports Directly from the Main Frame (SAR/View).
      A8.9.1. Reports can be printed directly from SAR/VIEW or by using Prevail/XP/CA View in con-
      junction with SAR/VIEW. In general, it is easier to print using Prevail/XP/CA View. Instructions for
      printing from the PC to the LAN printer are found in the Prevail/XP/CA View for the Personnel Com-
      puter section. The report can be printed in part or in total.
      A8.9.2. To print an entire report to a mainframe systems printer (This function is normally utilized
      only by auditors within a section.)
      FIRST OF ALL, BE CERTAIN THE ENTIRE REPORT REALLY IS NEEDED - DO NOT
      PRINT ENTIRE REPORTS WHEN ONLY SECTIONS ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED!
         A8.9.2.1. At the Report Selection List screen, tab down to the desired report, type “P” (no quotes)
         to the left of the selected report, and press <enter>.
         A8.9.2.2. The next screen will show the REPORT ID selected along with its description. There
         will be a box on the screen. If this is the first request for this function, it may be necessary to enter
         the following:


                         CLASS ==> V
                         DEST ==> VPS.XXXXXXXX
                                 (the VPS is the VTAM address of the printer, such as
                                 J03CF617.)


                                 Press <enter>.


         A8.9.2.3. If the print request is successful, the report list screen appears. It takes between 10 and
         30 minutes for a report to print directly from the mainframe to the systems printer attached to the
         mainframe.
      A8.9.3. See section J, below, for printing parts of a report.

A8.10. Marking Selections Portions of a Report for Printing.
      A8.10.1. At the Report Selection List screen, tab down to the desired report and type “S” (no quotes),
      and press <enter>.
AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                769


   A8.10.2. Move to the beginning of the section to be downloaded or printed, using either <PF8> or the
   Search/Find feature described above in section H3.
NOTE: To mark pages or lines (if the report is listed as consisting of one page), the SCROLL option in
the upper right hand corner of the screen must be set to CSR instead of PAGE.
       A8.10.2.1. At the COMMAND LINE ==> type “MARK PAGE” or “MARK LINE” (no quotes);
       press <enter>.
       A8.10.2.2. Move to the end of the section, again using either <PF8> or Search/Find. (Suggestion:
       When using the Search/Find feature, enter the information for the section following the one to be
       printed or downloaded. Example: to print TD: 15, enter that at the beginning, then enter TD: 16 to
       reach the end of the section for TD: 15.
       A8.10.2.3. At the COMMAND LINE ==> type “MARK”; press <enter>.
       A8.10.2.4. Press <PF3> to exit the report and return to the Report Selection List screen.
   A8.10.3. As before, tab to the desired report and type “P” (no quotes); press <enter>.
   A8.10.4. Proceed as in section I above to print directly to a mainframe printer, or following proce-
   dures below to download the file to a personal computer for use with the Prevail/XP/CA View soft-
   ware.
NOTE: DFAS-DE Central Site users may sign off SAR/VIEW once the print command has been exe-
cuted.
   A8.10.5. To Print Using Prevail/XP/CA View, see the section on using Prevail/XP/CA View on a per-
   sonal computer (section O).

A8.11. Using SAR\View in Conjunction with Prevail/XP/CA View.
   A8.11.1. First go into SAR/VIEW on the mainframe and select the desired report as in sections D, E,
   and J above.
   A8.11.2. To queue the report for downloading of a print file to a personal computer containing Pre-
   vail/XP/CA View software:
       A8.11.2.1. At the Report Selection List screen, tab down to the desired report, type “P” (no
       quotes) to the left of the selected report, and press <enter>.
       A8.11.2.2. The next screen will show the REPORT ID selected along with its description. There
       will be a box on the screen. If this is the first request for this function, it may be necessary to enter
       the following:


                       CLASS ==> V
                       DEST ==> PC.JCXXX00


            (This is the user’s DJMS user ID. The “PC.” tells SAR/CA VIEW that this is a file to be
       downloaded to a personal computer. Press <enter>.
       A8.11.2.3. After confirming that the CLASS and DEST data is correct, press <enter>.
770                                                                   AFMAN65-116V3 15 MARCH 2007


         A8.11.2.4. The next screen displays the report that has seen selected with a statement: SYSOUT
         QUEUED for PC.
      A8.11.3. Press <ALT> and <TAB> simultaneously to arrive at Program Manager, which will appear
      as a box with various icons.
      A8.11.4. Double click on the icon for CA View or LEGENT PREVAIL/XP PRINTS.
      A8.11.5. Double click on CA View or PREVAIL/XP VIEW.
      A8.11.6. Go to section L if this is the first time using Prevail/XP/CA View. Go to section M to con-
      tinue with the procedures to download a SAR/VIEW report file to a personal computer.

A8.12. First Time Use of Prevail/XP or CA View on a Personal Computer.
      A8.12.1. First-time use of Prevail/XP (see below for first time use of CA View).
         A8.12.1.1. Click once on Options, which will then display two options: SELECT DEFAULT
         FONT and SELECT PRINTER FONT
         A8.12.1.2. Click once on DEFAULT FONT. A box will appear which gives point sizes and char-
         acter sets (the larger the size, the easier the report will be to read on the screen.) A suggested size
         is 15 pt ANSI. Select the desired size; when finished, click on “OK” to close this window box.
         A8.12.1.3. Now, return to Options and click once on PRINTER FONT to set the default font for
         all printing jobs. Again, a window box will appear with various font styles, sizes, and other
         options. Suggested choices here are Courier New, 8 pt, Bold. This will allow very wide reports to
         be printed on standard 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper. Click on “OK” to close this window
         A8.12.1.4. Click on the File option. When the drop-down window appears, click once on Print
         Setup. Click on “Landscape” or wide reports will not print correctly.
CAUTION: When Prevail/XP is exited, the software defaults back to “Portrait” for Print Setup. Be sure
to check this setup before printing each time.
         A8.12.1.5. Click on REMOTE and CONFIGURE CONNECTION. Click on HLLAPI. In the next
         WINDOW, in the box named HLLAPI TYPE, select IRMA for Windows. In the box named SES-
