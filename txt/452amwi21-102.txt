1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Tool control is the responsibility of all personnel of the 452d Air Mobility Wing.
     Commanders will ensure compliance with this directive.
2. Policies.
     2.1. Squadrons will establish a tool control program in accordance with (IAW) this AMWI
     and AFI21-101_AFRCSUP_I, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, Chapter
     10. Units with specific, published tool control guidance will follow those directives,
     provided the intent of this instruction for inventory, lost tool notification and control and
     accountability is achieved.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. Each squadron will ensure primary and alternate tool control custodians are designated
     in writing for applicable sections and flights that use tools during everyday operation.
     Satellite Services Incorporated (SSI) personnel and 452d Civil Engineering Squadron’s
     Power Production Shop. Vehicle Maintenance Flight, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and
     all aircraft maintenance organizations). These custodians will be responsible for the
     operation of the tool control program in their respective areas. Technical Orders, checklists,
     job guides, aircraft G files and laptops used for electronic and digital TOs are part of the tool
     control program when taken to the airfield job site and for all aircraft maintenance
     operations. When removed from the immediate file area, TOs and/or digital technical order
     system (DTOS) laptops will be checked using the Tool Accountable System (TAS), AF Form
     1297, Temporary Issue Hand Receipt, or AF Form 614, Charge Out Record, when TAS is
     not available.
     3.2. Tool Pouches. Canvas or other non-metallic tool pouches are authorized. If used, tool
     pouches will be part of the CTK and marked accordingly. Personnel may remove tools from
     a properly inventoried CTK and place them in a tool pouch. A complete CTK inventory will
     be accomplished as often as necessary. Return the tools to their shadowed positions prior to
     turn in. During intake maintenance procedures, all tools that are used will be kept in a
     cloth/canvass tool pouch except when in use. Tools will not be placed/stored on the
     protective intake mat.
     3.3. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Pouches. FOD Pouches will be made available for use
     with every dispatchable toolbox. FOD pouches that are included in the dispatchable kit will
     be shadowed or attached to the CTK and will be included on the inventory list.
452AMWI21-102 25 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   3


   3.4. Reflective Tape. Fire extinguishers and all hazardous obstacles on or adjacent to the
   flight line shall be marked with reflective material. This tape will be of sufficient size and
   length to ensure visibility during hours of darkness.
   3.5. CTKs used strictly in an off-equipment environment, non-dispatchable, may be left
   open for all personnel to use during a shift. The CTK will be inventoried whenever opened
   or closed.
   3.6. Keys will be controlled in the same manner as CTKs.
4. Tool Storage Facility/Tool Room.
   4.1. A controlled area within a work center designated for storage and issue of tools and
   equipment.
   4.2. Tool replacement will be one-for-one and is the responsibility of the tool custodian.
   4.3. Limited quantities of spare/replacement tools are authorized to be retained within the
   work center’s tool control area. Each work center will maintain a current inventory of the
   type, quantity and location of spare/replacement tools. A documented inventory of these
   tools and equipment will be accomplished quarterly. Spare/replacement tools will not be
   etched. The work center will ensure strict control of spare/replacement tools.
   4.4. Expendable and consumable tools/items used to perform aircraft maintenance and not
   included in a CTK will be controlled as required. Regardless of condition, these items will
   be returned to the tool control custodian for FOD control purposes. Proper disposal will be
   conducted by the tool control custodian.
   4.5. In aircraft maintenance and AFE work centers, shop towels and rags are not disposable
   or consumable and will be controlled as tools and replaced on a one-for-one basis. Other
   work centers working anywhere within the boundary of the airfield will utilize a locally
   developed means of positive rag control.
   4.6. Issued personal protective equipment (i.e., headsets, ear defenders, reflective belts, etc.)
   will be identified with a Tool Accountability System (TAS) / TCMax identifier. Aircrew
   personal protective equipment will be marked and controlled IAW technical orders and 452d
   Operations Group instructions. Units will determine applicable accountability and turn-in
   requirements. All items will be accounted for prior to entry into and departure from an
   aircraft.
   4.7. Warranty Tools. The CTK custodian(s) control warranty tools by identifying warranty
   tools and ensuring broken or damaged warranty tools are isolated from other broken or
   damaged tools and under strict control until replaced or exchanged.
   4.8. When a depot team, factory representative or Contract Field Team (CFT) performs
   maintenance on equipment within the 452d Maintenance Group, they will follow this
   instruction and AFI 21-101_AFRC_Sup I, Aerospace Equipment and Maintenance
   Management, Chapter 10 for tool accountability. If the contractor or team has not made
   provisions for tool control and accountability, the team leader/supervisor will coordinate with
   the Quality Assurance (QA) office to develop a program. The guidelines developed will be
   put into letter form, signed by the team leader/supervisor and routed to the 452 MXG/CC for
   approval. The team leader/supervisor and the QA office will maintain a copy of this letter
   for the duration of the team’s stay.

     Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) or other programmed deployment vulnerability periods
5. Aircraft Maintenance and Aircrew Flight Equipment Tool Identification and Location.
     5.1. Units assigned or attached to the 452d Maintenance Group and the 452d Operations
     Support Squadron (OSS) AFE will mark their tools with the standard nine-digit Equipment
     Identification Designator (EID) consisting of numbers and letters of which the first four
     characters will be a unique World Wide Identification (WWID) code. Conspicuously etch,
     stamp or mark each assigned tool room, CTKs, tools, special equipment and dispatchable
     equipment with the tool kit identifying number (IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10, Para 10.5).
     5.2. All padlocks and keys that are used to secure tool kits will be etched with the
     appropriate WWID and included on the inventory.
     5.3. All kits and toolboxes will be marked with easy to read letters and numbers that are
     visible when boxes are closed and locked. Additionally, all toolboxes that are used on the
     flight line will have reflective tape installed in such a way that it is visible from all four sides.
6. Marking and Tool Identification using TAS/TCMax.
     6.1. All non maintenance units can mark their tools with the standard EID and utilize the
     AF-approved TAS/TCMax provided they contact the 452 MXG Quality Assurance office for
     assignment of the third and fourth character for shop identification. Contractors and Most
     Efficient Organization (MEOs) are not required to use the EID until the contract requires the
     use of TAS/TCMax.
     6.2. The first two letters of the WWID in the EID for units within the 452 AMW are U4.
     6.3. The third and fourth characters designate the unit or shop. (See Attachment 1)
     6.4. The unit establishes the remaining five characters (any combination                          of
     numbers/letters)for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.
     6.5. Tools will be marked with the most current EID. All previous CTK identifiers will
     either be removed or marked out (this does not include Precision Measurement Equipment
     Laboratory (PMEL) markings.)
     6.6. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as drill bits, Allen
     wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked with the WWID and an
     identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK along with the number of tools
     contained. The container is counted as one of the items.
7. Marking and Tool Numbering/Equipment Identification System for all Non-
Maintenance Work Centers.
     7.1. All kits and toolboxes will be marked with easy to read letters and numbers that are
     visible when boxes are closed or locked. Additionally, all toolboxes that are used on the
     flight line will have reflective tape installed in such a way that it is visible from all four sides.
452AMWI21-102 25 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   5


   7.2. Mobility toolboxes: Units with mobility boxes will follow the same identification
   procedures as outlined in this instruction and have the weight and cubic inches applied on
   each end of the box IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.
8. Hazardous Materials.
   8.1. Rag and Disposable Glove Control.
      8.1.1. Marking or identifying each rag or disposable glove with a CTK number is not
      necessary. However, rags/disposable gloves will be controlled like any other dispatchable
      tool; therefore, tool rooms and work sections will issue and receipt rags/disposable gloves
      on a one-for-one basis. These items may also be issued in pre-packaged containers with
      the number of rags/disposable gloves marked on the outside of the container.
      8.1.2. Units will ensure rags and gloves with hazardous waste are separated from
      reusable rags.
9. Missing/Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   9.1. Any item lost or discovered missing in the aircraft maintenance complex, airfield
   operating area, or on aircraft can cause foreign object damage to the aircraft. It is imperative
   that all items lost or missing in these areas be immediately reported. It is especially important
   to report personally issued equipment items such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),
   aircrew flying and non-flying gear and special duty equipment that is not controlled IAW this
   MARBI.
   9.2. IMMEDIATELY upon discovering a missing item or tool, the person identifying the
