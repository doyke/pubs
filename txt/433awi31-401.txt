1. Appointments and Responsibilities.

1.1. Commander/Staff Agency Chiefs will:

1.1.1. As the responsible officer in charge of the Information Security Program, appoint in
writing a Primary and Alternate SM to manage the Information and Personnel Security
2                                                       433AWI31-401 12 DECEMBER 2008

Programs. The unit Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) should be a full time
employee of the organization. Larger units/sections are encouraged to appoint security monitors
at each section to assist the SM. Forward the original appointment letter to 37 SFS/S5IP and a
copy to 433 Security Forces Squadron/ Security Forces Administration (SFS/SFA). Ensure SM
receives training within 90 days of appointment and attend refresher training annually. The
security manager training is conducted by 37 SFS/S5IP.

1.1.2. Designate someone in writing to conduct the semi annual Information Security Program
Self Inspection. Security Managers cannot conduct their own self-inspections. File a copy with
the final report in your security manager handbook. Inspector uses the localized Security
Managers checklist to complete the inspection for cleared or uncleared accounts. Self Inspections
are conducted 6 months after the initial program review conducted by 37 SFS/S5IP.

1.1.3. Designate a Primary and Alternate TSCO and identify personnel who are authorized to
review Top Secret material.

1.1.4. Designate in writing, Safe/Classified Custodians and those who have access to safe
combinations and personnel to perform end of day security checks utilizing Standard Form (SF)
701, Activity Security Checklist.

1.1.5. Review position codes in the Unit Manpower Document (UMD). Review Joint Personnel
Adjudication System monthly to ensure clearance eligibility & access requirements are
consistent with mission needs. Document this review and file in the SMs handbook.

1.1.6. Designate in writing, personnel authorized to receive classified material and forward the
original letter to the 433 Communications Flight/Information Systems Flight (CF/SCB) and 433d
Airlift Wing/Command Post (AW/CP). Designate in writing personnel authorized to open the
inner wrappers of classified material and who can have access to classified material. Maintain
file copies in the unit security manager’s handbook.

1.2. SM will:

1.2.1. Maintain a SM’s handbook as outlined in the AFI 31-401, Air Education Training
Command (AETC) Sup 1, Para 1.3.6.10 and 1.3.6.11.

1.2.2. Develop Internal Security Operating Instructions (OIs) and include them as part of the
unit initial indoctrination and recurring training programs.

1.2.3. A knowledgeable person must be assigned to conduct self-inspections. Security managers
will not conduct self-inspections within their known directorate/unit; however, they are normally
the most qualified individuals to inspect programs outside their directorate/unit and
commanders/staff agency chiefs are encouraged to utilize them in that role. Monitor the
inspection and ensure the commander reviews and endorses the report, and forward a copy of the
report with identified corrective action to the ISPM. Maintain the last two self-inspection reports
in the SM’s handbook.
433AWI31-401 12 DECEMBER 2008                                                                    3

accordance with AFI 31-401, Information Security Management Program, Chapter 8 and
attachment 7. The training as a minimum should include Initial Security Education Orientation

Organization (NATO) Training, and Continuing and Refresher Training. Training will be
conducted via the Aeronautical Data Link System (ADLS) Website under Total Force
Awareness Training and Information Protection Training.

1.2.9. Ensure authorized personnel conduct Foreign Travel Briefings.

1.2.10. Ensure computer security officers are assigned to the unit.

1.2.11. Coordinate restricted area badge and AF Form 2586, Unescorted Entry Authorization
Certificate, issues with 433 SFS/SFA and 37 Security Forces Squadron/Pass and Registration
Section (SFS/S5B).

1.2.12 SMs will develop and maintain a list of security containers, vaults, and secure rooms
located in their organization and include in their security manager’s handbook. This list will
include make, Identification (ID) number, lock type, and location.

2. Classification or declassification of classified material or information:

2.1. 4 Air Force/Commander (AF/CC) has been designated as a Secret Original Classification
Authority (OCA). The authority to originally classify information will be exercised sparingly and
only when no promulgated classification guidance exists.

3. Classification challenges:

information is received which is believed to be improperly classified, or an overly restricted
period of continued classification has been assigned, the ISPM and security manager will be
contacted.
4                                                       433AWI31-401 12 DECEMBER 2008

3.2. The classified information being challenged will be safeguarded at the highest level of
classification. If the information is SECRET and the challenge is for downgrading to
CONFIDENTIAL, the information must still be safeguarded as SECRET until the challenge has
been resolved.

3.3. The ISPM and SM will ensure challenges are acted upon within thirty (30) days.

4. Marking Classified Information:

4.1. The originator of classified information is responsible for proper application of
Classification markings. The ultimate responsibility rests with the approver or signer of the
document or material.

respective SM and review DoD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5, and the Information Security Oversight
Office’s Marking Classified Nation Security Information Book.

5. Safekeeping and Storage:

5.1. Offices storing small numbers of classified documents that do not warrant an entire
Security container (approved General Services Administration (GSA) safe) may request courtesy
storage from another office. In this case, a letter of agreement between the two offices is
maintained in the safe with the documents. Additionally, the documents must be separated from
the safe contents by placing them in a sealed envelope/container.

5.2. Safe Custodians. The persons listed on the SF 700, Security Container Information, are
considered safe custodians. Safe custodian responsibilities:

5.2.1. Ensure safe combinations are changed as required.

combination no longer requires access; when the combination has been subject to compromise;
at least every 2 years; or when taken out of service.

5.3. Report container malfunction to 37 Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) customer service desk.

5.4. Ensure all documents placed in the safe are properly marked.

files should be limited to specifically labeled folders and stored separately from the contents
identified in the file plan.

5.6. Become familiar with Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20F-2, Inspection and Preventative
Maintenance Procedures for Classified Storage Containers, requirements.
433AWI31-401 12 DECEMBER 2008                                                                    5

5.7. Properly mark each safe with an easily identifiable number (for example, XP-01)
permanently attached to the exterior so it can be identified after natural disasters.

5.8. Emergency protection and removal of classified material:

5.8.1. The possibility of fire, civil disturbance, terrorist activity, or natural disaster at Lackland
Air Force Base (AFB), Texas (TX) requires development and possible implementation of special
procedures for safeguarding and emergency removal of classified material to preclude the
material from falling into unauthorized hands. A situation may develop that requires higher
headquarters, 4th AF/CC, 433 AW/CC or a designated representative to direct implementation of
emergency protection or removal of classified material.

Training Assembly (UTA)s. All other investigations must be completed within 30 days of the
initial notification, but the goal is 14 days. Failure to submit required paperwork on time is
