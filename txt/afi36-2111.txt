                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose: LCBP is a premier 2-year developmental program with a potential 1-year follow
on assignment to the same installation, where officers are competitively selected and developed
as acquisition officers with the potential to fill future materiel leader/senior materiel leader and
maintenance commander positions in the Air Force and Joint logistics systems. Officers selected
for this program gain valuable knowledge and experience in managing the acquisition and
sustainment aspects of the Air Force logistics system through rotational assignments in various
functional areas of Air Logistics Complexes (ALCs), the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center
(AFNWC), and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). All career broadening officers (CBOs)
will be required to obtain a level I certification in both Life Cycle Logistics (LCL) and Program
Management (PM) for program completion. After the 2-year program is complete, the final year
can be used at the discretion of the ALC Deputy Commander for Maintenance (ALC/DCM), the
AFNWC Vice Commander (AFNWC/CV), and Defense Logistics Agency Primary Level Field
Activity (DLA PLFA) Commander to allow CBOs to gain additional experience within ALC,
AFNWC, and DLA functional areas. This additional year can also be used to complete LCL
level II certification provided the CBO is in an Life Cycle Logistics (“L” coded) position.
Normal assignment rules apply when PCSing to this program.
1.2. Eligible Career Fields: LCBP is an AF/A4/7 sponsored AFMC training program that
applies to officers in the following Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs): 21R (Logistics
Readiness), 21A/M (Aircraft Maintenance, Munitions and Missile Maintenance), 61X
(Scientist), 62E (Engineer), 63A (Acquisition Manager), 64PX (Contracting), and 65FX
(Financial Management). For DLA positions, only the 21R AFSC is eligible to participate. For
AFNWC positions, only 21M AFSC is eligible to participate, with core nuclear officers
receiving priority placement.
1.3. Description: This program provides work experience in all areas of acquisition logistics
and sustainment and explains relationships between ALC logistics functions. Officers rotate
through designated wing(s) or directorates as prescribed in paragraph 2.1. While in each
organization, participants learn how different functions work together and are given tasks that
support mission needs while reinforcing concepts to be learned. Rotation through every wing or
directorate is desired, but the rotation process is designed to provide participants exposure to the
key elements of acquisition and life cycle logistics to maximize learning.
AFI36-2111 4 APRIL 2011                                                                          5


                                           Chapter 2

                               PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Program Phases: The three designated phases of the program, the objectives and the
mandatory education requirements are as follows:
   2.1.1. Phase I: Orientation. This phase consists of in-processing, initial acquisition training,
   and an Air Force Materiel Command introductory conference. This phase lasts approximately
   one month.
   2.1.2. Phase II: Rotations. This is a 20-month long work-and-learn phase emphasizing
   professional growth and active participation. Throughout this phase, CBOs will continue to
   complete logistics and acquisition courses from Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
   and Defense Acquisition University (DAU), professional development seminars, and tours.
   This phase consists of three 6 to 8-month flexible rotations, defined as Phase IIA, Phase IIB,
   and Phase IIC. From the ALCs, LCBP participants will obtain experience in the Supply
   Chain Management, Depot Maintenance, and PM mission areas. Each CBO will complete
   one rotation in each of these three mission areas, in any sequence. Within the Supply Chain
   Management and PM mission areas, one of the rotations should be accomplished within a
   “commodity” area and the other rotation should be in a “weapon system” area. The first
   rotation through the three mission areas begins after completion of Phase I. CBOs assigned
   to the DLA PFLA will obtain experience in Demand/Supply Planning, Acquisition, Weapon
   System Support, Contingency Planning and Supply Chain Management using a similar
   approach as the ALCs. CBOs assigned to the AFNWC will obtain nuclear unique experience
   in joint DOE/DOD warhead/bomb management and transport, weapon systems management,
   maintenance and equipment, nuclear surety and certifications, acquisitions and modifications,
   accident/incident response and supply chain management.
   2.1.3. Phase III: Two Options. With the approval of the ALC, AFNWC or DLA PLFA
   Commanders, the officer may elect one of two options for the remaining 3-months of the
   program: extension of Phase II rotations to compensate for training, leave, or other out of
   rotation time or the addition of an abbreviated rotation via temporary duty (TDY) in another
   ALC or ICP area.
2.2. Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) Certifications: All CBOs are
required to obtain a level I certification in both LCL and PM for program completion. The ALC
and DLA executive agents must ensure students are placed in an “L” coded position, complete
the DAU training as directed by AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
Management (see courses at http://icatalog.dau.mil), and are performing work in a designated
acquisition organization (such as an acquisition sustainment unit or aircraft sustainment wing) in
order to obtain the level I LCL and PM certifications. If the CBO remains at the ALC or DLA
after program completion, they may work towards level II LCL certification as long as the
position to which they are assigned is an "L" coded position. CBOs must enroll in the
introductory classes during Phase I of the program and plan ahead to ensure all certification
requirements are met. Failure to complete all required courses may impact the officer’s follow-
on assignment and/or completion of the program. NOTE: Due to the AFRC manpower funding
process, AFRC sponsored CBOs remain assigned to their home unit throughout their
 6                                                                   AFI36-2111 4 APRIL 2011


participation in LCBP and will be unable to occupy an “L” coded position. Once the AFRC
CBO completes the program and all DAU educational requirements, they will coordinate with
AF/A4LF for APDP adjudication and conferment of appropriate LCL certification.
     2.2.1. Minimum requirements to obtain level I certification in LCL are occupying an “L”
     coded position within a unit, obtaining one year of acquisition and/or sustainment experience
     in life cycle logistics, and completion of courses as outlined in the current DAU Catalog.
     When occupying an “L” coded position, a CBO must be performing work in a designated
     acquisition organization to receive credit towards their level I certification.
     2.2.2. Minimum requirements to obtain level I certification in PM are occupying an
     acquisition coded position in any functional stall, as well as completing the required Level I
     training. Therefore, while occupying an “L” coded position within a unit as part of the LCBP
     program, CBOs shall be able to obtain the required one-year acquisition experience. Upon
     completion of Level I PM courses, CBOs will be eligible for Level I PM certification. When
     occupying an “L” coded position, CBOs must be performing work in a designated acquisition
     organization to receive credit towards their level I certification in both LCL and PM.
     2.2.3. Minimum requirements to obtain level II certification in LCL include occupying an
     “L” coded position within a unit for a minimum of two years, obtaining two years of
     acquisition and/or sustainment experience in life cycle logistics and completion of courses as
     outlined in the current DAU Catalog. When occupying an “L” coded position, CBOs must
     be performing work in a designated acquisition organization to receive credit towards level II
     certification.

                            ROTATIONAL TRAINING PLANS

3.1. Objectives: Training objectives for LCBP are outlined in the training matrixes, for the
ALCs, AFNWC, and DLA PLFA and are provided in Figure A2.1, Figure A3.1, and Figure A4.1
of this AFI. These objectives will be reviewed annually to ensure accuracy.
3.2. Intent: The intent of the training objectives is to expose CBOs to key logistics concepts
and issues within their LCBP assignment. These training objectives are not confined solely to
one rotation and require continued accomplishment throughout the entire assignment.
3.3. Focus: It is unrealistic to expect a CBO to master these objectives over the course of
several months for each rotation. Instead, each rotation should be used to focus efforts and
attention on key learning objectives. The intent is for CBOs to satisfy the training objectives
first through a combination of methods to include hands-on, training courses, workshops, self-
study, and readings. ALC DCM, AFNWC/CV, DLA PLFA Commanders, and program mentors
play a significant role in mentoring, counseling, and assessing officer development with respect
to the attached objectives. At the end of a CBO’s assignment, he/she should be able to
comfortably discuss the key points associated with each of the objectives outlined in Figure
A2.1., A3.1, and Figure A4.1. of this AFI.

                                  SELECTION PROCEDURES

4.1. Selection: Officers will use their Airman Development Plan (ADP) to communicate their
desire to participate in the LCBP to Developmental Teams (DTs). DTs from the 21X career
fields are responsible for selecting officers to attend LCBP during their fall DT meetings (6XX
officers will use the guidance contained in para. 4.2 below. Air Force Reserve Officers will use
the guidance contained in para. 4.3 below). The following guidance outlines the process for the
21X active duty officer selection for the LCBP.
     4.1.1. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) will notify DTs of the program timeline and
     processes to meet assignment timelines.
     4.1.2. DTs will receive supplemental guidance in a separate message from their responsible
     career field managers outlining individual board processes and program vacancies for the
     following fiscal year.
     4.1.3. AFPC will review candidate eligibility to ensure officers satisfy time-on-station (TOS)
     requirements, meet primary career path goals, and ensure timing of LCBP entry is
     appropriate and applicable for each officer.
     4.1.4. Officers will be notified of their eligibility for the LCBP through an email or AMS
     Robot message from AFPC.
     4.1.5. During fall DT meetings, the teams will make selections to fill program vacancies as
     outlined in Table 4.1.
     4.1.6. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential vacancies.
     4.1.7. Results of the selection process will be published in a consolidated selection message
     NLT 30 days after the last selection board and will identify selected officers and the gaining

4.3. AFRC Selection: The following guidance outlines the process for the selection of Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) officers into the LCBP. Program participation will depend on
AFRC officer availability and AFMC coordination for additional CBO positions for the program.
   4.3.1. AFRC will fund two LCBP positions per year for officers with a primary AFSC of
   21X. These positions are in addition to the active duty positions annotated in Table 4.1 and
   require coordination with AFMC each year to ensure proper placement of potential CBOs.
   4.3.2. 21X officers interested in the LCBP will express their desires in their AFRC Officer
   Development Plan.
   4.3.3. Eligible candidate records will be reviewed scored, and rank ordered by the AFRC
   21X DTs during their fall DT meetings.
   4.3.4. After verification by the CFM, results will be published NLT 30 days after selection.
   The published results will identify selected officers, in addition to projected Report No Later
   Than Dates and gaining units.
   4.3.5. The AFRC 21X DTs will vector LCBP graduates into an appropriate Reserve
   assignment upon completion of LCBP, to include assignment as a Traditional Reservist, Air
   Reserve Technician, or Individual Mobilization Augmentee. AFRC will not normally fund
   follow-on active duty assignments, TDYs, or PCSs upon completion of LCBP, and officers
   should not expect to be vectored into such an assignment.
   4.3.6. Reserve CBOs will be awarded the Special Experience Identifier (SEI) “LLA” upon
   success completion of the LCBP, IAW procedures established in paragraph 8.1 of this AFI.
4.4. Commander’s Involvement: Commanders are encouraged to indicate officers’ desires to
attend LCBP in the ADP and in officer evaluations.
4.5. Allocations: The DTs will select 16/17 (alternating years) officers and assign them based
on the matrix provided below for a total of 33 officers participating in the program at any given
time. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential vacancies.

                       ADDITIONAL DUTIES AND DEPLOYMENTS

7.1. Expectations: Additional duties for officers in the program should be minimal and only be
assigned with the approval of the Program Advisor.
7.2. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Posturing Guidance: Officers in the LCBP
are considered to be in a training status and, as a general rule, unavailable for deployment during
the 2-years of the program. Officers in the LCBP will be assigned Deployment Availability
Code (DAV) 64 in MilPDS for the duration of their assignment to the program. Upon selection
to attend the LCBP, unit commanders will initiate the approval process for a DAV 64 on the
individual prior to the start of the member’s AEF vulnerability period--usually 7-8 months prior
to the start of their postured AEF rotation period--in order to preclude any potential deployment
taskings. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) FAMs must provide specific guidance to respective
AFMC FAMs to ensure this process is managed correctly.

of tomorrow and LCBP graduates will be required to complete a payback assignment following
graduation. Developmental teams/AFPC assignment teams will manage payback assignments
(timing and location) in concert with developmental plans for individual officers.
8.3. Active Duty Service Commitment: Career Broadening Officers incur a 3-year ADSC
upon completion of the program as described in AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
(ADSC). Career Broadening Officers complete the program one of three ways: successful
completion of all training requirements; self-elimination from the program; or removal from the
program for the good of the Air Force. Officers who self-eliminate from the program or are
removed from the program for the good of the Air Force will return to their core AFSC career
field.
