Terms
Air Force Computer Systems Manuals (AFCSM)—Manuals that MAJCOMs, agencies, or the
AFPEO Program Management Office develop that provide specific procedures on how to
operate or maintain a centrally procured automated system used by any functional community,
e.g., Core Automated Maintenance System, Military Personnel Data System, and Reliability and
Maintainability Information System, etc.
AFKAG—A short title used on Air Force general operation publications.              Some of these
publications are handled through CMCS channels.
Air Force Specialized Information Assurance (IA) Publications—The specialized COMSEC
publications and specialized security publications that implement IA policies, directives,
instructions, standards, guidance, manuals, and technical information issued by the CNSS, NIST,
DoD, and NSA.
Authentication element—The authentication element appears on the last page of the publication
before the attachments. It is required to verify approval of the publication; the approval official
applies his/her signature block (not signature) to authenticate the publication. (AFI 33-360)
Cryptographic Operating Instructions and General Publications—A subset of Specialized
COMSEC publications. These operating instructions contain instructions for cryptosystems and
have the short title “AFKAO.” The general publications provide policies and procedures for
COMSEC operations, accounting manual, and controlling and handling special COMSEC
materials, and have the short title “AFKAG.” AFNIC/EVPI and CPSD/HNCDKM produce

CMCS publications apply to organizations operating or maintaining specific cryptologic systems
and have short titles derived from the cryptologic nomenclature system developed by NSA.
Specialized Security Publications—One of the two categories of Air Force Specialized IA
Publications. These publications provide information and implementation instructions for IA
activities.  They include Air Force publications and documents originating from the
implementing CNSS, NIST, NSA, and DoD security requirements and are distributed on the Air
