                   C-5 DEBRIEFING CHECKLIST


                            INTRODUCTION



The Malfunction Analysis and Recording System (MADARS) is installed,
to assist the Flight Engineer and maintenance crew in testing airplane
subsystems for failure. This testing may be performed either in-flight or
on the ground. This debriefing checklist will be used as a guide to assist
the maintenance debriefer in ensuring that all pertinent information on a
system malfunction is included on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
Discrepancy and Work Document to include appropriate MADARS Fault
Codes. This checklist is considered minimal and is not intended to replace
systems knowledge or common sense. The debriefer is charged with the
responsibility of questioning the aircrew to make sure that all symptoms of
a malfunction are known and recorded on the AFTO Form 781A.
Remember this is the only information the technician will have to
determine the source of the problem.
Recommended changes to this checklist will be forwarded through
channels to HQ AMC/A4M.
I. Instructions: Prior to debriefing:
   A. The debriefing team members will review past debriefing forms,
      logs, or files to acquaint themselves with any previous repeat/
      recurring discrepancies.
   B. The appropriate maintenance specialty should be represented at the
      debriefing to help clarify discrepancies.
II. Debriefing Procedures:
   A. The debriefing team leader will take charge of the debriefing and
      debrief the aircrew, utilizing this checklist as a guide.
   B. Make special note of repeated or recurring discrepancies. Review
      all AFTO Forms 781A for the mission(s).
   C. Ensure ALL in-flight shutdowns are reported and documented
      IAW Sec III, item 4b of this checklist. All questions MUST be
      answered and the results entered on AMC Form 97 and in G081,
      screen 9023.
   D. Using the questions in this checklist, ensure that all open
      discrepancies are described as completely as possible.
   E. Crosscheck previous discrepancies using Ground Processing
      System (GPS) Product 67-89-01 (Repeat Discrepancies for
      Aircraft) or previous three flight histories against current mission
      for repeat or recurring discrepancies.
   F. Determine if aircraft was flown low level over salt water and act as
      necessary to comply with T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapon System
      Cleaning and Corrosion Control.
   G. Ensure ALL locations where the aircraft stopped and chemically
      disinfected for Foot and Mouth Disease, an entry is made in the
      781A’s. Debriefers will document this information in GO81 using
      screen 9051, with work unit code 02400 to create the Foot and
      Mouth Decontamination discrepancy; G081 will automatically
      enter this information in the aircraft history. Report this
      information to HQ AMC/A4MJS; DSN 779-2622 / Commercial
      618-229-2622. Accurate tracking is essential. Potentially
      damaging long-term effects of decontamination on sensitive
      aircraft parts may occur.
   H. Determine if aircraft was flown through predicted areas of low
      volcanic ash, an entry is made in the 781A’s. Debriefers will
      document this information in GO81 using screen XXXX, with
      work unit code XXXX to create the volcanic ash discrepancy;
      G081 will automatically enter this information in the aircraft
      history.
