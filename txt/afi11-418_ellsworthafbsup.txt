          2.2.2. All Operations Supervisors (Ops Sup/Top 3) candidates will be SOF qualified
          prior to being Ops Sup/Top 3 qualified.
          2.2.3. Ops Sup/Top 3 candidates will use the Operations Supervision Nomination and
          Training Record (Attachment 5) to document training. Completed documentation will be
          placed in the individuals training folder, maintained by the squadron training office.
      2.4. (Added) Weekly SOF / Ops Sup/Top 3 / Duty IP Schedule. Unit supervisors and
      schedulers are responsible for scheduling and annotating unit flying supervision. The most
      up-to-date weekly schedule is available online, via electronic Patriot Excalibur (ePEX), no
      later than (NLT) close of business the Friday before the week starts. Schedulers will ensure
      individuals are current and qualified prior to scheduling them for SOF duties. If ePEX is
      down, schedulers will post the most current schedule by alternate means.
           2.4.1. (Added) Non-current SOFs will immediately notify the duty scheduler and
           Squadron Director of Operations if scheduled for SOF duties and unable to regain
           currency prior to the scheduled SOF tour.

Table 2. (Added) 28th Bomb Wing Minimum Flying Unit Supervision Requirements.
 Types of Operations              SOF Location                    Ops Sup/Top 3 Location
 Daily Flying Ops                 Duty Location (1)               Available (3)
 Reduced Flying Ops (5)           Duty Location (1, 5)            Available (3)
 Off Station Sorties              N/R                             Available (3)
 Deployed Ops                     Duty Location (2)               Available (2)
 Cross Country Dept/Rtn           Duty Location (1,4)             Available (3)
 Note 1: Duty locations are in the Air Traffic Control Tower (primary) or the SOF vehicle
 (alternate).
 Note 2: For deployed operations, the deployed unit commander will coordinate with the host
 base Operations Group Commander for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating
 into the host base SOF and/or Ops Sup/Top 3 program. For locations with no existing SOF
 program, deployed unit commanders are responsible for ensuring adequate operations
 supervision during all flying activities.
 Note 3: Ops Sup/Top 3’s must be immediately available by telephone or Land Mobile Radio
 (LMR). Ops Sup/Top 3’s will carry an LMR and monitor “OG” and “UHF Pri” at all times
 while performing Ops Sup/Top 3 duties on base. Ops Sup/Top 3 may adjourn to quarters outside
 of normal duty hours after all aircraft have launched.
 Note 4: For aircraft departing from EAFB, the SOF will be on duty until 45 minutes after the
 last aircraft departs. For aircraft returning to EAFB, the SOF will be back on duty from one hour
 prior to aircraft arrival until engine shutdown of the last arriving aircraft.
 Note 5: Reduced flying operations are any period with one squadron flying no more than two
 sorties. 28 OG/CC may waive an excess of this number. During reduced flying operations the
 SOF and Ops Sup/Top 3 duties may be accomplished by a single Ops Sup/Top 3 qualified and
 SOF current aircrew referred to as “FOX-3”. FOX-3 will have the SOF vehicle available to
 assume SOF duties.

  2.5. (Added) Shift Changeover. Daily SOF shift changeover will be annotated on the flying
  schedule. Different changeover times may be coordinated as long as crew rest and duty day
  requirements are met. Changeover times will be de-conflicted from scheduled takeoffs and
  landings to prevent distractions in the event of an emergency.
4. Responsibilities.
  4.3. SOF will:
       4.3.1.1. (Added) SOFs must be current in SOF duties, Flight Crew Information Files
       (FCIF), and SOF Read Files prior to performing duties. SOF currency/recurrency
       requirements are listed in para 13. FCIFs may be reviewed at unit step desks or online
       via ePEX, under “FCIF”. In addition, Duty not Involving Flying (DNIF) SOFs must
       meet criteria listed in para 6.5.3.1.
       4.3.1.2. (Added) Time permitting, the opening SOF should attend the first step brief of
       the day. If time does not permit step brief attendance, the SOF is responsible for
       obtaining copies of the most current schedule including aircraft and crew lineup, review
       any new FCIFs, Mission Execution Forecast, Alternate/Divert Weather Forecasts,
4                                          AFI11-418_ELLSWORTHAFBSUP 22 APRIL 2014




         Temporary Flight Restrictions, and Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) via other means, such
         as the SOF computer, Base Operations, phone, or fax.
                   4.3.1.2.1. (Added) If the SOF leaves the tower during flying outside of the
                   local area, the SOF will provide contact information (e.g., the SOF cell phone
                   number) to the Tower Supervisor and the command post, in the event of an
                   early Return to Base (RTB) or emergency. Notify the 28 OG/CC as soon as
                   possible after relocating if SOF duties will be from the SOF vehicle.
         4.3.1.3. (Added) The SOF will contact Ops Sup/TOP-3 or squadron ops (with guidance
         to relay the information to the Ops Sup/Top-3) to discuss airfield issues, aircraft status,
         crew and/or tail swaps, and any possible deviations to the flying schedule; such as
         changes in times, fuel loads, weapons, and/or airspace.
         4.3.1.4. (Added) The closing SOF will ensure aircraft land NLT 0030L. If the scheduled
         land time is after 0030L, aircraft will not overfly unless previously coordinated and
         approved by the OG/CC. SOFs will direct crews to RTB and/or full stop to prevent
         Radar Approach Control/Tower personnel from exceeding their maximum duty day limit
         and to meet follow-on crew rest requirements.
         4.3.1.5. (Added) The SOF will complete all applicable items of the Opening, Closing, or
         Changeover checklists located in the Quick Reaction Checklist (QRC).
    4.3.5.
         4.3.5.1. (Added) The SOF has the authority to delay departure or direct a go-around if
         an improper aircraft configuration is observed. The SOF will advise crews of any
         observed abnormal indications such as sparks, excessive smoke, fire, loose panels, etc.
         The SOF may use GUARD if time is critical. If safety and time permit, the SOF should
         coordinate with Tower Watch Supervisor to use the appropriate Approach, Tower, or
         Ground Controller to direct aircraft to hold position, go around, or low approach, as
         necessary for safe operations.
    4.3.7.
         4.3.7.1. (Added) The SOF will ensure all local and transient aircraft are notified of
         runway closures as soon as possible. The SOF will determine the estimated duration of
         closure and advise crews to hold or divert, as necessary. If aircraft are beyond UHF
         contact range, the SOF will attempt to relay information using applicable agencies
         (Denver Center, Clover Control, Smokey Range Control Officer, etc.).
         4.3.7.2. (Added) During local flight operations, the SOF will coordinate with the 28th
         Operations Support Squadron Weather Shop and review NOTAMs to determine primary
         and secondary divert/alternate airfields. The SOF will check divert/alternate airfield
         suitability within 1 hour of planned departure and arrival windows. If a primary
         divert/alternate becomes unsuitable, the SOF will notify crews and units Ops Sup/Top 3
         of the new primary and secondary alternate/divert airfields.
    4.3.8.
         4.3.8.1. (Added) If freezing precipitation (snow, sleet, flurries, etc.) is forecast for the
         following day, a snow removal meeting will be convened immediately after the wing
         production meeting. The next day’s Morning Supervisor of Flying (AM SOF), or a
AFI11-418_ELLSWORTHSUP 22 APRIL 2014                                                             5




      designated SOF representative will attend the snow removal meeting. If freezing
      precipitation is forecast for the first fly-day after a weekend and/or holiday, this meeting
      will occur on the last duty day prior to the weekend and/or holiday.
              4.3.8.1.1. (Added) If the SOF (or representative) is unable to attend the snow
              removal meeting, the SOF, as a minimum, will review the snow removal plan
              with the 28th Operations Support Squadron Airfield Manager. In either case the
              SOF will fill out the Snow Removal Plan Sheet (Attachment 6) electronically in
              the SOF folder on the 28th Operations Group (28 OG) shared drive, and leave a
              hard copy on the clipboard for the opening SOF to review.
      4.3.8.2. (Added) Prior to the first launch of the day, the SOF will check the status of the
      runway and taxiways to determine if additional snow removal is required. The SOF
      should also visually check the aircraft to determine the status of deicing or if additional
      deicing is required and report the status to squadron Ops Sup/Top 3.

      4.3.8.3. (Added) The SOF will coordinate safe, efficient, and prioritized snow removal
      with Airfield Management. Ops Sup/Top 3 will coordinate de-icing procedures with the
      28th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. Airfield Management may be contacted by phone
      at 385-1052, LMR, or via UHF radio (Dispatch, 372.2 MHz). The SOF will not contact
      snow removal contractors directly, except in an emergency.
              4.3.8.3.1. (Added) SOFs will monitor current runway condition reading (RCR)
              for all usable airfield surfaces and provide the readings to squadron ops desks for
              aircrew planning.
  4.3.10.
      4.3.10.1. (Added) The SOF will use the electronic SOF Log (depicted in Attachment 3)
      to track major events during flying operations and to document any unusual situations, In
      Flight Emergencies (IFE), diverts, or intervention. The SOF Daily Log can be accessed
      by mapping the “SOF” folder from the 28 OG shared drive. AM SOF and Night
      Supervisor of Flying (PM SOFs) are responsible for keeping the Daily Log current and
      saving the file often to keep the most up-to-date info available. 28 OG/OGV will
      maintain an archive for a minimum of 1 year.
      4.3.10.2. (Added) A paper SOF log, located in the SOF binder located with SOF’s
      publications, will be used as a back-up. 28 OG/OGV will maintain archive copies for a
      minimum of 1 year.
4.4. Ops Sup/Top 3 will:
  4.4.4.
      4.4.4.1. (Added) The Duty IP will be available for technical assistance and will leave
      contact/cell phone info with the Ops Sup/Top 3 and SOF if unavailable at the squadron.
      Duty IPs will have access to applicable Technical Orders. If required, the duty IP will go
      to the tower or step desk to facilitate assistance to the SOF/aircrew.
  4.4.5.
      4.4.5.1.
6                                            AFI11-418_ELLSWORTHAFBSUP 22 APRIL 2014




                    4.4.5.1.1. (Added) TOP-3 or SOF will advise the OG/CC, or designated
                    representative, of real-time scheduling changes to aircrew, line number/call-sign,
                    tail number, or takeoff/land times. TOP-3 will also ensure the SOF is advised of
                    all scheduling changes coordinated with the OG/CC.
    4.4.8.
           4.4.8.1. (Added) The Ops Sup/Top 3 will prepare the electronic SOF Log (depicted in
           Attachment 3) in the event a SOF is not required (see Table 2.)
5. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
    5.1.
           5.1.1.
                5.1.1.1. (Added) The SOF will use all available resources to aid in the safe
                recovery of an emergency aircraft including appropriate technical orders, the
                Inflight Guide, QRC, and the 28th Bomb Wing Supervisor of Flying Emergency
                Procedure Guide. The SOF may also obtain technical assistance from appropriate
                Ops Sup/Top 3 and/or the Duty IP.
           5.1.2.
                5.1.2.1. (Added) Time permitting, during an IFE, the SOF will inform the 28
                OG/CC and TOP-3 of the call-sign, nature of the emergency, landing runway, and
                impact to local flying ops.
           5.1.3.
                5.1.3.1. (Added) The SOF will consider aircraft distance from the airfield or
                Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) and fuel remaining in order to determine landing
                priority. If an emergency aircraft is holding to burn down gas prior to landing, the
                SOF should direct other aircraft to land first, prior to the emergency aircraft’s ETA
                to prevent diverts. When the emergency aircraft is ready to exit holding to land,
                that aircraft will now have priority, and other aircraft will be directed to hold until
                the IFE is terminated.
                5.1.3.2. (Added) Runway operations will be suspended until the IFE is terminated
                by the 28th Civil Engineer Squadron Fire Chief or Assistant Fire Chief. Unless
                waived by the SOF, the runway will remain closed until Airfield Management has
                inspected and cleared the runway of possible Foreign Object Damage. SOFs will
                update airborne aircraft with airfield status so they can plan diverts, if required.
                5.1.3.3. (Added) If an IFE occurs during SOF changeover, then the SOF on duty at
                the start of the IFE will remain on duty through the termination of the IFE, or until
                receiving 28 OG/CC approval to changeover. The oncoming SOF may remain to
                assist the on-duty SOF until IFE termination. If the 28 OG/CC approves a
                changeover, the outgoing SOF will remain until the oncoming SOF is thoroughly
                familiar with the emergency and demonstrates the ability to provide supervision.
6. SOF Guidance.
    6.2. Duty Hours:
AFI11-418_ELLSWORTHSUP 22 APRIL 2014                                                             7

16. BIRD AND WILDLIFE HAZARDS

Foxtrot must monitor the local area for bird and wildlife hazards. Use available means during limited visibility and night operations to
evaluate the bird status including safety and airfield management personnel to conduct airfield sweeps, include the golf course and
holding ponds around the runway.
BIRDS
a.      ADVISE AIRCREW IN                     • Coord with Tower Watch Sup – Tower is trained to advise aircrew
        PATTERN                               • Use 311.0 as a backup
b.      NOTIFY AM OPS/ SAFETY                 • Instruct AM ops to clear runway environment
        OF WILDLIFE ACTIVITY

c.      CHANGE BIRD                          •    Coord with Tower and AM ops to change bird watch condition (BWC).
        CONDITION                                      o (Ref 28 BW BWASH Plan, 1 Sep 09)
                                             •    BWC - SEVERE. Heavy concentration of birds on or immediately above the active
                                                  runway or other specific locations representing an immediate hazard to safe flying
                                                  operations. Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before
                                                  conducting operations in areas under Condition SEVERE. For example: 20-40 small
                                                  starling size birds congregating on approach may warrant Condition SEVERE. A
                                                  smaller (4-10) group of duck or goose size birds may also constitute Condition
                                                  SEVERE.
                                                                 NO takeoffs/landings/approaches without OG approval

                                             •    BWC - MODERATE. Concentrations of birds observable in locations that represent a
                                                  probable hazard to safe flying operations. This condition requires increased vigilance
                                                  by all agencies and supervisors and caution by aircrews. For example: 10-30 small
                                                  birds on the airfield environment, but not near the runway or approach/departure
                                                  paths may constitute Condition MODERATE. Similarly, one or two hawk-size birds or
                                                  other predators flying near runway may constitute Bird Watch Condition MODERATE.

                                                                  If bird activity is not in arrival corridor, then one approach to a full

20.     GLOBAL HAWK EMERGENCY DIVERT PROCEDURES

EAFB is an emergency landing site for GLOBAL HAWK transient flights and could be used in event of an emergency divert The
decision to use Ellsworth AFB will be followed by a call to the TOWER from the GLOBAL HAWK crew (base ops and CP may not be
notified). Tower and/or RAPCON may be the first to know a GLOBAL HAWK is arriving when it shows on RADAR.
     a. OBTAIN IFE DIVERT DATA              • Determine ETA
                                            • Active Runway
                                            • Departures and arrivals +/- 30 min of Global Hawk ETA
                                            • Planned Recovery
                                            • Post Flight Plan (Coordinate with the GH crew)
     b. ADVISE TWR WATCH SUP                • Inform tower watch sup of the impacted local flying

      c. REVIEW GH DIVERT               •   Reference the SOF read file
         GUIDANCE
      d. NOTIFY OG/CC                   •   Contact OG/CC and Top3 (when able) and pass arrival data and recovery plan
                                            (above).

      e. EMERGENCY RESPONSE             •   Confirm tower started the crash net
         UNITS NOTIFIED                 •   Fire department and crash response teams in place

      f. NOTIFY LOCAL AIRCRAFT          •   Ensure local aircraft are aware of impending runway operations suspension
                                        •   Launch or recover aircraft as appropriate
                                                o Local pattern work should be terminated and the AC directed to land or
                                                     leave the local area.
                                        •   De-conflict the pattern – do not hold aircraft at the IAF of either runway, the GH may
                                            use this area as a descent area (recommend PRT). Ensure tower and RAPCON are
                                            aware of this potential.
      g. RECOVER OTHER                  •   Determine the need to recover other aircraft (try to get the other aircraft on the deck
         AIRCRAFT (as required)             NLT 30 min prior to GH ETA). This may not be possible due to the nature of the EP –
                                            coordinate with the GH crew to allow a manned aircraft EP to land first.
                                        •   Consider:
                                                o Fuel state
                                                o Weather
                                                o Nature of emergency
                                                o Other emergency aircraft inbound or holding
                                                o Expected runway operations suspension

      h. MONITOR THE EP                 •   If the engine is running, a radiation hazard exists and personnel should not be near
         GROUND OPS                         the aircraft. Emergency responders have the applicable procedures and precautions
                                            to follow.
                                        •   The aircraft will have to be towed, ensure Air Field Management (not MX) is
                                            coordinating for the tow.
      i. IF THE GH                      •   Run the Aircraft Crash QRC section 19 of this document.
         CRASHES/DEPARTS THE            •   Notify OG/CC and Top 3 immediately
         RUNWAY                         •   Begin preparations for diverts if aircraft are airborne
      j. EXECUTE A FOD SWEEP            •   Ensure the runway is ready to resume operations ASAP.
      k. NOTIFY OG/CC OF IFE            •   Notify OG/CC, Top-3, and CP of IFE termination.

BIRD    WATCH
CONDITION

  Use Bird Watch Condition Codes for rapid communications to disseminate bird activity information and implement unit
  operational procedures. Bird locations should be given along with the condition code.

Condition SEVERE: Heavy concentration of birds on or immediately above the active runway or other specific locations that represent an
immediate hazard to safe flying operations. 20-40 small starling size birds congregating on approach may warrant Condition SEVERE. A smaller
(4-10) group of duck or geese may also be Condition SEVERE. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE. Concentrations of birds observable in
locations which represent a probable hazard to safe flying operations. 10-30 small birds on the airfield environment, but not near the runway or
approach/departure paths may constitute Condition MODERATE. Similarly, one or two predator (hawk) size birds flying near the runway may
constitute Condition MODERATE.
Bird Watch Condition SEVERE
When bird activity on or near the airfield is SEVERE: Do not take off during Bird Watch Condition SEVERE without 28 OG/CC approval. If the
location and numbers of birds will allow a safe takeoff using special precautions (such as taking off from a different runway), Foxtrot will obtain
permission from the 28 OG/CC for the aircrew to takeoff. Do not land except for emergency aircraft or if required by fuel to full stop (28
OG/CC approval also required).
Bird Watch Condition MODERATE
No formation wing takeoffs or wing landings. All missions will terminate with only one approach to a full stop. Takeoffs and multiple
approaches will be allowed only with OG/CC approval. Pilots will be particularly cognizant of bird activity when on final approach and will
initiate a go-around immediately if a bird strike is imminent.
Bird Watch Condition LOW.
Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of hazard.
Changing the Current Bird Watch Condition Code. At Ellsworth AFB, the primary initiator for upgrading or downgrading a Bird Watch
Condition code lies with Foxtrot. When the SOF is not available or judgment dictates, The Airfield Manager, the Airfield Operations Flight
Commander, or the control tower may recommend a change in the Bird Watch Condition code. In all cases recommendations will be
forwarded to Base Operations. Base Operations in turn notifies the 28 OG/CC. All changes in the Bird Watch Condition codes are subject to
28 OG/CC approval.

** NOTE: Since no White Tail Deer have ever been reported on the EAFB flightline, if you’re
not sure what kind of deer you saw, a good guess would be a Mule Deer.
If deer or other wildlife pose an immediate threat to airborne aircraft, contact the Tower (385-
6245) immediately!!!

Otherwise, contact Airfield Management (385-1052) or Wing Flight Safety (385-2599) to herd
the wildlife off the Airfield.
