SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It updates wing
policies and procedures to respond to, direct and execute time-sensitive peacetime and wartime
operations through the use of the 21 SW/CC and contingency staffs. These operations are
necessary to support war plans or periods of increased readiness, or respond to major accidents
or disaster situations. This instruction changes the 21 SW Crisis Action Team’s composition,
roles and responsibilities.
1. General. When formed, the 21 SW Crisis Action Team (CAT) provides the ability to plan,
direct, coordinate, and exercise command and control (C2) of wing forces across the spectrum of
conflict. This includes monitoring on-going execution of operational tasking received from
 2                                                                     21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011


higher headquarters. The CAT is located in the 21 SW Peterson Installation Control Center
(PICC). The PICC is the wing-level C2 facility for response to wartime and peacetime crisis
situations. CAT members will:
     1.1. Activate their functional area staff when required.
     1.2. Coordinate and track actions for which they are designated OPR, including coordination
     with OCRs and appropriate activities within the 21 SW and external military and civil
     agencies.
     1.3. Prepare message traffic implementing actions for which they are designated OPR.
     1.4. Assist the CAT Director in preparing briefings.
     1.5. Ensure Readiness Condition (LERTCON), Force Protection (FPCON), and Information
     Condition (INFOCON) actions are completed.
     1.6. Provide Situation Report (SITREP) inputs at designated times.
     1.7. Provide the appropriate expertise to plan, direct and execute C2.
     1.8. Report directly to the primary or alternate facility when notified of a recall. These
     personnel will call their unit for accountability.
     1.9. Provide advice and guidance to 21 SW leadership with respect to crisis situations across
     the spectrum of conflict.
2. CAT Organization and Functions.
     2.1. The CAT is organized to respond to the commander’s needs which could range from a
     fully formed staff or from select members required for a limited situation. The staff is
     convened or placed on alert as directed by the commander or designated alternate. The staff
     maintains the ability to conduct 24-hour operations and normally consists of two teams, ―A‖
     and ―B‖ teams, see Attachment 2, Crisis Action Team Personnel Requirements Matrix.
     Members may be added or omitted due to changing requirements. The commander can
     assess a limited situation and direct a full activation or a smaller staff consisting of specific
     members to respond to the situation. Conversely, manning can also be reduced to manage a
     situation not requiring the entire staff. The command cell determines CAT composition. The
     CAT is normally composed of the command cell and special advisory staff. In addition there
     are CAT associate positions that provide specific expertise as required.
     2.2. Command Cell: The Command Cell is composed of the Commander, Vice
     Commander, Operations Group Commander, Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander,
     Medical Group Commander, 721st Mission Support Group Commander and the 821st Air
     Base Group Commander. The 721 MSG Commander normally resides at the Emergency
     Operations Center in Cheyenne Mountain. The 721 MSG Commander or designated
     representative may be required to report to the Peterson CAT for support. If the CAT is
     activated, the 721 MSG Commander or designated representative and the 821 ABG
     Commander must be in contact with the 21 SW CAT at all times unless directed otherwise.
     The 302d Air Wing Commander may be asked to attend based on the incident. The
     Command Cell executes overall command and ensures the wing’s mission, support functions,
     and survivability continues to the maximum extent possible.

   2.3. Special Advisory Staff (SAS). The CAT is supported by a SAS. The SAS are full-time
   trained CAT members tasked to provide functional area expertise. The SAS will normally
   consist of experienced representatives from the Anti Terrorism Office (ATO), Staff Judge
   Advocate, Safety, Public Affairs, 721 MSG, each Group Liaison Officer (LNO), SFS LNO,
   Entry Controllers, Computer System Administrator’s, Hot Back-Up team, Director, Deputy
   Director and the PICC LNO. The commander may adjust the SAS according to incident
   needs.
   2.4. CAT Associate Positions.
      2.4.1. Associates are not sitting members of the CAT, but are available to provide
      necessary briefings or updates. Otherwise, they operate out of their respective work
      areas. Base mission partners may be Associates for base emergencies affecting their
      operations. The commander may add or omit associate members as required. The
      following organizations are full-time CAT Associates:
      2.4.2. The Intelligence Flight (21 OSS/IN) provides intelligence updates and potential
      threats.
      2.4.3. The Weather Flight (21 OSS/OSW) provides weather updates for 21 SW Area of
      Responsibility.

          4.1.18.15. Prepare briefings. Normal 21 SW briefings are the IMMEDIATE,
          QUICK LOOK and READINESS BRIEFINGS.
      4.1.19. The CAT Entry Controller (EC) will:
          4.1.19.1. Report directly to the CAT upon direction to activate.
          4.1.19.2. Provide entry control to the PICC and CAT facility.
      4.1.20. The CAT Hot Back Up Team will:
          4.1.20.1. Report directly to the CAT location upon direction to activate.
          4.1.20.2. Receive appropriate briefings and then report to the alternate location using
          the Hot Back Up checklist.
          4.1.20.3. Stand-up and secure the alternate facility by opening the safes, ensuring the
          computers are operational and ensuring the unclassified/classified phones and a/v
          equipment are operational.
          4.1.20.4. Maintain situational awareness by calling primary CAT to receive current
          status updates of events and inputs.
5. CAT Activation.
   5.1. The 21 SW/CC will decide and direct a recall through the 21 SW/CP for a CAT
   activation in response to a contingency. The 21 SW/CC or 21 OG/CC may activate the
   Space Control Team (SCT) for a classified contingency involving space control units. Each
   organization supporting the CAT will develop internal procedures to recall CAT members
   within their organizations IAW this instruction and 21 SWI10-218. Crisis Action Team
   members will report immediately and safely to the designated location. The goal is to report
   within one hour of recall, unless notified otherwise. Depending on the situation, the 21
   SW/CC may activate both teams, only one team, or only a select few.
   5.2. When the 21 SW/CC has directed an activation, the 21 SW/CP will contact 21 SW
   group commanders, the Director of Staff and the CAT Directors. The commanders will
   initiate telephonic recall of CAT members using procedures noted in Paragraph 5.1
   5.3. Alternate team members will report for duty if primary representatives are not available.
   Crisis Action Team POCs must know the status of all respective group CAT members. The
   commander must have the capability of requesting support/advice from any team member for
   any type of contingency. Therefore it is imperative that members notify their alternates of
   non availability. Members must be prepared to report to the primary, alternate or tertiary
   locations.
   5.4. Primary and alternate members must inform the respective group POC when they
   become unavailable for CAT duties.
   5.5. When the command cell approves the battle rhythm and shift schedule, the relief team
   normally will be released into a rest period (if initially recalled). If necessary, relief team
 10                                                                21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011


   members will be used as substitutes for their opposite team counterparts if the primary is
   unavailable.
   5.6. The 21 SW/CC will declare the CAT activated when it is formed, updated, and assumes
   responsibility for the situation. At times the 21 SW/CC deems a complete team is not
   necessary, the staff can be considered activated if only one person is required. If not
   previously directed, the 21 SW/CC or 21 OG/CC will determine the requirement for
   operations squadrons to form the UCC’s.
   5.7. If required, the 21 SW/CP will immediately notify HQ AFSPC Command Center, 14
   AF Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) and GSUs of CAT activation time and reason.
   The 21 SW/CP will also advise the same addressees of deactivation.
6. CAT Information Flow and Communications.
   6.1. Information Flow.
      6.1.1. The CAT will coordinate its actions closely with the PICC through the CP Liaison.
      The 21 SW/CP is the focal point for up-channeling information to HHQ and must track
      events in parallel to the CAT to determine OPREP-3 requirements.
      6.1.2. All significant events and taskings received are initially documented on a 21 SW
      Form 37.
      6.1.3. The 21 SW Form 37 will be prepared with a minimum of three copies (original
      plus two copies) for the director, fusion cell and the PICC. All times are annotated in
      Universal (Zulu) Time. The fusion cell will ensure any required information is entered
      into the status briefing and the events log and other locations as necessary. If using the
      electronically devised 21 SW Form 37, the fusion cell will ensure all members are in
      receipt.
      6.1.4. Personnel will complete the form 21 SW Form 37 with as much detail as possible
      about the event or tasking being documented. All pertinent blocks will be completed and
      the appropriate security classification (Unclassified, Confidential or Secret), shall be
      annotated at the top and bottom. As a minimum, the form will be marked ―For Official
      Use Only.‖ A significant event is an event that will affect or has affected the status or
      capability of a 21 SW unit, and must be acted upon.
      6.1.5. The form is then provided immediately to the deputy director. The deputy ensures
      the form is legible and classification markings are annotated. The form is then provided
      to the director. The director determines whether the command cell needs to be notified of
      the event or tasking. The form is then provided to the fusion cell. The fusion cell ensures
      all required copies are accomplished and provided to the appropriate personnel. The
      fusion cell will then issue a form number, log the information and update any required
      status displays.
      6.1.6. Checklists. If the director determines the need to notify the command cell, the
      director will obtain CAT members attention and brief the input leading the command cell
      and SAS personnel through the appropriate checklist. If using an electronic version, the
      fusion cell will display the checklist using available projectors and accomplish the
      checklist with the team. Members may use the unclassified hard copy checklists for note
      taking, etc.
21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011                                                                      11


        6.1.6.1. The use of checklists, whether electronic or hard copy in response to events
        or incidents are mandatory. These checklists provide a list of general actions
        necessary to gather information, assess impacts, develop courses of action, and
        respond to or recover from a given situation. Checklists are developed from approved
        functional and operations plans, instructions, or other directives. Checklists are only
        a means to guide the staff through logical situations. The team must realize all
        situations cannot be directed by a checklist. If more information is needed, the
        Director, upon commander approval, may pause in the checklist, have the appropriate
        OPRs obtain more information and come back to the checklist at a specified time.
        Or, rather than keeping the checklist open, the Director may assign the open checklist
        action to the OPR and close the checklist. The fusion cell must identify the open
        action item, the OPR and the suspense time.
            6.1.6.1.1. Checklists are designed for use by CAT members but other units may
            use them for information purposes and as a means to devise their unit specific
            checklists.
            6.1.6.1.2. Online collaboration is a key element of CAT information flow and
            communication with the EOC and UCCs. CAT members are trained in the use of
            the Defense Connect Online (DCO) tool. Units must practice communications
            security always when using unclassified chat rooms. Telephonic communication
            is a means if chat rooms are unavailable. CAT personnel normally use the NIPR
            or SIPR for status briefings, log preparations and to provide the commanders
            common operating pictures. However these networks systems cannot be relied
            upon as the only source of communication. Hard copy checklists and telephone
            may be the only choice when there is a communications loss. If telephonic
            communications are unavailable, runners will be dispatched to the CAT facility
            for staff directive actions.
     6.1.7. CAT Directives. The FC will use directives to notify 21 SW GCCs/UCCs of
     incidents. Directives provide a fast and efficient means of notifying all 21 SW units of
     any given situation. The directive will not be submitted without commander approval.
     Members will continually update their appropriate personnel organizations on event
     status, open action items, or delays in implementing contingency actions. Normally the
     CAT Directive is unclassified but may be classified based on the situation. If the CAT
     directive is classified and the GCC/UCC does not have access to a classified terminal, the
     GCC/UCC will be notified by secure means or will have procedures in place to provide a
     runner to pick up the directive. This process will also be implemented as a backup to a
     communications loss.
     6.1.8. Directives must identify unit/installation applicability/non-applicability. As an
     example, a directive implementing FPCON change due to a local threat analysis may not
     apply to the 821 ABG or Cheyenne Mountain AFS however these installations should be
     notified of any 21 SW actions.
  6.2. Communications Requirements: The following minimum communications will be
  maintained at both the primary and alternate Crisis Action Team locations:
     6.2.1. Administrative and secure telephones, secure and non-secure computers and
     access to land-mobile radios capable of monitoring all base emergency radio nets.
 12                                                                     21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011


      6.2.2. Projection capability to conduct briefings, display status, or monitor contingency
      actions.
      6.2.3. A secure computer network with access to the Secure Internet Protocol Routing
      Network (SIPRNET).
7. Training Requirements.
   7.1. The 21 SW CAT manager is responsible for establishing and conducting general CAT
   member training. The manager will ensure representatives are trained on the procedural
   operations of the CAT, to include organization, member responsibilities, and overview of
   facilities.
   7.2. The 21 SW CAT manager may provide training assistance for unit contingency staffs
   regarding their command and control CAT relationships.
   7.3. General training of 21 SW CAT members will consist of two areas: initial and recurring
   training.
      7.3.1. Initial Training (IT) consists of an orientation to CAT operations and must be
      completed prior to performing duty as a CAT member. IT training items cover, at a
      minimum:
          7.3.1.1. Composition of CATduties/functional responsibilities of its members.
          7.3.1.2. Physical configuration, entry control and physical security of facilities.
          7.3.1.3. Communication systems and information flow.
          7.3.1.4. Operations and communications security vulnerabilities and procedures.
          7.3.1.5. Significant event and checklist processing.
          7.3.1.6. FPCON, INFOCON and LERTCON changes and attainment.
          7.3.1.7. Evacuation and relocation to alternate facilities.
          7.3.1.8. Briefing and report requirements and construction.
          7.3.1.9. OPLAN Taskings.
          7.3.1.10. SITREP reporting procedures.
          7.3.1.11. Maps.    All personnel should be familiar with the standard GEOBASE
          format.
          7.3.1.12. Checklist Markings. To aid in situation awareness and crew position
          changeovers, it is recommended that CAT members use and understand the following
          standard markings:
             7.3.1.12.1. A ‖C‖ indicates the step was accomplished. A check mark may be
             used in lieu of the ―C‖ if using hard copy checklists.
             7.3.1.12.2. An ―O‖ indicates the step was noted or initiated open but not
             completed. All steps must be accomplished before the checklist is considered
             complete.
             7.3.1.12.3. An ―N‖ indicates the step is not applicable/not required.
21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011                                                                         13


              7.3.1.12.4. A ―P‖ indicates a checklist step was previously accomplished.
              7.3.1.12.5. An ―S‖ indicates that the checklist step is to be simulated.
                  7.3.1.12.5.1. Members should not proceed from one step to the next without
                  appropriately marking each step.
       7.4.1. Recurring Training (RT) is conducted for CAT members and focuses on new
       procedures, lessons learned from exercises or real-world events, and reviews of current
       procedures. Participation in wing exercises can also satisfy recurring training needs if
       they cover any of the objectives in paragraphs 7.4.1.1. thru 7.4.1.5.
           7.4.1.1. FPCON, INFOCON, or LERTCON changes.
           7.4.1.2. Major Accident Response.
           7.4.1.3. Natural Disaster Response.
           7.4.1.4. CAT evacuation and relocation.
           7.4.1.5. CAT checklists.
       7.4.2. Associate Training.
           7.4.2.1. Associates are not required to attend training.
       7.4.3. Documentation.
           7.4.3.1. Document CAT or unit-level training on appropriate standard training forms
           or computer-based programs. Retain documentation for one year or when the
           individual is no longer performing CAT duties.
8. Operations Security (OPSEC).
   8.1. Crisis Action Team members will:
       8.1.1. Follow strict OPSEC procedures at all times. It is the responsibility of all
       personnel to properly safeguard sensitive and classified material and dispose of such
       information when no longer needed. Personnel must be aware of the adversarial threat to
       21 SW systems, mission, and personnel.
       8.1.2. Practice the ―need-to-know‖ principle when discussing sensitive unclassified
       information over non-secure lines.
       8.1.3. Reduce indicators that could reveal the nature of operations.
       8.1.4. Use door locks, sound masking, and red lights to provide security for and
       awareness of classified briefings or group discussions taking place inside the facility. If
       equipped, use the push to talk handsets.
9. Communications Security (COMSEC).
   9.1. CAT members will:
       9.1.1. Never discuss or talk around classified information on any unsecure telephone.
9.1.2. Ensure all two-way communication devices are secured in the main facility corridor of the
PICC prior to entering any areas or the PICC crew floor.
 14                                                                  21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011


       9.1.3. State to all in the vicinity ―Open Line‖ if making or answering a non-secure call,
       to prevent an OPSEC/COMSEC violation. Once the non-secure call is complete, advise
       all in the vicinity of a ―Closed Line.‖ Personnel will not open a non-secure line when a
       secure call or discussion is in progress.
       9.1.4. Inform all personnel ―Secure Up‖ when making a secure call. Members with a
       non-secure line open should end their discussion immediately to prevent an
       OPSEC/COMSEC violation. Advise all ―Secure Down‖ once the secure call is complete.
       Members are clear to open a non-secure line when the secure line is down.
       9.1.5. All telephone instruments within the CAT will be equipped with push-to-talk
       handsets.
10. Crisis Action Team Briefing Requirements.
   10.1. Briefings inform members of tasking, current situation and status, and limitations
   affecting task accomplishment. There are three standard briefings conducted within the
   CAT, the Immediate, the Quick Look and the Readiness Status Briefing. The 21 SW/CC
   may include or delete briefings as necessary depending on the situation.
   10.2. The Immediate Briefing provides the CAT a rapid overview of the situation as
   members arrive and sign in.
   10.3. The Quick Look Briefing will provide a summary of the situation that caused
   activation, including known information, potential courses of action, response requirements
   and or capabilities.
   10.4. The Readiness Status Briefings will take place at regular intervals or as directed as part
   of the battle rhythm. Readiness briefings are a review of current and projected operations and
   status across the wing.
   10.5. Briefing compilation is the responsibility of the fusion cell and inputs must be
   coordinated with the director and deputy director. The fusion cell ensures all associates are
   notified of scheduled briefing times and time changes. Associates must notify any outside
   agencies of the briefing times for their specific area. Inputs to the briefings must be received
   no later than 60 minutes prior to scheduled briefing time.
   10.6. The director and deputy director will ensure the facility is secure prior to presentation
   of any unclassified or classified briefings.
11. Battle Rhythm.
   11.1. The 21 SW battle rhythm is based on the situation and the direction of the commander.
   The battle rhythm ensures members are aware of the reporting timelines, member rest period
   and the required briefing times.
12. Physical Security / Entry Control.
   12.1. The PICC crew is responsible for controlling entry to the primary and alternate
   facilities during normal operations. Crisis Action Team entry control members control entry
   when the CAT is activated. Prior to assuming entry control, the PICC crew will brief the
   entry controller on his/her responsibilities and provide all required Entry Authority Lists,
   badges and IMT AF 1109, Visitor Register Log.
21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011                                                                          15


   12.2. The entry controller will inspect all bags prior to allowing entry into the facility. Bags
   will be identified as checked by using the PICC bag tags and placing them on the bag visible
   for easy identification.
   12.3. Entry. The PICC determines the requirements for PICC and CAT security. The
   primary facility at Building 845, consisting of the PICC and CAT rooms, is designated a
   Protection Level 3 (PL 3) restricted area. All members must have and display a valid
   Automated Entry Control Card (AECC) while in the restricted area. Members will also be
   listed on the Entry Access List (EAL). Those without an AECC must be signed in on a
   visitor register and escorted while in the restricted area. The alternate facility at Building
   1158 is a PL 4 area until the CAT is activated. When activated, Building 1158 PICC and
   CAT are designated a PL 3 restricted area and all rules apply for a restricted area.

Terms
Crisis Action Team—A team formed by the 21 SW/CC to plan, direct, and coordinate forces in
response to contingency and crisis situations. This includes developing courses of action and
executing commander and HHQ directives. In the 21 SW, the wing CAT is divided into two
teams; ―A‖ and ―B‖ teams with appropriate alternates.
Crisis Action Team Associate—An organization that does not provide sitting representatives to
the CAT, but these representatives are present when necessary to receive or provide briefings
and updates. Otherwise, associates operate out of their respective work areas. Examples include
Intelligence, Weather, and AFOSI.
Command Cell—The CAT command element providing overall command of and direction
regarding wing mission execution. The Command Cell consists of the 21 SW/CC/CV,
Operations Group Commander, Mission Support Group Commander, and Medical Group
Commander. As necessary the 302 AW/CC may be notified and asked to participate by
providing 302 AW expertise.
Fusion Cell—The CAT element that consolidates inputs and compiles them into an overview of
wing status and capability for the Command Cell.
 18                                                                21SWI10-221 5 MAY 2011


Group Control Center—A center established to provide direction and or information to the
Unit Control Centers. Normally the GCC receives data from the CAT, and re-issues to the
UCCs. The UCCs accomplish all GCC directed actions. Once complete, the UCC notifies the
GCC who notifies the CAT.
Significant Event—An event that will affect or has affected the status or capability of a 21 SW
unit, and must be reacted to by the wing CAT. A wide range of events can fit into this category,
from a natural disaster at Peterson AFB to failure of a system at a wing GSU.
Space Control Team—A cross-functional specialty team that interacts with space control
squadrons and coordinates unit mission activities. The SCT consists of operations, plans,
maintenance, and mission support personnel with a team leader. The SCT falls under the
operational control of the Operations Group Commander.
Unit Control Center—A contingency staff within a unit (normally a squadron or staff agency)
that monitors unit resources and capability and coordinates unit activities during a crisis or
contingency. UCCs are primarily formed by organizations on Peterson AFB or Cheyenne
Mountain AFS. UCCs support the Group Control Centers in planning, directing, coordinating,
and controlling unit activities.

A2.1. Shift Times: (members need to arrive 15 minutes early for change-over)
A2.2. A Team: Dependent on recall time, normally 12 hour shifts, B Team: Dependent on recall
time, normally 12 hour shifts. * Note: Each position is required to have one (1) alternate
individual designated per position. Designating a different representative for each alternate
position is optimal, but not required, i.e. you can have the same alternate for A, and/or B team.
The same individual cannot backup two billet requirements, so a second representative must be
designated.
