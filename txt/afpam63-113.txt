                                             Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Program protection is a critical element of the Integrated Life Cycle
Management (ILCM) of weapon systems and services. The Program Protection Plan (PPP)
documents program decisions to ensure that technology, components, and information are
adequately protected. For the latest PPP template reference Defense Acquisition Guidebook,
Chapter 13. The protection planning process is intended to help program offices consciously
think through what needs to be protected and to develop a plan that describes protection
techniques as well as addresses the risk management for what cannot be adequately protected.
Chapter 2 details the basic roles and responsibilities of key participants in implementing program
protection. Chapter 3 of this pamphlet focuses on the process requirements that program
managers should use for conducting sound program protection and covers all the functional parts
of program protection. Chapter 4 shows the logical flow of procedures for program protection.
Chapter 5 explains how program protection methods work throughout the life cycle of the
acquisition framework. The PPP should be a current and useable reference (regardless of the life
cycle phase) for understanding and managing the full spectrum of program and systems security
activities. It is updated as the system develops, as the program’s critical assets are identified, and
as threats or vulnerabilities change (or are better understood).
1.2. Purpose. This pamphlet provides Program Managers (PM) with recommended protection
planning activities for the integrated management of systems security risks. Risks to Air Force
systems’ advanced technology and mission-critical functionality can come from foreign
intelligence services, design vulnerability, supply chain compromise, cyber or advanced
persistent threats, or battlefield loss at any point in the system’s life cycle. This pamphlet
provides the procedures for the identification and protection of Critical Program Information
(CPI) and critical components.
   1.2.1. Technology and acquisition programs (including testing and sustainment activities)
   must be protected against hostile or criminal activities to keep technological advantages in
   and malicious or counterfeit content out.
   1.2.2. In accordance with (IAW) DoDI 5200.39, DoDI O-5240.24, DoDI 3020.46, and DoDI
   5200.44, program protection is focused on protecting CPI (leading edge research &
   technology and information about applications, processes, capabilities and end-items) and
   critical components. This is broken down as shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1. Comprehensive Program Protection Focus Areas.




1.3. Core Activities. PMs develop and apply comprehensive program protection in order to
provide secure, uncompromised military systems to the warfighter. For the purposes of this
pamphlet and the program protection process, the term program applies to technology,
acquisition, sustainment activities and research and development projects; the term PM refers to
the designated individual with responsibility for and authority to execute a program, including
sustainment efforts. This pamphlet provides procedures to implement guidance for programs to
preserve the effectiveness of military systems through appropriate protection and risk
management strategies. Program protection activities consist of:
     1.3.1. Designing in resilience and agility to maintain mission assurance if a system or sub-
     system is compromised. Redundancy, diversity, and distribution can enhance resilience;
     nimbleness and adaptability enhance agility.
     1.3.2. Identifying critical components as well as inherited or organic CPI early in a
     technology or system life cycle and continuing to assess for CPI or critical components as
     part of the ILCM process IAW DoDI 5200.39. PMs are required to assess their programs
     for CPI and critical components any time there is a significant configuration change, or an
     actual or suspected compromise of the system or its industrial base.
     1.3.3. Assessing and identifying threats and vulnerabilities to CPI and critical components.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      7


   1.3.4. Protecting and mitigating the compromise of CPI and critical components through the
   integrated and synchronized application of counterintelligence (CI), intelligence, security,
   systems engineering, information assurance, Anti-Tamper, and other defensive
   countermeasures to mitigate risks; then documenting program protection decisions in a PPP
   classified by content.
   1.3.5. Conducting comparative analysis of similar program CPI, as well as cases of cyber
   attacks and CPI exfiltration, and aligning protection activities horizontally through the use of
   the DoD Acquisition Security Database (ASDB).
   1.3.6. Minimizing and managing the risk that the program capability will be impaired due to
   malicious or criminal compromise of the supply chain. PMs are required to manage the risk
   that counterfeit or maliciously altered parts may enter and degrade a system or introduce
   unknown content. (see DoDI 5200.44)
   1.3.7. Ensuring that contractual language requires contractors to participate in program
   protection.
1.4. Applicability. All programs are required to perform protection planning IAW DoDI
5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, DoDI 5200.39, and AFI 63-101/20-101.
This includes any modification IAW AFI 63-131, Modification Program Management for
programs in the Operation and Sustainment (O&S) Phase. All new and legacy systems
(regardless of whether they have CPI) must address mission critical functions and components
requiring risk management to protect capabilities.
   1.4.1. Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs. Per AFI 63-101/20-101, all ACATs require
   a PPP for Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) review and approval at every milestone
   (beginning at Milestone [MS] A). The PM updates the PPP at each subsequent milestone and
   the Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision. The PM should consider the impact of
   configuration changes and update the PPP as necessary. For legacy systems, PPP
   requirements for modifications can be satisfied by updating or annexing an existing PPP,
   creating a PPP for individual modification efforts, or creating a PPP for the entire weapon
   system addressing all modification protection measures with provisions for annexes to cover
   future modifications.
   1.4.2. Technology Projects Planned for Transition. Technology projects requiring a formal
   Technology Transition Plan (TTP) should document CPI in a PPP. If an AT plan is required,
   it should be provided to the Transition Agent as a classified annex to the PPP. Research and
   technology projects that develop advanced or unique technology must develop a PPP.
   1.4.3. Nuclear Systems. Nuclear components governed by DoDI 5030.55, DOD procedures
   for Joint DOD-DOE Nuclear Weapon Life-Cycle Activities, AFI 63-103, Joint Air Force-
   National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle
   Management and DoD-DoE and/or Air Force-National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-
   NNSA) agreements are exempt. All other components and information that are part of
   nuclear systems should use this pamphlet as a guide for program protection.
   1.4.4. Special Access Programs (SAP). Special Access Programs (SAPs) are managed in
   accordance with DoDD 5205.07, DoDI 5205.11, AFPD 16-7, and AFI 16-701. SAP program
   managers are required to develop PPPs or an alternative document that combines program
   protection and other aspects of program security per DoDI 5205.11.

    1.4.5. Defense Business Systems (DBS). PMs for DBS meeting any of the criteria in DoDI
    5200.44 must identify critical components and document risk mitigations in a PPP.
    1.4.6. Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Programs. QRC programs are required to assess
    program protection requirements IAW AFI 63-114. The requirement for a full PPP is then
    assessed at the Capability Transition Review (CTR).
    1.4.7. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). FMS and DCS
    programs should prepare a PPP and follow the guidance in this document.

                                          Chapter 3

                      PROGRAM PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Overview. The objective of program protection is to maintain military advantage. Program
protection should also preserve information, property, and supply chain integrity to assure the
intended capability for its life cycle. This chapter will focus on the key concepts and process
requirements for conducting sound program protection. Each PM should determine the
program’s unique requirements and tailor a protection approach which both satisfies regulatory
guidance and is, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with risk management and
capability requirements.
   3.1.1. Protection planning is a risk-based process for selecting cost-effective
   countermeasures to protect CPI and critical components. Protection is tailored to the
   program based on the manner in which the CPI and critical components manifest themselves
   (information, technology, or component). Program protection is discussed at technical and
   program reviews.
   3.1.2. The PPP describes the program’s mission-critical functions as well as its CPI and
   critical components providing, protecting, or having unrestricted access to mission-critical
   functions. The PPP documents the threats to, and vulnerabilities of its CPI and critical
   components; describes the program’s risk management approach; details the selection,
   application, and estimated cost of countermeasures to mitigate associated risks; and describes
   all foreign involvement.
   3.1.3. A PPP should reflect the current protection planning for each program’s unique
   situation throughout the acquisition life cycle.     Program protection requires close
   coordination among functional disciplines, user communities and contractors.
   3.1.4. PPP development includes working with the Product Support Manager (PSM) and the
   logistics community to build in protection-related sustainment requirements.
   3.1.5. A PPP template and detailed information on how program planning is accomplished
   beyond what is covered in this pamphlet is in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG)
   Chapter 13.
3.2. Tailoring. Tailoring provides the ability to integrate, consolidate, incorporate, and
streamline strategies, oversight, reviews, decision levels, documentation, and information.
MDAs should promote maximum flexibility in tailoring programs under their oversight to fit
particular conditions of that program, consistent with applicable laws and regulations and the
time sensitivity of the capability need. The MDA ensures PPPs are tailored to 1) provide the
needed capability to the warfighter in the shortest practical time, 2) balance risk, 3) ensure
affordability and supportability, and 4) provide adequate information for decision making.
Reference AFPAM 63-128 for more information on tailoring.
   3.2.1. The PM documents the tailoring strategy, including the supporting rationale and
   citation to the applicable statute or regulation in the Acquisition Strategy (AS) and/or
   Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) for the MDA’s approval.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   13


   3.2.2. MDAs and PMs should tailor within the scope of the applicable statute or regulation.
   MDAs have tailoring authority over programmatic execution requirements except where
   stated in statute or regulation.
   3.2.3. Care should be taken to not waive requirements when the waiver authority resides
   outside MDA authority. Waiver authority, other than those explicitly defined, belongs to the
   publication or requirement owner. A waiver is an expressed or written statement to
   relinquish or provide exceptions to specific statutory or regulatory requirement.
3.3. Information Assurance (IA). The Information Assurance Strategy (IAS) is a required
annex of the PPP that is submitted to meet the program’s IA requirement for Clinger-Cohen Act
compliance. If the program does not have IA requirements, the Annex should so state.
Technology projects may document the IAS in accordance with local policy. See DoDI 8580.1,
Information Assurance (IA) in the Defense Acquisition System, DoDI 8500.2, Information
Assurance (IA) Implementation, AFI 33-200, and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and
Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP) for required IA processes.
   3.3.1. Determine if the system has Platform IT (PIT), Platform IT Interconnections (PITI), or
   DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation (DIACAP) requirements. See
   Attachment 9 for PIT Determination Checklist template. If the program is or contains PIT,
   ensure candidate PIT components are identified, systems security requirements are verified,
   and PIT determinations are documented in the Information Assurance Strategy (IAS) annex
   of the PPP IAW DoDI 8500.02, and AFI 33-210.
3.4. Software Assurance. Software Assurance must be addressed in the PPP.                  This
encompasses not only development activities, but also the security of the processes used to
handle software components during their sourcing, development and distribution. (See DoDI
5200.44) Specifically, the PPP should detail how software will be designed and tested to assure
protection of critical functionality and CPI. PMs will monitor CPIs and Critical Intelligence
Parameters as part of their Risk Management Plan (as defined in AFI 63-101/20-101).
3.5. Anti-Tamper (AT). AT measures are intended to prevent and/or delay exploitation of
Resident CPI in U.S. weapon systems. SAF/AQLS serves as the USAF AT Lead. The office is
responsible for reviewing AT Plans for horizontal protection and ensuring Resident CPI and
provisos are protected from reverse-engineering. Provisos require AT protection only if required
by the Tri-Service Committee or other National Disclosure Policy. Two main sources of reverse-
engineering include Foreign Military Sales (including a company’s Direct Commercial Sales),
and battlefield losses. The USAF AT Lead approves Direct Commercial Sales AT Plans and
coordinates on domestic and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) AT Plans. For further clarification
on AT measures contact the USAF AT Lead.
   3.5.1. The PM must ensure all CPI is assessed and threats to CPI are continually monitored
   to determine if AT measures are required and appropriate. AT is incorporated into the
   program’s systems engineering processes and should be discussed at system engineering
   technical reviews (see Figure 5.1 for examples of relevant reviews within the acquisition life
   cycle). Although not all programs will require an AT plan, the PM must consider application
   of AT measures to protect CPI resident on any system that has foreign participation (e.g.
   developed with allied partners), is likely to be sold or provided to U.S. allies and friendly
   foreign governments, or might fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. If a program has no
 14                                                    AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


   CPI or the PM believes the program has no AT requirements, then the PM should coordinate
   with SAF/AQL for a waiver recommendation letter to the MDA.
   3.5.2. Early in the program’s life cycle (MS A), (Fig 3.1.), PMs will follow published AT
   guidance or direction provided by SAF/AQLS for planning, validation, and documentation of
   AT effectiveness measures. The USAF AT Lead provides a suite of CPI identification tools
   to help determine if a program has Resident CPI. To register for CPI Tools, contact your
   local AT Representative. An approved initial AT Plan must have concurrence by USAF AT
   Lead for all Foreign Military Sales (FMS), while the initial AT Plan must be approved for
   Direct Commercial Sales programs.
   3.5.3. The USAF AT Lead provides assessment reports of Commercial Off The Shelf
   (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) products used in the protection of R-CPI. The
   USAF AT Lead also provides information on what the other Services are doing relative to
   AT practices, and of associated costs.

Figure 3.1. Anti-Tamper Evaluation Points (EP) for Programs.




   3.5.4. AT Plans should be submitted NLT 60 days (and, to allow for Formal OUSD PPP
   coordination, 90 days for ACAT ID programs) before corresponding acquisition program
   milestone and ideally 120 days prior. The MS-A AT Concept (EP 1) includes a technical
   approach and cost estimate to initially price AT for the program. The MS-B/PDR AT Plan
   (EP 2) includes an updated resident CPI list and AT protection implementations. The CDR
   AT Plan and CDR AT V&V Procedures (EP 3) detail AT implementation. The MS-C AT
   V&V Report (EP 4) describes step by step AT V&V completion to ensure AT has been
   implemented properly.
   3.5.5. The Acquisition Security Database (ASDB) is used to store USAF (and other
   Services’) AT Plans. Upload and submit SECRET (collateral) domestic, FMS, and Direct
   Commercial Sales AT Plans via the ASDB. All AT Plans must be at least SECRET
   (collateral) per AT Security Classification Guide (SCG). Contact SAF/AQLS to submit
   plans classified higher than SECRET (collateral). ASDB Accounts are available on Secret
   Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).
   3.5.6. The PM should document the analysis and recommendation to use or not to use anti-
   tamper measures in a classified annex to the PPP, and report findings to the MDA at
   Milestone A and subsequent decision points in the life of the program. The USAF AT Lead
   will provide an AT recommendation. The MDA will review the AT recommendation from
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   15


   SAF/AQLS to reach an approval decision concerning the PM’s recommended AT measures
   in the classified annex of the PPP.
   3.5.7. The PM should reassess AT implementation for configuration changes.
3.6. Horizontal Protection. Horizontal Protection ensures that effective common
countermeasures are used by programs that utilize similar CPI, yielding cost-effective
applications of technology protection efforts. PEO AT Leads should assist the PEO Director of
Engineering in validating each FMS and DCS program’s R-CPI. Whenever possible, PMs
should leverage the risk mitigation efforts of like programs in developing their own
countermeasures. The ASDB is DoD’s tool for the horizontal protection process. The PM
should:
   3.6.1. Review CPI data in the DoD ASDB and utilize the database to address any horizontal
   protection issues. See Chapter 4 for further details regarding the ASDB.
   3.6.2. Coordinate with other affected program(s) when disputes involving the level of risk
   mitigation applied to shared or similar CPI arise. The PM’s goal should be to understand,
   document, and communicate unacceptable risk mitigation differences to the affected
   program(s). If risk mitigation results in unacceptable or potentially unacceptable mission
   impact, the PM should report this to the MDA and courtesy copy the findings to affected
   program’s (s’) MDA and MAJCOM program protection POC for further action. Identical
   countermeasures are not necessarily required in each program. The PM’s goal should be to
   achieve a commensurate level of risk mitigation acceptable by affected programs.
   3.6.3. Coordinate with counterintelligence elements on horizontal protection and analysis
   issues involving the protection of CPI.
   3.6.4. Maintain continuity of protection with respect to inherited CPI. Inherited CPI is CPI
   from other acquisition programs, subsystems, or projects that are being incorporated or
   implemented into another program.
3.7. Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN). TSN requirements have been developed
(reference DoDI 5200.44) to minimize the risk that mission capability will be impaired due to
vulnerabilities in system design or sabotage or subversion of a system’s critical functions or
critical components by foreign intelligence, terrorists, malicious insiders, and other hostile or
criminal elements. TSN strategy integrates robust systems engineering, Supply Chain Risk
Management (SCRM), security, counterintelligence, intelligence, information assurance,
hardware and software assurance, and information systems security engineering disciplines to
manage risks to system integrity and trust. SCRM is a subset of program protection that
identifies susceptibilities, vulnerabilities and threats throughout DoD’s “supply chain” and
develops mitigation strategies to combat those threats. TSN requirements must be incorporated
into the program’s acquisition, systems engineering, and information assurance processes. TSN
processes such as critical function analysis and protection is a discussion item at System
Engineering Technical Reviews (SETR).
   3.7.1. PM Implementation Activities:
       3.7.1.1. Conduct comprehensive program protection analysis and mitigation to identify
       and protect critical components and information. PMs should assess threats and mitigate
       system security risks using cost-effective best practices such as secure system design.
 16                                                     AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


      3.7.1.2. Employ enhanced vulnerability detection tools when available. Continually
      assess mitigations and respond to new threats and vulnerabilities in critical components
      (e.g. cyber threats to programmable logic elements). As the system design evolves,
      criticality analysis, vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, threat analysis, and
      countermeasure selection must be reconsidered to reflect the current threat picture IAW
      DoDI 5200.39. (See Figure 3.2)
      3.7.1.3. Contact the AFMC or AFSPC TSN focal point when critical components have
      been identified.

Figure 3.2. Criticality Analysis and Vulnerability Assessment Methodology.




   3.7.2. TSN Focal Point Activities. The MAJCOM TSN focal point will provide the PM the
   appropriate threat information and potential mitigation options. The AFMC and AFSPC
   MAJCOM TSN focal points:
      3.7.2.1. Coordinate and prioritize RFIs to the DIA SCRM TAC for threats to suppliers of
      critical components.
      3.7.2.2. Coordinate with AFOSI to obtain assessments of suppliers of critical
      components and provide analysis of critical component supplier intelligence to the PM.
      3.7.2.3. Provide PMs with key practices, and recommended strategies for vulnerability
      detection and risk mitigation to protect critical components upon request.
   3.7.3. Mitigations. The PM should use intelligence assessments (such as SCRM TAC
   reports) on critical components to inform risk management decisions, including source
   selection. The PM should ensure the use of risk mitigations, such as SCRM Key Practices,
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  17


  during the design of critical functions and prior to the acquisition of critical components or
  their integration within a system.
     3.7.3.1. Secure System Design. Early in the system development life cycle, PMs should
     consider systems designs that reduce vulnerabilities of critical functions. PMs should
     apply assurance principles such as minimizing user privileges, reducing vulnerabilities,
     standardizing and simplifying architectures, increasing redundancy, diversity, and
     distribution for survivability, increasing agility through adaptability and reconstitution.
     PMs should consider, prioritize, and evaluate security attributes as part of overall system
     trade studies. PMs and Lead Systems Engineer should consider designs that mitigate
     supplier risk of a component. MIL-HDBK-1785, Systems Security Engineering Program
     Management Requirements, defines systems security engineering tasks and provides
     implementation guidance. See Chapter 5.
     3.7.3.2. Key Practices. PMs will decide how to implement key practices obtained from
     the AFMC or AFSPC MAJCOM TSN focal point. These include, but are not limited to,
     diversifying sources including second and third tier suppliers, buying all supplies up
     front, limiting delivery times, and increasing supply chain transparency. For more
     information, reference DoDI 5200.44, the DoD SCRM Key Practices and Implementation
     Guide, and the DoD PPP Guidance in the Defense Acquisition Guide (DAG).
     3.7.3.3. Trusted Suppliers. In accordance with DoDI 5200.44, in applicable systems,
     integrated circuit-related products and services are required to be procured from a trusted
     supplier accredited by the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) when they are
     custom-designed, custom-manufactured, or tailored for a specific DoD military end use.
     The PM may also use accredited suppliers as best practice and risk mitigation concerns
     dictate.    Specifically this direction applies to circuits which are custom-designed,
     custom-manufactured, or tailored for a specific DoD military end use (generally referred
     to as application specific integrated circuits or ASICS).
     3.7.3.4. Use of the AF Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) Contracts . The Air
     Force has established a series of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ)
     contracts to ensure adherence to Air Force Enterprise Architecture and allow for SCRM
     control mechanisms. PMs should use the NETCENTS contracts in the acquisition
     strategy of any ICT products or services when feasible and where it achieves an effective
     acquisition strategy. The NETCENTS-2 ID/IQ contracts include the following categories
     of ICT products and services in their scope: COTS Net-centric Products, Network
     Operations (NETOPS) and Infrastructure Solutions, Application Services, Enterprise
     Integration and Service Management (EISM) Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS),
     and IT Professional Support and Engineering Services (ITPS) A&AS. NETCENTS-2
     includes the following best practices to mitigate supply chain risk:
         3.7.3.4.1. Requires refurbished products to be clearly identified as such.
         3.7.3.4.2. Directs delivery orders to be TEMPEST compliant when required IAW Air
         Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency Instruction
         (AFISRAI)      Checklist     90-203;     AFISRAI   33-203,   National     Security
         Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory Memorandum
         (NSTISSAM) TEMPEST/2-95; and National Security Telecommunications and
         Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 7003, Annex B.
 18                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


           3.7.3.4.3. Requires the contractor to maintain a supplier inspection system.
           3.7.3.4.4. Directs vendors to follow all Trade Agreements.
           3.7.3.4.5. Requires all IA or IA-enabled IT products to be National Security
           Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy Number 11
           (NSTISSP-11) compliant.
           3.7.3.4.6. Requires the vendor to provide all associated software and associated
           peripherals as provided by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).
   3.7.4. Documentation. Current DoD PPP direction requires the PM to l document the results
   of the criticality analysis and all TSN protection activities in the PPP. This includes:
       3.7.4.1. Mission critical functions.
       3.7.4.2. Critical components.
       3.7.4.3. Criticality Levels (I, II, III, IV) for each identified critical component.
       Criticality is assessed by the relative impact on the system’s ability to complete its
       mission if the component fails. Level I is total mission failure, Level II is
       significant/unacceptable degradation, Level III is partial/acceptable, and Level IV is
       negligible. See Appendix C of the PPP Outline and Guidance.
       3.7.4.4. TSN planning and mitigation activities, including supplier risk decisions.
       3.7.4.5. Significant threats that cannot be reasonably addressed through technical
       mitigation and countermeasures, and for which procedures have not been established.
3.8. Counterfeit Prevention. The objective of the AF counterfeit parts prevention capability is
to ensure appropriate risk mitigations and protection of components in AF weapon systems and
information systems throughout their life cycles. Per DoDI 5200.44, PMs are required to
identify critical components vulnerable to counterfeiting, and maintain an updated list throughout
the system life cycle. The term component includes software and hardware articles. As part of
program protection, counterfeit prevention should be assessed at program reviews. PMs should
ensure that contracts include language requiring prime contractors to take preventative steps at
all levels of the supply chain based on risk to system integrity and to commit suppliers to provide
authentic hardware, software, and firmware. The Defense Contract Management Agency
(DCMA) works directly with DoD suppliers to ensure compliance with contractual terms and
conditions. See the USD (AT&L) Supply Chain Integration website and DoDI 4140.01, DoD
Supply Chain Materiel Management Policy, for further guidance on counterfeit materiel
management. The PM should implement the following actions to mitigate the risk of
incorporating any counterfeit parts into any systems:
   3.8.1. Planning and Preventative Actions. Establish planning and preventative measures to
   mitigate counterfeiting risks and manage residual risk throughout the life cycle. See MIL-
   STD-3018, DoD Standard Practice for Parts Management, Standardization Document (SD)-
   19, Parts Management Guide, and SD-22, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material
   Shortages (DMSMS) Guidebook.
       3.8.1.1. Collaborate with contractor to implement security business practices in
       engineering, component purchasing, test and evaluation, manufacturing, and sustainment
       to mitigate threats to the supply chain of weapon systems.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  19


     3.8.1.2. Include robust design features to minimize vulnerabilities.
     3.8.1.3. Define criteria for determining critical components vulnerable to counterfeiting
     (e.g., critical points of operational failure, rankings of risk and consequences of
     component failure based on criticality analysis).
     3.8.1.4. Determine critical components that have a global supply chain. Consider using
     emerging industry standards such as those from the Independent Distributors of
     Electronics Association (IDEA) and the Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE) for
     practices and methods to mitigate risks from counterfeit electronic parts. Consider
     requiring contractual compliance with the standard adopted by DoD for counterfeit
     electronics, SAE Aerospace Standard (AS) 5553, Counterfeit Electronic Parts;
     Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition, for critical components with a global
     supply chain.
     3.8.1.5. Define triggers for alerts on counterfeits during fielding, pre-fielding, and
     inventory receipt processing (duplicate serial numbers in systems, physical inspection).
     3.8.1.6. Determine life cycle events which provide opportunities for reviewing program
     protection efforts to prevent counterfeit materiel from entering a system’s supply chain
     (technical reviews, milestone reviews, sustainment planning).
     3.8.1.7. Determine how much risk is acceptable commensurate with threat, vulnerability,
     and consequences and adjust procurement strategy accordingly.
     3.8.1.8. Avoid risky suppliers when possible.
     3.8.1.9. Use original manufacturers or trusted suppliers whenever possible.
     3.8.1.10. Require suppliers and contractors to provide notification when critical items are
     not obtained from the Original Equipment Manufacturer or an authorized distributor,
     particularly when electronic parts are included. This requirement should apply to
     suppliers below the prime contract as well.
     3.8.1.11. Establish testing and verification requirements for items not received from an
     original equipment manufacturer, or authorized distributor that are identified as having
     high risk for counterfeit potential. These requirements apply to prime contracts, and to
     subcontracts or suppliers below the prime contracts.
     3.8.1.12. Require traceability of parts origination and distribution.
     3.8.1.13. Require product support providers (organic and contractors) to identify
     obsolete components.
     3.8.1.14. Require that all personnel involved in the program receive initial training on
     anti-counterfeiting techniques and that those involved in the management of parts and
     DMSMS programs receive detailed training in anti-counterfeiting techniques. Further
     guidance is available at the USD (AT&L) Supply Chain Integration website.
     3.8.1.15. Ensure CPI and critical components are documented in the PPP. Catalog
     critical components by National Stock Number (NSN), if applicable, with associated
     inventory indicative data. CPI and critical components may require specialized item
     management and/or inventory control. This approach should be discussed in the Systems
     Engineering Plan (SEP) or the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). The Item Unique

     Identification (IUID) Implementation Plan includes the identified items. Reference DoDI
     8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property.
     3.8.1.16. Specify flow-down of applicable requirements regarding counterfeit parts to
     lower tier suppliers and maintain processes to verify such requirements.
     3.8.1.17. Require static testing for critical software components.
     3.8.1.18. Ensure software development contractors use sanitized compilers and testing
     tools.
     3.8.1.19. Establish processes and procedures that ensures all software (including
     updates) originates from an authentic supplier. Validated CDs should be used to the
     maximum extent possible for software uploads. Website usage should be discouraged as
     counterfeit software suppliers are proficient at creating legitimate-appearing sites. When
     website downloads cannot be avoided, processes and procedures should be established to
     ensure downloaded code is appropriately validated.
  3.8.2. Supplier Control Actions. Determine supplier control measures and actions including
  the following minimum set of counterfeit control measures:
     3.8.2.1. Distributor assessments.
     3.8.2.2. Product assurance processes.
         3.8.2.2.1. Authenticity verification techniques.
         3.8.2.2.2. Counterfeit material detection processes.
     3.8.2.3. Materiel control processes. Determine the materiel control processes required
     for those who store, handle, or ship program materiel. Materiel control processes should
     ensure effectiveness in preventing counterfeit materiel and materials from entering the
     program’s life cycle at any point in the acquisition process. The PM should ensure
     determination is made for the following activities:
         3.8.2.3.1. Storage.
         3.8.2.3.2. Handling.
         3.8.2.3.3. Shipping.
     3.8.2.4. Counterfeit materiel disposition processes. Implement a counterfeit materiel
     disposition process to ensure counterfeit materiel is removed once discovered. The chain
     of custody must be preserved. The materiel and relevant data should be sequestered for
     analysis by cognizant security personnel.
     3.8.2.5. Reporting processes. PMs should ensure all instances of counterfeit or suspect
     counterfeit parts are reported in the Government and Industry Data Exchange Program
     (GIDEP) database and to the MAJCOM TSN focal point.
     3.8.2.6. Feedback Loop. Monitor, report, investigate, and eliminate known and
     suspected breaches to in-service inventory assets.
  3.8.3. Consequence Management Actions. Retain possession of confirmed or suspect
  counterfeit items. Manage infiltration of suspected or confirmed counterfeit parts into your
  supply chain IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Chapter 16, “Management of
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   21


   Suspect Counterfeit and Counterfeit Materiel.” Reference AFI 51-1101, The Air Force
   Procurement Fraud Remedies Program and AFI 91-202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program. Programs should immediately notify their supporting contracting
   officer of confirmed or suspected counterfeit parts. Additionally, report suspected or
   confirmed counterfeit items discovered by DoD activities in the Government-Industry Data
   Exchange Program (GIDEP) using the Product Quality Deficiency Reporting process as
   appropriate.
3.9. Compromised CPI. The PM is required to provide written notification of any actual or
potential compromise of US Government information designated as CPI (classified or
unclassified) to local AFOSI CI and security officials IAW DoDD O-5240.02,
Counterintelligence, DoDI 5240.04, Counterintelligence (CI) Investigations, DoDI 5200.39,
DoDM 5200.01 v1, DoD Information Security Program, DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management. This reporting ensures incidents are properly investigated and the necessary
actions are taken to negate or minimize the adverse effects of the loss or compromise of CPI, and
to preclude recurrence.
   3.9.1. Incidents involving the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) or proprietary information
   where CPI is present will be managed under the provisions of DoDI 5205.13, Defense
   Industrial Base (DIB) Cyber Security/Information Assurance (CS/IA) Activities (for DIB
   CS/IA Framework Agreement signatories only) and AFI 33-200.
   3.9.2. Incidents involving the AF Global Information Grid (GIG) where CPI is present will
   be managed under the provisions of AFI 10-712, Telecommunications Monitoring and
   Assessment Program (TMAP) to initiate a Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA).
   3.9.3. Incidents involving electronic communication of classified information and/or
   Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment, whether test, evaluation or operational use
   should be reported IAW AFI33-200 and the supporting AFMAN 33-283, COMSEC, or
   AFMAN 33-386, TEMPEST Security, as appropriate.
3.10. Compromised Critical Components. The PM is required to provide written notification
of any actual or potential compromise of an item identified as a “critical component” (classified
or unclassified) to local AFOSI CI and security officials IAW guidance cited above. If there is a
suspected or confirmed compromise of critical components, then the PM must assume there has
been a potentially damaging malicious insertion into the system.           However, criminal or
malicious determination is not a PM’s decision. Reference DoDI 5200.44, the DoD SCRM Key
Practices and Implementation Guide (Key Practice 30) and the DoD PPP Guidance in the DAG.
3.11. Foreign Involvement. The PM should, with the support of DIA and TSN focal points,
assess all suppliers of critical components for Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI).
The PM should assess all items being considered for export or foreign involvement, including
operation or testing, to determine if any additional protection countermeasures need to be
designed-in or implemented to protect CPI and critical components. The PM should review all
items, components, test activities, and data support packages for CPI and critical components and
protect accordingly, to include working with the contracting officer to determine if contract
changes are required. SAF/IAPD is the approval authority for delegated disclosure authority to
the Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) in support of both one-time and continuing disclosure
requirements. Programs with foreign involvement are required to comply with the following
 22                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013

DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM); and AFI
16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program:
   3.11.1. When it has been determined there will be foreign involvement (e.g. cooperative
   research and development, production, test, maintenance, training), or work performed for
   the US by companies under FOCI, the PM is required to prepare a Technology
   Assessment/Control Plan (TA/CP), Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL), and
   Program Security Instruction (PSI) prior to formal engagement. (Reference DoDD 5530.03)
   The TA/CP annex to the PPP identifies security arrangements for international programs and
   is used to:
       3.11.1.1. Document all FMS transactions or international agreements and cooperation
       involving the transfer of CPI to specific countries.
       3.11.1.2. Assess the feasibility of the United States' participation in joint programs from
       a foreign disclosure and technical security perspective.
       3.11.1.3. Prepare negotiation guidance on the transfer of classified information and
       Resident CPI involved in the negotiation of international agreements.
       3.11.1.4. Draft the DDL that provides specific guidance on proposed disclosures.
       3.11.1.5. Plan for Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Hybrid FMS-Direct Commercial Sales,
       and co-production or licensed production of the system or international cooperative
       agreements involving U.S. technology or processes.
       3.11.1.6. Recommend the extent and timing of foreign involvement in the program,
       foreign sales, and access to program information by foreign entities.
   3.11.2. The PM is required to adhere to overall systems protection requirements during the
   disclosure of CPI to foreign governments and international organizations in support of
   international programs.
   3.11.3. The PM should confirm Air Force information authorized in the DDL is
   representative of the item being sold or considered for sale, development, or transfer.
   3.11.4. The PM should develop a PSI prior to formal engagement (NOTE: The PSI is only
   required for foreign co-development programs).
   3.11.5. The PM must document all FMS transactions or international agreements and
   cooperation involving the transfer of CPI to specific countries in the PPP’s TA/CP annex.
   The TA/CP annex will take into account the review of all export provisions already in place
   i.e. DDL's commercial, and other DoD service exports.
   3.11.6. The PM must confirm CPI protective countermeasures are adequate prior to the
   export of the CPI to foreign governments and international organizations.
   3.11.7. The PM should provide the FMS Case Manager or international agreement Project
   Officer with protection guidance, including countermeasures, for all items/components that
   will include CPI or critical components.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      23


   3.11.8. The PM must conduct and document a follow-on support analysis, normally as part
   of the foreign sales portion of the TA/CP, to ensure compliance with protection
   considerations.
   3.11.9. The PM should address information assurance and protection of critical U.S. systems
   giving special consideration to vulnerabilities resulting from reliance on the information
   support infrastructure and the risk of their loss, damage, or destruction.
3.12. Counterintelligence Support. PMs must seek counterintelligence support for all CPI and
critical components threat determinations. AFOSI provides the following CI support to assist the
PM in assessing threats and developing appropriate countermeasures IAW DoDI O-5240.24:
   3.12.1. Supporting the PM with development and implementation of a CI Support Plan
   (CISP). The CISP describes CI activities in support of the program.
   3.12.2. Preparing Counterintelligence Threat Assessment (CITA). Programs must request
   CITAs upon initial identification of CPI and critical components and upon any programmatic
   changes affecting CPI and critical components (i.e., locations, system configurations,
   contractor involvement). PMs will ensure their local CI support is consulted regarding need
   to update existing CITAs.
   3.12.3. Providing analytical studies or risk assessment products from the Defense Security
   Service (DSS) on foreign threats from Foreign Ownership, Control and Influenced (FOCI)
   risks or Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) cases.
   3.12.4. Supporting DIA and NASIC analysis of foreign need, intent, capability, targeting,
   and collection pertaining to CPI and critical components.
   3.12.5. Providing PMs, via TSN focal point, with DIA SCRM TAC assessments of critical
   components.
3.13. Intelligence Support. PMs should seek appropriate intelligence for Technology
Targeting Risk Assessments (TTRA) when requesting intelligence production. Center
Intelligence Officers or program intelligence representatives facilitate the PM in assessing threats
and developing countermeasures by providing the following:
   3.13.1. Forecasts of the military technology needs of threat countries and potential
   development areas that could impact program protection (CPI and critical component).
   3.13.2. Intelligence on the current state of foreign technologies contrasting the market
   forecast of competitive countries with U.S. technology efforts in each CPI.
   3.13.3. Predictive intelligence on foreign cyber capabilities and intent.
3.14. Reviews. Program protection requirements and measures should be reviewed for risk
mitigations during program and SETRs (see Figure 5.1). The following reviews (at a minimum)
provide the PM opportunities to confirm that the program has addressed the adequacy of the
comprehensive program protection approach:
   3.14.1. Alternative System Review (ASR)
   3.14.2. System Requirements Review (SRR)
   3.14.3. System Functional Review (SFR)

   3.14.4. Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
   3.14.5. Critical Design Review (CDR)
3.15. Contractual Considerations. Contractual provisions must be in place to support the
approved PPP. Solicitations, requirements documents, and contracts with industry must require
the protection of CPI and critical components outlined in the PPP and placed on contract via the
DD 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. (See DoDI 5200.44) PMs should
ensure that requirements documents require prime contractors and subcontractors, as applicable,
to:
   3.15.1. Support the PM’s identification and protection of CPI and critical components.
   Protection should be based on security requirements and selected countermeasures. See
   Chapter 5 of this document.
   3.15.2. Produce and use a Program Protection Implementation Plan (PPIP) or appropriate
   deliverable to document the contractor’s measures to protect CPI and critical components at
   their facilities and supplier locations consistent with the Government’s PPP.
   3.15.3. Properly identify, mark, and protect all controlled unclassified information. Comply
   with the provisions of DoDI 8582.01, Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD
   Information Systems, as applicable.
   3.15.4. Communicate program protection requirements to subcontractors who are also
   responsible for identifying, accessing, marking, handling, and protecting CPI or critical
   components.
   3.15.5. Assess the security practices of subcontractors or suppliers and continually monitor
   their compliance with protection measures. Contracts should include clauses to ensure
   software assurance and static and dynamic code reviews on software developed for delivery
   to the Government.
   3.15.6. Implement, and as appropriate require subcontractors to implement, supply chain risk
   management and information assurance best practices. This should include identifying
   potential suppliers of critical components and identifying processes to control access by
   foreign nationals to software, hardware, and associated classified and unclassified
   information used to integrate commercial technology. Additionally, the PM must ensure the
   implementation of processes to protect classified and controlled unclassified DoD
   information.
   3.15.7. Require counterfeit prevention processes and requirements for all levels of
   subcontractors. Include DFARS clause 252.246-7003, Notification of Potential Safety
   Issues, in contracts for critical components Ensure contractor and subcontractor reports of
   suspected or confirmed counterfeit items are entered into the Government-Industry Data
   Exchange Program (GIDEP) system, which will serve as the DoD central reporting
   repository.
   3.15.8. Allow Government personnel or designee access to prime contractor and
   subcontractor facilities to enable surveys, assessments, and inspections to verify the
   successful implementation of protection activities.

                         PROGRAM PROTECTION PROCEDURES

4.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the procedures to gather all the inputs and analysis
required as part of program protection. Figure 4.1 presents the seven suggested program
protection steps to follow which are detailed in this chapter. PMs may tailor these steps to meet
the program’s circumstances.

Figure 4.1. Program Protection Procedures.




4.2. Step 1: Identify Stakeholders and Conduct Initial Analysis. This step includes
identifying stakeholders and functional experts, gathering relevant program documentation,
bounding the system, evaluating the requirements, and performing an initial functional
decomposition. The PM identifies stakeholders and subject matter experts from the operational,
scientific, acquisition, logistics, sustainment, engineering, security, intelligence, and information
protection communities. Consider forming and chartering an Integrated Process Team, which
can be useful to the PM as a management approach. See Attachment 2 for scope of membership
and activities.
4.3. Step 2: Identify Critical Program Information (CPI) and Critical Components. The
PM must continually evaluate system security risks in relation to cost, schedule, and
performance. CPI and critical components (whether technology, components, or information)
must be identified to prioritize and manage system security risks. Helpful program
documentation, if available, includes, but is not limited to: Systems Requirements Document,
 26                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


Capability Development Document, system schematics such as Operational Activity Models,
Work Breakdown Structure, and Information Support Plan (ISP) (Operational View (OV)-5 and
associated activity models, if available).
   4.3.1. Conduct Criticality Analysis. IAW DoDI 5200.44, criticality analysis is an end-to-end
   functional decomposition performed to identify mission-critical functions and components.
   It includes identification of missions, a decomposition of each mission set into the functions
   to perform those missions, and the traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware
   components that implement those functions, protect those functions, or have unmitigated
   access to those functions. Criticality is assessed in terms of relative impact on the system’s
   ability to complete its mission if the component fails or is compromised. Criticality analysis
   determines:
      4.3.1.1. Mission criticality and prioritization of mission capability.
      4.3.1.2. Critical functions that support the prioritized mission capabilities and the
      prioritization of those functions.
      4.3.1.3. Critical components that support the prioritized critical functions. The list of all
      critical components in applicable systems is documented in the PPP.
   4.3.2. Accomplish CPI and Critical Component Identification Process. PMs should identify
   CPI and critical components early in the development, to include the Materiel Solution
   Analysis Phase. Technologies transitioned or inherited from another program should also be
   evaluated. Once initial analysis from Step 1 has been completed, system decomposition
   should be performed in order to apply the CPI Identification Survey and Decision Aid (See
   Attachment 8). The PM should determine which items will have the CPI Decision Aid
   applied to them. The system should be decomposed to the lowest possible level in order to
   identify potential CPI and critical components with sufficient granularity. Identifying CPI
   and critical components at the lowest sub-system or component level possible is a critical
   enabler of focusing countermeasures. How far a system is decomposed will vary based on
   the nature and complexity of the system. For example, a radar receiver group might be
   decomposed to specific device or part. In such a case, identifying the entire suite as potential
   CPI or critical components versus a piece part could have significant impact (cost and
   schedule) to the program in the application of countermeasures.
      4.3.2.1. ACAT PMs should use the CPI Identification Survey and Decision Aid found in
      Attachment 8 to quickly identify if a program has the potential for containing CPI.
      4.3.2.2. The PM should document in the PPP the list of critical functions and critical
      components identified during the criticality analysis. The PM should build the PPP for
      these components whether or not he or she determines the program has CPI. The level of
      decomposition will depend upon the maturity of the program, however it should complete
      prior to the Critical Design Review (CDR). See DoD PPP Outline and Guidance in the
      Defense Acquisition Guide (DAG) Chapter 13.
      4.3.2.3. The PM documents the methodology for identification of CPI, critical
      components, and mission critical functions in the PPP.
   4.3.3. Identify Inherited CPI. Inherited CPI is technology, components, or information not
   originating from or organic to the program. Review CPI and protection measures of any
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  27


   program or technology which is being incorporated into, interfaces with, or is a sub-system
   of the parent program. Inherited CPI protection measures can aid in the selection of
   appropriate CPI protection measures or to recommend changes in existing protection
   measures. The receiving PM is responsible for ensuring inherited CPI protective measures
   are adopted to meet horizontal protection requirements and protection methodology intent.
   Protection should be based upon its role in the inheriting system and its original role
   (horizontal protection). Also review CPI and/or protection measures for programs sharing
   like capabilities to ensure horizontal protection is maintained.
   4.3.4. Review ASDB for Similar CPI. The Acquisition Security Database (ASDB) is DoD’s
   tool for implementing horizontal protection. The ASDB is only used for CPI.
       4.3.4.1. Once CPI has been identified PMs should review ASDB for other programs’
       existing or similar CPI.
       4.3.4.2. PMs should review the ASDB at least once every three (3) years during the PPP
       review cycle or more often if there are changes in the program causing a review of CPI or
       critical components.
       4.3.4.3. PMs should check for the presence of unidentified inherited CPI.
       4.3.4.4. In cases where CPI for like programs exists outside the ASDB, review those
       programs for inherited CPI.
       4.3.4.5. Horizontal Protection Adjudication. If an inconsistency in classification or
       protection countermeasures exists for the program’s CPI or related CPI, the PMs should
       use the horizontal protection adjudication process to resolve or mitigate the risk.
           4.3.4.5.1. PMs should determine, based upon a comparative analysis of levels of
           protection, if countermeasures involving another program’s CPI will result in
           relatively equal protection afforded to the CPI by each program.
           4.3.4.5.2. If there are disagreements regarding classification of CPI and/or related
           information which cannot be resolved informally, formal Original Classification
           Authority challenging procedures should be followed for resolution.
           4.3.4.5.3. Horizontal protection adjudication should be performed at the lowest
           common level of authority for the programs involved. For example, disputes between
           programs with the same MDA should be resolved by that MDA. Disputes between
           AF programs with different MDAs should be resolved by the SAE. Disputes across
           Services should be resolved by Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,
           Technology, and Logistics, USD (AT&L), as noted below.
           4.3.4.5.4. After the horizontal protection process has been adjudicated, each of the
           programs should update their PPPs and the ASDB to record the results of the
           adjudication. This will likely include either updating (adding or modifying) the CPI
           list and/or updating the countermeasures that will be implemented to protect the CPI.
           If classification level of CPI changes based on horizontal protection adjudication
           process, ensure the SCG is updated to reflect the change.
NOTE: If USD (AT&L) becomes aware that there is a contradiction in the identification and/or
protection of CPI between two programs that are being executed by different Service
organizations, then USD (AT&L) will first inform the two programs of the issue and request that
 28                                                       AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


they work together to resolve the issue. If the Services cannot come to an agreement on the
resolution, the USD (AT&L) decision authority will adjudicate the issue and make the final
decision.
   4.3.5. Propose Candidate CPI and Critical Components Lists. The most fundamental
   decisions in the entire process are the CPI baseline and critical components determinations.
   These determinations should be approved by the PM and validated by the PEO prior to
   further PPP development in order to begin CPI and critical components protection
   immediately. The CPI and critical components determinations will be further validated by
   the MDA upon approval of the PPP (see Figure 4.1).
       4.3.5.1. Validate CPI and Critical Components List. The PM should approve the CPI
       and critical components lists, obtain PEO validation, then ensure entry of new CPI into
       the ASDB within 15 days of CPI determination. Ensure CPI and associated information
       is marked/classified IAW the appropriate SCG. Prior to ASDB entry, CPI will be
       evaluated for classification using the program’s SCG.
       4.3.5.2. Reassess the CPI and Critical Components Determination. CPI and critical
       components will be assessed at each milestone, modification, or as directed by the MDA
       or equivalent decision authority. In addition to all PPP updates for milestones, the PM
       should assess all modifications and configuration changes for impact to CPI and critical
       components and the PPP should be updated accordingly. Protection assessment results
       should be included as part of the PM’s configuration management process. For further
       guidance see Attachments 5 and 6.
4.4. Step 3: Identify Threats to CPI and Critical Components. A threat is anything that
impacts the ability to protect technology, information, and components from unintended use.
Threats to systems may result in loss or degradation of CPI or critical components. Threats are
not static, and the program must be diligently monitored for changes in threat. A program’s CPI
and critical components and critical functionality face many types of threats. A threat may also
arise from a natural event. Multiple resources should be used to develop a comprehensive
picture of the threat environment to include the probability of a threat occurring. Attachment 3
provides threat identification methodology, threat assessment options, and procedures. When a
threat has been identified, the PM should:
   4.4.1. Conduct Threat Analysis. During initial threat analysis events, the PM may not be
   fully informed by specific intelligence and should therefore focus on deciding what kinds of
   threats may exist and what type of intelligence will be required. After receiving specific
   intelligence, further threat analysis must occur. Identifying threats must be accomplished
   throughout the life cycle. Multiple threat analysis events should be planned.
   4.4.2. Implement Interim Mitigations. Interim mitigations or countermeasures should be
   implemented immediately for CPI and critical components.
   4.4.3. Request Threat Assessments.
       4.4.3.1. Contact the servicing AFOSI detachment to request a Counterintelligence Threat
       Assessment (CITA) on the program’s CPI list.
       4.4.3.2. For supply chain risk issues, contact the AFMC or AFSPC MAJCOM TSN focal
       point to request DIA SCRM TAC reports on the program’s critical components list, and
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    29


       for submitting RFIs on critical components. Reference Attachment 3. PMs should work
       through the Center Intelligence office to request additional intelligence support as needed
       to identify threats.
       4.4.3.3. PMs is required to request updated threat assessments for existing CPI and
       critical components every three years per DoDI O-5240.24.
   4.4.4. Map threats to each CPI and Critical Component. Conduct additional threat analysis
   events as new intelligence becomes available.
4.5. Step 4: Identify CPI and Critical Component Vulnerabilities. Identification of CPI
and critical components vulnerabilities should occur as an independent process. For efficiency
they can be sequenced to occur concurrently with threat identification. These vulnerabilities may
include aspects of the technology development environment, the systems design, or the methods
used to procure the component. Attack vectors should be determined based upon how the
system is vulnerable to threats. Attachment 4 provides detailed information on vulnerability
analysis methodology and procedures.
       4.5.1.1. Conduct Vulnerability Analysis.
       4.5.1.2. Document concept, technology, or system security vulnerabilities as well as
       perceived value to adversaries.
       4.5.1.3. Identify impacts to criticality of mission success in deployment.
       4.5.1.4. For systems with distinct electromagnetic or acoustic emissions, identify the
       susceptibility that an outside agency may be able to collect these emissions and the
       impact of such collection.
   4.5.2. Identify where CPI or Critical Components are vulnerable to mapped threats. This
   should be informed by likely adversarial attack vectors.
   4.5.3. Contractual Language. Contractual language should require contractors to assist in
   identifying CPI and critical components and produce a Program Protection Implementation
   Plan (PPIP) or other appropriate deliverable consistent with the Government’s PPP. If CPI is
   identified after contract award (e.g. during technology development in a laboratory effort),
   ensure a security survey is conducted within 90 days after CPI is identified and ensure the
   contract is amended to include the PPP requirement at the next contract update or within one
   year (whichever is sooner).
4.6. Step 5: Identify Risks to CPI and Critical Components. Compliance based protection
measures, potentially classified components, and critical infrastructure requirements must be
identified at the earliest time to be included in the comprehensive program protection scheme.
System security engineering methodology is critical to the development of systems that are
designed to address protection concerns. See Chapter 5 and Attachment 5 for further guidance to
accomplish the following activities:
   4.6.1. Conduct Risk Analysis. Determine where the interaction of threats and vulnerabilities
   creates risk.
       4.6.1.1. Assess the probability that an adversary can exploit the vulnerability.
       4.6.1.2. Assess the consequence to the system, mission, or personnel if an adversary
       successfully exploits the vulnerability.
 30                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


       4.6.1.3. Determine residual risk based on probability and consequence.
       4.6.1.4. Develop mitigations and countermeasures for all moderate or higher risks.
   4.6.2. Identify Potential Countermeasures. Nominate potential countermeasures based upon
   the perceived attack vectors identified during threat analysis and vulnerability analysis.
   4.6.3. Develop Protection Approaches. Assess countermeasure effectiveness without respect
   to cost.
   4.6.4. Conduct Cost Benefit Analysis. Estimate cost of countermeasures for cost/benefit
   analysis. Risk tolerance is also an important consideration during risk analysis.
   4.6.5. PM Selects Protection Approach. Develop final countermeasures for consideration
   and approval by the PM. Risk mitigations selected for implementation should include
   countermeasures that the program can use to protect against the highest priority attack
   vectors. Final countermeasures should be identified as a change to process documentation,
   system requirements, or other contractual document change (e.g. Statement of Work (SOW)).
   4.6.6. PMs should assess residual risk to each identified risk/vulnerability based upon the
   proposed countermeasure and perceived effectiveness.
4.7. Step 6: Build and Coordinate a Program Protection Plan. The program protection
work/decisions/outcomes will be captured in the PPP and associated annexes. Information
collection to finalize PPP development begins with the results of the criticality analysis and the
identification of CPI and critical components. Supporting documentation of the analysis and
decision-making processes is critical to acceptance of the plan by the approval authority.
Required attachments are determined by the nature of the program. Reference Attachment 7.
4.8. Step 7: Monitor Countermeasure Effectiveness and Report Compromises. The PM
should monitor the effectiveness of the program protection approach. Countermeasures can
eliminate or reduce the projected vulnerabilities and, within the parameters of risk management
principles, negate an adversary's ability to exploit any vulnerability. To ensure countermeasure
effectiveness, personnel with access to CPI and critical components must understand procedures
and methods to protect the CPI and critical components. If countermeasures are determined to
be less effective than required, then the countermeasures and/or risk assessment should be re-
examined. For further information see Attachment 6.
   4.8.1. Program Protection Surveys (PPSs). The PM is responsible for ensuring that a PPS is
   conducted on contractor and sub-contractor facilities supporting ACAT I and II programs
   containing CPI or critical components at least once during each integrated life cycle phase.
   See Attachment 6 of this document and DoD 5200.1-M. The PPS must be a contract
   requirement.
   4.8.2. CPI and Critical Components Reviews. PMs should assess CPI and critical
   components to confirm validity of the CPI and critical components determinations and
   related protection countermeasures. These reviews should address all of the above program
   protection process steps. These reviews should occur:
       4.8.2.1. Every three years.
       4.8.2.2. Upon receipt of updated threat assessments for existing CPI and critical
       components.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 31


     4.8.2.3. When there are significant changes in the configuration of the program.
     4.8.2.4. When monitoring identifies degradation in effectiveness of countermeasures.
  4.8.3. Updates to PPPs. The PM should review the PPP for currency at least once every
  three (3) years. This includes requesting updated threat assessments for the program’s CPI
  and critical components throughout the life cycle of the program and at each milestone.
  Sustainment programs should follow the same process identified in Section 4.8.2 for the
  review of CPI and critical components and the update to the PPP. Also, systems in
  Sustainment undergoing modifications should follow the same process for CPI and critical
  components identification and update the PPP to ensure protection of upgrades to the system.
     4.8.3.1. Countermeasures should be modified or terminated when no longer required or
     determined to be ineffective. Changes to CPI countermeasures should be reflected in the
     ASDB.
     4.8.3.2. PPP updates during the life cycle of the system, to include sustainment and at
     each milestone, should be coordinated with MAJCOM users to ensure synchronization
     with MAJCOM requirements documentation, funding, training, testing, certification,
     sustainment, installation security planning, and operational risk acceptance decisions
     prior to operational transition.
     4.8.3.3. The technical content and currency of the PPP should be validated before any
     portfolio transfer or transition to the operational and/or sustainment organization. CPI
     and critical components supporting artifacts should be included with the transition.
     4.8.3.4. Upon completing the PPP and threat assessment review, the PM should:
         4.8.3.4.1. Document the results of the PPP review confirming that recent threat
         assessments did not reveal any change in threat to the program’s CPI or critical
         components; or
         4.8.3.4.2. Update the PPP because there has been a change in the program’s CPI,
         critical components, and/or a change in the threat confirmed by the results of the
         threat assessments.
  4.8.4. Measure Countermeasure Effectiveness. Measures of effectiveness should be
  developed. The PM uses measures of effectiveness to monitor countermeasure performance
  and perform a reassessment of CPI and critical components protection measures.
  4.8.5. Report Compromises. Procedures for handling compromises should be developed and
  included in the PPP. The loss or theft of CPI or critical components presents a threat to the
  warfighter’s capability and DoD’s technological superiority. Reports of loss or theft ensure
  such incidents are properly investigated and the necessary actions are taken to negate or
  minimize the adverse effects and to preclude recurrence.
     4.8.5.1. Compromise. Any potential compromise of CPI or critical components is
     required to be immediately reported to the PM. The PM is required to provide written
     notification of any actual or potential compromise of US Government information
     designated as CPI (classified or unclassified) to the servicing CI and security officials
     IAW DoDD O-5240.02, Counterintelligence, DoDI 5240.04, Counterintelligence (CI)
     Investigations, DoDI 5200.39, DoD 5200.01 v1, Information Security, DoD 5220.22-M,
     National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and AFI 31-401,
32                                                       AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


     Information Security Program Management. In addition, the PM should review the
     ASDB to determine if there is a possible impact to other programs. The PM should
     inform the servicing intelligence and AFOSI detachment if other programs may be
     affected. AFOSI should review the ASDB to determine if there is a possible impact to
     other programs. The PM should take the following actions upon discovery of a
     compromised critical component:
        4.8.5.1.1. Protect the fact of a compromised critical component as CONFIDENTIAL
        information or at a higher classification if directed by the program Security
        Classification Guide.
        4.8.5.1.2. Retain possession of all compromised critical components.
        4.8.5.1.3. Notify the local AFOSI official not later than 72 hours after discovery.
        4.8.5.1.4. Contact the AFMC or AFSPC TSN focal point for potential mitigations.
        4.8.5.1.5. Notify the COMSEC Responsible Officer or COMSEC Account Manager
        (CAM) within 24 hours for incidents involving electronic communication of
        classified information and/or Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment,
        whether test, evaluation or operational use.
     4.8.5.2. Theft. Upon indication of theft of CPI, whether involving unclassified or
     classified, contractor proprietary, or Air Force/DoD data, PMs should notify the PEO
     with either proposed countermeasures and/or mitigation strategies or indicate a proposed
     acceptance of the threat risk and the rationale. PMs should present initial mitigation plan
     to the PEO within 30 days. If adequate countermeasures or mitigation strategies cannot
     be put in place or the risk is unacceptable, the PM should determine and document if
     protection of the CPI and critical components is still warranted for the program. This
     determination should include impact on other affected programs through horizontal
     analysis. If protection is no longer warranted and there is no impact to other programs,
     the PM should take action to end protection countermeasures in future program and
     contracting actions.
     4.8.5.3. Damage Assessments.
        4.8.5.3.1. Damage assessments are conducted by SAF/CIO A6 for DIB CS/IA
        Framework Agreement signatory companies only. Damage assessments for classified
        information are conducted by the Original Classification Authority (OCA). When CI
        authorities suspect or confirm the involvement of criminal(s), and/or foreign entity(s),
        including foreign intelligence service(s), in a compromise incident, the PM will
        provide notification of the incident to the PEO, the servicing Information Protection
        Office, the Original Classification Authority (OCA) for classified compromises, and
        the Designated Accrediting Authority.
        4.8.5.3.2. PMs will fully cooperate with the damage assessment process to include
        providing subject matter experts to assist in the evaluation of the incident’s impact
        and development of countermeasures.
        4.8.5.3.3. Within 30 days of the damage assessment report, the PM should provide
        the PEO a written response to the damage findings along with proposed
        countermeasures and/or revised mitigation strategies that nullify the advantages
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                            33


        gained by an adversary from the captured information, or propose acceptance of the
        threat risk and rationale.
     4.8.5.4. ASDB Updates. PMs will update the ASDB after each confirmed compromise
     of CPI.

                                            Chapter 5

            PROGRAM PROTECTION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE

5.1. Overview. Program protection may require systems security engineering or secure systems
design to control system vulnerabilities and contain risks through sound engineering principles.
These methods eliminate or reduce the vulnerability of Critical Program Information (CPI) or
critical components to loss or compromise, and include any method (e.g., anti-tamper techniques,
or information assurance) that effectively negates a foreign interest capability to exploit CPI
vulnerability. Reference MIL-HDBK 1785 for more on recommended systems security
activities. The secure systems designer:
   5.1.1. Identifies, designs, develops, and tests security features in Air Force weapons systems
   until protection is no longer required (e.g., the system is demilitarized, or the technology is
   approved for release to the public).
   5.1.2. Develops and implements systems engineering countermeasures to reduce
   vulnerabilities.
   5.1.3. Considers possible enemy capture of the system.
   5.1.4. Considers potential foreign involvement and defense exportability features so that the
   system is cost effectively designed and will facilitate security cooperation from international
   research, development, and acquisition through foreign military sales with partner nations.
   5.1.5. Is part of new developments (including off-the-shelf and non-developmental items)
   and modifications of existing systems to minimize the operational costs of protecting
   deployed systems.
5.2. Context of Program Protection within SE. In order to be cost-efficient and technically
effective, system security engineering must be integrated into the program’s systems engineering
approach. The PPP should describe the linkage between system security engineering and the
Systems Engineering Plan and describe how the system security design considerations will be
addressed. PMs must consider program protection throughout the system life cycle as part of
systems engineering to provide a comprehensive, iterative, systems engineering approach. The
systems engineer:
   5.2.1. Specifies, predicts, and evaluates the vulnerability of the system to security threats.
   5.2.2. Identifies and minimizes vulnerabilities to known or postulated threats.
   5.2.3. Characterizes security risks to the system in the operational environment.
   5.2.4. Develops risk mitigation approaches.
   5.2.5. Develops a comprehensive security risk management program.
   5.2.6. Translates mission needs and vulnerabilities into system security requirements for
   development, Test & Evaluation (T&E), manufacturing, verification, deployment, operations,
   support, training, and disposal.
   5.2.7. Reduces technical acquisition risks through early identification of security
   requirements and their associated costs and effectiveness.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  35


Figure 5.1. Program Protection in the Acquisition Life Cycle.




5.3. Program Protection in the Acquisition Life Cycle. The tasks detailed in this section
should be applicable throughout the system life cycle for any pre-Milestone A effort, new
acquisition program, upgrade, modification, resolution of deficiency, or technology refresh.
Activities can be specified for each of the phases leading up to a major program milestone. See
Figure 5.1.
   5.3.1. Material Solutions Analysis. System security engineering should be used in early
   concept development to evaluate mission threads, identify system functions, and analyze
   notional system architectures to identify mission critical functions. The Capstone Threat
   Assessment (CTA) is the authoritative threat document for pre-milestone acquisition
   activities.
       5.3.1.1. Development planning efforts should evaluate protection concepts.
       5.3.1.2. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) decision includes weighing the relative costs
       and benefits of implementing different system protection features.
       5.3.1.3. Technology Development Phase (or equivalent). Security activities during this
       phase are developed based on the System Threat Assessment Report (STAR) if available,
       Counterintelligence Threat Assessment (CITA), Capstone Threat Assessments (CTAs),
       other threat assessments as appropriate for the program, and the Acquisition Strategy (as
       it relates to international partnering and potential for foreign military sales). See
       Attachment 10 for specific program protection tasks that should be performed in the
       Technical Development phase.
       5.3.1.4. Designing in System Security. The system designer should analyze protection
       requirements for the system’s critical functions and components. Portions of the system
       may need to be re-designed to minimize compromising the system or its technologies.
36                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


     The PM should ensure the following program protection activities take place during the
     Technology Development Phase:
         5.3.1.4.1. Update or refine PPP from the previous phase.
         5.3.1.4.2. Define or refine system specifications.
         5.3.1.4.3. Update or refine the security vulnerability analysis.
         5.3.1.4.4. Identify product security requirements.
         5.3.1.4.5. Conduct cost benefit analysis and trade studies.
         5.3.1.4.6. Conduct systems security risk analysis and studies.
         5.3.1.4.7. Update or refine certification and accreditation requirements. (Reference
         AFI 33-210, DoDI 8510.01)
     5.3.1.5. Allocating System Security Requirements. The Government and contractor
     should both directly support the allocation of system security requirements into program
     documentation and activities in preparation for the Milestone B Decision. PMs should
     ensure system security requirements are contained in:
         5.3.1.5.1. Request for Proposal (RFP) - security requirements for the contractor.
         5.3.1.5.2. Statement of Objective (SOO), SOW, System Requirements Document
         (SRD), or system specification as appropriate.
         5.3.1.5.3. Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL).
         5.3.1.5.4. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification.
         5.3.1.5.5. Applicable Data Item Descriptions (DID).
         5.3.1.5.6. Source Selection Planning.
         5.3.1.5.7. Wartime Reserve Modes (WARM).                 For systems with distinct
         electromagnetic or acoustic emissions, evaluate the potential for WARM. WARM
         are characteristics and operating procedures of sensors, communications, navigation
         aids, threat recognition, weapons, and countermeasures systems that will contribute to
         military effectiveness if unknown to or misunderstood by opposing commanders
         before they are used, but could be exploited or neutralized if known in advance.
         5.3.1.5.8. Planning Instruments.
            5.3.1.5.8.1. Information Assurance Risk Analysis.
            5.3.1.5.8.2. Communication Security (COMSEC) Equipment Plans.
            5.3.1.5.8.3. Security Classification Guide.
            5.3.1.5.8.4. Security System Concepts.
            5.3.1.5.8.5. Demilitarization and Disposal Plan.
  5.3.2. Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. The PM should continue the
  integration of system security design/countermeasure features based on the work done in the
  previous phase.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   37


     5.3.2.1. Designing in System Security. The PM should ensure the steps followed in 5.3.1
     of this document are followed as applicable during the Engineering and Manufacturing
     Development Phase.
     5.3.2.2. Allocating System Security Requirements. The Government and contractor
     should both directly support the allocation of system security requirements into program
     documentation and activities in preparation for the Milestone C Decision. PMs should
     ensure system security requirements are updated and included in the documents cited in
     5.3.1.5. of this document.
     5.3.2.3. Performing or Updating Key Program Protection Tasks. If not previously
     accomplished, or if the program is undergoing modification or other changes in design,
     implementation, or operation, PMs should reference Attachment 10 for specific program
     protection tasks that should be performed in the Engineering and Manufacturing
     Development phase.
  5.3.3. Production & Deployment Phase. Production-related security will usually be the
  responsibility of the government’s industry partners. For industry security procedures, see
  DoD 5220.22-M. The following is a list of activities required for program protection during
  this phase:
     5.3.3.1. Update or refine system/subsystems interface specifications, vulnerability
     analysis, system architecture, and threat analysis.
     5.3.3.2. Update or refine systems security concepts.
     5.3.3.3. Finalize product security requirements and include in the RFP for this phase.
     5.3.3.4. Include system security design characteristics in product configuration and
     document in the product specifications.
     5.3.3.5. Performing or Updating Key Program Protection Tasks. If not previously
     accomplished, or if the program is undergoing modification or other changes in design,
     implementation, or operation, PMs should reference Attachment 10 for specific program
     protection tasks that should be performed in the Production and Deployment phase.
  5.3.4. Operations & Support Phase. In the event of modifications the PM should ensure
  security design elements are maintained and determine if the modifications require additional
  design and/or countermeasures. The PPP should, as warranted, be updated to reflect
  modifications. The PM should manage ACAT-designated system modifications as
  acquisition efforts with milestones IAW AFI 63-131.
     5.3.4.1. Secure system design documentation, plans, and analyses for sustainment are
     updated for system modifications or upgrades and changes in threat.
     5.3.4.2. If the CPI or critical components no longer need protection, document the
     rationale for this in an updated PPP. Otherwise protect the system from losing its
     military advantages and from incorporating malicious or counterfeit content until system
     demilitarization.
     5.3.4.3. Incorporate processes for the continual monitoring on the effectiveness of
     implemented security controls and safeguards to ensure the desired level of protection is
     being provided.
 38                                                       AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


       5.3.4.4. Performing or Updating Key Program Protection Tasks. If not previously
       accomplished, or if the program is undergoing modification or other changes in design,
       implementation, or operation, PMs should reference Attachment 10 for specific program
       protection tasks that should be performed in the Operations and Support phase.
       5.3.4.5. PM must manage supply chain risk during the operational phase by supporting
       the incident reporting processes.
   5.3.5. Demilitarization. Ensure the security measures outlined in the Demilitarization and
   Disposal Plan are followed as well as any other required safeguards for restricted technology
   (e.g. ITAR, export controlled) designated either to be placed in storage or for disposal. PM
   should ensure PPP is provided to Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group or
   Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office as applicable. (Reference DoD 4160.21-M,
   Defense Materiel Disposition Manual).
   5.3.6. Testing Across Acquisition Life Cycle Phases. System security requirements and
   countermeasures should be integrated into the program’s T&E activities. Systems and
   facilities should be formally tested, evaluated, and certified as to the effectiveness of the
   system’s information and physical security. Security system training plans should be
   prepared and implemented. Operational system security engineering support activities
   should be initiated. The following should be considered during the testing phase:
       5.3.6.1. Information Assurance (IA) Test, Certification, and Accreditation Processes.
       Systems and facilities should be formally tested, evaluated, and certified as to the
       effectiveness of the system’s information and physical security. The PM should develop
       an IA strategy and IA test plans that are fully integrated into the other T&E activities of
       the program. System security requirements, assessment methods (i.e., analysis,
       inspection, demonstration, test, and evaluation), and deficiency reporting must be
       described in the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). The accreditation process
       should use a common risk management methodology. Reference AFI 99-103,
       Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and
       Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP).
       5.3.6.2. Electronic security/emission control (EMSEC, including TEMPEST).
       Especially during testing, the PM must ensure the selective and controlled use of any
       distinct electromagnetic or acoustic emissions to deny unauthorized persons information
       of value. WARM must not be used if it is incorporated into the system.
       5.3.6.3. Test results from Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test
       and Evaluation (OT&E), and IA testing should be reviewed to ascertain whether desired
       system security requirements have been achieved.
       5.3.6.4. Clear guidance via the PPP will initiate protection efforts throughout T&E. The
       PM must coordinate DT&E, OT&E, live-fire (LFT&E), family-of-systems
       interoperability, information assurance, and modeling and simulation (M&S) testing with
       the user and the appropriate T&E community to ensure CPI and critical components are
       protected and remain uncompromised during testing. See Chapter 7 of DoD 5200.1-M.
5.4. Threats and Vulnerabilities. PMs should assess their program(s) for security threats and
vulnerabilities to the program’s CPI and critical components as early as possible (before
Milestone A) and throughout the life cycle of the program to reduce the likelihood of damage,
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    39


compromise, or destruction to the system (Steps 3 and 4 of the PPP procedures in Chapter 4).
Specifically, PMs should:
   5.4.1. Identify CPI and critical components and map their threats and vulnerabilities. Tailor
   individual security disciplines to program development efforts as cost-effectively as possible.
   5.4.2. Map threats that can be neutralized or minimized through system design and
   countermeasures.
   5.4.3. Identify necessary actions to minimize or contain system or component vulnerabilities.
   5.4.4. Prioritize based upon the consequences if CPI or critical components are lost or
   compromised. Factors to consider include the impact on combat effectiveness, combat-
   effective lifetime, and the costs associated with any modifications required to compensate for
   loss.
   5.4.5. Optimize life cycle security costs, while improving overall survivability of the system
   or component.
5.5. Protection Requirements. PMs must respond to protection requirements generated in an
evolving threat environment throughout the life cycle of the system. The operational and support
MAJCOMs, field operating agencies, and supporting security disciplines can provide guidance
and assistance as follows:
   5.5.1. Preparing Systems Security Concepts (SSC) and Protection Level designations.
   5.5.2. Including security requirements in the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the
   Capabilities Development Document (CDD), the Capabilities Production Document (CPD),
   as well as in the AF Form 1067 (Modification Proposal), Problem Statements, and other
   requirements documentation.
   5.5.3. Coordinating command or agency security requirements for systems scheduled to
   undergo depot maintenance.
   5.5.4. Establishing program protection support to ensure security for systems undergoing
   maintenance or modification.
   5.5.5. Developing security countermeasures based on threat analyses.
   5.5.6. Coordinating with other MAJCOMs and agencies to ensure adequate, continual
   security arrangements exist.
   5.5.7. Assessing the security impact of change proposals, deviations, and waivers through
   the system life cycle.
   5.5.8. Assisting in security planning.

Terms
Agility—Nimbleness and adaptability; enabled by dynamic, reconfigurable architectures such as
internet protocol hopping at the network layer.
Anti-Tamper (AT)—Anti-Tamper is defined as the systems engineering activities intended to
prevent and/or delay exploitation of Resident CPI in U.S. weapon systems.
Center Intelligence Office—The singular focal point at each center specifically dedicated to
supporting research, development, test, evaluation, and sustainment activities with analytical
services and intelligence products and information.
Compromise—The unauthorized access to or inadvertent disclosure, destruction, transfer,
alteration, or loss of CPI or critical components. The release of classified CPI to a person who
does not have a need to know or does not meet the requirements for access to classified (i.e. a
valid security clearance). A compromise must be assumed when CPI or critical components is
found not protected as stated in the PPP or when the network on which CPI or critical
components is connected to was compromised. Further, a compromise must be assumed when
CPI or critical components is found with any piece-part or code missing, is suspected of having
malicious code inserted, is altered in any way, or shows signs of tamper.
Counterfeit Materiel—Materiel whose identity or               characteristics   were   deliberately
misrepresented, falsified, or illegally altered.
Counterintelligence Support Plan (CISP)—The CISP is a formally coordinated action plan for
CI support to protect research and technology at specific DoD research, development, test, and
evaluation facilities and acquisition programs. The plan addresses key aspects of the installation,
the activity or program, and the nature of the CI activities to be employed. A separate plan may
be prepared for each DoD contractor or academic institution where CPI is involved.
Critical Asset Risk Management—The identification, assessment, protection, and real-time
monitoring of cyber and physical mission critical infrastructures essential to the execution of the
National Military Strategy.
Critical Component—A component which is or contains ICT including hardware, software, and
firmware, whether custom, commercial, or otherwise developed, and which delivers or protects
mission critical functionality of a system or which, because of the system’s design, may
introduce vulnerability to the mission critical functions of a system.
Critical Program Information (CPI)—(Per DoDI 5200.39). Elements or components of a
program that, if compromised, could cause significant degradation in mission effectiveness;
shorten the expected combat-effective life of the system; reduce technological advantage;
 48                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


significantly alter program direction; or enable an adversary to defeat, counter, copy, or reverse
engineer the technology or capability. CPI includes:
Information about applications, capabilities, processes, and end—items;
1.     Components critical to a military system or network mission effectiveness; and
2.     Technology that would reduce the US technological advantage if under foreign control.
Criticality Analysis—An end-to-end functional decomposition performed by Systems Engineers
to identify mission critical functions and components. It includes identification of system
missions, decomposition into the functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions. Criticality is
assessed in terms of the impact of function or component failure on the ability of the component
to complete the system missions(s).
Horizontal Protection—Common security countermeasures for protecting similar technologies
used by more than one program or technology project. It may extend across military
components. Horizontal protection ensures cost-effective application of technology protection
efforts.
Information and Communications Technology (ICT)— Includes all categories of ubiquitous
technology used for the gathering, storing, transmitting, retrieving, or processing of information
(e.g., microelectronics, printed circuit boards, computing systems, software, signal processors,
mobile telephony, satellite communications, and networks). ICT is not limited to, information
technology (IT) as defined in section 11101 of title 40, U.S.C. (Reference (n)). Rather, this term
reflects the convergence of IT and communications.
Information Technology—Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment
that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control,
display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the
executive agency. IT includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar
procedures, services (including support services), and related resources, including National
Security Systems (NSS). It does not include any equipment that is acquired by a federal
contractor incidental to a federal contract.
Inherited CPI—CPI from other acquisition programs, subsystems, or projects that are being
incorporated or implemented into another program.
Loss—A loss of CPI or critical components has occurred when it cannot be accounted for or
physically located.
Mission Assurance—An integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis, production,
verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution processes performed
over the life cycle of a program by which an operator/user determines that there is an acceptable
level of risk to employment of a system or end item to deliver an intended capability in an
intended environment. The objective of the assurance process is to identify and mitigate design,
production, and test deficiencies that could impact mission success.
Mission Critical Function—Any function of which the compromise would degrade the system
effectiveness in achieving the core mission for which it was designed.
Organic CPI— CPI initiated with the program, subsystem, or project.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                       49


Platform IT (PIT)—A special purpose system which employs computing resources (i.e.,
hardware, firmware, and optionally software) that are physically embedded in, dedicated to, or
essential in real time to the mission performance. It only performs (i.e., is dedicated to) the
information processing assigned to it by its hosting special purpose system (this is not for core
services). Examples include, but are not limited to: SCADA type systems, weapons, training
simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration equipment, equipment used in
the research and development of weapons systems, medical technologies, transport vehicles,
buildings, and utility distribution systems, such as water and electric.A critical component could
be a subset of PIT components.
Program Protection Plan (PPP)—The principal document that identifies a system’s critical
program elements (CPI and critical components), threats, and vulnerabilities throughout the
system’s life cycle. Program Protection is a comprehensive effort that encompasses all security,
technology transfer, intelligence, and counterintelligence processes through the integration of
embedded system security processes, security manpower, equipment, and facilities.
Resident CPI—(Previously known Critical Technologies) CPI resident in the weapon system,
including training and maintenance systems.
Resilience—The ability to avoid, survive, and recover from disruption. Disruption can be either
a sudden or a sustained event and may be natural or manmade (e.g., internal failure or external
attack). Resilience can be enabled by redundancy, diversity, and distributed functionality which
allow systems to repel, absorb, and/or recover from attacks. Resilience can be enhanced through
hardening, reduction of attack surfaces, critical mission segregation, and attack containment.
System survivability can be enhanced by autonomous compromise detection and repair (self
healing) and adaptation to and evolution from changing environments and threats.
Risk—A measure of future uncertainties in achieving program performance goals within defined
cost and schedule constraints. It has three components: a future root cause, a likelihood assessed
at the present time of that future root cause occurring, and the consequence of that future
occurrence.
Software Assurance—The level of confidence that software functions as intended and is free of
vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally designed or inserted as part of the software
throughout the lifecycle.
Supply Chain Risk—The risk that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted
function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution,
installation, operation, or maintenance of a system so as to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise
degrade the function, use, or operation of such system.
Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)—A systematic process for managing supply chain
risk by identifying susceptibilities, vulnerabilities and threats throughout DoD’s “supply chain”
and developing of mitigation strategies to combat those threats whether presented by the
supplier, the supplied product and its subcomponents, or the supply chain (e.g., initial
production, packaging, handling, storage, transport, mission operation, and disposal).
Suspect Counterfeit Materiel—Materiel, items, or products in which there is an indication by
visual inspection, testing, or other information that it may meet the definition of counterfeit
materiel provided herein.
 50                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


Systems Security Engineering (SSE)—An element of system engineering that applies scientific
and engineering principles to identify security vulnerabilities and minimize or contain risks
associated with these vulnerabilities.
Theft—The unauthorized access of CPI. Upon indication of theft of CPI, whether involving
unclassified or classified, contractor proprietary, or Air Force/DoD data, PMs must notify the
MDA with either proposed countermeasures and/or mitigation strategies that nullify the
advantage(s) gained by the adversary, or indicate a proposed acceptance of the threat risk and the
rationale.
Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN)—A DoD strategy and set of concepts to minimize the
risk that DoD’s warfighting capability will be impaired due to vulnerabilities in system design or
sabotage or subversion of a system’s critical functions or critical components by foreign
intelligence, terrorists, or other hostile elements.
Vulnerability—The characteristics of a system that causes it to suffer a definite degradation
(loss or reduction of capability to perform its designated mission) as a result of having been
subjected to a certain (defined) level of effects in an unnatural (man-made) hostile environment.
Vulnerability is considered a subset of survivability. Vulnerability in an information system is a
weakness in system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be
exploited.

              THREAT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES

A3.1. Threat analysis and vulnerability analysis may be accomplished concurrently. These
analyses establish the PM’s risk assessments and resulting priorities.
A3.2. Developing a comprehensive threat picture involves evaluating all threats both natural and
manmade. Adversary threats should be evaluated across the spectrum of potential adversary
types (i.e. international terrorists, domestic terrorists, foreign intelligence, criminals, insider
threat). As the system or project develops and moves toward operational status, evaluation
should include proposed operating locations.
A3.3. Evaluating the full spectrum of hostile adversarial threats begins with collecting threat
assessments from multiple disciplines. These assessments should include an analysis of the
threat likelihood with the initial report when possible. Foreign collection and the adversary’s
technical capability should be addressed, preferably at the national level when applicable. For
example, indicators of a high-likelihood threat by a foreign interest would include:
   A3.3.1. A foreign interest with a confirmed or assessed requirement for acquiring program
   information.
   A3.3.2. A foreign interest with the capability to acquire such information.
   A3.3.3. Indications of probable sources and methods that might be employed to satisfy a
   collection requirement based on confirmed or assessed identification of foreign collection
   requirements.
A3.4. Examples of threat assessments include:
   A3.4.1. Non-nuclear postulated threat.
   A3.4.2. Nuclear Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA).
   A3.4.3. Intelligence threat assessment through the servicing intelligence organization.
   A3.4.4. Counterintelligence Threat Assessment (CITA) through AFOSI.
   A3.4.5. DIA SCRM Threat Analysis Center (TAC) Reports.
   A3.4.6. System Threat Assessment Report (STAR).
   A3.4.7. System Threat Assessment (STA).
   A3.4.8. Applicable Capestone Threat Assessment.
A3.5. Threats may also include natural occurrences like weather, earthquakes, and fire.
A3.6. The potential threats identified are mapped to the CPI and critical components to include
the likelihood of the threat occurring. The mapping process involves linking the CPI and critical
components to potential threats and tactics that may be employed. Vulnerability to the threats is
assessed separately. As an example of likelihood, evaluate if the group posing a threat has or is
projected to have the capability to affect the CPI and critical components.
A3.7. After mapping the CPI and critical components, some gaps in threat information may
become evident, requiring additional or more detailed threat assessments.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     55


A3.8. Threats are not static and require routine revalidation and/or updates to threat assessments.
Potential changes in the operational threat should be reviewed as they occur using the PPP
process.
A3.9. Resources for Threat Analysis. AFOSI and DIA’s SCRM TAC can provide the program
with threat analyses. See DoDI O-5240.24 for CI support to the protection of CPI and critical
components.
A3.10. AFOSI provides CI support to defense technology and acquisition programs and
personnel. Through these efforts, the CI specialist works closely with the PM to monitor and
track supported CPI and critical components and technologies identified by the PM during the
life cycle process.
A3.11. PMs should request counterintelligence threat assessments from their servicing TSN
Focal Point or CI specialist.
A3.12. Intelligence assessments are requested via the Community On-Line Intelligence System
for End Users and Managers (COLISEUM).
A3.13. Use the list of questions provided in Table A3.1 as a guide to prepare the threat
assessment request.

                                VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

A4.1. Threat analysis and vulnerability analysis may be accomplished concurrently. These
analyses are utilized to establish the PM’s risk assessments and resulting priorities.
Vulnerabilities are potentially exploitable areas or situations that can be used by an adversary to
degrade, destroy, or collect information about CPI and critical components. Vulnerabilities may
occur in many forms including physical, technological, or procedural.
A4.2. Identifying the vulnerabilities of designated CPI and critical components includes
evaluating the weakness, potential consequences if exploited, and existing countermeasures.
A4.3. For each CPI or critical component, the PM should put the vulnerabilities in a priority
sequence order from highest (most severe consequences if exploited) to lowest. For critical
components, the criticality analysis process described in Chapter 4 establishes this priority order.
A4.4. Resources for risk analysis. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, provides a useful discussion
of risk assessment methodology. The Defense Acquisition Guide (DAG) chapter on program
protection (Chapter 13) provides guidance and approaches to identifying vulnerabilities. DoD
5205.02-M, DoD OPSEC Manual, provides detailed guidance on risk assessment methodology
for critical information. A4.5. Some additional factors to be considered are:
   A4.4.1. How the CPI and critical components are stored, maintained, or transmitted (e.g.,
   electronic media, blueprints, training materials, facsimile, or modem).
   A4.4.2. How the CPI and critical components are used (e.g., bench testing or field testing).
   A4.4.3. What emanations, exploitable signals, or signatures are generated by or reveal the
   CPI/ critical components (e.g., telemetry, acoustic, or radiant energy).
   A4.4.4. Where the CPI and critical components are physically located during development
   (e.g., program office, test site, contractor, or vendor) and fielding (e.g. engine bay, or
   cockpit).
   A4.4.5. What types of OPSEC indicators or observables are generated by program or system
   functions, actions, and operations involving CPI or critical components.

 RISK MANAGEMENT AND COUNTERMEASURE SELECTION METHODOLOGY

A5.1. Risk management of CPI and critical components should be performed in a manner
consistent with accepted risk management practices as detailed in the Risk Management Guide
for DoD Acquisition, 6th Edition, Aug 2006. The PM should use the 5x5 risk matrix to weigh the
likelihood and consequence of each risk in determining the appropriate risk mitigation approach.
The PM should consider the entire national investment, including the future investment needed
to address compromised CPI or critical components. At Milestone B or PDR (whichever comes
first), the MDA approves the PM’s baseline CPI list and associated protections.
A5.2. Once the risk management plan has been developed, the PM documents risk management
intent in the PPP, identifying the risk acceptance levels and the mitigation plan.
A5.3. Countermeasures are applied to mitigate or eliminate the projected vulnerabilities
negating an adversary's ability to exploit vulnerability. Comprehensive Courses of Action
(CCAs) with countermeasures are developed for each CPI or critical component showing a
baseline of where protection is today (current countermeasures) and projected effectiveness with
additional countermeasures. Countermeasures can vary from technical (e.g. design or
implementation) to procedural (e.g. T&E of CPI and critical components elements, additional
physical security) to procurement (e.g. “blind buys”). Cost should be presented in relation to
effectiveness and should be time or event phased.
A5.4. COAs selected may include an incremental implementation beginning with no cost or low
cost (i.e. procedural) and moving toward the final COA implementation to meet the acceptable
risk as funding is established or the project matures to a point where implementation is possible.
The COA selected (with countermeasures) is documented in the PPP.
A5.5. The PPP Outline and Guidance establishes specific questions and criteria that should be
addressed for general countermeasures and for specific areas of interest including Anti-Tamper,
Information Assurance, Software Assurance, Supply Chain Risk Management, and System
Security Engineering. Some additional questions to consider include:
   A5.5.1. Why were these specific countermeasures selected?
   A5.5.2. Which specific vulnerabilities do they remedy?
   A5.5.3. When and how will they be implemented or increased?
   A5.5.4. When and how will they be terminated or reduced?
   A5.5.5. How much are they expected to cost?

         MONITORING CPI AND CRITICAL COMPONENTS PROTECTION

A6.1. General. The implementation and monitoring of countermeasures must be addressed in
the PPP for each individual CPI or critical components. If countermeasures are determined to be
inadequate in satisfying the Program Manager risk tolerance level, then the PPP process should
be revised to address those situations or inadequacies. To ensure countermeasure effectiveness
PMs should implement a training program detailing the efforts, procedures, and methods used to
protect CPI and critical components.
A6.2. Program Protection Survey (PPS). IAW DoD 5200.1-M, the PPS provides the PM with
information about the effectiveness of the security applied to the program. At least one PPS
should be conducted on ACAT I and ACAT II acquisition programs containing CPI or critical
components during each phase of the acquisition cycle. Use the list of facilities handling CPI
and critical components and the PPP to plan and conduct a PPS. The PPS should be the PM’s
primary tool to evaluate and validate the PPP with the objective to:
   A6.2.1. Assess the overall effectiveness of the PPP during a given phase.
   A6.2.2. Provide specific indicators of possible losses of CPI and critical components.
   A6.2.3. Provide specific information on how the loss of CPI and critical components could
   occur.
   A6.2.4. Provide information to update the PPP for the remaining phases.
       A6.2.4.1. Identify potential critical infrastructure vulnerabilities to determine how to
       mitigate them.
A6.3. PPS Purpose. The PPS is used to assess the effectiveness of the established program
protection following PPP approval and implementation. Based on the results of the survey, the
PM may continue the PPP as written, or refocus resources to eliminate any security shortfalls.
   A6.3.1. The PM determines if the previously identified CPI and critical components received
   adequate protection during a given phase. Focus on specific threats and countermeasures.
   A6.3.2. The PM should limit the survey to determine the effectiveness of the protection and
   countermeasures planned and implemented at a specific facility to protect the CPI or critical
   components of a selected program. The survey methodology is to reproduce an adversary’s
   approach to the program being assessed, not to assess compliance with security procedures.
   A6.3.3. A written report should be provided to the PM addressing, as a minimum:
       A6.3.3.1. Effectiveness of the mitigations used for the program’s CPI and critical
       components.
       A6.3.3.2. Recommendations to improve protection measures to eliminate or reduce
       vulnerabilities.
   A6.3.4. The PPS should not be used as an inspection and should not be graded. To obtain
   accurate information and be a successful tool, the team conducting the survey depends on
   positive cooperation and assistance from the program management organization and the
   facility being surveyed.
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    61


   A6.3.5. The PPS report should be provided only to the PM. Any further distribution should
   be done only with PM approval. PMs should retain official file copies of each survey
   conducted. Along with the PPS report, the PPS team chief should provide lessons learned to
   the PM discussing specific areas of PPP strengths and weaknesses (including details such as
   actual locations, personnel names, and other program identifying information which are not
   included in the report). The PPS report should:
      A6.3.5.1. Be correlated to common trends and/or problems in the technology or
      acquisition community.
      A6.3.5.2. Concentrate on generic problems with resources, facilities, and/or training.
      A6.3.5.3. NOT be conducted at contractor-owned or operated locations unless the
      provisions of the contract authorize compliance reviews.
      A6.3.5.4. Should be coordinated with the servicing government security oversight office.
A6.4. Additional Surveys.
   A6.4.1. Security Surveys.
      A6.4.1.1. The purpose of initial and follow-on surveys is to evaluate the adequacy of
      additional security requirements outlined in the contract and PPP. The PPS is the tool
      used to conduct the surveys. Other inspection results, such as those conducted by DSS or
      Inspector General, may be utilized during the PPS, but will not replace the PPS.
      A6.4.1.2. Security surveys must be cost-effective. Do not conduct surveys where there
      are other means of evaluating security. Where security requirements are minimal, the
      PM may authorize the contractor to perform a survey. In these cases, the contractor
      should provide written certification to the PM of security at the facility.
      A6.4.1.3. Pre-award Surveys. Pre-award surveys should be used to:
          A6.4.1.3.1. Ensure the contractor can meet the requirements identified in the
          solicitation.
          A6.4.1.3.2. Determine whether the contractor has satisfied the requirements by
          participating in the Industrial Security Program or some other security program.
          A6.4.1.3.3. Evaluate the contractor's security plan(s) and physical security measures.
          A6.4.1.3.4. If the survey identifies problems in the contractor's program, recommend
          contract amendments to the contract administration office.
      A6.4.1.4. An initial survey should be conducted not later than 90 days after the contract
      is awarded or CPI is identified, and at 2-year intervals thereafter. PMs may vary the 2-
      year survey cycle if additional surveys are not cost-effective, or if there is a need for
      more frequent surveys.
      A6.4.1.5. The contractor and contract administration office should be notified in advance
      of a proposed survey. However, if security is in question no-notice surveys may be used.
      A6.4.1.6. Security surveys should be addressed to the requesting PM with informational
      copies to the operational command(s). A copy of the most recent survey should be kept
      in the security office supporting the program.
62                                                       AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


     A6.4.1.7. Security specialists should evaluate corrections that the contractor proposes. If
     corrective action seems inappropriate, the program office and contracting officer should
     recommend further action.
     A6.4.1.8. The PM should notify the cognizant DSS office of Industrial Security of
     proposed surveys at cleared contractor facilities which fall under the Industrial Security
     Program. Where the protection of classified CPI will be a subject of the survey, the
     cognizant DSS office should be requested to participate as a member of the survey team.

              PROGRAM PROTECTION PLAN (PPP) DOCUMENTATION

A7.1. Overview. PPPs are Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM) documents that are
reviewed and coordinated by appropriate stakeholders. The PPP identifies elements of the
program, classified and unclassified, which require protection to prevent unauthorized disclosure
or inadvertent transfer of Resident CPI or information. The PPP is a risk-based, living plan that
captures the program’s CPI, critical components, threats, vulnerabilities, countermeasures, cost,
and risk. Development of the PPP begins upon initial identification of CPI or critical
components and is updated throughout the life cycle of the program. It is the program’s primary
document to protect CPI and critical components from unauthorized access, inadvertent
disclosure, or compromise. Reference DoDI 5200.39, DoDI 5200.44, and the Defense
Acquisition Guide (DAG) Chapter 13 on program protection, which also has a link to the OSD
PPP Outline and Guidance.
   A7.1.1. PPPs for ACAT Programs. A PPP is required for all ACAT programs regardless of
   CPI determination. The PPP should be developed in accordance with the OSD format found
   on the DAG website. The PPP is approved by the MDA. The MDA may tailor the contents
   of the PPP to meet individual program needs.
   A7.1.2. PPPs for Other Applicable Programs. All new and legacy systems must address
   mission critical functions and components requiring risk management to protect capabilities.
   This includes AFPD 10-9 legacy systems undergoing any modification IAW AFI 63-131.
   PMs perform protection planning IAW DoDI 5000.02, AFI 63-101/20-101, and using this
   pamphlet for guidance. The approval authority may tailor the PPP contents or approval
   process for all ACAT III programs.
       A7.1.2.1. Technology Projects. The PM for a technology project requiring a formal
       Technology Transition Plan (TTP) must document the results of the CPI identification
       process and develop a PPP when CPI exists. If the CPI is protected using Anti-Tamper
       as a protective countermeasure and/or has Anti-Tamper protections, the approved AT
       plan should also be provided to the Transition Agent as a classified annex to the PPP.
A7.2. PPP Documentation Requirements and Related Functional Considerations. PMs
should review other documentation and functions that are integral to the acquisition process.
They may need to include or reference them in the PPP. The following should be included as
appendices as applicable:
   A7.2.1. Anti-Tamper (AT) Plan. Annex to PPP.
   A7.2.2. Counter Intelligence Support Plan (CISP). Annex to PPP.
   A7.2.3. Acquisition Information Assurance Strategy (IAS). Annex to PPP.
   A7.2.4. Security Classification Guide (SCG). Annex to PPP.
   A7.2.5. Criticality Analysis (CA). Annex to PPP.
   A7.2.6. System Engineering Plan (SEP). The SEP is a top-level management document that
   describes system engineering program tasks including secure system design. Designing in
   protection countermeasures is the objective of secure system design during protection
64                                                        AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


  planning efforts. Secure system design protections include anti-tamper and information
  assurance countermeasures.
  A7.2.7. Operations Security (OPSEC) Plan. OPSEC needs to be integrated into all
  technology, acquisition, and sustainment efforts (including testing). When a program has
  critical information, the PM must ensure OPSEC countermeasures are applied throughout the
  life cycle. An OPSEC plan is part of the countermeasures in the PPP. See AFI 10-701.
  A7.2.8. System Security Concept (SSC)/System Security Standard (SSS). The operating
  command may provide enabling and operating concepts for how the system will be secured.
  This can provide the PM with additional security insights for the protection approach and
  countermeasure selection. See DoD 5200.1-M, chapter 7 and appendix 1, and AFI 31-101.
     A7.2.8.1. The security concept is developed by evaluating projected system threats and
     vulnerabilities to assess the associated risk. System critical characteristics and sensitivity
     levels to mission capability should be correlated with the national security information
     categories, intelligence indicators, trusted computer system evaluation criteria, system
     operating modes, essential communication nodes, physical security criteria, OPSEC, and
     emissions security. The security concept evolves as the system matures to include
     projected security requirements such as protection levels or critical asset risk
     management and the associated manpower, facilities, and critical infrastructure nodes
     needed for operation.
     A7.2.8.2. The SSC or SSS enables seamless security when transitioning the system to the
     operational command.         In particular, identification of required resources and
     identification of classified material with Information Security protection requirements
     should be addressed to ensure resources are available when needed.
  A7.2.9. Special Security Agreement (SSA)/National Interest Determination (NID). SSAs
  and NIDs are related to work performed for the US by companies under Foreign Ownership,
  Control, or Influence (FOCI). If a PM requires an SSA-cleared company to have access to
  proscribed information, the PM and contracting officer must complete a NID to confirm that
  disclosure of such information will not harm national security interests. Proscribed
  information includes Top Secret, COMSEC materiel, restricted data, SAP and SCI. Access
  to the proscribed information will not be granted without an approved NID and the approval
  of the agency with control jurisdiction of the proscribed information. The requirement for
  NIDs applies equally to new and existing contracts with SSA-cleared companies when
  acquired by foreign interests. Upon notification from DSS of the pending merger or
  acquisition of a cleared company by a foreign interest, the program office should review the
  company’s FOCI action plan. If the company is proposing to use an SSA to mitigate FOCI,
  DSS will advise the program office of the need for a NID, and SAF/AAZ will determine
  whether a favorable NID will be issued. See DoDI 5220.22, National Industrial Security
  Program, DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual and
  AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management.
  A7.2.10. Technology Assessment Report and Control Plan (TA/CP)/Delegation of
  Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL). Foreign disclosure is the act of permitting access to
  classified or controlled unclassified military information by an authorized representative of a
  foreign government or international organization. It includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS),
  FMS-Direct Commercial Sales hybrid programs, Co-Production, International Cooperative
AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    65


  Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation agreements, when in operating or test
  environments with foreign government personnel. One-time disclosure authorizations may
  be documented in a specific memorandum or visit authorization. Requirements for
  continuing information disclosures are normally documented in a DDL. See DoD 5200.1-M
  and AFI 16-201 for TA/CP and DDL requirements.
     A7.2.10.1. The TA/CP is accomplished anytime the program may have foreign
     involvement and serves three purposes:
         A7.2.10.1.1. Assesses the feasibility of U.S. participation in joint programs from a
         foreign disclosure and technology security perspective.
         A7.2.10.1.2. Supports drafting the Delegation of DDL. A DDL is a prerequisite to
         the disclosure of U.S. Government information to foreign entities.
         A7.2.10.1.3. Serves as a supporting document for decision reviews.
     A7.2.10.2. The TA/CP consists of two sections:
         A7.2.10.2.1. Technology Assessment Section. This section focuses on the risk of
         disclosing U.S. technology or information to other countries. It identifies the
         technology of concern, its classification or control method, and why it is under
         development. It evaluates the availability of comparable foreign technology,
         previously released U.S. technologies, and any material released under other
         programs. Finally, it compares technologies and military capabilities, and possible
         damage resulting from compromise of these technologies or capabilities.
         A7.2.10.2.2. Control Plan Section. This section describes the measures necessary to
         minimize potential risk associated with the material’s release. It should discuss
         reducing the risk of compromise by phasing the release of information, using
         disclosure restrictions and using special security procedures to limit access to critical
         information. It should also include a discussion of any modification to the system,
         design, or production produced under the agreement, or any legal or proprietary
         concerns associated with such an agreement.
     A7.2.10.3. DDLs are issued when there are requirements to disclose information in
     support of continuing programs. The program office, in coordination with the command
     or foreign disclosure officer (FDO), prepares a DDL derived from the TA/CP as part of
     the request for authority to negotiate and conclude an international agreement. Reference
     AFI 16-201 for further guidance.
  A7.2.11. Life Cycle Protection Cost Estimates. The following guidance is intended to
  clarify how to allocate protection costs in the PPP. Direct costs associated with the Work
  Breakdown Structure (WBS) should be documented in the PPP and detailed for each
  acquisition phase. Protection costs include manpower, equipment, services, and other costs
  that directly contribute to the protection of CPI, critical components and other sensitive
  system design information. Protection costs should be reflected in accordance with the
  WBS. See MIL-STD-881, Work Breakdown Structures for Defense Materiel Items.
     A7.2.11.1. Identify only the costs of Program Protection that exceed normal NISPOM
     costs. (Accounting for security costs associated with NISPOM compliance has limited
 66                                                     AFPAM63-113 17 OCTOBER 2013


      utility as the majority of defense contractors include costs as part of management costs
      and do not normally segregate security costs for NISPOM compliance.)
      A7.2.11.2. Manpower costs for protection during operational use as well as the
      development program should include all personnel who provide direct support to the
      program protection effort.
      A7.2.11.3. List equipment used in the protection effort and associated cost. For
      example, include the cost of safes, secure computers, software, entry controls, alarms,
      vault area construction, administrative equipment, and security equipment engineered
      into the weapon system.
      A7.2.11.4. Other miscellaneous costs should be identified including the transport of
      classified components.
      A7.2.11.5. Additional requirements to meet demilitarization and disposal costs should be
      identified if applicable.
      A7.2.11.6. PPP cost information cannot be released to international customers.
   A7.2.12. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests. PMs should evaluate and include
   prudent and necessary life cycle planning to address FOIA requests in accordance with DOD
   5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program. The primary objective is
   to develop methods to effectively balance public release needs and protection of program
   information.
   A7.2.13. Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO). PMs should use prudent life cycle
   planning to address the need to:
   A7.2.13.1. Mark data controlled IAW DoDI 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical
   Documents.
   A7.2.13.2. Withhold unclassified technical data from public disclosure in accordance with
   DoDD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure and AFI
   61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information.
A7.3. Security Actions during PPP Coordination. Use encryption when emailing PPPs. CPI
should be protected as FOUO at a minimum. See DoD 5200.01-v4 for exemptions. If there is
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) used in association with a system, the program
office should coordinate the PPP with the cognizant Special Security Office (SSO).

                   CPI IDENTIFICATION SURVEY AND DECISION AID

A8.1. The USD (I)-developed CPI identification survey provides a common set of criteria to
assist PMs in determining if their program, project, or research effort has CPI. A Research,
Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) organization (e.g. the Air Force Research
Laboratory) whose programs do not have a DoDI 5000.02 acquisition program element may
tailor the CPI identification survey.
A8.2. The PM should complete and certify inputs to this survey.
A8.3. Once the survey is completed, the PM signs the certification page and delivers the survey,
certification pages, and supporting documentation to the appropriate AFMC or AFSPC
organization protection POC.
A8.4. The PEO and/or the responsible organization protection office will use the results of the
survey to determine the potential for CPI and what follow-on actions, if any, may be required
IAW DoD 5200.01-v1. The decision should be documented in an official memorandum to the
office submitting the survey. CPI and critical components should be protected based on
classification level as described in DoDM 5200.1-M.
A8.5. Administrative items that do not apply should be marked “N/A”.
A8.6. All survey questions should be answered. Clarifying remarks may be attached on a
separate piece of paper.
A8.7. If questions arise while completing this survey, contact the responsible protection office
for the program.
A8.8. When filled in, the CPI survey is classified and controlled according to content. At a
minimum, CPI surveys will be marked “For Official Use Only” IAW DoD 5200.01-v4.
