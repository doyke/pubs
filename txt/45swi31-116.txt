       driver’s performance. Measures should include counseling, remedial driving training,
       and rehabilitation programs if violator is entitled to the programs. Driving privileges may
       also be suspended for up to 6 months if a driver continually violates installation parking
       regulations. The accumulation of 12 points in a 12-month period or 18 points in a 24-
       month period for repeated parking violations may result in suspension of driving
8                                                              45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


       privileges. Any vehicle parked without authorization in an area restricted due to force
       protection measures may subject the driver to immediate suspension by the 45 SW/CC.
       Vehicle will be towed at the owner’s and/or operator’s expense.
       2.4.1.2. The 45 SW/CC has discretionary power to withdraw the authorization of active
       duty military personnel, DoD civilian employees, non-appropriated funds (NAF)
       employees, contractors, and subcontractors to operate Government vehicles. Notify 45th
       Contracting Squadron (45 CONS) and the cognizant Contracting Officer who oversees
       the contract execution of actions taken against contractors, subcontractors or their
       employees.
       2.4.1.3. Immediate suspension of installation POV driving privileges pending resolution
       of an intoxicated driving incident is authorized for active duty military personnel, family
       members, retired members of the military services, DoD civilian personnel, and others
       with installation driving privileges, regardless of the geographic location of the
       intoxicated driving incident. Suspension is authorized for non-DoD affiliated civilians
       only with respect to incidents occurring on the installation or in areas subject to military
       traffic supervision. After a review of available informational as specified in paragraph
       2.6, installation driving privileges will be immediately suspended pending resolution of
       the intoxicated driving accident in the following circumstances:
           2.4.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine
           contents of blood for alcohol or other drugs.
           2.4.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08
           percent by volume (0.08 grams per 100 milliliters) or higher.
           2.4.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.05 percent by volume but less
           than 0.08 percent blood alcohol by volume (as measured in grams per 100 milliliters).
           2.4.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official documentation of the circumstances of
           an apprehension for intoxicated driving.
           2.4.1.3.5. Persons under the age of 21, when in the United States or where legal
           alcohol consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level
           standard of .01 or higher is reason for automatic suspension. Refer to AFI 31-218(I)
           2-4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance.
    2.4.2. Revocation.
       2.4.2.1. The revocation of installation POV driving privileges is a severe administrative
       measure to be exercised for serious moving violations or when other available corrective
       actions fail to produce the desired driver improvement. Revocation of the driving
       privilege will be for a specified period but never less than 6 months, will apply at all
       military installations and remain in effect upon reassignment.
       2.4.2.2. Driving privileges are subject to revocation when an individual fails to comply
       with any of the conditions requisite to the granting privilege (see para 2.1). Revocation
       of installation driving privileges is authorized for military personnel, family members,
       DoD civilian employees, contractors, and other individuals with installation driving
       privileges. For civilian guests, revocation is authorized only with respect to incidents
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  9


      occurring on 45 SW installations. Notify 45 CONS and the cognizant Contracting
      Officer of actions taken against contractors, subcontractors or their employees.
      2.4.2.3. Driving privileges will be revoked for a mandatory period of not less than 1 year
      in the following circumstances:
          2.4.2.3.1. The 45 MSG/CC has determined that the person lawfully apprehended for
          driving under the influence refused to submit to or complete a test to measure the
          alcohol content in the blood, or detect the presence of any other drug.
          2.4.2.3.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian
          administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of driver’s license for
          intoxicated driving. Appropriate official documentation of such conviction is
          required as the basis for revocation.
      2.4.2.4. When temporary suspensions under paragraph 2.4.1.3, above, are followed by
      revocations, the period of revocation is computed beginning from the date the original
      suspension was imposed, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
      may have been restored pending resolution of charges. (Example: privileges were
      initially suspended on 1 January 2000 for a charge of intoxicated driving with a BAC of
      0.14 percent. A hearing was held, extreme family hardship was substantiated, and
      privileges were restored on 1 February pending resolution of the charge. On 1 March
      2000, the driver was convicted for intoxicated driving. The mandatory 1-year revocation
      period will consist of January 2000 plus March 2000 through January 2001, for a total of
      12 months with no installation driving privileges.)
      2.4.2.5. The 45 SW/CC will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of not
      less than 1 year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the 45
      SW/CC determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve
      public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
2.5. Remedial Driver Training Programs. 45 SW does not conduct remedial driver training
programs. Personnel may arrange for participation in courses conducted by local civil
authorities. The 45 SW will incur no expenses for personnel attending courses off the
installation.
2.6. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.6.1. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in effect until the 45 SW/CC
   makes a final decision. Requested hearings must take place within 14 calendar days of
   notice.
   2.6.2. For offenses other than intoxicated driving, suspension or revocation of the
   installation driving privilege will not become effective until the 45 MSG/CC notifies the
   affected person and offers that person an administrative hearing. Suspension or revocation
   will take place 14 calendar days after written notice is received unless the affected person
   makes an application for a hearing within this period. Such application will stay pending
   suspension or revocation for a period of 14 calendar days.
      2.6.2.1. If, due to action by the Government, a hearing is not held within 14 calendar
      days, the suspension will not take place until such time as the person is granted a hearing
      and is notified of the action of the 45 MSG/CC. However, if the affected person requests
10                                                           45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


     that the hearing be continued to a date beyond the 14-day period, the suspension or
     revocation will become effective immediately on receipt of notice that the request for
     continuance has been granted, and remain in force pending a hearing at a scheduled
     hearing date.
     2.6.2.2. If it is determined as a result of a hearing to suspend or revoke the affected
     person’s driving privilege, the suspension or revocation will become effective when the
     person receives the written notification of such action. In the event that written
     notification cannot be verified either through a return receipt for mail or delivery through
     command channels, the hearing authority will determine the effective date on a case-by-
     case basis.
     2.6.2.3. If the revocation or suspension is imposed after such hearing, the person whose
     driving privilege has been suspended or revoked will have the right to appeal or request
     reconsideration. Such requests must be forwarded through command channels to the
     45 MSG/CC within 14 calendar days from the date the individual is notified of the
     suspension or revocation resulting from the administrative hearing. The suspension or
     revocation will remain in effect pending a final ruling on the request. Requests for
     restricted privileges will be considered per paragraph 2.9.
     2.6.2.4. If driving privileges are temporarily restored (that is, for family hardship)
     pending resolution of charges, the period of revocation (after final authority
     determination) will still total the mandatory 12 months. The final date of the revocation
     will be adjusted to account for the period when the violator’s privileges were temporarily
     restored, as this period does not count towards the revocation time.
  2.6.3. For drunk driving or driving under the influence offenses, reliable evidence readily
  available will be presented promptly to 45 MSG/CC for review and authorization for
  immediate suspension of installation driving privileges.
     2.6.3.1. Reliable evidence includes witness statements, military or civilian police report
     of apprehension, chemical test results if completed, refusal to consent to complete
     chemical testing, videotapes, statements by the apprehended individual, field sobriety or
     preliminary breath tests results and other pertinent evidence. Immediate suspension
     should not be based solely on published lists of arrested persons, statements by parties
     not witnessing the apprehension, or telephone conversations or other informational not
     supported by documented and reliable evidence.
     2.6.3.2. Reviews normally will be accomplished within the first normal duty day
     following final assembly of evidence.
     2.6.3.3. The 45 SW/CC authorizes the DFC to conduct reviews and authorize
     suspensions in cases where the 45 MSG/CC is not reasonably available and, in the
     judgment of the DFC, such immediate action is warranted. 45 SFS personnel act in an
     advisory capacity to 45 SW/CC. Review by the 45 MSG/CC will follow as soon as
     practical in such cases. When a suspension notice is based on the DFC’s review, there is
     no requirement for confirmation notice following subsequent review by the 45 MSG/CC.
     2.6.3.4. For active duty military personnel, final written notice of suspension for
     intoxicated driving will be provided to the individual’s chain of command for immediate
     presentation to the individual. 45 SFS provide a copy of the temporary suspension to the
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  11


      individual at the time of the incident or may provide a copy of the final determination at
      the time of the incident, as predetermined by the 45 MSG/CC.
      2.6.3.5. For civilian personnel, written notice of suspension for intoxicated driving will
      normally be provided without delay via certified mail. 45 SFS personnel provide a copy
      of the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident if available or
      may provide a copy of the final determination at the time of the incident. If the person is
      employed on 45 SW installations, such notice will be forwarded through the military or
      civilian supervisor. When the notice of suspension is forwarded through the supervisor,
      the person whose privileges are suspended will be required to provide written
      acknowledgment of receipt of the suspension notice.
      2.6.3.6. Notices of suspension for intoxicated driving will include the following:
         2.6.3.6.1. The fact that the suspension can be made a revocation under paragraph
         2.4.2.
         2.6.3.6.2. The right to request, in writing, a hearing before the 45 MSG/CC to
         determine if installation driving privileges will be restored pending resolution of the
         charge; and that such request must be made within 14 calendar days of the final
         notice of suspension.
         2.6.3.6.3. The right of military personnel to be represented by counsel at his or her
         own expense and to present evidence and witnesses at his or her own expense.
         2.6.3.6.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative
         present at the administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and
         regulations.
         2.6.3.6.5. Written acknowledgment of receipt to be signed by the individual whose
         privileges are to be suspended or revoked.
      2.6.3.7. If a hearing is requested, it must take place within 14 calendar days of receipt of
      the request. The suspension for intoxicated driving will remain in effect until a decision
      has been made by the 45 MSG/CC, but will not exceed 14 calendar days after the hearing
      while awaiting the decision. If no decision has been made by that time, full driving
      privileges will be restored until such time as the accused is notified of a decision to
      continue the suspension.
      2.6.3.8. Hearing on suspension actions under paragraph 2.4.2 for drunk or impaired
      driving pending resolution of charges will cover only the following pertinent issues of
      whether:
         2.6.3.8.1. Law enforcement officials had reasonable grounds to believe the person
         was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle under the influence of
         alcohol or other drugs.
         2.6.3.8.2. The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for a driving under the
         influence offense.
         2.6.3.8.3. The person was lawfully requested to submit his or her blood, breath, or
         urine in order to determine the content of alcohol or other drugs, and was informed of
         the implied consent policy (consequences of refusal to take or complete the test).
 12                                                            45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


          2.6.3.8.4. The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol or other drug content of
          blood, breath, or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result
          was 0.08 or higher BAC, or between 0.05 and 0.08 BAC on 45 SW installations; or
          showed results indicating the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
          apprehension or in violation of State laws for an off-installation apprehension.
          2.6.3.8.5. The testing methods were valid and reliable and the results accurately
          evaluated.
      2.6.3.9. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.4.2.3 for intoxicated driving, the
      revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge. (Pleas
      of nolo contendere (no contest) are considered equivalent to guilty pleas.)
          2.6.3.9.1. Revocations are effective as of the date of conviction or other findings that
          confirm the charges. Test refusal revocations will be in addition to any other
          revocation incurred during a hearing. Hearing authority will determine if revocations
          for multiple offenses will run consecutively or concurrently taking into consideration
          if offenses occurred on same occasion or different times, dates. The exception is that
          test refusal will be 1 year automatic revocation in addition to any other suspension.
          2.6.3.9.2. The notice that revocation is automatic may be placed in the suspension
          letter. If it does not appear in the suspension letter, a separate letter must be sent and
          revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice.
          2.6.3.9.3. Revocations cancel any full or restricted driving privileges that may have
          been restored during suspension and the resolution of the charges. Requests for
          restoration of full driving privileges are not authorized.
2.7. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.7.1. After coordination with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), unit commanders will direct
   drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor vehicle/traffic
   incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is reasonable
   suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing. Commanders
   are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) is taken as soon after the incident
   as possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement. For additional
   information refer to AFI 31-218(I).
   2.7.2. The commander will ensure military personnel are referred to the 45 SW’s Alcohol
   and Drug Abuse Program when they are convicted of, or receive an official administrative
   action for, any offense involving driving under the influence. A first offender may be
   referred to treatment if evidence of substance abuse exists in addition to the offense of
   intoxicated driving. The provisions of this paragraph do not limit the commander’s
   prerogatives concerning other actions that may be taken against an offender under separate
   Air Force polices.
   2.7.3. Active duty Air Force personnel apprehended for drunk driving, on or off the
   installation, will be referred by their respective chain of command to the Air Force Substance
   Abuse Office for evaluation in accordance with AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse
   Prevention and Treatment, within 7 calendar days.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                   13


   2.7.4. Active duty Air Force personnel involved in any alcohol incident will immediately be
   subjected to a urinalysis for drug content. If consent is not given for the test, a command-
   directed test will be administered in accordance with guidance from SJA. Contact SJA for
   Air Force civilian personnel involved in any alcohol incidents as to whether a urinalysis for
   drug content is required.
2.8. Restoration of Driving Privileges Upon Acquittal of Intoxicated Driving. The
suspension of driving privileges for military and civilian personnel shall be restored if a final
disposition indicates a finding of not guilty, charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to intoxicated driving, or where an equivalent determination is made in a nonjudicial
proceeding. The following are exceptions to the rule in which suspensions will continue to be
enforced:
   2.8.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.8.2. The preliminary suspension resulted from a valid BAC test (unless disposition of the
   charges was based on invalidity of the BAC test). In the case of a valid BAC test, the
   suspension will continue, pending completion of a hearing as specified in paragraph 2.6. In
   such instances, the individual will be notified in writing that the suspension will continue and
   of the opportunity to request a hearing within 14 calendar days.
       2.8.2.1. At the hearing, the arrest report, the commander’s report of official disposition,
       information presented by the individual, and such other information as the 45 MSG/CC
       may deem appropriate will be considered.
       2.8.2.2. If the 45 MSG/CC determines by preponderance of evidence that the individual
       was engaged in intoxicated driving, the revocation will be for 1 year from the date of the
       original preliminary suspension.
   2.8.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under a
   preliminary suspension or revocation.
   2.8.4. An administrative determination has been made by the State licensing authority to
   suspend or revoke driving privileges.
   2.8.5. The individual has failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s
   training program.
2.9. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
   2.9.1. Probation or restricted driving privileges will not be granted to any person whose
   driver license or right to operate motor vehicles is under suspension or revocation by a State
   or Federal licensing authority. Prior to application for probation or restricted driving
   privileges, a State or Federal driver’s license or right to operate motor vehicles must be
   reinstated. The burden of proof for reinstatement of driving privileges lies with the person
   applying for probation or restricted driving privileges. Revocations for test refusals shall
   remain.
   2.9.2. The 45 MSG/CC may grant restricted driving privileges or probation on a case-by-
   case basis provided the person’s State driver’s license or right to operate motor vehicles
   remains valid to accommodate any of the following reasons:
       2.9.2.1. Mission requirements.
 14                                                             45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


      2.9.2.2. Unusual personal or family hardships.
      2.9.2.3. Delays exceeding 90 days, not attributed to the person concerned, in the formal
      disposition of an apprehension or charges that are the basis for any type of suspension or
      revocation.
      2.9.2.4. When there is no reasonably available alternate means of transportation to
      officially assigned duties. In this instance, a limited exception can be granted for the sole
      purpose of driving directly to and from the place of duty.
   2.9.3. The terms and limitations on a restricted driving privilege (for example, authorization
   to drive to and from place of employment or duty, or selected installation facilities such as
   hospital, commissary, and or other facilities) will be specified in writing and provided to the
   individual concerned. Persons found in violation of the restricted privilege are subject to
   revocation action as prescribed in paragraph 2.4.
   2.9.4. The conditions and terms of probation will be specified in writing and provided to the
   individual concerned. The original suspension or revocation term in its entirety may be
   activated to commence from the date of the violation of probation. In addition, separate
   action may be initiated based on the commission of any traffic, criminal, or military offense
   that constitutes a probation violation.
   2.9.5. Any DoD employees and contractors, who can demonstrate that suspension or
   revocation of installation driving privileges would constructively remove them from
   employment, may be given a limiting suspension/revocation that restricts driving on the
   45 SW installations to the most direct route to and from their respective work sites (see 5
   USC 2302(b)(10)). This is not to be construed as limiting the commander from suspension
   or revocation of on-duty driving privileges or seizure of AF Form 2293, even if this action
   would constructively remove a person from employment in those instances in which the
   person’s duty requires driving from place to place on the 45 SW installations.
2.10. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.10.1. Commanders will recognize the interests of the States in matters of POV
   administration and driver licensing. Statutory authority may exist within some States
   reciprocal suspension and revocation of driving privileges. See Chapter 4 of this instruction
   for additional information on exchanging and obtaining information with civilian law
   enforcement agencies concerning infractions by Armed Service personnel off-installation.
   45 SW will honor the reciprocal authority and direct the 45 SFS to pursue reciprocity with
   State licensing authorities. Upon receipt of written or other official law enforcement
   communication relative to the suspension/revocation of driving privileges, the 45 SW/CC
   will terminate driving privileges as if violations occurred within its own jurisdiction.
   2.10.2. When imposing a suspension or revocation for an off-installation offense, the
   effective date should be the same as civil disposition, or the date that State driving privileges
   are suspended or revoked. This effective date can be retroactive.
   2.10.3. If statutory authority does not exist within the State for formal military reciprocity,
   the following procedures will be adopted:
      2.10.3.1. Commanders will recognize official documentation of suspensions/revocations
      imposed by State authorities. Administrative actions (suspension/revocations, or if
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                     15


       recognized, point assessment) for moving traffic violations off the installation should not
       be less than required for similar offenses on the installation. When notified by state
       authorities of a suspension or revocation, the person’s AF Form 2293 may also be
       suspended.
       2.10.3.2. The issuing State licensing authority will be notified as soon as practical when
       a person’s installation driving privileges are suspended or revoked for any period, and
       immediately for refusal to submit to a lawful BAC test. The notification will be sent to
       the appropriate State DMV per reciprocal agreements. In the absence of electronic
       communication technology, the appropriate State DMV will be notified by official
       certified mail. The notification will include the basis for the suspension/revocation and
       the BAC level if applicable.
2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Driving in violation of a suspension or revocation imposed under this regulation will
   result in the original period of suspension or revocation being increased by 2 years. In
   addition, administrative action may be initiated based on the commission of any traffic,
   criminal, or military offenses, for example, active duty military personnel driving on the
   installation in violation of a lawful order.
   2.11.2. For each subsequent determination within a 5 year period that revocation is
   authorized under paragraph 2.4.2, military personnel, DoD civilians, contractors, and NAF
   employees will be prohibited from obtaining or using an AF Form 2293 for 6 months for
   each such incident. A determination whether DoD civilian personnel should be prohibited
   from obtaining or using an AF Form 2293 will be made in accordance with the laws and
   regulations applicable to civilian personnel. Contact 45 SW Civilian Personnel office for
   further guidance. This does not preclude a commander from imposing such prohibition for a
   first offense, or for a longer period of time for a first or subsequent offense, or for such other
   reasons as may be authorized.
   2.11.3. Commanders may extend a suspension or revocation of driving privileges on
   personnel until completion of an approved remedial driver training course or alcohol or drug
   counseling programs after proof is provided.
   2.11.4. Commanders may extend a suspension or revocation of driving privileges on civilian
   personnel convicted of intoxicated driving on the installation until successful completion of a
   State or installation approved alcohol or drug rehabilitation program.
2.12. Reinstatement of Driving Privileges. Reinstatement of driving privileges shall be
automatic, provided all revocations applicable have expired, proper proof of completion of

                                   TRAFFIC SUPERVISION

4.1. Traffic Planning.
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   A traffic supervision program includes traffic circulation planning and control of motor
   vehicle traffic; publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations; and investigation
   of motor vehicle accidents.
   4.1.2. The 45 SW/CC has developed traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and
   most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. Circulation planning is a major part of all
   long-range master planning at 45 SW installations. The traffic circulation plan is developed
   by the 45 SW Traffic Control Board/Sign Committee. Highway engineering representatives
   from adjacent civil communities are consulted, as needed, to ensure 45 SW plans are
   compatible with the current and future circulation plan of the community. The plan should
   include the following:
       4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
       4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic using planned direction, including measures for
       special events and adverse road or weather conditions.
       4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
       traffic directors or wardens, including trained school–crossing guards.
       4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
       4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
       4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies will provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and
   flow patterns, and points of congestion. The 45 SW Traffic Control Board/Sign Committee
   coordinates traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data will help determine major
   and minor routes, location of traffic control devices, and conditions requiring engineering or
   enforcement services.
4.2. Installation Traffic Code.
   4.2.1. The traffic code contains the rules of the road (parking violations, towing instructions,
   safety equipment, and other key provisions). These codes, where possible, conform to the
   code of the State or territory in which the 45 SW installations are located. In addition, the
   development and publication of 45 SW traffic codes are be based on the following:
       4.2.1.1. Highway Safety Program Standards (23 USC 402).
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance
       published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances.
   4.2.2. The 45 SW traffic code contains policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
   impounding, and inventorying of POVs. These provisions contain the following:
18                                                            45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


     4.2.2.1. Specific violations and conditions under which the POV will be impounded and
     towed.
     4.2.2.2. Procedures to immediately notify the vehicle owner.
     4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing and storing impounded vehicles.
     4.2.2.4. Actions to dispose of the vehicle after lawful impoundment.
     4.2.2.5. Violators are responsible for all costs of towing, storage, and impounding of
     vehicles for other than evidentiary reasons.
  4.2.3. The 45 SW traffic code also contains the provisions discussed below.
     4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. For motorcycles and other self-propelled, open, 2-
     wheel, 3-wheel, and 4-wheel vehicles powered by a motorcycle-type engine, the
     following traffic rules apply:
         4.2.3.1.1. Headlights will be on at all times when in operation.
         4.2.3.1.2. A rear view mirror will be attached to each side of the handlebars.
         4.2.3.1.3. Approved protective helmets, eye protection (goggles, wrap around
         glasses, or full-face shield designed to meet or exceed American National Standards
         Institute (ANSI) Standard ZZ87.1), sturdy over-the-ankle footwear that affords
         protection for the feet and ankles, long trousers, long-sleeved shirt or jacked and full-
         fingered gloves or mittens that are made from leather or other abrasion-resistant
         materials will be worn by operators and passengers when in operation. Brightly
         colored or reflective outer upper garments are highly recommended.
     4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
         4.2.3.2.1. All drivers and passengers on 45 SW installations will wear seat belts, or in
         the case of infants, be properly restrained. Seat belts will be worn by all operators
         and passengers of US GOVs on or off the 45 SW installations. Seat belts will also be
         worn by all military Service members and Reserve Component members on active
         Federal Service driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the 45 SW installations.
         4.2.3.2.2. Require the use of child safety seats consistent with Florida or host nation
         laws. If there is no host nation law, all children under 4 years of age regardless of
         weight or less than 45 pounds regardless of age shall be properly secured in an
         appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 4 through 7, weighing 45 pounds or
         more and less than 4 feet 9 inches shall be properly secured in a booster seat or other
         appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 8 and above and no less than 4 feet 9
         inches in height will be properly secured in a vehicle seat belt or booster seat. The
         child safety seat or booster seat will be certified by the manufacturer to meet all
         applicable Federal performance standards or host nation requirements and will be
         installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
         4.2.3.2.3. Restraint systems are required only in vehicles manufactured after model
         year 1966.
     4.2.3.3. Driver distractions. Vehicle operators on 45 SW installations and operators of
     GOVs will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  19


      a hands-free device. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other
      listening devices (except for hands–free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle
      is prohibited. Use of those devices impairs driving and masks or prevents recognition of
      emergency signals, alarms, announcements, the approach of vehicles, and human speech.
      4.2.3.4. Only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of on-
      installation driving privileges, or other actions) will be initiated against Service members
      for off-installation violations of the 45 SW traffic code.
      4.2.3.5. 45 SW installations areas having concurrent or exclusive Federal jurisdiction,
      traffic law violations which are State criminal offenses, are made applicable under the
      provisions of 18 USC 13.
      4.2.3.6. In Florida, not all violations of traffic law are considered criminal offenses and
      cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. IAW DoDD 5525.4, enclosure 1, expressly adopts
      the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws of Florida and makes these laws applicable to
      45 SW installations having concurrent or exclusive Federal jurisdiction. It also delegates
      authority to 45 SW/CC to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and
      regulations for 45 SW installations. Persons found guilty of violating the vehicular and
      pedestrian traffic laws made applicable on 45 SW installations under provisions of that
      directive are subject to a fine as determined by the local magistrate or imprisonment for
      not more than 30 days, or both, for each violation.
      4.2.3.7. In 45 SW installations where violations of traffic laws cannot be assimilated
      because the Federal Government’s jurisdictional authority on the installations or parts of
      the installations is only proprietary, neither 18 USC 13 nor the delegation memorandum
      in DoDD 5525.4, enclosure 1, will permit enforcement of Florida traffic laws in Federal
      courts. 45 SFS on proprietary 45 SW installations must rely on either administrative
      sanctions related to the 45 SW installation driving privilege or enforcement of traffic
      laws by Florida law enforcement authorities.
4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize voluntary compliance by drivers and can be achieved by the
   following actions:
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National
      Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
      Control Devices for Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with
      drivers and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or a defective vehicle is
      observed in operation.
      4.3.1.4. Maintaining an aggressive program to detect and apprehend persons who drive
      while privileges are suspended or revoked.
      4.3.1.5. Using sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue
      citations, or warn the offender.
 20                                                             45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


   4.3.2. Selective enforcement will be used when practical. Selective enforcement deters
   traffic violations and reduces accidents by the presence or suggested presence of law
   enforcement personnel at places where violations, congestion, or accidents frequently occur.
   Selective enforcement applies proper enforcement measures to traffic congestion and focuses
   on selected time periods, conditions, and violations that cause accidents. 45 SFS personnel
   use selective enforcement because that practice is the most effective use of resources.
   4.3.3. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
       4.3.3.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.3.3.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement techniques.
       4.3.3.3. Enforcing BAC standards (see para 4.11).
       4.3.3.4. Denying installation driving privileges to persons whose use of alcohol or other
       drugs prevents safe operation of a motor vehicle.
   4.3.4. 45 SW Traffic Control Board/Sign Committee will formally evaluate traffic
   enforcement on a regular basis. That evaluation will examine procedures to determine if the
   following elements of the program are effective in reducing traffic accidents and deaths:
       4.3.4.1. Selective enforcement measures.
       4.3.4.2. Suspension and revocation actions.
       4.3.4.3. Chemical breath–testing programs.
4.4. Speed-Measuring Devices. Speed-measuring devices will be used in traffic control studies
and enforcement programs.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Operators will attend an appropriate training program for the
   equipment in use (Radar/Lidar is used on 45 SW installations).
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
       4.4.2.1. The 45 SW/CC has delegated to the DFC responsibility to ensure that personnel
       selected as operators of such devices meet training and certification requirements
       prescribed by the State of Florida to issue DD Form 1805 (United States District Court
       Violation Notice). Familiarization from a certified operator annotated in training records
       is sufficient to issue a DD Form 1408.
       4.4.2.2. Familiarization training must include the ability to:
          4.4.2.2.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths,
          and injuries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
          4.4.2.2.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
          4.4.2.2.3. Identify and describe the policy and procedures affecting radar speed
          measurement and speed enforcement.
          4.4.2.2.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s
          major components and functions.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  21


          4.4.2.2.5. Demonstrate basic skills in checking calibration and operating the specific
          radar instrument.
          4.4.2.2.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and
          courtroom testimony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
   4.4.3. Recertification. Recertification of operators is not required by Florida.
4.5. Traffic Accident Response and Investigation. 45 SFS respond to all on-installation major
vehicle accidents and make detailed investigations of accidents described below:
   4.5.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
   4.5.2. Protect personal property.
   4.5.3. Normalize traffic.
   4.5.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
   4.5.5. Conduct a formal investigation on the following:
       4.5.5.1. Accidents involving GOVs or Government property on the 45 SW installations
       involving a fatality, personal injury, or estimated property damage in the amount of
       $10,000 or more. The contracted vehicle repair company will provide current estimates
       of the cost of repairs if available. Investigations of off-installation accidents involving
       GOVs will be made in cooperation with the civilian law enforcement agency.
       4.5.5.2. Any POV accidents on the installation involving a fatality, personal injury, or
       when a POV is inoperable as a result of an accident.
   4.5.6. Contact 45 SFS/S5R for local response and investigation procedures for various types
   of accidents to include minor vehicle accidents.
   4.5.7. Accident information will be recorded in the 45 SFS blotter. This information should
   include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
   address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
   number(s)/plate. Also, a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing
   the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued will be included.
4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Accidents requiring immediate reports. The driver or owner of any vehicle involved
   in an accident, as described in paragraph 4.5, above, on the installation, must immediately
   notify the 45 SFS Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC). The operator of any GOV
   involved in a similar accident off the installation must immediately notify the local civilian
   law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, as well as BDOC of the nearest military
   installation.
       4.6.1.1. 45 SFS/S5R is the focal point for sharing, exchanging and gathering off-
       installation accident information of military affiliated personnel. For off-installation
       accidents involving hospitalization or arrest of military affiliated personnel will be
       annotated in the 45 SFS blotter, along with the associated case number from the
       investigating police agency. Contact 45 SFS/S5R for receiving, processing and securing
       traffic related incident reports.
 22                                                            45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


   4.6.2. Investigation records. 45 SFS will record traffic accident investigations on AF Form
   1315, Accident Report. Information will be released according to Air Force policy, the
   Privacy Act, and the Freedom of Informational Act.
   4.6.3. All privately owned vehicle accidents not addressed in paragraph 4.5. Guidance for
   reporting these cases is provided below:
       4.6.3.1. Drivers or owners of POVs will be required to submit a written report to 45
       SFS/S5R within 24 hours of an accident in the following cases.
          4.6.3.1.1. The accident occurred on the installation.
          4.6.3.1.2. The accident involved no personal injury.
          4.6.3.1.3. The accident involved only minor damage to the POV and the vehicle was
          safely and normally driven from the scene under its own power.
       4.6.3.2. Information in the written report cannot be used in criminal proceedings against
       the person submitting it unless it was originally categorized a hit and run and the violator
       is the person submitting the report. Rights advisement will be given prior to any criminal
       traffic statements provided by violators. 45 SFS may require such reporting on AF Form
       1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant. Minor vehicle accidents will be
       recorded in 45 SFS blotters.
4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Data derived from traffic accident investigation reports and from vehicle owner
   accident reports will be analyzed to determine probable causes of accidents. When frequent
   accidents occur at a location, the conditions at the location and the types of accidents
   (collision diagram) will be examined.
   4.7.2. 45 SFS personnel will indicate whether or not seat restraint devices were being used at
   the time of the accident.
   4.7.3. When accidents warrant, the 45 SW/CC may establish a traffic accident review board.
   The board should consist of SFS, CES, Safety, SJA and MDG personnel. The board will
   determine principal factors leading to the accident and recommend measures to reduce the
   number and severity of accidents on and off the installation. Data received from the traffic
   accident review board may be used to inform and educate drivers and to conduct traffic
   engineering studies.
4.8. Parking.
   4.8.1. The 45 SW Traffic Control Board/Sign Committee is chaired by the 45 MSG/CD.
   Members review and approve all requests for reserved parking.
   4.8.2. The most efficient use of existing on and off-street parking space should be stressed
   on a non-reserved (first-come, first-served) basis.
   4.8.3. Requests will be considered for the following: accessible, short-term customer (time
   limited between 15-minutes and 1-hour), delivery/service, visitors, volunteers, organizations
   with unusual working requirements, and government-owned or leased vehicles.
       4.8.3.1. The board will address traffic safety problems and reserve parking issues on
       45 SW installations.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  23


      4.8.3.2. The board will be made up, as a minimum, of the traffic engineer and a
      representative from 45 SFS, 45 SW/SEG and 45 CES/CEO.
      4.8.3.3. If issues cannot wait for a scheduled meeting, proposed action from off-line
      meetings will be reviewed and approved by 45 MSG/CD.
      4.8.3.4. Traffic safety problems will include issues stemming from personal
      observations, results of 45 SFS or 45 SW/SEG mishap investigations, hazard report
      evaluations and safety inspection findings.
      4.8.3.5. Reserved parking facilities should be designated as parking by permit or
      numerically by category of eligible parkers. Designation of parking spaces by name,
      grade, rank, or title should be avoided.
      4.8.3.6. The board will assign parking spaces according to the following priorities, based
      on the shortest walking distance to work/service areas: accessible, official vehicles used
      during duty hours, van and car pools and single occupant vehicles.
      4.8.3.7. Mark spaces with appropriate signs according to the base striping and sign
      standards.
      4.8.3.8. If reserved parking spaces are not used according to their assignment or there is
      a change in the requirement for the space, the space is reviewed for removal. Report
      changes to the 45 SW Traffic Control Board/Sign Group via the 45 CES Customer
      Service Desk.
      4.8.3.9. Reserved parking spaces are valid 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Vehicles
      parking in the reserved spaces without a permit or proper justification are subject to being
      issued citations. Organizations with reserved parking spaces are responsible for reporting
      violations to the 45 SFS.
      4.8.3.10. Clearly mark visitor parking at convenient locations.
      4.8.3.11. Reserved parking in community areas will receive more strict scrutiny in order
      to better facilitate the customer. Community areas include the Base Exchange,
      Commissary, Mini-Mall, Medical Clinic, Dental Clinic, Satellite Pharmacy, Fitness
      Center, and Base Library. They will be limited to only 45 SW/CC, 45 SW/CV, other 0-6,
      E-9, handicap accessible, volunteer by permit, motivational/incentive-based, and short-
      term spaces. No more than a total of 5% of the non-accessible parking in these areas may
      be reserved.
      4.8.3.12. Certain community areas on base have been identified as multi-use facilities.
      These facilities are classified “multi-use” because of their unique nature. They can serve
      as either their primary function or as a meeting place for official business (commander’s
      call, retirement ceremony, formal functions, etc.). These locations are: The Tides (north
      and south), Riverside Dining, Manatee Cove Golf Course and Marina and the Bowling
      Alley. Parking is typically reserved at these facilities for positions such as 45 SW/CC,
      45 SW/CV, 45 SW/CCC, flag officers, colonels, etc.
      4.8.3.13. Reserved parking for key personnel is limited to, but not necessarily includes,
      all of the following: 45 SW/CC, group commanders in the grade of O-6 or above,
      squadron commanders, first sergeants, deputy commanders/directors of equal civilian
      grade and persons specifically designated by the 45 SW/CC.
 24                                                            45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


       4.8.3.14. Organizations requesting reserved parking spaces must submit their request in
       writing to the 45 CES Customer Service Desk. The request will be accomplished on an
       AF Form 332 (Work Order) and signed by the unit commander or designee. The AF
       Form 332 must contain the name; grade, office symbol, and duty phone of the requesting
       official and have an exact description of the parking space location. Upon approval,
       45 CES will install the appropriate reserved/restricted parking signs, bumper blocks,
       pavement striping, and/or curb markings.
       4.8.3.15. Accessible spaces will be designated according to the most current Americans
       with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines or Uniform Federal Accessibility
       Standards, whichever is more stringent. More accessible spaces than required will be
       considered on a case-by-case basis. Some areas may need more spaces due to entrance
       locations or function. Accessible parking spaces will be located immediately adjacent to
       the nearest accessible building entrance. NOTE: These spaces will be assigned in every
       parking area in addition to any other reserved parking spaces guidelines.
       4.8.3.16. Organizational commanders may request a limited number of reserved parking
       spaces, normally not exceeding 10% of the total number of parking spaces in the parking
       area. Up to 1/2 of these spaces may be reserved for key personnel. The remainder
       should be reserved for government owned/leased vehicles, functional specific vehicles,
       and visitors. This 10% does not include accessible spaces in accordance with 4.8.2.15
       above.
       4.8.3.17. Bicycles should be secured in a bike rack, to a fixed object, or at a secured area
       when not in use.
       4.8.3.18. Motorcycle parking is permitted at the end of parking lanes in yellow or white
       hashed areas.
   4.8.4. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on an installation.
   Strong enforcement of parking restrictions results in better use of available parking facilities
   and eliminates conditions causing traffic accidents.
   4.8.5. The “Denver boot” should not be used on 45 SW installations.
4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Most traffic violations occurring on 45 SW installations should be referred to the US
   Magistrate. (Refer to AFI 51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors
   Committed By Civilians) However, violations are not referred when:
       4.9.1.1. The operator is driving a GOV at the time of the violation.
       4.9.1.2. A Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the
       matter because the violation occurred in an area where the Federal Government has only
       proprietary legislative jurisdiction.
       4.9.1.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.1.4. A US Magistrate is available but the accused refuses to consent to the
       jurisdiction of the court and the US Attorney refuses to process the case before a US
       District Court.
   4.9.2. Administrative procedures for processing traffic violations.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                25


      4.9.2.1. All traffic violators on military installations will be issued either a DD Form
      1408 Armed Forces Traffic Ticket) or a DD Form 1805, as appropriate.
      4.9.2.2. A copy of all reports on military personnel and DoD civilian employees
      apprehended for intoxicated driving will be forwarded to the mental health alcohol and
      drug abuse facility.
   4.9.3. The following procedures will be used for disposing of traffic violation cases through
   administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice
   (UCMJ) and Federal law:
   4.9.4. The DD Form 1805 will be used to refer violations of Florida traffic laws made
   applicable to the 45 SW installations (Assimilative Crimes Act (18 USC 13) and the
   delegation memorandum in DoDD 5525.4, enclosure 1, and other violations of Federal law)
   to the US Magistrate.
      4.9.4.1. A copy of DD Form 1805 and any traffic violation reports on military personnel
      and DoD civilian employees will be forwarded to the commander or supervisor of the
      violator.
      4.9.4.2. Detailed instructions for properly completing DD Form 1805 are IAW AFI 31-
      201, Volume 3, Flight Operations.
      4.9.4.3. For cases referred to US Magistrates, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 will
      be as follows:
          4.9.4.3.1. 45 SFS/S5R will forward copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US
          District Court (Central Violation Bureau).
          4.9.4.3.2. 45 SFS/S5R will file copy 3 (pink).
          4.9.4.3.3. 45 SFS personnel will provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
      4.9.4.4. When DD Form 1408 is used, one copy (including written warnings) will be
      forwarded through command channels to the service member’s commander, to the
      commander of the military family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or
      employer.
          4.9.4.4.1. . Previous traffic violations committed by the offender and points assessed
          may be shown.
          4.9.4.4.2. For violations that require a report of action taken, the DD Form 1408 will
          be returned to 45 SFS/S5R.
          4.9.4.4.3. When the report is received by 45 SFS/S5R, action will be entered on the
          violator’s driving record.
4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Drunk Drivers.
   4.10.1. Training of Law Enforcement Personnel. As a minimum, 45 SFS personnel will be
   trained to do the following:
      4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating
      motor vehicles.
      4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920 (Alcohol Incident Report).
 26                                                              45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


       4.10.1.3. Perform the three field tests of the improved sobriety testing techniques (see
       para 4.13.2, below).
       4.10.1.4. Determine when a person appears intoxicated but is actually physically or
       mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
       4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. The DFC will ensure that operators of breath–testing devices:
       4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
       4.10.2.2. Meet State of Florida certification requirements.
   4.10.3. Operators must maintain proficiency through refresher training every 4 years as
   required by the State of Florida.
4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
4.11.1. Administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement measures will be
applied uniformly to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is
tested under the implied consent provisions of paragraph 2.3, the results of the test will be
evaluated as follows:

       4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent,
       presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.
       4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.08, presume the person may be
       impaired. This standard may be considered with other competent evidence in
       determining whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
       4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.08 or more, or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs,
       the person was driving under the influence.
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1, above, are percent of weight by volume of alcohol
   in the blood based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. These presumptions will
   be considered with other evidence in determining intoxication.
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Validity of chemical testing. Results of chemical testing are valid under this
   regulation only under the following circumstances:
       4.12.1.1. Blood, urine, or other bodily substances are tested using generally accepted
       scientific and medical methods and standards.
       4.12.1.2. Breath tests are administered by qualified personnel (see para 4.10).
       4.12.1.3. An evidential breath–testing device approved by the State of Florida is used.
       The device is listed on the NHTSA conforming products list published in the
       “Conforming Products List for instruments that conform to the Model Specifications for
       Evidential Breath Testing Devices (58 FR 48705), and amendments,” (see 70 FR 18982,
       para 634.35).
       4.12.1.4. Chemical testing will follow procedures established by the State of Florida.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  27


   4.12.2. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.2.1. 45 MDG or local medical authorities will immediately notify 45 SFS of the
      following:
          4.12.2.1.1. The death of any person involved in a motor vehicle accident.
          4.12.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding such an accident, based on information
          available at the time of admission or receipt of the body of the victim.
      4.12.2.2. Medical authorities will examine the bodies of those persons killed in a motor
      vehicle accident to include drivers, passengers, and pedestrians subject to military
      jurisdiction. They will also examine the bodies of dependents, who are 16 years of age or
      older, if the sponsors give their consent. Tests for the presence and concentration of
      alcohol or other drugs in the person’s blood, bodily fluids, or tissues will be made as soon
      as possible and where practical within 8 hours of death. The test results will be included
      in the medical reports.
      4.12.2.3. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, a blood or breath
      sample will be obtained from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal
      accident.
4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.13.1. 45 SFS personnel usually detect drivers under the influence of alcohol or other drugs
   by observing unusual or abnormal driving behavior. Drivers showing such behavior will be
   stopped immediately. The cause of the unusual driving behavior will be determined, and
   proper enforcement action will be taken.
   4.13.2. When 45 SFS personnel reasonably conclude that the individual driving or in control
   of the vehicle are impaired, field sobriety tests will be conducted on the individual. The DD
   Form 1920 will be used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests.
   45 SFS personnel will use a standard field sobriety test consisting of one-leg stand, walk and
   turn and horizontal gaze nystagmus (if certified), as sanctioned by the NHTSA.
4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
   4.14.2. Tests may be administered only if the following conditions are met:
      4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving, operating, or in actual physical
      control of a motor vehicle on 45 SW installations.
      4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe that the person was driving under the
      influence of alcohol or drugs.
      4.14.2.3. A request was made to the person to consent to the tests combined with a
      warning that failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids
      or breath will result in the revocation of driving privileges.
   4.14.3. As stated in paragraphs 4.14.1 and 4.14.2, above, the 45 SFS personnel relying on
   implied consent will warn the person that driving privileges will be revoked if the person
   fails to voluntarily submit to or complete a requested chemical test. The person does not
   have the right to have an attorney present before stating whether he or she will submit to a
 28                                                             45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


   test, or during the actual test. 45 SW/CC has prescribed testing via bodily fluid (urine or
   blood) or breath. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph 4.12, above. The
   results of chemical tests conducted under the implied consent provisions of this regulation
   may be used as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under UCMJ, Article 15,
   administrative actions, and civilian courts.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder being treated with an anticoagulant. These persons:
       4.14.4.1. May refuse a blood extraction test without penalty.
       4.14.4.2. Will not be administered a blood extraction test to determine alcohol or other
       drug concentration or presence under this regulation.
       4.14.4.3. May be given breath or urine tests, or both.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of driving under the influence refuses to submit to a chemical
   test, a test will not be administered except as specified in paragraph 4.15, below.
4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. The procedures outlined herein pertain only to the investigation of individuals
   stopped, apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a
   motor vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is
   intoxicated. Extractions of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations are
   governed by the Manual for Courts–Martial, United States, Military Rule of Evidence 315
   (2002), and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches.
   Nonconsensual extraction of blood samples is addressed in AFI 44-102, Medical Care
   Management.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extraction must be based on valid search and seizure
   authorization. An individual subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing,
   as described above, may nonetheless be subjected to an involuntary extraction of bodily
   fluids, including blood and urine, only in accordance with the following procedures:
       4.15.2.1. An individual subject to the UCMJ who was driving a motor vehicle and
       suspected of being under the influence of an intoxicant may be subjected to a
       nonconsensual bodily fluid extraction to test for the presence of intoxicants only when
       there is a probable cause to believe that such an individual was driving or in control of a
       vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.
          4.15.2.1.1. A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military
          magistrate obtained pursuant to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States,
          Military Rule of Evidence 315 (2002), is required prior to such nonconsensual
          extraction. Authorization must be obtained via AF Form 1176 (Authorization for
          Search and Seizure) or through verbal acknowledgement to 45 SFS (AF Form 1176
          will be completed within 72 hours of verbal consent).
          4.15.2.1.2. A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when
          there is a clear indication that evidence of intoxication will be found and there is
          reason to believe that the delay necessary to obtain a search authorization would
          result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                 29


          4.15.2.1.3. Because warrantless searches are subject to close scrutiny by the courts,
          obtaining an authorization is highly preferable. Warrantless searches generally
          should be conducted only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate or
          legal officer, and attempts to obtain authorization from an appropriate official prove
          unsuccessful due to the unavailability of a commander or military magistrate.
      4.15.2.2. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
      unsuccessful due to the unavailability of such officials, the commander of a medical
      facility is empowered by the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Military Rule of
      Evidence 315 (2002), to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the
      facility at the time the authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.2.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the 45 MDG/CC should, if
          circumstances permit, coordinate with the 45 SW/SJA or legal officer
          4.15.2.2.2. The 45 MDG/CC authorizing the extraction under the Manual for Courts–
          Martial, United States, Military Rule of Evidence 315 (2002), need not be on duty as
          the attending physician at the facility where the extraction is to be performed and the
          actual extraction may be accomplished by other qualified medical personnel.
          4.15.2.2.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
          individual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Role of 45 MDG personnel. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood
   samples for evidentiary purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of, and not
   limited by, provisions defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual
   medical care pursuant to AFI 44-102. Extraction of blood will be accomplished by qualified
   medical personnel (see the Manual for Courts–Martial, United States, Military Rule of
   Evidence 312(g)).
      4.15.3.1. In performing this duty, medical personnel are expected to use only that
      amount of force that is reasonable and necessary to administer the extraction.
      4.15.3.2. Any force necessary to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction
      normally will be provided by 45 SFS personnel or by personnel acting under orders from
      the member’s unit commander.
      4.15.3.3. Life endangering force will not be used in an attempt to effect nonconsensual
      extractions.
      4.15.3.4. All 45 SFS and medical personnel will keep in mind the possibility that the
      individual may require medical attention for possible disease or injury.
   4.15.4. Nonconsensual extractions of blood. Nonconsensual extractions of blood will be
   done in a manner that will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention. Medical
   personnel will determine the priority to be given involuntary blood extractions when other
   medical treatment is required.
4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3 may request that an additional test be
   done privately. The person may choose a doctor, qualified technician, chemist, registered
   nurse, or other qualified person to do the test. The person must pay the cost of the test. The
 30                                                            45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


   test must be a chemical test approved by the State of Florida. All tests will be completed as
   soon as possible, with any delay being noted on the results.
   4.16.2. If the person requests this test, the suspect is responsible for making all
   arrangements. If the suspect fails to or cannot obtain any additional test, the results of the
   tests that were done at the direction of 45 SFS personnel are not invalid and may still be used
   to support actions under separate AFIs, UCMJ and the US Magistrate Court.
4.17. Off-Installation Traffic Activities. In areas not under military control, civil authorities
enforce traffic laws. 45 SFS/S5R will exchange information with civil authorities to enhance the
chain of command’s visibility of Airman’s off-installation traffic violations. These agreements
will provide for the assessment of traffic points based on reports from State licensing authorities
involving military personnel. 45 SFS/S5R receive reports from civil authorities on serious traffic
violations, accidents, and driving under the influence incidents involving persons subject to this
instruction.
4.18. Compliance with State Laws.
   4.18.1. The 45 SW/CC directs all Service members, contractors and DoD civilian employees
   to comply with State of Florida and local traffic laws when operating GOVs.
   4.18.2. Commanders will coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before
   moving Government vehicles that exceed legal limits or regulations or that may subject
   highway users to unusual hazards (see Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III
   Mobility).
   4.18.3. The 45 SW/CC through 45 SFS maintains liaison with civil enforcement agencies
   and encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. Release of a GOV operator(s) to military authorities unless one of the
       conditions below exists:
           4.18.3.1.1. The offense warrants detention.
           4.18.3.1.2. The person’s condition is such that further operation of a motor vehicle
           could result in injury to the person or others.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of
       Government motor vehicles have:
           4.18.3.2.1. Committed serious violations of civil traffic laws.
           4.18.3.2.2. Been involved in traffic accidents.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of actions by a State to suspend, revoke, or restrict the State
       driver’s license (vehicle operation privilege) of persons who:
           4.18.3.3.1. Operate GOVs.
           4.18.3.3.2. Operate a POV on the installation regularly.
4.19. Additional Roadway Considerations.
   4.19.1. Individuals jogging, running or walking on roadways at night or in inclement
   weather will wear clothing/accessories with retro-reflective properties visible from the front
   and back.
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                 31


      4.19.1.1. Individuals are not authorized to jog, run or walk on South Patrick Drive or
      Phillips Parkway.
   4.19.2. Bicycle, tricycle, or other human powered vehicles, including motorized bicycles are
   prohibited on South Patrick Drive. All persons who ride a bicycle, tricycle, or other human
   powered vehicle, including motorized bicycles, on an 45 SW installation roadways, to
   include flight lines will:
   4.19.3. Wear a highly visible outer garment during the day and outer garment containing
   retro-reflective material at night.
   4.19.4. Wear a properly fastened, approved (e.g., Consumer Product Safety Commission,
   ANSI, Snell Memorial Foundation) bicycle helmet.
   4.19.5. Ensure bicycles are equipped with a white front light visible for 500 feet and red
   reflector or light clearly visible from the rear for 300 feet.
   4.19.6. Skateboards, kick-scooters, roller skates, in-line skates, and other similar equipment
   not meeting DOT motor vehicle standards are prohibited on installation roadways except for
   incidental road access associated with pedestrians and will comply with all pedestrian related
   traffic laws.
   4.19.7. An approved helmet is required to be worn on AF installations.
   4.19.8. The use of portable headphones, earphones, cellular phones, iPods, or other listening
   and entertainment devices (other than hearing aids) while walking, jogging, running,
   bicycling, skating or skateboarding on roadways is prohibited.
  32                                                             45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014

                DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. 45 SW uses SFMIS to record vehicle traffic accidents, DD Form 1408
and DD Form 1805 to record moving violations, locally developed memorandums for suspension
and/or revocation actions, and this instruction to assess traffic points involving military and DoD
civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on
45 SW installations. Refer to Table 5.1 for mandatory minimum or maximum suspension or
revocation periods. Traffic points are not assessed for suspension or revocation actions.

45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                       33


suspension or revocation. Permitting an
unlawful or fraudulent use of an official
driver’s license. Conviction of fleeing, or
attempting to elude, a police officer.
Conviction of racing on the highway.
Receiving a second 1-year suspension or Loss of AM Form 2293 for a minimum of 6
revocation of driving privileges within 5 years. months is discretionary.

NOTES:

1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off–installation offense, the
effective date should be the same as the date of civil conviction, or the date that State or host
nation driving privileges are suspended or revoked. This effective date can be retroactive.

2. No points are assessed for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
violations, revocations must be based on a conviction by a civilian court or courts–martial,
nonjudicial punishment under UCMJ, Art. 15, or a separate hearing as addressed in this
regulation. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation, such as 1 year
for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or concurrently
(total of 12 months). The installation commander’s policy should be applied systematically and
not on a case–by–case basis.
5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially judge driving performance on 45 SW installations. This system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to
interfere in any way with the reasonable exercise of an 45 SW/CC’s prerogative to issue,
suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installation driving privileges.
5.3. Point System Application.
    5.3.1. 45 SW will use the point system and procedures prescribed this document.
    5.3.2. The point system Table 5.2 applies to all operators of US Government motor vehicles,
    on or off Federal property. The system also applies to violators reported to installation
    officials in accordance with paragraph 4.9.
    5.3.3. Points will be assessed when the person is found to have committed a violation and
    the finding is by either the unit commander, civilian supervisor, a military or civilian court
    (including a US Magistrate), or by payment of fine, forfeiture of pay or allowances, or posted
    bond, or collateral.
        5.3.3.1. All fines determined by the US Magistrate will be annotated on the DD Form
        1805. 45 SW/SJA provides 45 SFS a copy of approved fines. 45 SFS will maintain a
        citation handbook with the fines and distribute to patrolman.

5.4. System Procedures
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805
   will serve as a basis for determining point assessment. For DD Form 1408, return
   endorsements will be required from commanders or supervisors.
   5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or SFMIS report of a moving violation, the unit
   commander, designated supervisor, or person otherwise designated by the 45 SW/CC will
   conduct an inquiry. The commander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or
   administrative action. If a case involves judicial or nonjudicial actions, the final report of
   action taken will not be forwarded until final adjudication.
   5.4.3. On receipt of the report of action taken (including action by a US Magistrate Court on
   DD Form 1805), 45 SFS/S5R will assess the number of points appropriate for the offense,
   and record the traffic points or the suspension or revocation of driving privileges on the
   person’s driving record. Except as specified otherwise in this instruction, points will not be
   assessed or driving privileges suspended or revoked when the report of action taken indicates
   that neither disciplinary nor administrative action was taken.
   5.4.4. The 45 SW/CC may require the following driver improvement measures, as
   appropriate:
      5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
      acquired six traffic points within a 6–month period.
      5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview, by the unit commander, of any
      person who has acquired more than 6 but less than 12 traffic points within a 6–month
      period. This counseling or interview should produce recommendations to improve driver
      performance.
      5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
      appears to have mental or physical limits that have had or may have an adverse affect on
      driving performance.
      5.4.4.4. Attending a remedial driver training to improve driving performance.
      5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation,
      counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active military personnel in all cases
      in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or
      accident.
   5.4.5. An individual’s driving privileges may be suspended or revoked as provided by this
   instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
   5.4.6. Persons whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation or an
   accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
   consecutive months) will be notified in writing through official channels (see paragraph 2.6).
   Except for the mandatory minimum or maximum suspension or revocation periods
   prescribed by table 5.1, the 45 SW/CC will establish periods of suspension or revocation for
   any violation not specified in this instruction. Any revocation based on traffic points must be
   no less than 6 months. A longer period may be imposed on the basis of a person’s overall
   driving record considering the frequency, flagrancy, severity of moving violations, and the
   response to previous driver improvement measures. In all cases, military members must
45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                  39


   successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training before driving
   privileges are reinstated.
   5.4.7. Points assessed against a person will remain in effect for point accumulation purposes
   for 24 consecutive months. The review of driver records to delete traffic points should be
   done routinely during records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to
   new duty stations. Completion of a revocation based on points requires removal from the
   driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving
   violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Record entries will remain
   posted on individual driving records for the period of time indicated below.
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations - 3 years.
       5.4.8.2. Non-mandatory suspensions or revocations - 5 years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations - 7 years.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Follow AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures
and Responsibilities, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released from active
duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of officer
component or military and civilian retirement or when continued access to an installation is
authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFI 33-364 records on civilian personnel who are
terminating on-base employment.
   5.5.1. Unit commanders will ensure personnel promptly notify 45 SFS/S5R when they are
   being transferred to another installation, being released from military Service, or ending
   employment.
   5.5.2. If persons being transferred to a new installation have valid points or other entries on
   the driving records, 45 SFS/S5R will forward the records to SFS/S5R of the gaining
   installation. Gaining installation SFS must coordinate with applicable commanders and
   continue any existing suspension or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation
   of traffic points. Traffic points for persons being transferred will continue to accumulate as
   specified in paragraph 5.4.7, above.
   5.5.3. Driving records of military personnel being discharged or released from active duty
   will be retained on file for 2 years and then destroyed. In cases of immediate reenlistment,
   change of officer component or military or civilian retirement when vehicle registration is
   continued, the record will remain active.
   5.5.4. Driving records of civilian personnel terminating employment will be retained on file
   for 2 years and then destroyed.
   5.5.5. Driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
   entries will be forwarded to the sponsor’s gaining installation in the same manner as for
   Service members. At the new installation, records will be analyzed and made available
   temporarily to the sponsor’s unit commander or supervisor for review.
   5.5.6. Driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges will be
   retained. Points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions,
40                                                      45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


  revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents will not be deleted from driver
  records except per paragraphs 5.4.7 and 5.4.8, above.

                   IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for 45 SFS personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the 45 SW in crime prevention, traffic safety and the orderly flow of
   vehicle traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner’s constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable
   search and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.
6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. The POVs should not be impounded unless the vehicles clearly interfere with ongoing
   operations or movement of traffic, threaten public safety or convenience, are involved in
   criminal activity, contain evidence of criminal activity, or are stolen or abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of a POV would be inappropriate when reasonable alternatives to
   impoundment exist.
       6.2.2.1. Attempts should be made to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle
       removed.
       6.2.2.2. The vehicle may be moved a short distance to a legal parking area and
       temporarily secured until the owner is found. 45 SFS will not drive the vehicle without
       consent from the owner.
       6.2.2.3. Another responsible person may be allowed to drive or tow the POV with
       permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. In this
       case, the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle will be informed
       that 45 SFS personnel are not responsible for safeguarding the POV.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
       6.2.3.1. The POV is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, is double parked, and interferes with the orderly flow
          of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
          in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway, so that the vehicle interferes with operations
          or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public. An example
          would be a vehicle parked within 15 feet of a fire hydrant or blocking a properly
          marked driveway of a fire station or aircraft-alert crew facility.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place (theater, Tide
          Club, Riverside Dining Facility, Medical Group, and other facilities).
          6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow–away” zone that is so marked with proper signs.
       6.2.3.2. The POV interferes with:
 42                                                          45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014


          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning operations and attempts to contact the owner have been
          unsuccessful.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster or fire or must be removed
          from the disaster area during cleanup operations.
      6.2.3.3. The POV has been used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
      6.2.3.4. The owner or person in charge has been apprehended and is unable or unwilling
      to arrange for custody or removal.
      6.2.3.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public
      roadways.
      6.2.3.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic incident and the operator is either unavailable
      or physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
      safekeeping.
      6.2.3.7. 45 SFS personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.
6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. Impounded POVs will be towed and stored by a civilian wrecker service.
   6.3.2. The civilian wrecker service ensures accountability and security of towed vehicles is
   maintained. The civilian wrecker service will maintain all keys and will be available 24
   hours a day, every day, to allow entry to Security Forces personnel, as needed.
   6.3.3. Temporary impoundment and towing of POVs for violations of the installation traffic
   code or involvement in criminal activities will be accomplished under the direct supervision
   of 45 SFS personnel.
6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended privately owned vehicles.
      6.4.1.1. The DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be conspicuously placed on
      POVs considered unattended. This action will be documented by an entry in the 45 SFS
      blotter.
      6.4.1.2. The owner will be allowed 3 days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
      vehicle before impoundment action is initiated. If the vehicle has not been removed after
      3 days, it will be removed by the civilian wrecker service. A DD Form 2505, Abandoned
      Vehicle Removal Authorization, will be completed and issued to the civilian wrecker
      service driver by the 45 SFS personnel.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle has been removed, 45 SFS will complete DD Form 2506,
      Vehicle Impoundment Report, as a record of the actions taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. An inventory listing personal property will be done to protect the owner,
          45 SFS personnel, the civilian wrecker service, and the 45 SW.
          6.4.1.3.2. The contents of a closed container such as a suitcase inside the vehicle

45 SWI 31-116 30 January 2014                                                                    43


          present a danger to the public. Merely listing the container and sealing it with security
          tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.3. Personal property must be placed in a secure area for safekeeping.
      6.4.1.4. The DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment will be forwarded by
      certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of
      the impoundment action, and to request informational concerning the owner’s intentions
      pertaining to the disposition of the vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen privately owned vehicles or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. When the POV is to be held for evidentiary purposes, the vehicle should remain
      in the custody of AFOSI or 45 SFS/S2I until law enforcement purposes are served.
      6.4.2.2. Recovered stolen POVs will be released to the registered owner, unless held for
      evidentiary purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as
      appropriate.

      AFOSI or 45 SFS/S2I until the vehicle can be released to such authorities.
6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based on Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in
conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the
following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and
   crime–related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. A property search related to
   an investigation of criminal activity should not be conducted without search authority unless
   the item to be seized is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of
   criminal activity. When in doubt, proper search authority should be obtained before
   searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during either a traffic or
   criminal incident, or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and
   sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. This situation could also arise during
   cases of intoxicated driving or traffic accidents in which the operator is present but
   incapacitated or otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. If
   danger exists to the police or public or if there is risk of loss or destruction of evidence, an
   investigative type search of the vehicle may be conducted without search authority.
6.6. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. If a POV is impounded for evidentiary purposes, the vehicle can be held for as long as
   the evidentiary or law enforcement purpose exists. The vehicle must then be returned to the
   owner without delay unless directed otherwise by competent authority.
   6.6.2. If the vehicle is unclaimed after 120 days from the date notification was mailed to the
   last known owner or the owner released the vehicle by properly completing DD Form 2505,
   the vehicle will be disposed of by one of the following procedures:
      6.6.2.1. Release to the lienholder, if known.
      6.6.2.2. Process as abandoned property in accordance with DoD 4160.21–M.

         6.6.2.2.1. Property may not be disposed of until diligent effort has been made to find
         the owner; or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner.
         6.6.2.2.2. The diligent effort to find one of those mentioned in paragraph 6.6.1,

         other disposition, has been sent by certified or registered mail to that person at his or
         her last known address.
         6.6.2.2.5. When diligent effort to determine those mentioned above is unsuccessful,
         the property may be disposed of without delay, except that if it has a fair market value
         of more than $500, 45 SFS personnel may not dispose of the property until 45 days
         after the date it is received at the storage point.
  6.6.3. All contracts for the disposal of abandoned vehicles must comply with 10 USC 2575.
