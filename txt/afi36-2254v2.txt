SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change completely revises AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participation and
Training Procedures. It converts it back into an Instruction and breaks it out into Volumes.
Volume I covers Reserve Participation. Volume II covers Reserve Training. Volume III covers
Telecommuting/Advanced Distributed Learning. It changes the numbering to 36-2254 due to the
elimination of AFPD 36-80, Reserve Training and Education. Supplement 1 to AFMAN 36-
8001 is deleted with this AFI.

                                            Chapter 1

              SCHOOL AND ACTIVE DUTY FOR TRAINING (ADT) TOURS

1.1. Definition of ADT.
     1.1.1. Use ADT tours to supplement annual tour (AT) and inactive duty training (IDT) when
     the member requires additional training to achieve or maintain a required skill or skill level
     in their assigned Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Use active duty for operational support
     (ADOS) tours to provide direct staff support to Reserve Component programs.
     1.1.2. ADT tours may be used to maintain or increase the member's mobilization readiness
     in support of Reserve needs. Authorized ADT must provide a primary training content to the
     member during tours involving organized and planned specialized skill training, flight
     training, combat crew training, unit conversion training, refresher and proficiency training,
     officer acquisition training, professional development education programs, etc.
1.2. Eligibility for ADT.
     1.2.1. Only members in training categories A, B, F, J, and P (see AFI 36-22XX, Vol I,
     Reserve Personnel Participation, Table 2.1 and 2.2) authorized to take part in ADT tours.
     Fiscal year (FY) requirements will be performed, scheduled, substituted, or waived prior to a
     member performing an ADT (special) tour. On ADT (special) orders requests, the requester
     will place the statement ―All FY requirements of Table 1.1, of AFI 36-22XX, Volume I, have
     been performed, scheduled, substituted, or waived.‖ For selected reservists no tours of ADT
     (special)/military personnel appropriation (MPA) or reserve personnel appropriation
     (RPA)will be performed in the last quarter of the FY if the member’s FY requirements have
     not been met or scheduled.
     1.2.2. A member is not eligible to take part in ADT (other than formal schools) if:
        1.2.2.1. Member possesses 1-level Control AFSC.
        1.2.2.2. Member is within 6 months of mandatory discharge or retirement (school tours
        must meet retainability prescribed by Education and Training Course Announcements
        (ETCA) accessed at https://etca.randolph.af.mil and those identified in Chapter 3, para
        3.2.5.5).
        1.2.2.3. Member's enlistment expires before the end of the tour.
1.3. General Guidelines for ADT.
     1.3.1. Commanders or their designated representatives have the authority to determine the
     appropriate Training Category Codes (TCC) to be used for ADT tours and must make sure
     appropriate TCCs are placed on all ADT and ADOS orders. The TCCs are listed in
     Attachment 2.
     1.3.2. Reservists are allowed to participate in HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)-
     level or higher morale, welfare, and recreation events sanctioned by the Department of the
     Air Force. Permissive temporary duty (TDY) orders may be issued to participants on ADT
     in a non-pay, points only status at no appropriated fund cost to the government for events
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                          5


   which do not require selection by Air Force or a national governing body, but require active
   duty (AD) military status to participate.
       1.3.2.1. Permissive TDY, while at no appropriated fund cost to the government, will
       allow standby military travel and non-reimbursable lodging support. Travel from the
       member’s unit to the participation site is at member’s expense and is not reimbursable.
       For reservists who wish to participate in these programs, orders to ADT in non-pay,
       points only status must be approved by HQ AFRC/CV. TCC ―HA‖ applies. For athlete
       submission instructions, contact HQ AFRC/A1X. Selection will be on a case-by-case
       basis.
       1.3.2.2. It is also possible to place a reservist on ADT with pay status if that individual is
       selected to represent the AFRC in an Armed Forces National or International
       competition. For athlete submission instructions, contact HQ AFRC/A1. Selection will
       be on a case-by-case basis.
       1.3.2.3. Members will be selected by Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ
       USAF)/RE, to attend Interallied Confederation of Reserve Officers (CIOR)/Interallied
       Confederation of Reserve Medical Officers (CIORM) for logistical support. TCC ―HB‖
       applies. For reservists, HQ AFRC/A1 will notify the member’s unit commander for
       coordination and to have orders published for paid and permissive TDY.
   1.3.3. ADT tours will not be used in combination with other Reserve manday programs to
   include MPA for the same event. In other words, Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs),
   units, or agencies cannot circumvent manpower authorization levels through continuous
   manday application, using a combination on ADT and ADOS (RPA and MPA considered).
   For waiver process of MPA tours see AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA)
   Man-Day Program.
   1.3.4. Reservists on ADT for a period of time for which the training or requirement will
   overlap holidays or weekends, or includes mandated technical phase training, must be on
   continuous orders until completion of training or requirement. This does not negate the
   requirement for any necessary manday waiver authority.
1.4. Guidelines for Providing Formal School Training. The following are responsibilities for
providing formal school training and is applicable to all assigned AFRC members, including TR,
IMA, AGR, AD, ART’s (military/civilian status), and civilians:
   1.4.1. HQ AFRC formal training requirements are supported by active force schools. Unless
   specified by course owner, a Reserve member is eligible to attend the same classes as an
   active force member.
   1.4.2. Reserve quotas for schools conducted by Air Education and Training Command
   (AETC), other MAJCOMs, services, and government agencies are processed by HQ AFRC
   Formal School Branch. Individuals and units will NOT contact schools directly regarding
   availability of quotas, class dates, or other school information. Wings must contact HQ
   AFRC/A1, and IMAs must contact their RMG Program Manager (PM) for school
   information. Failure to work through appropriate training channels to obtain class seats could
   result in unauthorized travel with possibility of member being returned to home unit at unit
   expense.
 6                                                                 AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010


     1.4.3. HQ AFRC may also conduct selected courses from within their own resources,
     provided that validated and funded manpower authorizations are available to support these
     courses.
1.5. Scheduling ADT Tours. Under no circumstances should ADT be combined with IDT
solely for the purpose of providing travel expenses to the IDT location. Commanders and
supervisors should ensure that all ADT tours performed in conjunction with IDT can be
substantiated by a valid support or training requirement. Schedule ADT tours to conform with
the local duty hours. Tours are usually planned to coincide with the availability of training
supervisors, aircraft, or equipment. Generating an ADT tour primarily for taking a physical
examination is not authorized unless directed by a medical examination board.
     1.5.1. Reservists attending schools that are closed during the holiday season will remain in
     school tour status during the closedown period. Students will take leave, or remain at school
     and perform duties as required by the training organization. No travel orders for the purpose
     of taking leave will be issued. All AFRC students, regardless of status, will abide by specific
     guidance provided by the respective schools concerning dates of departure/return.
     1.5.2. Authorization to return to home unit must be on the original order or an amendment
     must be accomplished. Letters to the technical school liaisons will not be accepted.
        1.5.2.1. Students may request to return voluntarily to the Permanent Duty Station (PDS)
        to perform duty during the down time, if the PDS commander agrees and certifies there is
        suitable work for the member to perform at the PDS. Under no circumstances are units to
        recall any student. A recall action terminates enrollment and precludes the student’s
        return after the holiday period. Commanders may not direct the student to return home.
        1.5.2.2. Students must coordinate their absence with the appropriate school officials and
        give them a copy of their orders. Students must not depart earlier than, nor return later
        than, time authorized by school officials for their respective courses. Students must be
        aware of the limitation on travel allowances which are dependent upon individual
        circumstances.
        1.5.2.3. Military members attending school under TDY entitlements. These members
        are entitled to paid government travel based on a cost comparison of their per diem and
        travel/transportation expenses. They will receive the lesser of actual travel time and
        transportation expenses for the travel time only (constructed as most economical to the
        government), or the per diem they would have received had they remained at school. It is
        possible, therefore, for members to be responsible for paying a portion of their travel
        expenses if it exceeds the per diem they would have earned during the close-down.
        1.5.2.4. Military members attending school under Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
        entitlements. These members receive no per diem; therefore, there is no offset to cover
        any portion of their travel. They must pay any travel costs to return to the PDS to
        perform duty. The benefit for members in this category is the ability to return to the PDS
        without being charged leave.
        1.5.2.5. For civilians (including Air Reserve Technician (ARTs)) the same conditions
        apply as for military members under TDY entitlements.
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                         7


       1.5.2.6. It is the student's responsibility to seek clarification from the school travel pay
       office if unsure about his/her specific circumstances.
1.6. Travel. Travel restrictions are in Table 5.1 in AFI 36-2254, Volume I.
1.7. APPLICATIONS PROCEDURES: Application procedures for requesting formal
training, include ADT (School tours for traditional reserve members, AGR, civilian, ARTs
(military/civilian status). AF Form 101, Reserve Requirements for School Tours of Active Duty
for Training, will be submitted through respective wing training offices for TRs and ARTS in
military status.
   1.7.1. Requester will obtain verification that funds are available to support the request only if
   cours is not identified as centrally funded by HQ AFRC. Follow established HQ AFRC/FM
   procedures if additional unit funding is required for those courses not centrally funded.
   1.7.2. Servicing training offices will:
       1.7.2.1. Ensure applicants meet all course prerequisites and eligibility requirements, to
       include appropriate level of security clearance and physical exam requiremtns PRIOR to
       submission of training request.
       1.7.2.2. Request training courses through the currently established automated training
       system.
       1.7.2.3. Applications requiring a ―block/prerequisite‖ waiver, including ARTs, will not
       be input into the system until the waiver has been approved.
       1.7.2.4. Ensure all training line numbers (TLNs) are properly confirmed through
       automated system prior to class start date.
NOTE: DO NOT use automated systems to request quotas for AGRs, courses not included in
the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA).
       1.7.2.5. Request must include appropriate priority: 1 – if quota available; 3 – if quota
       NOT available, but required. Requests with incorrect priorities will be cancelled and
       must be reinput by requesting training office..
       1.7.2.6. When substitutions are necessary, follow established procedures.
1.8. Duration and Frequency of School Tours. The duration and frequency of school tours
are as follows:
   1.8.1. Course length, travel time, and accrued leave determines the duration of the tour.
   1.8.2. The frequency of attending school courses will be consistent with the need to maintain
   job proficiency in an individual's duty AFSC or with an approved retraining action. An
   individual selected by an approved school selection board to attend resident Developmental
   Education (DE) is exempt from this rule. A waiver to the FY limitation on course attendance
   may be granted if a school course is needed to keep or improve a member's mobilization
   readiness.
   1.8.3. The member should request a waiver through the unit of assignment for unit members
   or the RMG PM. It must be forwarded prior to selection to HQ AFRC/A1 or RMG/CC, or
   their designated representative, for approval.

1.9. Requesting ADT (Non School) tours:
     1.9.1. For mobilization assistants (general officer and colonels), the limit is determined by
     AF/RE each FY. Requests to exceed the limitation must be sent to AF/RESOMO.
     1.9.2. Send a copy of all special tour ADT orders on HQ AFRC commanders in general
     officer positions to HQ USAF/RESOMO.
1.10. School Tour Eligibility. A member takes part in a school tour to keep or increase
proficiency in the duty AFSC or wartime tasking. For enlisted members, school tours are
identified in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). This may include a school
tour to retrain a member to meet mobilization needs. A school tour applicant must:
     1.10.1. Meet all prerequisites for the course.
     1.10.2. Meet the medical standards in AFI 48-123, Volume 1, Medical Examinations and
     Standards Volume 1—General Provisions. Physical examinations for flying courses must be
     certified by HQ AFRC/SG before requesting a school tour allocation.
     1.10.3. Meet Air Force fitness standards (AFI 10-248, Fitness Program, as a prerequisite.
     Member must have current fitness score in the AF Portal. If member does not meet
     requirements, unit commander must request approval to attend from respective schoolhouse
     commander. Therefore, it is possible that member will not be allowed to attend formal
     course until such time fitness requirements are met.
     1.10.4. Reserve members must have retainability following graduation for all courses.
     Retainability is governed by ETCA, AFRC Guidelines. For DE, see AFI 36-2301,
     Professional Military Education.
1.11. Priorities for school training:
     1.11.1. HQ AFRC established a centralized process to fund many of the command formal
     schools, primarily Priorities 1 through 4. Central funding of RPA dollars is only for use by
     traditional reserve members or ARTs attending in military status. Centralized funding will
     continue throughout the execution year as long as funds are available. Courses, regardless of
     funding, are identified on the HQ AFRC/A1 CoP and includes such information as Priority,
     Central Funded (CF), Unit Funded (UF), AFSC, course title, TCC and servicing A1
     specialist. The training courses not centrally funded will be considered as unit funded and
     funding issues should be addressed prior to submission of school request to HQ AFRC/A1.
     Periodic review will be conducted to identify additional courses for central funding. Current
     priorities are:
        1.11.1.1. Initial skills courses (enlisted 3-level AFSC and officer AFSC awarding;
        enlisted/officer aircrew).
        1.11.1.2. AFSC sustainment courses. (5/7-level upgrade)
        1.11.1.3. Developmental Education (Enlisted/Officer).
        1.11.1.4. Essential courses affecting unit C-status.
     1.11.2. To help establish local unit funded school request priorities, commanders should
     establish an informal school committee to review and prioritize known training requirements.
     Review this list frequently to realign requirements based on available school funds.
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    9


   1.11.3. School tour requests are not to be turned down or canceled for lack of unit funds
   until all efforts have been exhausted to obtain additional funding. HQ AFRC/FM has
   established procedures for requesting unfunded requirements. Only when HQ AFRC/FM
   verifies funding is not available will training requests be denied.
   1.11.4. Prior to contacting HQ AFRC/A1 for quota cancellation, these procedures must be
   initiated. Written documentation, signed by the budget officer and the commander, will be
   submitted to HQ AFRC/A1 if a quota is canceled for lack of funding.
1.12. On-the-Job (OJT)/AFSC Training: Use OJT/AFSC training tours for reservists in their
Duty AFSCs, not for award of the 3-skill level. AFRC has established a centrally funded
―Seasoning Program‖ designed to build a ready force by allowing recent 3-Skill Level and
Initial/Mission Qualification aircrew formal school graduates to voluntarily remain on Active
Duty for Training orders until they have been trained via OJT. Mission qualified is defined as
being qualified to perform the tasks required at the current duty position. Specific
guidance/requirements on the Seasoning Training Program are located on the AFRC/A1 CoP.
1.13. Programming Requirements for School Tours.
   1.13.1. IMA school tour requirements are compiled by HQ AFRC/RMG.
   1.13.2. Unit formal school requirments will be identified annually by Unit/Wing/Numbered
   Air force (NAF)/Reserve Section (RS) using the web-based formal schools forecast tool.
   1.13.3. Each functional manager will have final approval of all requirements for the AFSCs
   they manage and confirms or adjusts the school requirements for their courses.
   1.13.4. Formal School Branch will ensure that all requirements are input into the automated
   system.
   1.13.5. School tours directly supporting a unit activation or conversion may precede the
   programmed activation or conversion date by 6 months.
1.14. Catastrophic or other Events:
   1.14.1. For Non-Prior Service (NPS): Respective training squadrons will maintain training
   integrity, to include continuation of member’s orders. Generally speaking, there will be no
   interruption in pipeline training; however, should an interruption occur, pipeline members
   will remain on Initial Active Duty Training orders to complete the required 84 days of
   training. HQ AFRC Formal School Branch will work with wing training and HQ AETC or
   respective course owner to ensure member’s reentry into formal course of instruction.
   1.14.2. For Prior Service: Generally, prior service personnel will be returned to their home
   unit with sufficient time to transition through the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and will
   then be removed from orders. HQ AFRC/A1, in concert with AETC or respective course
   owner, will provide timely instruction and updates to wing training offices or RMG training
   office on formal disposition of members, to include identification of processes for reentry
   into formal course.
 10                                                                AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010



1.15. Contracted Civilian Acquired Training (CCAT). CCAT is designed to increase the
number of mission-qualified individuals in the Reserve components. It is an alternative to
proficiency training and must be directly related to specific individual mobilization skill
requirements. CCAT applies to both to AFSC awarding training and sustainment training.
CCAT is an option for a formal school request.
   1.15.1. Contract training is authorized when it is demonstrated that such training fulfills all
   military requirements, is less costly,and military service school quotas have been requested,
   but are not available to satisfy an identified training requirement specified by the military
   service concerned.
   1.15.2. Only fully accredited civilian institutions and industries may be used for CCAT.
   Observe all existing laws and regulations on contracting from non-DoD sources.
   1.15.3. HQ AFRC functional managers will initiate requests to establish CCAT, when
   warranted. As a minimum, the functional manager should define the size and type of the
   population to be trained, the skills to be obtained, and the proposed source of the training.
   1.15.4. Command functional managers will maintain records reflecting cost per student hour,
   name of institution, and number of students trained per FY for each of their CCAT programs.
   1.15.5. Special Restrictions on Utilization of RPA Special Tours in Conjunction With
   Commercial or Contract Activities. When OJT or proficiency training is available only
   through participation with a commercial, contract activity:
       1.15.5.1. Conduct the training under the supervision of a qualified trainer designated by
       the applicable performance work statement.
       1.15.5.2. The appropriate military organization responsible for the functional area
       supported by the performance work statement requests special tours.
1.16. ART Attendance to Schools. (primarily pertains to ART personnel; however, policy
will pertain to TR, AGR, and civilian when annotated with ―*‖)
   1.16.1. General Guidance:
       1.16.1.1. Each ART position is identified with a Reserve position which is identical, or
       so closely related as to require substantially the same basic knowledge and skills in either
       position. Accordingly, ARTs will attend schools and training courses in civilian status,
       except as otherwise noted.
       1.16.1.2. When attending training courses in civilian status, the appropriate civilian attire
       for the course of instruction will be worn. However, members are encouraged to wear
       the military uniform. Some courses may require the wearing of ―special‖ equipment and,
       regardless of status, all attendees will abide by these requirements, to include physical
       fitness requirements. (* TR, AGR, Civilian)
       1.16.1.3. ARTs traveling in a civilian capacity, must include both the military and
       civilian grade on their orders. ARTs will be housed according to their military grade.
       1.16.1.4. A statement addressing the member’s compliance with physical fitness testing,
       with specified date, must be included in the remarks section of the school order.
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       11


     1.16.1.5. HQ AFRC functional managers will identify those courses requiring mandatory
     attendance in military status. Specific courses will be identified on the A1 web site.
     1.16.1.6. Individuals requesting attendance in civilian status will complete SF 182,
     Request, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training, and according to
     local procedures, will forward through the wing training office, if applicable, to the
     appropriate servicing civilian training office for processing. Only requests coordinated
     through the servicing office will be accepted by HQ AFRC/A1TF. Request received
     directly from units/squadrons or individual members will not be processed.The individual
     status will be determined prior to submission of the training request. *AGRs will submit
     SF182, not AF 101, through appropriate channels for further submission to AFRC/A1.
         1.16.1.6.1. Formal schools are those listed in ETCA. The majority of these schools
         are processed through the automated training system and a Training Line Number
         (TLN) is generated.
         1.16.1.6.2. The servicing civilian training office is responsible for reviewing and
         approving all requests for training according to regulatory, statutory, and legal
         requirements.
         1.16.1.6.3. AF IMT 101, Reserve Requirements for School Tours of Active Duty
         for Training, will not be used to request courses in civilian status.
         1.16.1.6.4. ARTs will not use a civilian training quota/TLN to attend in military
         status or use a military quota to attend in civilian status.
         1.16.1.6.5. Individuals will not submit duplicate requests through military channels
         requesting the same course/class. The individual status will be determined prior to
         submission of the training request.
     1.16.1.7. Members (*TRs and ARTs in military status) cannot use AT to satisfy formal
     school training requirements.
     1.16.1.8. Members attending courses in civilian status will begin and remain in that
     status during the duration of the training. Switching status is not authorized (i.e., civilian
     status 1 week/military status the next/back to civilian status).
     1.16.1.9. ARTs, regardless of status (military or civilian), will NOT continue to meet
     flying operations requirements while they are attending resident formal training,
     including members attending courses colocated with unit of assignment. This restriction
     will allow the member to remain focused on the academic rigors of the institution they
     are attending.
  1.16.2. Each FY, HQ AFRC is given a number of AETC funded quotas (bogeys). AETC
  fund cites are used for travel/per diem; there is no tuition cost for formal schools. However,
  the number of bogeys available each year does not remain constant. Bogeys are not used for
  flying, Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), Air University, Medical, Survival, or
  command specific (Air Mobility Command, Air Combat Command, ANG, etc.) training
  courses.
     1.16.2.1. When funded quotas are available for use, ARTs must attend formal schools in
     civilian status.
12                                                             AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010


         1.16.2.1.1. When ―bogeys‖ are not available for use, the commanders can approve
         the exceptions to attend in military status. For NAF commanders, this authority may
         be delegated to the RSG/CC for ARTs assigned at NAF level. The 951 RPTS/CC
         will approve all requests for ARTs assigned to HQ AFRC.
         1.16.2.1.2. ARTs attending school in civilian status will abide by all appropriate
         guidelines/rules established by the school, and required of all students.
     1.16.2.2. AFIT normally funds the travel/per diem for civilian students, therefore ARTs
     will also be required to attend their courses in civilian status.
     1.16.2.3. Short notice cancellations (those turned in within 10 days or less) and no-shows
     will be documented in writing, signed by the commander and forwarded through the
     training office to HQ AFRC/A1TF. (*also applicable to AGR, TR and civilians)
  1.16.3. Funding Guidance. When ARTs attend schools in civilian status, Operations and
  Maintenance (O&M) funds are utilized. If military status, RPA school tour (project 726)
  funds are used. Note that there are no tuition costs associated with formal schools.
  1.16.4. Tuition Assistance. (Civilians and ARTs only)
     1.16.4.1. As a civilian employee, tuition assistance may be available under the local
     tuition assistance policy at each respective base. Local O&M (unit) funds are used.
     Where a unit is a tenant at an AD base, the funding remains a reserve wing/ unit
     responsibility. However, TA is not provided, in whole or part, for courses which the
     employee is receiving other federal or state tuition subsidies such as VA educational
     benefits, scholarships or grants, etc.
     1.16.4.2. For those ARTs registered in an Air Force civilian career program (other than
     the ART Officer Career Program), it may be possible to obtain tuition assistance through
     that means.
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   13


                                         Chapter 2

 RESIDENT DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION (DE) ATTENDANCE OF AIR FORCE
                  SELECTED RESERVE MEMBERS

2.1. Resident DE. Selected Reserve members eligible for resident DE include unit assigned
members, ARTs, IMAs, and Active Guard Reserve (AGR) members.
2.2. General Policy for DE. DE is a requirement for promotion for enlisted personnel. AFI 36-
2502, Airman Promotion Program, Table 4.1, contains DE requirements for enlisted personnel
and AFI 36-2301, Table 5, contains DE eligibility criteria. Officers should complete the
appropriate level of DE commensurate with their grade. Completion may be by the resident,
correspondence, seminar method, or distance learning.
   2.2.1. Due to the unique constraints confronting Reserve officers, few will attend DE in
   residence. Therefore, each Reserve officer may complete DE through non-resident methods.
   2.2.2. Reserve members who attend DE in residence must be in a military duty status to
   receive point credit for attendance. However, Reserve members attending in civilian status
   will receive credit as having completed resident DE, once their military grade has met
   military grade criteria for enrollment/attendance for the respective level of DE. Civilian
   completion of DE prior to obtaining prerequisite military grade will prompt completion to be
   masked in the promotion system.
   2.2.3. Non-resident completion of DE will not affect eligibility for resident attendance.
   However, AF Reserve members, who have not attended an AF recognized DE in-residence
   course may not register for another Service’s non-resident DE until they have completed the
   appropriate level of non-resident Air Force DE. See AFI 36-2301, Chapter 3 for guidance on
   DE Credit.
   2.2.4. Non-completion or elimination from a DE School. When eliminating or disenrolling
   an Air Force reservist from a DE school for any reason, the procedures outlined in ETCA
   that can only be accessed at https://etca.randolph.af.mil, apply. The school sends a copy of
   the faculty board proceedings to HQ AFRC/RMG for IMAs, to HQ AFRC/A1 for unit
   assigned members, and HQ USAF/REAMO for AGRs with a copy to HQ USAF/REP.
   2.2.5. DE Attendance Agreement. Prior to attending resident DE, all Reserve attendees
   must sign a Student Attendance Agreement. Attachment 3 of this AFI contains an example
   of the required attendance agreement. Failure to sign this agreement will negate the
   members opportunity to attend the respective DE residence course. This agreement will be
   completed upon notification of selection.
   2.2.6. HQ AF/REP will obtain annual DE quotas from HQ USAF/A1. Quotas will be
   reviewed and forwarded to HQ ARPC/DP and AFRC/A1.
   2.2.7. DE Credit for Schools Attended/Completed in Other Services. Air Force Reserve
   members are authorized to attend or complete other service DE after first completing the
   comparable level of Air Force DE (exception for those members selected by the Reserve
   Developmental Education Designation Board (RDEDB) to attend other service schools).
   Members accessed into the Air Force Reserve from other services will receive creditable
   recognition for having completed DE in their former service. However, this only includes
 14                                                             AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010


   Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE) and Senior Developmental Education (SDE)
   for officers, and Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy for enlisted members
   transferred from Army, Navy, and Coast Guard. DE for company grade officers must be
   satisfied through Air Force Squadron Officers School (SOS). For enlisted members NCO
   Academy and Airmen Leadership School (ALS) must also be satisfied through Air Force
   instruction. Members are not authorized to negotiate quotas directly with other service
   schools offering DE, and any DE completed by using such means will not be creditable for
   promotion consideration.
2.3. Officer DE.
   2.3.1. General Information and Policy.        Reserve officers should complete Basic
   Developmental Education (BDE), IDE, and SDE during their careers. Table 2.1 shows
   phases for completing the DE resident courses. SDE graduates should receive consideration
   for follow-on assignments commensurate with the advanced education received.
   2.3.2. Eligibility. An officer is eligible to attend resident DE under the criteria stated in
   Table 2.1 and Attachment 10. Additional eligibility requirements for select IDE and SDE
   courses can be found in Attachment 8.
   2.3.3. RPA is centrally funded for Reserve officers attending in military status. ARTs who
   attend in civilian status will be funded by unit O&M. Note: Unit O&M funds will also be
   used to fund AGR’s travel and per diem.
   2.3.4. BDE.
      2.3.4.1. Air and Space Basic Course (ASBC). See Air University’s ASBC home page at
      http://www.au.af.mil/au/soc/asbc for course details. ASBC is considered BDE for
      Regular Air Force line officers. However, due to the limited number of quotas provided
      to the Air Reserve Component (ARC), ASBC is not mandated to ARC officers at this
      time, but strictly of a voluntary nature. ASBC graduates remain in their current
      assignments.
      2.3.4.2. SOS. Education and Training Course Announcements information can be
      accessed at https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
      2.3.4.3. How to Apply. Personnel (to include unit AGRs) submit their requests to their
      MPF. The MPF will submit unit request through the current automated system (unit
      AGRs must submit a SF 182. For centrally managed programs, the PM will obtain
      concurrence with the member’s functional manager prior to forwarding the application to
      RMG/DP. IMAs apply in writing through their approving official to the PM. The RMG
      PM will forward to HQ ARPC/DP by established suspense date. HQ AGR officers who
      wish to attend should submit a request in writing to HQ USAF/REAMO, 90 days before
      class start date. Due to the purpose individuals are brought on to Limited Period Recall
      Program (LPRP)/Limited Extended Active Duty (LEAD) (see AFI 36-2008, Voluntary
      Extended Active Duty (EAD) for Air Reserve Commissioned Officers, it would not be
      feasible for reservists serving under these conditions to apply for resident DE.
      Individuals on LPRP/LEAD should complete DE through seminar or correspondence.
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    15


     2.3.4.4. Waiver of Eligibility Criteria. All waiver requests for unit personnel must be
     submitted through HQ AFRC/A1 prior to course administrator input. IMAs requesting a
     waiver of eligibility criteria must submit a letter of justification with the application
     through their approving official to the RMG PM who will forward to RMG/CC.
     2.3.4.5. Selection of Students. HQ ARPC/DP convenes a selection board to select IMA
     candidates. Unit nominees (including unit AGR) are selected at wing level. HQ AGRs.
     2.3.4.6. Announcement of Selections/Nonselections. HQ ARPC/DP notifies RMG/CC
     or designated representative of IMA results. Unit nominees will be notified by wing
     training. HQ AGRs will be notified by HQ USAF/REAMO.
     2.3.4.7. Removal or cancellations. Unit members request removal in writing through
     their unit commander, wing training office, to HQ AFRC/A1 not later than 45 days prior
     to class start date. IMAs request removal in writing through their approving official to
     the RMG PM. The RMG PM will forward to RMG/CC or designated representative.
     RMG will notify HQ ARPC/DP. Letters of cancellation must have justification to enable
     a determination as to whether the member should be removed with or without prejudice.
  2.3.5. IDE/SDE.
     2.3.5.1. Applicants. Applicants are either invitees or other applicants. Invitees are the
     top 20 percent (based upon promotion order of merit) of the mandatory candidates, and
     all position vacancy promotion selectees to major (for IDE) and lieutenant colonel (for
     SDE). In addition to invitees, member’s senior rater may nominate other applicants. A
     Senior Rater is defined by AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems,
     Chapter 3. Note: Members selected by a Special Selection Board are not considered top
     20.
     2.3.5.2. Invitees. After the public release dates of the major and lieutenant colonel
     selection boards, invitees will receive letters of invitation (signed by AF/RE). The letter
     of invitation will be applicable for any year of application to the RDEDB for which the
     member is eligible until they are no longer eligible for that level of DE commensurate
     with ther invitation letter. See Table 2.1, Note 6.
     2.3.5.3. HQ AFPC/DPAF will publicize the RDEDB Invitation Announcement with
     RDEDB convening dates, nomination suspenses and POC information.
     2.3.5.4. Applying. All IDE and SDE applications are initiated by the member through
     the rater to the member’s senior rater and submitted to HQ ARPC/DP by the RDEDB
     Invitation Announcement suspense date. Late applications will not be accepted. See
     Attachment 4 for Submission Process and Attachments 7 and 8 for application
     requirements.
        2.3.5.4.1. Waiver requests. The applicant requesting a waiver of eligibility criteria
        must submit a letter of justification with the application. The RDEDB will evaluate
        all waivers for approval; final determination rests with the RDEDB President.
        2.3.5.4.2. Senior Rater. Senior raters (as defined in AFI 36-2406), will rank order all
        their nominees(similar to the promotion recommendations process)in each
        nomination category (IDE or SDE), i.e, 2/5 mean that the officer is ranked number 2
        out of 5 applying. It is also paramount that Senior Rater comments reflect how the
16                                                            AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010


         Air Force can benefit from the member’s attendance at IDE or SDE. Applications not
         meeting these requirements will be returned through appropriate channels.
  2.3.6. RDEDB.
     2.3.6.1. The Board President is the Deputy to the Chief of Air Force Reserve or designee
     (must be a general officer). The membership of the board is comprised of five colonels
     or above; AF/REP is a permanent member. The Board also consists of one member from
     each of the following programs: Unit Program; IMA Program; HQ AFRC Career
     Management Board representive; and AGR Program (rotated between HQ USAF/RE,
     HQ ARPC, and HQ AFRC). HQ ARPC/DPAF solicits for, and recommends board
     members to RDEDB President through AF/REP, who will notify HQ ARPC/DP of
     approval. HQ ARPC/DP notifies all board members of their appointments and
     coordinates with HQ ARPC/CCP for all travel and billeting arrangements. Each board
     member must have completed SDE, preferably in residence. HQ ARPC also invites HQ
     AU/RF and support staff members to the board as a nonvoting technical advisors (HQ
     USAF/REP and HQ AFRC/A1).
     2.3.6.2. HQ ARPC/DP reviews all nomination packages for eligibility and completeness
     and serves as the RDEDB secretariat.
     2.3.6.3. The RDEDB screens all officers identified as eligible and determines those most
     qualified to attend based upon the whole-person concept and consideration of the future
     needs of the Air Force. The RDEDB will identify Selects (aligns with schools) and
     Alternates.
  2.3.7. Post Board responsibilities. HQ ARPC will:
     2.3.7.1. Prepare and staff a package through AF/REP to AF/RE for approval to include
     an AF/RE message for public release and attachments that identify RDEDB
     recommendations, the package should include: 1) Names of Selects and school
     recommended; 2) Alternates; and Non-Selects.
     2.3.7.2. Produce statistical summary of the RDEDB proceedings, to include: quotas,
     application trends, Reserve Category details, gender and race.
     2.3.7.3. Close-hold Message Release. Send a ―For Official Use Only‖ message to all
     MPFs (copy to AF/REP) prior to the public release of the message. This message is only
     available to MPFs and directs the MPFs to notify each senior rater and commander of
     their nominees’ status (select, alternate or non-select). Commanders should notify their
     nominees of their status on the public release date. No organization or individual will
     publicly display or release any select, alternate or nonselect list at any time. A
     simultaneous separate notification will go to AF/REP, HQ AFRC/A1, HQ AFRC/RMG
     advising them that the close-hold message has been sent to the MPFs. This allows them
     to alert commanders and particularly PM to prompt MPFs to act on the message.
     2.3.7.4. Public Release. Publish the AF/RE Public Message, Selects (with their schools)
     and Alternates (in accordance with the Privacy Act) on the ARPC web site on the public
     release date. Non-select lists will not be made public at any time.
     2.3.7.5. Publish an electronic message notifying School Commandants of the RDEDB

      2.3.7.8. Commanders may send the optional letter of acknowledgement (located at
      Attachment 5) to Selected member’s employer.
   2.3.8. Change in medical profile – IDE/SDE Selects are required to immediately notify their
   Senior Raters and HQ ARPC/DP if there is any change in their medical profile (regardless of
   whether this changes the member’s eligibility to attend school).
   2.3.9. Removal from a DE Selection List.
      2.3.9.1. In accordance with AFI 36-2301 the Management Level may remove an officer
      from DE Selection List for cause; if so member is no longer eligible for DE in-residence
      during their window of eligibility.
      2.3.9.2. Commander may request an operational withdrawal for an officer on the DE
      Selection List, or with the member’s concurrence, request a deferral to the following
      Semester (if permitted by the School and budgetary constraints) or to the following
      Academic Year. Given the limited number of DE seats available to the Air Force
      Reserve, deferrals will be afforded based on the needs of the Air Force Reserve and
      approved deferrals do not guarantee re-selection for the same school.
      2.3.9.3. Officers selected for DE may decline but do so with prejudice unless they can
      cite humanitarian or other non-prejudicial reasons. Deferral requests for other than
      operational reasons will be considered on a case by case basis. Officers withdrawn with
      prejudice may be precluded from competing for current level of DE in-residence;
      decision is at the discretion of the AF/RE Deputy.
      2.3.9.4. Requests for withdrawals are submitted from the individual officer through
      his/her Senior Rater directly to HQ ARPC/DPAF (certified e-mail is permitted).
      Timeliness impacts approval/disapproval status and ability to utilize an Alternate. HQ
      ARPC/DP will recommend appropriate Alternate(s) to replace the member withdrawing
      and forward the request to AF/REP, who evaluates the request and recommends approval
      (with or without prejudice)/disapproval to HQ USAF/RE Deputy (RDEDB President).
      AF/REP will make written notification of RE Deputy decision to HQ ARPC/DP. HQ
      ARPC/DP will: 1) Update Master DE Select list, 2) Inform HQ AFRC/RMG,
      AF/REAMO or HQ AFRC/A1 (as appropriate) to notify new Select by phone; and 3)
      Send written notification to new Select.

                 THE AIR FORCE RESERVE RETRAINING PROGRAM

3.1. Air Force Reserve Retraining Program. The purpose of the Air Force Reserve
Retraining Program is to assist in achieving and maintaining the level of trained personnel
resources required to meet Air Force Reserve mission requirements. The program allows
eligible airmen a choice of career fields from which to pursue an Air Force career and provides a
method to return airmen disqualified from their current AFSC to a productive status. Continuous
efforts must be made to eliminate unprogrammed overages and overgrades and fill positions
through recruitment, accessions, leveling, and both voluntary and involuntary retraining.
3.2. Types of Retraining for Unit Program.
   3.2.1. Voluntary Retraining:
       3.2.1.1. An application initiated by an eligible airman into a chosen specialty where there
       is a retraining need and mandatory requirements and quality standards are met.
       3.2.1.2. Eligibility:
           3.2.1.2.1. All Personnel, including ARTs, must meet retraining AFSC entry
           requirements of AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Enlisted),
           and AFECD (Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory), and must be in compliance
           with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel and AFI
           10-248.
           3.2.1.2.2. Retraining must be into an AFSC manned at less than 100 percent or into
           an AFSC that is authorized to have overages. Wing commanders may deviate from
           this requirement to meet manning levels and mission needs in accordance with HQ
           AFRC/CV FY manning policy.
           3.2.1.2.3. Personnel must have or attain at least 36 months retainability to voluntarily
           retrain. If additional retainability is required to meet requirement in Education and
           Training Course Announcements (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/specifications),
           obtain it prior to attending technical school.
           3.2.1.2.4. Personnel are ineligible for voluntary retraining for at least 24 months after
           completion of technical training and being awarded the Journeyman skill level. Prior
           retrainees must also acquire a skill level commensurate with the skill level of the
           AFSC from which they previously retrained. Unit commanders can make exceptions
           for humanitarian reasons and for those members who two-time fail their Career
           Development Course/End of Course exam.
           3.2.1.2.5. Personnel must not be retraining out of a shortage or critical AFSC.
           Wing/RMG/CC, or designated representative, may deviate from this requirement to
           meet manning levels and mission needs. Develop local policy in accordance with
           local needs, budget, and mission.
           3.2.1.2.6. Prior service accessions with an awarded/convertible AFSC will only be
           retrained into another AFSC when the AFSC previously held is not authorized or
AFI 36-2254V2 9 JUNE 2010                                                                  23


         there is no vacancy/authorization in their current AFSC. Wing/RMG/CC, or
         designated representative, may deviate from this requirement to meet manning levels
         and mission needs in accordance with HQ AFRC/CV FY manning policy. Develop
         local policy in accordance with local needs, budget, and mission.
         3.2.1.2.7. Prior service personnel who are not in retraining and NPS members must
         remain in the AFSC for at least 24 months upon completion of technical training and
         acquire the Journeyman skill level to be eligible for retraining.
         3.2.1.2.8. A prior service accession from another service, with a military specialty
         that does not convert to an AFSC is not considered to be in a retraining status;
         however, member must attend technical school within 12 months.
         3.2.1.2.9. Mobilized personnel and personnel in a Stop Loss AFSC are ineligible to
         apply for retraining. Waivers will not be accepted.
         3.2.1.2.10. Personnel who have been convicted of a ―misdemeanor crime of domestic
         violence‖ may only cross-flow/retrain into an AFSC that doesn’t have a requirement
         to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms or ammunition. Refer questions
         concerning the Lautenberg Amendment policy to the local Staff Judge Advocate.
  3.2.2. Involuntary Retraining:
     3.2.2.1. Action initiated by unit commander or designated representative to determine the
     disposition of personnel who become overages due to locally generated unit manning
     document (UMD) reductions/changes, force structure changes, crew ratio reduction,
     medical unit type code (UTC) reduction, or weapons system conversions, withdrawal of
     an AFSC because of medical disqualification, or the inability of a member to maintain
     currency requirements for flying status.
     3.2.2.2. Involuntary retraining is primarily for the benefit of the Air Force Reserve and
     does not require the concurrence of the member.
     3.2.2.3. Retraining application (AF IMT 3920, Request for Reservist Voluntary
     Retraining), is not required.
