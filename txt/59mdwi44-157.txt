  4.1. Housekeeping. Refer to IPCG.
     4.1.1. The ICF reviews housekeeping policies, procedures, and cleaning agents annually.
     4.1.2. Flight commanders and section managers ensure housekeeping personnel are
     appropriately informed of any patient with infectious or communicable disease.
     4.1.3. Customers conduct routine monitoring of their areas to monitor for cleanliness.
     Observed deficiencies are reported to the Zone Master of the area or the housekeeping
     Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE). Do NOT send complaint forms through distribution
     or directly to housekeeping but hand carry to the QAE. Do not contact the contractor or
     housekeeping personnel directly to report lapses in contract performance, except for
     emergency services.
     4.1.4. Emergency Service Response Procedures. A blood or body fluid spill is
     considered an emergency. The HCW should cordon off the area to prevent slipping or
     spreading of the spill, then call housekeeping to provide an emergency response.
     Housekeeping will respond within 10 minutes. For housekeeping emergency service, call
     292-5985, or 59 MDW pager 594-6217. If housekeeping does not respond, notify the
     Medical Control Center at 292-5990 and follow the same reporting procedure.
     4.1.5. Housekeeper will clean all government owned property and equipment unless
     attached to a patient or specified in the Individual Medical Facility Exhibit as not to be
     cleaned.
  4.2. Linen. Procedures are IAW 59MDWI 23-101, Linen Supply Procedure and AFI 44-
  108. Clean linen is stored away from direct patient care areas to minimize microbial
  contamination. Place clean linen in, 1) a cart with a secure cover (disposable plastic or clean
  reusable material), 2) a covered linen rack, or 3) a closet or cabinet dedicated for clean linen
  only. Clean linen remains covered until point of use. A 24-hour supply of linen may be
  unwrapped in user areas.
     4.2.1. Shelves. Refer to ICPG. Place a Plexiglas-type liner at the bottom of nonsolid
     shelves and racks or place supplies in bins if there is no liner.
  4.3. Environmental Cleanliness. Managers are responsible to ensure cleanliness of those
  areas not under contractual Housekeeping Service.
     4.3.1. Use ICF Approved List of Environmental Disinfectants for all cleaning and
     disinfecting. Refer to Attachment 2, Approved Antiseptics and Disinfectants for

         4.3.5.1. Examination Rooms. A clean sheet, towel, blanket, or exam paper is used
         for each patient. The examination table is cleaned after each patient with a facility
         approved disinfectant. Terminal cleaning is performed daily by housekeeping. When
         used for isolation, the exam room must be terminally cleaned after patient discharge.
  4.4. Insect and Rodent Information. Report insect and rodent infestations within the 59
  MDW to Civil Engineering (CE) Services, 292-7377.
  4.5. Solid and Contaminated Waste Management IAW IPCG. The ICF has an evaluative
  and consultative role, rather than operational responsibility. Individuals using area must
  designate location for the placement of contaminated waste containers and ensure the trash
  and biohazardous waste are routinely picked up by housekeeping personnel. Reusable waste
  receptacles are routinely cleaned by housekeeping personnel and relined with fresh plastic
  liners.   Report to Facility Management (292-7171) any specific discrepancies or
  noncompliance issues.

     actions and surveillance is an integrated effort from Facility Management, 59 MDW
     Safety and CE. Executive oversight is maintained through the Facilities and
     Environment Committee (FEC) and the Board of Directors. The ICO is the primary
     responsible office for conducting the Infection Control Risk Assessment and Permit with
     the assistance of Facility Management and CE.
 12                                                              59MDWI44-157 23 MAY 2013


       4.10.2. The multidisciplinary team will evaluate and analyze construction, demolition or
       remodeling projects that may impact 59 MDW environmental reservoirs to determine
       appropriate IICMs. Once the IICMs are established, Facility Management conducts
       ongoing surveillance until the project is complete. Status of IICMs will be briefed at the
       FEC and ICF meetings.
5. Isolation and Precautions. Refer to IPCG for specifics.
   5.1. Surgeries will no longer be done on patients that are on droplet/ airborne precaution.
   Only patients on contact precaution will recover in a designated area within the PACU.
   5.2. Transmission Based Isolation. Patients screened with communicable disease will be
   placed on isolation as soon as possible and not be left in the clinic waiting room. In the clinic
   setting, Contact Precautions are not required to be used on patients known to have a MDRO
   unless patient has a draining wound that is not covered/cannot be contained or the patient has
   diarrhea.
The designated transmission based isolation visual aid (VA) sign will be posted on the door of
the clinic’s exam/treatment room (59MDWVA 44-101, Contact Isolation, 59MDWVA 44-102,
Droplets Precaution, 59MDWVA 44-103, Airborne Precautions). Personnel, patients’ family
and patients are required to read and comply with the stated directions. When the patient leaves
the area, the sign is left in place until housekeeping or HCW completes cleaning of the room.
       5.2.1. The patient is restricted to the room during isolation. Deviations from this policy
       must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the ICO. If the patient must leave the room
       for a necessary ordered medical procedure, the sending clinic or unit [e.g. Same Day
       Surgery (SDS)] must instruct the receiving unit of the type of precautions currently being
       used prior to transport and patient must be instructed on ways by which they can assist in
       preventing the transmission of their infectious microorganism to others.
       5.2.2. Transporting Patients. The patient is changed into a clean patient gown/covered
       with a clean sheet (if applicable). Volunteers or students without their preceptor will not
       transport these patients. The use of PPE by the patient and staff is according to Table 5.1.
       Maximum Barrier Precautions for Patient Transport.
       5.2.3. The sending unit (e.g. SDS) or clinic and receiving area will coordinate when the
       patient will be sent for the procedure or test. The isolation patient will be taken directly
       to the procedure room and not left unaccompanied and never in a community waiting
       area. The sending unit/clinic personnel will wait for the patient unless arrangements have
       been made by the receiving area to call when the procedure is over.

APPROVED ANTISEPTICS AND DISINFECTANTS FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS
                               USE

A2.1. The Food and Drug Administration approved products are intended for use on human skin
or superficial tissue. The National Drug Code usually identifies these products. An example is
an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate.
A2.2. Environmental Protection Agency approved products are intended for use on “things”
(inanimate objects). An example is a disinfectant such as phenolic product.
A2.3. Antiseptic is a chemical germicide formulated for use on skin or tissue. With the
exception of alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, antiseptics are not used to decontaminate animate
objects.
A2.4. Disinfectant is a germicide that inactivates virtually all recognized pathogenic
microorganisms, but not necessarily all microbial forms (i.e. bacterial endospores) on inanimate
objects.
A2.5. New products or substitutions. Submit a request to the ICF for approval before purchase.
Once approved, a request must be submitted to Logistics for approval of the new product or the
substitution.
A2.6. Safety.    PPE will be worn in handling any product per the manufacturers’
recommendations. Refer to Material Safety Data Sheet for product information. The following
tables were updated with products listed in section specific operating instructions.

      PATIENTS COLONIZED OR INFECTED WITH MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT
                         ORGANISMS (MDROS)

A4.1. Bacterial resistance has evolved in both the hospital and community, resulting in some
bacteria that are resistant to the majority of currently available antibiotics. Patients colonized
with MDRO may develop invasive infections with those organisms. Strategies to control the
spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens include: 1) improving antibiotic prescribing practices in
order to reduce the selection of antibiotic resistant genes, and 2) scrupulous infection control
practices that include adherence to hand hygiene and isolation procedures. MDROs targeted for
control in healthcare facilities include:
   A4.1.1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
   A4.1.2. Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
   A4.1.3. Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
   A4.1.4. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
   A4.1.5. Multi-drug Resistant (MDR) Streptococcus pneumoniae.
   A4.1.6. MDR gram negative bacteria. Organisms that may require isolation at 59 MDW,
   depending upon their antibiotic resistance/susceptibility pattern include:
       A4.1.6.1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
       A4.1.6.2. Escherichia coli.
       A4.1.6.3. Klebsiella pneumoniae.
