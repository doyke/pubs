AFI 32-7086, 1 November 2004, is supplemented as follows: This supplement applies to all
United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) personnel who authorize, procure, issue, use, or
dispose of hazardous materials (HM) in the course of their official duties; and to those who
manage, monitor, or track any of the preceding processes, whether the processes are performed
by government or contractor personnel. This supplement fulfills the requirement for major
command (MAJCOM) supplements as noted in paragraph 1.10.2.1. of the parent Air Force
Instruction (AFI). It adds requirements needed because of European laws and regulations and
where additional management of HM is desired. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) units. This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG). Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

Summary of Changes

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
updates AFI 32-7086_USAFESUP, Hazardous Material Management, dated 2 March 2007.
This revised USAFE Supplement includes updates to ozone depleting substance handling
requirements and a new section mandating the appointment of unit environmental coordinators
(Chapter 2).

2.4.9.1. (Added) The process adopted by the Hazardous Material Management Process
(HMMP) team shall be issued in writing to all parties involved in the HMMP.
2.5.3.1.9. Work area supervisors shall provide copies of their completed AF Form 3952,
Chemical Hazardous Material Request/Authorization to their unit Safety representative and their
Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC) for informational purposes.
2.5.3.1.10. (Added) Approval for purchasing non-standard pesticides. The Armed Forces Pest
Management Board (AFPMB) provides a list of standard pesticides complete with National
Stock Number (NSN) to all Air Force entomology and pest shops. AFI 32-1053, Integrated Pest
Management Program, Paragraph 4.5.1.3. requires Command approval for all non-standard
pesticide purchase and use. All requests must be made by a certified pesticide applicator at the
installation on a USAFE Form 132, Request for Non-Standard Pesticide Approval, and sent to
the USAFE Command Entomologist for approval prior to obtaining and/or using the pesticide.
The request must include applicator, pesticide, and targeted pest information. For non-standard
pesticides, environmental approval on the AF Form 3952, Chemical Hazardous Material
Request/ Authorization is contingent upon a Command Entomologist-approved request. This
approved request will be electronically added to the authorization to maintain a record. If the
method of procurement is through base supply, AFI 32-1053, paragraph 4.5.2. requires that
advice code “2B” is used on the ordering documents so that supply may not substitute the
pesticide with another material.
2.5.5.2.1.1. (Added) The Contracting Office shall request Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)
in English and the native language for the country where they will be used.
2.5.6.2.1. (Added) Government Wide Purchase Card (GPC) purchased HM must be processed
to the same level of completeness as HM procured through the facility or location where
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) is currently managed (HAZMART). This includes issuance of
tracking labels or alternate procedure approved by the Installation HMMP Team as mentioned in
paragraph 2.4.9. To avoid additional transportation of HM, installations may allow the use of
invoices for issuance of tracking labels. The invoices and MSDSs will be taken to the
HAZMART for tracking processing. The invoices will be marked with the tracking label
numbers to ensure proper placement of labels on the specific material purchased under that
invoice. All HM must have proper tracking and authorization documentation.
2.7.2.1. (Added) Prior to transportation of HM to, from, or within locations outside the
Continental United States (OCONUS), personnel will ensure compliance with applicable local
laws. Contact should be made with the Traffic Management Flight and the installations
Dangerous Goods Advisor for the safe handling, packaging, and transportation of hazardous
material.
2.10.5.8.1. (Added) Although safety (SE) and bioenvironmental engineering (BE) reviews for
contractor used HM is “for information purposes only” and is not deemed an approval, they must
complete all actions needed to allow proper input of the materials into the standardized Air Force
HM tracking system. This includes BE case file numbers for all authorized HM.
2.10.7.3.1. (Added) Ensure all HM containers are labeled properly, stored appropriately, and in
good condition. HM in leaking or otherwise substandard containers shall be transferred to a
new, compatible container with proper labeling or removed from the shop as hazardous waste
AFI32-7086_USAFESUP 25 AUGUST 2009                                                         3


(HW). Drips and spills from leaking containers must be cleaned up immediately to prevent
safety, health and environmental threats and damage to storage lockers and other property.
2.10.7.11.1. (Added) A complete set of MSDSs in English and, where required, the local
national language, shall also be maintained. MSDS translation assistance can be requested
through the installation Pollution Prevention Manager.
2.10.7.16. (Added) Compare MSDSs received for each shipment of HM to ensure the
formulation matches that of on-hand MSDSs and the MSDSs contained in the tracking system.
Any changes to formulation must be immediately presented to the HAZMART so any necessary
Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health reviews and reconciling database ingredient
computations can be accomplished.
2.10.12. Installation UECs will:
2.12. (Added) Unit Environmental Coordinator Program. In order to further USAFE’s
goals of achieving and maintaining environmental quality, commanders will establish a Unit
Environmental Coordinator (UEC) program. UECs will be appointed in individual units and
tenant organizations. UECs act as a point of contact for environmental issues. The UEC
program is the commander’s tool to ensure environmental quality installation-wide.
