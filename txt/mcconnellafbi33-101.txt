    2.2. Maintenance. Maintenance and support services, including repair parts for LMR equipment are
    normally obtained by contract. Support services should be furnished through the most cost-effective
    means to ensure mission support. The CSO and Base Contracting Officer (BCO) will consider guid-
    ance provided in Attachment 2 and AFI 33-106 when developing a performance work statement
    (PWS) for local contracts. The CSO will not include any equipment repair in the contract unless it is
    cost effective. Equipment requiring infrequent maintenance should be maintained on an as-required
    basis. All maintenance will be accomplished by authorized contractors.
    2.3. Frequency Assignment.
       2.3.1. Approval of LMR network does not include frequency assignments. Frequencies will be
       assigned according to AFI 10-707, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program and MAFBR
       700-4, Frequency Management. Frequencies must be assigned prior to procuring radio equip-
       ment. Organizations that require new LMR nets must submit frequency requests prior to receiving
       AF Form 2005 approval.
       2.3.2. Frequencies will be shared, if possible, using encoders to eliminate over crowding.
    2.4. Pager.
       2.4.1. A Central Base Pager Net serves all organizations on McConnell Air Force Base.
       2.4.2. Special purpose paging nets (i.e. Tactical Aircrew Alerting Net (TAAN) and the Medical
       Services Paging Net) are authorized in addition to the Central Base Pager Net.
       2.4.3. Pager authorizations are established by the base approval authority.

      3.2.1. LMR requirements fall into two categories: replacement/upgrade and new requirements.
      Contact 22 CS/SCML (LMR), ext. 3010, prior to submitting requests for LMR equipment. Failure
      to go through the LMR office could result in the incompatibility of equipment with base systems.
      The requesting unit's resource advisor will validate requests. NOTE: All LMR procurements must
      be coordinated through 22 CS/SCML (LMR).
      3.2.2. The CSO, technical advisor for the base approval authority, will ensure all requirements
      meet matters relating to standardization, technical adequacy, compatibility, and cost effectiveness
      before presenting requirements to the approval authority.
      3.2.3. The base approval authority has the authority to validate LMR requirements and approve or
      disapprove LMR technical solutions.
          3.2.3.1. Replacement or Upgrade of Equipment. Contact 22 CS/SCML for technical assis-
          tance and system compatibility prior to submitting requests for LMR equipment. An AF Form
          3215 is not required when replacing or upgrading previously validated equipment. Any
          equipment identified for replacement in the base Five-Year Replacement Plan is also exempt
          from filling out a AF Form 3215. An AF Form 2005 or IMPAC Card can be used for pur-
          chases. Each unit is responsible for funding replacement assets. Note: A one-for-one swap is
          required when upgrading equipment.
          3.2.3.2. New Requirements. An AF Form 3215 must be filled out and signed by the resource
          advisor, fund manager, or commander before submitted to the 22 CS/SCX Requirements sec-
          tion. At this point it will be assigned a CSRD tracking number and sent to the LMR section for
6                                                                        MAFBI33-101 27 March 1998

           a technical solution. See AFI 33-103, Requirements Document and Processing, for specific
           instructions on completing AF Form 3215.
           3.2.3.3. All new or special purpose LMR net requirements are researched by the base LMR
           manager before the submission to the base approval authority. The requiring unit will fund all
           new LMR units costing under $50,000.00. Items exceeding $50,000.00 are requested through
           AMC (3080 Investment Funds).
    3.3. Procurement for Base Approved CSRDs.
       3.3.1. The equipment custodian initiates the procurement cycle by submitting an AF Form 2005
       or if under $2500.00 by IMPAC Card.
       3.3.2. Base Supply verifies and processes the request. Supply must ensure base approval author-
       ity's approval prior to initiating the requisition cycle. The Stock Control Section coordinates with
       the base LMR manager to ensure that the DD Form 1348-6 reflects the correct information, then
       forwards the documents to Base Contracting.
       3.3.3. Base Supply Stock Control prepares a statement to Base Contracting. It is attached to the
       DD Form 1348-6 and will read, "All information on the DD Form 1348-6 has been verified with
       the Base LMR Manager and is correct. Refer any questions pertaining to this request to the Stock
       Control NCOIC." The LMR manager will assist contracting personnel in completing cost analysis,
       cost comparison, and technical adequacy studies to make sure the equipment meets mission
       parameters.

4. Operations.
    4.1. Operating Procedures. LMR nets will be operated in accordance with Allied Communications
    Publication (ACP) 125, Communications Instruction-Telephone Procedures. Transmissions should be
    brief, concise and accurate. Operating procedures in ACP 125 and AFKAO-1, USAF Voice Call Sign
    Instructions, will be used. Procedures in the above documents will be incorporated into the customer
    education program to ensure exposure to policy, operating techniques, operating procedures, and
    maintenance practices. The net manager assigned by the unit is responsible for net control operations.
    4.2. Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference (MIJI) Reporting: Procedures for MIJI of
    Electronic Systems Reporting, RCS: JCS-1066, will be included in customer education packages to
    make sure users are aware of possible net impairments caused by other than equipment failure (AFI
    10-707, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program).

6. Emergency Use of LMR Assets. Mobility Net. During disasters that require search and rescue
efforts, this net will be shared with 22 SVS personnel to allow for mortuary, billeting, and food service
support. The following procedures apply: 22 SVS personnel will contact Logistics Plans, 22 ARW/XP,
ext. 3290 during normal duty hours or the Chief, Logistics Plans through the command post at ext. 3251
during non-duty hours. If there are no mobility operations, Logistics Plans will hand receipt LMRs for 22
SVS use.

7. Restoration Priorities. Equipment restoral priorities are established in 22 CS Operating Instruction
33-4, Maintenance Response Priorities and Restoral Precedence.
   7.1. Multiple individual net repairs will be accomplished in the following order:
   7.2. Base stations.
   7.3. Control units (CEB, Centra-Comm, RCU).
   7.4. Other ancillary equipment affecting the entire net.
   7.5. Mobiles.
   7.6. Portables.
   7.7. Pagers.
   7.8. All other equipment.

8. Cellular Telephones.
   8.1. General: According to AFI 33-106, cellular telephones are restricted to non-operational require-
   ments. Cellular telephones will not be approved for use where classified, sensitive, or critical informa-
   tion may be inadvertently overheard and transmitted. Cellular STU-III should be used to satisfy
   operational mission requirements. Use cellular telephones as a last resort when fixed telephone ser-
   vice is unavailable and hand held radios and pagers will not meet the minimum communications
   needs. Cellular telephones are extremely vulnerable to monitoring and present a greater security risk
   than landline administration telephones.
   8.2. Acquisition. Using organization requester must submit a unit approved AF Form 3215, signed
   by the resource advisor, fund manager, or commander before submitting it to the 22 CS/SCX, require-
   ments section in Bldg. 739, Rm. 49. At this point, it will be assigned a CSRD tracking number and
   sent to the LMR section for a technical solution and evaluation. As a minimum, the AF Form 3215
   should contain the following:
       8.2.1. In the "Requirement" block:
           8.2.1.1. Identify communications capability needed.
           8.2.1.2. Who will be using the phone?
       8.2.2. In the "Justification" block:
12                                                                         MAFBI33-101 27 March 1998

            8.2.2.1. Explain why a cellular phone is required instead of alternative communications meth-
            ods such as pagers and hand held radios. How does the person requiring a cellular phone cur-
            rently stay in contact? Why is instant contact required? Why doesn't the present system work?
            How is the mission impaired without a cellular telephone?
            8.2.2.2. Provide the following security statement: "Cellular telephones are highly vulnerable
            to monitoring and will not be used for classified or sensitive information. Cellular telephone
            use constitutes consent to monitoring at all times."
     8.3. Approval. The LMR office will use the Cellular Telephone Acquisition Decision Matrix out of
     AFI 33-106 to make recommendations to the base approval authority on approval or disapproval of
     cellular telephones (See Attachment 3 for matrix). If approved, LMR will assist the customer in the
     purchase of the cellular telephone by coordinating with the contracted agency. Customer will go with
     the LMR QAE to the contractor and purchase the cellular phone and make sure all aspects of service
     are taken care of. The customer will follow the QAE back to the LMR office and the cellular phone
     will be entered into the LMR Tracking and Reporting System.
     8.4. Repair. Contact your LMR office at extension 3010 if you discover any problems with your cel-
     lular phone. LMR will coordinate with the contractor on repair. Warranty work may need to be sent to
     Kansas City, in the meantime, the LMR manager will coordinate the use of a loaner phone. Individual
     units will be responsible for purchasing new phones, chargers, and batteries that need replacing.
     8.5. Lost or Stolen Cellular Telephones. Immediately contact the LMR office at extension 3010.
     LMR will call and advise the contractor of the situation. The assigned telephone number will be
     turned off preventing incoming or outgoing calls. After duty hours, call the 22 CS/ AFNCC Help Desk
     at extension 3090. The user reports the incident to the 22d Security Police Squadron and accomplishes
     the required written report. This establishes an official record of lost or stolen government property. A
     report of survey should then be accomplished through your unit. A copy of the report of survey must
     be sent to the 22CS/SCML office in order to delete the equipment from your account. Without this
     report, you will still be responsible for the asset.
     8.6. Cellular Validations. The cellular phone bill will be validated monthly by each unit’s Telephone
     Control Officer (TCO). The TCO will be required to evaluate the bill and ensure that all numbers
     called were for official use only. The TCO will sign and return the bill to the 22CS/SCML office. The
     SCML office will do a 10% inspection of all cellular phone bills monthly to ensure the TCO is prop-
     erly validating cellular calls in accordance with directives.
     8.7. Revalidations. The LMR office will send the TCO a revalidation sheet for each cellular phone.
     The TCO certifies cellular telephones annually to ensure they are still being used as previously
     approved. Cellular telephones failing to be revalidated are subject to being shut off.
     8.8. Billing For Cellular Air Time. Cellular telephones are for "Official Use Only."
        8.8.1. The 22 CS receives monthly cellular air time billing. The 22 CS/SCML breaks down the
        monthly bill by organization and forwards them to the TCO's. Unit TCO's, in turn, send the bills to
        the responsible individuals for official call certification. The TCO verifies all charges and returns
        the bill to 22 CS/SCML.
        8.8.2. Unofficial calls in excess of one minute will be charged to the use. If an individual is iden-
        tified as using the cellular telephone for unofficial calls, the TCO will annotate the AF Form 649,
        Verification of Long Distance Calls, and accomplish a memorandum addressed to 22 CS/SCML
MAFBI33-101 27 March 1998                                                                                13

     identifying the responsible person. The AF Form 649, the memorandum, and the bill will then be
     forwarded to 22 CS/SCML for processing. The 22CS/SCML will them prepare a memorandum
     for the individual to take to the 22 CS Billing Clerk (22 CS/SCXB) for payment, with a total cost
     equal to or greater than $1.50 will be charged to the user. If an individual is identified as using the
     cellular telephone for unofficial calls, the TCO will highlight the calls that were deemed unofficial
     by the user and return the bill to the billing clerk (22CS/SCXB). The TCO can contact the Billing
     office at extension 3012.
     8.8.3. The 22 CS Billing Clerk (SCXB) will prepare a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher,
     and return it to the TCO for the user to process at the cashier’s cage in Finance. If the collection is
     not paid in a reasonable amount of time, the individual's squadron first sergeant and/or com-
     mander will be notified for appropriate administrative action.
     8.8.4. Direct any questions or concerns regarding this instruction to 22 CS/SCML at extension
     3010.

                 CELLULAR TELEPHONE ACQUISITION DECISION MATRIX

A3.1. Does the requirement document specify that the primary use is for Command & Control Commu-
nications? (If "YES" look for a technical solution other than a cellular telephone. If "NO" proceed to the
next paragraph.)

A3.2. Does the requirement document identify a need for transmission/reception of classified, or sensi-
tive unclassified information in a mobile environment? (If "YES" look at a portable/mobile STU-III tech-
nical solution rather than a conventional cellular instrument. If "NO" proceed to the next paragraph.)

A3.3. Does satisfaction of this requirement with a cellular telephone result in the net reduction in the
number of LMRs or pagers in use on the base? (If "YES" examine paragraphs A3.4. and A3.5. If "NO"
proceed to paragraph A3.6.)

A3.4. Does satisfaction of this requirement identify a mission that was previously satisfied by an LMR or
pager? (If "YES" proceed to paragraph A3.5. If "NO" proceed to paragraph A3.6.)

A3.5. What aspect of the original mission has changed, which makes the continued use of LMR or pagers
unworkable? (IF the requirement is essentially the same as before and convenience is the primary reason
for the request, acquisition of a cellular telephone is not warranted. If there is a substantial change to the
mission , proceed to paragraph A3.6.)

A3.6. Is there a serious mission degradation, failure, or life and death impact not previously present that
you cannot meet through the use of LMRs or pagers? (If "YES" consider the applicability of cellular
instruments. If "NO" look for a technical solution other than cellular telephone.)
