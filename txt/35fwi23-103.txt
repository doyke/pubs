This instruction implements AFPD 23-1, Requirements and Stockage of Materiel, and establishes proce-
dures applicable to the Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP). This instruction applies to all activ-
ities generating precious metals. This instruction consolidates and simplifies pertinent data contained in
AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4, USAF Supply Manual.


1. GENERAL:
   1.1. All activities that use precious or generate precious metals-bearing residue must appoint a pri-
   mary and alternate monitor to manage the unit’s program. All medical, dental, audiovisual/photo-
   graphic and maintenance functions are primarily affected. Special attention and emphasis must be
   placed on the recovery of scrap and residual materiel in the following categories:
       1.1.1. Photographic chemicals and film.
       1.1.2. Platinum-tipped spark plugs.
       1.1.3. Magneto points/assemblies.
       1.1.4. Communication-electronic and electronic scrap.
       1.1.5. Silver-zinc and mercury batteries.
       1.1.6. Brazing rods/materiel.
       1.1.7. Sunglass frames, distinctive buttons, medals/decorations, trophies and relics.
       1.1.8. X-ray and dental scrap.
       1.1.9. Items with expendability, recoverability, reparability category designators of “XF3” code
       “P” and “XB3” code ”N” are not throw away items.
2                                                                         35FWI23-103 16 JULY 2005


2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
    2.1. The 35 FW Commander will appoint the 35 LRS, Materiel Management Flight, Inspection Ele-
    ment (35 LRS/LGRMI) as the 35 FW PMRP Monitor.
    2.2. All activities involved in the PMRP are required to maintain a current copy of the applicable pub-
    lications 35 FWI 23-103 and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6 Chapter 4.
    2.3. The 35 FW PMRP Monitor is responsible for the following:
       2.3.1. Maintain a list of each unit’s PMRP monitor’s/alternate’s name, phone number, location,
       type of recovery equipment, precious metals generated and precious metals used.
       2.3.2. Ensure activities receiving, issuing and using fine precious metals items having a high con-
       tent of precious metals that are assigned Controlled Item Code (CIC) “R” (fine precious metals/
       high contents of precious metals) appoint an individual in writing to receipt for and issue these
       items. Additionally, the PMRP Monitor will develop and process a local computer program to
       produce a semi-annual listing identifying those National Stock Numbers (NSN) against which a
       Precious Metal Indicator Code (PMIC) requiring monitoring is assigned. Distribute a copy of the
       list to each agency identified as producing Precious Metals (PM) with a cover letter, to be indorsed
       by the receiving agency and returned to 35 LRS/LGRMI within 10 calendar days. This letter will
       be filed in an organizational PMRP jacket file.
       2.3.3. Ensure each activity having electrolytic recovery units and/or silver recovery cartridges
       appoints an individual to harvest the silver flake or sludge from the unit and/or change cartridges.
       Also ensure a disinterested party witness the harvesting and also weighs the flake or sludge and
       signs the turn-in documentation.
       2.3.4. Ensure each activity involved in the PMRP initiates and maintains a self-inspection pro-
       gram to include, as a minimum, periodic testing of hypo-solution draining from electrolytic/car-
       tridge units. This ensures they are operating properly and are compliant with receipt, issue and
       turn in requirements.
       2.3.5. Prepare a visit schedule for each participating activity at least once every 12 months to
       review operations, documentation and adherence to overall program requirements. Conduct train-
       ing on a quarterly or as-required basis. Perform, as a minimum, one no-notice inspection in each
       participating unit annually. Prepare and maintain reports of findings. Ensure corrective action is
       taken by using activities on identified discrepancies and maintain file copies for two years in a PM
       jacket file.
       2.3.6. Ensure any activity having items laboratory tested for presence of PM provides the results,
       whether positive or negative, to the Integrated Materiel Manager (IMM) that manages that NSN
       for assignment of the appropriate PMIC in the federal cataloguing system (FEDLOG).
       2.3.7. Apprise the servicing Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) concerning
       segregation of precious metal-bearing scrap or the need for scrap containers.
       2.3.8. Ensure activities receiving, issuing and handling precious metal-bearing materiel assigned
       CIC ”R” maintain auditable records, and the records and quantities of materiel on hand are audited
       by disinterested personnel (person not involved in the use or recovery of precious metals). This
       should be done periodically, but no less than twice per calendar year.

       2.3.9. 35 LRS Customer Service will issue off-line DRMO document numbers to PM monitors
       and maintain a log with NSN, document number, unit of issue, quantity, demilitarization code, and
       PM monitor’s name.
   2.4. Each agency generating PM Monitor will:
