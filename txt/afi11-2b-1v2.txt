                                                Chapter 1

                                      GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. Conduct all evaluations in accordance with (IAW) the provisions of AFI 11-202 Vol 2, the
ACC supplement to Vol 2 and this instruction.

1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM A3. Waivers will be requested from
the parent MAJCOM A3 through appropriate Stan/Eval channels

1.3. Procedures.
    1.3.1. The Flight Examiner (FE) will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it
    will be conducted prior to the sortie. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in accor-
    dance with the flight position during the evaluation. FEs will assist in mission planning/briefing as
    tasked and will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data and mission materials.
    1.3.2. Unless specified, the examinee may fly in any flight position/seat which will best enable the FE
    to conduct a thorough evaluation.
    1.3.3. If an actual emergency occurs, at a minimum the initial reaction will be evaluated. The FE will
    use discretion to determine when to suspend/terminate an evaluation. The FE may, at his or her discre-
    tion, choose to continue the evaluation. If the evaluation is continued, the evaluator will explicitly
    inform the crew of the change.
    1.3.4. FEs should use authorized recording devices (e.g. Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation
    (ACMI), Range Integration Instrumentation System (RIIS), or digital recording) to re-construct/eval-
    uate the mission. When used, these recordings will be managed as official electronic records IAW
    AFMAN 33-363 and disposed of only IAW the AF RDS. Contact supporting records professionals.
    1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the FE will review
    the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, assigned area grades (if other than qualified), and
    assign any required additional training.
    1.3.6. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. When it is impossible to evaluate a required area
    in-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e. Weapons System Trainer (WST) or verbal
    examination). FEs will document areas not evaluated in flight, the alternate methods used and justifi-
    cation in the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.

1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and
this volume.
    1.4.1. Compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation with the
    area performance standards contained in AFI 11-202V2 and provided in this volume before assigning
    an appropriate grade. Exercise judgment for subjective areas and specific situations not covered.
    1.4.2. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
    aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the examinee applies
    prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. The FE will consider cumula-
    tive deviations, compare to area grading criteria, and apply judgment when determining overall
    grades.
AFI11-2B-1V2 13 JUNE 2008                                                                             5


     1.4.3. FE judgment is the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
     1.4.4. General Criteria. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as
     noted for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria
Q         Altitude                     + 200 feet
          Airspeed/Mach                + 5%
          Navigation                   + 3NM
          Tacan Arc                    + 2NM
 Q-       Altitude                     + 300 feet
          Airspeed/Mach                + 10%
          Navigation                   + 5 Miles
          Tacan Arc                    + 3NM
 U        Exceeds Q- tolerances

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. Conduct EPEs in the Weapons System Trainer (WST). If the
WST is unavailable, the EPE may be given verbally. EPEs are commensurate with the examinee's mission
status (Combat Mission Ready [CMR] or Basic Mission Capable [BMC]). (Note: Airspeed and altitude
tolerances are increased 50% for evaluations conducted in the WST.)
     1.5.1. FEs will evaluate crewmembers of like specialty.
     1.5.2. FEs will administer EPEs in the WST as integrated crews. The OG/CC may grant waivers per-
     mitting an independent mode EPE on a case by case basis. The OG/CC may grant an independent EPE
     waiver only for recurring evaluations. Post the MFR in the FEF until AF Form 8 completion, and
     annotate in the Additional Comments section of the AF Form 8. In no case will two consecutive EPEs
     be conducted in independent mode.

1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Document weapons employment results in the
Mission Description section of the AF Form 8. The abbreviations used to document weapons scores are in
accordance with AFI 11-2B1 Vol 1, B-1 Aircrew Training or current MAJCOM RAP tasking message.
     1.6.1. Air-to-Surface. Record delivery type and weapons grades for each air-to-surface delivery.
     Weapons delivery hit criteria for MSN evaluations is IAW AFI 11-2B-1V1, B-1 Aircrew Training. On
     unmanned ranges where precise scoring is not available or for simulated deliveries, FEs will assess
     weapons employment results based on procedures. Document results using "Hit/Miss" as in Table 1.2.
     (Note: Impacts exceeding AFI 11-2B-1V1 hit criteria will be documented as a "Miss.")
6                                                                          AFI11-2B-1V2 13 JUNE 2008


Table 1.2. Weapons Employment Grades.
Weapons employment grades were:
HASD               GD             LASD             DD               SD
*Miss              *Hit           Miss             Miss             *Miss
*FE Assessed

    1.6.2. FE Judgment. FEs will apply judgment when determining the weapons employment grade.
    FEs will not consider WSO performance as less than qualified based solely on unreliable/substandard
    scores. FEs may override substandard weapons scores when weapon delivery procedures are satisfac-
    tory. Conversely, if the evaluatee uses marginal or unacceptable procedures, the FE will grade accord-
    ingly regardless of scores. The FE will include justification for such an award in the Additional
    Comments Section of the AF Form 8.

1.7. Examinations:
    1.7.1. Emergency Procedures Examination (Closed Book):
        1.7.1.1. General Knowledge. This exam consists of a minimum of 20 questions and includes
        information applicable to the individual's crew position and the unit's mission. Units may increase
        the number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of the examinee's knowledge.
        1.7.1.2. Boldface. This exam will consist of written recitation of each boldface procedure appli-
        cable to the individual's specialty. Each answer must contain all critical action items in proper
        sequence. Verbatim responses are not required; however, answers must clearly state the intended
        course of action.
    1.7.2. Qualification Examination (Open Book). This examination will be derived from all flight
    manuals and governing command directives. The exam will consist of at least 50 questions. Units may
    increase the number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of the examinee's knowledge.
        1.7.2.1. WSO exams will consist of questions applicable to both Offensive Systems Officer
        (OSO) and Defensive Systems Officer (DSO) positions.

1.8. Instructor Evaluations:
    1.8.1. An instructor on a SPOT, RQ, or periodic evaluation who receives an area grade of U or Q-
    with additional training in any area will receive a QUAL grade of “Q3”.
        1.8.1.1. An individual on an INIT INSTR evaluation receiving an area grade of U or Q- with addi-
        tional training in any area will receive an INSTR grade of “3”. QUAL, INSTM or MSN may be
        graded “1”, “2” or “3” accordingly.
    1.8.2. An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training in any grading area
    will not perform instructor duties until additional training is complete. The FE will check the “Restric-
    tions” block and annotate the restriction on the back of the AF Form 8

1.9. Records Disposition. Dispose of records IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures and
Responsibilities.
AFI11-2B-1V2 13 JUNE 2008                                                                               7


                                               Chapter 2

                                  EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. Evaluation requirements are depicted in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. All areas marked with
an “R” are required and must be accomplished.
   2.1.1. Mission Data. If using pre-planned products, the evaluatee is responsible for ensuring the data
   briefed and used in the aircraft is accurate and effective for mission accomplishment.
   2.1.2. Currency of Flight Publications. During all evaluations, FEs will evaluate all required T.O.s
   and in-flight publications for currency and accuracy IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-215, USAF
   Flight Manuals Program. Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supple-
   ment to AFI 11-202V2.

2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluations. Pilot instrument, pilot qualification, WSO qualification,
and instructor evaluations are generally flown in conjunction with MSN evaluations for efficiency. How-
ever, each evaluation type may be administered on any compatible training mission with the approval of
the Chief of Stan/Eval and the commander's concurrence.
   2.2.1. Pilot Instrument Requirements. The requirements for completion of the pilot instrument
   evaluation are delineated in Table 2.1. with specific area evaluation criteria in Chapter 3.
   2.2.2. Pilot Qualification Requirements. In addition to the requirements delineated in Table 2.1.
   and specific area evaluation criteria in Chapter 3, the following applies:
       2.2.2.1. Emergency Traffic Patterns/Approaches/Landings . FTU and FIC maneuver qualified
       instructors may either accomplish a No Flap/Slat Touch and Go in flight or a Simulated
       Two-Engine Out Approach/Go-Around in flight or in the simulator. (Note. Ref Table 2.1. Areas
       21 and 22). All other pilots are required to accomplish a No Flap/Slat Touch and Go in flight.
           2.2.2.1.1. For FTU/FIC qualified instructors, the WST may be used to complete this portion
           of the evaluation provided an emergency traffic pattern was accomplished in flight during the
           previous evaluation. The usage of the WST for a evaluation does not include emergency traffic
           patterns flown during an EPE.
   2.2.3. WSO Qualification Requirements. WSO completion requirements are delineated in Table
   2.1. and Chapter 3.

2.3. Mission Evaluation. Mission evaluation items are delineated in Table 2.1. with specific area evalu-
ation criteria in Chapter 3. FEs will evaluate examinees at their highest qualification level. Evaluations
during exercises or deployments, where permitted, are encouraged. (Note: BMC pilots and WSOs should
only be evaluated on those missions they routinely perform. Examinees will only be evaluated on those
areas for which they are current and qualified.)
   2.3.1. Evaluation Profiles. Mission evaluations will reflect Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
   tasking scenarios. Mission evaluations will demonstrate the individual's ability to accomplish combat
   taskings to include special missions. Units will attempt to schedule actual weapon releases and forma-
   tion for mission evaluations however single ship sorties may be used if necessary.
8                                                                          AFI11-2B-1V2 13 JUNE 2008


    2.3.2. Weapons Employment. Any bomb run, actual or simulated, satisfies this requirement. All
    planned/attempted releases will be evaluated. Degraded delivery procedures can meet the require-
    ments of the evaluation.
    2.3.3. Electronic Warfare Mission Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish requirements delin-
    eated in Table 2.1., column 6. Squadrons will schedule at least one defensive action electronic attack
    (EA) event. The run should be scheduled against a Multiple Threat Emissions Systems (MUTES)
    capable site, simulators, emulators, or actual EA assets. Threat scenarios should represent unit task-
    ings. If the scheduled activity is attempted and not flown to completion due to circumstances beyond
    the aircrew's control, the requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied by accomplishing any por-
    tion of an EA run if the FE observes sufficient activity.

2.4. Offensive Systems Officer (OSO)/Defensive Systems Officer (DSO) only. Individuals qualified
as OSO only will use Table 2.1. columns 4 and 5. DSO only qualified individuals will use Table 2.1. col-
umns 4 and 6

2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee's
instructor knowledge and ability. Instructors are required to demonstrate instructor ability on all evalua-
tions. For evaluations conducted in flight or the WST, the examinee will conduct a student critique fol-
lowing the crew debrief. Evaluators will provide the examinee a performance critique following the
student critique.
    2.5.1. For evaluations not accomplished in conjunction with an INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation, the
    examinee will brief, instruct, and debrief a flight or WST profile representative of the unit’s mission.
    (Note: Do not accomplish Instructor Pilot evaluations in the WST.)
    2.5.2. For scheduled instructor evaluations, the evaluator may require the examinee to present verbal
    explanations of equipment operations and procedures pertinent to crew duties and responsibilities.
    Special demonstrations or instruction requested by the evaluator should not interfere with normal mis-
    sion accomplishment. Evaluators will provide sufficient time for the instructor to prepare for critiques.
    2.5.3. Instructor Pilot Evaluations. All initial and recurring instructor pilot evaluations may be
    administered in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations. Except for the requirements
    delineated in Table 2.1., specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the FE.
    2.5.4. Instructor WSO Evaluations. All initial and recurring instructor WSO evaluations may be
    administered in conjunction with QUAL/MSN evaluations. The initial Instructor WSO evaluation
    may be conducted in flight or in the WST. The instructor examinee must demonstrate instructor abili-
    ties in both the OSO and DSO positions. As a minimum, the scheduled profile will include bombing
    and EA. If qualified as an OSO or DSO only, the examinee will perform duties for the respective posi-
    tion being evaluated.

                                       EVALUATION CRITERIA

3.1. General Grading Standards:
     3.1.1. The grading criteria in this chapter are divided into three sections: General, Instrument, and
     Tactical Employment. Use all sections for criteria applicable to the events performed on the evalua-
     tion.
     3.1.2. Where major areas are divided into subareas, only one grade will be assigned to the major
     areas. Annotate discrepancies on the back of the AF Form 8 by sub area.
     3.1.3. Areas marked (P) are for pilots only; areas marked (AC) are for pilots qualified as aircraft com-
     manders only; areas marked (W) are for WSOs only. All other areas are common to all aircrews.

3.2. General:
     3.2.1. Area 1--Mission Planning:
        3.2.1.1. Mission Planning:
            3.2.1.1.1. Q. Developed a sound plan to accomplish the mission. Accurately and efficiently
            accomplished mission preparation. Established objectives for the mission. Checked all factors
            applicable to flight in accordance with applicable directives. Aware of alternatives available, if
            flight cannot be completed as planned.
            3.2.1.1.2. Q-. Same as above, except minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors which did not
            detract from mission effectiveness. Knowledge of performance capabilities or approved oper-
            ating procedures/rules was marginal in some areas.
            3.2.1.1.3. U. Major deviations, omissions, and/or errors would preclude safe/effective mis-
            sion accomplishment. Displayed faulty knowledge of operating data or procedures. Did not
            review or initial Go/No-Go items.
        3.2.1.2. Publications:
            3.2.1.2.1. Q. Assigned flight manual publications were current and usable for any of the unit's
            combat taskings. Contained only minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors.

            of the targets were acquired on the first attack or with a successful reattack.
NOTE: A successful reattack is defined as being within parameters to effectively employ the planned
weapons against the target.
        3.4.3.2. Area 82 – Weapons Employment: Evaluate each planned/attempted release.
            3.4.3.2.1. Q. Correctly utilized the weapon system to deliver the desired ordnance (actual or
            simulated) and correctly analyzed malfunctions. Executed all required procedures to success-
            fully employ the weapon. Crosshair placement/weapon score was within AFI 11-2B-1V1,
            established reliability criteria. Achieved all weapons release parameters. At least 50% of all
            bombs in each event were within hit criteria.
            3.4.3.2.2. Q-. Minor errors in knowledge of weapons delivery procedures, attack parameters,
            weapons computations, or error analysis for the events performed. Minor procedural errors
            degraded weapons employment. At least 50% of all bombs in each event were within hit crite-
            ria.
            3.4.3.2.3. U. Demonstrated inadequate knowledge of weapons delivery procedures, attack
            parameters, weapons computations or error analysis for the events flown. Did not correctly
            prepare the weapon system to deliver the desired ordnance. Improper procedures during the
            attack resulted in unsuccessful weapons delivery. Less than 50% of all bombs in each event
            were within hit criteria. The overall grade for weapons employment will be unqualified when
            any of the following occur:
