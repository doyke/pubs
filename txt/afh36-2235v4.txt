                                Section A
                Technology's Role in Education and Training

Technology          Technology is an integrated and accepted part of American
integration         society. The popular saying that "the world is shrinking"
                    summarizes the impact of technology in making more information
                    readily accessible and easier to transmit. One of the most
                    important skills taught to students of all ages is the ability to use
                    technology to access, analyze, filter, and organize the
                    overwhelming flow of information.


Education's         The Air Force education and training communities, as part of the
acceptance of       world's most technological air force, have made halting progress
technology          in integrating and adapting available communications
                    technologies into the instructional programs. The restraints that
                    limit full technology infusion into education and training are similar
                    in the military and in civilian educational institutions:

                        "Mistrust of the unknown" that many experienced and
                        respected educators, trainers, and managers have for
                        technology.
                        Difficulty of comprehending the constantly changing, detail-
                        demanding, and often oversold capabilities of the
                        technologies offered as "tools."
                        Frequently shared opinions that use of technology in the
                        educational setting is a surrender to the entertainment media.
                         "Why should video be used in the classroom—shouldn't the
                        teacher be teaching instead?" This narrow view ultimately
                        denies teachers the use of valuable instructional tools.
                        Lack of sufficient training for teachers, instructors, course
                        designers, and managers in the understanding and
                        implementation of technology tools.
                        Insufficient studies that can effectively demonstrate the
                        learning enhancements and cost efficiencies of technology-
                        supported courses.
                        High front-end costs associated with computers and other
                        communication systems.

Potential benefits      Researchers continue to investigate the effectiveness and
from technology         efficiency of a broad range of computer-based instruction,
for education and       generally involving multimedia and telecommunications (see
training                Chapter 2 for discussion of these technologies). The complexity
                        of multimedia—delivering information in many media at once—
                        complicates the research process. The following initial
                        observations are supported by current literature in the field.

                        Multi-sensory delivery    Research in learning styles shows that
                                                  some students learn best from audio,
                                                  some from visual, some from touch.
                                                  Multimedia instruction tends to assist
                                                  more students.
                        Self-expression and       Technologies provide stimulating
                        active learning           environments for students to be active
                                                  in the learning process. Active
                                                  involvement on the part of students
                                                  results in many positive effects.
                        Cooperative learning      Technology provides more opportunities
                                                  for students to work cooperatively.
                                                  Some multimedia programs can serve
                                                  as manager, organizational base,
                                                  advisor, and evaluator of the group

Technologies for       The technologies of most immediate benefit to education and
education and          training are communications and computer technologies. Those
training               technologies merge in the form of what is generally referred to as
                       multimedia.


Definition of          In its narrowest sense, "multimedia" means the integration of two
multimedia             or more media with a personal computer. The media list includes
                       audio, video, text, graphics, and animation. The latest
                       technologies even add odors. The dynamic growth of many
                       technologies, including the integration technologies that bring the
                       diverse systems under the precise control of a personal
                       computer, offer extremely powerful tools in many fields,
                       especially education and training.


Why focus on           Multimedia should be viewed conceptually as a convergence of
multimedia?            communications technologies into a coordinated system
                       controlled by the user. The following applications appear to

                 acceptance of the technologies as tools useful to the profession.
                 The appropriate infusion of technology is an unending, inevitable
                 process.

                       Useful Basics About Technologies

Hardware and          A basic categorization of the many elements of a computer
software              system is a distinction between hardware and software.

                         Hardware includes everything tangible—that physically exists.
                         This includes the processor unit, disk drives, cabling, boards
                         or cards that are mounted internal to the processor, and
                         peripheral devices such as printers, keyboards, compact disc
                         players, and modems.
                         Software includes everything else—the conceptual and
                         intellectual properties such as data, programs, and operating
                         systems. Some software permanently resides in the computer
                         system to control low-level functions and operations; this is
                         called firmware or read-only memory.


Analog and            There are two basic media in which electronics function:
digital
electronic media         Analog signals are continuous and smooth fluctuations, like
                         waves of water. Most things in nature are analog form,
                         including light and sound and electromagnetism. Because
                         electric current also flows in analog form, early electronics
                         were developed in analog.
                         Digital signals are represented by numbers. Each value is a
                         discrete step, rather than a smooth variation as in analog.
                         Most modern electronics are developed as digital systems,
                         allowing exacting data and control over processes. The
                         greater manipulation of digital data also assists in the
                         reduction in size of represented data.

                      Most multimedia equipment today has both analog and digital
                      components. The ability of the two systems to convert back and
                      forth is one of the major achievements in electronics in recent
                      years.

(Continued)          for audio and videotapes and for floppy disk and hard disk
                     storage media used with computers.

                     The trend in storage media is toward optical media, which owe
                     their existence to the laser. Optical media are created by
                     focusing a laser beam on a very precise area of a plastic disk and
                     turning the laser on and off several million times a second,
                     thereby creating a representation of bits of data. This stored data
                     is read by another laser beam for playback. (Later chapters
                     compare the media advantages and disadvantages.) The
                     following table lists examples of magnetic and optical media.

Computers            Computers have evolved from vacuum tubes to transistors to
                     integrated circuit technologies. The term "computer" has been
                     popularized to include the hardware and software programs. It is
                     helpful for managers to remember that computer hardware
                     systems still consist of four primary elements: an input device,
                     memory system, central processing unit, and an output device.

Computer           There are several loosely defined categories of computers,
categories         ranging from mainframes through minicomputers and
                   workstations to personal computers, or "PCs." The categories
                   are based on performance and volume capabilities, and those are
                   changing daily. At the time of this writing, high-end mainframes
                   can perform 2,000 million instructions per second (MIPS);
                   personal computers can perform 1 to 3 MIPS.


Computer           The movement today in industry and business applications is
hardware           away from mainframe, centralized computer centers to
trends             decentralized operations. The growth in power and performance
                   and networking capabilities of PCs makes them satisfactory for
                   most computer applications. This applies to most education and
                   training applications.


Stand-alone        Almost any PC can serve as a stand-alone learning station. A
systems            stand-alone system is a self-contained unit. Each unit is totally
                   independent from others.


Advantages         Advantages of stand-alone systems are:

                      They are the least expensive systems to purchase.
                      Since there is no network, a breakdown of one PC will not
                      affect all the students or PCs.
                      Their response time is faster than network systems.


Disadvantages      Disadvantages of stand-alone systems are:

                      There is no centralized location for gathering, receiving, and
                      updating data.
                      You must distribute revised instructional materials to each
                      student.
                      Gathering test results and other management functions can be
                      cumbersome and time-consuming.
                      There is no ability to share resources (e.g., printer).
                      There is no communication links between students,
                      developers, and instructors.

                   Differences in individual computers or software installed can
                   absorb a considerable amount of the instructor’s time.

Boards, cards,       Existing computer hardware systems are made more useful for
and peripherals      specific functions by the addition of boards, a collection of
                     integrated circuits and other electronics mounted on a thin
                     material sheet. A card is the same as a board. Boards are
                     essentially peripheral devices, except that they are mounted into
                     slots in the processor box. The boards can be used to add input
                     or output features to the system. For example, a board may have
                     to be added to convert the computer's digital output into analog
                     signals for display on a color monitor. Peripheral devices are
                     normally devices, which are external to the computer and cabled
                     to the unit.


Standards for        Newly developing standards for multimedia computers are
Multimedia           important for managers to know because education and training
Computers            applications are now or soon will be multimedia programs.
                     Developed by Microsoft and adopted by an industry group known
                     as the Multimedia PC Marketing Council, the Multimedia Personal
                     Computer (MPC) standard is a set of guidelines, which dictate
                     minimum configuration of a computer system that will be used for
                     multimedia applications. The second generation of the MPC
                     standard was announced in mid-1993 for advanced multimedia
                     programs.

Understanding        The specifications and recommendations in the MPC standards
MPC standards        will have more meaning for managers after reading this volume.
                     The standards will become a reference list for managers
                     checking on computers recommended for new applications in
                     their areas of responsibility.


Storage and          Computers have two types of memory: random-access memory
memory               (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM).

                       RAM. Random-access memory is where the data and
                       programs reside while being worked on. Each location on the
                       RAM device is accessible, and the ability to read the data at
                       any location is part of the computer's power to "think."
                       Essentially, each location contains one type of data. RAM is
                       active only when the computer is turned on.
                       ROM. Read-only memory allows the computer to read data
                       from it but not write new data to it. ROM is most often used for
                       storing the operating instruction for programs (instructions
                       which should not need changing) and for programs intended for
                       playback, such as audio and video files.


Memory capacity      Massive amounts of memory are needed for multimedia, because
                     the data files are large for quality sound, graphics, and video.
                     The more memory, the better.

Hard disks and      All disk drives use a platter that spins like a record on a turntable.
floppy disks        The platter has concentric rings, called tracks. The rapidly
                    spinning disk is read by an electromagnetic head that moves in
                    and out on a radius from the center. Thus, any area on the disk
                    is equally accessible. These disks are in two forms:

                       Hard disks are disks coated with ferrous particles that can be
                       controlled as magnetic fields. In PCs, hard disks are
                       designed to remain installed in the computer's hard disk drive
                       unit.
                       Floppy disks are magnetic disks about the thickness of
                       photographic film. They are encased in a protective jacket
                       with an opening through which the head can read the data on
                       the spinning disk. The first floppies were 5.25 inches square.
                       They are now being replaced by 3.5-inch square disks
                       encased in a plastic jacket, and are no longer "floppy." The
                       smaller disks hold more data and are more durable.
                       Computers must have separate disk drives for each disk
                       format. Floppy disks are easy to transport and store outside
                       the computer.
                       Portable storage disks (Jaz & Zip). With increased storage
                       required by multimedia 3.5 in disks have given way to much
                       larger portable storage disks such as Zip drives and disks or
                       Jaz drives and disks that can store up to 2 gigabytes of
                       information.
                       CD-ROM. By far one of the most used devices for storage of
                       data is the CD ROM disk. CD ROM has been used widely for
                       multimedia but even these are being replaced by newer
                       technologies.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 4        1 November 2002                                      25




Optical discs:      These discs are mass storage media. They differ from
compact discs and   electromagnetic disks in that optical discs use laser technology to
video discs         write data in very minute spaces on a plastic disk, essentially
                    etching the disk so that another laser can shine a light into the
                    data area and read the reflection as data.

                    Note that optical media discs are spelled with a "c" and
                    electromagnetic media disks are spelled with a "k." Optical
                    media discs come in two varieties:

                       Compact discs are 4.72-inch-diameter plastic disks used in
                       music playback systems and with computers as a mass
                       storage device of audio and visual data for multimedia. (See
                       additional detail in Chapter 3.)
                       Videodiscs are 12-inch-diameter plastic discs and are used to
                       store the large amount of data needed for motion video and
                       sound. (See additional detail in Chapter 4.) Note however,
                       the current emphasis is moving toward DVD for data storage.


Storage             Data not currently being worked on by a computer is stored on a
                    hard disk in the machine, or on a compact disc or videodisc either
                    in the machine or external to it. Stored information cannot be
                    accessed as quickly by the computer as can data in the RAM.
                    This access and play rate limitation can degrade the capability of
                    some multimedia programs, such as the frames-per-second
                    playback rate.

Rising                A major result of the public's instant access to endless
expectations          information and the computing power to edit it into specialized,
                      high-energy communications is that the public now expects high-
                      quality, instantaneous, tailored, multimedia delivery of most
                      information. Unfortunately, this has the effect of discouraging
                      many beginning users of the communications technologies,
                      including many people in the education and training arenas.


Power to              The power to communicate in today's society is broadening
communicate           beyond the individuals who control the mass media. Much of that
                      power is being actively sought and exercised by individuals and
                      groups skilled in dynamic communications and computer
                      technologies. The more educators and trainers who master
                      these skills, the better tomorrow's instruction will be.


Need for              Managers are reminded of the importance of having an expert
technology            available to research, design and advise on matters of
experts               technology. Educators and trainers are not expected to be
                      adequately versed in the intricacies of computer technology, any
                      more than a computer scientist can be expected to research,
                      design, develop and deliver instruction. The prevention of costly
                      errors in selection and application of computer systems will more
                      than pay for the time of an expert.


Technology            Educators and trainers must also remember that, for all the
not education or      enhancements possible through the infusion of appropriate
training              technologies into instruction, technology remains only a tool.
                      Technology is not education. Technology is not training.
                      However, the educator or trainer who fails to employ the best
                      tools will soon fade into mediocrity in his or her field.

Trends to        Current trends in communications, education and training
Follow           technologies can be discerned and should be followed. Insight in
                 these areas helps decision-makers position their operations for
                 future capabilities. Some of the upcoming trends are:

                    Computers and television technologies will combine, blurring
                    any meaningful distinction. The information world is moving
                    toward electronic digital information processing. The
                    computer will become the future tool for integration and editing
                    of all forms of audio and visual information. Digital products
                    continue to improve and are becoming better than the best of
                    the analog products.
                    Teleconferencing, networking, even virtual environment
                    technologies will merge into the multi-faceted communications
                    giant. Witness the current rush by these industries to team
                    with partners in related companies.
                    Sophisticated communications technology will concentrate on
                    not only providing just-in-time, embedded training or refresher
                    tutorials to workers beginning difficult tasks, but also on
                    anytime, anywhere instruction with shareable, reusable
                    courseware objects. The student of the future will be able to
                    select his/her instruction from a menu and be much better able
                    to tailor it to his/her own individual needs.
                    All desktop and portable computers, in business and home,
                    will become increasingly multimedia-capable. Web based
                    learning is becoming a reality but is currently limited by
                    bandwidths. Highly interactive courseware requires
                    considerable bandwidth capability, which is not currently
                    available today but is the goal of the future.
                    Emphasis will continue toward automating development and
                    production processes, making it easier for new users to use
                    more of the power in the technologies.

                                       Chapter 3
                               Technology-Based Training

What is                Technology-based training is just what it sounds like. It is the use
technology-based       of technology in training. Today, while technology evolves
training (TBT)?        rapidly, sophistication increases exponentially. The training field
                       is a busy area, often depending on the same “tried and true”
                       techniques that have worked for years. Still, such techniques can
                       pose problems. Sometimes they don’t solve today’s problem as
                       well as they did yesterday’s. Often nowadays, training must deal
                       with a new environment of different systems and tools that are
                       used with ever increasing frequency to boost productivity.


How can I use it?      The environment may be right for using technology-based
                       training in your situation, yet it may not. You have to determine
                       that it is right before employing TBT. Careful needs assessment
                       determines whether high-tech methods can accomplish training
                       objectives better than conventional methods. TBT is especially
                       effective in showing motion, small detail, and providing realistic
                       experiences in learning skills. On the other hand, if you must
                       update your course materials frequently or rapidly, TBT may not
                       be the best solution.

                       Today's training environment is becoming more technology
                       based. You have to determine if it is right before employing TBT.
                       TBT is especially effective in showing motion, small detail, and
                       providing realistic experiences in learning skills.

                       In many cases, it is becoming easier to update a web site than it
                       is to print and distribute revised materials. It is also becoming
                       easier to update a web site than to distribute CD-ROM disks.
                       This has all come about during the past 5 years.

                       However, the important point is that when technology can help, it
                       usually can help in a big way. Moreover, the toughest problems
                       are the ones it solves best.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 4       1 November 2002                                         29




Implementation      Implementation is an important aspect of technology-based
                    training (TBT). Careful consideration should be given to this
                    method of training.

                    TBT resources cannot be just purchased, installed and expected
                    to work. Before implementing the technology-based training, it is
                    necessary to consider the following questions:
                       Where is TBT going to be available?
                       How are you going to sell TBT to line management?
                       How are you going to sell TBT to individual learners?
                       How are people going to know that TBT is available?
                       How is TBT going to be administered?
                       How is TBT going to be supported?


Availability        Careful consideration must be given to the location of a learning
                    workstation. It should be in a quiet part of a building where
                    learners will have privacy and not be distracted by noise. Today,
                    workstations are becoming more and more portable. Laptops
                    can be interfaced via satellite the internet at almost any location.

                    When installing more than one workstation at a location, each
                    workstation should be screened off for privacy. If audio is to be
                    used, the workstations must be located so they will not distract
                    learners or individuals working nearby.

                    Finally, the workstation must be accessible. Its location should
                    not present any barriers to its use. If it involves travel to another
                    location, this will cut down on study time and discourage the
                    learner.


Selling TBT to      Management needs to be convinced of the following facts that:
management            Technology based training (TBT) works
                      It is cost-effective
                      It is an organizational benefit

                    If management is not convinced that TBT works, they will not
                    encourage their staff to use it.


Selling TBT to      Individual staff must be able to see that using the technology will
individuals         be beneficial to them and also that the training itself is relevant. If
                    the training is irrelevant or out of date, then it will not be used.

Publicizing            All new training should have a well-publicized launch. Top
technology based       management should support the training implementation and
training               communicate the information down through the organizations.
                       Through pre-launch publicity, management may start to arouse
                       curiosity and build expectations before training is actually
                       available. You should make sure no false expectations are
                       created and avoid the oversell of the new training.

                       People must be made aware that technology-based training exist
                       in their organization. They should know what courses are
                       available and when new courses will be available.


Administration of      It is important that an “in-house” technology-based training
technology based       person has responsibility for the following:
training
                          Secure equipment
                          Produce supporting material
                          Ensure that the learner is comfortable using the technology,
                          and
                          Deal with any problem the learner may have with the
                          equipment.


Supporting             An essential element to be considered is how will the training be
technology based       supported? It is all right to have remote learning, but the learner
training               must never feel remote or alone. There are considerable benefits
                       to be gained from studying in private and at your own pace.
                       However, if you are feel alone, this can detract you from learning.

                       Learners should feel they have the support and encouragement
                       they need. They should have someone to support him or her in
                       their learning, someone to discuss problems or ask questions,
                       and someone who has an interest in whether they learn. The
                       support does not need to be local, but it is an advantage.

Domains of            Different instructional approaches are appropriate for each of the
learning              domains. It is part of the instructional development process to
                      categorize each instructional activity into one of these domains.

                      Instructional activities can be placed into one of three domains:

                         Cognitive
                         Psychomotor
                         Affective


Cognitive domain      The cognitive domain is the area of human learning. It is
                      associated with intellectual skills (e.g., assimilation of information
                      or knowledge). According to researcher Benjamin Bloom,
                      “learning in the cognitive area involves changes in knowledge,
                      comprehension, application analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.”
                      Cognitive learning objectives specify the acquisition of particular
                      knowledge or information. Technology-based learning (TBL) is
                      well suited to cognitive domain learning needs.

                      When matching cognitive objectives, TBL can control interactive
                      self-paced instruction to teach concepts, rules, principles, steps,
                      processes, and complex calculations. Combined with other
                      media, computers can teach recognition or discrimination of
                      applicable visual and audio stimuli.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 4       1 November 2002                                           32




Psychomotor           The psychomotor domain is the area of human learning. It is
domain                associated with physical movement and skills. According to
                      Bloom, “the psychomotor domain involves the demonstration of
                      some physical skill or the performance of some task.” An
                      example of psychomotor domain is playing tennis.

                      Psychomotor objectives specify muscular coordination and
                      movement, manipulation of materials and objects, or acts that
                      require neuromuscular coordination. TBL can supplement, but
                      can never fully satisfy, psychomotor domain learning needs. You
                      can best use TBL to acquaint the learner with the cognitive
                      aspects of activities that have a psychomotor component. You
                      should then follow-up with true/real activities and testing.

                      TBL station is a real world device for teaching skills when
                      learners work with (computer) terminals on the job in response to
                      psychomotor objectives. When combined with simulated
                      equipment or facilities from the job environment, computers are
                      excellent tools to create real world conditions.


Affective domain      This is the area of human learning associated with attitudes,
                      feelings, interests, opinions, worldviews, and values. In the
                      affective domain, outcomes are based on the development of
                      attitudes or feelings rather than of knowledge. This domain deals
                      with the attitudes and motivation of the learner. Affective learning
                      objectives, sometimes called attitudinal objectives, specify the
                      acquisition of particular attitudes, values, or feelings.

                      The video and multimedia TBL are powerful tool in achieving
                      affective objectives. Also, they provide interactive activities and
                      measure change.

                    Applications of optical media technology.
                    Mass storage devices for data:
                       One storage format is widely used in music playback
                       systems.
                       Another format is used in or with computers as storage for
                       data and multimedia such as sound and visual playback.

                    Small (4.72-inch diameter) plastic discs.
                    Durable, easily transportable, inexpensive to mass-produce.

                    Read-only and currently cannot be modified or updated by the
                    user.


History          Technologies maturing in the 1970s led to audio CDs that gained
                 consumer popularity in the 1980s. They were used only for audio
                 playback; for example, for music and book texts read for the
                 visually impaired or for commuters driving in their autos.

                 Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) technology is a
                 natural technological extension of the audio CD. CD-ROM
                 technology is impacting the computing world, including
                 applications for education and training. Erasable/rewritable CDs
                 are now available, meaning the information on the disk is NOT
                 permanent and can be modified or erased.


CD and           Note that the terms designate different systems. Although both
CD-ROM           systems use a compact disc storage device, most users use "CD"
Terminology      or "Compact Disc" to denote the system popularized to play back
                 music or spoken text. The term "CD-ROM" is used to denote the
                 computer package (computer, software, drive, and disc) which
                 uses the compact disc storage device. CD-ROM has also come
                 to mean the hardware and software package required in a
                 computer system to use the CD-ROM software program.

                                   Section A
                    Applications to Education and Training

Introduction         A CD-ROM disc can store information in a variety of formats,
                     many of which offer valuable educational and training assistance.
                     The combination of large storage capacity plus search capability
                     makes CD-ROM applications useful in many applications,
                     including:

                        Reference sources
                        Databases
                        Multimedia products
                        Computer software
                        All multimedia including high resolution video


Reference sources    One of the most useful applications is for reference sources. The
                     large storage capacity allows storing text, charts, graphics,
                     pictures, video and sound on a single disc.

                     Entire encyclopedia contents can be stored on a single disc. The
                     power of an electronic encyclopedia lies not only in the rapid
                     access to a particular article, such as aircraft, but in the ability to
                     use aircraft as a keyword, thereby finding every occurrence of
                     that word in the encyclopedia.

                     Examples

                     Air Force educators, trainers, courseware developers, and
                     researchers can use the power of CD-ROM references to access
                     reference materials, to electronically make available to every
                     student every Air Force manual, handbook, policy statement, and
                     technical order. The following commercial examples may also be
                     of value:

                        Information Finder by World Book provides sound and
                        graphics; offering competitive pricing, powerful search
                        techniques, and a fast and efficient interface. Furthermore, the
                        World Book Dictionary, with over 140,000 definitions, is
                        available from within the encyclopedia.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Reference sources      Microsoft BookShelf by Microsoft loads into the memory of the
(Continued)            computer and stays in the background while another computer
                       program, such as a word processor, is running. Microsoft
                       BookShelf reference materials can be called up at any time
                       (without closing the word processor). They include the
                       American Heritage Dictionary, the World Almanac, U.S. Zip
                       Code Directory, Roget's Thesaurus, Bartlett's Familiar
                       Quotations, and The Chicago Manual of Style.
                       Several encyclopedias are available; all of which provide a
                       fast, efficient alternative to manually searching an
                       encyclopedia. Grolier's Multimedia Encyclopedia is now
                       available for both Macintosh and IBM-compatible computers
                       and includes sound, pictures, and powerful search techniques.
                       The Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia offers, instead of the
                       customary text entry screens, a hypermedia interface through
                       which users click on an icon to access an area of interest.
                       Compton's also offers several alternative access routes to
                       information. For instance, in addition to typing in a search
                       word, users can navigate through a picture catalog,
                       investigate an area in an atlas, or choose a period of history
                       on the timeline. Whichever route is taken, links are available
                       to obtain the text of each article.
                       The Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary by Highlighted
                       Data will pronounce words and do much more. Webster's
                       contains all the features of its print edition (over 200,000
                       definitions) plus entry words pronounced by a human voice,
                       an option to change the display size to large type for easy
                       reading, and the ability to jump from one place to another to
                       check cross-referenced words.


Databases           One of the most important applications for CD-ROM technology is
                    the storage of large databases. Prior to CD-ROM, databases
                    were usually stored in huge indexes in libraries or mainframe
                    computers. Computers and modems could be used to access
                    the mainframe computers, but the expense was high and many
                    facilities and schools did not have the necessary equipment or
                    telephone lines.

                                                                 Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235   Volume 4       1 November 2002                                          37




Databases        Most indexes now available on CD-ROM do not contain the full
(Continued)      text of the articles. Instead, they provide the author, title, journal,
                 year of publication, and an abstract. The user can read the
                 abstract or save the information to a diskette.

                 Note that CD databases are giving way to on-line databases that
                 can be updated more easily, avoid duplication of discs, and
                 facilitate distribution. The CD database will be completely
                 obsolete in a few years.

                 Examples

                 Air Force users of CD-ROM databases include not only education
                 and training developers, but also the students themselves.
                 Making available and convenient masses of technical information
                 serves everyone from technicians on the flightline to planners and
                 acquisition staffs at the headquarters. Some current applications
                 available from sources external to the Air Force include the
                 following:

                    The Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) is a
                    national bibliographic database for educational literature.
                    ERIC references over 775 professional journals and 300,000
                    documents from other sources, such as conference papers
                    and research studies. Several companies supply search
                    software for ERIC and distribute the database on CD-ROM.

                    Periodical Abstracts, by University Microfilms International,
                    provides citations and abstracts to articles in over 300 general
                    and reference periodicals in the areas of arts, business,
                    science and computers, health, news, lifestyles, commentary,
                    education, literary and political reviews, consumers, and
                    social issues.

                    Social Issues Resources Series (SIRS) is a service that
                    provides timely information from newspapers, magazines,
                    government publications, and journals. SIRS has obtained
                    permission for reprints, so full text can be downloaded to disk
                    or printed. Abstracts are provided for any articles that are not
                    available for replication.

Multimedia       CD-ROMs can store as digital data the information presented as
products         text, graphics, sound, video, and animation. With these
                 capabilities, CD-ROM has become a major medium for
                 multimedia products. Integrated with a computer system, CD-
                 ROM's storage capacity enables interactivity in training programs
                 in a wide variety of subjects.

                 Examples

                 The Air Force has added the power of CD-ROM to some of its
                 performance improvement programs that bridge to include the
                 function of on-line training. One project for the San Antonio Air
                 Logistics Center uses two CD-ROMs linked to the computer to
                 provide Federal Stock Numbers and military parts numbers for
                 the thousands of electronic cables and connectors used in aircraft
                 systems. The identification and training system is computer-
                 based and on the computer's hard disk. The computer system
                 accesses the CD-ROMs to find and import appropriate data.

                 Many commercial companies "publish" CD-ROM products for
                 consumer, education and training applications. In addition to
                 adding sound and visuals to previously print-only information
                 sources (for example, encyclopedias), the multimedia products
                 are credited with getting and sustaining students' interest for
                 learning.

Computer         CD-ROMs store computer information and are an ideal medium
Software         for distributing computer programs. One CD-ROM can replace
                 approximately 750 computer diskettes. Distribution via CD-ROM
                 is advantageous because it is read-only; no one can erase a CD-
                 ROM by mistake. These examples are for information purposes
                 only and are not endorsed by the USAF.

                 Examples

                 The Personal Computer Special Interest Group Library contains
                 hundreds of IBM shareware computer programs. The software
                 with the CD-ROM allows you to search for computer programs
                 related to a particular topic or age level. After a program is
                 selected, it can be previewed on the CD-ROM. If you find a
                 program you want to use, you are allowed to copy it from the CD-
                 ROM to a computer diskette. Most programs request that a small
                 contribution be sent to the developer if the program is used.

                 PD ROM is produced by the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group
                 (BMUG). It contains more than 600 megabytes of publicly
                 distributable software, with over 7,000 individual files such as
                 HyperCard stacks, graphics, and games.

CD-ROM              The capacity of one CD-ROM disc exceeds 650 megabytes,
capacity            which is equivalent to several hundred diskettes or the entire text
                    of a 20-volume encyclopedia or two and a half years of issues of
                    the USA Today newspaper. In the Air Force, the entire contents
                    of the technical orders for a major weapon system can be stored
                    on a disc or two.

Hardware            In its simplest form, a CD-ROM delivery system consists of these
considerations      elements:

                    CD-ROM System
                       Element                                Function
                    CD-ROM drive         Reads the digital data stored on the disc.
                                         Drives may be built-in or external.
                    Controller           Controls the drive and interfaces with the
                                         computer. Many newer CD-ROM drives
                                         have built-in controllers.
                    Search engine        Consists of a microprocessor, memory, and
                                         software. Interprets user requests and
                                         responses and generates instructions for the
                                         controller.

                                                                    Continued on next page

(Continued)
                     Input device        Takes the user's request and responses.
                                         Typical devices are keyboards, touch screen,
                                         mice, joysticks.
                     Output device       Displays to the user the information taken
                                         from the disc. Typical devices are computer
                                         monitors, CRT displays, television sets and
                                         audio outputs, LCDs (liquid crystal displays
                                         used on portable computers), printers, data-
                                         encryption devices, and image compression
                                         and decompression devices.


Operating a          Almost all computers now have CD players incorporated into the
CD-ROM               system. Very few are external now. The computer can read the
                     data on the CD-ROM disc as if it were a hard drive. In other
                     words, you can do a directory listing or even copy files from the
                     CD-ROM disc to a diskette or hard drive. To provide efficient
                     access to the information on the disc, most CD-ROM applications
                     provide software programs to search and retrieve the desired
                     information.


Playing CD-ROMs      CD-ROM players can be internal in the computer or external
                     drives connected to the computer.

                     CD-ROM applications must be compatible with the monitor on the
                     computer system.

                        If the CD-ROM program includes color graphics, a VGA (video
                        graphics array) monitor is usually required.
                        If the CD-ROM program is text-only (few are), a monochrome
                        or CGA (color graphics adapter) monitor will work.

                     If the CD-ROM player is external to the computer, these
                     considerations apply:

                                                                  Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 4       1 November 2002                                     42




Playing CD-ROMs         An additional card (board) must be installed in the computer.
(Continued)             The interface cable connects the player and the internal card.
                        A software program, usually Microsoft Extensions, must be
                        added on the computer's start-up drive. This allows the
                        computer to communicate with the CD-ROM player as if it
                        were an additional hard drive.


Playing CD-ROM       A CD-ROM player can be used with any Macintosh computer.
on Macintosh         These particulars apply:

                        Access files on the CD-ROM disc must be loaded into the
                        Macintosh start-up system software. The files provide the
                        software protocol necessary for the computer to read the data
                        on the CD-ROM.
                        For audio output, CD-ROM players usually include a
                        headphone jack and output connections for external speakers


A CD-ROM             Audio can be captured in, stored, and replayed from a digital
audio note           format. CD-ROM's ability to combine audio and visual outputs in
                     the same program is a major strength of the system.

                     CD-ROM systems can play audio from both the CD-ROM
                     formatted disc and the CD-digital audio disc (the popular music
                     disc). However, CD-ROM discs cannot be played in a CD-audio
                     player.

                     Almost all computers now have this capability built-in.


Jukeboxes            A jukebox is a CD-ROM player that will hold more than one disc,
                     usually four to six. The needed disc is accessed through the
                     software control of the computer.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 4       1 November 2002                                       43




CD-ROM networks       Several computers can share a CD-ROM drive if the appropriate
                      hardware and software are connected to a network. With a CD-
                      ROM drive on a network, the applications can be accessed
                      throughout a building or group of buildings. However, CD-ROMs
                      on a network can be quite slow if the demand is high but new
                      technology is rapidly improving access speeds. Copyright issues
                      must also be considered. Be sure to obtain a network-ready,
                      multiple-user license for each application.

                      Another issue to consider with networked CD-ROM is multimedia
                      support. In many cases, audio will play only at the server station,
                      and not on the individual workstations. In addition, video and
                      animation files can be slow and "jerky" over the network.

                      There are three basic approaches for implementing a CD-ROM
                      network:

                         Peer-to-peer
                         Combination File Server/CD-ROM Server
                         Dedicated CD-ROM Server


Peer-to-peer          In a peer-to-peer network, there is no file server. Instead, a small
                      group of computers is connected to each other, which allows
                      them to share their resources. Peer-to-peer networking is
                      inexpensive and easy to install. Simply put a network card in
                      each individual machine, connect them with cables, and install
                      the peer-to-peer software

                      Peer-to-peer networks are most appropriate when the
                      simultaneous demand for CD-ROM is low and when response
                      time is not critical.


Combination file      Another option for networking CD-ROMs is to attach a CD-ROM
server/CD-ROM         player to an existing file server. This approach requires more
server                management, but at the same time, offers better and tighter
                      control than peer-to-peer network. The following list represents
                      several factors that may impact this type of network configuration:
                         amount of use the file server already supports
                         number of expansion slots available on the server
                         amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) available on the
                         file server
                         availability of personnel to swap CD-ROM discs
AFH 36-2235    Volume 4       1 November 2002                                      44




Dedicated CD-ROM   This approach of CD-ROM networking requires a dedicated
server             server for CD-ROMs. Multiple CD-ROM servers can be placed
                   on a network, making hundreds of CD-ROM drives accessible to
                   users without affecting other file server operations. Dedicated
                   servers offer excellent security and management.


Networking         It is possible for several computers to share a CD-ROM if the
CD-ROM             appropriate hardware and software are connected to a network.
                   These are considerations:

                      The system can be accessed throughout a classroom or even a
                      school.
                      Multiple users can significantly slow the response time.
                      CD-ROM applications must be network-compatible if they are to
                      operate properly for multiple access.
                      A multiple-use license is required.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 4          1 November 2002                                      45


                             Section C
                   CD-ROM Advantages and Limitations

Impact of CD-ROM   Although CD-ROM technology offers many educational and
technology         training benefits, it is not appropriate for every program. The
                   following features and limitations are to be considered.


Advantages              Point                              Impact
                   Storage            Each disc can store 683 megabytes or more of
                   capacity           data, graphics or sound. That capacity is
                                      equivalent to hundreds of floppy disks.
                   Portability        Discs are small and lightweight, an ideal
                                      medium for transporting data.
                   Durability         Discs are very durable. Fingerprints and slight
                                      scratches will not usually impair their
                                      performance. Discs are read with a laser beam,
                                      so there is no direct contact or wear on the disc
                                      as it is played.
                   Low cost of        Reproduction costs only pennies after the
                   replication        master is created.
                   Inexpensive        The cost of CD-ROM drives has decreased
                   hardware           dramatically in the past few years. Many
                                      computers now feature built-in drives.
                   Availability of    Several thousand commercial titles now
                   CD-ROM             available include a wide range of reference
                   programs           materials, multimedia applications, and
                                      government documents.
                   Speed              Although the access time of CD-ROM drives is
                                      slower than that of hard drives, the speed of the
                                      search time compared to manual methods is
                                      very impressive. This is another area where
                                      new technology is closing the speed access
                                      gap.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 4       1 November 2002                                       46




Limitations          Point                             Impact
                 Cost of          Some CD-ROM programs, including education
                 subscriptions    and training applications, require a subscription
                                  fee for updates. These fees can often be as
                                  much or more than the original purchase and
                                  should be budgeted as a life cycle cost.

                 Limited scope    Even though CD-ROMs hold an enormous
                                  amount of information, they are limited. If an
                                  application requires more than one disc, a
                                  multiple-disc player could be required.

                 Read only        CD-ROM discs cannot be changed. Although
                                  this may sometimes be an advantage, it
                                  complicates the revision and update process.
                                  CD-ROM technology is becoming available that
                                  will allow changes to be made.

                                Section D
            Commercial Applications from CD-ROM Technologies

CD-ROM                 The success of CD-ROM technology has created many spin-off
standards              technologies and applications. Each new product incorporates
                       the CD-ROM compact disc. Earlier difficulties with lack of
                       standardization of formatting of instructions and data on the discs
                       have been largely resolved.

                       CD-ROM standards began with what the industry calls the
                       "Yellow Book" developed by Sony and Phillips corporations.
                       These standards ensure uniform frame and sector architecture
                       and levels of data encoding and decoding. However, the issue of
                       cross-compatibility between players and computer platforms was
                       not addressed in the standards. This was resolved in what is
                       now called the "High Sierra" standard that organizes files and
                       indexes so that they can be accessed universally. As explained
                       in Burger (1993): The result is that any computer that has a
                       driver than can translate between its operating system and the
                       High Sierra standard can locate and access any file on a High
                       Sierra CD-ROM disc. Note that the data in the files on the disc
                       must be in a form compatible with the given application for the
                       contents to mean something. In other words, managers
                       purchasing CD-ROM programs should ensure that the disc is
                       formatted for their platform, either PC or Macintosh.

                              DIGITAL AUDIO

Technology       Digital audio is now a standard of multimedia systems. The
quick look       addition of sound to the visual media capabilities of the computer-
                 based systems is possible because:

                    Technological progress in analog-to-digital converters (ADC)
                    and digital-to-analog converters (DAC) has made digital audio
                    possible.
                    Audio recorded as numeric values allows digital computers to
                    capture, manipulate, store, and distribute sound.
                    Significant advantages of the digital audio system are:
                        Quality of sound is maintained.
                        Control of the audio media is now possible as an integral
                        medium of the computer-based multimedia system.


History          Until the 19th century, sound could be manipulated only
                 physically. More instruments, larger instruments, improved
                 design of concert halls were examples of attempts to enhance
                 sound. By the late 1800s, several inventors were trying to
                 convert sound waves to electronic sound. Their primary goal was
                 to amplify the sound, but success also led to the ability to store,
                 manipulate, copy and retrieve the sound for later presentation.

                 In nature, sound, light and electromagnetic waves are analog,
                 meaning their signals occur in smooth variations. Because
                 electricity is also analog, early electronics were also based in
                 analog. Modern electronics are digital, representing values as
                 numbers and in separate, discrete steps (as contrasted with
                 analog's smooth, flowing waveforms).

                 Today's multimedia electronics offer significant potential for
                 education and training. The instructor's ability to access and
                 store tremendous amounts of information and selectively develop
                 them into knowledge transfer systems and courses and present
                 them to students in clear, convenient, even motivating, ways
                 represents significant progress in the development of education
                 and training.

                                 Section A
                  Applications to Education and Training

Introduction        Digital audio adds the true sound dimension to multimedia in its
                    many and varied uses for educators and trainers. Potential uses
                    are essentially limited only by the creativity of the instructor and
                    course designer. Examples of applications and capabilities of
                    digital audio are:

                       Computer control
                       Sound-critical subject areas
                       Recording student inputs
                       Computer presentations in classroom
                       Re-purposing videodisc programs
                       Speech therapy
                       Music


Computer            With digitized sound, a computer treats a sound file just as it does
control             a text file. Editing sound files is similar to editing in word
                    processing programs. Precise control of quality sound to be
                    delivered as part of multimedia programs gives the CBT course
                    designer and the classroom instructor great flexibility in making
                    instruction effective.


Sound-critical      Most education and training programs that cover subjects in
subject areas       which sound is critical are enhanced by the use of digital audio.
                    Some examples are:

                       Language training, including pronunciation drills by students.
                       Diagnosing mechanical operations by the sounds produced,
                       such as jet engine runs and motor vehicle tuning.
                       Providing audible feedback to student inputs, such as
                       simulated radio transmissions to aircrew members rehearsing
                       missions.


Recording           Instructors and students can record their own voices or sound
student inputs      inputs on the computer system, storing them for future reference
                    or for providing immediate feedback or practice. With proper
                    CBT program design, students' aural inputs can be stored for
                    instructor monitoring and even end-of-course comparison.

Computer              Computer-controlled presentations, in the classroom or other
presentations in      audience environment, now include audio as well as visual
the classroom         elements. The computer system becomes a versatile
                      presentation tool for the instructor, replacing other less reliable
                      and unsynchronized systems.


Speech therapy        Programs can be used by speech and language therapists to
                      help people with speech impairments. Speech therapy programs
                      digitize and analyze verbal characteristics such as pitch,
                      loudness, and intonation. They also provide exercises on
                      pronunciation, pitch, and speech timing.


Music                 Music on computers and the internet is not well developed.
                      Music programs that interface midi devices are also standard.
                      Most music is now edited and even written using computer
                      programs.

                      Digital audio capability on computers has quickly become an
                      important means of creating and teaching music. Several
                      academic and commercial programs are available that focus on
                      music. They provide notation and composition, drill and practice
                      programs, and instruction in differentiating rhythm patterns,
                      pitches, and triads.

                              The Technology

The basics        Sound, which occurs naturally as an analog waveform, can be
                  converted to digital signals and recorded and stored as a file on a
                  computer's hard disk or on a compact disc. The file is controlled
                  by the computer program. It can be edited and otherwise
                  manipulated, and accessed for near-instantaneous output. The
                  output is converted from digital signals back to analog signals
                  and played through output devices, usually speakers.


How audio is      Sound is digitized through a sampling process. At small, discrete
digitized         time intervals, the computer takes a sample or reading of the
                  waveform. The number of samples taken within a second is the
                  "sampling rate." The result is a digital, stairstep-looking
                  representation of sound, as contrasted with the smooth-flow
                  analog waveform. See Figure 2.

AFH 36-2235     Volume 4       1 November 2002                                       55




Audio quality      The higher the sampling rate, the better the quality of the sound.
                   Note, however, that sampling higher rates, and thus quality,
                   requires greater use of storage. The controlling factor should be
                   the quality of sound needed to meet the objectives of the
                   education or training.

                   Your ear can be as good a judge of audio quality as the complex
                   specifications of the audio system. If audio is a critical
                   component of the system, find an opportunity to listen to
                   comparable systems under consideration.


Human hearing      The hearing range of most humans is approximately 20 hertz to
                   17 kilohertz. A hertz, abbreviated "Hz," is a unit of frequency
                   equal to one cycle per second; a kilohertz is 1,000 hertz.


Examples of        Figure 3 shows the frequency ranges of the human ear and some
frequency          media. The sampling rate should be twice the highest frequency
ranges             required. Thus, if a 4 kHz frequency is desired for a voice
                   application, the sampling rate should be 8 kHz or higher.

Music                 Music is generally higher-quality sound. Higher sampling rates
                      are recommended: at least 11 or 12 kHz and preferably up to 22
                      kHz.


Disc storage          Decisions about the quality of digital sound also relate to
requirements          available storage space. The following table illustrates the
                      tradeoff between sampling rates and storage requirements.

              Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Audio

Impact of digital      Digital audio offers many features for computer-controlled
audio features         sounds, but there are limitations to be considered. The following
                       tables highlight the considerations.


Advantages               Advantage               Impact
                       Random             Digital audio enables audio to be retrieved and
                       access             played instantly (on the order of milliseconds).
                                          In most systems, to access the audio, the user
                                          simply enters a "Play" command followed by the
                                          name of the file.
                       Ease of editing    Audio files are stored with a file name, just like
                                          other computer files. Audio files can be deleted
                                          or replaced simply by using file command
                                          utilities. Tools enable users to cut and paste
                                          sounds to edit narration. The process is as easy
                                          as using a word processor.
                       Cost               Moderate-cost, good-quality digital audio
                                          computer cards for computers are widely
                                          available. Newer Macintosh computers have
                                          built-in audio record and play capabilities.
                       Flexibility        Digital audio (as opposed to audio on a
                                          videodisc) is not tied to a particular video
                                          segment. Therefore, digital audio can be played
                                          in conjunction with any segment on a videodisc,
                                          if desired.
                       Limited only by    Analog audio on a videodisc is limited to 60
                       storage space      minutes per side. There is no limit to the
                                          amount of digital audio, other than that imposed
                                          by the amount of storage space available.

                                   into RAM first, before playing. A large RAM is

                          DIGITAL IMAGES AND VIDEO

Technology quick      Graphics, images, and video presentations are important parts of
look                  multimedia computer programs. Growing demand for interactivity
                      and for the means to manipulate the data are spurring progress in
                      the digital capture and storage of the data. A quick look at the
                      capabilities follows:

                         Capture devices are readily available to digitize inputs:
                             Scanners for print copies of text and graphics,
                             photographs, slides, and other still images.
                             Video digitizers and software to convert analog motion
                             image inputs from videotape, digital cameras, video
                             cameras, and broadcast television.
                             Data manipulation and editing devices and software
                             programs are readily available for many specialized
                             applications and processes.
                         Computers can store, copy, and distribute image data without
                         degradation of the data. Every image is as clear as the first.
                         Data converted into images can be output:
                         Directly to the computer screen for inclusion in multimedia
                         programs.
                         Through other playback devices such as television monitors,
                         printers, or networks.


History               Early efforts to include graphics in computer programs required
                      the talents of professional graphic artists and computer
                      programmers. Results were costly and limited. Photographic
                      representations were not possible.

                      The development of digitizing technologies, many similar to those
                      involved in the digitization of audio, has made possible the
                      incorporation of still and even motion images of all varieties.
                      These successes are at the foundation of the multimedia
                      programs that are extensively used today in education and
                      training arenas.

Element           their teaching of students. From printed texts to printed
                  photographic materials to slide shows, films and video, the visual
                  element has been common to transfer of knowledge.

                  Education's slow adoption of the computer to academic and
                  training tasks has been paced by the computer's developing
                  capability to include more interactive visual and sound elements
                  on a screen.

                        The Technology: Digital Still Images

Introduction            Still images (single images, as opposed to a series of images that
                        appear to have motion) are a mainstay of visual information
                        systems used in education and training. Still images include
                        photographs, drawings, charts and other graphics normally found
                        in print form or film.


Still-image basics      Computer systems work with digital information. The capture and
                        conversion of images from analog to digital form is the necessary
                        first step. Once digitized, the data can be creatively edited or
                        manipulated or combined, then stored, and then output in a
                        means useful to the educator or trainer.


Advantages of           Perhaps one of the best advantages is the editing capability from
scanned images          programs like Photo shop. It is possible to combine images,
                        modify images. In fact commercial photographers now do their
                        retouching on programs like Photo Shop rather than directly on
                        the negative.

                            Advantages                         Examples
                        Reduces                A graphic artist can scan images faster

                        graphics               produced with a scanner. Users can
                                               capture complex graphics (e.g.,
                                               photographs) that are difficult or
                                               impossible to create using computer
                                               graphics programs.
                        No typing to capture   Scanners eliminates the need to re-type
                        text                   text. Scanners using Optical Character

                                               words from a page into a text file. This
                                               file can be edited with word-processing
                                               software.

                         Disadvantages                       Examples
                      Accuracy               Scanners with OCR software achieve
                                             various levels of accuracy depending on
                                             the font and typeface scanned. If the
                                             software cannot scan with a high degree
                                             of accuracy, you may spend more time
                                             cleaning up the file than you saved by
                                             scanning it.
                      Memory                 Computers must have a large RAM
                      requirements           capacity to scan in large graphics.
                      Storage                After an image is scanned, a large
                      requirements           amount of disk space is required to store
                                             it. The file size of each image may be
                                             several megabytes. New compression
                                             technology is quickly relieving this
                                             problem.


Capturing still       The most efficient way to capture still images is with a graphics
images                scanner; a computer peripheral designed to convert print
                      materials into digital data. The scanner works much like a
                      photocopy machine, except that its output is not a paper copy but
                      an image transferred to a computer screen. Once on the screen,
                      the image data can be changed, output to other devices, or
                      stored in the computer memory.

                      There are many other options. Most photo processing will now
                      provide digitized photos. You can have your film processed and
                      placed on a web site for downloading. Digital cameras have
                      improved in quality and reduced in price.

How a scanner        Most scanners are "flatbed scanners." As in photocopying, the
works                graphic is placed on the glass surface, a light is passed under it,
                     and the resulting signals are readable by a computer.

                     When images or text materials are scanned, the computer sees a
                     collection of dots. The dot is normally called a "pixel." Each pixel
                     can be changed in color, brightness, location, and size. This
                     control of the elements of what the user sees as an image is the
                     greatest advantage offered by the digitization of visuals.


Scanning slides      Many flatbed scanners offer optional devices for digitizing slides.
                     Specialized slide scanners offer better control and resolution of
                     the image. As with all scanning processes, the quality required
                     by the eventual use of the image is the major factor driving the
                     level of resolution.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 4       1 November 2002                                      67




Scanning text       Scanning text into a computer requires the addition of optical
                    character recognition (OCR) software. High-end or specialized
                    scanners often include the software. Until the OCR is added, the
                    computer sees scanned text as pixels, just dark or light dots, not
                    as letters or numbers. Many OCR packages are available; the
                    user pays a price for accuracy and flexibility.

                    Managers must weigh the cost of the OCR-capable scanner with
                    the time saved by not having to re-key the text into the computer.


Scanner             Scanners come in many shapes and sizes, from a $40 hand-held
equipment           model to a multi-thousand-dollar, high-resolution, color-capable
                    model with OCR software. Macintosh, IBM and compatible
                    computers usually require cabling the scanner to the computer.
                    The software required to control the scanner and read the image
                    normally comes with the scanner equipment.

Frame grabbers      "Frame grabbing" is a useful technique to capture a still photo or
                    one frame of video motion, digitize it and save it on the computer.
                    The input signal goes through the digitizing card and is played in
                    a window on the computer screen. When the wanted frame
                    appears, a keyed command grabs and files it. From this point,
                    the image is a still image and can be worked accordingly
AFH 36-2235        Volume 4       1 November 2002                                      68




Image resolution      The resolution or clarity level of the image to be scanned into the
                      computer should be based on the eventual use of the image. For
                      example, if it will become a product to be printed on a laser
                      printer, a resolution of 300 dots-per-inch would be appropriate.
                      However, if the image will remain a computer product, a
                      resolution of 72 dots-per-inch would work. Scanning at higher
                      resolution rates impacts disk storage space.


Memory and            Scanners require large amounts of random access memory
storage               (RAM) to capture images and much storage space to store them
requirements          (up to a megabyte for some images). These requirements dictate
                      reasonable planning on the number and resolution of images to
                      be scanned. The recommended technique is to scan only the
                      area of the graphic wanted, preview it on the computer screen
                      and make adjustments before saving it to the computer storage.

Clarification of      Distinguishing between television and video can be a lesson in
terms: video and      futility. The technologies are inseparable, and what happens in
television            television impacts the field of video. The following perspective of
                      the two may be useful:
                          Television has to do with the broadcast or cable system
                          delivery of someone else's programming on a timetable
                          determined by someone else.
                          Video has to do with the ability to record, edit and play back
                          programming on the user's schedule.


Similarities to       As with still images discussed in Section B, the digitizing of video
digital still         images represents a major advancement in computer technology,
images                an advancement of great use to educators and trainers. The
                      capture and use of video images requires converting analog
                      signals to digital data. A review of analog and digital issues, as
                      they relate to video, will be useful at this point.


Analog versus         Analog video systems have been successful since their
digital               development in the 1930s. There was little consideration to
                      converting television and the supporting video technologies from
                      analog to digital formats as long as the digital technology did not
                      offer economic and other outweighing advantages. Many experts
                      see the current period as the transition period in which the
                      transformation is taking place. The following table contrasts
                      some of the important aspects of analog and digital systems

How video is          To digitize video from a camcorder, videotape, videodisc, or
digitized             broadcast television, the input signal must be processed through
                      a digitizing card added to the computer, or through a peripheral.
                      This converts the analog video signals into digital bits of
                      information for each pixel (picture element) of the computer
                      screen. The software that comes with the digitization cards
                      controls the process. Video images can be filed from the screen
                      to the hard disk (which requires a large storage space) or can be
                      output for playback or transmission to other devices, such as a
                      printer.

                         colors and shades makes digital images appear not to blend
                         well. Some images appear to have sharp, striped edges.
                         Sufficient memory and storage capability. Digital images (and
                         sound) require large amounts of memory for processing and
                         storage of digital data. The current compromise of recording
                         data at lower quality levels is not always satisfactory.

The impetus for       The industry is committed to overcoming the difficulties for these
digitizing video      reasons:

                         Error-free format. Digital systems, based on few, discrete
                         values (usually 1 and 0), can reproduce and transmit data
                         error-free.
                         Potential for interactivity. Digital systems, incorporating the
                         excellent control capabilities of the computer, provide more
                         intricate branching and integration possibilities. The result is
                         systems that are largely individually tailored. The user is
                         given a degree of control.
                         Ease of manipulation. Digital data can be resized, recolored,
                         repositioned, and duplicated with relative ease and without the
                         high costs of analog video editing equipment.
                         Durability. Digital data can be reproduced without any loss of
                         quality. No "noise" is introduced into copies ("snow" in video
                         or "hiss" in audio). This is important to transmitting data over
                         a network, such as in networked classrooms at the Air Force
                         Academy and local area networks at training facilities or
                         between them and students across the base.


Interactivity         The control possible with digital media exceeds the interactivity of
compared to           the videodisc (also known as interactive video). The videodisc is
videodisc             analog and its user can only access, not change, what the
                      designer put on the disc. With digital media, users can control
                      and change the content, sequence, and transitions.


Current status        Air Force education and training managers must note that the
and near-term         television broadcasting industry is converting to High Definition
changes               Television (HDTV) and digital format. At the time of this writing
                      (late 1993), the recently concluded National Association of
                      Broadcasters annual meeting ended with experts and
                      government officials stating: Make the transition to digital.
                      (Multimedia & Videodisc Monitor, June 1993)

                      The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been
                      testing competing HDTV systems proposed by industry teams.
                      The four competitors have agreed to form an alliance, essentially
                      merging aspects of all proposals. The FCC has told all broadcast
                      operations to have some HDTV broadcast capability by the year
                      2000. The full transition is forecast by 2010.

Impact of the      Video technology essentially follows television technology. The
standards          developing standards will focus emerging digital video
                   technologies. The impact on education and training is a natural

                     saving it to the drive. Known as "video-in-a-window," the
                     technique uses a real-time video display card to digitize and
                     display motion video at the full-motion rate, directly from the
                     analog source. Video-in-a-window does not save the video.

                    MEDIA INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY

Introduction         All multimedia productions require a software program to tie
                     together and control the various media that can be called into the
                     presentation. Media integration package is the general term for
                     these software programs. Development of media integration
                     programs is a continuing thrust, because progress in this and
                     related fields facilitates the development and delivery of
                     multimedia computer-based programs of value to education and
                     training.


Terminology and      These broad categorizations help the novice's understanding of
categories           software development:

                        Media integration packages. As noted in the introduction, this is
                        the umbrella term for software programs that pull together the
                        many media elements and control the flow of the product.
                        Presentation software. These programs are usually entry-level
                        software for creating the traditional slide show.
                        Multimedia production software. These programs pull together
                        the several media (text, graphics, sound, animation, video [even
                        smell is now possible]) programs and synchronize their working
                        together.
                        Authoring systems. This category refers to software programs
                        used to prepare productions. It includes software that accesses
                        databases and controls calling external information into the
                        system for incorporation into the new production.


Blurring of          Note, however, that the lines between these categories are now
categories           blurred. The thrust in software development is to simplify the
                     production requirements of the user. In education and training, the
                     thrust should lead to simplified development of courses and
                     materials and to more flexibility for instructors.

limitation           dynamic to allow a one-time, comprehensive summation. The
                     following areas have been chosen to give managers a sense of
                     some of the activities and trends that are underway. These areas
                     have been chosen because of their relevance and utility to the
                     many people and levels of education and training in the Air Force.

                        Internal tools
                        Clip media
                        Timing and synchronization
                        Database support
                        Cross-platform compatibility


Internal tools       The software "tools" used to create and edit media programs are
                     often included in the package. Generally, the internal tool set that
                     comes with program will satisfy the user's need to accomplish the
                     intended purpose. However, more extensive tools in the form of
                     other specific application software are almost always available.
                     More experienced developers may prefer the added
                     sophistication. The trend today is to bundle significant tool
                     programs with the creation/editing package.


Clip media           Many manufacturers of media integration packages are
                     increasing the media libraries content of their products. The
                     ready availability of clip art, music, stock photos, and animation
                     makes deadline products easier to accomplish. The quick and
                     inexpensive creation of a satisfactory product often is the better
                     choice of more talented, sophisticated individual inputs to a
                     product.


Timing and           The correct timing of the input and output of a program's
synchronization      elements is critical to a multimedia production. It is as simple as
                     having sound and visual in synchronization. Timing and playback
                     are complicated by the processes used for each medium, the
                     processing speed of the computers, the size of the digital data
                     files, and many other factors. The solution has been developed
                     in the form of equipment and software that establishes an
                     absolute timing reference.

Database support      Extensive interactive productions may include the ability to
                      access databases. This is useful to allow the user to search for
                      all related information in the area of interest. Those databases
                      may be text, sound, graphic, and visual. Some interactive
                      productions also allow the user to input additional information into
                      the databases. These features, though adding cost to the
                      production, can significantly enhance the educational and training
                      effectiveness.


Cross-platform        Multimedia producers have not satisfied this need. Programs
compatibility         created on one platform generally do not play on another. A
                      limited number of programs are designed in versions for both
                      Macintosh and IBM-compatibles and can be transported for play
                      on the other platform.

                                  Hypermedia

The hyperlink      The ability to link information to related information is the key to
concept            the thought process. Sensory perceived information has
                   traditionally been recorded in a linear fashion, such as sequential
                   frame after frame, and musical note after note. The human brain,
                   however, has the ability to search knowledge and experience
                   memories to connect directly and indirectly related information
                   into new patterns. Humans are now teaching computer systems
                   to perform similarly. The linking of information in this concept is
                   called "hyperlink."


Multimedia +       Combining the hyperlink concept with computer-based
hyperlink =        multimedia production capability has introduced the term
hypermedia         "hypermedia."


Definition of      Hypermedia is a computerized non-linear system in which
hypermedia         information elements are linked such that the user can choose
                   alternate paths to reach all related elements of information. In a
                   multimedia system, the information elements can be in text,
                   sound, graphic, video, and even olfactory form.


A hypermedia       The opening screen of a hypermedia application on the F-16
program            aircraft shows a graphic of the aircraft. Unseen behind the
example            graphic are several areas, called "buttons," which allow the user
                   to choose a part of the aircraft to investigate. If the student
                   selects the landing gear area of the graphic, another screen
                   appears with a close-up of the gear. Selection of the wheel hub
                   brings up a motion clip of the disassembly of the hub, or the
                   brakes, or the hydraulic system, or any related areas which the
                   student chooses to pursue.

                                Section C
            Hypermedia Applications for Educators and Trainers

Value for              Educators and trainers can now apply the power of hypermedia
educators              applications to courses that enable students to choose
                       information in the combinations and sequence that make it most
                       comprehensible.


Examples of            Hypermedia development offers the following educational and
applications           training incentives:

                          Tool for database management
                          Preparation for presentations
                          Development of handout materials
                          Design of instructional materials
                          Control of multimedia devices
                          Share hypermedia creations


Tool for database      Many hypermedia programs were designed as databases and
management             are excellent for storing and retrieving various formats of
                       information. Using hypermedia, course developers and
                       instructors can create their own database managers, such as an
                       inventory of equipment or videodisc images.


Preparation for        Hypermedia programs are quick tools for creating impressive
presentations          presentations. Electronic presentations (rather than static
                       overheads) offer the advantages of last-minute changes, dynamic
                       input from the audience, and special transitional effects. A
                       projection system, connected to the computer, is needed to
                       project for a large group.


Development of         Many hypermedia programs offer excellent options for creating
handout                handouts. If a hypermedia program is used as a presentation
materials              tool, copies of the screens can be printed, even printing up to 32
                       screens on the same sheet of paper.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 4       1 November 2002                                         83




Design of           Hypermedia programs have revolutionized authoring systems;
instructional       the computer programs designed specifically to create computer-
materials           based instruction. For example, to create a multiple-choice
                    question with hypermedia, an invisible button is placed over each
                    possible answer. When a student selects an incorrect answer,
                    the student will activate the button. This brings up feedback
                    about the incorrect answer or another chance to answer the
                    question. When the student selects the correct answer, the
                    button will instruct the program to go on to the next question.


Control of          Most hypermedia programs provide an easy way to control
multimedia          videodiscs, sounds, and CD-ROMs. Using a hypermedia
devices             program to access a variety of different media is also referred to
                    as multimedia.


Shared              Copyright and licensing restrictions often curtail the distribution of
hypermedia          computer programs—even those you create yourself. Most
creations           hypermedia programs, however, allow developers to distribute
                    their programs freely, without a license agreement. This
                    distribution freedom has resulted in the availability of many
                    hypermedia programs through bulletin boards and shareware
                    organizations.


DoD guidelines      DoD instruction 1322.20 requires that commercial software
on commercial       programs used to develop interactive courseware be delivered to
software            the government with unlimited rights for use.

                               Section D
               Overview of Leading Hypermedia Programs

Overview           Most hypermedia development tools are based on a screen-and-
                   object format. Each screen can contain a variety of objects,
                   including fields, buttons, and graphics. See Figure 7. Also, each
                   screen has two layers, foreground and background, and each can
                   have objects.

Common terms       These commonly used terms have the following meanings:

                   Computer Based Training (CBT) – The use of computers to
                   facilitate learning. Also called computer-aided instruction (CAI),
                   computer-aided learning (CAL), computer-based instruction
                   (CBI), and computer-based learning (CBL).

                                                                   Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235    Volume 4       1 November 2002                                           85




Common terms         Interface – The interface within computer based training what
(Continued)          you see on the computer screen. Some examples of
                     elements that make up the interface are buttons, graphics,
                     text, and lesson titles. A good interface will have consistency
                     between screen elements on all screens. For example
                     navigation buttons are in the same location, same color, and
                     same size on every screen.
                     Fields are designed to contain text and are like small word
                     processing blocks.
                     Buttons – Buttons are designated areas or objects on the
                     screen that can initiate an action, such as branching to
                     another screen, playing an audio file, or starting an animation
                     sequence.
                     Graphics – Graphics are objects that are on the screen. They
                     can be photographs computer generated images, or clip art.
                     Video – Video that is used in computer-based training is
                     digital video compressed into a format that computers are
                     capable of playing. There are many different video formats
                     each having different features based on file size, picture
                     clarity, and screen size.
                     Sound Files – Sound files that are used within multimedia can
                     come in many different formats based on the file's
                     compression. The actual file can be a person's voice music or
                     a combination of both.
                     Executable (exe) – An executable is the format that a
                     multimedia piece is compressed or packaged into when the
                     development is complete. This allows the multimedia piece to
                     run or be executed without the need of the development tool.
                     An executable lesson could have the name "Lesson.exe".
                     Web Site – In technical terms a web site is a computer that
                     hosts web pages and makes those documents available on
                     the World Wide Web. In layman's terms it is a collection of
                     web pages on the Internet that are interconnected with
                     hyperlinks. For example if you created a web site for your
                     family. You may have a link for your photos of your children, a
                     link for the next family reunion, a link that lists all birthday, etc.
                     Web Page – A web page is one screen on the Internet.

Examples of            There are many types of software products that are used to
multimedia             develop multimedia. The following are some common products
development            that are used to make interactive training courses and other types
products               of multimedia presentations. The following software packages
                       are examples only, and are not to be construed as an
                       endorsement by the Air Force.


HyperCard              HyperCard introduced by Apple Computer in 1987. It was one of
                       the first widely used development tools to create interactive
                       multimedia. HyperCard is a card/scripting authoring system
                       currently in version 2.4.1. It runs natively on both 68K and Power
                       Macintosh machines, and is widely used because of its easy
                       availability. Its largest drawback is the lack of integrated color.


Authorware Attain      Authorware Attain created by Macromedia runs on Windows, NT,
                       WWW (via WebPlayer). Currently in version 5.0, this software
                       uses icons placed in different locations along a flowline.
                       Authorware supports jumping between files, jumping out to other
                       applications and even printing from them. This has unparalleled
                       external media support, and can encapsulate all non-motion
                       media content into apps and content libraries, or leave media files
                       external for dynamic access. Authorware supports character-
                       styled text and extensive navigation structures including
                       hypertext. This tool is optimal for CBT and rapid prototyping.


ToolBook               Toolbook II is owned by Asymetrix it runs on Windows, NT,
                       WWW (via Neuron), and uses Java. Toolbook is a card/scripting
                       authoring system now broken into components: Instructor, the
                       standard tool; Assistant, the pre-built templates; CBT Systems,
                       optimized for CBT production; and CMS Plus, a course-
                       management system. Toolbook includes database linkage, MCI
                       compliance and many examples (called "Widgets") of interactivity.
                       This newest version exports HTML and Java for Web delivery.

IconAuthor       IconAuthor which is owned by Asymetrix runs on Windows, NT,
                 Solaris, UNIX, WWW (via Windows). IconAuthor follows the
                 iconic/flow control paradigm. The biggest strength of this
                 program is its included data handling, which makes it
                 unparalleled for CBT data tracking. The latest version should also
                 provide WWW porting of existing content. A weakness is its
                 internal "Move Object" path animation feature, which can be
                 jerky.


HTML             Hypertext Mark-up Language or HTML is the basic language that
                 web pages are created in. There are many development tools
                 that are used today to simplify the development process by
                 utilizing features of the software to do the coding for you. A
                 simple example is Microsoft Word, you can create simple
                 document and then save it as an HTML document and open it up
                 on the web. Two other more common and complex HTML

              Hypermedia Advantages and Disadvantages

Hypermedia        Hypermedia programs offer flexibility and a production system
                  that can be effectively used in education and training. As with
                  other technologies, hypermedia also has some disadvantages.
                  The following tables detail hypermedia advantages and
                  disadvantages.


Advantages              Point                            Impact
                  Inexpensive       In comparison with comparable computer
                                    software, hypermedia programs are
                                    inexpensive—$100 to $300, with discounts for
                                    educators and students. In many cases, the price
                                    includes the rights to distribute created programs.
                  Easy to learn     Sophisticated hypermedia programs can be
                                    created with fields, buttons, and graphic objects,
                                    without requiring the scripting component. With
                                    only a few hours invested, most users can create
                                    lessons and presentations.
                  Easy to store     Computer-based slide shows created with
                                    hypermedia are easy to store and modify.
                  Multimedia        Hypermedia programs offer easy links to
                  links             graphics, sound video, and CD-ROM.
                  Fun               Instructors have the power to create motivating,
                                    interactive programs.
                  Exportation       Hypermedia applications allow users to build their
                  and               own associations between bits of information,
                  association       based on their interests. Well-designed
                                    hypermedia programs can both motivate and
                                    assist students to explore a topic.

Disadvantages           Point                               Impact
                   Confusion          Poorly designed hypermedia programs can
                                      easily turn into hyper-chaos, where the user has
                                      too many choices and gets lost. Research is
                                      continuing to determine the optimal number of
                                      selections per screen and the best methods to
                                      promote learning in a hypermedia environment.
                   Complex to         Although the object level (buttons, fields, etc.) is
                   learn at           relatively easy to learn, novices can quickly get
                   scripting level    lost and frustrated with scripting languages.
                   Difficult to       One of the applications for hypermedia is to
                   project            create interactive, dynamic computer slide
                                      shows. The problem is that some schools still
                                      do not have the equipment to project the shows
                                      for presentations. This situation is improving
                                      every day.
                   Platform-          Most hypermedia programs are generally
                   specific           restricted to one platform. If you create a slide
                                      show with the ToolBook authoring system, it will
                                      require an IBM computer with Microsoft
                                      Windows to run the program.
                   Delivery fees      In some cases, a developer may be required to
                   and files          pay a publication fee for delivery of an
                                      application. In other cases, the delivery files are
                                      free, but may be extremely large, making them
                                      difficult to distribute on floppy diskettes.

                          COMPUTER NETWORKS

Introduction      The benefits of computer use can be multiplied in many
                  organizations by linking individual computers into a network.
                  These benefits normally include the sharing of files (more than
                  one user can access the same information) and the sharing of
                  software programs and printers. Most Air Force installations
                  have computer networks, and many organizations, including
                  education and training units, successfully use the base network
                  and even some specialized networks devoted to their specific
                  missions.


Managers'         Networking computers is a very technically demanding process.
network           Most managers should not attempt to master the technicalities.
concerns          Get the help of an expert; even an outside expert if necessary.
                  Note also that decisions involving establishing or upgrading
                  existing networks are major resource- and mission-impacting
                  decisions. Costs range from a few hundred dollars to network all
                  computers in an office to hundreds of thousands of dollars for
                  complex networks for very high-speed data sharing by maximum
                  number of users at several facilities. Managers need to get
                  expert help for network design and the necessary cost analysis.
                  However, the benefits of a well-designed, adequately supported
                  network are often the measure of success in the successful use
                  of computers to support education and training.


Terminology       Managers will benefit from a quick review of the common terms
                  associated with computer networks.

                     A network or net, for short, is a cable system that links
                     individual workstation computers to each other through a
                     central network server computer.
                     A local area network or LAN, for short, is the network that
                     links the individual computers in one building or on one base.
                     LANs are limited by physical distance, by types of cabling
                     available, and for practical reasons by the number of
                     workstations served by the one network.

                                                                Continued on next page

Terminology             A workstation is the user's computer. If attached to the
(Continued)             network's centralized files capability, the workstation may lack
                        its own storage capability. If the workstation is capable of
                        processing and storing data independently of the network, the
                        workstation is called a stand-alone.
                        A server on the network is one computer that coordinates the
                        operation of the network; the server is not available as a
                        workstation. Most networks also have a second server, a
                        printer server that allows all workstations on the net to share
                        one printer.


In this chapter      Though managers are not expected to be technical experts,
                     knowing the basics of computer networks will assist in decision
                     making in this area. To that end, this chapter covers these topics

                   Applications for Education and Training

Introduction          Although the initial investment in a school LAN can be high, the
                      operation of a well-used, properly designed and maintained LAN
                      will cost less over a period of time than will the operation of a
                      group of stand-alone computers. LAN advantages include:

                         Instructor monitoring of student work
                         Developer access to software, files
                         Student access to references, databases
                         Group-study classroom projects
                         School management enhancements


Monitoring            A properly configured network will allow the instructor to monitor
student work          each student's work. This provides feedback to the instructor and
                      allows affirmations or further instruction for the student. Course
                      materials can include tests at appropriate junctures, administered
                      over the network, with tracking of individual scores and
                      automated record keeping. When necessary, the student and
                      instructor need not be in close proximity.


Assistance to         Course developers, by sharing development software and
developers            reference materials and jointly developed files, can increase their
                      productivity through use of a network.


Student benefits      Students no longer have to relocate to access reference
                      materials and databases previously available only by moving to a
                      central location. The network serves as the bridge to the sources
                      that can be shared by many students simultaneously.


Group study           Groups of students can be teamed to work computer-assisted
projects              projects. Team members can share text, graphics, and inputs
                      from reference sources. The network allows the work to
                      continue, even if the students are not in the same classroom.

School            The network's linking of student machines with the instructor
management        machine, and all machines with the administration office, can be
enhancements      used to automate many of the administrative functions required:
                  grade/progress tracking and recording, attendance, time logged,
                  references used, and so forth.

                  A network also simplifies the purchase and control of software
                  programs. A site license allows a centrally stored program to be
                  shared with many users on the net. Some networks also have an
                  automated means of inventorying all equipment connected to the
                  net.

Introduction        Most managers will not be directly involved in the design and
                    installation of a computer network. The basic rule is get the
                    expert involved. However, the manager will benefit from
                    understanding the basic design, hardware and software
                    presented in this section.


Network design      Two major considerations are notable:
considerations
                       Experts describe the design of a network as "topology," the
                       shape it would take when illustrated on paper. Common
                       topologies include the star, ring, tree, and line. Each has
                       strengths and weaknesses, and the application of the network
                       becomes the deciding factor. See Figure 8.
                       Data speed, the rate at which different networks can transfer
                       data, varies by network. When an expert can design higher
                       data transfer rate into the network, more workstations can be
                       used at the same time. Generally, the more users on a
                       network, the slower the data transfer rate. However, the
                       experts consider many factors beyond number of users.

Hybrid design         Computer network experts are likely to develop hybrids of the
networks              typology and cabling outlined above. Hybrids are often most
                      effective, especially when location of workstation and servers,
                      frequency of equipment change-out, and existing facility
                      considerations are weighed.


Network hardware      Beyond the computer workstations themselves, there are several
considerations        hardware elements involved with networking. The most important
                      are discussed below.

                         The cabling that physically links the elements of the network is
                         also a matter of design requirements and cost. For example,
                         the total amount of cable required varies with the topology; but
                         additional cable can create redundant paths so the network
                         will remain operational even if one section of cable is
                         damaged. A quick look at three common cable types, from
                         least to most expensive, follows:
                               Twisted pairs. The wiring literally has two wires twisted
                               together and is the same as that commonly used for
                               telephone lines. If unused telephone lines exist in the
                               building where the network is to be installed, they could
                               be used to link computers. Twisted pairs are significantly
                               vulnerable to interference that can disrupt the network.
                               Coaxial cable. This cable is very similar to that used for
                               television signals. The same coaxial cable can support
                               network and television signals simultaneously. Coaxial
                               cable is almost immune to external interference. This
                               cable is expensive.
                               Fiber optic cable. This cable has fine fibers of glass
                               rather than metal wiring inside. Light, not electricity, is
                               conducted. It offers very-high-speed data transmission,
                               including video and audio capabilities in the same cable.
                               It is immune to all forms of electrical interference because
                               no metal is present. Fiber optic cable is very expensive,
                               and difficult to install and modify.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Network hardware         Network interface cards must be added to each computer in
considerations           the network. The cards affect the topology, cabling, and data
(Continued)              transmission of the network. Many networks are named for
                         the cards. For example, one IBM network interface card
                         package for a ring topology and token-passing data protocol is
                         named "Token Ring." Other well-known packages are
                         Ethernet and Arcnet. No two systems are directly compatible,
                         but techniques do exist to bridge individual networks of
                         different types.

                         The file server is the computer that serves the network as
                         both repository for all applications software programs and as
                         traffic director for files going to workstations. Because of the
                         critical role of the file server, there should be no compromising
                         on file server features. IBM and compatible servers should be
                         minimum 80386 central processor running at minimum of 33
                         megahertz. Macintosh systems should be Model SE-30 or
                         higher.

                         A printer server is the network's computer dedicated to
                         managing the printing function between all computers and
                         printers on the network. An older or minimum capability
                         computer will normally handle the printer server duties.

                         Workstations are standard computers with a network interface
                         card installed and used by a worker. A hard disk drive on a
                         workstation is redundant; the network server serves the
                         purpose. However, workstations that require stand-alone
                         capabilities will have hard disk drives.


Network software      Network software requirements are in two categories:

                         Management software. These programs include enhanced
                         diagnostics, workstation monitoring, and automatic equipment
                         inventory.

                         Applications software. These programs include those
                         available to support educational applications: computer-
                         assisted instruction, word processing, database management,
                         and other applications.

Network software       Software programs come with a license that specifies the
licensing              conditions under which it can be used. It is illegal to use software
                       on a network unless specifically stated on the agreement. The
                       software license will indicate how many users may use the
                       software at one time.


Software               Many single-user programs simply will not work on a network.
incompatibilities      Loading them will cause the work of multiple users to scramble.


Network protocols      A protocol is a set of rules that governs the communications
                       between computers on a network. These rules include guidelines
                       that regulate the access method, allowed physical topologies,
                       types of cabling, and speed of data transfer.

                       The most common protocols are:

                          Ethernet
                          LocalTalk
                          Token ring
                          Fiber distributed data interface
AFH 36-2235     Volume 4       1 November 2002                                      98




Ethernet           The Ethernet protocol is by far the most widely used. Ethernet
                   uses an access method called Carrier Sense Multiple
                   Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). This is a system where
                   each computer listens to the cable before sending anything
                   through the network. If the network is clear, the computer will
                   transmit. If some other node is already transmitting on the cable,
                   the computer will wait and try again when the line is clear.
                   Sometimes, two computers attempt to transmit at the same
                   instant. When this happens, a collision occurs. Each computer
                   then backs off and waits a random amount of time before
                   attempting to retransmit. With this access method, it is normal to
                   have collisions. The delay caused by collisions and re-
                   transmitting is very small and does not effect the speed of
                   transmission on the network.

                   The Ethernet protocol allows for linear bus, star, or tree
                   topologies. Data can be transmitted over twisted pair, coaxial, or
                   fiber optic cable at a speed of 10 Mbps.


Fast Ethernet      To allow for an increased speed of transmission, the Ethernet
                   protocol has developed a new standard that supports 100 Mbps.
                   This is commonly referred to as Fast Ethernet. Fast Ethernet
                   requires the use of different, more expensive network
                   concentrators/hubs and network interface cards. Also, Category 5
                   twisted pair or fiber optic cable is necessary.


LocalTalk          LocalTalk is a network protocol that was developed by Apple
                   Computer, Inc. for Macintosh computers. The method used by
                   LocalTalk is called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
                   Avoidance (CSMA/CA). It is similar to CSMA/CD except that a
                   computer signals its intent to transmit before it actually does so.
                   LocalTalk adapters and special twisted pair cable can be used to
                   connect a series of computers through the serial port. The
                   Macintosh operating system allows the establishment of a peer-
                   to-peer network without the need for additional software. With the
                   addition of the server version of AppleShare software, a
                   client/server network can be established. The LocalTalk protocol
                   allows for linear bus, star, or tree topologies using twisted pair
                   cable. A primary disadvantage of LocalTalk is speed. Its speed of
                   transmission is only 230 Kbps.

Token Ring             IBM developed the Token Ring protocol in the mid-1980s. The
                       access method used involves token-passing. In Token Ring, the
                       computers are connected so that the signal travels around the
                       network from one computer to another in a logical ring. A single
                       electronic token moves around the ring from one computer to the
                       next. If a computer does not have information to transmit, it
                       simply passes the token on to the next workstation. If a computer
                       wishes to transmit and receives an empty token, it attaches data
                       to the token. The token then proceeds around the ring until it
                       comes to the computer for which the data is meant. At this point,
                       the receiving computer captures the data. The Token Ring
                       protocol requires a star-wired ring using twisted pair or fiber optic
                       cable. It can operate at transmission speeds of 4 Mbps or 16
                       Mbps. Due to the increasing popularity of Ethernet, the use of
                       Token Ring in school environments has decreased.


Fiber distributed      Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a network protocol that
data interface         is used primarily to interconnect two or more local area networks,
                       often over large distances. The access method used by FDDI
                       involves token-passing. FDDI uses a dual ring physical topology.
                       Transmission normally occurs on one of the rings. However, if a
                       break occurs, the system keeps information moving by
                       automatically using portions of the second ring to create a new
                       complete ring. A major advantage of FDDI is speed. It operates
                       over fiber optic cable at 100 Mbps.

                                 Section C
                          Management Considerations

Careful planning      Managers are reminded that the networking of computer systems
required              brings both benefits and significant costs. The detailed input of a
                      knowledgeable network designer is required and worth the
                      investment.


Cost                  In addition to the costs of the hardware and software
considerations        requirements evident from the preceding sections, the following
                      can add to or subtract from the initial and life-cycle costs of a
                      network:

                         Wiring and the labor costs to install it can be considerable. In
                         an existing facility, present wiring in the form of unused
                         telephone lines or spare-capacity television cables could be a
                         major saving.
                         Software changeover costs must be identified. If the unit has
                         emphasized specific software in the past, determine the costs
                         of changing it to a version that will be network-compatible. If it
                         is not convertible, search further for hidden costs involved with
                         converting existing data files and databases to the new
                         network software.
                         Most network costs are front-end-loaded. The budget
                         definition process must adequately plan for the expenditure. A
                         cost analysis will be most helpful.
                         Network costs continue through the life of the network.
                         Anticipate and budget for maintenance costs and upgrade
                         costs that are predictable for the network system.
                         Manpower considerations are also relevant. The basic
                         activities of monitoring and upgrading a major network will
                         require manpower; even it is only a few hours a day. Every
                         network needs a resident manager.


Organizational        The importance of networking computers in an organization
attitude              strongly suggests the forming of a planning team to consider the
                      technological goals of the organization, work force
                      considerations, and budgetary requirements. The benefits of the
                      network to the organization should be well defined over the years
                      of anticipated use.

                            Section D
                   Advantages and Disadvantages

Computer         The networking of computers effectively broadens the capabilities
networking       of the computer users. There are also potential disadvantages.
                 The following tables detail the features and limitations of
                 computer networks.


Advantages               Point                              Impact
                 Connectivity           No networks offer efficiency through
                                        connectivity. All network workstations can
                                        share hardware and software resources,
                                        including printers, programs and information
                                        in databases.
                 Centralized            If computers are used in an instructional
                 management of          setting, the network allows a centralized
                 students               approach to managing the learning process.
                                        A courseware management program allows
                                        an instructor to evaluate the progress of any
                                        learner. Notes can be left for individual
                                        students, and teachers can interact directly
                                        with students who are currently working on
                                        the network.
                 Control of             Because all applications software programs
                 software against       are stored and managed through the file
                 pirating               server, network management software
                                        controls access to the software. It is even
                                        possible to install diskless workstations that
                                        make it impossible to copy programs or to
                                        infect the system with computer viruses.
                 Ease of updating       Software is easy to update or change
                 or adding              because only one copy of each program
                 software               exists on the file server. Only the file server
                                        copy need be updated. All workstations use
                                        that single copy of the software.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 4           1 November 2002                                    102




Disadvantages              Point                              Impact
                   File server            Perhaps the greatest weakness in any LAN is
                   failure                that a failure in the file server will stop the
                                          whole system. Proper attention to LAN
                                          maintenance will prevent most serious
                                          problems from happening.
                   Cable damage           Problems with network cables can cause
                                          anything from minor interruptions to failures.
                                          Large, complex LANs might require complex
                                          diagnostic tools to locate and correct cable
                                          problems.
                   Daily system           Networks need daily management. New
                   management             users must be registered before they can use
                                          the LAN. Software must be updated or added
                                          on a regular basis. Minor problems with
                                          printers must be corrected before
                                          unmanageable backlogs of print requests
                                          accumulate. These are maintenance
                                          requirements to be planned for.
                   High initial           A network can be expensive to install. The
                   installation cost      apparent high price of a LAN can be
                                          misleading, though, because the actual cost

                          TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Technology        Telecommunications is the process of transferring information
quick look        electronically over distance. The following information applies:

                     Telecommunications links computers to other computers
                     beyond the local area network, even nationwide and globally.
                     The electronic link is normally through telephone lines.
                     Sending and receiving computers require modems (internal or
                     external) and communications software.
                     Modems have transmission rates and work with software
                     protocols; the sending and receiving modems must be able to
                     synchronize.
                     Telecommunications has the ability to support and greatly
                     expand the offering of education and training to students not
                     present with the instructor.
                     Telecommunications is changing the way Americans live and
                     work and recreate.


Telecommuni-      These terms are commonly used when discussing
cations           telecommunication systems:
terminology
                     Modem is short for MOdulate / DEModulate. The devices
                     convert computer data into audible tones that can be sent
                     through telephone lines for another modem on the receiving
                     end to convert back to computer data.
                     Baud rate is the speed at which modems can send and
                     receive data.
                     Going online refers starting to the telecommunications
                     process.
                     Logging on is the initial connecting through modem and
                     phone lines to a distant computer. Logging off is the
                     disconnection.
                     Downloading is the process of bringing a file from the remote
                     computer to your computer. Uploading is the process of
                     sending a file to the remote computer.

                                Section A
                    The Telecommunication Technologies

The basics            The field of telecommunications builds on computer technology.
                      Simply stated, telecommunications is the outreach ability of
                      computer systems. Telecommunications is the linking of
                      computers remote from each other. As discussed in Chapter 8,
                      local area networks link computers that are in close proximity.


Additional            The technologies that provide the outreach capabilities include:
technologies
                         Modems
                         Software protocols
                         Facsimile transmission
                         Hybrid fax and modem systems


How modems work       The only equipment needed to connect a computer to a standard
                      telephone line is a modem. The term is derived from MOdulation
                      / DEModulation. The modem can be an internal card in the
                      computer or an external device cabled to the computer and the
                      phone line. A modem accomplishes two tasks, respectively
                      known as modulating and demodulating:

                         Modulating. Conversion of computer digital information into
                         an analog-based fluctuating tone capable of moving through
                         telephone lines.
                         Demodulation. Receiving the fluctuating tone inbound
                         through telephone lines and converting the tone into digital
                         computer data.


Computer long-        Telecommunications is long-distance calling for computer
distance calling      systems. The distance between sending and receiving
                      computers and their modems is inconsequential.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 4       1 November 2002                                     106




Variations in        Improvements in modem and telephone line technologies over
modem                the past decade led to significant increases in the speed of
transmission rates   modems. The faster the transmission rate, the shorter the long
                     distance time involved, and the lower the cost of
                     telecommunicating. Transmission rates were originally rated in
                     "baud," a complex measurement. The higher the baud rate, the
                     more data transmitted per second. The baud rating of modems
                     has been replaced by the "bits per second" measurement, or
                     "bps."


Bits per second      A bit is a binary digit, having a value of either 0 or 1. Computers
                     use bits to define and separate characters, about 10 bits for a
                     single character of information (including start and stop bits). A
                     modem with a transmission rate of 1200 bps will transmit about
                     120 characters per second. Transmission rates continue to
                     increase; 9600 bps modems are not unusual. (Example: this
                     block of information on bits per second is 479 characters/spaces
                     long. It could be transmitted by a 1200 bps modem in about 3.99
                     seconds.)


Software protocols   As two computer modems exchange information, the computers
                     "handshake" with each other to ensure that the information can
                     be translated successfully. This exchange of protocols includes
                     agreement that certain bits represent the start and end of
                     characters, that the number of bits in each character is
                     understood, that no errors have been introduced in the
                     transmission, and that the receiving modem and computer are
                     ready to receive the data. Most software programs and modems
                     accomplish the handshake automatically.


Facsimile            Facsimile machines, popularly called "faxes," are used to send
transmission         copies of paper documents from one location to another. The fax
technology           machine operates much like a modem, generating tones sent
                     over telephone lines. There is a major difference: fax tones do
                     not represent actual characters of information. They represent
                     only areas of light or dark on the original document. A graphic
                     copy of the original is reproduced on the receiving end, and
                     although it appears to be text, it is not. However, the receiver
                     cannot feed the information thereon directly into a computer.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 4      1 November 2002                                     107




Hybrid           Recent advances have created fax/modems that:
fax/modems
                    Can send data files to be received as an image on the distant
                    fax machine.

                    Can receive a fax image and, with proper software, store the
                    image, print it, or display it on the computer screen.
                    Cost little more than standard modems and, therefore, may be
                    good investments if fax capability is needed but fax machines
                    are not already available.


Fax/modem        The user must remember that fax images remain image data and
limitations      cannot be translated into text files by a computer. Text files can
                 be converted into images for sending to a fax machine, but when
                 received they are images and not text files.

                                 Section B
                        Telecommunications Applications

The impact of          Telecommunication technologies have impacted every American
telecommuni-           and most people of the world. The following are common
cations                examples of telecommunications technology applications.

                          Television broadcasts can be taped for convenient viewing.
                          Telephone messages no longer require direct contact with
                          callers; answering machines save communicated messages.
                          Research of information sources does not end when libraries
                          close or office staffs go home; electronic databases are
                          accessed all hours of the day.
                          Personal and business written messages can be delivered
                          electronically, never going through the postal system.


Advantages for         Although not developed specifically for education and training
education and          applications, telecommunications technologies have significant
training               benefits for educators and trainers. If considered as tools, these
                       technologies offer gains in productivity, effectiveness, and even
                       enjoyment to all levels of education training. One of the greatest
                       benefits is the ability for the computer-capable person to reach
                       out, capture and use an endless array of materials, information,
                       and professional contacts.


Telecommun-            The technologies have been shaped to develop and make
ication applications   available the following tools and systems:

                          Email
                          Bulletin boards
                          Remote computing with mainframes
                          Online services
AFH 36-2235       Volume 4       1 November 2002                                       109




E-mail               Electronic mail is familiar to most office workers as a
                     communication means to quickly exchange information with co-
                     workers on the local area network to which their computers are
                     linked. If the users think globally, e-mail systems can also be
                     linked through modems to any other computer, no matter its
                     location, if the receiver has a modem and is connected to the
                     telephone system. Messages, even lengthy files to be shared,
                     can be delivered almost immediately to one or several
                     individuals. Time, postage and telephone costs are minimized.


Bulletin boards      Similar to all bulletin boards, electronic bulletin boards offer many
                     of the same functions:

                        Extension of e-mail. Messages can be posted for pick-up by
                        any interested reader with access to the board.
                        Conferencing. Most bulletin board services have people
                        designate conferences, or areas of interest, for which they
                        want to receive information.
                        File transfers. Files can be uploaded to the bulletin board for
                        downloading by board users. This can be a most effective
                        distribution system. One caution: copyright considerations
                        must be strictly followed. Uploading and downloading
                        copyrighted files to a bulletin board can constitute pirating,
                        theft of the property. Bulletin board users must also guard
                        against the possibility of downloading viruses with files
                        brought into their computers.
                        Database access. Many bulletin boards allow users to access
                        specific databases. Examples include course offerings, library
                        holdings, and public records. The bulletin board will activate
                        the appropriate software when requested.
                        Doors. This term refers to an access path by which users can
                        run software other than the actual bulletin board. This allows
                        running the software and seeing the results before deciding to
                        go through the download process.

Remote computing     Personal computers and modems have completely changed the
with mainframes      way many people use mainframe computers. Terminal emulation
                     software has been developed to link personal computers to
                     mainframe computers. With the use of modems, the personal
                     computer can be remote from the mainframe computer. This
                     allows personal computer users to access the greater computing
                     power and stored data of the mainframe. It also allows
                     companies to consider having their employees work where
                     convenient, even at home, and to access the company
                     mainframe for downloading and uploading their work elements.
                     Similarly, researchers from their personal computers can
                     continue to use the search capabilities and databases of
                     mainframe facilities around the clock.


Online services      Some companies are in the business of providing online service
                     to individual subscribers. Subscribers use their personal
                     computers and modems at home, office or school to connect to
                     the company's mainframe computer. There are two categories of
                     services:

                        Database online services. These vendors create a front end
                        means of access to a variety of commercial indexes,
                        bibliographies, or other databases. Consumers use the
                        company's user-friendly search interface to get the needed
                        information. The charges for the service go up to $300 an
                        hour. DIALOG is perhaps the best known of the database
                        online service vendors.
                        Integrated online services. These vendors offer, usually
                        through monthly fee arrangements, a multitude of consumer-
                        oriented services. Personal computer users can access
                        current news, E-mail, airline reservations, information
                        databases, stock market quotes, and many other services.
                        Some features have additional charges for timed use. Prodigy
                        and CompuServe are probably the best-known integrated
                        online service vendors.

                                 Section C
                   Teleconferencing and Distance Learning

Teleconferencing      Teleconferencing techniques are essential components for some
and distance          forms of distance education. Three categories of
learning              teleconferencing technologies are:

                         Audio teleconferencing
                         Audiographic teleconferencing
                         Videoconferencing


Audio                 This technology uses standard telephones for audio conferences.
teleconferencing      Minimal equipment is required. However, the lack of visual
                      interaction can limit a learner engagement. Audio
                      teleconferencing requires advance planning and the preparation
                      of additional materials.


Audiographic          This technology adds the element of two-way image transmission
teleconferencing      to audio teleconferencing. This variation allows charts, figures,
                      and still pictures to be exchanged during the conference. The
                      interactive exchange of images, along with audio, can encourage
                      the free expression of ideas during the educational process. This
                      can be done at a reasonable cost.


Video conferencing    This technology combines full-motion video with audio. It is
                      useful in situations that require the use of motion to enhance the
                      course content. Most forms of videoconferencing still require
                      careful cost justification in educational settings. Recently
                      developed digital techniques can offer a variety of cost-effective
                      applications.

                                  Section D
                   Review of Teleconferencing Technologies

Status of             Teleconferencing is the use of telecommunications technology to
teleconferencing      link two or more sites for interactive passing of information.
                      Teleconferencing is growing as a support service for the
                      distribution of learning programs. Capabilities available today are
                      generally in three categories:

                         Audio teleconferencing. The maturest of the techniques,
                         audio teleconferencing requires little equipment. Its major
                         drawback is that the lack of visual interaction requires
                         planning to keep the educational process productive.
                         Audiographic teleconferencing. This variation allows figures,
                         charts, and still pictures to be exchanged during the
                         conference. Computer and fax technologies are used for
                         interactive exchange of images, thus enhancing the free
                         expression of ideas.
                         Video teleconferencing. This technique combines full-motion
                         video with audio. Most forms of video teleconferencing still
                         require careful cost justification in education uses, but costs
                         are declining.


Comparison of         Teleconferencing has progressed to the point that it can be an
teleconferencing      effective addition to education and training, especially when
techniques            instructors are fewer in number and students are dispersed
                      worldwide. The following table summarizes the features of
                      teleconferencing techniques.

Representative        About 100 corporations in the United States have invested in
costs                 corporate video teleconferencing for frequent use. The requisite
                      equipment can fit on a cart that can be rolled from classroom to
                      classroom or between offices. Included are a video camera,
                      monitor, video compression-decompression system, and an
                      interface for connecting to a telephone line. Cost as of late 1993:
                      $50,000 to $70,000. Anticipated 1994 cost: $20,000 to $30,000.

                      Prices for "switched telecomm" services over a dial-up network,
                      digital video-capable personal computers, is forecast as $15 to
                      $20 for an hour of coast-to-coast time in 1995. The two PCs will
                      cost under $10,000 (Haber, 1992).

Educational       Education and training managers, developers, and instructors
applications      have successfully applied teleconferencing to needs that justified
                  the time and cost requirements. As these costs continue to
                  decline, additional use of teleconferencing will be seen for these
                  applications:

                      Guest speakers. Adding subject matter experts to class
                      discussions, without requiring the expert to travel to the
                      school.
                      Homebound or remotely based students. This connects the
                      classroom and students unable to attend classes.
                      Distance tutoring. This connects tutors and students who
                      need additional assistance, even if after class times.
                      Distributed classrooms. Connecting several classroom sites
                      to a location where the teacher is available is often a cost-
                      effective delivery means. Teleconferencing takes place at a
                      prearranged time for interaction between instructor and
                      students.
                      Distributed classes. Often used for adult students who
                      cannot be gathered for same-time classes. Individual
                      students or groups of students at a site gather to work with
                      taped programs.
                      Contract courses. Specialized courses or those with a
                      scarcity of teachers are often provided through contracting
                      with outside companies. These courses are often delivered
                      via satellite television with audio teleconferencing for student
                      interaction.

                                  THE INTERNET

The internet         The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks. It
                     consists of thousands of separately administered networks. Each
                     network is comprised of many computers. The total number of
                     individual users of the Internet is in the millions. The Internet
                     promotes communication, collaboration, resource sharing, and
                     information access.


Physical             For the Internet to exist, there must be connections between
connections and      computers and agreements on how they are to communicate.
logical agreements   Connections consist of a variety of communication media or
                     methods (e.g., metal wires, microwave links, packet radio, or fiber
                     optic cables). These connections are established within areas or
                     regions by a networking organization. They have authority or
                     economic interest in that area. For example, a university
                     academic department may use Ethernet cables to connect its
                     personal computers and workstations into a local area network
                     (LAN). They are connected to the cables that the university uses
                     to join the buildings. These cables are linked to cables in a
                     regional network. The path between any two points on the
                     Internet traverses physical connections that are administered by
                     a variety of independent authorities.

                     For different computers (e.g., personal computers, mainframes)
                     to communicate over a network, there must be agreements on
                     how this will occur. These agreements are called communication
                     protocols. On the Internet, the Transmission Control Protocol /
                     Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols defines
                     communication at a machine-to-machine level. Application
                     software for accomplishing specific tasks must adhere to these
                     standards and take advantage of the connectivity they provide.
                     Examples are:

                        Electronic Mail
                        Newsgroups
                        The World Wide Web
                        Telnet
                        File Transfer

Electronic mail      Electronic mail, or e-mail, is a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to
                     communicate with other Internet users around the world. It is
                     possible for Internet users to exchange e-mail with users of other
                     networks through America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, and
                     others. Internet users find that the expanded capability to
                     communicate with colleagues around the world leads to important
                     new sources of information, collaboration, and professional
                     development.


Newsgroups           Besides basic correspondence between two network users, e-
                     mail presents additional opportunities for communication.
                     Through various methods of distributing e-mail messages to lists
                     of subscribers, e-mail supports electronic discussions on a wide
                     range of topics.

                     These discussions bring together like-minded individuals who use
                     the forums for discussing common problems, sharing solutions,
                     and examining issues.


The World Wide       The most widespread applications on the web, besides electronic
Web (WWW)            mail, are the World Wide Web. Using the Web application
                     program (called a browser or client), Internet users can find
                     information on numerous topics that are supplied by different
                     Internet servers around the world. Information on the Web is
                     presented to the user as linked documents that consist of text,
                     images, and links to other computer files. Online subject
                     directories and searchable databases of Web resources provide
                     basic methods for locating information. The future of the Web will
                     likely include sophisticated ways of interacting with online
                     information. This includes virtual reality, video conferencing, and
                     other kinds of online interactivity and collaboration.


Telnet               Telnet allows an Internet user in one location to establish an
                     online connection with a remote computer located elsewhere.
                     Once a connection is established with a remote computer, users
                     can use that remote system if their computers are set up as hard-
                     wired terminals of that remote system. Using Telnet, an Internet
                     user can establish connections with a multitude of:

                                                                    Continued on next page

Telnet                   Bibliographic databases (e.g., primarily library catalogs, full-
(Continued)              text
                         databases)
                         Data files (e.g., statistics, oceanographic data, meteorological
                         data, geographic data, etc.), and
                         Other online services.

                      Many of these systems are available for any Internet user to
                      access and use without an account.


File Transfer (FTP)   Another application of the Internet is the ability to transfer files
                      from one Internet-connected computer to another. This function is
                      provided by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) of the TCP/IP
                      protocol suite. In a method similar to using Telnet, network users
                      initiate an online connection with another Internet computer
                      through FTP. Unlike Telnet, this online connection can perform
                      only to functions related to locating and transferring files. This
                      includes the ability to change directories, list files, retrieve files,
                      etc. Any World Wide Web user can download files using FTP.
                      The user generally cannot upload files.

                      The types of files that can be transferred through FTP include
                      files that can be stored on a computer such as:

                         Text files
                         Software programs
                         Graphic images
                         Sounds
                         Files formatted for particular software programs (e.g., files with
                         word processing formatting instructions), and
                         Others

                      Many computer administrators set aside portions of their
                      machines to offer files for anyone on the Internet to retrieve.
                      These archive sites support anonymous logins that do not require
                      an account to access. These are called anonymous FTP sites.

A premier           What makes the Internet remarkable is the ease and speed of
communications      access to information that not dependent on proximity. Internet
ability             users can connect to systems on the other side of the globe as
                    easily as they can connect to systems nearby. Since most
                    Internet users are now charged a flat rate for access to the
                    Internet, cost is not a significant inhibitor of usage. The barriers of
                    distance, time, and cost are often less significant or non-existent
                    on the Internet.


Getting connected   There are several ways to gain access to the Internet. Users may
                    access through a modem, an Internet Service Provider (ISP), or
                    through a network card. Due to the low cost for Internet access,
                    the availability of inexpensive modems, and free or inexpensive
                    Internet software, most computer users can now afford to access
                    the Internet.

Future possibilities   The Internet evolved through formal standards development and
                       individual and corporate software creation/enhancement. What
                       began as an U.S. government-subsidized network to allow
                       scholars and researchers to share supercomputer resources, it
                       has become a mainstream network of commercial companies,
                       individuals, and organizations.

                       The Internet continues to be a resource for providing web-based
                       learning. The DoD vision is to provide learning anytime,
                       anywhere with the potential of sharable and reusable courseware
                       objects. The DoD student of the future will have greater
                       capability to tailor his/her own learning experiences through menu
                       driven instructional options. These will become more readily
                       available through electronically flexible, digital information
                       networking systems. The current DoD advanced distributed
                       learning (ADL) initiative moves the military services toward non-
                       resident web-based instructional delivery, which is more
                       consistent with a integrated, mobile fighting force.

                       Commercial use of the Internet has spurred rapid development of
                       new software. This trend is continuing. Some of the
                       developments that will help make the Internet a full-featured
                       information appliance are:

                              Virtual reality
                              Full-motion, real-time
                              High quality audio and video, and
                              Advanced scripting and programming capabilities
