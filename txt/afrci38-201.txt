                    MANPOWER AUTHORIZATIONS AND ALLOCATIONS

1.1. Responsibilities. The Division Chief of Manpower and Organization is responsible for the valida-
tion, distribution, and effective utilization of the manpower resources allocated to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC). The allocation of these resources to AFRC units is the culmination of the Depart-
ment of Defenseâ€™s planning, programming, and budgeting system (PPBS) as prescribed in AFPD 38-2,
Manpower.

1.2. Manpower Resource Allocation. The Directorate of Programs and Evaluation, HQ USAF/PE,
issues a manpower allocation to all major commands based on the manpower resources reflected in each
fiscal year of the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). HQ AFRC/XPM allocates the resources by pro-
gram element code to unit/location.
    1.2.1. Active duty military, civilian (air reserve technician (ART) and nonART), and reserve authori-
    zations reflect approved FYDP funding. The funding is based on program objective memorandum
    (POM) submissions, approved Air Force budget submissions, and congressional appropriations. HQ
    AFRC/XPM maintains the Manpower Data System (MDS) and validates manpower requirements
    based on command priorities. Validated requirements in excess of funding levels are placed on the
    UMDs as unfunded requirements. These unfunded requirements are filled with overhires when dol-
    lars are available. Unit commanders establish the priority system for filling unfunded requirements
    with overhires.
    1.2.2. HQ AFRC allocates all of the manpower resources made available to the command through the
    PPBS process when available resources equal or exceed manpower requirements. An exception is
    made when it becomes evident that authorizations will be withdrawn from the command or it is nec-
    essary to redirect resources to accomplish higher priority missions. In such circumstances, the Divi-
    sion Chief of Manpower and Organization, in coordination with the AFRC Vice Commander and
    staff, may implement a hiring restriction. Although this restriction may be effected through military
    or civilian personnel channels, it may take the form of adjustments to the UMD-Active, Reserve, and
    Individual Reserve Augmentee (IMA). Restricted positions may be identified either by Air Force spe-
    cialty or Air Force remarks codes. These codes are used to instruct local personnel officers to audit,
    delete, or convert vacant positions. The servicing personnel officer reports the status of restricted
    positions to HQ AFRC/XPMR quarterly. Status is either vacant or encumbered. Vacant positions will
    not be filled; occupants of encumbered positions are advised that their positions will be withdrawn at
    a future date.

                          MANPOWER RESOURCES AND DOCUMENTS

2.1. Unit Manpower Document (UMD). Manpower authorizations are allocated to units on three basic
parts of the UMD: Active, Reserve, and IMA.
   2.1.1. The Active UMD contains active duty military, civilian, and reservists ordered to active duty
   under Air Guard Reserve (AGR) authorization. Active authorizations provide the peacetime support
   required for the management of the Air Force Reserve.
       2.1.1.1. There are two basic types of civilian authorizations.
           2.1.1.1.1. ART authorizations provide peacetime management and support and satisfy a war-
           time requirement in the reserve unit. ARTs are assigned to a specific reserve unit. On the
           UMD, these authorizations are differentiated from nonART civilian authorizations by a "Y" in
           the ART column, a duty code, an ART grade, and position description number in the command
           remarks (CRK) column.
           2.1.1.1.2. NonART authorizations provide peacetime support to units.
       2.1.1.2. AGR authorizations are established to account for reservists selected to serve on
       extended active duty for a specified time, usually over 360 days.
   2.1.2. The Reserve UMD contains the reserve authorizations.
       2.1.2.1. Unit reserve authorizations are military positions which have been established by the
       gaining command to accomplish the wartime mission or by HQ AFRC to satisfy peacetime man-
       agement requirements. Units with the same mission or primary aircraft authorizations will nor-
       mally have similar UMDs.
       2.1.2.2. If a reserve authorization is also an ART, the ART column is coded with a "Y" on the
       Active UMD and the corresponding Reserve UMD authorization. All other reserve authoriza-
       tions are referred to as nonART reserve positions and are coded "N" in the ART column.
   2.1.3. The IMA UMD contains IMA authorizations. IMAs are selected military reserve positions
   assigned to active units. They are approved in skills having wartime shortfalls and support the unit
   mission during the period immediately following a declaration of war or national emergency.

2.2. Deputy/Assistant Position. Deputy or full-time assistant positions occur when two positions jointly
manage, direct, and supervise the administrative and technical aspects of operations in the same organiza-
tion. While only the chief position has final accountability, the two positions share management respon-
sibility and authority for accomplishment of the mission and functions of the organization. A deputy or
full-time assistant should not be confused with positions which would normally be found in the direct
supervisory line. Division chiefs, branch chiefs, and other supervisors may perform assistant duties con-
currently with primary assigned duties and may be designated to act in the absence of the chief. Duties
associated with this type of less than full-time assistant responsibilities will normally be described in the
position description.

2.3. Hiring Authority. The UMD and AFRC Form 261, Unfunded Requirement and Overhire Authori-
zation Advisory (see Attachment 2), are the only authoritative statements of hiring authority in AFRC.
4                                                                           AFRCI38-201 23 June 2000

2.4. Unfunded Requirements. Unfunded requirements are validated UMD requirements which have not
been funded by Congress or HQ USAF. Unfunded requirements are shown on the UMD with a code "N"
in the funded column (with the exception of Type D overhires).

2.5. Overhires. Overhires are increases above current full-time funded UMD authorizations. Funded
UMD positions may not provide sufficient flexibility to meet shifting, peak, seasonal, or cyclical work
load demands. This may be particularly true in units which have a significant number of unfunded
requirements. Overhire authorizations are designed to fill this void. There are four types of overhires and
one type of temporary additive. HQ AFRC/XPM approves Types A, B, C, and F overhires. The NAF/
XPM normally approves the Type D and provides an information copy to HQ AFRC/XPM. All overhire
requests are approved on an AFRC Form 261 which is prepared by the approving authority. The overhire
is identified on the UMD by the overhire code A, B, C, or F in the first or seventh column of the CRK
code field. Hiring is subject to the availability of unit funds.
    2.5.1. Establish the Type A overhire when an increased requirement of a continuous nature has been
    validated and resources are not available to fund the authorization. The justification may originate in
    several ways: (1) The unit may submit an AFRC Form 106, Manpower Change Request; (2) HQ
    AFRC/XPM may apply the manpower standard; or (3) AFRC/CV may direct the action.
    2.5.2. Establish the Type B overhire to satisfy a special or unique need recognized by HQ AFRC.
    The primary purpose of this type overhire is to provide an interim solution to a personnel or manage-
    ment problem. The Type B overhire is effective for 3 or more months depending on the requirement.
    2.5.3. Establish the Type C overhire to satisfy a well-defined work load of noncontinuous, temporary,
    or transient nature. This overhire authority never exceeds 4 quarters.
    2.5.4. Establish the Type D temporary additive to hire a second employee against an established
    UMD authorization. The existing incumbent may have vacated the job for an extended period for
    training, temporary duty, leave without pay, sick leave, or pending disability retirement. Type D addi-
    tives are usually short-term and are not normally identified on the UMD.
    2.5.5. Establish the Type F overhire to permit early hire against funded authorizations, such as unit
    resources allocated for conversions and out-year program objective memorandum (POM) approved/
    funded UMD authorizations. Often these are bookkeeping transactions used to accommodate person-
    nel actions during unit conversions.

2.6. Part-Time. There are occasions when work load may be more than current authorizations can sup-
port, but not enough to justify an additional full-time position. Part-time positions should not be confused
with or used in lieu of overhire or temporary hire authorizations. When funds are not otherwise available,
part-time authorizations may be established as Type A overhires to handle permanent work load and
should not exceed 20 hours per week. Submit requests for part-time positions on AFRC Form 106. Iden-
tify part-time authorizations on the UMD by "PTIME" in the CRK column preceded by an Authorization
Change Notice (ACN) number. For each part-time position, the amount (AMT) column of the UMD will
reflect a whole number. However, each part-time position represents one-half of a full-time position;
therefore, two part-time positions equal one full-time position.

2.7. Manpower Documents. The UMD is a computer-generated product of the Manpower Data System
(MDS). Units receive UMDs from their servicing military personnel office (MPF) via the MDS. As a
minimum, units should establish a requirement to receive an updated UMD quarterly.
AFRCI38-201 23 June 2000                                                                            5

2.8. Manpower Standards. One of the primary means of determining Part A manpower requirements is
through the application of AFRC manpower standards. The schedule for annual application is provided at
attachment 4. When required, HQ AFRC/XPMR will request work load data from the functional manager
to facilitate the application of the standard. See attachment 5.

                                                 Chapter 3

                             MANPOWER CHANGE REQUESTS (MCR)

3.1. General Information. Submit an MCR when a change is required on Parts A, B, or C of the unit
manpower document (UMD).
    3.1.1. Even though MCRs are normally submitted by units, numbered air forces (NAF) and HQ
    AFRC staff elements may submit MCRs on the unitsâ€™ behalf. Submit MCRs pertaining to the NAF or
    a reserve unit to HQ AFRC/XPMR in two copies (three if submitted through NAF). Call your NAF
    manpower representative if you need clarification on procedures.
    3.1.2. Submit MCRs for the HQ AFRC staff and direct reporting units on AFRC Form 106 or in
    memorandum format to HQ AFRC/XPMX. The staff division chief/special staff chief can submit the
    change. Change requests involving two or more divisions are submitted by the director.
    3.1.3. Locally "assumed" missions or "desired" capabilities are not reasons to request a UMD change.

3.2. Zero Balance MCRs:
    3.2.1. Each request for an increase in UMD authorizations should be accompanied by a proposal for
    an equivalent offsetting decrease. Zero balance changes should result in no cost to the command.
    Failure to identify compensatory authorizations may delay processing or result in disapproval.
    NOTE: Exceptions are limited to externally imposed requirements such as changes to Air Force/
    AFRC directives, weapon systems, and programmed flying hours.
    3.2.2. Wing commanders have the authority to approve an AFRC Form 106 if it meets the criteria
    outlined in the decision/logic table matrix (attachment 6) and does not result in an increase in the total
    number of UMD authorizations, grades, or other costs to the command.

3.3. MCRs in Cost Compared Areas:
    3.3.1. Functional areas operating under a most efficient organization (MEO) based on an Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 cost comparison are not prohibited from changes. To
    ensure all levels of review for MCRs in functions involved in, or the result of, an A-76 Cost Compar-
    ison, the following statement must be included on the AFRC Form 106: "I certify that the manpower
    change outlined in this request will not cause this unit to exceed the government cost estimate as out-
    lined in OMB Circular A-76."
    3.3.2. AFRC Form 106 is not required for changes in base operating support functions subject to per-
    formance work statement (PWS) revisions. HQ AFRC/XPMT evaluates published PWS revisions to
    determine manpower impact and notify the functional office of primary responsibility (OPR) of the
    results. UMDs are adjusted as required.

3.4. Preparation of AFRC Form 106. Refer to the appropriate data element (see attachment 3) of the
most current copy of the UMD when completing AFRC Form 106. (See attachment 1 for sample.) Com-
mon acronyms used to review an UMD or prepare a MCR are provided in attachment 8.
    3.4.1. OVERHIRE REQUEST TYPE. Mark the type overhire requested (A, B, C, D, or F).
AFRCI38-201 23 June 2000                                                                                  7

   3.4.2. CONTROL NUMBER (UNIT-NR-CY). This block is reserved for use by the wing, NAF, and
   AFRC direct reporting units. The manpower representative in these units enters a unit control number
   on the form (see table 3.1). The first group of digits is the numerical designation of the unit. The next
   two digits are a consecutive number beginning with "01." The final two digits indicate the calendar
   year (CY). (The manpower representative may find it practical to establish a log to keep track of the
   control number.) Example control numbers:

Table 3.1. Control Numbers.
                      Unit             Consecutive Number                   CY

       3.4.8.15. REMARKS (Column P). Enter remarks.
    3.4.9. JUSTIFICATION. In general, all justification for MCRs falls into one or more of the following
    categories: new or added work load, increased or decreased work loads within existing responsibili-
    ties, decreased responsibilities and associated work loads, and correction requests. The appropriate
    reasons will head the justification in capital letters. Reasons other than these are judged on their own
    merit, but should include at least as much detail in their preparation as is required below:
       3.4.9.1. NEW RESPONSIBILITIES. Cite the authority (publication or message) for the new
       responsibilities. Describe the associated new work in terms of new products or services produced,
       how they are produced (including equipment used if appropriate), and how they differ from exist-
       ing products or services. Include a detailed explanation of how the amount of manpower being
       requested was computed. Always relate the justification to quantitative work load data, trends,
       overtime expended, number of days over and above normal training days used, quantifiable back-
       log--past versus present, and work load projections, rather than describing the perceived require-
       ments in general terms. Use the work load factor defined in the manpower standard if applicable.
       Identify manpower authorizations in other related workcenters which may be used as trade-offs to
       satisfy the new work load requirement, and describe the impact on these workcenters in terms of
       reduced or discontinued services and products.
       3.4.9.2. INCREASED OR DECREASED WORK LOAD. Cite the reasons for increase or
       decrease; that is, what long-term trends, managerial policies, equipment characteristics, etc.,
       caused increases or decreases in expended or projected manpower requirements. Relate the rea-
       sons for the increases or decreases to documented facts, for example, overtime expenditures, back-
       logged man-hours, changes in population serviced, number of position vacancies over the last 6
       months, number of positions filled by new employees within the last 6 months, quality of the prod-
       ucts or service, recognized studies projecting future work load, responsibilities which cannot be
       accomplished through acceptable management procedures, etc., and show the computations. In
       the case of increases, list the specific management actions which have been taken before the
       request to absorb the work load. Identify streamlined procedures and operating policies, resched-
       uled work, revised priorities, improved controls over work, etc. Always relate the justification to
       the work load factors defined in the manpower standard if applicable. Identify tradeoff authoriza-
       tions and impacts in "new responsibility."
       3.4.9.3. DECREASED RESPONSIBILITIES. Cite the authority for the decreased responsibili-
       ties and describe the associated work in terms of products or services no longer required. Include
       a detailed explanation of how the amount of manpower being returned to AFRC was computed.
       Always relate the justification to the work load factor defined in the manpower standard if appli-
       cable.
       3.4.9.4. CORRECTION REQUEST. In the event that erroneous data is on the UMD, cite the data
       element in error, its controlling reference document or agency, and any coordination accomplished
AFRCI38-201 23 June 2000                                                                                   9

       to verify the error. Attachment 3 is provided to aid the requester in determining the appropriate
       OPR for various data elements.
   3.4.10. SIGNATURE OF COMMANDER. Enter typed name and grade of the signing official. If the
   wing commander signs the request, it is not necessary for the wing commander to sign the coordina-
   tion block on the reverse side of the form.
       3.4.10.1. MCRs originating at wing level or below must be signed by either the wing commander
       or senior ART if the wing commander is nonART.
       3.4.10.2. MCRs originating at geographically separated units must be signed by either the unit
       commander or senior ART if the unit commander is nonART.
       3.4.10.3. MCRs originating at geographically separated flying squadrons, for example, air rescue
       squadrons, must be signed by the squadron commander or the senior ART if the squadron com-
       mander is nonART.
       3.4.10.4. MCRs for separate units reporting to NAFs or AFRC, for example, regional support
       groups, must be signed by the separate unit commander.
   3.4.11. DATE. Enter date commander signs request.
   3.4.12. CN/PROJECT ID, SIGNATURE OF HQ AFRC MANPOWER TECHNICIAN, AND UMD
   UPDATED. These blocks will be completed by HQ AFRC at time of approval. These forms will not
   be returned to the NAF or units unless the request is disapproved. If the request is approved, the
   project identifier for the approval project will contain the MCR control number. The four digit control
   number on the project is the indicator that the MCR has been approved.

3.5. Processing AFRC Form 106. The reverse side of AFRC Form 106 (see Attachment 1) is designed to
serve as record of staffing and serves as the initial step in processing a request. Processing actions are
applicable for all AFRC units assigned to NAFs.
   3.5.1. COORDINATION, RECOMMENDATION, APPROVAL/DISAPPROVAL RATIONALE:
       3.5.1.1. Coordination Official. In the coordination/recommendation block, provide the office
       symbol and name of coordination official. The coordination official signs the form, dates it, and
       identifies a recommendation by checking the appropriate block. NOTE: If additional comments
       are required for submission to the wing commander, include these as an attachment to AFRC
       Form 106 and print the attachment number in the appropriate recommendation block. State the
       reasons for the recommendation and indicate the alternative actions that have been considered.
       Describe the adverse impact that failure to provide the requested action would have on unit mis-
       sion effectiveness.
       3.5.1.2. Originating Unit. At the initiating location, minimum coordination should include the
       requester as indicated on the front side of the form, the requesterâ€™s supervisor (if not the wing com-
       mander), and the designated manpower representative.
       3.5.1.3. Wing Functional Manager. Reviews the request, the problem, and alternative solutions
       offered to ensure that the best solution does, in fact, require a manpower change. Do not use
       MCRs to resolve problems that can be resolved by personnel or management actions at the func-
       tional manager level.
       3.5.1.4. Wing Manpower Representative:
10                                                                        AFRCI38-201 23 June 2000

           3.5.1.4.1. Maintains and monitors ACNs and UMDs for units serviced. This includes posting
           ACNs to current UMDs and briefing commanders and staff on impact of significant changes.
           3.5.1.4.2. Evaluates proposed manpower changes and reports impact as appropriate.
           3.5.1.4.3. Advises unit commander and functional staff on manpower authorization change
           notices and other significant manpower matters.
        3.5.1.5. Wing Commander. May recommend approval of the MCR and forward it to the NAF/
        XPM manpower office. The wing commander also has the authority and responsibility to disap-
        prove MCRs. MCRs returned to the unit disapproved should have the "Approval/Disapproval
        Rationale" section of the AFRC Form 106 completed and signed by the wing commander.
        3.5.1.6. NAF/XPM:
           3.5.1.6.1. Analyzes and evaluates the request and its supporting data. Places emphasis on the
           overall cost effectiveness of the proposed actions within established resource limitations, for
           example, manpower ceilings, man-year restrictions, grade ceilings, etc.
           3.5.1.6.2. Obtains NAF OPR review and comments. Determines if the request is unique to
           the requesting unit or whether it should be applicable to all like units.
           3.5.1.6.3. Finalizes the NAF position and briefs the NAF commander when appropriate. NAF
           commanders have the authority and responsibility to disapprove MCRs that do not meet the
           standards of good management practices or are not in compliance with established manpower
           and personnel procedures. Enter disapproval rationale in the "Approval/Disapproval Ratio-
           nale" block, and return the request to the requesting unit.

           proposals against the reported and projected workloads.
           3.5.2.1.3. Forwards MCR to the appropriate functional manager, if the MCR is not a zero bal-
           ance action, with an analysis and recommendation for approval/disapproval.
           3.5.2.1.4. HQ AFRC/XPMR forwards MCR that results in an organizational change to HQ
           AFRC/XPMX for validation or disapproval.
           3.5.2.1.5. Processes valid zero balance actions and provides an information copy to the func-
           tional manager.
