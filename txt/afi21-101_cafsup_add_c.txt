This addendum implements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
This supplement prescribes policies and procedures governing aerospace equipment maintenance
management of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) aircraft for Air Combat Command (ACC),
Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). The Air
National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) can adopt this addendum, as
required, to supplement their MAJCOM supplement to AFI 21-101; however, ANG/AFRC
personnel assigned to Classic Associate Units supporting CAF units will comply with the
guidance provided within this addendum. Maintenance units will use this addendum in
conjunction with the CAF supplement to AFI 21-101; if a conflict exists between the CAF
supplement and this addendum the addendum will take precedence. This publication may be
supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this
publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. Requests for waivers must be
submitted through chain of command to the OPR listed above for consideration and approval.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS). Contact supporting records managers as required. Send

                     MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Common Terminology. For the purpose of this publication the following terms will be
used.
   1.1.1. Ground Control Station (GCS) will be used when referring to Mission Control
   Element (MCE), Launch Recovery Element (LRE), or any separated ground element that
   controls a RPA as applicable.
   1.1.2. Communication link (Comm Link) refers to any communication equipment used to
   establish a link between the RPA and GCS (e.g., SATCOM terminal, tactical antenna, etc).
   1.1.3. Remotely Piloted system (RPS): Refers to the RPA, GCS, and Comm link utilized
   together for operational purposes.
   1.1.4. Remote Split Operation (RSO): RSO refers to a concept of operational employment
   whereby the launch/recovery GCS and crew are geographically separated from the mission
   GCS and crew.
   1.1.5. For a more thorough discussion of concepts, refer to AFTTP 3-3, Aircraft
   Maintenance.
1.2. Maintenance Concept. The RPS will not receive a status as a complete unit. Each
RPA/GCS will receive a status as "A" type equipment per AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory,
Status and Utilization Reporting. The communication link will receive a status as "C" or "R"
type equipment per AFI 21-103.
1.3. Maintenance Resource Management (MRM). All military personnel with a
maintenance/munitions AFSC (including 3DXXX working in an aircraft maintenance related
field) assigned to a maintenance duty position are required to receive MRM training.
Government civilians working in maintenance/munitions are required to have MRM training.
Civilian contractors should be offered the opportunity to receive MRM training, but it is not
mandatory. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.16.2)
