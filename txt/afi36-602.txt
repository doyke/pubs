2.17. Position Descriptions. Position descriptions include KSAs required for successful progression to
the target position.

2.18. Preparing T&D Plans. PALACE Teams develop standardized T&D plans for occupational series
and grade levels. T&D plans serve as primary documents for developmental activities.
   2.18.1. Supervisors may supplement T&D plans (with approval by PALACE Teams) to provide for
   specific MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU and local base needs.
   2.18.2. T&D plans include:

2.19. Conducting Orientation.
   2.19.1. PAQ Interns or Fellows. Each PALACE Team develops, funds, and presents new PAQ
   interns and fellows with an orientation. The orientation covers:
       • Program purpose.
       • The Air Force mission and major programs.
       • Related administrative program requirements and procedures.


                                               12
   2.19.2. Supervisors of Record. Newly appointed PAQ supervisors participate in supervisor orienta-
   tions, which PALACE Teams may conduct with PAQ intern or fellow orientations. The supervisors’
   orientations address:
       • Training requests and evaluations.
       • Counseling and performance evaluations.
       • Promotion procedures.
   2.19.3. Rotational Assignment Supervisor. The supervisor of record provides each rotational
   assignment supervisor with:
       • A general overview of the PAQ Program.
       • The purpose of the rotational assignment.
       • Expectations for the PAQ intern or fellow.
       • Evaluation responsibilities.

2.20. Conducting Training.
   2.20.1. Funding. USAF formal schools (HQ, Air Education and Training Command [AETC], Air
   University [AU], Air Force Institute of Technology [AFIT]), and AFCPMC PALACE Teams fund
   travel and per diem for Air Force-sponsored courses when they are part of the approved T&D plan.
      2.20.1.1. PALACE Teams fund other training that USAF formal schools do not sponsor but form
      part of the T&D plan.
      2.20.1.2. The organization in which the PAQ intern or fellow receives training may also fund
      training that the T&D plan doesn't require.
      2.20.1.3. For USAF formal schools, PALACE Teams prepare a RIP, Allocation of Training
      Quota (QUOTA1), which notifies the PAQ intern's or fellow's servicing CPF of the scheduled
      training and the appropriate fund citation.
      2.20.1.4. The PALACE Team provides the fund citation by message for AFCPMC-funded train-
      ing.
   2.20.2. Requirements. During the annual training survey, PALACE Teams:
       • Identify requirements in the Training Management System (TMS) by using the Training
           Request Quota Indicator (TRQI) at AFCPMC.
       • Request waivers as necessary.
       • Schedule AFCPMC-funded courses that the TMS does not cover, if the courses are part of the
           T&D plan.
   2.20.3. Quotas. As PALACE Teams receive quotas, they allocate them through the TMS by the
   Name-Sub-Allocation process and provide information and fund citations by message to the servicing
   CPF training office when needed.
      2.20.3.1. The servicing CPF training office obtains and processes DD Form 1556, Request,
      Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and Reimbursement, when PALACE
      Teams allocate the quotas.


                                             13
   2.20.4. Extension Course Institute (ECI) and Correspondence Courses. The supervisor and ser-
   vicing CPF follow local procedures in obtaining these courses, which the PALACE Team funds.

2.21. Managing Overtime.
   2.21.1. Supervisors approve on-site overtime only in unusual situations and after they have exhausted
   other alternatives to complete the work.
   2.21.2. The supervisor requests agreement from the PALACE Team by telephone in advance for the
   overtime work.
       2.21.2.1. If the PALACE Team approves, the supervisor submits:
           • A request for overtime in accordance with local CPF procedures.
           • AF Form 896, Personnel Loaned or Borrowed by Cost Center, in order to charge the
              overtime to the appropriate local organization cost center.
       2.21.2.2. The CPF sends a copy of the approved request to the PALACE Team.
   2.21.3. AFCPMC does not fund on-site overtime.
   2.21.4. AFCPMC funds TDY overtime for PAQ interns who must travel during non-duty hours to
   attend training or if overtime is required for training while at the TDY location.
       2.21.4.1. The PAQ intern's supervisor submits a request for such overtime in advance on AF
       Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, through
       normal servicing CPF channels for approval by the PALACE Team.
       2.21.4.2. The PALACE Team reports the actual overtime hours that interns have worked to
       AFCPMC/DPOR within 2 weeks following completion of the TDY.

2.22. Setting Pay. PAQ interns and fellows entering the Federal service for the first time start in step 1 of
a grade level under the appropriate pay scale for that position.
   2.22.1. For current Federal employees or those with prior Federal service, CPFs determine the pay
   rate in accordance with local pay policy and highest-previous-rate rules.
   2.22.2. Pay retention applies if a selectee's current pay exceeds step 10 of a grade, and no break in ser-
   vice has occurred.

2.23. Performance Management. The Air Force Performance Management Program covers PAQ
interns and fellows.

2.24. Managing the Probationary Period. The first year of employment serves as the probationary
period during which the supervisor closely monitors performance and conduct to determine if the PAQ
intern or fellow should continue in the program.
   2.24.1. If poor job performance, scholastic deficiency, poor training progress, or conduct and disci-
   pline problems appear, the supervisor immediately contacts the servicing CPF Employee-Manage-
   ment Relations (EMR) or Employee Development (ED) Specialist and the PALACE Team.
   2.24.2. The supervisor and the EMR or ED Specialist provide counseling to the intern or fellow.


                                                 14
   2.24.3. If the PAQ intern or fellow fails to respond to the counseling, the supervisor notifies the PAL-
   ACE Team before separating the PAQ intern or fellow from Air Force employment.

2.25. Evaluating Performance.
   2.25.1. The initial supervisor of record serves as the rating official during the entire training program.
   EXCEPTION: PAQ interns or fellows who receive reassignments or promotions to another organiza-
   tion receive a new supervisor of record.
   2.25.2. The supervisor of record develops a performance plan using the position description and the
   T&D plan as a reference, and solicits input from the PAQ intern or fellow and other assignment super-
   visors who will participate during the rating period.
   2.25.3. After discussing the performance plan with the PAQ intern or fellow, the supervisor of record
   provides copies of the performance plan to the assignment supervisors.
   2.25.4. The supervisor of record conducts the initial 90-day and annual performance appraisals in
   accordance with standard Air Force procedures based on personal observation and input from assign-
   ment supervisors instructors.
       2.25.4.1. The second-level supervisor serves as the reviewing official.
   2.25.5. The supervisor of record follows Air Force procedures when preparing a less than fully suc-
   cessful performance appraisal and advises the PALACE Team.

2.26. Recognizing Successful Performance. Because PAQ interns and fellows receive recommenda-
tions for promotion based partly on the quality of their performance, a performance rating of "excellent"
or "superior" normally is considered to be adequate recognition.
   2.26.1. Monetary awards are not usually warranted.
       2.26.1.1. If a supervisor considers a monetary award to be appropriate, the local activity recom-
       mending the award:
           • Must provide the funds.
           • Get approval from local management and the PALACE Team.

2.27. Placing PAQ Interns. Management promotes or reassigns a PAQ intern to a permanent, locally
funded position, normally within the same MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU in which the training occurred upon
completion of training.
   2.27.1. Management may place interns up to 12 months before the scheduled training completion
   date, if the intern meets all the training and regulatory requirements.
       2.27.1.1. Management must coordinate such actions in advance with the PALACE Team and, if
       applicable, with the gaining and losing CPFs and MAJCOMs, FOAs, or DRUs.
   2.27.2. The PALACE Team gives the PAQ intern the placement offer in writing when a PCS action
   is involved.
       2.27.2.1. If the PAQ intern is within 90 days of completing training or management has extended
       the training period until identifying a locally funded position, the placement offer letter must


                                                15
      inform the intern that declining the offer will result in separation from Air Force employment in
      accordance with the mobility agreement signed when the offer of employment was accepted.
      2.27.2.2. When necessary, the PALACE Team notifies the CPF to begin separation action.

Section 2D—Internal Reviews and Evaluations

2.28. Purpose and Scope. AFCPMC/DPC and DPO conduct an annual review of the program to deter-
mine program effectiveness through feedback from MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, CPFs, supervisors, PAL-
ACE Teams, recruiters, PAQ interns and fellows, and AFCPMC/DPOR.

                                           COPPER CAP


3.1. General. The COPPER CAP program is an intern program designed to develop well-qualified,
high-potential, and highly motivated individuals to occupy full performance level positions in the con-
tracting career field.
   3.1.1. The Policy Council of the Contracting and Manufacturing Civilian Career Program (CMCCP)
   determines the scope and direction of the program and maintains policy oversight with authority to
   allocate COPPER CAP GS-1102 intern positions to the MAJCOMs.
   3.1.2. General policies and procedures prescribed for the PALACE Acquire (PAQ) intern program as
   described in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of this Air Force Instruction may apply to COPPER CAP.
   The PALACE Team answers questions regarding applicability.
   3.1.3. COPPER CAP interns are in a formal training program and are in separate competitive levels
   from the general work force in the event of a reduction in force (RIF).
   3.1.4. The PALACE Team monitors MAJCOM management of COPPER CAP positions and makes
   an annual report to the Policy Council concerning:
       • Adherence to training plans.
       • Formal training accomplishments.
       • Overall program usage and effectiveness.

3.2. Funding COPPER CAP. The PALACE Team centrally manages COPPER CAP funds provided by
the Air Force Personnel Operations Agency (AFPOA/DP) for the Policy Council
   3.2.1. Candidates accepting COPPER CAP positions, whether they are current Federal or new Air
   Force employees, pay their own initial travel and transportation expenses to the first duty location.
   3.2.2. AFPOA funds first-duty-station travel to high-cost areas, such as to Andrews AFB, MD;
   Hanscom AFB, MA; and Los Angeles AFB, CA.
   3.2.3. AFPOA funds management-initiated permanent changes of station (PCS).
   3.2.4. All COPPER CAP positions are assigned Functional Account Code (FAC) 1259. Note: The
   manpower authorization documents identify COPPER CAP positions as separate and distinct from
   any other centrally funded positions.

3.3. Allocating Positions. The Policy Council Chair allocates positions to the MAJCOM functional
managers, who assure installations fill the positions with high-quality individuals. MAJCOMs in turn
allocate their positions to their installations.
   3.3.1. MAJCOM functional managers issue directives in enough detail to operate an effective pro-
   gram that provides appropriate training and final placement for each intern.

3.4. Structure. COPPER CAP consists of basic and advanced phases, depending on the needs of the
MAJCOMs.

                                              17
   3.4.1. Basic Phase. The entry level for the basic phase begins at GS-05 or GS-07. The target grade
   ranges from GS-09 to GS-12, as determined by the MAJCOM. The minimum training period is nor-
   mally three years. EXCEPTIONS: The minimum training period is two years if the entry level is
   GS-07 and the target position is GS-09. The maximum training period is five years when the entry
   level is GS-05 and the target position is GS-12.
   3.4.2. Advanced Phase. Positions in the advanced phase concentrate on developing future managers
   or specialized skills. Entry level for the advanced phase begins at the GS-09 or GS-11 level. The tar-
   get grade may be either GS-11 or GS-12, depending upon the length of training (1 to 2 years). The
   maximum training period for a GS-12 is one year.
       3.4.2.1. Extension beyond the maximum training period requires Policy Council Chair approval.

3.5. Recruiting Candidates. Potential candidates should be highly qualified, well-motivated persons
who have demonstrated, through their academic background and/or their job experience, the aptitude and
capability to develop into successful civilian contracting leaders.

           making an offer.
   3.5.3. Advanced Phase. The selecting official must obtain MAJCOM and Policy Council approval
   to fill a COPPER CAP vacancy through the advanced phase intern program.
       3.5.3.1. All eligible, qualified, and interested Air Force employees may compete for advanced
       phase COPPER CAP positions.
       3.5.3.2. The PALACE Team issues an Air Force-wide announcement for a vacancy in response to
       a request for a certificate of candidates for an advanced COPPER CAP position.
       3.5.3.3. The PALACE Team issues a certificate to the selecting official (SO) upon receiving
       applications from interested candidates responding to the announcement. The PALACE Team
       prepares the certificate in accordance with an approved rating and ranking plan.
       3.5.3.4. The selecting official makes a selection and returns the certificate within 30 calendar
       days. The selecting official makes the offer to the candidate in accordance with any selection
       guidance procedures provided.

3.6. Conditions of Employment. The intern executes a Conditions of Employment Agreement at the
time an offer of employment is made, but no later than at the time of appointment. This agreement is fur-
nished by the PALACE Team.
   3.6.1. The servicing CPF ensures a copy of this agreement is provided to the PALACE Team after
   execution by all parties.
   3.6.2. Under the Conditions of Employment Agreement ( Attachment 1), the intern agrees to be
   mobile, to pursue the basic training objectives and activities in the ITP, and to obtain any required
   security clearances.
   3.6.3. Interns who fail to relocate when necessary may be separated from Air Force employment (see
   paragraph 3.12.).

3.7. Security. Unless an organization specifies otherwise, entry-level trainee positions are noncritical
and nonsensitive.
   3.7.1. The appropriate security clearance must be obtained if an intern requires access to classified
   information on a regular or recurring basis.

                                               19
   3.7.2. Interns who fail to satisfy the requirements for a security clearance may be separated from Air
   Force employment (see paragraph 3.12.).

3.8. Training. Because training is crucial to the development of COPPER CAP interns, MAJCOMs
must carefully develop ITPs reflecting appropriate rotational on-the-job training (OJT) assignments. The
intern, servicing CPF, organization COPPER CAP intern monitor (intern monitor), supervisor, and PAL-
ACE Team receive copies of the ITP. The CPF files a copy of the ITP in the intern’s Official Personnel
File (OPF). MAJCOMs keep copies of each ITP and review them periodically for currency. MAJCOMs
distribute changes or new plans according to the same procedures.
   3.8.1. The PALACE Team reviews each ITP for conformity with the appropriate master development
   plan (MDP). The intern monitor, supervisor, and intern use the ITP to identify formal training
   requirements for the intern, to measure intern performance against the performance plan, and to serve
   as a guide to career development and progression. The supervisor reviews the ITP with the intern at
   least annually during the annual performance appraisal.
   3.8.2. The intern monitor or supervisor identifies all formal schooling set forth in the ITP in the
   Required Training Area (RTA) of the Career Enhancement Plan (CEP). The supervisor consults the
   ITP during the annual training survey to identify formal school requirements for the year. The intern
   monitor reports any difficulties in obtaining necessary formal school quotas to the MAJCOM COP-
   PER CAP intern monitor.
   3.8.3. Supervisors will follow the rotational assignments and OJT requirements set forth in the ITP.
   Some flexibility in assignments based on mission requirements is acceptable; however, supervisors
   must immediately report significant deviations from the ITP to the MAJCOM COPPER CAP intern
   monitor and to the PALACE Team.
   3.8.4. MAJCOMs track intern progress according to the ITP and ensure documentation of all com-
   pleted training on the ITP.

3.9. Appraisals and Evaluations. COPPER CAP interns receive initial 90-day appraisals, quarterly
evaluations (semiannual after the first year), and annual appraisals.
   3.9.1. Initial 90-Day Appraisal. Using AF Form 860, Civilian Performance and Promotion
   Appraisal - Performance Plan, and input from the immediate supervisor, the supervisor of record
   conducts an initial 90-day appraisal by completing AF Form 860A, Civilian Performance and Pro-
   motion Appraisal - Performance Rating. The supervisor of record sends a copy of the intern’s AF
   Form 860A to AFCPMC/DPCQ.
   3.9.2. Annual Appraisals. Using AF Form 860 and input from rotational immediate supervisors, the
   supervisor of record conducts an annual appraisal by completing AF Form 860A. Note: The
   appraisal period is from 1 July through 30 June of each year. The supervisor of record sends a copy
   of the intern’s AF Form 860A to AFCPMC/DPCQ.
   3.9.3. Periodic Evaluations. The intern and the supervisor submit evaluations to AFCPMC/DPCQ
   on a quarterly basis during the first year, and semiannually thereafter.
       3.9.3.1. Interns provide these periodic evaluations of their training program directly to AFCPMC/
       DPCQ. The PALACE Team provides the format.



                                               20
       3.9.3.2. Supervisors provide these periodic evaluations to the PALACE Team using a
       DCPDS-generated Report on Individual Personnel (RIP). Supervisors evaluate intern perfor-
       mance and the adequacy of the ITP. Supervisors may make changes to the ITP at this time. The
       PALACE Team, servicing CPF, and intern receive copies of the completed evaluation.

3.10. Promotions. Promotions are based on meeting the time-in-grade requirement, satisfactory or better
performance on the job, successful progress as prescribed in the ITP, and a recommendation by the super-
visor of record.
   3.10.1. The servicing CPF submits a PD for the next higher grade level and career promotion (CAR-
   PRO) RIP to the supervisor of record at least 90 days before the intern is eligible for promotion. The
   supervisor of record completes the CARPRO RIP and returns it to the servicing CPF.
   3.10.2. When the intern has met all promotion requirements, the supervisor of record sends a copy of
   the SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, and a signed copy of the CARPRO RIP to AFCPMC/
   DPCQ.
   3.10.3. When the intern has not met all promotion requirements, the supervisor of record consults
   with the servicing CPF Employee Management Relations (EMR) or Employee Development (ED)
   Specialist to take appropriate action.
   3.10.4. The supervisor notifies the PALACE Team when the intern has not met all promotion require-
   ments. This notification must be given no later than 120 days before the promotion is scheduled. The
   supervisor sends a copy of all supporting documentation to AFCPMC/DPCQ. The supervisor submits
   AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, entries, quarterly reports, and annual appraisals with
   the documentation.
   3.10.5. If an opportunity period to improve performance was granted, and the intern fails to improve
   to at least the fully successful performance level, the supervisor of record will initiate action to
   remove the intern from the program (see paragraph 3.12.).

3.11. Overtime. Supervisors approve on-site overtime only in unusual situations and after they have
exhausted all other alternatives to complete the work. The policies and procedures regarding overtime as
prescribed for the PAQ intern program in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.21. of this Instruction apply to the
COPPER CAP intern program.

3.12. Counseling and Terminations. The supervisor of record will use the first year of employment in
the intern program to determine if the intern should continue in the program. The supervisor closely mon-
itors the intern’s progress in the training program and performance under the ITP and determines, before
the end of the first year, if such progress and performance are satisfactory.
   3.12.1. If an intern is not performing to the required program and ITP standards or exhibits behavior
   requiring corrective action, the supervisor of record is responsible for counseling the intern. The
   supervisor of record will involve the EMR or ED Specialist as required.
   3.12.2. The supervisor of record documents problems on AF Form 971.
   3.12.3. If the intern fails to respond to counseling, the supervisor of record notifies the PALACE
   Team before separating the intern from Air Force employment.



                                               21
       3.12.3.1. The Air Force may separate an intern who fails to receive a required security clearance,
       who fails to perform satisfactorily under the ITP, who fails to progress through the training pro-
       gram satisfactorily, or who fails to relocate when necessary under the Mobility Agreement.

3.13. Conversions to Permanent Positions. MAJCOMs place interns onto permanent, locally-funded
positions. MAJCOMs identify a permanent, locally-funded position for interns within six months of the
intern’s projected graduation date. The MAJCOM COPPER CAP intern monitor first places those interns
closest to or past their projected graduation dates.
   3.13.1. MAJCOMs who anticipate placement problems notify the PALACE Team at least 120 days
   before the projected graduation date, or as soon as they become aware of the problem. MAJCOMs
   may request a program extension for an intern not to exceed six months from the projected graduation
   date.
       3.13.1.1. MAJCOMs must formally justify a request for extension of a training program. If a per-
       manent, locally-funded position is not available at the training location, the Air Force may exer-
       cise the Mobility Agreement.
   3.13.2. MAJCOMs may request approval for early placement from AFCPMC/DPCQ if the intern has
   completed all training objectives (that is, all formal courses and OJT rotational assignments), has
   reached the target grade, and is within six months of the projected graduation date.
       3.13.2.1. The supervisor of record prepares an SF 52 to assign the intern to a permanent,
       locally-funded position. The supervisor provides AFCPMC/DPCQ with a copy of the SF 50
       assigning the intern to the permanent, locally-funded position.
   3.13.3. The PALACE Team issues AF 3518, USAF Civilian Intern Program Certificate of Com-
   pletion, to all interns who successfully complete training. The PALACE Team issues the certificates
   of completion to the MAJCOMs for presentation at an appropriate ceremony by the senior field func-
   tional official.

                                                Chapter 4

                                           PALACE KNIGHT


4.1. General. PALACE Knight (PKN) is an Air Force-wide, centrally-funded trainee program adminis-
tered by the Air Force Civilian Personnel Management Center (AFCPMC), through the Scientists and
Engineer Career Program (SECP), at Randolph AFB TX. The PKN staff includes a program administra-
tor, who operates the program, and two personnel assistants for program support.

4.2. Purpose. PKN aims to increase the doctoral level of scientist and engineering personnel throughout
the Air Force, particularly in the laboratory environment. The Air Force meets this objective by recruiting
top-quality technical talent and offering a combination of graduate education and work experience.
   4.2.1. Managing Positions. AFPOA/AFCPMC administers and manages PKN authorizations. The
   distribution of authorizations may vary each year depending upon changes in mission, projected man-
   power increases or reductions, skill requirements, funding constraints, and other operational consider-
   ations. Although PKN is an Air Force-wide program, laboratories with the greatest need for advanced
   degrees receive priority. MAJCOMs submit all requests to participate through the SECP (AFCPMC/
   DPCW), to the Air Force Chief Scientists and Technical Director Panel for review and approval. The
   panel consists of chief scientists and technical directors from participating MAJCOMs. The panel
   ensures that distribution of spaces are fair across the Air Force.
   4.2.2. Funding. AFPOA funds PKN positions for salary and moving expenses, relative to training,
   for 7 years or until completion of the Ph.D., whichever comes first. HQ Air Force Materiel Command
   funds academic costs (tuition, books, and fees) for all participants within the command. SECP funds
   academic costs for participants from other MAJCOMs.
   4.2.3. Types of Positions. The Air Force sets up PKN positions in the scientific and engineering
   career fields. Positions are in the competitive service and the Air Force fills them at the GS-07 or
   GS-09 level with a target grade of GS-13. Upon completing the Ph.D. and meeting time-in-grade
   requirements, participants may be promoted into a locally funded GS-13 target position.

4.3. Program Definition.
   4.3.1. PKN entry level GS-07 allows bachelor of science graduates and current master of science can-
   didates to proceed directly to an Air Force-funded advanced studies program for a 12- to 18-month
   period. Advanced studies are continuous and not interrupted by a work period. Students pursuing
   advanced studies must complete degree requirements within 18 months from the time of employment.
   After completing degree requirements, students relocate to the home base twelve to thirty months of
   work experience.. After this segment of training is completed, they return to the same university or
   one that the Air Force has determined is in its best interest for additional (Ph.D.) training. Participants
   complete this phase of training within 3 years.
       4.3.1.1. PKN combined M.S. and Ph.D. entry level GS-07 allows bachelor degree graduates to
       begin the program by working at least one year in the home base before enrolling. After the work
       experience, the participant proceeds to a university with an established four year M.S. and Ph.D.
       program. Participants use this option mainly in the scientific fields in which colleges and univer-
       sities don’t normally grant a master’s degree.

                                                 23
      4.3.1.2. SENIOR Knight program entry level GS-9 allows individuals with completed master’s
      degrees or Ph.D. studies in progress to be selected. Selectees with a completed master’s degree
      begin with work experience in the home base for at least one year. After one year or more, partic-
      ipants proceed to a university to begin Ph.D. studies. Participants may spend one to three years in
      advanced studies, depending on the academic status of the participant at the time of employment.
      Selectees currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program may continue pursuing studies.
      4.3.1.3. Regardless of past academic and work experience, selecting officials may not hire:
          • PKN selectees at any higher grade than a GS-07.
          • SENIOR Knight selectees above the GS-09 level.

4.4. Selecting Candidates.
   4.4.1. A team of personnel from participating organizations and led by a SECP representative
   recruits candidates primarily through college recruitment during the fall only. Each year the PKN
   staff targets a certain number of nonminority universities as well as an equal number of minority uni-
   versities for on-campus visits. Air Force laboratories and organizations conduct independent recruit-
   ment at universities having unique academic disciplines or those where Air Force research is being
   accomplished. The PKN staff sends applications to nonrecruited schools and makes them available
   through the placement office and departments.
   4.4.2. Only US citizens able to obtain and maintain security clearances may be selected. Baccalaure-
   ate applicants must be within six months of graduation and have applied to or been accepted by an
   accredited university for graduate studies. Applicants with completed Master of Science degrees or
   master's or Ph.D. studies in progress may also apply. The Air Force seeks at least a 3.25 Grade Point
   Average (on a 4.0 scale) in undergraduate studies. Candidates must take the Graduate Record Exam-
   ination (GRE). The Air Force seeks at least a combined score (verbal and quantitative) of 1000. Cur-
   rent Ph.D. candidates (not precandidates) who have not previously taken the GRE do not need to do
   so.
   4.4.3. Applicants must submit a completed SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, all col-
   lege transcripts (may be unofficial at the time of application), GRE results, and, if applicable, DD
   Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. Selecting officials contact fac-
   ulty members whom the applicant identifies on the SF 171 as references, regarding the Ph.D. potential
   of the applicant. PKN staff rates applicants as eligible or ineligible according to current OPM instruc-
   tions and procedures, and refers eligible applicants to the primary and secondary laboratory identified
   on the SF 171 for on-site interviewing.
   4.4.4. Selecting officials recommend applicants for selection according to evidence of ability, includ-
   ing: academic records, GRE scores, faculty recommendations, and academic specialty in the major
   field of study for an M.S. or Ph.D. A panel of scientists and engineers review applications and recom-
   mend selection based on individual laboratory or organization needs. The Chief Scientist of the Air
   Force grants final approval for selection. The PKN staff notifies applicants by letter of selection or
   nonselection.

4.5. Employment.




                                               24
   4.5.1. Participants enter the program as Air Force civilian employees and must comply with the rules
   and regulations of civil service employment. Each participant is assigned a mentor and a supervisor
   within their organization.
   4.5.2. Before entering duty, applicants read and sign an agreement as a condition of employment.
   This agreement states that the applicant:
       • Must complete training as outlined in a structured training and development plan.
       • Continue employment with the Air Force for three times the length of the total training period.
       • Be able to secure and maintain an appropriate security clearance.
       • Be geographically mobile.
   Participants also agree that the selection of the university or college for advanced studies and course
   work takes place in coordination with their mentor or supervisor and is in the best interests of the Air
   Force.
   4.5.3. Employment in the program begins on the day before classes start at the university, or, if the
   participant is beginning the program with work experience, on the first day of work at an Air Force
   base.
   4.5.4. Participants do not receive promotion to the GS-13 level until after they have received the
   Ph.D., satisfied regulatory requirements, and the supervisor, in coordination with the mentor, recom-
   mends the promotion. The supervisor outlines performance and training requirements in a formal
   training and development plan.
   4.5.5. The Air Force pays for designated first-duty-station travel from the selectee's residence at the
   time of selection to their first duty station or place of assignment (university). The CPF servicing the
   organization prepares travel orders and advises the selectee of allowances for current and future
   travel.

4.6. Training.
   4.6.1. General. Participants follow a structured training plan that outlines work/study progression
   and requirements. Participants receive training from a major university. The PKN staff documents all
   training and obligated time (payback for training) on DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization,
   Agreement, Certification of Training, and Reimbursement.
   4.6.2. Training and Development Plans. The supervisor of record works with the assigned mentor
   to prepare the training and development plan for the PKN participant. The supervisor and mentor
   develop training plans for each grade level and incorporate, if appropriate, both the academic period
   and the work period. The training plan outlines work or study progression and requirements and
   expectations that the Air Force will use with performance plans, appraisals, and evaluations. Mentors
   or supervisors discuss training and development plans with participants before or at the time they
   enter on duty.
   4.6.3. Selecting Schools for Advanced Studies. Part of the preselection process includes the univer-
   sity or college to which the applicant has applied or been accepted. Applicants must have applied or
   been accepted to an accredited university, recognized in the field of the specialty they are pursuing,
   before applying for the PKN. In turn, the applicant's specialty field must relate to the Air Force posi-
   tion being filled. In selecting an applicant, the selection board must approve the school to which the

                                               25
applicant has applied or been accepted. Failure to gain acceptance into the university designated on
the offer letter may result in termination from the program. The selection board may select an appli-
cant contingent on acceptance into a particular school. The selection of the school must be in the best
interests of the Air Force. B.S. applicants planning to enroll in a continuous M.S. or Ph.D. program
must begin work before enrolling and thus delay advanced studies for one year.
4.6.4. Education Plan. Participants must provide an education plan prior to enrolling in graduate
studies. Each participant lists all courses for each semester or quarter from the beginning of enroll-
ment to the completion of degree requirements based on available course information. The education
plan also indicates a projected degree completion date. The participant coordinates this date with the
faculty advisor and mentor. The PKN staff uses the date to obligate funds for salaries and academic
costs.
4.6.5. Course Load. Participants schedule a full course load for each academic term. For regular
terms, 12 semester hours or the equivalent is considered a full load. Studies will be continuous and
not interrupted with a work period until after the participant meets each degree requirement. There-
fore, participants must use the summer terms as fully as possible in order to keep their program length
to a minimum. For the summer terms, participants must carry at least 3 hours in a 5-week term, 6
hours in an 8-week term, or 12 hours in a full summer session. If the university does not provide
required courses during the summer term(s), the mentor works with the faculty advisor to assign
research or special projects during this time period. If this is not possible, the mentor, together with
appropriate management officials, may consider having the participant relocate to the home base dur-
ing the summer to do research or gain work experience. Participants follow the full course load
requirement even though the university may require less. Participants must receive approval for any
deviation to the above in advance.
4.6.6. Research. Most advanced academic degree programs require research. Where an option
exists, participants select the research option. If research is selected, careful planning is essential.
Participants must consider and coordinate with the assigned mentor the selection of an advisor and the
committee, availability of data and research facilities, and other pertinent factors. Participants supple-
ment research when required courses do not fulfill the academic load requirement rather than register
for nonrequired courses. Participants may also use summer terms for research when required courses
are not available. However, the total number of research credits scheduled should not exceed the min-
imum number of credits that the institution requires for award of the degree. Once participants have
met all course requirements, they do not need to register for a full load of formal research credits, as
long as the total program is not lengthened and the research is full-time. If the research is not
full-time, mentors may require the participant to take electives that have been determined to benefit
the program. Participants must carefully check university policies on continuous registration, num-
ber of research "credits" required for the degree sought, availability of university facilities (library,
computers, etc.) to students not formally registered, and coordinate with their mentors before choos-
ing not to register for a term or registering for a reduced load.
4.6.7. Selection of Courses. Participants schedule required and core courses as early as possible.
Research credits may be used to fulfill the academic load requirement once course requirements are
completed. If participants enroll in a non-thesis program or cannot meet the full load requirement for
a particular term, they may select designated electives within the academic major with advisor or
mentor approval. Participants do not schedule nonrequired courses just to satisfy the full load require-
ment. Participants follow their mentor’s guidance in planning their academic programs.

                                             26
4.6.8. Audit/Retake Courses. Participants may audit courses, or retake courses for which they have
previously received credit with the approval of the mentor and upon the recommendation of the aca-
demic advisor. However, they must take such courses in addition to the minimum course load. Par-
ticipants pay for audits or courses they retake.
4.6.9. Course Changes. When they anticipate a course change, participants contact their mentor for
approval. Participants who drop, add, or change a course to audit without approval of their mentor
may have to pay for the course. The Air Force and the participant set up the obligation of payment
when they implement DD Form 1556 before enrollment. By deviating from the initial planned course
of study without approval, participants are obligating Government funds without authorization and
risk disciplinary action.
4.6.10. Grade Reports. Participants submit grade reports to the PKN staff and their mentors at the
end of each term. For documentation purposes and calculation of the service commitment, partici-
pants must submit a final transcript indicating award of a degree to the PKN staff 30 days after they
have met degree requirements. Participants pay all costs related to grade reports and transcripts.
4.6.11. Academic Recognition. Participants receiving recognition for outstanding academic
achievement or election to membership in honorary fraternities or societies notify their mentors. If
the recognition includes monetary award, the participant must request, by letter to the PKN staff, per-
mission to accept the compensation. This request includes copies of documents that clearly describe
the intent and value of the compensation and a statement from the participant indicating how the com-
pensation will be used. In no case may the participant accept and use compensation without approval.
Participants are encouraged to partake in such activities when academic programs permit.
4.6.12. Academic Difficulties. If participants encounter academic difficulty, they must consult with
their advisor or professors, seek the aid of other students, or hire a private tutor (at the participant’s
expense). Above all, participants must advise their mentor whose goal it is to ensure they success-
fully complete their programs and who will work with them to help alleviate difficult situations.
4.6.13. Academic Probation. Supervisors and/or faculty place participants on probation when they
fail to meet minimum academic standards as outlined in their training and development plan or uni-
versity requirements. This action represents a warning that failure to improve may result in removal
from the PKN.
4.6.14. Clearance of Articles and Speeches. Participants must get permission from their mentors
before releasing material for publication or oral presentation (books, magazine articles, technical
papers, news releases, speeches, etc.).
4.6.15. Patent Applications. The Air Force encourages inventive talent while aiming to protect the
rights of both the Government and the inventor. Participants considering patent application consult
with their mentor or supervisor concerning their rights, responsibilities, and applicable procedures.
4.6.16. Attendance at Conferences and Seminars. Employees on full-time training may take part
in activities and meetings of nongovernmental associations, to include technical, scientific, and pro-
fessional societies. Funding and approval authorities differ depending on the purpose of the meeting.
Supervisors may use government funds when the purpose for attendance clearly meets a training
objectives. If travel at Government expense is not authorized and the employee agrees to travel at his
or her own expense, supervisors decide whether to carry the employee in a duty status (if attendance
is in the interest of the Air Force). In that situation, supervisors issue permissive TDY orders. These
orders allow individuals to be away from their permanent duty station without being charged leave. If
                                             27
   attendance is solely for the purpose of representing the university, the participant gets approval from
   the supervisor to attend. If the supervisor approves, the university or the participant pays for all
   expenses connected to the meeting. For time and attendance purposes, supervisors record the partici-
   pant as being on annual leave or LWOP, as appropriate.
   4.6.17. Tuition and Required Fee Payment. Participants provide information relating to tuition and
   required fee costs to the PKN staff. The university bursar’s office, upon authorization, bills the Air
   Force directly for these charges. Required fees are fees that are applicable to all students pursuing the
   same or a similar curriculum. The Air Force does not pay fees such as waiverable health fees, parking
   fees, charges for personal services (food, housing, laundry, utilities, and telephone), or school sup-
   plies. Telephone calls to the home organization are not reimbursable; nor are collect calls permissible.
   Participants must get advance approval for fees that the university does not identify in the university
   bulletin and does not bill through the bursar’s office, but which a department imposes, and are unique
   to that department or the university. The Air Force doesn’t pay for thesis and dissertation fees or
   related costs for typing, binding, microfilming, using computers, etc.
   4.6.18. Textbook Allowances. The Air Force reimburses participants for required textbooks. Partic-
   ipants submit SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, which
   includes copies of all textbook receipts, signed by the vendor.
   4.6.19. Contributions. Participants in the PKN are not eligible to receive any contributions, awards,
   grants, fellowships, assistantships, or payments in connection with this training.
   4.6.20. Degree Completion Dates. In nonresearch master’s programs, the completion date is nor-
   mally the last day of final examinations of the term during which the student completes all degree
   requirements. In doctoral and thesis master’s programs, the completion date is normally the date the
   student submits the thesis or dissertation in final approved form. Participants coordinate exceptions
   with their mentors (such as in the case of a dissertation being completed away from school in compli-
   ance with university requirements and the participant’s training and development plan). Participants
   must notify the PKN staff 60 days in advance of the completion date so that they may prepare the par-
   ticipant’s travel orders back to the home base.
   4.6.21. Academic Extensions. The Air Force uses the degree completion date on the participant’s
   education plan to obligate funds for academic costs, salaries, and moving expenses. The participant,
   mentor, and supervisor must ensure the participant can meet degree completion dates on or before the
   designated time frame. The participant justifies in writing, requests for an extension beyond the date
   on the education plan to the mentor and supervisor 90 days before the previous approved date. If the
   mentor and supervisor approve, they send the request through the laboratory chief scientist and com-
   mander to HQ AFMC/ST and HQ AF/ST for agreement. Recent limitations on funding make it
   unlikely that any request for extension will be approved. Therefore, failure to complete degree
   requirements in the time designated by contract may result in placing the individual in a leave without
   pay (LWOP) status until the individual meets the degree requirements.

4.7. Responsibilities.
   4.7.1. SECP. Administers the PKN in the following areas:
       4.7.1.1. Recruiting. Develops and disseminates recruiting materials and schedules and conducts

   Air Force-wide implementation, develops rating and ranking criteria for eligibility determination,
   screens applications for pre-employment, prepares job offers, and plans and conducts new
   employee orientation. Notifies the designated CPF on selection and effective date of employment.
   Provides each participant with an employee handbook describing program guidelines and policies,
   civil service employment, benefits, training requirements, and the participant’s responsibilities.
   4.7.1.3. Training and Development. Coordinates the development of nontraditional training
   plans and agreements, tracks education progress, prepares training budgets, and monitors and pays
   all academic expenses.

   gram guidelines and responsibilities and advises and counsels supervisors on appraisals, promo-
   tions, progress reports, and the completion of probation periods.
   4.7.1.5. Reports. Provides overall statistical reports on program history and progression and
   tracks education and work experience intervals and service obligation.
4.7.2. CPF. CPF that services the gaining home base processes PKN appointments and maintains
personnel records. The hiring process will be conducted by mail for those participants who will begin
employment by attending school. The CPF:
    • Arranges for the participant to take the Oath of Office at the nearest Federal location to the
       university one day prior to the start of classes.
    • Counsels participants on benefits and entitlements and instructions on preparing routine
       paperwork for entering on duty.
    • Provides managerial assistance according to Air Force regulatory guidelines and procedures.
4.7.3. Mentors. Mentors, having technical expertise in the area of specialization the participant will
be pursuing in graduate studies, provide advice, guidance, and support during the entire program
period. The mentor reviews academic progress and grades, approves selection of courses and course
load for each term, semester, or quarter before the start of classes. Mentors coordinate the partici-
pant's academic program and progress and research work with the assigned faculty advisor and con-
ducts periodic trips to the university. The mentor works with the supervisor on the participant's
training requirements and recommendations for promotion.
4.7.4. Supervisors. The supervisor of record, who is the functional manager in the area in which the
participant will be assigned, performs personnel management duties. Specifically, the supervisor
develops performance plans, appraises performance, evaluates training plans and progression, and
determines the completion or failure of the probationary period. Before recommending promotion to
the next higher grade level, the supervisor ensures that the participant has satisfactorily completed all
training and work assignments. The supervisor accurately documents time and attendance, especially
while the participant is attending classes and not physically located on base.




                                             29
4.7.5. SECP Policy Council. The SECP Policy Council, through its working group, oversees the
PKN. The working group, chaired by the Air Force Chief Scientist, meets annually, or as required, to
assess the program.

                        CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

1. The U. S. Air Force Civilian Intern and Cooperative Fellowship Programs offer excellent education,
training, promotions, and enhanced opportunities to pursue career goals after completion of required
training. Career opportunities, generally speaking, are much better than those extended to other employ-
ees because Air Force trainee programs are designed to produce employees who will be future civilian Air
Force leaders. Therefore, the Air Force trainee programs require each selected individual to sign a mobil-
ity agreement.
     a. Management must be able to assign the best qualified civilian employees to meet critical manning
needs for key managerial positions, or to provide employees with exposure to a variety of work experi-
ences to complete their development for assumption of future senior level positions. Therefore, during
your career with the Air Force, you may be required to accept assignments to other positions at the same
or higher grades, including assignment to different geographic locations. Normally, these moves will be
at government expense.
      b. Consideration will be given to your geographic and assignment preferences upon completion of
your training, but they cannot always be guaranteed. Your agreement to relocate when necessary remains
in effect until the effective date of placement in a position following completion of training. Failure to
relocate when necessary is cause for separation from Air Force employment. During your training pro-
gram, you may only receive consideration for other Air Force positions having a higher target grade than
your current position.
2. You will be required to complete your training program and meet the objectives of your training plan,
unless prevented for reasons beyond your control. The training plan can be modified by appropriate Air
Force management officials at any time to meet the needs of the Air Force. Failure to make satisfactory
progress in the training program is cause for removal from the program and may result in separation from
Air Force employment.
3. Many trainee positions, and most management positions, require a security clearance. If your position
requires a security clearance and you are unable to be granted or maintain the appropriate clearance, you
may be separated from Air Force employment.
I UNDERSTAND THE PRECEDING REQUIREMENTS ON GEOGRAPHIC MOBILITY, TRAINING
COMPLETION, AND SECURITY CLEARANCE, AND AGREE TO THEM AS CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT.
