     damage to aerospace equipment and aircraft. It is the direct responsibility of all personnel to
     ensure FOD is practiced during all aspects of local and deployed maintenance, flight
     operations and supporting functions.
     1.2. The Wing FOD Monitor is located in building T-810 in the 65 OSS Maintenance
     Supervision office.

     areas will:
        2.1.1. Account for all tools prior to and after the completion of each job using the
        tracking system required by your unit’s governing AFI or regulation. Personnel will also
        account for all tools, hardware, and consumable items whenever the work area is left
        unattended. A housekeeping inspection will also be performed upon completion of the
        task.
        2.1.2. Remove and replace all unserviceable, broken, worn, or excessively corroded
        items in the CTK. Keep hardware, etc., not in use in a container and place FO in a

        when a tool is lost on the flight line. After the Combat Air Force (CAF) IMT 145, Lost
        Tool/Object Report, is closed out, CTK custodians will inform the wing FOD Program
        Monitor when the lost tool on the flight line was found. The CTK custodian will retain
        the CAF IMT 145 for no less than 1 year or until the tool is found.
3. Aircraft Inlet/Intake/Exhaust Maintenance.
     3.1. Aircraft requiring intake/inlet maintenance will coordinate jobs through their home base
     and use the 65 ABW FOD monitor approved intake/inlet maintenance checklist.
        3.1.1. For all blade blending notify the 65th Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Quality
        Assurance (QA) office before and after the task.
        3.1.2. For Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft, 65 OSS/QA will be notified before
        and after the task by the individuals performing the work.
4. Foreign Object Damage Prevention.
     4.1. The following steps will be taken to prevent FO damage:
        4.1.1. Personnel recovering or towing fighter aircraft will execute a visual tire roll over
        FO check.
        4.1.2. Fighter Aircraft in transit will have the proper -21 equipment installed if accessible
        (F-16, F-15, A-10, etc.)

        entering all fighter aircraft cockpits.
