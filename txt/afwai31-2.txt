SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Purpose. This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for management of the
AFWA SCIF #2 (Bldg 301D) restricted area access control system.
2. Authority.
     2.1. The AFWA Security Manager (SM) is appointed by the Commander and is
     responsible for oversight of Information, Personnel, and Industrial Security Programs,
     Antiterrorism, and the Resource Protection Program, to include Automated Entry Control
     System (AECS) and American District Telegraph (ADT) controlled areas established within
     AFWA.
     2.2. The AFWA Special Security Officer (SSO) is appointed by the AFWA Senior
     Intelligence Officer and is responsible for the oversight of Sensitive Compartmented
     Information (SCI) material and all SCI security functions for the AFWA Field Operating
     Agency (FOA). Responsibilities include the direct day-to-day operations of the AFWA SCIF
     #2 (Bldg 301D), and the AECS, commonly known as the ADT card system, which is used to
     control access to AFWA facilities. Within AFWA, the SSO duties are assigned to a member
     of AFWA SSO staff.
3. General.
     3.1. General AFWA Access. Access to all areas in AFWA is controlled or limited to
     restrict access to classified areas, to protect high value resources, or to limit the flow of
     traffic through work areas to personnel conducting official business.
     3.2. Controlled Access Areas. Access to Controlled Areas is restricted to those personnel
     with required security clearance, access, and need-to-know, based on the resources or
     classified data/information contained within the area. Specific established area designator,
     area title, and the access requirements and approving officials for each is provided in
     Attachment 2.
     3.3. Temporary Access.
        3.3.1. Personnel having official business in AFWA facilities controlled by AECS for a
        minimum of 5 duty days may be granted temporary unescorted access cards. Cards are
        primarily issued to allow unescorted entry into the general facility area for visitors on
        official business and/or for extended construction/maintenance actions. Cards will be
        issued and controlled in accordance with paragraph 3.3.2. below. NOTE: Temporary
        cards will NOT be used to grant unescorted entry into classified areas established for the
        protection of classified material without validation of clearance, access, and need-to-
        know. Validation of need-to-know must be provided by the area approving authority
        listed in Attachment 2, and validation of clearance and access must be provided by the
        AFWA SM or Alternate.
        3.3.2. Temporary cards will be issued by the AFWA SSO staff and will be requested by
        the sponsor of the visit or the work performance. Cards will be issued to the sponsor,
        who is responsible for recovering the cards upon completion of the visit/work
        performance and returning the cards to the AFWA SSO staff. Requests must state the
AFWAI31-2 23 JUNE 2011                                                                       3


       purpose and duration of the visit, the number of cards required, and the sponsor's
       information. Cards not returned by the established visit end date will be changed by the
       AFWA SSO staff to "inactive" status in the control system to render them unusable for
       building/area entry.
4. Roles and Responsibilities.

       4.1.1. Safeguard issued AECS cards. If cards are lost alert AFWA SM or contract

       based on the highest level of the areas for which access is granted. PINs will not be
       recorded except by the AFWA SSO staff.
   4.2. SM/Alternate SM.
       4.2.1. Validate individual has required clearance, access, and the need-to-know for
       access to all the areas requested when AECS card requests are submitted.

       4.3.3. Ensure AECS card is turned in to the AFWA SM when an employee leaves a
