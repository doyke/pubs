1.1. Purpose. The youth program offers a wide array of organized sports activities for youth to help them
develop desirable physical skills and to mature emotionally and socially. The sports program provides
opportunities for children to have contact with other youths, volunteer leaders, and youth program staff.

Air Force community by serving as volunteers in youth programs.

1.2. Program Eligibility. Youths eligible for youth programs as authorized in AFI 34-801, Youth Pro-
grams, may participate in organized youth sports programs. The medical examination requirement out-
lined in paragraph 7.1. must be met.

1.3. Benefits. The benefits of participation in youth sports are numerous and many occur within the con-
text of a good program. Benefits include:
    1.3.1. Developing positive personal, social, and psychological skills (e.g., self-worth, self-discipline,
    teamwork, effective communication, goal setting, and self-control).
    1.3.2. Obtaining enjoyment and recreation.
    1.3.3. Developing physical fitness.
    1.3.4. Developing appropriate physical skills.

    1.3.10. Relating academic and other skills to sports performance, (e.g., how to score using numbers).

1.4. Program Philosophy and Standards. Air Force youth sports programs will follow the National
Standards for Youth Sports developed by the National Alliance for Youth Sports and develop programs
consistent with the philosophy outlined in these standards. These standards are included in Attachment
2. Bases not currently implementing all of these standards must begin doing so by implementing them for
the youngest age grouping in each sport at the start of that sport’s regular season upon publication of this
manual and continue evolving toward full implementation for all age groups by 1 October 2000. Follow-
ing these standards helps ensure that the youth sports program is fun for youth and is conducted to encour-
age the continued participation of youth regardless of their athletic ability. If a standard is required by
AFI 34-801 or other parts of this manual it must be implemented within 90 days of the publication of this
manual.

1.5. Concept of Winning. Participants can learn from both winning and losing if winning is placed in a
healthy perspective. Staff and volunteers should teach players winning is not the primary goal. Do not
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                     7

define success as winning. Teach players that losing a game or event is not a reflection on their own
self-worth. Staff and volunteers should inform participants that success is related to effort and is found in
striving for the best they can do.

                                      VOLUNTEER POSITIONS


4.1. Effective Volunteer Management. Volunteers provide the additional manpower needed to conduct
activities in the youth sports program. Volunteer services must be accepted according to AFI 34-101, Ser-
vices Programs and Patron Eligibility. AFI 34-801 provides guidance for screening volunteers and the
requirement for all specified volunteers to have an Installation Records Check (IRC). When practical, the
youth sports director should contact the last two employers of each regular volunteer before selecting the
volunteer to provide youth program services. When recruiting, tell candidates about the amount of time
required for the position and the skills needed. Explain training requirements for coaches. Guide volun-
teers to be accountable and responsible for their actions. Maintain a record of the volunteer’s hours of ser-
vice. Management must develop methods of communicating to volunteers that their services are
appreciated.

4.2. Selecting and Utilizing Commissioners and Coaches. League commissioners and league presi-
dents may be needed to assist the youth sports director in the administration of league(s). At least 2
months prior to the start date of each major youth sports program, the youth sports director should recruit
a league commissioner and president. The youth director and youth sports director should develop the
basic youth sports program policies and ensure they reflect the overall youth program policies and goals.
Commissioners and presidents may assist in the overall operation of the competitive program. The youth
director and youth sports director, with the youth support flight chief’s approval, will make final decisions
on game situations.

4.3. League Commissioners and Presidents. The league commissioners and presidents are key volun-
teer positions recommended by the youth sports director and approved by the youth director. They will be

                                     COACHES AND OFFICIALS


5.1. Coaches. Coaches, volunteer and paid, are an extension of the youth program staff. They represent
the integrity of the program being conducted and must support program objectives and policies. Coaches
must be aware of the positive and negative impacts they can have on their players. Coaches must main-
tain an atmosphere which promotes the philosophy of the youth sports program. Coaches must be respon-
sible to young athletes, parents, officials, and other coaches for:
   5.1.1. Being knowledgeable of the policies and procedures pertaining to the youth sports program.
   5.1.2. Providing a safe environment during practices, games, and related functions.
   5.1.3. Acquiring necessary training to coach young athletes.
   5.1.4. Being knowledgeable of the rules.
   5.1.5. Communicating with parents.
   5.1.6. Serving as a role model.
   5.1.7. Reporting any suspected child abuse or neglect.
   5.1.8. Adhering to the National Standards for Youth Sports.

5.2. Coaches’ Registration. All volunteer managers, coaches, and league administrators will complete
an AF Form 2040, MWR Volunteer Personal Data. A locally developed volunteer worksheet may be
used to gather information needed to match the volunteer’s interest with the youth program’s need. The
information is also useful in identifying previous youth services experience.

5.3. Coaches’ Training. Proper training must be provided for all coaches. Sports directors must ensure
coaches’ training begins before the volunteer coaches work with children and that national certification is
completed within 60 days of the beginning of the season, preferably before. The youth director must
approve any exceptions. Training will include as a minimum:
    • First aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
    • Psychology of coaching youth.
    • Injury prevention.
    • Practice organization.
    • Coaching liability.
    • Training and conditioning.
    • Child and adolescent development.
   •   Diversity and sexual harassment issues.
   •   Techniques of coaching specific sport(s).

5.4. Coaches’ Assignment Restrictions. A manager or coach in one league is normally not permitted to
manage or coach in a second league or division during the same season. The youth director and sports
14                                                                          AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

director will decide on any exceptions to this policy. A manager or head coach may be permitted to be an
assistant in another league or division. This allows the coach or manager to be with his or her child if he
or she has more than one child in the program. The league administrators and sports director will decide
on any exceptions to this policy. League administrators, commissioners, presidents, and game officials
should not be eligible to serve as managers or coaches. Exceptions must be approved by the sports direc-
tor and youth director. Game officials may serve as a coach providing they do not officiate in the same
league or division in which a team they coach is a member. Officials must not officiate in games in which
their child is playing.

5.5. Evaluation of Coaches. The youth sports director should develop an evaluation program to identify
those coaches who are able and willing to support the purposes of the youth sports program. The youth
sports director will also establish and implement procedures to identify those whose services should not
be continued because they are not fulfilling the objectives of the program. The youth sports director
should observe each coaches’ performance within the first month of volunteer service. Coaches must be
able to present evidence of competency in coaching youth sports and must be judged by the youth sports
director and youth director to be among the most qualified to serve as youth coaches. The results of the
evaluation program for youth coaches should be used to determine the most qualified. Acceptable evi-
dence for determining the most qualified may also include annual re-certification in programs such as the
National Youth Sports Coaches Association.

5.6. Removal of Coaches. The youth support flight chief may delegate disciplinary actions related to
removal of a coach to the youth director or youth sports director. If delegated, the youth director or youth
sports director is authorized to remove any coach for failure to follow the guidelines for coaches’ duties in
the youth sports program or for failure to adhere to acceptable behavior for coaches as outlined in AFI
34-801.

5.7. Trainee Coaches. When new coaches without experience enter the youth sports program, it is desir-
able to place them with experienced coaches with proven abilities. Those abilities include use of proper
teaching techniques, skill in communicating with players and other coaches, and presenting a positive
self-image at all times.

5.8. Number of Coaches. Each team should have, as a minimum, the following number of authorized
and designated managers, coaches, or assistants (exceptions may be granted by the youth sports director
for reasons such as a heavy temporary duty (TDY) schedule, military duties, or family emergency):
    • Basketball: Head coach, one assistant.
    • Baseball/softball: Head coach, one assistant.
    • Football: Head coach, three assistants.
    • Soccer: Head coach, one assistant.
    • Swimming: Head coach, one assistant.
     •   Gymnastics: Head coach, one assistant.

5.9. Selecting and Training Officials. Officials may be contract personnel or volunteers. Make every
effort to ensure sporting events and league games are officiated by qualified officials trained in the poli-
cies of the youth sports program. If qualified officials are not available, conduct certification clinics for
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                               15

officials. These may include joint clinics with other Services or youth agencies in the local community.
In training officials, consideration should be given to the following:
   5.9.1. Providing adequate space, time, materials, and qualified instructors to conduct clinics.
   5.9.2. Conducting practice games to give officials hands-on experience.
   5.9.3. Providing all equipment necessary for volunteer officials (whistles, chest protectors, masks,
   ball, and strike counters, etc.). Paid officials will be responsible for their own equipment.

                                       PARENT INVOLVEMENT


6.1. Parent Involvement. Involve parents in conducting the youth sports program. Conduct orientation
programs to inform parents of the benefits and risks of the specific sport activity. Offer parents the
National Standards for Youth Sports shown in Attachment 2. Provide parents the basic rules of the
sports, and proper conduct for both parents and athletes during practices and games. Also provide infor-
mation on how to promote good sportsmanship and skill development for their child. Link parents with
what happens in their child’s life through sports activities.

6.2. Referral Systems. Support customers’ youth sports pursuits even when it’s not possible to directly
provide the program or service the youth or parent is seeking. There are four areas which should be
addressed through referrals:
     6.2.1. Information. Youth sports participants want to know more about their favorite activity. Keep
     them enthused by setting aside an area in the youth center with information devoted to their interests.
     6.2.2. Interest groups. Refer customers to individuals and local groups that share their interests. A
     bulletin board should be available for local activities.
     6.2.3. Locations and destinations. Many customers already know what they want to do but need help
     in finding out where to go in the local area. Provide maps, brochures, and/or local community guides.
     6.2.4. External suppliers of programs, services, or equipment. Since it is not possible to provide the
     setting customers may want, help them find someone who can.

                                            HEALTH ISSUES


7.1. Physical Examinations and Evaluations. Prior to participating in youth sports each child must
have a physical examination. It is not necessary for a child to have an examination prior to the start of
each sport during the year, but each child must have a yearly examination. Youth participating in Air
Force youth sports programs must have the immunizations required by the American Academy of Pediat-
rics and the Centers for Disease Control for children of their age. The latter should be confirmed as part
of the annual physical examination. If a large number of physicals are required, the youth director should
coordinate special arrangements with the Chief of Hospital or Clinic Services at the medical treatment
facility at least 2 months in advance. When feasible, Physical Therapy should be involved in providing
the sports physicals.
   7.1.1. Chronic Health Problems. Coaches must be alert to children who have chronic (on-going)
   health problems. Get detailed information from parents at the time of enrollment about specific health
   issues. Ensure this information is recorded on the child’s enrollment form so that it will be available
   in the event of a change in coaches or staff.

7.2. Conditioning. Solicit parents’ help in the conditioning of young athletes. Stress conditioning as an
important step in preventing injuries. The conditioning process should include physical and mental prep-
aration including motivating to compete, learning the sport and its rules, getting into shape though physi-
cal exercise, and developing good nutritional eating and sleeping habits.

7.3. Replenishing Fluids. Players should bring personal water bottles to practice fields and games when
water fountains are not available. The coach should also bring additional water and cups. Players should
drink plenty of water, especially during hot, humid weather. Salt tablets should never be administered to
youth athletes. Encourage players to use the buddy system to watch for symptoms of heat prostration.

7.4. Awareness of Warning Signs. Medical assistance should be sought when the following warning
signs are experienced by either players or coaching staff:
   7.4.1. Irregular pulse, fluttering sensation in the chest.
   7.4.2. Dull ache or heavy pressure sensation in the upper abdomen or chest.
   7.4.3. Unusual shortness of breath (with or without chest pain).
   7.4.4. Sudden numbness (especially in the left arm).
   7.4.5. Extreme dizziness, loss of coordination, or loss of consciousness.
   7.4.6. Sudden inability to see or speak.

7.5. First Aid Training. All paid and volunteer coaches and instructors participating in the youth sports
program must have current certification in first aid and CPR and must be prepared to respond to emergen-
cies which may occur during practices and games. Staff and volunteers must receive annual training on
blood pathogen universal precautions and the exposure procedure to follow. Contact the Surgeon Gen-
eral’s medical consultant to the youth program for assistance in identifying a source for the latter training.
18                                                                         AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

7.6. Presence of a Qualified Medical Trainer. Since most Air Force youth sports events occur on an
Air Force base with a physician available in the clinic or hospital, the presence of a qualified medical
trainer at practices or games is not required. (Exception: Youth football games, tackle.) However, if the
sport is occurring off base and medical treatment is not readily available, the presence of a qualified med-
ical trainer is recommended. The head coach, or in his or her absence the assistant coach, must know
where the closest telephone is in case of an emergency and how to obtain medical assistance at the loca-
tion where the event is being held.

7.7. Playing After Injury or Illness. AFI 34-801 provides guidance on players returning to activities
after injury or illness.

7.8. Weight Gain or Loss. Weight gain or loss to establish eligibility in programs such as wrestling or
football is not recommended for youth athletes unless it is under the direction of a physician.

7.9. Combat Sports. Boxing is not authorized for youth sports programs.

7.10. Notification About Accidents. Complete the AF Form 1187, Youth Flight Accident Report, for
any injury requiring professional medical treatment and any fatality in any program. The youth director
must report both in writing and telephonically all cases reported on the AF Form 1187 to the youth flight
chief or his or her supervisor. Have the youth flight chief notify the MAJCOM; Headquarters, Air Force
Services Agency, Child Development and Youth Programs Branch (HQ AFSVA/SVPAC), (telephone
DSN 487-4045 or fax DSN 487-2383); and Headquarters, United States Air Force, Services, Program
Policy Division (HQ USAF/SVP), (DSN 664-6421 or fax DSN 664-0323) within 24 hours of an accident
that results in the death or hospitalization of a youth.

7.11. Emergencies. In case of an accident requiring professional medical assistance, follow local Oper-
ating Instruction procedures for emergency assistance. The head coach, or in his or her absence, the assis-
tant coach, must have the telephone numbers for the emergency room and ambulance service. This
person must also be knowledgeable of where the nearest telephone is located from the practice or game
area.
     7.11.1. Giving First Aid. The head coach, or in his or her absence, the assistant coach, must be calm
     with the youth, regardless of how serious the injury may be. American Red Cross (or an equivalent
     program) first aid procedures must be followed. Bleeding should be stopped and the wounds should
     be dressed with sterile bandages before players are allowed to return to play. Staff and volunteers
     should handle blood and body fluids according to the procedures outlined in the National Health and
     Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs. Staff or volun-
     teers must wash hands with soap and water immediately after exposure to blood or body fluids follow-
     ing procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control guidelines. A portable first aid kit
     provided by the youth center must be available to support each team. The kit will contain adhesive
     bandages, sterile gauze, tape, liquid soap, disposable rubber or plastic gloves, zip-lock bags, small
     scissors, chemical cold packs, tweezers, and CPR mouthpiece with barrier. The requirement for
     chemical ice packs can be deleted when ice is available on site.

                                            SAFETY ISSUES


8.1. Safety Program. The youth staff, in coordination with base safety personnel, will develop a youth
sports safety program plan designed to minimize the number of injuries in the youth sports program.
Consider factors that may cause accidental injuries such as improper physical condition, emotional stim-
ulus, and level of physical development that often accompanies competitive physical activity, overexer-
tion, overly aggressive acts, infringement of rules, faulty equipment or facilities, inadequate supervision,
lack of space, too many participants, and (or) lack of administration. The responsibility for safe play must
be shared by the youth staff, league administrators, team coaches, officials, parents, and players.

8.2. Facilities Guidelines. Use the following guidelines to promote the safety of participants and specta-
tors:
   8.2.1. Indoor facilities should have dry, non-slippery floor surfaces that are kept clean.
   8.2.2. Clear the area behind basketball goals.
   8.2.3. Keep spectators at a safe distance from playing courts.
   8.2.4. Ensure outdoor fields are free of trash, glass, sharp objects, ruts, grooves, or potholes.
   8.2.5. Do not allow obstructions on the sidelines.
   8.2.6. Gymnastics and exercise mats are free of rips and tears.
   8.2.7. Secure all goals.
   8.2.8. Use goal post pads, flexible flags, and rubberized sideline markers.
   8.2.9. Ensure a flat stable pitcher’s plate and home plate.
   8.2.10. Secure fences and remove projections and obstructions.
   8.2.11. Ensure bleachers are free from protrusions, sharp edges and splinters, loose bolts, cracked
   support braces, and improper locking mechanisms.
   8.2.12. Ensure protection of spectators from the batting area for baseball and softball.

8.3. Appropriate Clothing. Clothing must be appropriate to the sport and the environment. Encourage
parents to provide participants with a good fitting pair of shoes appropriate for the sport. Light, loose-fit-
ting clothing made of natural fibers or a blend with cotton helps promote air circulation to the skin. They
help keep the player cooler in hot weather and act to prevent chilling in cold weather.

8.4. Protective Equipment. Use sanctioned protective equipment, if available from the industry, in
youth sports activities. This equipment must carry the National Operating Committee for Standards In
Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) approval for
safety. Do not practice or play without the proper equipment. Make sure the equipment fits the youth
using it. Do not use broken equipment. Do not alter any equipment without permission from the manu-
facturer. Equipment and supplies that further prevent injuries while playing are listed at Attachment 3.

8.5. Environmental Conditions. Exposure to extremes of environmental temperatures may upset the
body’s internal temperature regulation, resulting in serious health problems. Factors to consider are air
temperature, percent of relative humidity, wind speed, lightning, altitude, and air pollution. Injuries and
fatalities may occur when proper precautions and preventative measures are not applied. The command
post should notify the youth center’s supervisor on duty of any severe weather warnings so that outside
activities can be curtailed as necessary. Encourage players to wear sunscreen and sunglasses on sunny
days.

8.6. Managing Program Risks. The youth sports program must follow stringent standards of supervi-
sion in order to minimize the potential for accidents, injury, and fatalities. Management and coaches must
be knowledgeable of their legal responsibilities. Equipment and playing facilities must be maintained in
safe condition for the purposes for which they are intended. To minimize the risk of injury:
     8.6.1. Warn players of potential dangers in each sport.
     8.6.2. Teach activities by progression of difficulty.
     8.6.3. Use trained, qualified personnel.
     8.6.4. Conduct and document training programs.
     8.6.5. Provide proper and safe equipment and facilities.
     8.6.6. Provide adequate and timely medical treatment.
     8.6.7. Establish and enforce safety and disciplinary rules.
     8.6.8. Develop and implement standard procedures for inspecting and maintaining athletic equipment
     and facilities.
     8.6.9. Distribute safe and properly fitting equipment bearing the NOCSAE seal, if applicable.
     8.6.10. Arrange for proper supervision of all activities.
     8.6.11. Determine the physical condition and impairments of athletes.
     8.6.12. Ensure proper warm-up exercises and stretching are part of practice and game routines.
     8.6.13. Instruct athletes on safe techniques and use of equipment.
     8.6.14. Review AF Form 1187 to identify patterns.
     8.6.15. Establish and follow procedures for minimizing the potential for child abuse and neglect.

8.7. High Risk Activities. AFI 34-801 outlines the requirement for proof of the instructor’s qualifica-
tions in certain high risk sports, such as, but not limited to gymnastics, wrestling, and karate instruction.
AFI 34-801 gives the required adult-to-child ratios for group activities. Lower staff/child ratios should be
maintained for some high risk activities, such as swimming or gymnastics to protect the health and safety
of the participants.
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                 21

                                  CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS


9.1. Emergency Conditions. When an emergency such as a natural disaster or conflict occurs on the
installation or in the local area, the support group commander may suspend the youth sports program until
the program can be safely be operated. When children and youths are brought into an installation as the
result of emergency conditions at another installation, special efforts should be made to help the youth
transition to their new environment including modifying the sports program when necessary. In these sit-
uations the commander may waive the annual youth programs registration fees in order for youth to par-
ticipate in sports and other activities. Offer opportunities for the new arrivals to participate in youth
sports activities. Assist new families with information on getting required physical examinations for par-
ticipants in organized youth sports program. As required, schedule special instructional clinics for the
new participants joining the program under emergency conditions.

                                        YOUTH PROTECTION


10.1. Youth Protection Guidelines. The Air Force is committed to providing safe recreational settings
for youth program participants. AFMAN 34-704, Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect in Child Care
Settings, provides general guidance and will be used in conjunction with AFI 34-801.

10.2. Barriers to Child Abuse. No isolated one-on-one communication or contact between an adult and
a youth is permitted. If situations require personal conferences, such as a coach’s conference with a youth,
the discussion is to be conducted in full view of other adults and youths. All aspects of the youth sports
program must be open to observation by parents.

10.3. Transporting Youths. AFI 34-801 provides guidance for transporting youths. When the youth
program transports youths, the name of the driver, the names of the passengers, the time of departure and
expected return, and destination must be reported in advance to the youth director or the supervisor on
duty. A procedure must be in practice for parent notification in case of emergency or changes that would
affect the youth’s arrival at home or a pick-up/drop-off time or location. Staff and volunteers may not
transport youth in their private vehicles without written permission from the parents. Staff or volunteers
will not transport youths in vehicles not designed for passengers, e.g., the back of a pickup truck.
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                    23

                          SUPERVISION, GUIDANCE, AND DISCIPLINE


11.1. Supervision. The youth director must ensure children and youths participating in youth sports are
supervised for their protection and well-being. According to AFI 34-801, two adults must be present at all
times when youths are present unless the area is being monitored by closed circuit surveillance. One adult
must be a staff member, contract employee, or specified volunteer with required background checks. The
additional person can be an adult volunteer. If several teams are practicing or playing on an outdoor area
or in a gymnasium a minimum of one person with completed background checks is required.

11.2. Guidance and Discipline. Follow the guidance in AFI 34-801 and local written discipline policy
for youth programs. The youth program staff and volunteers must follow the guidance policy. The
behavior of any youth program staff or volunteers that is not in compliance with the guidance policy
should be reviewed by the youth sports director and the youth director and a recommendation made on
their continuing in the program to the youth flight chief. Any youth program staff member or volunteers
who are under investigation for child abuse or neglect are to be restricted from contact with youth until the
investigation of the allegation is completed. Any youth staff member or volunteers who are found to have
been involved in a substantiated allegation of child abuse or neglect may not participate in the youth
sports program in any position which involves contact with youth. The youth director, with the approval
of the youth flight chief, establishes procedures for temporary and permanent suspension of youths who
do not follow the written rules of conduct. Procedures must include working with parent(s) to try to
resolve misbehavior. When it is necessary to remove a child from a team for disciplinary reasons, the
action must be approved by the youth director. The action should be based on the recommendation of the
child’s coach and youth sports director, and should be consistent with other similar actions.

11.3. Positive Guidance Techniques. Youth staff and volunteers must demonstrate the use of positive
guidance techniques and require that parents assisting them in the conduct of practices and games also use
positive guidance techniques. Coaches are to use positive guidance techniques which help youths
develop self-control, self-esteem, and respect for the rights and property of others. Techniques include
talking with the youth, helping the youth use negotiation to resolve conflicts, temporarily removing the
youth from the situation for a few minutes, and limiting the youth’s participation in the activity.

11.4. Supervision of Coaches and Officials. The sports director will monitor the officiating and con-
ducting of games and require players and coaches to abide by the playing rules and respect officials. The
sports director will attend as many games as possible, evaluating facility maintenance, team performance,
officiating, and snack bar operations. The youth director and youth flight chief are also to periodically
attend practices and games to ensure they are being conducted according to the National Standards for
Youth Sports (Attachment 2).

                                                 Chapter 12

                                    PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES


12.1. Emphasis on Participation. The emphasis in youth sports, especially for the younger age groups,
will be on skill development, enjoyment, and maximum participation. The intensity of competition for
children under 12 years of age can be minimized by eliminating all-star teams, playoffs, league standing,
player statistics, purchase of full-dress uniforms, and post-season tournaments. Parents must be advised
prior to sign-up that the sport is recreational in nature with emphasis on skill development and fun; and
that competition is not the main objective of the youth sports program.

12.2. Participation. Opportunities to participate in youth sports must be available for young athletes at
all levels of playing ability. Each child must be given equal opportunity to play in every game. Use of
perpetual batting order is recommended for T-ball to ensure equal playing time. The youth sports director
will establish specific guidelines for youth sports and modify rules to meet certain criteria for particular
sports and age groups. Mandatory playing rules may be waived for injury or discipline when the action is
approved in advance by the youth sports director.
     12.2.1. Guidelines for Program Components. Attachment 4 gives the parameters for organizing
     youth sports programs for participants ages 5 through 18. The guidelines should be followed for chil-
     dren who are maturing at normal rates. Ensure the youth sports program is conducted in a way that
     focuses on what is best for children and youth at their stage of development and growth. Participation
     must be appropriate for the youths’ level of ability and development.
     12.2.2. Age Groupings. When there are sufficient numbers of participants to field teams, no more
     than 2-year age groupings must be used. In no cases may an age grouping involve an age spread
     greater than 3 years without the approval of the MAJCOM youth specialist. Females, 15 and over,
     may participate in leagues for adult females when there are not sufficient numbers of females to offer
     leagues for girls. Any other participation of youth in adult leagues must be approved by the MAJ-
     COM youth specialist.
     12.2.3. Participation of Both Sexes. Provide both boys and girls opportunities to participate in indi-
     vidual and team sports. Gender specific sports activities may be offered to facilitate maximum partic-
     ipation by girls and boys, but participation in any league may not be restricted to one sex.

12.3. Game Modification. The youth sports director (with approval from the youth director) is autho-
rized and may modify rules for sports or use of equipment where such changes will make play less dan-
gerous, reduce inappropriate physical demands on young players, or make the sport more appropriate and
enjoyable for young athletes.

12.4. Player Special Placement. The youth sports director is authorized to move a gifted or less gifted
athlete into another age group when it is in the best interest of that child or the other children playing that
sport and the parents of the child have approved the change. Such changes will be based on established
written criteria. Movement of more than one age group is discouraged. Parent’s permission for such
moves must be obtained and the overall social and physical developmental level of the child considered.
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                 25

12.5. Specialization of Position. Rotation of children into different playing positions facilitates skill
development and is consistent with the purposes of youth sports. At younger age levels (10 years and
under) children should be rotated among positions during practices and game play.

12.6. Coaching and Instruction During Games. For younger age groups, ages 5 to 6 years old, rules
should allow for instruction to occur during games and practices. This will reduce the overemphasis on
competition and make it possible for coaches to instruct fundamental skills at critical moments for learn-
ing. Over-coaching (yelling, criticizing and providing extensive direction) during games or practices is
not permitted.

                                         LEAGUE STRUCTURE


13.1. Program Organization and Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the youth sports program
include program organization, maintaining program unity and discipline, volunteer training, establishing
program policy, ensuring safety within the program, establishing and ensuring compliance with program
by-laws, and establishing and conducting coaches certification programs. The initial formation of leagues
is a key factor in the organization of the sports program. No one system will be effective in all situations;
however, an example is presented in Figure 13.1.

13.2. National Affiliation and Participation in Regional and National Competitions. T h e y o u t h
director must weigh the cost of national affiliation and participation of selected teams or players in
national and regional competitions against the overall benefits received by the total group of children
involved in the sports program. Use of youth sports program funds for these activities must be approved
in advance by the youth flight chief.

13.3. Playing Rules. The basic playing rules for each sport will be the national or official association
rules for children closest to the age of the players participating.

13.4. Player Selection and Team Organization. The system used for player selection must be as fair as
possible to all teams and individual players and the process documented in step-by-step written instruc-
tions to league administrators and coaches. Written information on this process must be also be available
for parents at their request. The youth sports director and league administrators must be present during
the draft and monitor the process.
     13.4.1. Player Draft System. Two types of player draft systems are provided at Attachment 5.
     13.4.2. Player Rosters. After players are selected, each coach must be furnished a roster of all players
     assigned to his or her team. The coach must have this roster at all scheduled games and must make it
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                   27

   available to any league official or opposing coach upon request. Parents should also be provided cop-
   ies of these rosters for use in scheduling transportation of their child to and from games and practices.
   With the written permission of each child’s parent(s), include the names of each child’s parents and
   their phone number to aid parents in making transportation arrangements. Use a consent form to
   request the parents’ written approval to release their names and phone numbers to other parents.
   Ensure local registration form contains the Privacy Act Statement when asking for personal informa-
   tion such as the parent’s phone numbers.

13.5. Base/Community Leagues. It may be necessary to join and play among off-base leagues when the
base league does not have sufficient teams to provide an enjoyable program for the youths. Use of appro-
priated funds is authorized for group fees. Youth sports director should coordinate with off base leagues
to obtain mutual agreement on league rules and guidelines.

13.6. Scheduling Games. Use RecTrac! software to schedule league games and ensure full participa-
tion. The "round robin" scheduling system is the most common type of competition used in league play.
This system is effective in providing for full participation and in determining team ranking in leagues for
older youth, ages 11 and up. Season rankings should be determined by the won-lost record using two
points for a win, one point for a tie, and no points for a loss.

13.7. Alteration of Schedules. Only the youth sports director with the cooperation of the league admin-
istrators, may change, cancel, postpone, or alter playing schedules. The youth sports director is responsi-
ble for canceling games due to inclement weather or other unforeseeable circumstances before play
begins. Once play begins the head official will make the determination. The youth sports director will
establish provisions for "make-up" games prior to the start of the regular season or tournament.

13.8. End of Season Ties. If a tie exists at the conclusion of a season, and no post-season tournament is
planned, there is no need for a tie-breaking system. However, if a tie exists (for any place) and post-sea-
son play is scheduled, head-to-head competition between the tied teams should determine the higher
placed team(s). If this method does not clearly determine a winner, the won-lost record against the high-
est placed team is used. This method continues through the standings until a winner is determined. (
Note: To prevent running up the score during the season, no consideration will be given to total offen-
sive and defensive points when determining a winner.)

13.9. Post Season Competition. Special competitions, tournament games, bowl games, or other compe-
titions between base and off-base leagues must be scheduled by the youth sports director with approval of
the Services squadron commander. Rules governing the event will be covered in pre-season meetings.

13.10. Number and Length of Practices and Games. The information in Figure 13.2. should be used
in establishing practice sessions and the season for games and competitions. Deviations from these rec-
ommendations must be approved by the youth sports director.

                             CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE ACTIONS


14.1. Conduct. Establishing and maintaining the highest standard of conduct must typify all behavior in
the youth sports program. Behavior inappropriate for programs serving youth by coaches, managers,
players, parents, and administrators must not be tolerated. Poor sportsmanship, cursing, vulgarity, or
obscene gestures are not allowed on the part of an individual. Alcoholic beverages are not permitted at
any function or activity sponsored by the youth sports program. The youth sports director should solicit
help from coaches and parents to provide a smoke free environment at all youth sports events. Youth par-
ticipating in youth sports activities should not be exposed to second hand smoke. Smoking by staff,
coaches, and youth during any practices or competitions is not permitted. Misuse or abuse of playing
equipment; negative comments about coaches, players, or officials: prolonged disputes with officials; and
throwing objects onto or into the playing area will be considered unsportsmanlike conduct.

14.2. Discipline. The youth director will develop local operating instructions on conduct and discipline
of players, coaches, parents, and league administrators in the youth sports program. These instructions
must be posted in the main youth facility and must be available in written form for individuals requesting
a copy.

14.3. Protest Board. Establish a protest board to serve in an advisory capacity to the youth sports direc-
tor in resolving formal protests in competitive leagues. This group of disinterested parties should give
recommended action on the protest to the youth director and/or the youth support flight chief. The recom-
mendation should be provided in writing. The board will, at a minimum, consist of two knowledgeable
but disinterested parties, normally another league president, the president of the league involved, the
league commissioner, or the commissioner of officials. The youth director and youth sports director, with
the youth support flight chief’s approval, make the final determination on protests.
   14.3.1. League Protests. The primary goal of the youth sports director in handling protests should be
   to keep such conflicts away from the young athletes. The most effective resolutions are those that
   have the least effect on the players and the program. An official protest submittal should contain the
   following information.
       14.3.1.1. Entry by the official in the official score book at the time. (Both team coaches in the
       game, the official and the official scorekeeper must be aware of the protest before further play is
       resumed.)
       14.3.1.2. The date, time, and place of the contest; team involved and the names of the game offi-
       cial(s).
       14.3.1.3. All facts pertinent to the situation in question (score at the time, time remaining, exact

                                      RECOGNITION OF PLAYERS


15.1. Program Awards. Awards and recognition may be part of the youth sports program; however,
their importance must be kept in perspective and minimized. Conduct programs for the fun of participa-
tion. Achieving awards and winning must not be the program’s primary purpose.
     15.1.1. Team/Individual Awards. Present awards for participation, for a job well done, for demon-
     strating good sportsmanship, and to recognize those teams and players which have succeeded in team
     performance. Awards should be of limited size and price. Emphasize individual awards for sports-
     manship, team work, etc. at all age levels. Individual awards for superior play (e.g., most valuable
     player, best hitter, best offensive player, high scorer, etc) are permitted only in activities for youth 13
     and older. Solicitation by any individuals or groups associated with the youth sports program to pur-
     chase "luxury" items or extra awards (e.g., warm-up suits, jackets, jerseys, sweat bands, etc.) is pro-
     hibited.
     15.1.2. Participation Awards. Giving patches, certificates, or T-shirts to all players for participation
     is encouraged. However, participants who are dismissed from a team for disciplinary reasons or those
     who resign or quit before the end of a season, including playoffs, are not eligible for recognition
     unless their departure is related to the transfer or retirement of their parent or their parent’s absence
     because of a prolonged TDY or deployment.

15.2. Promises. Under no circumstances may promises of special activities, functions, awards, or prizes
be made to the players, their coaches, or parents by coaches, team parents, or volunteers unless prior
approval is given by the youth sports director. Such activities do not include team parties or other minor
functions which promote team unity.

                           FACILITIES, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT


16.1. Appearance and Condition of Facilities. The appearance and condition of playing facilities are
important to the successful conduct and safety in the youth sports program. Youth sports directors must
place special emphasis on facility maintenance. Safety is a major concern when maintenance is per-
formed. Keep the areas and all equipment clean and ready for use.

16.2. Pre- and Post-Season Inspections. A pre-season inspection of sanctioned practice areas and game
facilities must be completed at least 30 work days prior to the start of any team practice. The inspection
team includes representatives from civil engineering, ground safety, environmental control, medical facil-
ity, the youth director, the youth sports director, and other personnel appropriate to the particular base.
Utilizing the expertise of each team member will help ensure a safe playing area and safe playing condi-
tions. Action must be taken immediately to correct noted discrepancies. The youth sports director should
develop a checklist of procedures to be done before each game, after each game, daily, and weekly. From
the date practice begins until the last game played, the area must be inspected daily by the youth sports
director or assigned maintenance personnel and sustained at the required level. A post-season inspection
by the youth director should be completed not later than one month after the season ends in order to plan
and seek funding for correction of deficiencies. See Attachment 6 for a pre- and post-season inspection
guideline.

16.3. Turf Maintenance. The maintenance level for field turf should be based on the grass species
present or selected; the turf quality desired; the geographical area, the climatic conditions; the intended
use of the facility; the amount of time, personnel, and money available; and the training and capabilities
of the maintenance team. Consult the civil engineer agronomist for assistance with aerating, seeding, and
fertilizing.
   16.3.1. Skinned Surface Areas. Maintenance of the field skinned areas requires special care. The
   local physical features of the fields will dictate the relative amounts of sand, silt, and clay required.
   Work closely with the base civil engineer to maintain a proper soil balance. The following are spe-
   cific maintenance techniques relating to the skinned area of athletic fields:
       16.3.1.1. Have coaches drag the skinned portion of base/softball diamonds and base paths every
       day immediately after practice or a game so that if it rains during the night, the area will dry
       smooth and not leave pockets for water to stand. Dragging of a non-grassed infield should begin
       from the edge of the outfield grass and work towards the pitching rubber in a circular pattern.
       Once the pitching rubber area is reached, the dragging should continue in a circular pattern to the
       outfield grass-line area. Alternate the drag direction every other day.
       16.3.1.2. Have wire leaf rakes and street brooms on hand to sweep and rake out rain soaked areas.
       Raking out dirt playing surface allows the air and sun to mix with surface dirt and speeds the dry-
       ing process.
       16.3.1.3. Stockpile additional clay and soil/dust to replace material lost by wind or to fill low
       spots.
32                                                                          AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

         16.3.1.4. To maintain the proper configuration of the baseball/softball infield, use a sod cutter in
         the early spring, followed by an edging once a month during the playing season.
         16.3.1.5. Ensure mosquito and tick control measures are conducted to minimize the potential for
         bites to children and spectators. Consult with the medical and civil engineering staff as required.

16.4. Supplies and Equipment. Consider the local factors that influence the purchase and maintenance
of uniforms and equipment. Examples of factors are location of base, size of program, age of participants,
funds available, time involved to obtain, number of facilities, vendor availability, cleaning and repair ser-
vices available, storage space available, safety considerations, and staff expertise in maintaining.
     16.4.1. Uniform Purchasing. It is cost-effective to order stock items from one of the major companies
     on General Services Administration or Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office
     (AFNAFPO) contracts. Collect uniforms within 1 week after the end of the season. After the uni-
     forms have been returned and cleaned; inventory and determine the need for additional items. This
     practice is of utmost importance in overseas or isolated locations because of the additional 60- to
     90-day delay in delivery. Youth sports directors must be cautious of purchasing annual fill-in uni-
     forms from different companies. Few companies offer the same color and design as another company.

16.5. Equipment Care. The proper care of equipment extends its useful life and enhances the safety of
the program. Proper care, use, and repair/replacement are the responsibility of the youth sports director.
Suggestions for proper care of equipment age given in Attachment 7.

16.6. Storage. Each youth program must have a place(s) to store youth sports equipment and supplies if
team and individual sports are offered. Storage rooms must be well organized, clean, have sufficient air
circulation, and adequate lighting. Guidelines include:
     16.6.1. Store all articles off the floor, on shelves or racks.
     16.6.2. Ensure aisles between storage shelves and distance from top shelf to ceiling of storage room
     measure at least 2 feet.
     16.6.3. Arrange seasonal items together with the most frequently used items easily accessible for
     quick removal.
     16.6.4. Keep a running inventory of all supplies.
     16.6.5. Keep an inventory of all equipment/uniforms as well as a documented equipment/uniform
     replacement plan.
     16.6.6. Ensure the storage of equipment and uniforms is done in such a way as to minimize health
     risks to youth and the potential for fire hazards.

                                     PROGRAM EVALUATION


17.1. Program Evaluation. Use a variety of techniques to evaluate the youth sports program and obtain
input from coaches, officials, parents, and youth. A combination of observation, interview, written eval-
uations, and studies of existing records and reports may be used in evaluating the sports program. Use the
evaluations to:
   17.1.1. Determine the effectiveness of the sports program in relationship to its mission and objective.
   17.1.2. Pinpoint program areas requiring special attention.
   17.1.3. Change the program to meet needs.
   17.1.4. Obtain information for basis of corrective actions.

17.2. Evaluation Data. In evaluating the sports program, the objectives of the program must be
reviewed prior to, during, and after the program. Compare findings from the evaluation process with the
objectives, and corrective measures taken in the areas where improvement is needed. In the evaluation
process, collect data about:
   17.2.1. Scope of the program and various program phases.
   17.2.2. Methods of administration and effectiveness of established policies and procedures.
   17.2.3. Adequacy of the staff in terms of number, training, experience, and personal attributes.
   17.2.4. Extent to which facilities meet program requirements.
   17.2.5. Availability of supplies and equipment.
   17.2.6. Measures taken to encourage participation.
   17.2.7. Quality and amount of advance planning.
   17.2.8. Attitude of participants and spectators.
   17.2.9. Number and nature of disciplinary actions.
   17.2.10. Injuries and illnesses occurring during practices and competitions.
   17.2.11. Satisfaction of youth and parents with the program.

                                             BOOSTER CLUBS


18.1. Booster Clubs. Booster clubs are classified as Type 3 (Independent) private organizations (PO).
AFI 34-123, Private Organizations Program, provides guidance and procedures for establishing and
operating POs on Air Force installations. Booster clubs operate as self-sustaining special interest groups,
set up by people acting outside the scope of any official position they may have in the Federal govern-
ment. The installation commander determines if a booster club will make a positive contribution to the
lives of base personnel and whether or not it conflicts with government activities, e.g., youth programs.

18.2. Purpose of Booster Clubs. With the installation commander’s approval, a youth sports booster
club may be organized to fulfill the needs and interests of Department of Defense families. Youth direc-
tors should maintain a positive relationship with all established youth booster clubs to foster complemen-
tary support for developmentally sound Services’ youth programs. Services squadron commanders or
directors must ensure that youth sports booster clubs do not usurp the youth sports programming respon-
sibilities. The installation commander may withdraw his or her authorization if the PO prejudices or dis-
credits the United States Government, conflicts with government activities, or for any other reasonable or
just cause.

18.3. Establishing a Booster Club. Specific requirements to establish a PO are covered in AFI 34-123.
The booster club group must submit a written constitution, bylaws, or other similar documents, outlined
in the Private Organization Guidance Handbook, through the recreation support flight chief, Services
squadron commander or director, and Staff Judge Advocate for consideration by the installation com-
mander.

18.4. Operating Booster Clubs. Installation commanders provide limited supervision over POs. Their
control lies in the power to authorize and withdraw authorization for the organization to operate on the
installation. They ensure compliance with the requirements of AFI 34-123, but do not control or dictate
internal activities or structure of the booster club PO. There will be no direct financial assistance to a
booster club PO from a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) in the form of contributions, divi-
dends, or donations of monies or other assets. AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), pro-
vides guidance on acceptance and use of contributions, donations, and commercial sponsorship in youth
programs. POs may not solicit, or accept unsolicited, commercial sponsorship, but may be the beneficia-
ries of unsolicited gifts and donations.
     18.4.1. Logistical Support. Booster clubs must furnish their own equipment, supplies, and other
     materials. The Air Force may provide a meeting place to Type 3 POs. Reimbursement to the Air
     Force is not required if a PO only occasionally uses a facility and such use is minor relative to its offi-
     cial uses. Only when the booster club’s activities are in progress can a sign or insignia or other orga-
     nizational identification be placed on or inside government facilities.

18.5. Fund-Raising Activities. AFI 34-123 guidance on PO fund-raising activities must be followed.
The installation commander, or his or her designee, may authorize booster clubs occasional sales for
fund-raising purposes like bake sales, dances, carnivals, or similar nonrecurring functions. Booster clubs
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                              35

must not engage in activities that duplicate or compete with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service or
Services activities or NAFIs. Booster clubs may not sell alcoholic beverages.

                          NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR YOUTH SPORTS


A2.1. National Standards. (These standards are published by the NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR
YOUTH SPORTS and were developed in 1987 by 48 of the nation’s leading experts representing a wide
variety of disciplines affecting youth sports. They have been endorsed by over 200 agencies and organi-
zations interested in youth sports.)

A2.2. Standard #1--Proper Sports Environment:
     A2.2.1. Background. There is a wide variety of youth sports experiences available to children. Some
     of these begin as early as five years of age and include both collision and non-collision sports, elite
     and recreational play categories, single age and multi-age participation ranges and unstructured to
     highly-organized and competitive programs.
     A2.2.2. Rationale. Because all children physically and emotionally mature at different rates, parents
     must evaluate very carefully their child’s youth sports experience. Parents must consider and carefully
     choose the proper environment for their child, including the appropriate age and development for par-
     ticipation, the type of sport, the rules in the sport, the age range of the participants, and the proper
     level of physical and emotional stress. To assist parents in achieving this goal Air Force youth sports
     programs will offer opportunities for participation in youth sports in which
        A2.2.2.1. Leagues have a minimum play rule per game for all children regardless of ability.
        A2.2.2.2. Leagues organize programs within a two year age range, such as, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12,
        etc.
        A2.2.2.3. Leagues allow post-season play only for regular season teams and not engage in choos-
        ing post-season All Star teams.
        A2.2.2.4. Leagues establish a policy of not cutting players and provide an opportunity for mean-
        ingful play for all children.
        A2.2.2.5. If awards are given, leagues give participation awards and reduce emphasis on compet-
        itive trophies.
        A2.2.2.6. League standings are not used below the age of 9 and are de-emphasized below the age
        of 13 by using only end-of-season results.

A2.3. Standard #2--Programs Based on Well-Being of Child:
     A2.3.1. Background. Many organized play experiences for children are carbon copies of adult-ori-
     ented programs. The rules, skill expectations and competitive requirements are the same as in high
     school, college, and professional levels.
     A2.3.2. Rationale. Youth sports programs should be based on maximum participation. The program
     should focus on organizing meaningful play. Coaches should let children be involved in making deci-
     sions. The level and length of athletic competition should be commensurate with the physical and
     emotional development of the child.
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                              39

  Parents must select youth sports programs that are developed and organized to enhance the emotional,
  physical, social and educational well-being of children. Air Force youth sports programs will assist
  parents in achieving this goal by providing youth sports opportunities in which:
     A2.3.2.1. Leagues are operated using the following guidelines:
         A2.3.2.1.1. For 5 to 6 year olds a developmental program is offered:
            • There are no regular competitive teams.
            • Scores or standings are not kept.
            • Rules, equipment, and the field are modified to match the abilities of the players.
            • Uniforms are limited to T-shirt and hat.
            • There are no scheduled leagues, tournaments, or all-star competition.
            • Leagues and coaches are not permitted to require sport specialization.
            • Play is co-recreational.
             •   No travel is involved.
             •   Coaches are permitted on playing surfaces.
         A2.3.2.1.2. For 7 to 8 year old's a sports introduction program is offered in which:
            • Informal teams are used.
            • Scores or standings are not kept.
            • Rules, equipment, and fields are modified to match the abilities of the players.
            • Limited uniforms are provided.
            • There is no tournament, post-season play or all-star competition.
            • Co-recreational play is encouraged.
            • Travel is within the local community only.
            • Coaches are permitted on playing surfaces.
            • Leagues and coaches are not permitted to require sports specialization.
         A2.3.2.1.3. For 9 to 10 year old's an organizational program is offered in which:
            • Scores are kept but standings are de-emphasized.
            • Rules, equipment, and fields are modified, where necessary to match the abilities of
                the players.
            • There is no out-of-community post-season play.
            • There is no national tournament participation.
            • Leagues and coaches are not permitted to require sports specialization.
     A2.3.2.2. For 11 to 12 year old's a skill enhancement program is offered, in which:
        • Expenditures on uniforms for appearance reasons are minimized.
        • Limited ability grouping are used following proper grouping procedures.
        • A variety of position and situational plays are encouraged.
40                                                                          AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

        A2.3.2.3. Coaches are required to avoid teaching the use of sports to punish opponents through
        physical contact or excessive score domination.
        A2.3.2.4. Year round participation is not required by leagues or coaches.
        A2.3.2.5. Leagues adopt rules banning rapid weight loss/gain solely for participation in youth
        sports.
        A2.3.2.6. Children below the age of 11 years may participate only in activities that contain lim-
        ited collision potential and feature modified rules that will significantly reduce the chance of
        injury.
        A2.3.2.7. Leagues consider weight and skill in grouping children.
        A2.3.2.8. Coaches apply proper principles of conditioning and nutrition.

A2.4. Standard #3--Drug, Tobacco, and Alcohol-Free Environment:
     A2.4.1. Background. Pressures and opportunities for children to be involved in drug, tobacco and
     alcohol abuse have increased to crises proportions during the past decades. Unsupervised social inter-
     action and unknowledgeable adult leadership have contributed to the problem.
     A2.4.2. Rationale. Coaches and parents must be educated about all drugs, including performance
     enhancement chemicals. Leagues should have policies dealing with drug, tobacco and steroid use and
     emphasizing prevention through education. Parents, league administrators, and coaches should be
     taught what to look for in abuse of these drugs and know how to access community resources for
     assistance on drug-related problems.
     Parents must encourage a drug, tobacco and alcohol-free environment for their children. Air Force
     youth sports programs will assist parents in this effort by offering youth sports programs in which:
        A2.4.2.1. Leagues adopt rules prohibiting the use of alcohol, illegal substances or tobacco by
        coaches, league administrators, or game officials at all youth sports events.
        A2.4.2.2. Leagues provide coaches and parents educational information on identifying signs and
        symptoms for substance use by children.
        A2.4.2.3. Leagues establish policy and implementation procedures for immediately dealing with
        substance use by coaches and players and communicate these policies to coaches, players, and
        parents.
        A2.4.2.4. Leagues continually encourage dialogue between coaches, players and parents about
        the need for an alcohol, tobacco and drug-free environment for children.

A2.5. Standard #4--Part of a Child’s Life:
     A2.5.1. Background. The foundation for human development occurs during the early years of life.
     Individuals are exposed to many different learning situations to increase their potential for successful
     development.
     A2.5.2. Rationale. Parents, coaches and league administrators need to encourage children to be
     involved in a variety of activities while recognizing that the home, church, school and a variety of
     other social experiences are all a part of a child’s growth and development. Parents must respect a
     child’s decision not to play. Coaches and parents must realize that youth sports involvement also has
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                  41

   ramifications for the entire family. Parents should insist that youth sports participation not detract
   from the child’s academic progress.
   Parents must recognize that youth sports are only a part of a child’s life. To help parents achieve this
   standard the Air Force youth sports program will offer programs in which:
      A2.5.2.1. Leagues adopt a policy that allows for and encourages participation in a variety of
      youth activities in addition to the child’s particular sport.
      A2.5.2.2. Leagues and coaches do not demand year-round involvement in a particular sport as a
      condition of meaningful participation.
      A2.5.2.3. Leagues establish rules that limit organized practices to no more than 1 hour a day and
      three days a week through the age of 12 and not more than 1 1/2 hours and four days a week
      through the age of 16.
      A2.5.2.4. Leagues adopt a policy that makes provisions for excused absences through parental
      requests for church, school, and other family activities.

A2.6. Standard #5--Training:
   A2.6.1. Background. Sports participation can lead to harm if those responsible have no training. In
   most cases, youth sports organizations allow volunteers to coach without performing any background
   check.
   A2.6.2. Rationale. Parents should insist that coaches are educated in the following areas: psycholog-
   ical and emotional needs of children, safety and first aid, conditioning and nutrition, teaching proper
   sports techniques and drug awareness.
   Parents must insist that coaches are trained and certified. To help parents in meeting this goal Air
   Force youth sports programs will ensure:
      A2.6.2.1. Leagues require coaches be annually trained and certified in the areas of the emotional
      needs of children, safety and first aid, conditioning and nutrition, teaching proper sport tech-
      niques, and drug and tobacco education.
      A2.6.2.2. League administrators and officials are trained in the aforementioned areas.
      A2.6.2.3. Leagues use appropriate and available screening techniques for selecting and assigning
      coaches to ensure that children are protected from abuse.
      A2.6.2.4. Leagues are encouraged to provide additional educational resources for coaches to
      assist them in providing the best possible youth sports experiences for each child.
      A2.6.2.5. All coaches sign a code of ethics pledging their commitment to provide an enjoyable,
      healthful youth sports experience.

A2.7. Standard #6--Parents’ Active Role:
   A2.7.1. Background. Many parents pass their youngsters over to others, relying on someone else to
   take responsibility for their child’s youth sports experience.
   A2.7.2. Rationale. Parents are the key. They need to demonstrate the positive benefits of a youth
   sports experience by attending games, practices, or team social events; or by taking the time to volun-
42                                                                          AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

     teer as a coach or league official; or by just expressing their positive support. Parents should discuss
     with their child why the child is participating and help him/her in evaluating his or her experience.
     Parents must make a serious effort to take an active role in the youth sports experience of their child
     providing positive support as a spectator, coach, league administrator and/or caring parent. In order to
     encourage and support parent participation Air Force youth sports programs will ensure:
        A2.7.2.1. Parents are required to attend a league orientation meeting. This may be one-on-one
        with a league official, if necessary.
        A2.7.2.2. Teams are required to have a minimum of one team/parents’ meeting each sports sea-
        son.
        A2.7.2.3. Leagues advertise for parent involvement in roles such as, coach, team manager,
        fund-raiser, league manager, special assistant, and fan.
        A2.7.2.4. Leagues encourage parent-child communication about their youth sports experience
        through newsletters, team meetings, coach-parent and coach-player discussions, and league hand-
        books and guidelines.

A2.8. Standard #7--Positive Role Models:
     A2.8.1. Background. Children will follow the example of the adult role model and in particular, the
     parent. Children will copy or imitate their parents’ sports behavior, including the development of val-
     ues based on that behavior.
     A2.8.2. Rationale. If the youth sports experience is to be a positive one for each child, parents must
     also demonstrate sportsmanlike behavior as a fan, coach, and league administrator. They need to
     encourage fun, give lots of praise for the little successes along the way and, when a child makes a mis-
     take, separate the mistake from the child. Parents need to encourage peer support and give positive
     verbal support to team members, opponents and coaches of their child.
     Parents must be a positive role model exhibiting sportsmanlike behavior at games, practices, and
     home while giving positive reinforcement to their child and support to their child’s coaches. To help
     ensure that children are presented with positive team models Air Force youth sports programs will
     require
        A2.8.2.1. Leagues have a sportsmanship/conduct code prohibiting unacceptable behavior, e.g.,
        berating players, coaches, and officials; use of vulgar language, and intoxication.
        A2.8.2.2. Leagues communicate conduct requirements to coaches, parents, players and spectators
        through newsletters, handbooks, postings, and announcements.
        A2.8.2.3. Leagues develop an enforcement plan for implementing a sportsmanship code includ-
        ing removal procedures.

A2.9. Standard #8--Parental Commitment:
     A2.9.1. Background. Individuals that sign commitments are usually more positive and supportive of
     their children.
     A2.9.2. Rationale. The parents should be knowledgeable of the opportunities and responsibilities for
     having their child involved in youth sports. They should also be requested to demonstrate their com-
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                    43

   mitment by signing a code which outlines the opportunities their child should have through participa-
   tion, as well as the responsibility the parent has in supporting the youth sports experience.
   Parents must demonstrate their commitment to their child’s youth sports experience by annually sign-
   ing a parental code of ethics. The Air Force will encourage all parents or guardians of children who
   desire to have their child participate in the youth sports program to sign such a commitment.

A2.10. Standard #9--Safe Playing Situation:
   A2.10.1. Background. Children participating in youth sports are exposed to a variety of facilities,
   training programs and organized risk taking opportunities. Most adult leaders do not have coaching
   degrees or university coaching certification.
   A2.10.2. Rationale. Coaches and league administrators have the responsibility to inspect and ensure
   proper maintenance of facilities; have knowledge of proper equipment fitting, selection and appropri-
   ate use; understand the physical consequence of improper skill techniques; have the ability to modify
   rules for safe-playing situations; understand the physical need for a proper child-oriented conditioning
   program; understand proper weight control practices and have knowledge of prevention and first aid
   for athletic injuries including the ability to implement emergency procedures.
   Parents must insist on safe playing facilities, healthful playing situations and proper first aid applica-
   tions, should need arise. In order to ensure that Air Force youth sports programs provide these condi-
   tions:
      A2.10.2.1. Leagues develop procedures for inspecting playing facilities for safety hazards before
      every youth sports activity.
          A2.10.2.1.1. Leagues select equipment designed to ensure injury reduction for participants,
          (e.g. baseballs designed to reduce injuries, soccer shin guards, approved protective equipment
          in contact sports).
          A2.10.2.1.2. Leagues develop procedures for continual safety selections of all playing equip-
          ment.
          A2.10.2.1.3. Leagues ensure that teams have a fully equipped first aid kit at all youth sports
          activities.
          A2.10.2.1.4. Leagues establish a plan for coaches on how to handle all emergencies at youth
          sports activities.
          A2.10.2.1.5. Leagues establish procedures to ensure that all teams and events have an emer-
          gency first aid plan and equipment for dealing with injuries, hazards and weather conditions.
          A2.10.2.1.6. Leagues do not allow participation during unsafe conditions, such as, lightening
          storms, darkness, playing sites in disrepair, etc.
          A2.10.2.1.7. Leagues remove coaches that knowingly require or allow a player to play while
          having a serious injury or knowingly create unsafe play situations.
          A2.10.2.1.8. Leagues require coaches to have CPR and advanced first aid training.

A2.11. Standard #10--Equal Play Opportunity:
44                                                                           AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

     A2.11.1. Background. The cost of participation in youth sports has risen dramatically during the past
     several years as have the number of single parent families. Although sports opportunities for girls and
     racial minorities have improved, many adults still fail to recognize the contribution of the youth sports
     experience for all children.
     A2.11.2. Rationale. All children must have the opportunity to play regardless of race, creed, sex,
     economics status or ability. The coaches and league officials should recognize sex/role stereotyping
     and demand that racial prejudice of any type be prohibited. Every effort should be made to provide
     financial assistance to those youngsters unable to afford participation, including the cost of safe equip-
     ment. Adult youth sports leaders must teach tolerance of, and respect for, people of all abilities, sizes,
     shapes, colors, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Youth sports should be a growth rather than a
     limiting experience.
     Parents, coaches and league administrators must provide equal sports play opportunity for all youth
     regardless of race, creed, sex, economic status or ability. Toward that end Air Force youth sports pro-
     grams must ensure:
        A2.11.2.1. Leagues adopt a non-discrimination policy that ensures participation for all youngsters
        regardless of race, creed, sex, economic status or ability.
        A2.11.2.2. Leagues make provisions so that all youngsters may be able to participate regardless
        of their financial ability to play.
        A2.11.2.3. Leagues are encouraged to provide co-recreational programs through age 12.
        A2.11.2.4. Leagues adopt an affirmative action coaching recruitment policy that provides for the
        recruitment and selection of qualified women and minorities.

A2.12. Standard #11--Drug, Tobacco, and Alcohol-Free Adults:
     A2.12.1. Background. Sports participation has long been characterized as a means of developing
     character and positive values. Recent information indicates that competitive pressures, negative
     sports peer group associations and unhealthy adult role models may actually increase the risk of drug,
     tobacco and alcohol use among youth participants.
     A2.12.2. Rationale. Because of the influence they exert, parents involved in youth sports should
     understand that they must refrain from substance use, including smoking, alcohol consumption, chew-
     ing tobacco, and illegal drugs at games, practices and other youth sports events. Healthful role mod-
     eling should lead the way in influencing youngsters to avoid drug, tobacco and alcohol use.
     Parents as coaches, fans, and league administrators must be drug, tobacco and alcohol-free at youth
     sports activities. To help parents meet this standard Air Force youth sports programs must ensure:
        A2.12.2.1. Leagues require coaches, league administrators and game officials to refrain from the
        use of alcohol, illegal substances and tobacco at youth sports events.
        A2.12.2.2. Leagues require that alcohol will not be sold or allowed to be brought into youth sports
        games and practices.
        A2.12.2.3. Leagues encourage spectators not to use tobacco at youth sports events.
        A2.12.2.4. Leagues develop an enforcement plan for removing coaches, parents and spectators
        who are under the influence of alcohol or illegal substanaces.

                                       PLAYER DRAFT SYSTEMS


A5.1. Optional Player Draft System Number One:
     A5.1.1. Step 1. Explain the objectives and procedures of the draft. Make certain all coaches under-
     stand the system.
     A5.1.2. Step 2. Explain to the coaches:
        A5.1.2.1. Coaches are only distributing talent and are not selecting the team they will be coach-
        ing. Team assignment will be determined by draw after the teams are equalized.
        A5.1.2.2. When completing the roster of players as the draft progresses, make certain full names,
        ages, experience and telephone numbers are entered on the team roster forms being compiled.
        This information will be needed later in the draft and will save a lot of time and research. As play-
        ers are selected from the master list, make certain all coaches delete them from their copy of the
        master list.
     A5.1.3. Step 3. In the case where siblings need to be transferred after the draft, wait until all coaches
     have been assigned before making any changes.
     A5.1.4. Step 4. The sports director will place numbers in a hat equal to the number of teams. The
     head coach or his or her representative from each team will then draw one number for order of player
     selection. Pass out team roster forms with numbers matching the number drawn. The team that draws
     #1 will be assigned team #1 and will have first choice in the first round of the draft, #2 gets second
     choice, #3 third, and so forth.
     A5.1.5. Step 5. Draft the players in the order just drawn, using the "Z" method as shown below:

"Z" METHOD OF ORDER OF DRAFT

(4 TEAM, 20 PLAYER EXAMPLE)


                         Team #1             Team #2            Team #3             Team #4
First Round                 1                   2                  3                   4
Second Round                8                   7                  6                   5
Third Round                 9                  10                 11                  12
Fourth Round               16                  15                 14                  13
Fifth Round                17                  18                 19                  20


     A5.1.6. Additional Factors. In some instances, and if the coaches so desire, age, weight, height and
     experience may be compared by averaging the totals of each team selected. In most cases, coaches
     rely on their own ratings of the players over the averages of such criteria.
AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996                                                                                   49

   A5.1.7. When to Draw. After all coaches, league administrators and the sports director are satisfied
   that the teams are as evenly matched as possible, the draw for teams will begin. If controversy exists
   over the matching of teams, the sports director has final authority.
   A5.1.8. Step 6. Player draft is completed, coaches shall draw for the team they will coach.
   A5.1.9. Step 7. After teams have been drawn, siblings will be transferred to the appropriate team.
   This transfer must be made between players of equal or better ability according to the order the play-
   ers were drafted (i.e., a parent coach who wants his or her sibling transferred to their team must trans-
   fer to the losing team an equal round draft choice or higher). The child of the assistant coach may not
   be transferred if both child and the head coach’s child are number one draft choices.

A5.2. Optional Player Draft System Two:
   A5.2.1. Initial Sign-Up:
      A5.2.1.1. Obtain past experience of players (position, and number of seasons).
      A5.2.1.2. Include space for parents to print their names (coaches will need during season).
      A5.2.1.3. Add to current sign-up sheet:
         • Any injuries or medical conditions the coaches should be aware of.
         • Both parents work telephone numbers.
         • Height, weight, shirt and pants size, etc.
   A5.2.2. Team Selection. Prior to player evaluations (try-outs):
      A5.2.2.1. League administrators fill in applicable information on evaluators rating list:
         • Points for player's age.
         • Points for seasons played.
      A5.2.2.2. Brief all evaluators:
         • Point system.
         • Look for skills not results.
         • Be consistent.
         • Double check totals.
         • Sign evaluator's check list.
      A5.2.2.3. Have a minimum of four evaluators (evaluators must be experienced in the sports):
         • Non-coaches.
         • Coaches in the same division.
         • Coaches from other age divisions.
   A5.2.3. During Player Evaluation:
      • Separate evaluators.
      • Do not allow evaluators to compare scores.
      • Run each participant through a drill before beginning another.
50                                                                         AFMAN34-804 1 MAY 1996

     A5.2.4. Post Player Evaluations:
        • Turn in rating list to league administrators.
        • Stand by for player distribution.
     A5.2.5. League Administrators' Responsibilities. Rank all players, highest number of points to low-
     est. Drop players' personal names and then assign number for each player. Place player's number on
     rating list - hold for coaches until after team selection. Write player's number, total points and any
     other comments (i.e., pitcher, catcher, etc.) on a blackboard or on large sheet of paper.
     A5.2.6. Final Team Selection:
        • Coaches equally distribute players (coaches are unaware of players names). Add totals for
            each team. Arrange totals as close as possible.
        • Coaches draw teams.
        • Coaches get their own child by trading a player of equal or higher ability.
        • Siblings can be placed on the same team only if both coaches agree to the trade.
     A5.2.7. Head Coaches' Children. Parent head coaches may automatically be assigned their son or
     daughter; however, the number of coaches allowed this privilege per team should be determined at the
     beginning of each season for each respective sport.
     A5.2.8. Additional Player Assignments. After the player draft, assignment of players remaining
     should be made only by the sports director or league commissioner.
     A5.2.9. Setting Team Roster Limit. The number of players on a team roster will be determined by the
     number of players registered. The number should be as evenly matched between teams as possible.
     Player assignment after the draft should be based primarily on the relative strength of the teams, with

                                EQUIPMENT CARE SUGGESTIONS


A7.1. Care of Inflated Balls:
   A7.1.1. Store balls inflated, but at less than normal pressure unless the manufacturer specifies other-
   wise.
   A7.1.2. Always moisten the needle, preferably with glycerin, when inflating a ball with a rubber core
   valve. If the needle is moistened with the mouth, remove moisture from needle. A rusty needle will
   damage the core of the valve.
   A7.1.3. Always use a pressure gauge to ensure correct inflation. Inflation materially affects the shape
   and the life of the ball. Correct pounds of inflation are normally inscribed on the ball.
   A7.1.4. Clean inflated balls regularly with a good saddle soap or ball cleaner. Air dry.
   A7.1.5. Dry balls that have been out in wet weather at normal temperature. Never store near a radia-
   tor or other heating units.

A7.2. Care of Badminton, Squash, and Tennis Rackets:
   A7.2.1. Keep rackets in a cool, dry storeroom.
   A7.2.2. Check for cracks and possible frayed strings. Repair strings immediately.

A7.3. Care of Tennis, Volleyball, and Badminton Nets:
   A7.3.1. When not in use, loosen nets to relieve stretching. In damp areas, use tarred creosote net for
   best results.
   A7.3.2. If steel cables are used to support nets, oil and keep in constant repair.

A7.4. Care of Table Tennis. Store table tennis equipment when not in use. When necessary, paint the
table tops with a coat of flat floor paint. Keep surface clean, nets straight, and the edges of the table
sanded and painted.

A7.5. Care of Mats:
   A7.5.1. Carry, never pull, mats across the floor. Clean canvas mats with a vacuum cleaner and every
   three months clean with a commercial mat cleaner, if available. Clean rubber and plastic mats with
   soap and water. If rips and tears appear, use rubber or plastic patches to repair the outer surfaces.
   A7.5.2. Repair minor tears and rips in canvas mats with a heavy needle and thread. Have major
   repairs made by experienced personnel at the factory or at the base parachute shop if these services are
   available. Never paint canvas mats.
