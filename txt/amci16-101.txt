This publication establishes the policy, procedures, roles, and responsibilities for implementing
and executing the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Corporate Governance Process (CGP). The
CGP implements a planning and control process for providing information to and receiving
direction from AMC/CV and CC. This instruction implements policy guidance in AFI 38-101,
Air Force Organization; AFPD 10-1, Mission Directives; AFPD 16-5, Planning, Programming,
Budgeting and Execution Process; DODD 7045.14, The Planning, Programming, Budgeting,
and Execution (PPBE) Process. The CGP is designed as a vehicle to achieve a consolidated
command position on issues. The CGP also facilitates AMC situational awareness to support
United States Transportation Command’s (USTRANSCOM) CGP. It applies to all HQ AMC
Directorates and their staff, 18th Air Force Commander (18 AF/CC) and staff, and the USAF
Expeditionary Center. This instruction combines previous functional CGPs into a single
command CGP. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air
National Guard (ANG) units, but AFRC and ANG liaisons may participate as special advisors to
the AMC Group, Board, and Council. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all
direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
certification and approval. Submit comments and suggested improvements on AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change to Publication, through channels to HQ AMC/A5Q, 402 Scott

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction redefines AMC’s CGP in its entirety. It institutes a deliberative process
executed cyclically and is synchronized with the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and
Execution (PPBE) process and the Defense Acquisition System independently and in concert
with USTRANSCOM’s CGP. AMC’s CGP is designed to create a battle rhythm for
requirements information flow and resource decision-making within HQ AMC. The process
fosters the efficient pursuit of AMC strategic goals while maximizing the effective execution of
available resources through informed prioritization and collaborative value judgment.

1. Objective. Establish an efficient and effective requirements and resources decision-making
process for HQ AMC. Decisions may be made at any level in the CGP commensurate with the
authority of the activity chair. There are no monetary thresholds for topics unless otherwise
established under separate correspondence. Furthermore, topics may cover any appropriations,
to include Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF). Established processes which result
in a multi-directorate level approved position will be briefed as information only to the AMC
Group and Board and proceed to the AMC Council.
2. Organization

Figure 1. AMC Corporate Governance Process




   2.1. The AMC Group is chaired by AMC/A5Q. The Group members include AMC/A1M,
   AMC/A2X, AMC/A3R, AMC/A4P, AMC/A6X, AMC/A7N, AMC/A8P, AMC/A9A,
   AMC/FMA, EC/DS, 18 AF/CS, AMC/DSB, AMC-CVO, AMC/DPA, AMC/TEP,
   AMC/SEE, and AFICA/KMP (effective 1 Oct 2013 – advisory only).
   2.2. The AMC Board is chaired by AMC/A5/8. The Board members include AMC/DA1,
   AMC/DA2, AMC/DA3, AMC/DA4, AMC/DA5/8, AMC/DA6, AMC/DA7, AMC/DA9,
   EC/CV, 18 AF/CS, AMC/DS, AMC/DFM, AMC/DIG, AMC/DSE, AMC/DSG, AMC/DPA,
   AMC/DTE, and AFICA/KMP (effective 1 Oct 2013 – advisory role).
   2.3. The AMC Council is chaired by AMC/CV. The Council members include AMC/A1,
   AMC/A2, AMC/A3, AMC/A4, AMC/A5/8, AMC/A6, AMC/A7, AMC/A9, AMC/FM, 18
   AF/CV, EC/CC, AMC/DS, AMC/IG, AMC/SE, AMC/SG, AMC/TE, AMC/PA, and
   AFICA/KM (effective 1 Oct 2013 – advisory role).
   2.4. Recurring Action Teams, such as Chief Information Officer (CIO) updates (see
   Attachment 5), manage recurring topics. These teams are led by the appropriate/relevant
   functional lead. These teams must use the AMC CGP as the means of seeking an AMC
   Command position. The CGP Secretariat will be responsible for ensuring action officers are
   able to do so by publishing the process and making it accessible to those requiring support.
 4                                                          AMCI16-101 14 JANUARY 2014


     2.5. Quick Action Teams manage special interest items generated through the CGP such as
     Fiscal Year (FY) Execution Strategy proposed by AMC/FMA. The Group, Board, or
     Council may initiate these teams and will designate an action team lead in each case. The
     team is disbanded once the issue is resolved or at the discretion of the CGP at the same or
     higher level that initiated the team.
     2.6. The AMC CGP Secretariat (A5Q) is responsible for preparing meeting materials,
     meeting venues, invites, meeting minutes, and managing the AMC Corporate Governance
     mail box and AMC Corporate Governance milBook site. See paragraph 6 for more details.
3. HQ AMC Corporate Governance Process.
     3.1. When practicable, the AMC Group convenes the first Thursday of each month. The
     Group reviews topics, to include CGP-related USTRANSCOM issues, to determine if
     resolution can or should be accomplished at the Group level or carried forward to the AMC
     Board for consideration. Topics must be ready for Directorate level review before being
     cleared to the Board.
     3.2. When practicable, the AMC Board convenes the second Thursday of each month. The
     Board reviews Group-approved topics to determine if resolution can or should be
     accomplished at the Board level or carried forward to the AMC Council for consideration.
     The Board also reviews the USTRANSCOM Oversight Council (TOC) agenda for AMC
     equities. The Board chair will request information from the appropriate directorate
     representative to support AMC positions at the TOC.
     3.3. When practicable, the AMC Council convenes the fourth Tuesday of each month. The
     AMC Council is the final requirements and resources decision authority for the majority of
     large scale or broad scope AMC programming issues. The AMC Council also receives
     updates on AMC planning and programming activities, to include items impacting the Rapid
     Global Mobility (RGM) Core Function Master Plan and the RGM Core Function Lead
     Integrator. Furthermore, the Council also reviews the USTRANSCOM Corporate Board
     (TCB) agenda for AMC equities. The Council chair will request information from the
     appropriate directorate representative to support AMC positions at the TCB.
     3.4. An out-of-cycle AMC Group, Board, or Council may be conducted in the event a new
     issue arises requiring awareness or a decision is required within the CGP which cannot wait
     for the established battle rhythm.

AF Council    2nd/4th Thurs AF Issues discussed

4. Topics of Discussion.
   4.1. Any significant resource or requirement issue that warrants consolidated command
   attention, decision, or position may be submitted for consideration. A call for topics shall be
   distributed to the directorates via Task Management Tool (TMT) the last week of each
   month. Suggested topics shall be submitted in the Public Workspace of the TMT call for
   topics using the Topic Template (Attachment 2). Topics deemed by the CGP Secretariat to
   be more appropriately handled through the Council of Deputies or via Defense Connect On-
   line (DCO) will be redirected to those venues. Visit the AMC Director of Staff EIM site for
   Council of Deputy information (https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/amcds/default.aspx).
   4.2. Topics may be informational or decisional. Topics requiring a decision will be
   presented, discussed, and decided at the lowest possible CGP level. After introduction and
   discussion, a topic may evolve from informational to decisional, or vice versa. If a topic is
   deemed undeveloped and a decision can be postponed, the topic may be tabled for CGP
   reconsideration in the future once it is supportable.
   4.3. Topics may be recurring or nonrecurring. Recurring topics will be managed by
   Recurring Action Teams and led by the appropriate Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR).
   Recurring topics may be monthly, quarterly, or annual. Nonrecurring topics are usually
   submitted by the OPR through the TMT call for topics. There may be topics that are
   generated through discussions in CGP forums or as a response to AF or USTRANSCOM
   concerns. These topics shall be assigned to and managed by the appropriate OPR. In the
   event multiple directorates are involved in the topic, a Quick Action Team may be
   established and an OPR assigned. In the event responses are time sensitive the Group,
   Board, or Council Chair may approve use of alternative meeting forums (e.g. DCO, Video
   Teleconference, telecom).
5. Topic Material.
   5.1. There are several templates which OPRs must adhere to when presenting CGP topics. All
   presentations will include the Topic Template (Attachment 2). Other templates are available at
   the AMC Corporate Governance milBook site (https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/amc-
   corporate-governance). Please note that you must request access to the CGP milBook site and
   it is restricted to Government employees. The duration of presentations should shorten as a topic
   proceeds through the levels of the CGP. Ideally, only complete and succinctly-presented topic
   slides will be put before the AMC Council.
       5.1.1. Presented information should be clear and concise, and presenters should come
       prepared to answer anticipated questions. Slides and other read ahead material should be
 6                                                           AMCI16-101 14 JANUARY 2014


        submitted to the CGP Secretariat through the AMC Corporate Governance mailbox at
        amccorporategovernance@us.af.mil. Read ahead material shall be posted on the AMC
        Corporate Governance milBook site shown above. Classified material may be mailed via
        SIPRNet e-mail directly to a CGP Secretariat. Members of the Secretariat are identified
        on the AMC Corporate Governance milBook site.
     5.2. When practicable, read ahead material should be submitted to the CGP Secretariat no
     later than two duty days prior to the presentation. When classified materials are sent, OPRs
     should follow-up by contacting the e-mailed Secretariat member directly to ensure he or she
     is aware that classified materials were sent on SIPRNet and to explain what parts of the
     briefing and/or read ahead materials are classified.
6. Meeting Minutes.
     6.1. The Secretariat shall draft meeting minutes following each CGP event. The minutes
     shall be posted on the AMC Corporate Governance milBook site within three duty days
     following the event.
     6.2. Meeting minutes will be formally staffed for approval. The minutes shall be drafted by
     the CGP Secretariat and distributed via TMT for coordination and approval at the appropriate
     level (e.g. CV shall approve the Council minutes). Once the minutes are approved, they
     shall be posted on the AMC Corporate Governance milBook site.

REVIEW/APPROVAL DOCUMENTATION: A5/8 is responsible for publishing minutes at
https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/amc-corporate-governance after coordinating and senior
leader approval in TMT following Group/Board/Council meetings. In order to ensure minimal
ambiguity since the decisions made by the Governance are sometimes regulatory in nature, the
minutes will, at a minimum, specially state whether the requirement is approved, disapproved or
approved with comment. If approved with comment, the minutes will detail the pertinent
comments. Additionally, if the requirement is a service acquisition requirement requiring RAD
approval in accordance with AFI 63-138, the minutes shall specifically state the RAD is also
approved/disapproved.

                          CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS REVIEW

A6.1. Background.
   A6.1.1. All new HQ-level contract requirements (i.e.             service, construction, and
   commodities/supply) greater than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold stated in Federal
   Acquisition Regulation 2.101 must be reviewed and approved through the AMC CGP. When
   exercising option year renewals, any proposed modification and/or task order that would
   result in work that was not validated and approved in the existing requirement approval
   documentation for the contract shall also be presented to the CGP for validation.
A6.2. Responsibilities.
   A6.2.1. All service acquisition requirements, as defined in AFI 63-138, require a
   Requirements Approval Document (RAD), formerly known as Service Acquisition
   Requirements Review (SARR), presented to and approved via the CGP.
       A6.2.1.1. Prior to presentation within the CGP, the requirement OPR will seek initial
       coordination from A1M to validate the requirement, IAW AFI 38-201. As part of this
       process, the OPR will also complete a manpower requirements validation form
       (attachment 4) and submit to AMC/A1MPP.
       A6.2.1.2. When contract performance is validated as an acceptable method to satisfy the
       requirement, the following documents must also be provided to AMC/A1M for review:
       draft/current Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Independent Government Cost
       Estimate (IGCE) to ensure the proposed contract work is not performed or funded by the
       existing in-service workforce.
       A6.2.1.3. The aforementioned process should occur two months in advance of proposed
       requirement start date when possible and prior to presentation to the CGP. Allow 10
       business days for A1M review.
   A6.2.2. The requirement OPR shall also first seek coordination from FM, Contracting and, if
   applicable, the Services Designated Official (SDO) and Services Advocate (SA) before
   presenting within the CGP. OPRs should provide all supporting documentation needed for a
   prudent initial requirement review.
   A6.2.3. The requirement OPR is responsible for ensuring this process is followed and built
   into the acquisition milestone schedule and ensuring all coordination is completed prior to
   entering the CGP.
   A6.2.4. Before proceeding with presentation to the Board and obtaining an approved RAD,
   the following conditions must be met:
       A6.2.4.1. The requirement OPR enters the CGP with a completed Contact Review Slide
       (Attachment 3).
       A6.2.4.2. All AFI required considerations shall be addressed at the CGP review IAW
       AFI 63-138 and local policy.
       A6.2.4.3. The requirements approval authority is present and approves the requirement
       through the CGP.
 18                                                         AMCI16-101 14 JANUARY 2014


   A6.2.5. The Group reviews service requirements and the Board/Council approves the service
   requirement as the delegated requirement approval authority.
      A6.2.5.1. The Group will also review existing requirements when their associated
      contract actions (i.e. modifications, option exercises, etc.) involve work that was not
      initially validated and approved during the requirements approval process prior to initial
      contract award.       The Board/Council will also approve these modified service
      requirements.
   A6.2.6. RAD approval is specifically documented in the meeting minutes and the record is
   maintained by the CGP Secretariat.
A6.3. Expectations and Delegations.
   A6.3.1. For requirements greater than or equal to the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and
   less than $500,000, unanimous Board approval is required to continue in the acquisition
   cycle.
   A6.3.2. For requirements greater than or equal to $500,000 or for requirements that do not
   have unanimous Board approval, the Board will submit a recommendation on the
   requirement to the Council.
   A6.3.3. The Council will provide final approval, approval with comment, or disapproval for
   all requirements greater than or equal to $500,000 and/or for all requirements that do not
   have unanimous Board approval; however, service acquisitions between $10M and $100M
   currently require separate RAD (formerly known as SARR) approval from the AMC/CC.
   A6.3.4. Any requirement may be pulled back or withdrawn by the OPR at any time during
   the process; however, any pulled requirement that is later resubmitted will need to go through
   the entire process, regardless of what stage it was in prior to being pulled.
A6.4. Annual Planning Task.
   A6.4.1. Once per year, ideally during the planning stages for the next fiscal year’s execution
   plan, A5/8 in conjunction with FM, will send a task to the Directorates asking for two data
   inputs. The first input is a summary of the previous year’s contract requirements and actions
   that were affected by Corporate Governance direction and/or decisions. The second input
   will be the upcoming fiscal year’s requirements. The primary purpose of the task is to
   review and approve future year requirements while keeping the results of the previous year’s
   Corporate Governance direction in mind. This also facilitates identifying potential
   candidates for cost saving consolidation and promotes crosstalk among the Directorates on
   savings ideas.

                 MOBILITY AIR FORCES (MAF) C2 MANAGEMENT

A7.1. Background.
   A7.1.1. The AMC Corporate Governance Process (CGP) will approve MAF C2 (further
   referred to as C2) requirements prioritization from the Command, Control, Communications,
   Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) R&PC; approve funding of C2 capabilities, systems,
   architectures, and roadmap; and approve any major changes to previously approved
   prioritization, funding, or architecture (see 4.0, C2 Mgmt Framework).
   A7.1.2. Management of C4I requirements are addressed in the C4I R&PC process. This
   attachment pertains to the C2 management framework.
A7.2. Responsibilities.
   A7.2.1. AMC/A3 will serve as the C2 Functional Area Manager to gather, articulate, and
   advocate for C2 requirements; develop and advocate for the prioritization of C2
   requirements; participate in the Capabilities Based Planning (CBP) process by chairing the
   C2 Functional Capabilities Team (FCT) along with 618 AOC (TACC), write the C2 CBP
   reports, write CONOPS and TTPs. A3 will also provide inputs on doctrine, vision, strategy,
   lessons learned, and all other non-materiel C2 related issues with MAF stakeholders.
   A7.2.2. AMC/A4 will gather, articulate, and advocate for logistics requirements and provide
   these requirements as participants of the CBP process.
   A7.2.3. AMC/A5/8 will orchestrate AMC’s requirements prioritization process and AMC
   CGP decision making process. A5/8 will also articulate funding requirements for AF
   Appropriated Funding (APF) via POM and Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
   Investment and Operations funding via USTRANSCOM CGP based on AMC’s approved
   prioritization list. A5/8 will lead the CBP process in partnership with A3 to determine
   materiel and non-materiel capability deficiencies. New C2 capabilities will be vetted through
   the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process and with CIO
   ensure IT acquisition and sustainment oversight as necessary to meet statutory requirements.
   A7.2.4. AMC/A6 will engineer, operate, maintain, sustain, and defend C2 capabilities based
   on the CIO-developed architecture and roadmap in coordination with A3. A6 will inform
   AMC CGP on status of C2 capabilities development and recommended changes as necessary
   for AMC approval.
   A7.2.5. CIO will provide guidance, direction, and oversight of all matters pertaining to the
   formulation, review, and execution of MAF IT plans, programs, and policies. CIO will
   develop and gain approval of technical C2/cyber architecture/roadmap as well as ensure
   integration of all MAF C2/cyber programs into approved architecture/roadmap.
   A7.2.6. AMC/A2 is the overall program manager for the AMC Intelligence Information
   Systems (IIS) enterprise and will gather, articulate, and advocate for all ISR C2 requirements
   and provide these requirements as participants of the CBP process.

   A7.2.7. All other Directorates will provide inputs into the C2 requirement process as
   necessary. Since all directorates have representatives on the C2 FCT, they will provide their
   requirements through the C2 FCT during the CBP process.
A7.3. Expectations and Delegations.
   A7.3.1. AMC/A5/8, in support of AMC's and USTRANSCOM's CGP, will appoint a Sub-
   Mission Area Manager (Sub- MAM) for Air Operations Planning and Execution (AOP&E)
   to support AMC information-related/IT decisions for both APF and TWCF funded
   requirements IAW USTCI 90-6.
   A7.3.2. AMC/A5/8 will serve as the AMC representative to USTRANSCOM's Oversight
   Council (TOC) to support and validate decisions made by the USTRANSCOM Mission Area
   Manager (MAM) and corporate process. The AOP&E Sub-MAM, with support from AMC
   C4I Requirements Working Group's (RWGs), will advocate for all APF and TWCF funded
   IT programs, and will provide a coordinated response for all TWCF funded programs to the
   USTRANSCOM MAM for final approval by the USTRANSCOM CGP IAW USTCI 90-6.
   A7.3.3. The Sub-MAM will provide a sufficient level of detail to support prioritization of
   resource decisions within AMC and the USTC CGP.
   A7.3.4. The appropriate acquisition authority will oversee C2 acquisition and sustainment
   programs. The acquisition authority may delegate program management oversight to the
   appropriate agency to meet the intent of DoDI 5000.02.
A7.4. Management of C2.

Figure A7.1. C2 Management Framework
AMCI16-101 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                   21


  A7.4.1. The C2 Management Framework is built on the principles in AF policy and
  guidance. The CBP process feeds the development of the C2 Core Function Master Plan
  integrated by A8X and approved by the CGP. A5/8 and A3 develops C2 Capabilities Based
  Assessment (CBA) initiating AMC’s requirements process.
  A7.4.2. The CBP process identifies the Command’s C2 capability deficiencies. Once
  identified, the deficiencies become validated requirements. Validated requirements are
  verified through the AMC CGP. A subject matter expert reviews the verified requirement to
  identify if the requirement can be serviced using the Doctrine, Organization, Training,
  Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) structure to
  determine if there is a non-materiel (DOTLPF) solution, materiel (M) solution, or a
  combination of the two. Requirements with anticipated non-materiel solutions are given to
  the appropriate staff for action.
  A7.4.3. A3 will analyze new requirements using the DOTMLPF structure to determine if it
  fits into the AMC C2 strategy. All requirements will then enter the C4I R&PC process.
  A7.4.4. The CIO will assess all requirements/proposed solutions to ensure alignment with
  AMC enterprise architecture and CIO roadmap, as well as ensure Clinger-Cohen Act
  compliance. The requirements/ proposed solutions will be assessed against the “as-is” and
  “to-be” enterprise architectures to determine process and technical touch-points and potential
  overlaps. The proposed technical implementation of the proposed solutions will be assessed
  against the CIO roadmap to ensure compatibility with the technical operating environment
  and ensure the most efficient and cost-effective means for integration. Additionally, an
  engineering review may be conducted to recommend the timing and nature of the
  implementation if multiple systems are affected by a given solution/proposed solution.
  A7.4.5. The C4I R&PC will prioritize C2 requirements for CGP approval IAW the AMC
  R&PC process. A5/8 oversees the R&PC process and reviews/approves the initial prioritized
  C2 requirement list at the C4I R&PC. The CGP will then develop and approve the final
  AMC 1-n prioritized list of requirements. A5/8, in coordination with all stakeholders, will
  seek solutions from AFRL, AFLCMC, USTC, industry, etc., and propose those solutions to
  the A3.
  A7.4.6. A5/8 and FM determine the funding sources (APF and/or TWCF). The CGP will
  approve the appropriate funding strategy. Split-funded or dual-funded requirements will be
  submitted to USTC’s CGP for approval. A5/8 is the lead for both APF and TWCF funding
  processes and reports to the CGP as required (AMC or USTC).
  A7.4.7. Once funding is approved/obtained, the C2 capability/system is assigned to the
  designated Program Manager (AFLCMC, TCAQ or AMC/A6) for execution.
  A7.4.8. A5/8, as the CGP Board Chair, will review MAF C2 programs at least annually to
  assess program cost, schedule, performance, and risk. A6, as CIO, will review all IT
  programs, including C2 programs, annually to assess technical compatibility with AMC IT
  enterprise architecture and ensure Clinger-Cohen Act compliance.
  A7.4.9. A5/8 is the AMC lead for all JCIDS documentation. The functional requirements
  manager will develop required documentation (e.g. ICD, CDD, CPD) and coordinate with
  A5Q throughout the acquisition lifecycle, including all new start programs.
