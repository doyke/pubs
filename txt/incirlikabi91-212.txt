1. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program Information.
     1.1. Situation. The Incirlik Air Base (IAB) BASH threat comes from a wide range of
     resident and migratory bird/wildlife species. These hazards reduce the effectiveness of the
     flying missions through loss of valuable assets, loss of manpower, and incurred repair costs.
     In addition, the presence of large numbers of birds/wildlife may result in the periodic
     termination of flying operations. This instruction establishes procedures to help minimize
     these hazards. No single solution exists for the BASH problem; however, through a
     combined cooperative effort of several organizations, employing a variety of techniques, we
     can reduce the impact the birds/wildlife have on our Wing, with our Tenant units (728 AMS,
     414 ERS) and Joint partners (10th Tanker Wing). This instruction is designed to:
        1.1.1. Establish roles and responsibilities of the personnel instrumental in implementing
        the instruction.
        1.1.2. Establish a Bird/Wildlife Hazard Working Group (BHWG) and designate
        responsibilities to its members.
        1.1.3. Establish procedures to identify high hazard situations.
        1.1.4. Provide guidance to supervisors and aircrews for declaring Bird Watch Conditions
        (BWC) or discontinuing flying operations when required.
        1.1.5. Maintain an effective partnership between 39 ABW and the 10th Tanker Wing.
        1.1.6. Provide guidance on the employment of bird/wildlife dispersal methods.
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                                3


     1.1.7. Establish aircraft and airfield operating procedures to avoid hazard situations.
     1.1.8. Provide guidance to all assigned and transient aircrews for disseminating
     information concerning bird/wildlife hazards and avoidance procedures.
     1.1.9. Provide guidance on proper employment of bird/wildlife dispersion techniques.
     1.1.10. Develop and improve techniques to decrease airfield attractiveness to birds
     /wildlife. NOTE: In the following paragraphs where a Supervisor of Flying (SOF) is
     referenced, it pertains to contingency operations requiring such a position. The 39 ABW
     does not have a permanently assigned USAF SOF and therefore is not applicable under
     normal operations.
  1.2. Airfield/Local Area.
     1.2.1. IAB is located in south-central Turkey, 8 miles east/northeast of the city of Adana.
     It is situated 30 miles south of the Taurus Mountains, 20 miles north of the Mediterranean
     Sea and lies in the middle of a vast agricultural area. The base encompasses
     approximately 3,200 acres and is generally flat with an average elevation of 206 feet.
     Built-up areas occur north and northwest of the base. The village of Incirlik lies south of
     the base and parallel to the runway. There are many types of vegetation on the airfield
     and in the surrounding area. Many trees have been planted on the airfield and were
     chosen for their natural unattractiveness to birds. Broad-leafed weed species cover much
     of the Incirlik airfield. The seeds, berries, fruits and foliage of these plants provide a
     major food source for the birds and invertebrates. When the grounds are mowed at 4
     inches or less, many types of birds are attracted to the areas of short cover. Invertebrates
     (insects, millipedes, and terrestrial snails) and frogs are on the field and are a popular
     source of food for many birds (including storks). Pavements are free of significant
     ponding; however, the airfield has depressions and poor drainage in many grassy areas
     which has the potential to attract wildlife during the rainy season. The base sewage
     ponds are south/southeast of the runway and do not attract many birds. There are four
     small ponds on the golf course and Adana lake is the nearest large fresh water area.
  1.3. Local Flying Area
     1.3.1. Konya Range is located 150 miles northwest of Incirlik and is situated 10 miles
     east of the city of Konya. The range is centered in a major winter roosting area for birds
     and is a primary stopover point for numerous migratory flocks moving between Africa
     and Europe. Seasonal wetlands and marshes surround the range and extend 30 miles to
     the south. Additionally, a network of irrigation canals in the area also attracts birds.
     Several large seasonal lakes (which normally dry up in the summer), located on the north
     and northwest borders of the range, are inhabited by brine shrimp and other invertebrates
     providing a major food source for all bird types.
     1.3.2. Training Areas: The major concern is aircraft flying at low altitude within the 50-
     mile circle. This area is an extensive agricultural area and a wintering area for many
     types of birds. It is also along the major migratory route between Africa and Europe.
     1.3.3. Low-Level Areas: The low-level routes over-fly a variety of terrain types that
     pose potential bird strike hazards.

     1.4. Request for waivers: Requests for waivers will be through the appropriate referenced
     AFI chain of command. For all local procedures contained within this instruction a request
     for waivers will be processed through command channels to the publication OPR for
     consideration.
2. Responsibilities
     2.1. 39ABW/CC (Commander)
        2.1.1. Reviews recommendations from BHWG for approval/disapproval.
     2.2. 39 ABW/CV (Vice Commander)
        2.2.1. Chairs the BHWG meeting and approves or disapproves recommendations from
        the group.
        2.2.2. Establishes, implements, and administers the Wing BASH program.
     2.3. 39 ABW/SE (Wing Safety Office) will:
        2.3.1. Ensure base wide compliance with this instruction.
        2.3.2. The Flight Safety NCO (FSNCO), or designated representative, is the secondary
        OPR for discerning conditions that could create a bird/wildlife strike hazard on the
        airfield, and will initiate dispersal or depredation (if authorized) action when necessary.
            2.3.2.1. Prevention (Primary Means). Environmental conditions observed in the
            runway vicinity that could attract birds/wildlife will be reported to 39 CES/CEC and
            39 OS/OSAB. (Examples of such areas include the following: routine surveillance
            and maintenance of all drainage culverts and ditches, standing water areas, recently
            mowed or neglected grass/vegetation areas, and suspected and confirmed roosting
            areas).
            2.3.2.2. Dispersal (Secondary Means). The FSNCO will coordinate with Tower and
            the SOF (if SOF is on duty), as required, before initiating any dispersal/depredation
            operations. Dispersal actions will be documented on the “BASH Response Action
            Log”, located in Attachment 4. Every effort will be made to prevent birds/wildlife
            from loitering inside the bird/wildlife exclusion zone (BEZ).
        2.3.3. The FSNCO will learn basic maintenance functions for the BASH cannon system
        in order to sustain full operational capability. Basic functions will include replacing
        empty propane tanks and simple troubleshooting/preventive maintenance.
        2.3.4. The FSNCO will perform quarterly preventive maintenance on all 20 cannons.
        Basic tools/equipment & supplies needed but not limited to are: multimeter,
        socket/ratchet set, 10mm combination wrench, 1-2 inch adjustable jaw wrench, suitable
        weather-resistant lubricant, rust resistant paint, rubber gloves, plastic garbage bag, safety
        glasses, ear defenders or plugs.
        2.3.5. Prepare the agenda for the quarterly BHWG.
        2.3.6. Provides the BHWG with the current bird/wildlife hazard reduction data received
        from Higher Headquarters, USAF BASH Team, and other agencies. Also, reports on
        BASH issues and proposes recommendations and actions to the BHWG.
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                               5


     2.3.7. Includes BHWG recommendations and action items in the base combined Airfield
     Operations Board meeting.
     2.3.8. Coordinates with aircrews, maintenance, airfield ops, etc. to insure a sample of the
     bird/wildlife remains are taken from the aircraft surfaces after a strike. For every
     bird/wildlife strike, send samples of the remains (if available) to the Smithsonian
     Institution’s Feather Identification Lab (SIFIL) for species identification and record the
     incident in AFSAS. For whole bird or partial carcass, pluck a variety of feathers from the
     head, breast, back, body, and tail if possible. Collect any/all blood, tissue, or fluid
     remains for DNA analysis. Identify bird or animal remains locally if expertise is
     available. Due to Avian Influenza presence in Europe, the United States Department of
     Agriculture (USDA) has prescribed pre-shipping treatment guidelines that must be
     followed. See Attachments 9, 10 and 11 for required documents prior to shipping.
     2.3.9. Compiles all bird/wildlife strike data (including Tenant and TURAF data),
     damaging and non-damaging, and inputs data into the Air Force Safety Automated
     System (AFSAS) database.
     2.3.10. Identifies trends and disseminates trend data and metrics to the BHWG, flying
     squadron FSOs, and Airfield Operations Board.
     2.3.11. Develop a capability for declaring, disseminating, and terminating BWC for IAB.
     TURAF is responsible for declaring and terminating BWC for their operations.
     2.3.12. Attends all pre-construction meetings and acceptance inspections affecting the
     airfield.
     2.3.13. Provides flying squadron FSOs with deployment BASH kits and instructions for
     use.
  2.4. 39 OS/CC (Operations Support Commander) will:
     2.4.1. Issue specific guidance for aircrews and the SOF on procedures, as applicable, to
     be followed under BWCs. Real time decisions should be based on operational necessity,
     the BWC, and location of bird/wildlife threat. BWC will be changed as a result of
     change in the bird/wildlife threat, not due to operational necessity.
     2.4.2. Coordinate on all requests for approval of new low altitude routes and areas. Each
     request will contain a statement confirming potential that bird strike hazards have been
     considered.
     2.4.3. Ensure bird/wildlife hazards are published in the FLIP, General Planning (GP)
     and IFR Supplement, along with the associated operating-hour restrictions and avoidance
     instructions.
     2.4.4. Issue specific guidance to pilot and maintenance personnel for reporting aircraft
     bird/wildlife strikes to the owning unit’s Quality Assurance (QA) section and 39
     ABW/SE.
  2.5. 39 OS/OSAB (Airfield Management) will:
     2.5.1. IAW Section 4.0 of this instruction, during normal flight operations, the authority
     to declare a BWC is AMOPS, Tower, or SOF (if SOF is on duty); all can raise or lower
     the BWC. During rotational deployments the SOF will be provided by the deployed unit.
6                                                     INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


    AMOPS will disseminate BWC information via landline to the following agencies:
    Tower, RAPCON, Command Post, 728 Air Mobility Control Center, Safety, Airfield
    Management Operations, TURAF, 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron, and
    the 39 EOG. Moderate and Severe BWC calls for immediate action by 24/7
    Bird/Wildlife Dispersal Team (BDT) consisting of AMOPS, Safety and if warranted, Pest
    Management.
    2.5.2. The Airfield Manager, or designated representative, is the OPR for discerning
    conditions that could create a bird/wildlife strike hazard on the airfield, and will initiate
    dispersal or depredation (if authorized) action when necessary, IAW section 4.0
    Operations of this instruction.
       2.5.2.1. AMOPS will conduct multiple bird sweeps on each shift to actively disrupt
       bird patterns on the airfield. Each time a bird sweep is conducted AMOPS will use a
       different type of mitigation technique, in order to keep the birds from becoming
       accustomed to one technique, and will log the event on the BASH Log. In addition,
       AMOPS will fill out the bird survey form each and provide to 39 ABW/SE for data
       tracking.
       2.5.2.2. Prevention (Primary Means). Environmental conditions observed in the
       runway vicinity that could attract birds/wildlife will be reported to 39 CES/CEC and
       39 ABW/SE. (Examples of such areas include the following: standing water areas,
       areas of recently mowed grass, and suspected or confirmed roosting areas).
           2.5.2.2.1. Grounds Maintenance. Airfield grass height will be maintained to a
           minimum of 7 inches and a maximum of 14 inches to discourage bird activity and
           habitat. The BHWG will establish and review airfield designated boundaries as
           required. During the rainy season, grass is allowed to exceed 14 inches in low-
           lying areas when the mowers create ruts on the airfield. If ponding or water is a
           continual problem after rain events and they don’t drain within 24-48 hours,
           consider regrading the area to improve drainage. At the end of the rainy season,
           grounds maintenance will reinstitute normal grass cutting procedures.
           2.5.2.2.2. Habitat modification. Meetings and conversations will continue with
           39 ABW/SE, AMOPS, Pest Management, and Grounds and Pavements to
           discourage activities that attract birds to the local area. These include, but are not
           limited to, seed crop planting in fields around approach and departure corridors,
           landfill operations, and industrial operations that create standing water. Items
           identified outside the confines of the AB will be presented to the 39ABW/SE and
           routed through the 39ABW/CC for coordination with the 10th Tanker Wing and
           local Leadership.
       2.5.2.3. Dispersal (Secondary Means).        The Airfield Manager or designated
       representative will coordinate with Tower and the SOF (if SOF is on duty); as
       required, before initiating any dispersal/depredation operations. Dispersal actions
       will be documented on the “BASH Response Action Log” (see Attachment 4), to
       include when, where, how many, and what type of birds/wildlife were dispersed, and
       follow-on actions taken. Every effort will be made to prevent birds/wildlife from
       loitering inside the BEZ.
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                               7


            2.5.2.3.1. Harassment. Available harassment techniques includes pyrotechnic
            equipment (bangers/screamers, 12-gauge airburst shells, BASH cannon system,
            etc.), bio-acoustic equipment, and any effective, safe, low-cost tools necessary for
            bird control (paintball gun, wood clapper, etc.). Personnel assigned for these
            duties will maintain proficiency on all devices used. See Attachment 2, Use of
            Pyrotechnics (Explosives) and Weapons (Shotgun).
            2.5.2.3.2. Depredation. Control through depredation is NOT authorized at this
            time. However, studies show that wildlife becomes accustomed to harassment
            techniques that are used over a period of time. In order to associate harassment
            techniques with mortality, at times it may become necessary to use depredation
            techniques to ensure harassment techniques remain effective. There is ongoing
            coordination with the 10th Tanker Wing to incorporate depredation techniques
            into maintaining an effective program. If depredation is allowed, all parties will
            be notified.
        2.5.2.4. Carry out these actions as required for implementation of bird watch
        procedures as outlined in Section 4.0 of this instruction.
     2.5.3. Advise aircrews in Airfield Operations of the BWC.
     2.5.4. Assist 39 ABW/SEF in conducting monthly bird/wildlife surveys for data
     collection and analysis.
        2.5.4.1. Bird/Wildlife Data Collection. Information gathered on birds/wildlife aids in
        minimizing future exposure within the airfield environment. Formal surveys that
        have consistent points on the airfield will help identify bird movement, foraging
        locations, and provides a good metric as to whether the BASH program efforts are
        effective. The following list is an example of data to be gathered.
            2.5.4.1.1. Peak concentration (number) by species of bird.
            2.5.4.1.2. Radar and visual sighting by time of day.
            2.5.4.1.3. Bird/Wildlife aircraft strikes (damaging or non-damaging) at IAB.
            2.5.4.1.4. Weather conditions during increased bird activity.
            2.5.4.1.5. Bird flying activity (soaring, transitioning, feeding, etc.).
            2.5.4.1.6. Types of control methods used and results of those methods.
     2.5.5. Investigates reports of bird concentrations on or near the airfield.
     2.5.6. Monitors environmental and bird nesting area control measures.

     problems to 39 ABW/SEF and 39 CES personnel.
     2.5.8. Maintains immediate reaction capability to disperse birds and allow downgrade of
     a Bird Watch Condition of SEVERE or MODERATE.
     2.5.9. Removes dead birds and animals from runway/taxiway areas and contacts 39
     ABW/SEF and 39 CES for remains identification and disposal. Also, report all wildlife
     remains, whether whole or in part, found on the airfield within 200 feet of a runway
8                                                      INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


       centerline. FSNCO will report in AFSAS as a bird strike, unless another reason for the
       animal’s death is identified. Ensure remains are sent to the SIFIL for identification IAW
       AFI 91-223, para 1.5.3.
       2.5.10. Requests non-Air Mobility Command transient aircrew submit the non-
       automated AF IMT 853, for the purpose of tracking bird activity. Non-AMC transient
       crews are not mandated to fill out the form and therefore may refuse.
       2.5.11. Coordinates with 39 ABW/SEF for any maintenance required for the BASH
       cannon system.
       2.5.12. Issue local Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) when the BWC is elevated to either
       MODERATE or SEVERE. Include time window for the elevated condition, if able, and
       reason (i.e., mowing operations, mitigation period, sunrise/sunset activity, etc.).
       2.5.13. Record unusual bird/wildlife activity, and aircraft bird/wildlife strike(s) by
       transient aircrews and report this information to 39 ABW/SEF.
       2.5.14. At the end of each week, send the completed BASH Log and the electronic
       BASH Cannon Log to 39 ABW/SEF.
       2.5.15. Provide monthly to 39 ABW/SEF information on when BWCs were declared,
       who declared them, and the reason for the declaration of the BWC (birds/wildlife on the
       infield, flocking birds crossing the runway centerline, etc.). This information does not
       need to be provided to 39 ABW/SEF if there is no BWC activity. This data will be used
       by 39 ABW/SE to determine the effectiveness of BASH measures.
       2.5.16. Ensure that the following are maintained in the Flight Information Publication
       (FLIP) system:

       2.6.4. Ensure unnecessary airfield lighting remains off, except as required for
       aircraft/maintenance operations.
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                                9


     2.6.5. Approach control will provide aircrews with reported bird activity outside the
     tower airspace when applicable IAW FAA Order 7110.65 and ICAO Doc 4444 (e.g.,
     aircrew reported bird activity on 10 mile final).
     2.6.6. OSAT will activate BASH cannon system (traffic permitting) as appropriate: for
     bird mitigation, at least once daily, or at the direction of AMOPS and/or Wing Safety.

     imposed as a result of bird activity.
     2.6.9. OSAT will determine, with the SOF and AMOPS, the need for employment of
     BASH cannons or other modes of bird dispersal.
     2.6.10. OSAR, Approach Control, observing large flocks of birds on radar which are
     confirmed by an airborne aircraft will forward this information to the tower, SOF (if
     applicable), and airfield management for appropriate dissemination.
     2.6.11. Coordinates with 39 ABW/SEF for any maintenance required for the BASH
     cannon system.
  2.7. 39 OS/OSK will:
     2.7.1. Review all proposed new low-level routes or changes to existing low-level routes
     for potential bird hazards.
     2.7.2. Monitor mission planning, as required, by providing bird activity to aircrews to
     ensure bird hazard information is properly considered before flight.

  2.9. 728 AMS and 414 ERS will:
     2.9.1. IAB is a unique location in which its airfield hosts transient cargo aircraft missions
     and reconnaissance missions. Although missions greatly differ, they rely on the same
     airfield and this mutual reliance requires a strong partnership to combat BASH issues and
     to implement an effective BASH program.
     2.9.2. Units will coordinate with 39 ABW/SEF to report all bird-aircraft strike(s), initiate
     AFSAS BASH reports, and the shipment of bird/animal remains.
     2.9.3. Reports all BASH events to 39 ABW/SEF that occur or are suspected to have
     occurred within 30 miles of the airfield. This data is significant in maintaining an
     accurate picture of local BASH activity.
     2.9.4. Issue procedures for the preservation of bird remains, when discovered on the
     aircraft, until Squadron or Wing Safety assumes responsibility IAW this instruction.
  2.10. 39 CES (Civil Engineering Squadron) will:
     2.10.1. Provide a representative to the Bird/wildlife Hazard Working Group to monitor
     and advise the group on environmental modification.

      Wing CC/CV.
3. Specific Bird/Wildlife Hazards
   3.1. The following is a summary of bird/wildlife strike hazards and recommendations for
   reducing each hazard to flight operations. Below is a brief description of each bird/wildlife
   and each method of control or avoidance for IAB and the Konya Range area.
      3.1.1. White Stork: Most of these species are attracted to the airfield due to their
      omnivorous eating habits. They don’t need water to feed. They will feed on all types of
      insects and small mammals. Control is best accomplished by eliminating the food
      sources. Periodically reinforce positive control measures with lethal control to maintain
      effectiveness of non-lethal measures. These storks present a major hazard and cause
      BASH Phase II procedures during the stork/hawk migratory seasons from 1 Mar-30
      Jun and 1 Oct-30 Nov.

Figure 1. White Stork




      3.1.2. Raptors (Hawks, Falcons, Kites, Eagles, and Buzzards): These birds can be
      particularly hazardous to aircraft because of their size and widespread distribution over
      bases and low-level areas. Raptors (particularly vultures) use thermals to their advantage
      to search for prey. These birds become active during mid morning and remain aloft until
      late afternoon. Avoid areas with thermal generating terrain such as ridgelines, rolling
      hills, and near water. Remove water as a thermal generating area (water actually absorbs
      heat). Landfills are particularly attractive to soaring vultures. In the fall, raptors migrate
      by day to areas of heavy winter concentrations. Removing dead animals on the airfield,
      proper management of landfills, rodent control on airfields, and removal of dead trees
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                                13


     and other perching sites on the airfield can control these birds. Use pyrotechnics to
     frighten raptors from the airfield. Contract out professionals to trap and relocate
     persistent raptors. As a last resort depredate. Note: If a raptor(s) are observed circling
     off the airfield yet in a zone dangerous to aircraft, then BDT personnel will investigate
     that location to see what the attraction is. Bring a TURAF representative along for
     relations/translation. Remove carcass if landowner approves.
     3.1.3. Anatidae “waterfowl” (Ducks, Geese, and Swans): A distinction must be made
     between resident and migrating populations. Resident waterfowl are attracted to an area
     to breed or feed. Ponds, lakes, ditches, etc., may attract these birds, particularly if these
     areas contain emergent or submerged vegetation for feeding, nesting, or shelter.
     Increasing the slope on the pond banks and removing vegetation will reduce waterfowl
     numbers. When possible, drain water sources after ensuring compliance with wetlands
     laws and regulations. Recently harvested grain fields are much more attractive than
     standing grain fields. Tower/Airfield Management must maintain vigilance during
     harvest and report large movements of birds. Pyrotechnics along with gas cannons are
     control techniques. Using live ammunition or opening base areas to waterfowl hunting
     are excellent methods of control. Resident birds are most active at dawn and dusk,
     moving at low altitudes to and from feeding areas. Avoid flying near wildlife refuges or
     any ponds, lakes, or rivers with known waterfowl concentrations during these times.
     Migrating waterfowl are particularly dangerous to flight safety due to the large numbers
     and generally higher altitude of the birds. Large flocks of waterfowl travel along
     traditional flyways to their breeding and wintering grounds during spring and fall. Huge
     flocks may stop along the route waiting for favorable weather conditions to continue.
     Migrating birds are most active from sunset through midnight, with numbers decreasing
     in the early morning hours. Avoid flying during the evening hours if possible. Wintering
     concentration areas should be avoided.
     3.1.4. Icteridae: (Blackbirds, Grackles, Cowbirds and Starlings): These birds can be
     particularly hazardous because they frequently occur in huge flocks, sometimes in the
     millions. Blackbirds and starlings are attracted to flat, open areas to feed, rest, or
     stage/pre-roost. Maintain grass height between 7 and 14 inches to best reduce airfield
     blackbird and starling numbers. Do not allow seed-producing plants to grow on the
     airfield nor out lease grain crops in areas where these birds are known to occur.
     Eliminate roost sites near the flight line. Selectively prune or remove roost trees, brush,
     or cattails if blackbirds and starlings are roosting on base. Blackbirds and starlings
     respond well to an intense frightening program using bioacoustics and pyrotechnics. Use
     other methods to supplement this program as necessary. Occasional shooting of birds
     will reinforce other frightening techniques (obtain permit). Consider poisoning or
     trapping (with a permit). Avoid at all costs flying near known blackbird and starling
     roosts, especially at sunrise and sunset and during spring and fall migration.
     3.1.5. Hirundinidae (Swallows and Martins): These birds eat insects in flight and are
     commonly found above airfields. Insect control will reduce swallow numbers and
     discouragement of nesting will further decrease numbers. Wash mud nests from eaves,
     culverts, etc., with a hose as the birds begin nesting. Harassing the birds as they work on
     building nests can discourage nesting in banks. If swallows are noted resting on runways
     or taxiways, use pyrotechnics to disperse them.
 14                                                    INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


      3.1.6. Corvidae: (Hooded crows, magpies, jays) a large family composed of the familiar
      crows and jays, plus close relatives like magpies, treepies, nutcrackers and choughs.
      They show quick intelligence and curiosity. They are the largest "songbirds" on earth.
      Use pyrotechnics to frighten birds from the airfield. As a last resort depredate
      3.1.7. Passeridae (Sparrows) These birds are common pests around structures. Sparrows
      often nest in hangars and dense shrubs and trees. Frightening techniques are usually
      ineffective against these birds. Wash mud nests from eaves, culverts, etc., with a hose as
      the birds begin nesting.
      3.1.8. Columbidae: (Pigeons and Doves)These birds are seed-eaters and are attracted to
      seed-producing weeds, grasses, and shrubs. Open areas or bare spots are attractive as
      resting or feeding sites. Pyrotechnics and other harassment can be effective in
      frightening these birds, however, it requires persistence due to their stubbornness to
      habitate in desired areas. Proper grass-height management, irrigation, and mowing
      before grass goes to seed will limit the number of pigeons and doves on the field.
      Pigeons frequently occur in structures such as hangars. Netting, shooting, trapping, and
      poison baiting can drastically reduce their numbers in these structures.
      3.1.9. Other Wildlife (Foxes, feral dogs/cats): These are common pests around the base
      and can flush birds into the path of aircraft. These predators should be removed from the
      active airfield. Removing the food source (small rodents, rabbits, etc.) from the airfield
      will help reduce these predators.
4. Operations
   4.1. Reporting Procedures: All personnel observing or discovering a bird/wildlife aircraft
   strike will notify Wing Safety and Command Post as soon as possible. This is required to
   ensure that evidence is preserved in order to identify the bird species involved. The only
   identification features that should be preserved are blood smears and remains (feathers, feet,
   or beaks). During non-duty hours, maintenance and Airfield Management Operations
   personnel will make arrangements for the preservation of evidence (use proper PPE before
   handling to protect against Avian Influenza) until Wing Safety assumes responsibility for it.
      4.2. Aircrews will report all known or suspected bird strikes to maintenance, or Airfield
      Management and ensure an AF IMT Form 853 is annotated. Aircrews may also be asked
      to complete an AF IMT Form 853 for an unknown strike in order for investigators to
      have a detailed record of flight.
   4.3. Bird Watch Condition: The goal of BWC is to eliminate the loss of resources due to
   BASH mishaps through a system of temporary restrictions and dispersion efforts. This
   dynamic system calls for providing the correct amount of protection to resources without
   stagnating flying operations.
      4.3.1. The following terminology will be used to alert tasked organizations of bird
      activity and implement control procedures. The terminology will also be included and
      updated as required in the IAB portion of the FLIP. NOTE: It is apparent that some
      subjectivity may be involved in declaring a BWC. Further, it cannot be overstressed that
      the use of numbers (5 to 15 large birds, etc.) is intended as a guide and a myriad of
      factors must be assessed when establishing a BWC. The declaring authority will utilize
      his/her expertise and best judgment to make the decision. If doubt exists as to the
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                              15


     severity of the hazard, the declaration will be made for the worst case. However, one
     bird airborne in the approach or departure corridor, or on the ground in the overrun areas
     can be grounds for a declaration of a SEVERE BWC.
         4.3.1.1. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE: Heavy concentrations of birds (more than
         10 large birds or 30 small birds) on or immediately above the active runway or in the
         approach/departure corridor or other specific location representing increased potential
         for strikes. Supervision and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before
         conducting operations in areas under condition SEVERE. Flight restrictions apply.
         4.3.1.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE: Concentrations of 5 to 10 large birds
         or 10 to 30 small birds near the active runway or in the approach/departure corridor or
         other specific location representing increased potential for strikes.            BWC
         MODERATE requires increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors and
         caution by aircrews. Flight restrictions apply.
         4.3.1.3. Bird Watch Condition LOW: Normal bird activity on and around the airfield
         representing low potential for strikes. No flight restrictions.
  4.4. BIRD WATCH CONDITION SEVERE PROCEDURES: During bird watch condition
  severe, flight operations are prohibited except in an emergency. Arriving aircraft will either
  hold awaiting a lower BWC, or will divert. Non-emergency landings in BWC SEVERE
  require risk acceptance approval by the 39 EOG/CC for the 414 ERS, or by 39 ABW/CC for
  all other landings IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
  4.5. BIRD WATCH CONDITION MODERATE PROCEDURES: During bird watch
  condition moderate, takeoffs and landings will only be allowed when departure and arrival
  routes will avoid bird activity. During BWC Phase II periods, aircraft will accomplish one
  approach to a full stop unless mission needs warrant additional approaches and sufficient fuel
  exists to divert if BWC changes to SEVERE.
  4.6. The BWC will typically be determined IAW the BWC Flowchart in Attachment 5 by
  AMOPS, however, Tower has the ability to raise the BWC if necessary. Wing Safety can
  recommend changes to the BWC, but AMOPS or Tower (or SOF when applicable) has final
  authority to set the BWC.
     4.6.1. Declaration of BWC should be based upon the following:
         4.6.1.1. Information relayed by airborne aircraft.
         4.6.1.2. Observations made by ground personnel on IAB.
         4.6.1.3. Observations made by ground personnel elsewhere (ranges, e.g., Konya
         Range). NOTE: Whenever bird/wildlife activity is increased, AMOPS must respond
         to the airfield. If a MODERATE or SEVERE call is made; they must actively work
         to reduce the BWC to LOW as quickly as possible.
     4.6.2. Upon receipt of new information showing a lessening bird/wildlife strike threat,
     the condition may be lowered. AMOPS will have the sole authority to downgrade the
     BWC.
     4.6.3. When on duty, the SOF will coordinate with the Control Tower and AMOPS to
     change the BWC. The SOF will ensure the appropriate BWC is declared for the
16                                                     INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


     bird/wildlife condition, regardless of other factors (such as pilot training requirements or
     mission-driven take-off times). If necessary, the SOF may waive specific BWC
     restrictions, as outlined in Flying Squadron Regulations, on a case-by-case basis; in any
     event, the SOF will log any deviations on the SOF Report.
     4.6.4. The appropriate BWC will be declared for specific areas (e.g., the airfield, Konya
     Range).
     4.6.5. All operations personnel should be alert for bird/wildlife activity and should report
     such activity immediately to their on-scene flight operations supervisor and the Airfield
     Manager, or through one of the following agencies:
         4.6.5.1. Supervisor of Flying
         4.6.5.2. Control Tower or AMOPS
         4.6.5.3. Wing Safety
         4.6.5.4. Range Control (e.g., the airfield, Konya Range)
  4.7. Communications: During normal flying periods, BWCs will be disseminated by the
  following means:
     4.7.1. AMOPS personnel will telephonically notify the following agencies of bird watch
     condition changes:
         4.7.1.1. 39 ABW Command Post
         4.7.1.2. Control Tower/SOF
         4.7.1.3. Wing Safety
         4.7.1.4. 728 Air Mobility Control Center
         4.7.1.5. TURAF
         4.7.1.6. All other U.S. military flying units operating at IAB.
     4.7.2. The primary means of transmitting the BWC on Incirlik AB to airborne aircraft
     will be through the ATIS. Under BWCs SEVERE and MODERATE, 39 OS/OSAT and
     OSAR will advise the pilot upon initial contact of the BWC.
  4.8. Aircrew responsibilities and procedures: If while in flight, an aircrew observes or
  encounters any bird activity that would constitute a hazard to flight, the aircrew should
  contact the SOF, Control Tower, or Range Control and request that the observed bird activity
  is passed to the appropriate agencies. The following information should be included:
     4.8.1. Call Sign
     4.8.2. Location
     4.8.3. Altitude
     4.8.4. Local time sighting
     4.8.5. Approximate number of birds
     4.8.6. Type of bird (if known)
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                            17


  4.9. Procedures for SOF: If a bird activity report is received from an airborne aircraft, or
  other source, notify the following agencies:
     4.9.1. Control Tower
     4.9.2. AMOPS
     4.9.3. Command post
  4.10. Procedures for 39 ABW/CP: If a bird/wildlife activity report is received from an
  airborne aircraft, or other source, notify the following agencies:
     4.10.1. Airfield Management Operations
     4.10.2. Supervisor of Flying
     4.10.3. Control Tower
     4.10.4. Wing Safety
     4.10.5. 728 Air Mobility Control Center
     4.10.6. 414 ERS
     4.10.7. All other U.S. military flying units operating at Incirlik Air Base.
  4.11. Downgrading the BWC: Upon receipt of new information showing a lessening
  bird/wildlife strike threat, the condition may be lowered. Coordination between AMOPS, the
  Control Tower and the SOF (while on duty) will be conducted in order to downgrade the
  BWC.
  4.12. BASH PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2:
     4.12.1. BASH Phase 1: Denotes bird activity on and around the airfield and represents a
     low potential for strikes.
     4.12.2. BASH Phase 2: Incirlik Air Base is in BASH Phase 2 operations from 1 March -
     30 June and from 1 October - 30 November due to stork and raptor migratory patterns.
     During all other months, the airfield is in BASH Phase 1.
     4.12.3. BASH Phase 2 is listed in the European IFR Supplement as follows:
         BASH: phase II stork/raptor migratory season 1 Mar-30 Jun and 1 Oct-
         30 Nov up to 2000 ft AGL, Phase I all other periods. Small bird activity
         30 May-30 Sep may cause BWC upgrade.
  4.13. Flight Restrictions. The following flight restrictions for airfield operations will be
  imposed during BWC MODERATE or SEVERE.
     4.13.1. MODERATE: Requires increased vigilance by all agencies and extra caution by
     aircrews.
         4.13.1.1. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when departure and arrival
         routes avoid identified bird activity.
     4.13.2. SEVERE:       Requires total vigilance by all agencies and extreme caution by
     aircrews.
18                                                   INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


         4.13.2.1. Flight operations are prohibited except in an emergency. Non-emergency
         landings in BWC SEVERE require risk acceptance approval by the 39 EOG/CC for
         the 414 ERS, or by 39 ABW/CC for all other landings IAW AFI 11-202V3, General
         Flight Rules.
  4.14. Bird/Wildlife Hazard Working Group (BHWG)
     4.14.1. Function: Collects, compiles, and reviews data on bird strikes IAW AFI 91-204.
     Identifies hazards and recommends changes in operational procedures to reduce these
     hazards. Prepares informational programs for aircrews and serves as a point of contact
     for off-base BASH issues. The BHWG is a forum to discuss all issues related to BASH,
     to include, but not limited to construction, airfield habitat, habitat off-airfield but on
     installation, etc.
     4.14.2. Authority: The BHWG is established IAW AFI 91-202 and AFMAN 91-212
     and chaired by the 39 ABW/CV. The BHWG submits all recommendations to the 39
     ABW/CC for approval.
     4.14.3. Composition: The chairman will be the 39 ABW Vice Commander. As a
     minimum, the group will consist of representatives from, 39 ABW/SEF, 39 OS/OSA, 39
     OS/OSAB, 39 OS/OSAT, 39 CES and the 728 Air Mobility Squadron. Representatives
     from the Turkish Air Force, 39th Expeditionary Operations Group, and other U.S.
     military flying units operating at Incirlik will be invited to attend.
     4.14.4. Meeting Schedule: The BHWG will, as a minimum, meet quarterly or when
     requested by the chairman.
     4.14.5. Minutes: Meeting minutes agenda are integrated into the Air Operations Board
     minutes and signed by the chairman. Once signed, the minutes will be disseminated to
     the BHWG membership.
  4.15. Bird/Wildlife Exclusion Zone (BEZ): Includes the area of IAB bounded on the south
  by A Street, the north by a fence on the south side of G-H-I Loops, and on the east and west
  by Perimeter Road.
     4.15.1. The concept is to keep bird/wildlife activity within the BEZ to the minimum
     possible. Supervisors and aircrews will be notified and will take appropriate action,
     when warranted, according to this instruction.
     4.15.2. Bird/wildlife activity outside the BEZ will be monitored by AMOPS and
     FSNCO. Action will be taken, according to this instruction, when warranted.
  4.16. The Bird/wildlife Reduction Zone (BRZ): Located outside the BEZ and bounded by
  Perimeter Road. This area excludes all housing areas, munitions storage areas, areas
  otherwise prohibited to bird/wildlife harassment operations, and the BEZ.
     4.16.1. The concept is to keep bird/wildlife activity within the BRZ to the minimum
     possible when bird/wildlife harassment resources are available once birds/wildlife have
     been cleared out of the BEZ.
     4.16.2. Tasks: Section 2.0 outlines the general and continuing tasks and responsibilities
     for each organization. Section 3.0 lists specific tasks to counter hazards that are
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                               19


     discovered and will remain in effect only until the hazard is removed or reduced
     sufficiently as determined by the seasonal nature of the hazard or by the BHWG.
  4.17. Bird nest knockdown procedures: Outlines procedures for the observation and knock
  down of swallow bird nests on buildings along the airfield, by 39 CES personnel to reduce
  bird activity on IAB airfield.
     4.17.1. Operations
         4.17.1.1. The overall monitor for the implementation of this plan is 39 CES.
         4.17.1.2. The BEZ includes the area of IAB bounded on the south by A Street, the
         north by a line parallel to the northern side of Golf, Hotel & India Loops, and on the
         east and west by the perimeter road (see map on page D-2 in 39th Wing Plan 91-212).
         4.17.1.3. One method to keep the bird activity of swallows lower in the BEZ is
         through a conscientious bird nest knock down program.
     4.17.2. Procedures for 39 ABW/SEF
         4.17.2.1. Monitor activities of all tasked agencies for compliance with this
         instruction.
         4.17.2.2. Incorporate changes to this instruction as deemed necessary.
         4.17.2.3. Identify buildings requiring nest knock down.
     4.17.3. Procedures for 39 CES
     4.17.3.1. Provide the necessary personnel to accomplish the tasking in this instruction,
     for the tasked period.
         4.17.3.2. Develop a schedule to ensure the buildings listed are checked for bird nests
         twice weekly, and knocked down when nests are observed.
         4.17.3.3. Provide the necessary equipment to accomplish the work as outlined in this
         plan.
     4.17.4. Personnel work schedule and equipment requirements.
         4.17.4.1. Personnel will be supplied by 39 CES and trained on the PPE and
         equipment necessary to accomplish the knock downs.
         4.17.4.2. Knock Down Teams (KDT) will consist of a minimum of two personnel.
         One person will be used to operate the vehicle and the other will perform the knock
         downs.
         4.17.4.3. The KDTs shall be available to perform knock down activities as required.
         4.17.4.4. The KDTs will utilize a rotation schedule for the buildings listed in
         paragraph 4.17.5.1. of this instruction, by starting at one end of the flight line and
         continuing to the other.
         4.17.4.5. The intent of this program is to continually displace and harass the birds, so
         they move to new nesting locations further away from the flight line.
20                                                     INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


         4.17.4.6. The KDTs shall use a vehicle & lift platform that is capable of safely
         reaching the eaves of the facilities, and allows an individual to reach and knock down
         the bird nests safely.
         4.17.4.7. The technique used to knock down the nests is up to the 39 CES, as long as
         the entire nest is removed from the facility.
     4.17.5. Procedures for Pest Control Contractor
         4.17.5.1. Contractor shall perform twice a week inspections and bird nest knock
         downs as needed on the following buildings: 281, 282, 412, 310, 318, 326, 332, 334,
         338, 344, 345, 346, 350, 354, 360, 370, 500, 510, 515, 518, 520, 525, 526, 564, 626,
         627, 628 and 630. Contractor shall provide documentation to contract monitor and
         Wing Safety upon request, indicating buildings inspected and nests knocked down.
         When notified of bird nests and potential problems, the contractor shall respond
         within 24 hours of notification.
         4.17.5.2. Contractor shall perform twice a week inspections and bird nest
         knockdowns as needed in all aircraft shelters and facilities in Golf-Hotel-India and
         Victor Loops. The contractor shall provide documentation of these inspections to the
         contract monitor and Wing Safety upon request, indicating building inspected and
         nests knocked down. When notified of bird nests and potential problems the
         contractor shall respond within 24 hours of notification.
         4.17.5.3. Contractor shall perform inspections and bird nest knockdowns as needed
         on a monthly basis for the following facilities in the 2020 and 2300 areas. Included
         in the 2020 are facilities 2000-2018. Facilities in the 2300 area include 2382, 2384,
         2386, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2394, 2396, 2398, and 2400. The contractor shall provide
         documentation to contract monitor and Wing Safety upon request indicating buildings
         inspected and nests knocked down.
         4.17.5.4. The contractor shall perform inspections and bird nest knockdowns as
         needed on a monthly basis for the following facilities: 2112, 2114 and 2115.
         4.17.5.5. The contractor shall perform preventive inspections prior to, or beginning
         of Spring and as required during Summer to remove bird nests or spray for wasp
         habitation in and around the BASH cannon assemblies.
  4.18. Dispersal Methods: There must be a concerted & persistent effort between several
  agencies using a proactive approach to bird/wildlife control in order to successfully execute
  an effective BASH plan. Dispersal methods without prior coordination can threaten air
  traffic as birds will take flight in unpredictable directions; therefore, it is imperative that
  dispersal methods be employed only with the consent of the 39 OS/OSAT, OSAB, and SOF
  (when applicable).
     4.18.1. Airfield attractiveness: The first step in controlling airfield wildlife is to make
     the airfield as inhospitable as possible. This can effectively be done by maintaining the
     prescribed grass height, removal of dead vegetation, monitoring and leveling of low lying
     areas, and proper drainage. In addition, monthly inspections of the fence line for means
     of entry by fox or other large animals will aid in preventing animals on the airfield.
INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014                                                                    21


       4.18.2. Liquid propane gas (LPG) cannons with accompanying bioacoustics (BASH
       cannon system): The system in use by the 39 ABW is a series of 20 state-of-the-art M-8
       model cannons, some of which are equipped with bioacoustics. The remote-enabled
       system is a proven, convenient, and expedient means of dispersing birds. The system is
       most useful when operated randomly, as birds can be conditioned to accept routine
       scheduled employment. This system will be fired at least once a day during any Tower
       shift at random times. AMOPS will collect the electronic BASH Log and forward to 39
       ABW/SEF once a week for tracking purposes. In addition, AMOPS has the capability of
       using a portable LPG cannon to accommodate new areas of congregation and nesting.
       The portable cannon will be fired at least twice a week and tracked on the BASH Log.
       Limited depredation will decrease habituation and reinforce the effects of the cannons.
       However, at this time, the Host Nation does not allow depredation at IAB.
       4.18.3. Pyrotechnics, bangers, and screamers: These bird dispersion techniques are
       advantageous in their portability but due to explosive hazards must be maintained IAW
       AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards. In addition, documented annual training
       must be accomplished. See Attachment 2 for pyrotechnic actions and procedures.
       NOTE: It is imperative that coordination is completed with Airfield Management and
       Security Forces before implementing this option of dispersal. Limited depredation will
       decrease habituation and reinforce the effects of pyrotechnics. However, at this time, the
       Host Nation does not allow depredation at IAB.
       4.18.4. Vehicle harassment & mobile bioacoustics: Vehicle harassment consists of using
       a vehicle to chase, herd, or scare birds/wildlife by means of the vehicle or its lights, horn,
       siren or bioacoustics system. Those activating the vehicle-mounted bioacoustics system
       should be aware of which bird selection of the system is most effective against a targeted
       species. This is an effective technique, which can save time and reduce operating costs,
       such as those associated with pyrotechnic use. It works especially well for birds roosting
       or loafing on paved areas or where pyrotechnic use would be hazardous. However, this
       technique may not be as effective in dispersing certain species of wildlife and may be
       more short-term than other methods. Care will be exercised when chasing wildlife “off-
       road” with a vehicle, due to the potential danger of hidden obstacles in tall grass and
       uneven terrain.
Caution: Some species may initially be attracted to distress calls (some birds will flock to the
distress to chase predator away). Using distress calls in conjunction with pyrotechnics can be
very effective. If birds come into the distress call, send a pyrotechnic up into the flock to
disperse.
       4.18.5. Paintball guns: Paintball guns have been proven to be an effective alternative
       means to disperse flocks of birds. Paintball guns will use non-explosive, water soluble
       paintballs, and will be marked with red so Security Forces can distinguish it from a
22                                                   INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


     weapon. It is not necessary to use paintballs, situation dependent, as the compressed air
     sound may be sufficient enough to disperse the birds. The goal is to shoot paintballs in
     the vicinity of the birds to disperse them, not to shoot the birds. NOTE: It is imperative
     that coordination is completed with Airfield Management and Security Forces before
     implementing this option of dispersal.
     4.18.6. Depredation: Depredation is NOT authorized at this time.

      Forces is required prior to the start of depredation.
      (2). Pyrotechnics are noise-producing devices, effective in bird dispersal. Only     39
      MXS/MXMC approved scare cartridges are authorized to be fired from the 12-gauge shotgun or
      banger/screamer launcher.
      (3). The live rounds and/or pyrotechnics used are hazard class/division 1.4 explosives; which
      could result in a potential moderate fire hazard. When not in use, munitions will be stored in the
      GSA approved gun safe located in the Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) office.
      (4). Unauthorized personnel will not be permitted to handle live rounds and/or pyrotechnics.
      (5). Always wear eye protection (safety glasses, military issued eyewear), hearing protection (ear
      plugs and/or ear defenders), and reflective vest when operating the shotgun or launcher with live
      rounds and/or pyrotechnics.
      (6). The shotgun or launcher will not be loaded or fired while in any building or vehicle.
      (7). The shotgun or launcher will not be pointed (loaded/unloaded) at any individual, building,
      vehicle, or aircraft for any reason. The shotgun or launcher will always be handled with care and
      treated as if it were loaded at all times.
      (8). Smoking is prohibited when handling/using the shotgun or launcher and pyrotechnic
      munitions.
      (9). A pre-task safety briefing will be provided to any personnel accompanying the supervisor,

       trigger guard until you are absolutely sure of your target and have a clear range of fire.
       (5). Hold the shotgun at a 45-degree angle (pointed to the desired area) and fire.
       (6). Pull straight back on the pump in a rapid fashion; the cartridge should eject automatically.
8. UNLOADING PROCEDURES FOR SHOTGUN
   a. To remove an unfired cartridge, depress the slide release button, located on the right side of the
   trigger guard.
   b. Firmly grasp the pump, pull the pump straight back in a rapid manner, the cartridge should eject
   automatically.
   c. Turn the safety on by depressing the button located underneath and to the rear of the trigger guard.
   It should move to the right. The red painted ring around its circumference should no longer be
   visible. CAUTION: The safety is a mechanical device and should not be relied upon to prevent an
   accidental discharge. Always keep your fingers clear of the trigger guard until ready to fire.
9. MISFIRE PROCEDURES FOR SHOTGUN
  a. Ensure the shotgun is pointed away from personnel and equipment.
  b. Lay down the shotgun at least 50 feet away from personnel and equipment for at least 15 minutes
  before reloading.
  c. Point shotgun down and away from body. Remove the misfired cartridge.
  d. Place the cartridge in a container separate from remaining pyrotechnics.
  e. If there is a dent in the primer but not expended, contact EOD at 676-6910
10. LOADING AND FIRING PROCEDURES FOR 15MM PISTOL LAUNCHER
  a. Only personnel that have been properly trained on the 15mm pistol are authorized to disperse
     using this method.
      (1) Pull the pistol launcher’s hammer back to the cocked position.
      (2) Place the .22 caliber cap in the angled chamber and secure it in place with the small spring
          clip.
      (3) To prevent an accidental discharge, pull the hammer back to the cocked position, and place

 28                                                           INCIRLIKABI91-212 28 APRIL 2014


            the fuse end (banger) in the pistol. Check that the pyrotechnic fits loosely into the muzzle end.
            If you have to apply force to insert the pyrotechnic, remove it and clean the muzzle.
            Otherwise, the pyrotechnic may become lodged and explode in the muzzle.
        (5) Hold the pistol away from the body at a 45-degree angle, and fire in the direction of the birds.
            Screamers and bangers travel 30-60 yards.
11. DISPOSAL PROCEDURES FOR EXPENDED CARTRIDGES
    a. All fired cartridges generated from expenditure of live rounds and/or pyrotechnics will be retrieved
    for turn-in to AMOPS
12. DISPERSAL OPERATION PROCEDURES
    a. Notify Tower and Security Forces prior to use of live rounds and/or pyrotechnics.
    b. Place the shotgun into the vehicle, muzzle first, with the slide racked back. Ensure the chamber is
    open and the safety is on. CAUTION: The safety is a mechanical device and should not be relied
    upon to prevent an accidental discharge. Always keep your fingers clear of the trigger guard until
    ready to fire.
    c. Plan the approach and vehicle placement carefully. Ideally, the vehicle should be within 200 feet
    of the birds. Fire the pyrotechnics to explode between the runway and the birds to disperse them from
    the movement area. Several shots may be needed to achieve desired results.
    d. Do not discharge the shotgun with aircraft in the landing pattern or awaiting takeoff, without
    coordination with the Tower. A primary concern is to keep the birds away from aircraft and prevent a
    bird strike.

       SUPERVISOR OF FLYING (SOF) BIRD/WILDLIFE ACTIVITY/HAZARD
                              CHECKLIST

1. Notify 39 OS/CC when time permits.
2. Designate BWC IAW with Bird Watch Condition Flowchart. The restrictions on operations
relating to each BWC applies to all USAF aircraft operating at Incirlik AB.
   a. BWC MODERATE
      (1) Low-Levels - Minimum altitude 1,000' Above Ground Level (AGL) on affected route
      segment(s).
      (2) On Ranges - Flight leads will change events as required to avoid bird activity.
      Minimum altitude is 1,000' AGL.
   c. BWC SEVERE
      (1) Low-Levels/Ranges - Low-level routes reported as bird condition severe (by pilots)
      are canceled for the day. Range use is restricted to above 3,000 feet AGL until the
      SOF/Range Control Officer (RCO) determines the severe bird hazard no longer exists.
3. If birds are observed and considered a hazard to the flying operation notify Airfield
Management and FSNCO. Airfield Management personnel will update condition and initiate
bird dispersal operations if necessary.
4. Request the tower controllers broadcast the new BWC, as appropriate.
5. If conditions warrant, consider holding departures, directing full stops, or straight in
approaches only.
6. As the bird hazard decreases, do not hesitate to downgrade the BWC.
7. Notify the 39 OS/CC of actions taken.
NOTE: A BWC moderate or severe at Incirlik AB does not mean that all the ranges are BWC
moderate or severe. That also applies to low-levels. Flight leads should use caution on the
ranges or low-levels and pass the word to the SOF, if conditions warrant a raising or lowering of
the particular bird condition. The SOF/RCO can pass on to pilots that certain areas are
considered BWC moderate or severe due to pilot reports (e.g., Konya Range is BWC moderate).

                AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS CHECKLIST

1. Coordinate with the SOF for bird/wildlife dispersal. If the SOF is not on duty, coordinate
with Ground Control for cannon activation and FSNCO for mobile dispersal actions.


2. Disperse birds by these means in order:


   a. Sirens/horns/bioacoustics


   b. BASH Cannon


   c. Shotgun or launcher using pyrotechnics


   d. Depredation as a tool to reinforce non-lethal controls and last resort


3. When birds/wildlife have left, inform Ground Control that harassment is complete. The SOF,
if on duty, will decrease the BWC to the appropriate level. If no SOF is on duty, AMOPS will
decrease BWC.


4. Remain in the area for 5-10 minutes to ensure birds/wildlife do not return.


Instructions for BASH cannon


1. When using BASH cannons members will follow the manufacturer’s guidance.
