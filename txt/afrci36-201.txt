OPR: HQ AFRC/DPCS (Ms. Emma B. Harrison)              Certified by: HQ AFRC/DP (Mr. Steve L. Mann)
Supersedes AFRCI36-201, 21 January 2000                                                  Pages: 11
                                                                                    Distribution: F

This instruction implements AFRCPD 36-2, Retention Policy for Air Reserve Technician (ART) Officers.
It provides the responsibilities and procedures for administering extension beyond the normal military
mandatory separation dates (MSDs) for ART officers according to Title 10, U.S.C., Section 14702(a),
whether under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System
(FERS). The responsibilities and procedures outlined herein apply to all ART officers, organizations to
which ART officers are assigned, and to their servicing military personnel flight (MPF) and civilian per-
sonnel flight (CPF).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This supplement is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision deletes the
option for FERS ART officers to extend to age 55 with 25 years of service as identified in former para-
graphs 1.2.3., 2.2., Attachment 1 para 2, Attachment 2 para 1j and 2b. It also clarifies when individuals
may request MSD extensions and adds the requirement for submission of justification for case-by-case
extensions (paragraphs 2.3. and 2.5.). Paragraph 3.1.1. is added to clarify that the termination of MSD
extension is appropriate for medically disqualified ART officers. Paragraph 5.1.3. is added to clarify
MSD extensions should be requested to avoid registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP)
prior to non extended MSD. Paragraph 6.8.5. deletes the expiration of 12 month PPP registration as an
option to effect civilian separation. Paragraph 6.9.1. has been reworded to clarify the ART officer’s
responsibility to provide documentation to extend or decline to extend MSD. All references to AFRES
have been changed to AFRC. All references to HQ AFRC/DPCC have been changed to HQ AFRC/DPCS
throughout the publication. All references to his or her have been deleted.


1. Civil Service Retirement Milestones: Retirement eligibility following MSD separation is generally
based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules for discontinued service retirement (DSR); i.e.,
involuntary separation and age 50 with 20 years of creditable service or any age with 25 years of credit-
2                                                                AFRCI36-201 30 DECEMBER 2005


able service. AFRC’s MSD extension policies ensure that if applicable service deposits are made, the
CSRS ART officer should be eligible for an unreduced annuity and the FERS ART officer should be eli-
gible for immediate receipt of the annuity supplement. In order to obtain a civilian annuity, the ART
officer must be able to attain five years of FERS or CSRS covered federal civilian service. See paragraph
1.2.1. for specific age and service requirements. (NOTE: Only OPM is authorized to approve or disap-
prove retirement applications.)
    1.1. CSRS: CSRS ART officers may request MSD extension to age 55 with 20 years of potentially
    creditable service. When the CSRS DSR retiree separates before the age of 55, OPM regulations
    require an annuity reduction of 2 percent for each year under age 55. This reduction is a permanent
    reduction. Extending to age 55 ensures that the ART officer's annuity will not be reduced due to age.
    If the CSRS ART chooses not to request a MSD extension, the ART may be eligible for DSR (50/20,
    or any age/25), but the annuity will be reduced if the ART is under age 55.
    1.2. FERS: ART officers under FERS may request MSD extension to their minimum retirement age
    (MRA) with 20 years of potentially creditable service (MRA/20), (see paragraph 2.2.). ARTs retiring
    with entitlement to a DSR annuity (50/20, or any age/25) are eligible for an immediate, unreduced
    annuity but will not be able to receive the annuity supplement until they reach their MRA.
       1.2.1. The MRA is a sliding age (age 55 to 57) which is based on year of birth as follows:
       Before 1948, 55 years
           1.2.1.1. 1948, 55 years and 2 months
           1.2.1.2. 1949, 55 years and 4 months
           1.2.1.3. 1950, 55 years and 6 months
           1.2.1.4. 1951, 55 years and 8 months
           1.2.1.5. 1952, 55 years and 10 months
           1.2.1.6. 1953 through 1964, 56 years
           1.2.1.7. 1965, 56 years and 2 months
           1.2.1.8. 1966, 56 years and 4 months
           1.2.1.9. 1967, 56 years and 6 months
           1.2.1.10. 1968, 56 years and 8 months
           1.2.1.11. 1969, 56 years and 10 months
           1.2.1.12. 1970 and after, 57 years
       1.2.2. If the ART chooses not to request an extension of MSD, the ART may be eligible for DSR
       (50/20, or any age/25), but receipt of the annuity supplement is delayed if MRA has not been
       reached.
       1.2.3. Optional reduced retirement. FERS employees are eligible to retire at their MRA with as
       little as 10 years of creditable service (MRA/10). Annuities are reduced 5 percent for each year the
       employee is under age 62. The reduction is a permanent reduction. FERS ART officers who do not
       complete military deposits prior to MSD separation may only be eligible for this reduced annuity.
AFRCI36-201 30 DECEMBER 2005                                                                                3


2. Requests for MSD Extension:
   2.1. Under CSRS, AFRC will consider requests for MSD extension beyond age 55, but not to exceed
   age 60, only in cases when the individual does not have enough creditable years of service to retire
   with an immediate annuity but could obtain 20 years before reaching age 60. An exception is
   described in paragraph 2.5.
   2.2. Under FERS, individuals may request MSD extension to MRA (55-57) with 20 years of poten-
   tially creditable service (MRA/20), thereby meeting the eligibility for an annuity supplement. Those
   under FERS who cannot attain 20 years creditable service before reaching age 60 may request MSD
   extension to MRA/10 provided they could attain 10 years creditable service by age 60.
   2.3. Generally, individuals may request an extension after achieving 25 years of Total Federal Com-
   missioned Service (TFCS). When warranted, extensions may be requested earlier. (For example,
   when individual is within two years of original MSD, but has not achieved 25 years of TFCS).
      2.3.1. (Added) ARTs may request MSD extension upon permanent assignment to GS-15 ART
      officer position.
      2.3.2. (Added) Individual may request extensions not to exceed the normal policy date in accor-
      dance with paragraphs 1.1. or 1.2. in no more than two increments (that is, annually, biennially,
      etc.). The requested extension will be of sufficient duration so as to permit 1 year’s registration in
      the Department of Defense (DoD) Priority Placement Program (PPP). (See para. 5.1.)
      2.3.3. (Added) ART officers may submit a request for extension up to 60 days before MSD, as
      long as there is no adverse impact on an individual already selected for the position.
   2.4. AFRC will not approve extension requests for those who are subject to separation for reasons
   within their control as outlined in AFRCI 36-114, Procedures on Air Reserve Technicians (ART) Who
   Lose Active Membership in the Reserve.
      2.4.1. (Added) ART officers assigned to 0-5 (or below) authorizations who pin on O-6 are volun-
      tarily providing a basis for AFRC to disapprove a request to extend their MSD.
   2.5. Case-by-Case Extensions. The AFRC Commander (CC) or Vice Commander (CV) may make
   individual case-by-case extensions based on the needs of AFRC. Such requests should include suffi-
   cient justification outlining the need for the unique skill of the individual and the inability to recruit/
   retain qualified personnel.
      2.5.1. (Added) Due to recruitment problems, retention problems, needs of AFRC, critical nature
      of the positions, etc., the AFRC/CC or CV may, as contingencies of the service dictate, identify
      certain ART officer occupations or groups of positions and consider requests for extension of
      occupants of such positions to age 60, regardless of the number of years of creditable civil service
      required or possessed by the individual. AFRC normally announces such occupation/group excep-
      tions by e-mail/memo and rescinds when needs of the command are met.
   2.6. Prior Military Service Credibility. Many ART officers have prior military service that is poten-
   tially creditable toward retirement eligibility, but can only be officially credited when the employee
   makes required deposits to the civilian retirement system (that is, all employees covered by FERS and
   those employees first covered by CSRS on or after 1 Oct 82). For these officers, AFRC policy is to
   consider approving MSD extension only to the appropriate dates using all potentially creditable mili-
   tary service.

    2.7. Extended Active Duty (EAD). ART officers may request MSD extension upon official selection
    for EAD if within 5 years of their MSD. If the ART officer fails to return to the ART program, AFRC
    adjusts the extended MSD to coincide with the later of the normal MSD or the date they separate from
    the military tour. Within one year of the MSD, HQ AFRC/DPCS registers the ART officer on EAD in
    the DoD PPP in keeping with the provisions of this instruction. To the extent possible, AFRC treats
    ART officers on EAD the same as ART officers not on tour.

3. Termination of MSD Extension:
    3.1. With the AFRC Vice Commander’s written approval, commanders may terminate an extension
    (with employee being subject to separation as an ART officer) if the individual engages in miscon-
    duct, substandard performance, etc., provided the commander properly documents the reserve record
    and follows due process. The individual will receive written notice of the proposed termination of the
    extension and be provided an opportunity to respond in writing prior to a final decision being made.
       3.1.1. (Added) Termination of MSD extension is appropriate for ART officers who have been
       determined medically disqualified through no fault of their own.
    3.2. AFRC will not consider voluntary requests for termination of approved extension except in
    extraordinary situations. [NOTE: Requests to curtail an extended MSD follow the same procedures
    used in requesting the MSD extension. In addition, ART officers should provide written justification
    for the request and include the following statement: “If AFRC approves my request to terminate an
    extended MSD, I hereby voluntarily waive my eligibility for one full year’s registration in the DoD
    Priority Placement Program (PPP).”]

4. Adjusted MSD Extension:
    4.1. For individuals with extended MSD who subsequently leave the ART program for any reason
    (except for active military service) before reaching their extended MSD, AFRC will adjust their MSD
    to coincide with the later of their normal MSD or the date of such voluntary separation from the ART
    position. The notification to ARPC will be done by the MPF, HQ AFRC/DPO (Colonels/Colonel
    Selects), or other appropriate office depending upon the applicable grade of the ART officer and the
    reasons for the adjustment. (NOTE: Those on EAD may retain their extended MSD only as long as
    they have restoration rights to an ART officer position.)

5. Conditions of Employment with MSD Extension:
    5.1. One year before MSD, HQ AFRC/DPCS registers individuals in the DoD PPP for non-ART posi-
    tions within the Air Force. If no offer is received, individuals face separation procedures upon reach-
    ing their MSD, whether in a key or non-key position.
       5.1.1. (Added) ART officers must ensure they are registered by HQ AFRC/DPCS in the DoD PPP
       to avail themselves of AFRC’s intent to provide them with a one-year registration period prior to
       their separation. Failure to be registered one year prior to a member’s MSD will not extend the
       date of separation. Each member may register beyond the local commuting area and for
       lower-graded jobs in accordance with the DoD PPP procedures. If a member registers for and
       accepts an offer to a lower-graded position, pay retention is NOT authorized.
AFRCI36-201 30 DECEMBER 2005                                                                          5


      5.1.2. (Added) Individuals declining a PPP offer of a position for which registered will be
      removed from the PPP. Individuals declining a PPP offer of a position within their commuting
      area for which registered may be denied DSR by OPM.
      5.1.3. (Added) To avoid premature registration in DoD PPP one year prior to non extended MSD,
      ART officers who plan to remain in the ART program should request extension at least 24 months
      prior to original MSD. (Coincides with MPF notification, see para. 6.7.1.)
   5.2. An individual with an extended MSD continues to be subject to mobility. Normally, AFRC will
   not require a management directed permanent change of station (PCS) move unless the individual has
   at least one-year retainability.
   5.3. Individuals with an extended MSD continue to be eligible for military and civilian promotion.
   However, accepting military promotion to colonel (O-6) when it exceeds the military grade authorized
   for the ART position of assignment is considered “within the individual’s control.” When this occurs,
   the individual is subject to separation from the civilian position (see AFRCI 36-114).

6. Responsibilities and Procedures:
   6.1. AFRC/CC or the Secretary of the Air Force (as appropriate). Approves or disapproves requests
   for MSD extension for general officers.
   6.2. AFRC/CV. Approves or disapproves requests for MSD extension beyond the normal policy date
   for O-6 (colonels) and below. Approves or disapproves member requested reviews of NAF/CC and
   HQ Directors disapprovals for MSD extensions beyond the normal policy date.
   6.3. NAF/CCs and HQs Directors. Approve or disapprove requests for MSD extension to the normal
   policy date. Recommends approval or disapproval for MSD extensions beyond the normal policy
   date.
   6.4. HQ AFRC/DP:
      6.4.1. Develops and maintains procedures to process requests for MSD extension.
      6.4.2. Serves as the headquarters office of primary responsibility (OPR) for processing requests
      through command level channels.
   6.5. HQ AFRC/DPCS. Registers all ART officers in DoD PPP one year prior to MSD.
   6.6. Wing, Group, and Detached Squadron Commander:
      6.6.1. Reviews and recommends approval or disapproval on individual requests for extension to
      MSD. Ensures Reserve unit personnel record group and other performance and conduct records
      support recommendation for approval or disapproval.
      6.6.2. Provides comments to support recommended action and forwards to the next higher level.
   6.7. Servicing MPF:
      6.7.1. Twenty-four months before the ART officer’s MSD, prepares Memorandum of Option to
      Request for Extension of MSD (Attachment 1) to the ART officers who require an extension in
      order to qualify for the milestones in paragraph 1.1. (CSRS) or paragraph 1.2. (FERS). The
      employee must return the memorandum to the MPF with an annotation/endorsement either elect-
      ing to request an extension or choosing not to extend.
6                                                                 AFRCI36-201 30 DECEMBER 2005


       6.7.2. Informs (for example, via e-mail) the servicing CPF who verifies the service computation
       date (SCD) required from the individual’s civilian personnel files.
       6.7.3. Provides an information copy of the notification/election letter to the servicing CPF.
       6.7.4. Files one copy of the notification letter in the individual’s field personnel record group.
       6.7.5. Reviews requests for extension from individual ART officers to ensure the requests meet
       procedure and documentation requirements.
       6.7.6. Obtains reserve brief “SURF” (BAD002) and attaches to the request.
       6.7.7. Provides completed requests to the unit commander for processing through channels (to
       HQ AFRC/DPCS). Includes any disciplinary/adverse information maintained in military record
       group.
       6.7.8. Provides completed, signed copy of employee’s request for MSD extension (that is, signed
       copy of Memorandum of Request for Extension of MSD (Attachment 2), and AFRC Form
       121, Air Reserve Technician (ART) Program Certificate of Understanding), to the servicing
       CPF for filing (or forwarding to AFPC for filing) in official personnel folder (OPF).
       6.7.9. Sixty days prior to MSD (usually when processing ART officer’s application for reserve
       retirement) MPF notifies CPF that MSD is within 60 days. (This helps ensure CPF prepares and
       coordinates timely proposed separation notice with proper offices, to include HQ AFRC/DPCE.)
       6.7.10. Provides copy of approved or disapproved MSD extension to the ART officer.
       6.7.11. If an ART leaves during “extended MSD,” notifies ARPC/DPPS, who will adjust MSD

       6.8.3. File (or forward to AFPC for filing) completed and signed copy of employee’s request for
       MSD extension (that is, signed copy of Attachment 2 and AFRC Form 121) in the OPF.
       6.8.4. Ensure proposed separation notice is completed and delivered to ART officer at least 30
       days (preferably 60 to 90 days) before the MSD, and complete any necessary follow-up action.
       Copies of all notices must be coordinated with HQ AFRC/DPCE according to the AFRC Supple-
       ment to AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
       6.8.5. If not placed earlier, effect separation from civilian portion of ART position on the later of
       the MSD or the 30-day notice period. (NOTE: AFRC policy is that ART officers are separated on
       their MSD. For example, extensions until the end of the pay period or end of month are not per-
       missible.)
       6.8.6. File (or forward to AFPC for filing) appropriate documents in employee’s OPF.
    6.9. ART Officers:
AFRCI36-201 30 DECEMBER 2005                                                                        7

SUBJECT: Option to Request Extension of Mandatory Separation Date (MSD)


1. Your personnel records indicate that you will reach your military MSD on ______________ at which
time you will be ______ years old and will have ______ years of potentially creditable service for civilian
retirement. The two civilian retirement programs are the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and
the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Under existing civil service regulations, (a) if eligible
for discontinued service retirement (DSR) your annuity would be reduced because you are under age 55
(CSRS), or (b) if eligible for DSR you may not be entitled to the annuity supplement (FERS) due to being
less than your minimum retirement age (MRA) (e.g., 55-57 years old), or (c) you will not be entitled to an
optional reduced retirement (MRA/10) with 5 percent reduction for each year under age 62 (FERS).
2. According to the provisions of AFRCI 36-201, you may request an extension of your MSD to (a) 55/
20 (CSRS), (b) MRA/20 (FERS), or (c) MRA/10 (FERS), as long as you can attain the appropriate years
of service before age 60. Additionally, your military performance and conduct must justify continuation
in a duty status.
3. If you desire to apply for extension of your MSD, complete the attached request, sign, and return it to
the MPF no later than ______________.
4. If you do not desire to apply for extension of your MSD, complete paragraph 3 of the attached request
by entering your initials in the block, signing the memorandum, and returning it to the MPF no later than
______________.
