SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised: numerous items have been added.

 3.11.5.1. (Added). The unit security managers (USM) are responsible for updating JPAS to
reflect the date the interim clearance was granted by the unit commander. The USM will maintain
a copy of the interim clearance authorization letter and forward a copy with the AF Form 2583 to
the installation personnel security manager, 354 SFS/S5PS.
5.1.1.2. (Added). Commanders, staff agency chiefs, and unit security managers must ensure
packages are received by 354 SFS/S5PS within 30 days of the date annotated in Block 12 of the

manager will annotate the personnel security investigation request date in the remarks section
prior to returning the AF Form 2583 to the requesting unit.

5.2.1.2. (Added). The Chief, Security Forces will designate, by letter, persons to authenticate
forms requesting personnel security investigations.     Chief, Security Forces will keep
HQ PACAF/A7S0 advised of the name, SSN, grade, DEROS, and duty phone number of those
personnel designated as authorized requestors.

7.1.2.2.1. (Added). All unit commanders will document the security access requirement/ position
coding (SAR/PC) reviews annually and forward results in a memorandum for 354 SFS/S5PS. All
SAR code changes must be routed through 354 SFS/S5PS.

7.5.1. (Added). The Unit Security Manager (USM) will use JPAS to verify unit personnel have
signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), SF312 Classified Information Non-disclosure
Agreement and mail them to the applicable address listed in AFI31-401, Para 5.5 of the
Information Security Management Program. The USMs are responsible for ensuring NDA
information is entered in JPAS before an interim clearance and access to classified information is
granted.

8.2.1.4.1. (Added). When a security information file (SIF) is established by the Air Force Central
Adjudication Facility (AFCAF), all access to classified information will be removed to include
metropolitan area network (MAN) access and unescorted entry privileges. The USM will notify
the 354 SFS/S5PS in writing or via email when the individual’s access to all classified, MAN
access and unescorted privileges have been removed. The USM has the option to keep the
individual’s AF Form 1199 until the SIF is removed or turn it into Pass & Registration. If the
USM keeps the AF Form 1199, as a minimum it must be stored in a locked file cabinet.

8.2.2.6.1. (Added). When an individual, who is the subject of a SIF, receives an assignment
notification, the USM will notify the 354 SFS/S5PS 90-days prior to the individual’s
reassignment.

8.2.2.7.1. (Added). The installation personnel security manager will send a completed AF Form
74, Communications Status Notice/Request, with each SIF, by First Class mail, to ensure the file
has been received.

8.2.3.1. (Added). The USMs will provide 354 SFS/S5PS with applicable letters and forms listed
in the Security Manager’s Handbook for establishment of SIFs.

A2.7.1.1. (Added). All USMs must have a joint clearance and access verifications system
(JCAVS) report and a JCAVS periodic reinvestigation report current for each calendar month.
The USMs will ensure all periodic reinvestigations (PRs) are suspensed to the individual.
