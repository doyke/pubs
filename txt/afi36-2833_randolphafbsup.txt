This publication implements and extends the guidance in AFI 36-2833, Safety Awards, 20
September 2006. This publication applies to units subordinate to the 12 FTW. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Units are
to submit nomination packages via electronic Staff Summary Sheets (e-SSS) (paragraph
2.2.4.1.1.); changes to timeline for submitting Well Done Awards (Section AQ)(Added) in
accordance with 19th AF/AETC requirements.

2.1.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) Use of 12 FTW Safety website. To download sample
nomination packages go to the 12 FTW Safety website on the AF portal at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/afp40/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?command=org&pageId=681742&channelPageId=-1605853
follow the links to “Awards” or call 652-2224 for assistance.

2.1.2.   (Added-Randolph AFB)          Although personnel in tenant organizations draw
administrative support from the 12 MSS, they are not subordinate to the 12 FTW. They must
submit safety award nominations through their own chain of command. 12FTW/SE is available
to provide general guidance, although mission partners may have unique requirements in their
own specific chains of command.

2.1.3. (Added-Randolph AFB) The intent of this supplement is to keep the format of
submissions for 12 FTW awards as close as possible to that required for the AETC and AF-level
awards they parallel.
2                                      AFI36-2833_RANDOLPHAFBSUP                   10 MAY 2007

2.2.4.1.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) Responsibility for the proper formatting of awards
nomination packages rests with the nominating squadron commander or equivalent (see the 12
FTW/SE website for an example or call 652-2224). Submit nomination packages electronically
via e-SSS. The routing of the award package begins with the Squadron Commander or
equivalent through the staff of the Group Commander/MX Directorate (in accordance with the
group’s/directorate’s staffing procedures) to the Group Commander/MX Director (Coord), to 12
FTW/SE. Email to flight.safety@randolph.af.mil. 12 FTW/SE will print the appropriate
documents and staff the award package to 12 FTW/CC for approval. Attach the following files
to the email:

2.2.4.1.1.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) Tab 1: Letter(s) for 12 FTW/CC signature. If
nominating for an AETC-level award, include a nomination letter for 12 FTW/CC signature (see
12 FTW Safety web page for an example). If nominating for a 12 FTW-level award, include a
recommended congratulatory letter for 12 FTW/CC signature (see 12 FTW Safety web page for
an example). If nominating for the 12 FTW Well Done Award, 12 FTW/SE will add the full-
color award certificate(s) when the package is received.

2.2.4.1.1.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) Tab 2: Nomination narrative. Follow the direction of the
basic AFI, paragraph 2.2.4.2, and the AETC supplement. Use the most current AF IMT 1206, no
more than one single-spaced page in Bullet format.

2.2.4.1.1.3. (Added-Randolph AFB) Tab 3: Condensed narrative in citation format. Follow
the format identified in the AETC Sup 1. NOTE: A citation is no longer required for the Well
Done Awards.

2.2.4.1.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) Groups/Directorate must provide quarterly award packages
to 12 FTW/SE by 2 Jan, 1 Apr, 1 Jul, or 1 Oct, or by the last normal duty day prior to these dates
if they fall on a weekend/holiday/down day.

2.2.4.4. (Added-Randolph AFB) Annual safety award nominations are due to 12 FTW/SE not
later than 01 Oct, or by the last normal duty day prior if a weekend/holiday/down day.

Section AQ. (Added-Randolph AFB) 12 FTW Well Done Award.

189. (Added-Randolph AFB) This is an event-driven award. Examples of events on which
such awards have been based in the past include exceptional handling of an in-flight emergency
(IFE) by a flight crew, exceptional work by a crew chief launching an aircraft, and exceptional
work by a maintenance team repairing an aircraft. Units may nominate their people for both the
12 FTW and AETC levels of this award with a single staff package. Alternatively, they may
choose to nominate for only the 12 FTW level award. In the event a nomination package does
not meet eligibility suspense date, the highest level award may default to wing level. Reference
AETC Sup 1 for more complete information on purpose, award description, and eligibility. This
information applies to both the 12 FTW Well Done Award and to the AETC Well Done Award.
IAW NAF guidance, the award package is due to 19th AF/SEF 10 days after the end of the
quarter. For this reason, Groups/Directorate must have award packages to 12 FTW/SE NLT 5
days after the last day of the quarter. Group/Directorate CCs will set a suspense for their
subordinate organizations that ensures adequate time for staffing (absent other guidance from the
AFI36-2833_RANDOLPHAFBSUP              10 MAY 2007                                            3

Group Commander/MX Director, units should submit packages to the staff of the Group
Commander/MX Director NLT 30 days prior to the end of the quarter if timing permits,
otherwise ASAP if event occurs during last month/days of the quarter). Safety award programs
are an extremely valuable means for commanders to recognize exceptional contributions by unit
personnel. Therefore, it is incumbent upon commanders to ensure the timely submission and
processing of the highest quality award packages. The nominating unit commander should
assign an action officer (AO) responsible for the start-to-finish processing of all safety award
packages. The AO will be the primary person responsible for ensuring the electronic awards
package meets the prescribed suspense to 12 FTW/SE. Active, engaged follow-through by the
AO every step of the way will ensure unit award nominees’ interests are best served. Prompt
processing of changes, if required, to award packages by the AO/unit personnel will similarly
contribute to the high caliber of package necessary to successfully compete at the wing and
higher headquarters level.

Section AR. (Added-Randolph AFB) 12 FTW Flight Safety Award of Distinction.

190. (Added-Randolph AFB) This is a quarterly wing-level award. Reference AETC Sup 1 for
purpose, award description, and eligibility. Strong consideration should be given to an
individual or team that has made an exceptional flight safety process improvement.
Additionally, in the past, some squadrons have nominated their most outstanding Well Done
Award nominee from the quarter in question for the Flight Safety Award of Distinction. This is
perfectly acceptable, and should require only minor reworking of the original Well Done
nomination package. NOTE: A Group/Directorate may submit only one package per quarter.

Section AS. (Added-Randolph AFB) 12 FTW Ground Safety Individual Award of
Distinction.

191. (Added-Randolph AFB) This is a quarterly wing-level award. Reference AETC Sup 1 for
purpose, award description, and eligibility. The individuals typically nominated for this award
have been unit ground safety program managers. NOTE: A Group/Directorate may submit only
one package per quarter.

Section AT. (Added-Randolph AFB) 12 FTW Weapons Safety Individual Award of
Distinction.

192. (Added-Randolph AFB) This is a quarterly wing-level award. Reference AETC Sup 1 for
purpose, award description, and eligibility. The individuals typically nominated for this award
have been unit weapons safety program managers. NOTE: A Group/Directorate may submit
only one package per quarter.
