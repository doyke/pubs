     1.1.3. HQ AETC/A2OI develops IFTU policy, manages IFTU operations, and provides
     student management oversight.
     1.1.4. LEAD MAJCOM will ensure instructor manning levels are adequate to accommodate
     normal operations such as instructor leave, deployments and any other issue that may arise
     IAW AFI 14-202 Vol1 para. 1.3.2.3.
1.2. Training Syllabus.
     1.2.1. A syllabus is the directive for executing each formal training course of the IFTU. The
     syllabus is developed by the IFTU with oversight by the training MAJCOM and SME
     support as required from the lead MAJCOM. AETCI 36-2221, Flying Training Course and
     Special Publications Development contain specific syllabus development requirements.
     1.2.2. Refer to AFI 14-2 MDS and lead MAJCOM for more Additional Training (AT)
     guidance.
1.3. Course Training Standards (CTS). Graduates must meet all syllabus-directed CTSs at
the required proficiency level.
1.4. Waivers. The syllabus is directive and must be followed precisely, unless a waiver is
approved. Syllabus waivers and prerequisite waivers will be routed thru HQ AETC/A2O to HQ
AETC/A3Z for approval. Deviations will not be authorized without written approval.
1.5. Additional Training (AT). All additional training events will be reported on AF Form
4293 Student Activity Record. Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized AT and specific
guidelines.
1.6. Student Scheduling.

     when the emergency is confirmed by the Red Cross or home unit leadership. The IFTU Chief
     (Course Director) will record student absences on a memorandum for record filed with the
     student’s training record. Student leave approval rests with the IFTU chain-of-command and
     is a based on the individual circumstance surrounding the request.
     1.6.3. Since the length of IFTU courses vary, the IFTU Chief (Course Director) along with
     input from course staff, will determine if the IFTU student departing on emergency leave will

   complete the course and be granted the AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training or if they will
   be withdrawn and re-entered into training at another date.
1.7. Field Trips. Field trips and/or site visits must be listed in the syllabus and
approved/directed by lead MAJCOM. Double billeting requirements for overnight trips will be
specified in the syllabus and additional guidance will be listed on the course description of the
Education          and         Training         Course          Announcements            (ETCA)

                                            Chapter 2

                                   STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Course Entry Administration. Student’s MAJCOM Formal Training Manager will
review incoming student records to verify they have met all course entry prerequisites before
enrolling student in the course. If a student does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact
HQ AETC/A2OI before entering the student into training. The waiver authority for the
prerequisites is the AETC Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO).
2.2. Class Quotas. HQ AETC/A2OI provides yearly class quotas and notifies affected
MAJCOMS of quota changes.
2.3. Quota Management. HQ AETC/A2OI establishes the baseline for student quota
management and maintains the quota management worksheets, which reflect real-time changes
and are the AETC intelligence training primary source documents for class entry, student load,
and production schedule information.
     2.3.1. Class Entry Rosters.
        2.3.1.1. IFTUs will obtain class entry rosters in Military Personnel Data System-Oracle
        Training Administration (MilPDS/OTA) not later than 2 weeks before class start date.
        Rosters should be obtained as early as possible to allow identification of excess capacity.
        2.3.1.2. IFTU units will report roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, but no
        later than 3 academic days following the class start date. Report changes, no shows,
        discrepancies, and graduation delays to HQ AETC/A2OI/ISR Operations.
2.4. Performance Standards.
     2.4.1. Academic Examinations. The minimum passing score for IFTU academic
     examinations is 85 percent or as documented in the AETC approved syllabus. Only an
     instructor qualified in the academic section being taught will administer examinations.
     During examinations, instructors only answer questions to clarify the meaning of questions.
     Instructors should avoid answering in a manner that changes students’ confidence in an
     answer or directs a path for problem resolution. Anything said to one student should be
     shared with the entire class. Instructor test review will ensure all missed questions are
     clarified and corrected.
     2.4.2. Task Evaluations. The standard for task evaluation is Q (Qualified). The standards for
     achieving a Q will be made available to each student. A grade of Q- (Qualified with
     discrepancies) may require AT as determined by the Intelligence Evaluator (IE). A grade of
     U (Unqualified) will require AT, and re-evaluation of the task.
        2.4.2.1. Task evaluations must be conducted and documented by a certified Intelligence
        Evaluator (IE) using AF Form 4349 Record of Intelligence Evaluation, AF Form 4350,
        Certificate of Intelligence Qualification; AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, or
        locally produced gradesheet. The IE will provide feedback to every student immediately
        following their task evaluation.
AETCI36-2205V15 3 APRIL 2014                                                                 7


     2.4.2.2. A repeated task evaluation does not automatically generate a grade of U. The IE
     and/or Course Director may decide if a student needs to repeat a task before a final grade
     for that task is determined.
  2.4.3. Below-standard Performance. A test score below 85 percent or a U (Unqualified) task
  evaluation score will generate AT and corrective action.

                                            Chapter 3

                                  STUDENT MANAGEMENT

3.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP).
     3.1.1. Objective. The objective of CAP is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s
     progress in training, specific deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may
     also be used to monitor personal or disciplinary issues requiring supervisory attention.
     3.1.2. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
        3.1.2.1. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance (test failure).
        Units may use additional local procedures to monitor students who demonstrate marginal
        academic performance (example: an academic average less than 90%). See paragraph
        3.1.3 below.
        3.1.2.2. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
        3.1.2.3. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
     3.1.3. Operations Group Commander Responsibilities. The OG/CC administers CAP. Once a
     student begins training, the OG/OGI (or OSS/IN) administers the program. Note: CAP
     administration may be delegated to the Deputy OG, OSS/CC, SIO, Course Director, or IFTU
     Chief; but the OG/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.
     3.1.4. CAP Procedures. The IFTU Chief or SIO places the student on CAP. Due to the short
     duration of the course, once a student enters CAP they will remain in that status until
     graduation or course removal.
        3.1.4.1. Generate an AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary, for any student
        placed in CAP for non-progression of an academic test, skill evaluation, or for an
        officership or airmanship problem. AETC Form 101 is a permanent part of the student’s
        training record.
        3.1.4.2. While the student is in CAP, tailor training to address the student’s particular
        situation within the limits of the syllabus. Create a corrective training plan on a locally
        produced MFR or AF IMT Form 4293, Student Activity Record. Contractor-provided
        training is conducted IAW the training contract. The IFTU Chief closely monitors
        instructor continuity and ensures proficiency standards are not being compromised to
        permit CAP students to progress in training.
        3.1.4.3. The IFTU Chief or designated representative counsels the student when placed
        in CAP. Initial counseling covers CAP objectives, student training plan, and instructor
        continuity. Additional counseling is done at the discretion of the IFTU Chief or
        designated representative, but is required if the student fails to meet the CAP removal
        goals. Document all counseling in the student’s training folder.
        3.1.4.4. The IFTU Chief or SIO updates group leadership weekly on the student’s
        progress. As a minimum, this update includes the student’s strong and weak areas and
        additional training (AT) details.
AETCI36-2205V15 3 APRIL 2014                                                                    9


3.2. Progress Checks (PCs) and Elimination Checks (ECs). PCs and ECs are key events in
the Commanders Review (CR) process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable
syllabus.
3.3. Commander’s Review (CR) Process.
   3.3.1. Overview. The CR process recommends the student’s elimination or retention in
   training. It must be completed within 2 duty days from the date the initiating authority (IA)
   signs the AETC Form 146, Record of Commander’s Review Action (IFTU).

      medical condition that renders him or her incapable of meeting training requirements for
      IFTU training. Students that are hospitalized for an extended period may be washed back
      to the next class (when available) or considered for reinstatement at a later date. Due to
      the temporary duty status of IFTU students, the determination to eliminate must be
      completed within 1 duty day. If the flight surgeon or appropriate medical authority
      determines the disqualification may resolve within another 1 duty day forward the request
      to HQ AETC/A2OI and the student’s home unit to determine if elimination or course
      continuation (including wash back) is warranted.
      3.5.2.8. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
      obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the student’s
      fitness for training.
   3.5.3. OG/CC acts as the authority to determine if an officer should be eliminated from
   IFTU training for misconduct which results in, or warrants, non-judicial punishment. Based
   on the totality of the circumstances, the respective subordinate commander recommends
AETCI36-2205V15 3 APRIL 2014                                                                 11


   whether an officer should be eliminated from training. When the misconduct is serious
   enough to warrant discharge from service under AFI 363206, Administrative Discharge
   Procedures for Commissioned Officers, and the responsible AETC Show-Cause Authority
   initiates discharge action. Otherwise, AETC A/2/3/10 makes recommendation to HQ AFPC
   concerning reclassification and discharge of these officers.
3.6. Student Dispositions.
   3.6.1. IFTU students eliminated from their respective courses are returned to their home unit
   (or gaining unit in the case of training conducted during a PCS move).

                              STUDENT TRAINING FOLDER

6.1. Introduction. Training and personal information folders contain confidential information
about the progress of each student and must be maintained accordingly. The IFTU Chief and
staff instructors maintain the folders on a daily basis. A backup version may be maintained at the
unit’s discretion. Specify procedures in local unit guidance. Students may only access their
specific student training folder.
6.2. Contents.
   6.2.1. Personal information. Personal information must be maintained separately from the
   actual training folder. Units may use Personal Information Files, or Class/Flight Commander
   books to keep personal/sensitive information separate from specific training information.
   This information must be secured to prevent inadvertent or deliberate access by unauthorized
   personnel. Examples of personal information to be maintained separate from training folders
   are:
       6.2.1.1. Adopted Forms.
   6.2.2. Training folders. Training folders contain information specific to the student’s training
   history and performance. The student training folder will contain:
       6.2.2.1. Prescribed Forms.
6.3. Documentation. Document student training issues on AF Form 4293. Instructors provide a
concise summary of the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin
each entry with date of the event, subject or syllabus lesson numbers, overall lesson grade, and
lesson duration (if applicable). End the entry with the signature, printed name, grade, and duty
title of the instructor making the entry. The student, the student’s assigned instructor, and the
IFTU Chief or IN Flight/CC initials all AF Form 4293 entries. Make an AF Form 4293 entry for
the following:
   6.3.1. Failure of any academic test, PC, or EC.
   6.3.2. Counseling sessions concerning training progress. Note: If the counseling involves
   sensitive personal problems, document the session on AF Form 174 and keep the form in the
   student’s personal information folders. Annotate on an AF Form 4293 in the student’s
   training folder that a counseling session was conducted.
   6.3.3. Assignment in CAP.
   6.3.4. Removal from or reinstatement into training.
   6.3.5. Syllabus deviations or training waivers.
   6.3.6. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
   6.3.7. Lessons graded overall unsatisfactory (U). Use the cause and effect format to
   document substandard performance and identify the root cause for all individual items graded
   as substandard.
AETCI36-2205V15 3 APRIL 2014                                                                   15


6.4. Student Training Records Disposition. The IFTU Chief will forward original student
training records to the home or gaining unit via electronic means or by certified mail. IFTUs will
maintain either hard copy or electronic copies of the training record for 2 years after the class
graduation date.
