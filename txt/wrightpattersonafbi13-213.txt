                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. This Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI) provides guidance for Wright-Patterson’s
     Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian
     control on the airfield. It outlines program responsibilities, AF IMT 483, Certificate of
     Competency issuance, and training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD,
     Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on the
     airfield.
     1.1.2. Vehicle operations on the airfield are necessary for normal operations and
     maintenance. However, they present a clear and definite danger to aircraft and ground
     personnel. Failure to follow procedures, inadequate training, poor communications, and loss
     of situational awareness are inexcusable and major factors in aircraft/vehicle collisions,
     incidents and personal injuries. Trained personnel must be knowledgeable of all airfield
     driving rules and comply with the provisions of AFI 13-213 and this instruction.
     1.1.3. Unit Commanders and Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM) must ensure
     vehicle operators are properly trained and remain competent to drive on the airfield.
     Additionally, they must limit the number of assigned airfield drivers and vehicle movement
     on the airfield to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.

              TRAINING, TESTING AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Procedures for Issuing AF IMT 483.
   3.1.1. All base assigned personnel (e.g. military, DoD civilian, Contractor, etc.) required to
   operate a vehicle on the airfield must complete all airfield driver training and testing
   requirements outlined in AFI 13-213 and this instruction prior to issuance of an AF IMT 483.
   3.1.2. Unit ADPMs will ensure the training requirements on Attachment 11, Airfield
   Driving Qualification Training (Curriculum) Checklist and Attachment 10, Training
   Documentation and Certification Checklist are completely signed off and certify completion
   of training by signing in the appropriate sections of each. The ADPM will also ensure that
   all airfield restrictions (e.g. “DAYTIME ONLY”, “E/W RAMP ONLY”) are annotated.
   3.1.3. Individuals (or ADPM) will bring a copy of the completed and unit ADPM endorsed
   checklists in paragraph 3.1.2., to the AFM or AAFM, along with a copy of their Airfield
   Driving CBT certificate, written test score sheets and a pre-filled AF IMT 483 (See
   Attachment 19). The AF IMT 483 will not be endorsed without all required paperwork.
      3.1.3.1. As a quality control measure, random individuals that come to AM for their AF
      IMT 483 may be administered an airfield driving familiarization spot test with minimum
      passing score of 80% (corrected to 100%). Failure of this test will be handled in the same
      manner as test failures identified in paragraph 3.3.5
   3.1.4. The AFM, AAFM or designated AM representative will validate all paperwork,
   endorse checklists and sign the front of AF IMT 483. Note: Authority for signing the front
   of AF IMT 483 will not be delegated outside of AM.
   3.1.5. Personnel who PCS, separate, or retire must turn in their AF IMT 483 to their unit
   ADPM. The ADPM will ensure they update the unit’s listing of qualified drivers and will
   return Attachment 10 and Attachment 11 to the individual.
   3.1.6. When personnel PCA between units on base, the losing ADPM ensures all airfield
   driving records are transferred to the gaining unit ADPM. The losing ADPM removes the
   individual from the unit’s list of airfield drivers. The gaining ADPM will verify completion
   and currency of the individual’s training against the unit’s training/certification requirements.
   3.1.7. Personnel who lose their AF IMT 483 can be reissued a new one by hand carrying the
   original Attachment 10 and Attachment 11 and a current copy of the AF Airfield Driving
   CBT certificate to AM. The AFM, AAFM or designated AM representative will verify
   training/testing documentation and issue a new AF IMT 483.
   3.1.8. Personnel who lose their Attachment 10 and Attachment 11 and still have a valid AF
   IMT 483 for WPAFB may be recertified to drive on the airfield by the unit ADPM. The
   ADPM will complete new checklists and make a statement on each to indicate it is a
   replacement for a lost original or refresher and verify all training requirements are current.
   3.1.9. CMA access will only be authorized when mission requirements dictate and will be
   annotated on the AF IMT 483 when issued. All other personnel will have an AF IMT 483
   with restrictions annotated on the AF IMT 483 (e.g. E/W RAMP ONLY, E/W RAMP &
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                       17


   TAXIWAYS ONLY, DAYLIGHT ONLY, etc.). Personnel with an AF IMT 483 before the
   date of this instruction will be “grandfathered” until annual refresher training is due. After
   completing annual refresher training all personnel will be issued a license with the
   appropriate restrictions, signed by the AFM/AAFM.
       3.1.9.1. Personnel with restrictions will coordinate with their unit ADPM and the
       AFM/AAFM for a new AF IMT 483 when access to additional areas is required.
       3.1.9.2. Restrictions will be annotated on Attachment 10 and Attachment 11.
3.2. Training Criteria.
   3.2.1. Unit ADPMs (and/or designated trainers) will conduct airfield drivers training and
   ensure completion of all pre-requisite airfield driving requirements for unit assigned
   personnel.
   3.2.2. Use Attachment 10 (available for download at WPADS) to document airfield drivers
   training and certification on all newly assigned or employed/hired personnel. Units may
   incorporate additional local requirements.
   3.2.3. Use Attachment 11 (available for download at WPADS) as an on-the-job training
   checklist/curriculum to conduct and document airfield drivers qualification training on all
   newly assigned/hired personnel. Units may incorporate additional local requirements.
   3.2.4. Completion of the USAF Airfield Driving CBT, accessible on the Advanced
   Distributed Learning website, is required for all base assigned airfield drivers prior to
   issuance of an AF IMT 483. Note: Newly assigned or hired individuals may use a prior
   USAF Airfield Driving CBT completion date to fulfill this requirement if date completed is
   within the last 12 months.
       3.2.4.1. The USAF Airfield Driving CBT completion certificate must be turned in to the
       unit ADPM and the completion date documented on Attachment 10.
   3.2.5. Unit ADPMs or designated trainers will conduct airfield driver’s classroom training
   utilizing the WPAFB Airfield Driving Classroom Training power point presentation
   available for download at WPADS.
   3.2.6. Unit ADPMs or designated trainers will conduct practical day and night (as
   applicable) airfield familiarization training. At a minimum, practical airfield familiarization
   training involves taking the individual out on the airfield to show them how to get to and
   from their work areas. Use Attachment 10 to document completion of training.
       3.2.6.1. Daytime Familiarization Training. The goal is to familiarize the trainee with the
       airfield layout (e.g., markings, lighting, signage, restricted areas, entry control points,
       CMA, etc.) and to give practical training on operating the vehicle on the airfield (e.g.,
       access points, foreign object and debris [FOD] checks, speed limits, driving around
       aircraft, aircraft taxi flow, etc.). The duration of the orientation must ensure trainee
       proficiency on the airfield.
       3.2.6.2. Nighttime Familiarization Training. The goal is to familiarize the trainee with
       the airfield layout with emphasis on how things look different at night or during reduced
       visibility. Emphasis should focus on understanding airfield markings, lighting and
       signage to determine exact location on the airfield. Visual references, such as the control

   testing materials are controlled documents. Unit ADPMs, trainers, and trainees will protect
   the integrity of testing materials and safeguard them against compromise.
   3.3.3. The following tests will be administered by the unit ADPM:
      3.3.3.1. General Knowledge Test. This test will be no less than 10 questions and focus
      on information contained within this instruction. A minimum passing score of 80%
      (corrected to 100%) is required.
      3.3.3.2. Runway Incursion Prevention Test. This test will be no less than 5 questions
      and focus on eliminating and preventing runway incursions and CMAVs. A minimum
      passing score of 100% is required.
      3.3.3.3. Airfield Diagram/Layout Test. This test will ensure individuals know the
      location of runways, taxiways, parking ramps, service roads and airfield access points, as
      well as the location and description of VFR and instrument holding signs and markings.
      A minimum passing score of 100% is required.
      3.3.3.4. Communications Test. (only for personnel requiring CMA access). This test will
      consist of at least 5 questions with a minimum passing score of 100%.
      3.3.3.5. Practical Driving Test. This test includes evaluating the individual’s ability to:
      drive the vehicle during the check-ride; operate a vehicle in all areas required for the duty
      position/work areas without assistance; identify the location of runways and the CMA;
      demonstrate the ability to contact ATCT prior to entry on the runways/CMAs (for CMA
      drivers only). Note: Unit ADPM or designated trainer must conduct this test.
   3.3.4. Documentation of test completion and scores will be annotated on Attachment 10.
   3.3.5. Test Failures.
      3.3.5.1. First-time failures must receive additional training from the unit ADPM.
      Trainees can be rescheduled for testing upon completion of additional training but no
      earlier than 72 hours from the failure.
      3.3.5.2. Second-time failures must receive additional training from the unit ADPM. The
      ADPM will write a memorandum for record (MFR) outlining the retraining actions taken.
      A retest can be rescheduled no earlier than 10 days from the second failure.
      3.3.5.3. Third-time failures will normally not be granted a retest nor airfield driving
      privileges without approval by the AFM or AAFM.

3.4. Color Vision Requirements.
   3.4.1. Individuals who have a requirement to drive a vehicle on the CMA will be
   administered a color vision test by the unit ADPM using the Pseudo-Isochromatic Color
   Vision Test located on the WPADS. Results will be documented on Attachment 10.
      3.4.1.1. Trainees who fail to pass the color vision test requirements can be issued a
      limited access AF IMT 483. Note: Access to the CMA must not be granted.
      3.4.1.2. If further testing is required, military personnel may schedule testing through the
      88 ABW Medical Group. Civilians may schedule testing at the Occupational Medicine
      Flight or off-base Optometrist. Results will be documented on Attachment 10.
   3.4.2. Individuals who are required to have normal color vision as part of their Air Force
   Specialty Code (AFSC) only require verification that they successfully completed a color
   vision test by a Hospital/Medical Treatment Facility Optometrist or off-base equivalent.
      3.4.2.1. Refer to the Officer and Enlisted Classification Directory for AFSCs that have a
      mandatory requirement for normal color vision. Note: The Unit ADPM must validate
      that the individual has normal color vision and/or no waiver to the classification
      directory.
3.5. Annual Refresher Training Requirements.
   3.5.1. Airfield drivers must complete the following refresher training requirements annually:

                     OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

4.1. Vehicle Operations on the Airfield.
   4.1.1. Personnel driving on the airfield must have completed airfield drivers training IAW
   Chapter 3 of this instruction and possess a current AF IMT 483 or be escorted by a vehicle
   driver possessing a valid AF IMT 483 prior to entry to the airfield.
   4.1.2. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or non-base assigned contractors are responsible for
   providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF IMT 483 IAW Chapter 7.
   4.1.3. Individuals providing escort will ensure that the vehicle(s) they are escorting remain
   in close proximity of the escort vehicle and that no more than six vehicles are escorted at the
   same time. At no time will personnel/vehicles become separated while being escorted on the
   airfield. (See paragraph 5.1.4 and paragraph 5.2.8. for escort procedures in the CMA).
   4.1.4. Airfield Authorized Vehicles:
       4.1.4.1. Government Owned Vehicles (GOV) performing official duties.
       4.1.4.2. Personally Owned Vehicles (POV), Government Leased Vehicles (GLV), and
       contractor vehicles with a valid airfield pass issued by AM and in the performance of
       official duties.
       4.1.4.3. Unit owned all-terrain vehicles (ATV)/utility terrain vehicles (UTV) and golf
       carts are authorized on taxiways and aprons only. Drivers will be airfield driving
       certified and qualified to operate the vehicle.
   4.1.5. Bicycles, motorcycles, mopeds and scooters are not authorized on the airfield.
   4.1.6. Airfield support vehicles must coordinate with AMOPS when entering/exiting the
   airfield. For the purpose of this paragraph, airfield support vehicles are defined as vehicles
   engaged in airfield sweeping, mowing, snow removal, pavement repair, arresting gear
   maintenance/barrier checks, airfield electrical work, navigational/meteorological equipment
   repair, surveying, contractor operations, or any other vehicle supporting airfield maintenance,
   installation or repair. Multiple vehicles operating for the same purpose (i.e. snow removal,
   airfield maintenance, etc.) may make one report to AMOPS when entering/exiting the airfield
   provided all vehicles are accounted for. Note: This is not in lieu of contacting ATCT for
   access into the CMA.
   4.1.7. At a minimum, all vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain an AFVA 11-240
   (Figure 4.1) and a current locally developed airfield diagram. Vehicles that operate in the
   CMA must also contain an AFVA 13-222 (Figure 4.2). Decals may be permanently affixed
   in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the
   vehicle so it can be flipped down for easy reference.

Figure 4.1. AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs and Markings




Figure 4.2. AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area Procedures




4.2. Airfield Signs, Markings and Lighting. All vehicle operators must be knowledgeable of
the meaning and location of airfield signage, markings and lighting.
   4.2.1. Airfield Signs. Signs provide important guidance and control for the safe and
   efficient surface movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airfield. Signs provide information
   on location, direction, destination, mandatory holding positions, important boundaries, and
   other information.
      4.2.1.1. Mandatory Signs: Red sign with white legend, indicating mandatory holding
      positions for runways and ILS critical area boundaries.
          4.2.1.1.1. Mandatory signs provide instruction and must be followed. They denote
          an entrance to a runway or critical area. Vehicles are required to hold short unless
          approved by ATCT. Examples of mandatory signs are shown in Figure 4.3
 22                                  WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.3. Typical Mandatory Signs




          4.2.1.1.2. Runway hold signs are located at runway/taxiway intersections and define
          the beginning of the CMA, reminding drivers to hold short and obtain approval from
          ATCT prior to proceeding.
          4.2.1.1.3. “INST” Hold Signs are located at the outer boundaries of instrument
          critical areas. Vehicles will hold short of these signs and obtain permission from
          Tower prior to proceeding whenever the sign is lit, ceiling is below 800 feet and/or
          visibility is less than 2 miles, and/or ATCT or AMOPS has announced “ILS critical
          areas are protected”. (See paragraph 4.2.2.2 and paragraph 4.10.3)
      4.2.1.2. Location Signs: Black sign with yellow legend, identifying the taxiway on which
      the aircraft/vehicle is located. Note: Often taxiway location signs are part of a sign
      array, hence may be together with a mandatory hold sign or a guidance direction sign.

Figure 4.4. Typical Location Signs




      4.2.1.3. Informational Signs: Yellow sign with black legend providing direction,
      destination, and other information.
          4.2.1.3.1. Direction signs indicate the direction of taxiways leading out of an
          intersection, and are installed at runway exits, taxiway intersections, and other
          locations.
          4.2.1.3.2. Destination signs indicate the general direction to a remote location.

Figure 4.5. Typical Informational Signs
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                      23


   4.2.2. Airfield Markings. To move about safely on the airfield, vehicle operators must also
   be knowledgeable of airfield markings. Like signage, airfield markings provide guidance to
   aircraft/vehicles for safe and effective operations. Note: During periods of snow/ice cover
   when markings cannot be seen, operators will use posted signs to identify the CMA, etc.
      4.2.2.1. Runway Holding Position: Two solid yellow lines adjacent to two dashed
      yellow lines and bordered in black. Hold lines mark the boundary of the runway area and
      are painted across taxiways, at least 100 feet from the runway edge. These markings are
      co-located with Runway Hold Signs. Vehicle operators must always contact ATCT and
      obtain approval prior to proceeding beyond the hold line onto the runway.

   the following airfield lighting types and locations.
      4.2.3.1. Runway Lighting.
          4.2.3.1.1. Runway Edge Lights define the lateral limits of the runway and are white
          with exception of the last 2,000 feet which are amber.
          4.2.3.1.2. Runway Threshold Lights are green and define the beginning of the usable
          surface for landing aircraft.
          4.2.3.1.3. Runway End Lights are red and define the end of the usable runway
          surface for landing aircraft.

Figure 4.13. Typical Runway Lighting




          4.2.3.1.4. Approach Lighting. Runway 05L/23R is equipped with approach lighting
          to provide visual guidance to pilots for alignment with the runway and for final
          corrections before landing. These lights are white with exception of red pre-threshold
          and terminating bars located in the underrun. They begin just prior to the runway
          threshold and extend 3,000 feet into the approach zone.
          4.2.3.1.5. Runway Guard Lights consist of two alternating yellow lights that provide
          a distinctive warning to anyone approaching runway or instrument holding positions.
          These lights are located at selective runway and instrument hold positions.

   4.4.11. During emergencies, all emergency response vehicles (i.e. fire, crash equipment,
   ambulances, Airfield Management, and Security Forces), may exceed speed limits with due
   regard for the safety of persons and property. Emergency vehicles will not automatically
   assume the right of way.
   4.4.12. To expedite airfield inspections, airfield checks, mammal and bird dispersal efforts,
   Airfield Management vehicles are authorized to operate on runways, taxiways and
   infield/out-field areas commensurate with safety but not to exceed 50 MPH. This includes
   other vehicles such as Flight Safety, Security Forces and Wildlife Services personnel
   supporting Airfield Management with wildlife dispersal.
   4.4.13. Anytime ATCT directs a driver to “expedite” or directs a vehicle action with the
   term “immediately,” the driver may temporarily exceed the speed limit commensurate with
 28                                   WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013


   safety to avoid endangerment. Once the vehicle is clear of aircraft operations, the driver will
   resume normal/approved speed limits.
4.5. Vehicles Operating in the Immediate Vicinity of Aircraft.
   4.5.1. Vehicles operated near an aircraft will remain well clear of the aircraft, and be visible
   from the aircraft cockpit.
   4.5.2. All vehicles will approach parked aircraft with the driver side nearest the aircraft.
   4.5.3. Vehicles will not be driven within 25 feet of any aircraft except when servicing,
   loading or off-loading the aircraft.
   4.5.4. Vehicles will not be backed in the direction of an aircraft without a spotter behind the

   unless required for the arm/de-arming operation.
   4.5.10. Vehicles will not be driven into the path of a taxiing aircraft with the exception of a
   Transient Alert “Follow Me” vehicle. Never drive a vehicle between a “Follow Me” vehicle
   or marshal and an aircraft or into the path of an emergency response vehicle and an
   emergency aircraft.
   4.5.11. Vehicles will give way to all taxiing and towed aircraft.
       4.5.11.1. Vehicles must be at least 200 feet from the taxiway/taxilane centerline to avoid
       taxiing/towed aircraft.
       4.5.11.2. Vehicle operators must maintain situational awareness at all times and be
       prepared to take appropriate actions to avoid interference with aircraft operations.
       4.5.11.3. If it is necessary to drive off the paved surface to avoid an aircraft, re-entry to
       the paved surface will only be accomplished after inspecting tire treads and removing any
       debris found. Ensure the paved surface is FOD-free after entry.
4.6. Airfield Right-of-Way Priorities.
   4.6.1. Right-of-way will be given to the following:
       4.6.1.1. Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency. Note: Emergency vehicles
       will not automatically assume the right of way.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                        29

   and/or equipment be left unattended.
   4.7.2. No vehicles or equipment will be parked on infield/outfield areas unless approved by
   the AFM/AAFM.
   4.7.3. Authorized vehicles and equipment may be parked on ramp areas to conduct official
   business, but will be removed from the ramp area when no longer required.
   4.7.4. All vehicles parked and left unattended (driver’s seat vacated) on the airfield will be
   unlocked and have the ignition turned off with key left in the ignition. The parking brake
   will be engaged and the gear lever placed in park (automatic transmission) or reverse
   (manual).
      4.7.4.1. Vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral braking system
      will have one rear wheel chocked (both front and back of the tire) while parked.
   4.7.5. Vehicles parked alongside of aircraft will have the driver’s side toward the aircraft, be
   located clear of aircraft wingtips and clearly visible to personnel in the cockpit.
   4.7.6. Vehicles will be parked so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will
   not be toward any aircraft.
   4.7.7. Passenger carrying vehicles will only stop at the side of an aircraft when actually
   loading or unloading personnel.
   4.7.8. All motor vehicles will use emergency warning flashers (direction lights, front and
   rear) when parked on the ramp area during hours of darkness or inclement weather.
   4.7.9. Emergency vehicles that must remain in operation at the scene of an emergency, and
   aircraft servicing support vehicles, which require the vehicle’s engine to operate as a power
   source for auxiliary components, may be left unattended while the engine is running.
   However, the parking brake will be set, the transmission placed in neutral or park, and the
   rear wheels chocked fore and aft.
   4.7.10. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) towing vehicles may be placed in neutral while
   the driver completes hookup operations to facilitate movement. Drivers must shut off their
   vehicle, place the vehicle in park (automatic) or reverse (manual) and set the parking brake if
   they do not depart with the AGE equipment following hookup.
   4.7.11. Snow removal operators may leave vehicle engines running for servicing and
   removing accumulated snow and ice from their equipment under the following conditions:
      4.7.11.1. The surrounding area (a minimum of 500 feet in any direction) is void of
      aircraft. A remote location is preferred.
 30                                     WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013


      4.7.11.2. The transmission lever is placed in park (automatic) or neutral (manual).
      4.7.11.3. Parking brake is set.
      4.7.11.4. Chocks are placed fore and aft of at least one rear wheel if vehicle does not
      have an integral braking system.
      4.7.11.5. Removed snow and ice does not pose a FOD hazard to aircraft or vehicles.
   4.7.12. Vehicles will not be parked within Instrument Landing System (ILS) critical areas
   when ILS critical areas are protected.
   4.7.13. Vehicles will not be parked unattended in front of hangar doors.
4.8. Lateral Distance Requirements for Fixed and Mobile Obstacles.
   4.8.1. Vehicles and equipment are considered mobile obstacles. Do not leave vehicles or

      4.8.1.2. 200 feet from a taxiway or taxilane centerline.
      4.8.1.3. 125 feet from the edge of an aircraft parking apron.
   4.8.2. AGE equipment may be staged on aircraft parking spots no earlier than three hours
   prior to arrival and will remain no later than three hours after departure.
4.9. Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD) Control and Prevention.
   4.9.1. Prior to entering the airfield (or as otherwise directed by Airfield Management),
   vehicle operators must conduct a thorough FOD check which shall, at a minimum, consist of
   the following:
      4.9.1.1. A “rolling” inspection of vehicle tires. Stop the vehicle, check and remove
      debris (e.g., rocks, gravel, etc.) from all tires, pull the vehicle forward 18 to 24 inches,
      then once again check for and remove any debris, as applicable.
      4.9.1.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components and equipment carried
      on the vehicle is properly stowed and secured, including all tie-down device loose ends
      such as chains, ropes, packaging or other items that may become dislodged during
      movement while on the airfield.
      4.9.1.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn
      parts.
   4.9.2. Emergency vehicles responding to actual emergencies and alert vehicles responding to
   an alert are exempt from conducting a FOD check prior to entering the airfield; however,
   must complete a FOD check IAW paragraph 4.9.1, once the actual emergency or alert is
   over.
   4.9.3. Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
   driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt or grass). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
   required, drivers must conduct a thorough FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to
   paved surfaces and remove any debris from tires prior to re-entry onto paved areas.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                         31


       4.9.3.1. Inspect vehicle undercarriages, tires, and wheel wells for mud, snow and ice.
       Remove accumulated mud, snow or ice to the maximum extent possible. Drive slowly at
       the edge of the paved shoulder and depart the airfield from the closest, most direct and
       approved route. Monitor the pavement as you exit and immediately notify AMOPS if
       sweeping is required. Wash and clean the undercarriage of the vehicle before re-entry
       onto the airfield.
   4.9.4. Everyone is responsible for keeping the airfield safe and FOD-free. Vehicle operators
   encountering any debris on the airfield must stop, pick it up and properly dispose of it.
   Immediately report large amounts of debris to AMOPS.
   4.9.5. Per WPAFBI 21-101, Foreign Object Damage and Dropped Object Prevention
   Program, hats/berets will not be worn on the airfield. Exception: When conducting official
   protocol duties on the airfield, the senior officer present, or his/her representative, will
   consider factors including weather and proximity to operating aircraft engines and dictate if
   hats are to be worn for a particular occasion (this does not include baggage and aircraft
   support personnel). No individual wearing a hat, regardless of rank, will pass within 25 feet
   of an operating engine.
   4.9.6. Authorized headgear for extreme cold weather protection may be worn; however,
   every effort must be made to prevent such headgear from coming loose during duty
   performance. Special attention to the FOD potential and safety of personnel will be prime
   considerations when determining extreme cold weather clothing authorizations.
   4.9.7. All personnel are prohibited from wearing loose fitting items that could be ingested by
   operating jet engines. The wearing of wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners, earrings or other
   jewelry in high FOD potential areas is prohibited. Badges such as AF Form 1199 will be
   secured with a nylon/cotton cord or plastic armband.
4.10. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   4.10.1. Vehicle operations during night or adverse conditions can produce significant
   challenges due to diminished depth perception, glare, and limited visibility. Poor weather
   conditions (e.g., fog, rain, etc.) might obscure visual cues, pavement markings, and airfield
   signs. This can degrade a driver’s situational awareness and increase his/her chances of
   committing a runway incursion. Vehicle operators must remain vigilant of their surroundings
   and operating boundaries.
       4.10.1.1. Taxiways can be distinguished from runways by blue lights along the edges and
       solid yellow taxi lines painted down the center of the taxiway. Runways have
       white/amber lights along the edges with broken white painted markings down the center
       of the runway.
   4.10.2. Do not direct headlights toward the cockpit of an approaching aircraft. Give right-
   of-way to the aircraft; turn off your headlights and leave parking lights on so the pilot can see
   your vehicle. Leave the headlights off until the aircraft is out of range. Vehicle operators will
   also exercise caution to ensure headlights do not point toward aircraft towing operations, so
   tow vehicle operators are not blinded.
   4.10.3. Vehicles must hold short of all “INST” markings/signs and obtain permission from
   ATCT prior to proceeding whenever the sign is lit, ceiling is below 800 feet and/or visibility
 32                                   WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013


   is less than 2 miles, and/or ATCT or AMOPS has announced “ILS critical areas are
   protected”(See paragraph 4.2.1.1.3. and paragraph 4.2.2.2.). If in doubt, the vehicle
   operator shall contact ATCT to verify whether or not the ILS critical areas are currently
   protected.
   4.10.4. All vehicles will operate with four-way warning flasher lights or overhead rotating
   lights on (day or night) during inclement weather anywhere on the airfield. Exception:
   Specialized aircraft service vehicles (i.e., passenger staircase trucks, latrine servicing trucks,
   etc.) after the vehicle is positioned at the aircraft being serviced, and AGE tow vehicles
   during the momentary, non-delayed, pick up and drop off of equipment. Vehicles exempted
   under these circumstances must be reflected to indicate length, width, and height IAW T.O.
   36-1-191.
   4.10.5. Vehicle operations during night or adverse conditions can produce significant
   challenges due to diminished depth perception, glare, and limited visibility. This can degrade
   an operator’s situational awareness and increase his/her chances of committing a runway
   incursion.
   4.10.6. Reduced Visibility Restrictions:
      4.10.6.1. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive loaded (laden)
      vehicles will not be operated unless directed by the wing or installation commander.
      4.10.6.2. When visibility is less than 100 feet, private motor vehicles and airfield
      vehicles (except emergency and alert vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield.
      Flashing lights will be used on all vehicles temporarily parked on the aircraft parking
      ramps during the periods of lowered visibility.
      4.10.6.3. When visibility is less than 50 feet, it is recommended that a walking guide
      equipped with flashing or luminescent wand be used during emergency movement of
      alert vehicles.
4.11. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ).
   4.11.1. The POFZ is an 800 ft. wide by 200 ft. long rectangular area centered on the runway
   centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the end of the runway, designed to
   protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and other aircraft when the
   ceiling is less than 300 ft., or the visibility is less than 3/4 statute mile (See Attachment 8).
   4.11.2. Vehicles that are less than 10 ft. in height operating outside of the CMA and
   necessary for maintenance of airfield and/or navigation facilities are allowed to transverse the
   POFZ. These vehicles will maintain radio contact with ATCT when allowed to park in these
   areas. There are no normal vehicle operations in the POFZ except for mowers.
   4.11.3. Vehicles over 10 ft. high must remain outside of the POFZ during inclement weather.
   Vehicle operators will contact ATCT to determine if ceiling and visibility will restrict
   operations.
4.12. Daytime Running Lights (DRL).
   4.12.1. Vehicles equipped with daytime running lights will attempt to turn off/disable the
   headlights but leave parking lights and/or emergency flashers on.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                         33


   4.12.2. If unable to disable the DRLs, vehicle operators will position the vehicle so that the
   headlights are facing away from aircraft, or turn the vehicle off. If the vehicle is turned off,
   the emergency flashers will remain on. Once the aircraft passes out of range, the vehicle may
   be restarted.
4.13. Vehicles Equipped With Supplemental Traction Devices.
   4.13.1. Tire chains may only be used on airfield pavements after obtaining
   coordination/approval from the Airfield Manager, Wing Safety, and Civil Engineer. The
   requesting agency must conduct an operational risk assessment with the above agencies when
   evaluating the need for tire chains to minimize pavement damage and FOD.
   4.13.2. Vehicles equipped with studded tires are not authorized to operate on the airfield.
4.14. Jet Blast.
   4.14.1. Personnel on the airfield will exercise extreme caution when driving behind any
   aircraft with engines running.
   4.14.2. When engines are running or about to be started, remain at least 25 feet to the front
   or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft. Note: When operating near large aircraft, such as C-5,
   C-17, B-747, KC-10, etc., use extreme caution due to jet engine blast.
   4.14.3. Full power engine runs will occur on the West ramp posing a hazard to vehicles/
   personnel traversing Taxiway Alpha behind the West ramp or in the grassy area between the
   West ramp and Taxiway Alpha. Vehicle operators may contact ATCT or AMOPS to verify
   engine runs taking place on the West ramp. In the event of an engine run, vehicles/personnel
   will exit the area until the engine run is complete.
4.15. Procedures for Emergency Response Vehicles.
   4.15.1. Emergency Vehicles (i.e., Fire/Crash Recovery, Medical, Bioenvironmental
   Engineering, Airfield Management, Safety, and Security Forces) responding to an aircraft
   emergency (with rotating emergency lights in operation) have priority over normal vehicular
   traffic. However, emergency response vehicles shall not automatically assume right of way.
   4.15.2. Emergency vehicles will not cross or enter any runway without approval from
   ATCT.
       4.15.2.1. To facilitate the fastest possible response time of emergency response vehicles,
       ATCT shall anticipate emergency response vehicle movement on the airfield after
       activation of the Primary or Secondary Crash phones. Upon arrival of an in-flight
       emergency (IFE) aircraft, ATCT may announce over the radio, using the CFR-1 talk
       group, unsolicited emergency response vehicle authorizations to enter the runway; i.e.
       “ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES PROCEED ON (active runway) AT
       (location).”
       4.15.2.2. If ATCT does not automatically provide runway clearance for emergency
       response vehicles, operators must obtain ATCT approval prior to CMA entry.
   4.15.3. The Incident Commander (IC) is responsible for advising ATCT when all emergency
   vehicles have exited the runway.

      Chief.
   4.15.5. All emergency response vehicles operating on the airfield during non-emergency
   operations will adhere to normal airfield driving procedures.
4.16. Restricted Areas.
   4.16.1. Restricted areas are delineated by a red painted line on the surface of the pavement or
   with use of rope and stanchions. Restricted areas are accessible via an established entry
   control point (ECP) marked with a painted white rectangle, sign or a break in the rope.
   Vehicle operators must always enter and exit restricted areas via designated ECPs, unless
   prior coordinated with and approved by Security Forces to break red in the performance of
   official duties (i.e. snow and ice removal vehicles, airfield sweeper, etc.)
   4.16.2. Operators entering restricted areas must possess an AF Form 1199 appropriately
   designated for authorization in the area or an approved and authenticated Entry Authorization
   List (EAL), or be escorted by an authorized person.
   4.16.3. Airfield restricted areas include:
      4.16.3.1. The West Ramp (Attachment 7).
      4.16.3.2. E-4B parking area located on N-1, East Ramp. (See Attachment 6)
      4.16.3.3. Transient aircraft that require establishment of a temporary restricted area will
      be defined by the use of rope and stanchions unless otherwise coordinated by the AFM
      for FOD and safety concerns.
4.17. Controlled Areas.
   4.17.1. The entire airfield, defined as “all areas supporting aircraft operations to include:
   operations facilities, runways, taxiways, parking aprons, hangar access aprons and all
   grounds identified by controlled area signs” is a controlled area (Attachment 5).
   4.17.2. The designation “Controlled Area” carries the same legal and moral restrictions as a
   physical barrier. Only personnel who possess a valid AF 1199 with appropriately designated
   authorization or an approved and authenticated EAL or are escorted by an authorized person
   may access the airfield.
4.18. ATCT and/or Vehicle Radio Problem Areas and Visual Blind Spots.
   4.18.1. ATCT and/or vehicle radio problem areas (intermittent LMR use only) include H
   row, spot 1 and the East Ramp between Hangars 206N and 206S (See Attachment 2).
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                        35


   4.18.2. ATCT/vehicle visual blind spots include but are not limited to the south corner of the
   East Ramp, between/behind all hangars on the East Ramp, F – H rows, the fuel cell area
   accessing Taxiway B north, and the “Aero Club” parking ramp (See Attachment 2).
4.19. Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) Operations.
   4.19.1. AGE equipment, electrical carts, forklifts, tow bars, fire extinguishers, maintenance
   stands, portable lighting and similar equipment (when not in use) will be removed from the
   aircraft parking area and stored in appropriate areas IAW Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-
   260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
   4.19.2. Personnel will not leave aircraft support equipment (i.e., fire extinguishers, ladders,
   chocks, work stands, tugs, etc.) where it presents a potential hazard to taxiing or towed
   aircraft. When personnel are not using equipment, they will remove it from the airfield and
   store it in a designated location. Personnel will secure all equipment left outdoors to prevent
   accidental movement by wind or engine blast.
   4.19.3. Equipment will not be in place earlier than three hours prior to aircraft arrival and no
   longer than three hours after aircraft departure IAW UFC 3-260-01.
4.20. Traffic Lanes.
   4.20.1. Vehicles will be driven to the extreme right side of taxiway/taxilane centerlines
   unless otherwise directed or required to maintain a safe distance from taxiing, towed or
   parked aircraft and emergency response vehicles. See Figure 4.16. Note: Under normal
   circumstances, the only vehicles authorized to operate on the centerline of any taxiway or
   runway include, but are not limited to, AM and Flight Safety, airfield maintenance vehicles
   (i.e., sweeper, snow and ice control equipment, etc.), and vehicles towing aircraft.

       4.20.1.1. Vehicles will drive to the extreme left side of the west parallel taxilane
       centerline on the West Ramp to ensure the driver’s side of the vehicle is closest to parked
       aircraft.

Figure 4.17. West Ramp Traffic Flow




   4.20.2. Vehicles will be operated single-file unless in direct support of an aircraft,
   responding to an emergency or otherwise required for official duties.
4.21. Arm/De-Arm Areas. HAZPAD 4 and the north end of Taxiway B between the approach
ends of Runways 23R and 23L are designated aircraft weapons arm/de-arm areas. During
arming/de-arming operations, vehicles not in direct support of operations shall not enter or pass
these areas (See Attachment 2).
4.22. Hot Spots. The approach end of Runway 23L is considered a “Hot Spot” due to an
increased potential for runway incursions. Both the extended pavement width of Taxiway B at
the west intersection and the position of the threshold of Runway 23L (south of the Taxiway B
intersection) could lead a vehicle operator to mistake the runway as a continuation of Taxiway B.
All airfield drivers must be knowledgeable of this area and exercise extreme caution to avoid
committing a runway incursion (See Attachment 2).
4.23. In-Ground Fuel Pit Covers. Vehicle operators will not drive over in-ground fuel pit
covers. In-ground fuel pit cover locations include the West Ramp, spots A-1 through A-12 and
the East Ramp, spots I-1 and I-2.
4.24. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Carpet. Personnel are not to drive over the DV red carpets
(“T” shaped brick) located directly in front of AMOPS, Building 206 and in front Hangar 206S
unless in direct support of DV aircraft.
4.25. Vehicle Night Vision Device (NVD) Procedures. Operating a vehicle on the airfield with
NVDs is prohibited.
4.26. Airfield Smoking Policy. The airfield, defined as “all areas supporting aircraft operations
to include: operations facilities, runways, taxiways, parking aprons, hangar access aprons and all
grounds identified by controlled area signs” is designated a “no smoking area”. Exception:
Commanders and Directors may designate smoking areas that are located only on non-aircraft

movement area sides of hangars or other airfield support facilities. Prior coordination with and
approval by the Fire Emergency Services Flight and Airfield Manager is required.
4.27. Cell Phone Use on the Airfield.
   4.27.1. Cell phones will not be used while driving on the airfield.
   4.27.2. Cell phones should not be used during aircraft servicing unless specified in the
   appropriate technical order or guidance for the particular operation being conducted, or:
       4.27.2.1. Within 50 feet of any pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing components.
       4.27.2.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
       4.27.2.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet at any time.

                                           Chapter 5

      CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA (CMA) AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

5.1. Vehicle/Pedestrian Operations In The Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   5.1.1. The CMA is defined as runways, overruns/underruns and any area within 100 feet of
   these areas (Attachment 3). Access to the CMA shall be limited to mission essential
   operations.
   5.1.2. The mandatory runway hold signs and markings indicate the CMA boundary. Barrier
   access roads have white stop bars near the shelters to indicate the CMA boundary. Stop bars
   are also painted across approach lighting access roads prior to Runway 05L and 23R
   overruns.
   5.1.3. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may gain access to, cross, or work in the CMA
   without establishing two-way radio contact with and receiving specific approval from the
   ATCT (“Patterson Ground”). Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted into
   the CMA by an AF IMT 483 licensed vehicle operator and/or pedestrian that has two-way
   radio contact with ATCT.
   5.1.4. Only personnel with “CMA Access” annotated on their AF IMT 483 are authorized to
   escort other persons/vehicles into the CMA. The individual providing the escort will ensure
   that the person/vehicle they are escorting remains in close proximity of the escort vehicle. At
   no time will personnel/vehicles become separated while being escorted in the CMA. See
   paragraph 5.2.7, for proper escort phraseology.
   5.1.5. Two-way radio communications with ATCT will be maintained at all times while in
   the CMA.
   5.1.6. Any time the ATCT directs vehicles or personnel to exit the CMA, they shall
   acknowledge instructions and depart the CMA immediately by the most direct route.
   5.1.7. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must notify ATCT after exiting the CMA. See
   Table 5.6
   5.1.8. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers
   when driving in the CMA.
   5.1.9. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio should only be
   used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an
   operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
   5.1.10. ATCT will not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when
   authorizing vehicles to enter the runway, except as noted in paragraph 4.15.2.1
   5.1.11. Runway crossings are restricted to personnel performing mission essential duties and
   then only to an absolute minimum. The departure end of the runways is the preferred point
   during flying operations. Taxiway Charlie is the preferred crossing point during non-flying
   operations.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                          39


   5.1.12. Hot Spot: The approach end of Runway 23L is considered a “Hot Spot” due to an
   increased potential for runway incursions. Both the extended pavement width of Taxiway B
   at the west intersection and the position of the threshold of Runway 23L (south of the
   Taxiway B intersection) could lead a vehicle operator to mistake the runway as a
   continuation of Taxiway B. All airfield drivers must be knowledgeable of this area and
   exercise extreme caution to avoid committing a runway incursion (See Attachment 2).
   5.1.13. ATCT will never issue blanket approval to enter or cross more than one runway.
   Vehicle operators approved to enter or cross a runway must exit that runway before receiving
   approval for a subsequent runway entry or crossing. Airfield drivers shall exercise extreme
   caution when operating between runways, maintain their situational awareness at all times
   and ensure proper communication procedures are followed to prevent a runway incursion.
   5.1.14. In the event of a vehicle or ATCT radio failure, the following procedures will be
   implemented:
      5.1.14.1. ATCT will flash the runway edge lights on and off and/or use light-gun signals
      (Figure 5.1) to alert vehicle and/or pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem
      and/or emergency that requires them to immediately exit the runway.
      5.1.14.2. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway as quickly and safely as
      possible upon experiencing radio failure and/or noticing flashing runway edge lights.
      Contact ATCT or AMOPS immediately and advise “OFF” the runway and include any
      pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to
      communicate with ATCT or AMOPS via radio, use other means of communication such
      as a cellular phone (when available). If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating
      the runway, should turn the vehicle toward the ATCT and start flashing the vehicle
      headlights and wait for the controller to signal the light gun.
      5.1.14.3. All vehicle operators are required to know and comply with the following
      signals:

Figure 5.1. ATCT Light Gun Signals




5.2. Radio Communications Phraseology, Discipline and Techniques.
   5.2.1. Vehicle operators/pedestrians must contact ATCT each and every time they wish to
   proceed onto the CMA or upon exiting the CMA via the “TOWER” LMR net. Exception:
   Fire Department may use the “CFR-1” net.
 40                                  WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013


   5.2.2. Vehicle drivers and pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call sign. A
   listing of approved call signs that are commonly used on the airfield is identified in
   Attachment 18. A complete listing of approved call signs is maintained at Airfield
   Management. Note: 88 SFS call signs are posted in the WPAFB Integrated Defense Plan.
      5.2.2.1. Temporary call signs for personnel such as TDY or non-base assigned
      contractors will be approved by the AAFM or designated AM representative to avoid
      duplication, confusion, or different agencies using similar names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield
      Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.).
   5.2.3. When contacting ATCT to request permission onto the CMA, vehicle operators must
   advise the controller of three things: WHO they are, WHERE they are, and WHAT their
   intentions are.

Table 5.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology
VEHICLE OPERATOR:             “PATTERSON GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE”

ATCT:                         “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS RUNWAY TWO THREE LEFT AT
                              CHARLIE” or
                              “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO THREE
                              LEFT”
   5.2.4. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all ATCT communications with their call
   sign, repeat instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for correction, if
   misinterpreted.

 VEHICLE OPERATOR:             “AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER”
 ATCT:                         “AIRFIELD ONE, READ BACK HOLD INSTRUCTIONS”
 VEHICLE OPERATOR:             “AIRFIELD ONE WILL HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO
                               THREE RIGHT ON TAXIWAY ALPHA”
   5.2.7. The words “clear” or “clearance” must not be used in communication with ATCT.
   These words are reserved for communications between ATCT and aircraft. Instead, report
   “OFF” the runway.

Table 5.5. Sample Reporting Off Runway

 VEHICLE OPERATOR:             “PATTERSON GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE PLUS TWO OFF
                               RUNWAY TWO THREE LEFT AT TAXIWAY CHARLIE”
 ATCT:                         “AIRFIELD ONE PLUS TWO, ROGER”

   5.2.8. Personnel providing escort will add the number of vehicles they are escorting into the
   CMA with their call sign.

     5.2.11. Radio Techniques.
        5.2.11.1. Radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible. However, controllers
        must know who you are, where you are and what you want to do. Conversely, vehicle
        operators/pedestrians must know exactly what the controller wants them to do.
        5.2.11.2. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is speaking, the keying of another
        transmitter will be ineffective and will likely override/block out the other receiver
        causing the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
        5.2.11.3. Think before keying the transmitter. Know exactly what you need to say
        before you say it.
        5.2.11.4. The microphone should be close to your lips and, after pressing the
        “microphone button”, a slight pause will be necessary to be sure the first word is
        transmitted clearly. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
        5.2.11.5. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling
        again. The controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different
        frequency, or scanning the runway to enable your request.
        5.2.11.6. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
        recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
        position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
        unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
        “stuck mike” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
        problem.
        5.2.11.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a
        vehicle at the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely
        parked.

        REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

6.1. Revoking and Suspending AF IMT 483.
   6.1.1. Anyone violating the provisions of this instruction may be removed from the airfield
   by AMOPS and/or detained by Security Forces, as appropriate.
   6.1.2. Unit commanders, unit ADPMs, AM, and Security Forces personnel have the
   authority to temporarily suspend airfield driving privileges of any individual who fails or
   refuses to comply with procedures established in this instruction or other applicable
   guidance.
      6.1.2.1. The AAFM will be notified in writing by the Unit Commander or ADPM when
      airfield driving privileges of unit assigned personnel are suspended.
      6.1.2.2. The unit ADPM and/or AAFM will notify the Unit Commander of all unit
      assigned personnel who have their airfield driving privileges suspended or revoked.
   6.1.3. Upon suspension or revocation of a unit member’s civilian driver’s license and/or base
   driving privileges, the Unit Commander will suspend/revoke the member’s airfield driving
   authorization (AF IMT 483) and notify the Unit ADPM and AAFM in writing.
6.2. Reissuing Suspended AF IMT 483.
   6.2.1. Individuals may only have their AF IMT 483 reinstated after completing remedial
   training and certification conducted by the unit ADPM. This training will consist of all initial
   training and testing requirements in Chapter 3 of this instruction and be documented on a
   new Attachment 10 and Attachment 11. Upon completion of mandated suspension and
   retraining/certification, the Unit Commander must recommend in writing that the
   individual’s airfield driving privileges are reinstated (See Attachment 16).
   6.2.2. If an individual is mission essential and required to drive on the airfield prior to the
   indicated suspension expiration, the unit commander must provide a written request to the 88
   ABW/CC IAW paragraph 2.1.2, for early reinstatement (See Attachment 15).
   6.2.3. To receive a new AF IMT 483 the individual must bring paperwork identified in
   paragraph 3.1.3., as well as the Unit Commander’s recommendation letter to AM for
   reissue. A new AF IMT 483 will not be issued without all required paperwork.
6.3. Reporting and Documenting CMAV Events.
   6.3.1. A CMAV event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians
   entering the CMA without specific ATCT approval. This definition also includes runway
   incursions. A runway incursion is a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an
   aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
   take-off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
   CMA.
      6.3.1.1. Unit Commander, unit ADPM and AM must be notified immediately of any
      CMAV event. The AFM or AAFM will notify HQ AFMC/A3OO within 24 hours of a
      CMAV/HATR incident.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                       45


      6.3.1.2. For an actual or suspected runway incursion, the individual’s AF IMT 483 will
      be surrendered to AM and airfield driving privileges temporarily suspended until an
      investigation and/or retraining is completed.
          6.3.1.2.1. The Unit Commander of the individual who committed a runway incursion
          will be notified that one of their unit personnel was involved in a CMAV and the
          incident is under investigation. This notification will be made within 24 hours or the
          next duty day of the alleged incident, whichever occurs first.
          6.3.1.2.2. Runway Incursions and CMAV events will be reported to 88ABW/SE and
          445AW/SE, if involving 445 AW assigned personnel, as outlined in AFMAN 91-223,
          Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 6. The AF IMT 457, USAF
          Hazard Report will be filed for runway incursions and CMAVs that did not impact
          aircraft operations. The AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), will be
          filed for all runway incursions and CMAVs that endanger the safety of an aircraft.
          6.3.1.2.3. The OSS/CC, AOF/CC, 88 ABW/SE, 445AW/SE, as applicable, and
          AAFM will work as a team to assign all runway incursions an operational category
          defined in AFI 13-213, Attachment 1 for trend analysis. The AOF/CC will ensure
          these classifications are annotated in the recommendation section of the AF IMT 457,
          or narrative section of the AF IMT 651.
          6.3.1.2.4. The AAFM and 88 AW/SE will inspect the unit ADP of the personnel who
          committed the runway incursion as a part of the investigation. Emphasis will be
          placed on how the unit trained the individual and their compliance with this
          instruction. The results will be reported to the Unit Commander.
          6.3.1.2.5. The AF IMT 651 and/or AF IMT 457 must include the following
          information in the narrative section:
              6.3.1.2.5.1. Individual’s information (e.g., rank, job title, organization, base
              assigned).

              the airfield.
              6.3.1.2.5.5. Approximate location where the CMAV occurred (e.g., runway/
              taxiway intersection, distance from threshold or overrun etc.).
      6.3.1.3. CMAV events will be briefed at the AOB.
6.4. Expired AF IMT 483s.
   6.4.1. Annual refresher training must be completed and documented NLT the last duty day
   of the month indicated on the back of the AF IMT 483. Failure to complete annual refresher
   training will result in automatic suspension of airfield driving privileges until refresher
   training is completed. Note: Personnel that were not able to complete refresher training (e.g.,
   deployed, TDY, etc.) must complete it prior to driving on the airfield.

   POV passes.
       8.2.1.1. The requests will be turned in to AM for action. If approved, AM will issue the
       POV pass for the period defined in the request, but not to exceed 31 Dec of the current
       calendar year.
       8.2.1.2. Due to the volume of traffic on the airfield, commanders must request only the
       minimum number of POV permits necessary to accomplish the mission.
       8.2.1.3. POV pass requests for contractor vehicles must be submitted by the responsible
       host Unit Commander or Company/Contractor Representative. Note: Base assigned
       contractor vehicles with permanently affixed markings (e.g., company logo) do not
       require a POV pass.
       8.2.1.4. Personnel must be qualified to drive on the airfield (possess AF IMT 483) before
       a pass is requested. If the individual is not in possession of a valid AF IMT 483, a pass
       will not be issued.
8.3. Passes.
   8.3.1. Passes must be hung from the rear view mirror or displayed on the left side of the
   dashboard so they are visible while the vehicle is on the airfield. Passes must be removed

                                   DISABLED VEHICLES

9.1. Procedures.
   9.1.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert other vehicles or taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum,
   the vehicle operator will:
      9.1.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
      9.1.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, contact Patterson Ground (via
      “Tower” LMR net), Airfield Ops (via “Base Ops” LMR net) and Maintenance Operations
      Control Center (via “MOCC” net), as applicable. State the nature of the problem and
      report your position on the airfield. Note: In the event of a radio failure/lost
      communications in the CMA, refer to paragraph 5.1.12
   9.1.2. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. Security Forces, Civil Engineer,
   Transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off of the
   airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runways.
   9.1.3. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, the operator shall stay with the
   vehicle and continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity. If
   the vehicle operator or other occupants have a cell phone, they will contact AMOPS at 937-
   257-2131.
   9.1.4. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify ATCT and AMOPS by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of the
   disabled vehicle from the CMA.
      9.1.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in the
      CMA.
      9.1.4.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using the most efficient and safe method
      possible.

Airfield— A general term encompassing the runways, taxiways, aircraft parking ramps, access,
service, and perimeter roads, hangars, and all open areas immediately adjacent to the runways,
taxiways, and aircraft parking ramps.
Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM)—An individual appointment by the Unit
Commander to administer the organization’s airfield driving program.
Airfield Management—A function that conducts airfield inspections and checks for safety and
compliance with planning and design criteria. Plans, organizes and directs airfield activities to
include airfield construction/repairs, airfield driving program, ice/snow removal operations,
Bird/Wildlife control, etc. Procures, maintains, and produces information on safe operation of
aircraft through the national and international airspace system such as Flight Information
Publications, aeronautical charts and maps, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), local airfield and
navigational aid status, and weather information. Process domestic and international flight plans.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)—A facility located near the airfield that provides
aircrews with flight plan processing and planning services.
Airfield Manager (AFM)—Works directly for the AOF/CC and manages airfield management
facilities to ensure effective support to the base flying mission and transient aircrews.
Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC)—Responsible for the overall
operation/services provided by the airfield operations flight in support of the wing flying mission
and in compliance with USAF and FAA guidelines.
Assistant Airfield Manager (AAFM)—Works directly for the AFM and serves as the Wing
ADPM to provide overall ADP management and oversight.
Controlled Area— An area in which permission from the installation commander is required
before access is granted. The airfield is considered a Controlled Area. Only personnel conducting
official military business are allowed on the airfield. All personnel driving on the airfield must
possess a valid AF IMT 483.
Controlled Movement Area— Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles, and
pedestrians to maintain two-way radio contact with the ATCT. The CMA encompasses runways,
overruns/underruns and any area within 100 feet of these areas.
Emergency Response Vehicles— Any vehicle responding to an airfield emergency (e.g. base
operations, fire department, transient alert, medical, security forces, crash recovery, or any
vehicle in direct support of saving life or limb).
Foreign Object Damage— Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system, component, tire,
munitions, or support equipment caused by a foreign object(s) which may or may not degrade the
required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned items.
General Purpose Vehicles— Vehicles of commercial design and manufacture such as pickup
trucks, sedans, vans, and electric cars/golf carts.
Government-Owned Vehicle (GOV)— Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Hazardous Air Traffic Report (AF Form 651)— Form used for any runway incursion that
endangers an airborne aircraft or an aircraft on the ground.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-213 15 AUGUST 2013                                                        57


Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Instrument Hold Lines— These markings consist of two solid yellow lines, two feet apart,
extending across the width of the taxiway, connected by pairs of solid yellow lines ten feet apart
and are used in conjunction with an instrument runway when the INST is active. This is to
protect the INST critical area so that an aircraft’s instrument reception is not disrupted while in
flight. A vehicle may not cross these lines without clearance from the Control Tower any time
the weather falls below a ceiling of 800 feet above ground level (AGL) and/or a visibility of two
statute miles and at any other time ATC deems necessary.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Patterson Ground— Air Traffic Control agency controlling aircraft and vehicles on the ground.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)— Any vehicle not owned or leased by the U.S. Government.
Contractor vehicles are treated as POVs.
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.
Runway Environment— The runway, overruns, any taxiway leading to the runway beyond the
runway hold line, or within 100 feet of the runway, including grassy areas adjacent to the
runway.
Runway Hold Line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion/Controlled Movement Area Violation— Entry by an individual, on foot or
in a vehicle, into the runway environment, as defined above, without approval from ATCT. All
runway incursions/CMAVs will be assigned an operational category (Operational Error, Pilot
Deviation or vehicle/pedestrian IAW AFI 13-213).
Runway Hold Lines— Hold lines are lines painted at least 100 feet from the runway edge. A
vehicle may not cross these lines onto a runway without clearance from ATCT. The marking
consists of two solid yellow lines (on the side where the vehicle is to wait,) and two dashed
yellow lines spaced six inches apart, spanning the width of the taxiway (including shoulders).
Service Roads— Service roads provide in-field/outfield connections to taxiways, parking
aprons, servicing areas, and facilities.

Special Purpose Vehicles— Vehicles designed and used for a specific purpose in the course of
aircraft servicing and maintenance. Forklifts, K-loaders, tugs, bobcats, multi-purpose servicing
units, etc., are included.
Taxilane—An aircraft taxi route through or along the edge of an apron is referred to as a
taxilane.
Taxiway— Taxiways connect the runways of the airfield with the parking and maintenance
areas and provide access to hangars, docks and various parking aprons and pads.
