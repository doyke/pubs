   5.2. Objective measures of performance taken over time become the basis for determining
   the level of performance within the organization.
   5.3. A systematic approach to continuous process improvement at the
   group/squadron/department/flight level is implemented by using the Air Force 8-step
   problem solving process. Consistent application of the 8-step problem solving process
   provides a concise and common format for presentation of data, problem solving facts and
   information. This facilitates benchmarking and sharing of best practices when similar
   problems arise in other areas.
   5.4. All 59 MDW personnel are trained on CPI during the initial newcomer’s orientation/in-
   processing and provided just-in-time training as necessary.
   5.5. To satisfy both Air Force and AAAHC accreditation requirements, a “crosswalk”
   between AFSO21’s 8-step problem solving process and AAAHC’s 10-step analysis was
   developed for implementing and documenting quality improvement activities.
   5.6. All quality improvement activities and/or studies for AAAHC submission will be
   documented on an A3 utilizing the “59th Medical Wing 8-Step problem solving process with
   Related Toolsets and AAAHC Crosswalk” (see Attachment 2).
   5.7. Group PIAs collaborate with squadron/department/flight PIAs to identify and update PI
   activities onto the 59 MDW CPI Tracker. The 59 MDW CPI Tracker was developed to serve
   as a repository for all PI activities throughout the wing and is located on the 59MDW
   Sharepoint           (see       below         link):               https://admin.sammc-
   eis.lackland.af.mil/59_MDSG/PIC/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
   5.8. All A3s and other supporting documents, as deemed appropriate will be uploaded to the
   59 MDW Sharepoint (see link above).

 8                                                               59MDWI90-201 7 MARCH 2013


        5.10.1. If a quality of care or patient safety concern is identified, a direct referral is made
        to one or more of the appropriate related offices, to include but not limited to the Chief of
        the Medical Staff, Chief Nurse Executive, Patient Safety, Risk Management, Medical
        Management, Credentials, Infection Control, Customer Service Flight, 59 MDW, group,
        squadron, flight, or element PI functions, or respective oversight committees IAW
        59MDWI 41-102, Medical Committees and Functional Reviews.
        5.10.2. Requests for CPI review from wing-level committees or forums are received,
        addressed, and communicated as appropriate. Other referrals may originate from
        contractors, external oversight bodies, affiliated (e.g., San Antonio Military Health
        System) and community organizations.
     5.11. The PIC, in collaboration and coordination with other wing-level committees, serves as
     a forum to prioritize process improvement opportunities as related to the organization’s
     strategic plan and its priorities.
     5.12. Opportunities to improve and lessons learned are shared IAW Title 10 United States
     Code Section 1102, Confidentiality of Medical Quality Assurance Records: Qualified
     Immunity for Participants through such avenues as newsletters, group PI, ProStaff, and wing-
     level functions and committees, as appropriate.
     5.13. AFSO21 or “Smart Ops” are terms used to describe the systematic approach to identify
     and improve upon an existing or much needed process. It embodies the relentless pursuit to

     5.14. Balanced Scorecard. The BSC tracks the 59 MDW’s organizational performance
     through a carefully selected set of key operational objectives and measures of performance
     derived from the 59 MDW's strategic plan. It represents a tool for executive leadership to
     use in evaluating outcomes and performance drivers by which the 59 MDW achieves its
     mission, vision and strategic objectives. The BSC also serves as a communication tool,
     measurement system and strategic management system striving to continually improve
     healthcare and thus processes that support healthcare. Results are briefed quarterly to the
     BOD.
     5.15. Performance Dashboard is a tracking/reporting tool for keeping the 59 MDW

#5: Data analysis that describes findings about
the frequency, severity, and source(s) of the
problem(s).
a. Carefully analyze the data you have collected.
(The complexity of the analysis you need to do will
depend on various factors, such as the amount and
type of data you have collected.)
b. Determine what the data tell you about whether
the suspected problem actually exists. If the
problem does not exist, STOP HERE. Choose
another known or suspected problem and begin
again at Step1.
c. If the problem does exist, determine what the

d. Describe how the data were analyzed, and
describe your findings (conclusions).
