SUMMARY OF CHANGES

AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 3, is supplemented as follows:

The summary of change includes Air Force Government-wide Purchase Card Program (GPC)
updates, bench stock responsibilities, and required training.

credit card (see AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-wide Purchase Card Program, for GPC

guidance). When purchasing multiple quantities of the same item through a pre-priced, approved
government contract, then GPC can be used to buy up to an extended value limit of $25,000. For
all other items with either an extended or unit cost over $2,500, prepare and submit AF Form 9,
Request for Purchase, through electronic means. Regardless of the procurement method used
(GPC or AF Form 9); all equipment requests must be coordinated through Customer Support,
Equipment Management Function to ensure proper accountability requirements are maintained.
GPC purchased hazardous materials must be pre-approved and authorized in AF-ESOHMIS.
Contact the Hazardous Materials Office (HAZMO) for assistance when the item has not
approved. Also, use GPC to purchase administrative, janitorial, and non-weapon system GSA
items. EXCEPTIONS: GSA weapon system parts identified in USAF Technical Orders, Parts
Manuals, or Illustrated Parts Breakdown are accepted. Civilian contractors are not authorized
GPC cards. They can order GSA weapon system parts if the terms of their contract allow for
GFE support. Process these issue requests (TRIC: ISU) as non-recurring (Demand Code “N”).
Base Supply will not stock or accumulate demand data nor will Base Supply accept orders for
administrative, janitorial, or non-weapon system local purchase supplies from civilian
contractors. Refer any disputes to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
3.2.1.1.1. See AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Ch 11, TAFB SUP 1 for delivery times.
3.4.3. The supported activity may assume bench stock responsibilities. When the supported
activity elects to assume bench stock management, a letter of agreement between Functional
Director, Accountable Supply Officer and organizational commanders/program managers for
each applicable bench stock will be filed in the respective bench stock account folder. In these
cases, customers will assume responsibilities outlined in paragraph 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 except for
delivering material to bench stock.
3.4.4.1. The M04, Bench Stock Review, is reviewed quarterly.

Table 3D1.1. Organizational Customers may request to assume the LRS/supply activity
organizations responsibilities. Organizational Bench Stock Monitors will attend Block IIA,
Bench Stock Management, training class.
