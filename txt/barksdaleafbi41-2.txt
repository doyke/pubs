1. SCOPE. Spontaneous Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in the United
States. SCA causes the victim to lose consciousness, stop breathing and become pulseless. SCA
victims need immediate help--waiting for emergency personnel to arrive at the scene can lead to
delays in care and reduce the chances for survival. For every minute that passes without use of
the AED, a victim’s chance of survival decreases 10 percent. The scope of training and use is
applicable to all federal employees and active duty personnel at Barksdale AFB.

         1
         Check for response (make mental note of time for
         event report). Ensure victim is unconscious and not
         breathing.
      2 Tell someone to phone emergency response (911) and
         get an AED. (If alone and a phone/AED are nearby –
         call first and get the AED) For adults – as soon as
         AED is available it should be applied to
         unconscious victim.
      3 If victim isn’t breathing or only gasping give CPR.
      4 Bare victim’s chest and locate CPR hand position
         (middle finger lined up with nipple).
      5 Begin CPR. Deliver first cycle of 30 compressions at
         a rate of 100 compressions per minute (ensure full
         chest recoil).
      6 Open the airway and give 2 breaths for 1 second each.
         Look for chest rise.
      7 Continue delivering cycles of 30 compressions and 2
         breaths until the AED is available.
         ONCE AED IS AVAILABLE
      8 Open AED cover.
      9 Tear open package and follow voice prompts to place
         pads on chest.
      10 Once AED senses that pads are in place it will begin
         to analyze victim. Follow voice prompts and do NOT
         touch the victim. If shock advised, follow prompts.
      11 Stay away from victim - verbally and visually ensure
         everyone else is clear before pressing the shock
         button.
      12 Continue the steps of CPR until the AED starts to
         analyze again (approximately 2 minutes).
     13a If shock advised, follow the prompts and ensure
         everyone is clear before pressing the shock button.
     13b If no shock is advised, follow the prompts and
         continue CPR unless signs of movement are noted.
         Continue CPR and use of AED until advanced care
