                              INQUIRIES & COMPLAINTS
                           The Inspector General (IG) Complaint Program
1. The Air Force has a good complaint system. You may file a complaint if you reasonably believe inappropriate conduct has occurred or a
violation of law, policy, procedure or regulation has been committed. You can file a complaint at any level in the IG system if you are unable
to resolve your complaint within your chain of command. No one may take reprisal action against you because you filed a complaint. If you
believe adverse action has been taken against you because of your complaint, tell an inspector or an IG.

2. The IG Complaint Program is described in AFI 90-301. The Air Force Instruction tells you how to make a complaint and who you should
talk to. You may go to an inspector or IG at any level, but experience has shown that commanders and supervisors can best solve complaints.
For this reason, you are encouraged to discuss your problem with your supervisor or your commander before coming to the IG. However,
this is not absolutely necessary.

3. Some matters are not appropriate for the IG. These are matters where an established grievance or appeal channel already exists. The table
below shows by type the reference you must use. You should always attempt to resolve matters as provided by established processes,
specific laws or regulations/instructions. This table does not list every type of complaint that is handled by other appeal channels.
