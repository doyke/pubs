     not authorized to sponsor personnel on the installation. These services may change as
     determined by threat level.
     7.3. Local taxi service companies who wish to provide frequent and recurring access to
     JBER for an extended period of time may request a JBER DBIDS card for their drivers by e-
     mailing the 673 SFS/Base Access Office (673sfs.identicard@elmendorf.af.mil). Once
     approved, the driver will present required documents and then be issued a 180-day JBER
     DBIDS pass.
     7.4. Fast food, taxi, and courtesy shuttle drivers who attempt entry without reason will be
     denied access. The event will be annotated in the JBER SFS blotter.
     7.5. The Base Access List (BAL) will be used by all 673 SFS/Base Access Office personnel
     to determine need and length of long-term passes for contractors, taxi drivers, and vendors.
     7.6. Non-Government Contract Special Service Providers are companies that provide a
     personal customer service but do not possess a government contract and must be sponsored
     in accordance with paragraph 9, this instruction. Examples of special service providers are
     pet waste removal, flower delivery and private home cleaners, and so forth. These
     companies are not eligible for a long-term pass.
8. ID Check Procedures:

     controllers will ask individuals to remove identification from their wallets and inserts.
     Installation entry controllers will not handle wallets or customers’ personal belongings.
        8.1.1. Installation entry controllers will scan all CACs, Teslin® Cards (DoD Dependent
        ID cards created in DEERS) and all DBIDS cards with the DBIDS hand-held scanner for
        entry to JBER. In the event the DBIDS system is down, installation entry controllers will

     revert to hands-on ID checks, visually assessing authenticity of credentials for access to
     JBER.
     8.1.2. During morning traffic, from 0600-0800, only scan 10 vehicles every ½ hour to
     expedite traffic. If traffic is backed up to 10 vehicles per lane, DBIDS will not be used
     until the entry controller can regain traffic flow.
  8.2. Current FPCON posture will drive ID checks on all JBER shuttle buses entering the
  base to ensure passengers are authorized on base. If an individual 16 years of age and older
  does not have identification, they must go to the nearest VCC with a valid escort to receive a
  JBER DBIDS pass or AF Form 75 prior to entry.
  8.3. Tow trucks must go to the nearest VCC to receive a JBER DBIDS pass or AF Form 75
  after coordination with their sponsor has been made or while in the company of an authorized
  escort. Tow trucks requesting access for repossession must contact the Base Defense
  Operations Center (BDOC) and will not be authorized unescorted entry, unless approved by
  on-duty Flight Chief or higher authority. Tow trucks must be escorted at all times on the
  installation.
  8.4. Share Ride Vans will be categorized as rental vehicles and will be given access as long
  as driver and passengers have a DoD ID or DBIDS pass. People Mover Buses are not

  8.5. Gas Leaks: In the event of a gas line emergency (for example, possible gas line
  break/leak), Enstar Natural Gas ® Company will notify the BDOC of the emergency
  situation and provide the number of vehicles, personnel, and the gate responding personnel
  will be entering. BDOC may contact the 773d Civil Engineer Squadron Operations Flight
  (773 CES/CEO, 552-3726) to coordinate/verify entry of Gas Utility vehicles. BDOC will
  notify affected gates and installation entry controllers will allow entry after verifying Enstar
  Natural Gas ® Company credentials when not in possession of a JBER DBIDS card or
  pass. All ¾ ton or larger vehicles are still required to be inspected prior to entry onto JBER,
  unless authorized by 673 SFS/Flight Chief or higher authority.
  8.6. When civilian news media personnel arrive unannounced, contact the BDOC to notify
  the 673 ABW/PAO. Media may use any gate as long as 673 ABW/ PAO is escorting them
  and the vehicle is not over 3/4 ton. Media vehicles exceeding 3/4 ton in weight will be
  directed to the nearest CVI to be searched. Tenant Unit PAO’s must coordinate all civilian
  news media entry with 673 ABW/PAO.
  8.7. All schools located on the installation must provide the following lists if applicable to
  the 673 SFS/Base Access Office: school staff list, Anchorage School District (ASD)
  substitute teacher list, emergency pick-up list, guest speaker list and bus driver list. These
  lists allow visitors to process through the VCC and receive a JBER DBIDS pass without a
  physical escort to minimally impact school activities. The guest speaker list must be sent to
  the 673 SFS/Base Access Office at least 1 week prior to the event for processing.
  8.8. ASD Substitute Teachers not in possession of a JBER DBIDS pass will obtain a pass to
  enter installation at the nearest VCC. Personnel working the VCC will cross-reference their
  driver’s license against the BAL. Substitute teachers will be issued a JBER DBIDS pass for
  1 day unless verified with the on-base school for up to 1 week.

  managers. Three personnel can be issued escort authority per project/job site/contract.
  Approval from 673 SFS/Plans and Programs Director is required for delegating more than
  three escort officials.
  9.15. JBER DBIDS cards are issued to contractors or employees who are considered critical
  to the 673 ABW, US Army Alaska (USARAK) or Alaska National Guard (AKNG) mission
  or ability to operate. Possession of a JBER DBIDS card does not entitle the holder to any
  Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR), AAFES or Commissary privileges.
  9.16. The contracting officer, quality assurance director or DoD representative sponsoring
  the contractors are responsible to forwarding access request lists to 673 SFS/Base Access
  Office (673sfs.identicard@elmendorf.af.mil). Base Access technicians will only issue
  passes using data from the approved list database maintained by 673 SFS/Base Access
  Office. Requests will be processed as quickly as time allows. All attempts will be made to

  card, but will not have driving privileges on the installation. “Non Driver” will be annotated
  on the remarks section of the JBER DBIDS card indicating the individual does not have a
  valid state driver’s license, or the individual’s driving privileges have been suspended or
  revoked on the installation. It will also be displayed on the DBIDS hand scanner screen
  when scanned for entry. Individuals found operating a vehicle on JBER without permission
  may be prosecuted or barred from base.
  9.20. Contractor JBER DBIDS cards will be used only for official business; misuse will
  result in confiscation of the card and possible debarment.

     the on-base sponsor on behalf of the installation populace for all vendors and taxi
     companies. Taxi companies are limited to 200 drivers bi-annually. Taxi drivers without
     a base access credential will be required to proceed to the nearest visitor control center
     for screening through NCIC and receipt of a short-term DBIDS pass or AF Form 75, not
     to exceed 1 hour.
     9.21.3. When contacted by e-mail notification, the 673 SFS/Base Access Office will
     send the sponsor a confirmation e-mail once the list has been approved.
     9.21.4. The request must include the visitor’s name, last four digits of the social security
     number, gender, date of birth, driver’s license number and state of issue, dates of visit,
     and purpose.
  9.22. All personnel listed on a “request for access” document will be subjected to a check of
  NCIC. If the check of NCIC results in potentially disqualifying information, in accordance

  all local and joint installation debarment rosters and driver suspension/revocation lists
  through use of an automated ID scanning system (for example, DBIDS) query or hard copy
  debarment and driver suspension/revocation lists. A copy of the “positive hit” results will be
  attached to any request for access document bearing the name of the individual who was the
  subject of the “hit” response and placed in the files for record.
  9.24. All personnel listed on a “request for access” document will be checked against the
  web-based central operations police suite Central Operations Police Suite (COPS)/Security
  Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) offense reporting system for potentially
  disqualifying past offense criminal history information. Any information in COPS/SFMIS
  believed to be sufficient cause for the denial of access to the installation will be forwarded to
  the servicing legal office for possible barment action. Final access determination will be
  made by the 673 ABW/ CC. A copy of potentially derogatory information will be attached
  to the request form and placed in the files for record.
  9.25. All DoD sponsors, individual vendors, taxi companies and shuttle services are required
  to notify the Base Access Office if any employee is terminated or quits prior to termination
  of their JBER DBIDS access credential. Failure to notify the Base Access Office will result
  in the loss of sponsoring privileges on JBER.

   provides dedicated and comprehensive support services to survivors of deceased soldiers.
   On JBER, the SOS program is extended to all surviving immediate family members
JBELMENDORF-RICHARDSONII31-113 7 MAY 2013                                                      21


  (grandparents, parents, brothers and sisters) of deceased military members from all branches
  of the DoD in the local community. The 673d Force Support Squadron (673 FSS) will
  provide full support to the SOS program on behalf of US Army Installation Management
  Command (IMCOM). Many survivors, including parents of deceased service members, do
  not currently possess authorized credentials for access to JBER. These family members are
  frequently required to obtain short-term passes to enter installation entry control points in
  order to use authorized facilities including Army Community Services (ACS) and the 673
  FSS/SOS office. The following procedures will be implemented in order to allow the
  issuance of long-term DBIDS passes for up to 1 year.
     14.1.1. The 673 FSS/SOS Office will identify immediate family members of deceased
     service members in the local area requiring access to JBER. The 673 FSS/SOS office
     will complete an “request for access” by e-mailing it to the 673 SFS/Base Access Office
     (673sfs.identicard@elmendorf.af.mil).
     14.1.2. Requests for access will include surviving family members full names, driver’s
     license or state ID number and last four of social security number for all members 16
     years of age and older. For family members under the age of 16 or personnel without a
     driver’s license or state ID, a date of birth must be provided along with last four of social
     security number. This information is required in order to screen all visitors to JBER
     against the NCIC. Surviving family members with derogatory information in their
     criminal history found to be a threat to the safety of the installation in accordance with
     paragraph 9.5, this instruction, will be denied long term access to the installation and
     must be escorted by an authorized DoD card holder while on the installation.
     14.1.3. All personnel listed on a request for access document will be subject to a check
     of all local and joint installation debarment rosters and driver suspension/revocation lists
     through use of an automated ID scanning system (for example, DBIDS) query or hard
     copy debarment and driver suspension/revocation lists. If barred from JBER, the SOS
     family member in question will be denied access to JBER. Barred family members may
     appeal the barment to the 673 ABW/CC through the 673 SFS/Reports and Analysis
     office.
     14.1.4. SOS family members are also subject to a screening against the web-based
     COPS/ SFMIS offense reporting system for potentially disqualifying past offense
     criminal history information. Any information in COPS/SFMIS believed to be sufficient
     cause for the denial of access to the installation will be forwarded to the servicing legal
     office for possible barment action. Final access determination will be made by the 673
     ABW/CC.
  14.2. Requests for SOS personnel will only be accepted from designated 673 FSS
  representatives with a DD Form 577 on file with the 673 SFS/Base Access Office. All
  requests must be received no later than 72 hours prior to the surviving immediate family
  members arrival.
  14.3. The 673 FSS/SOS Office will be notified by the 673 SFS/Base Access Office when the
  submitted SOS family members have been cleared to receive their DBIDS card for access to
  JBER. Once cleared, family members may proceed to the nearest VCC to receive their
  DBIDS card.

   14.4. SOS family members will be authorized access to JBER through FPCON BRAVO
   between the hours of 0700-2100, 7 days a week in order to allow access to authorized
   services on JBER. Family members will not be authorized escort authority.

SUBJECT: Fitness Determination – Denied Access to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson


1. Based upon my authority, as delegated in accordance with AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter
Access Control, you are hereby deemed unfit to enter Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for 60
days, effective immediately.
2. This unfavorable fitness determination is being initiated against you for_________________,
which is a violation of law, regulation, instruction, policy, or otherwise adversely affects the
health, safety, and/or morale of personnel on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. For this reason,
it has been determined to be in the best interest of this command and military community to
prevent you from entering this installation. I have been presented with sufficient
evidence/justification as to why you are receiving this unfavorable determination. I consider
your presence on the installation to be detrimental to the morale, good order and discipline of our
installation. In light of these circumstances, allowing you on our installation is a risk that I am
not willing to take.
3. Effective immediately, you are deemed unfit to enter Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for
the period of ______________, effective until __________. You may request rescission of this
fitness determination. Your request must be in writing, addressed to this office through the
Office of the Staff Judge Advocate. You have the burden to establish in your written request
why your presence on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson is no longer a detriment to good order
and discipline. This fitness determination remains in effect pending approval of any rescission
request you present. Further, this fitness determination and supporting documentation will be
forwarded to the installation commander for a debarment determination.
4. Should you reenter Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in violation of this determination,
without having received prior approval, you will be subject to detention by Security Forces and
delivered to the appropriate civilian and military authorities.
5. If you are entitled to medical treatment at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson medical facilities,
you may enter Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for the sole purpose of using said facilities. To
do so, you must present this letter to the entry controller at the installation visitor’s control center
and obtain an appropriate visitor’s pass. You will travel directly to the medical facility by
entering Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson through Boniface Gate, Boniface Parkway, turning

right onto Provider Dr, and taking a left onto Zeamer Ave. When your medical appointment is
completed you must depart Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson by taking Zeamer Ave, turning
right onto Provider Dr, and left onto Vandenberg Ave, exiting Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.
6. Under extraordinary circumstances, requests for temporary access to other facilities on Joint
Base Elmendorf-Richardson may be granted. Such requests must be made in advance and in
writing through the Chief of Security Forces, and must address the reasons why access should be
granted. If time does not permit (i.e., a severe illness, death of a relative), such a request must be
made to the security forces desk sergeant at 552-3421. The desk sergeant will then notify the
appropriate officials and convey your request.
7. If a compelling reason exists, which you believe should be sufficient to justify modification or
termination of this determination; you may submit your justification to the Fitness Determination
Authority, in writing, through the Reports and Analysis Section.
