1. General Description. The McDonnell Douglas MD11 is a long-range wide body cargo aircraft in the
inventory of the CRAF. There are passenger and cargo versions of the MD-11 available for military use.
The aircraft is basically an extended version of the DC-10 (see chapter 6) and provides additional cargo
capabilities. Figure 2., Figure 3. and Figure 4. provides general planning information. For additional
information, contact HQ AMC/DOF (DSN 779-2400).

Figure 1. McDonnell Douglas MD-11.




2. Passenger Seating. The MD-11 is capable of carrying upwards of 410 passengers depending on the
configuration of the aircraft and any limitations driven by local airport conditions such as weather, run-
way length etc. However the contracted number of passengers is 255. This number may be increased or
decreased by the carrier.

3. Main Deck Palletized Cargo Capability. The aircraft is capable of transporting up to 35 military pal-
lets. Figure 8. and Table 1. depicts this maximum palletized cargo capability and provides individual pal-
let weight maximums. As with the DC-10, the MD-11 also requires that adherence to cumulative shell
zone capacities be considered during pallet selection and placement. Figure 9. and Figure 10. provides
these zone load limitations. Table 1. provides this information in tabular form along with individual com-
partment location information. Figure 12. and Figure 13. depicts palletized cargo profiles for the main
deck.

4. Lower Lobe Cargo Capability. As of this publication, the Forward Lower Lobe compartments of all
MD-11s can accommodate as many as six 463L cargo pallets. Some models have a larger modified Aft
Lower Lobe Cargo Door that can accommodate four extra 463L pallets on the floor. On the models that
have the smaller doors the carrier can add five “P9” commercial pallets (60”x120”) capable of caring a

total of 1190 Cu. Ft. of bulk cargo. Figure 16. provides lower deck bulk cargo description and door size
information. NOTE: The weight of the tie downs, slings, shoring, etc., must be included with the cargo
weight when determining the maximum allowable load per each cargo hold.

5. MD-11 Freighter Package-Size Tables. Table 2. through Table 5.. provide guidance for loading
cargo on the MD-11 using the upper deck cargo door and the various lower lobe compartment doors.
Based on the width and height of the cargo (package), it is possible to determine the maximum allowable
length. The charts also permit the planner to determine either the maximum width of the cargo by consult-
ing the chart in reverse. For example, an item to be loaded throughout the forward hold door, which is 42
inches high and 228 inches long, can be loaded provided the width of the item does not exceed 48 inches.

6. Wheeled Vehicle Loads. For general planning, plan single-pallet bulk only cargo for the MD-11 air-
craft. The transport of wheeled vehicles should only be considered as a result of carrier-user coordination.

7. Loading Sequence. Load bulk designated for the forward lower lobe (FLL), then pallet position 1L
and 1R on the main deck and, finally, the remainder of the main deck from the aft section forward and the
center lower lobe (CLL) and aft bulk compartment (ABC).
NOTE: Consult the specific contracted carrier regarding the loading sequence prior to loading.

8. Placement of Hazardous Materials. Pallets containing hazardous materials identified as "cargo only
aircraft" and "dagger" type cargo must be planned for pallet positions 1L, 1R, 2L, 3L, and 4L. Pallets
placed in pallet positions 1L and 1R will have an 18-inch aisleway along the 108-inch (longitudinally
loaded) side. Aisleway will face outboard.

9. Loading Times and Crews. (See AMCP 24-2 Volume I, paragraph 2.7. for contract aircraft load
times.) Typical loading times vary greatly, depending on the experience level of the crew in loading an
MD-11. In general, the following can be used as a guideline, based on a 7-member crew working the
lower lobes and a 7-member crew working the main deck.


Reconfigure main deck pallet locks (as required)    + 55 to 1        +   05
Install main deck subfloor                          + 40 to 1        +   05
Load main deck                                      1 + 30 to        2   + 30
Hand load lower lobe baggage*                       + 50 to 1        +   30
*Lower lobe normally is loaded concurrently with main deck.

10. General Rules. Some of the rules have been discussed in previous paragraphs; however, this list is
given as a guide:
    10.1. All cargo must be loaded over and placed on a subfloor, preferably military pallets.
    10.2. Wooden shoring at least 2 inches thick may be use in between pallets or as a subfloor.
    10.3. ACL includes pallet and tie-down weights figured at 354 pounds per pallet (290 pounds per pal-
    let, 64 pounds for tie-down chains and devices).
    10.4. A 60K Loader or wide-body elevator loader is needed for main deck cargo onload and off-load.
AMCPAM24-2V8 1 DECEMBER 2001                                                                          5


  10.5. All cargo loaded on 463L pallets is limited to 250 pounds per square inch and is also restricted
  to the maximum pallet weight according to Figure 8.
  10.6. Determining weight limits is a four-step process:
     10.6.1. Ensure individual pallet weights are within limits.
     10.6.2. Ensure combined weight of lateral pallets and lower lobe cargo within the pallet position
     zone does not exceed total allowable zone load weight.
     10.6.3. Ensure zone limits are not exceeded (Figure 9.).

Figure 10. MD-11 Shell Zone Load Example Computations.




11. Zone Load Computations. In order to keep from bending the fuselage, the maximum cargo weight
forward and aft of the wings must be considered when load planning. Zone Load Limits have been estab-
lished to prevent this from happening. In the example in Figure 9. above, Zone A has a total of 11,000
pounds between the two pallets in Pallet positions 1L and 1R. There is no cargo in the Lower Lobes
directly below 1L and 1R so the total weight in Zone A is 11,000 lbs. Pallet positions 2L and 2R have a
total of 10,000 lbs. on the main floor with an additional 4,000 lbs. in the Lower Lobe directly below it.
This 14,000 lbs. (10,000 plus 4,000) is added to the accumulated weight from zone A which totals 25,000
lbs. that is forward of sta. 620.5 (zone B). The limit for zone B is 26,000 lbs. so the load plan is within
limits. However, when cargo is loaded in pallet positions 3L and 3R (11,000 lbs.) and the lower lobe
directly below it (6,000 lbs.), the accumulated weight is 42,000 lbs. The zone limit for zone C is 38,000
lbs. At this point the load plan must be changed to fall within zone limits.
NOTE: It is possible to load the individual pallets to their maximum limits and exceed the zone limits.
Both limitations must be considered.

NOTES:
  1. The Arm of each pallet is the same as the centroid of its compartment.
     2. L (left) or R (right) is for bulk cargo in that half of the compartment with respect to the airplane
        centerline.
     3. The maximum pallet load is subject to missing and/or inoperative restraint limitations.
     4. Sum of the load in this compartment plus loads in compartments aft (main cabin plus lower cargo
        compartment) must not exceed shell zone allowable shown for compartment.
     5. Total weight of pallets, containers, and payload in each compartment must not exceed Compart-
        ment Placarded Capacity.
AMCPAM24-2V8 1 DECEMBER 2001                                                                        15


   6. Weight of galley, galley contents, pallets, and containers must be considered as payload for com-
      puting shell zone allowable capacity for comparison with this table.
   7. Sum of load in compartments 9, 10 and 11 must not exceed shell zone compartment allowables.
   8. Sum of the load in this compartment plus loads in compartments forward (main cabin plus lower
      cargo compartment) must not exceed shell zone allowable shown for compartment.

                          MD-11 FREIGHTER PACKAGE SIZE TABLES
The following package charts can be used to determine whether a package can fit in a specific compart-
ment based on the restrictions imposed by the cargo door and compartment size.
Lengths are determined for packages in contact with the top of rollers in the cargo loading system. Tilt-
ing, twisting, bending and/or rotating packages through door opening will allow additional lengths in
many cases, but these should be determined for special situations depending on allowable conditions.
Loading bulk cargo into this hold will require the exclusion of some or all containers.
The table below shows the maximum length in inches for the given height and width.

NOTE: This chart is based upon storing packages in the small (126 inch long)
aft hold after loading through the center hold door. This requires that a hold
separator be installed after loading any packages exceeding the size of those
which can be loaded through the 30" W x 36" H door.
   Many sizes listed must be positioned diagonally or crosswise on the floor
    because of ceiling height limitations or compartment length limitations.
