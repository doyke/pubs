SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Deletes references to SG memo. This information is now published in AFI 48-123 Vol
3_AFMCSUP; Medical Examinations and Standards Volume3- Flying and Special Operational
Duty. Adds the AFMC/A3V memo at Attachment 12 for use of Service Guidance. Provides
guidance on completion of the AFMC Form 73 signature levels, para 2.2.3.
1.34.1. (AFMC-Added) When justified, Non-crewmembers may fly periodically in the following
status: Maintenance/Engineering Support Personnel (MESP), an individual whose particular
expertise is required inflight to provide assistance with or observation of test techniques, data
collection, systems operation, support resource or crew procedures.              (Ref: AFI 11-
401_AFMCSUP for guidance).
1.34.2. (AFMC-Added)Non-crewmembers in MESP status must comply with FAA Class III or
higher requirements. Physiological training requirements will be IAW AFI 48-123 Vol 3,
AFMCSUP, Medical Examinations and Standards Volume3- Flying and Special Operational
Duty,
1.40. (AFMC) See AFMC/A3V memo dated 24 Aug 2006 for additional guidance and
clarification on the use of Service Guidance in the development of Contractor Procedures.
(Attachment 12)
1.40.1. (AFMC) AFMC/A3V is the OPR for the three-volume set of Flight Test (FT) instructions
containing attachments for each weapon system flown in AFMC. These instructions are
numbered AFI 11-2FT Volume 1, 2, and 3, and will contain the training, evaluation criteria, and
operations procedures, respectively, for each weapon system. AFMC uses these instructions in
lieu of AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes for flying operations. In the absence of published
guidance AFMC units will coordinate with HQ AFMC/A3V for approval of locally developed
guidelines. These guidelines should be consistent with similar guidance specified in the
appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific volumes. In addition, aircraft on loan to AFMC undergoing
short-term flight test programs will be flown according to the lead MAJCOM guidance if no
AFMC AFI 11-2FT-series or other guidance exists.
2.2.2. (AFMC) To expedite the waiver process, contractors should document/submit waiver
requests on an AFMC Form 73.
2.2.3. (AFMC) If the AFMC Form 73 is used, the GFR will be listed as the Action Officer in
Section 1. Submission of the waiver package will deem GFR concurrence with the contractor
waiver request. The CMO/CC, if a rated officer, will electronically sign Section I, in the OG/CC
block. If the CMO/CC is not a rated officer, forward the waiver request to DCMA-AO for
signature. Service GFR waiver requests will be signed by the OG/CC providing oversight of
contractor operations.
2.5.2. (AFMC) Waiver authority approval for Service guidance waivers and waivers to this
instruction will be forwarded to AFMC/A3V for coordination. AFMC/A3 delegates waiver
approval authority to AFMC/A3V where applicable and in alignment with Service and
MAJCOM guidance delegated approval authority for AFMC possessed flight operations.
Waivers to AFI 10-220 or Service Guidance will be issued with a one year expiration date. Once
the need for the waiver has been re-validated, send a renewal request to AFMC/A3V for
AFI10-220(I)_AFMCSUP 6 NOVEMBER 2008                                                        3

coordination/approval. Service Guidance waiver requests may be approved by the CMO/CC (if
the governing publication waiver authority is listed as OG/CC) if the CMO/CC is a rated officer.
If not, forward waiver requests as stated in para 2.2.3. above.
3.4. (AFMC) Use of Service Guidance. See AFMC/A3V memo dated 24 Aug 2006 for
additional guidance and clarification on the use of Service Guidance in the development of
Contractor Procedures. (Attachment 12)

request from the contractor for formal training (AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools) to the
GFR. It must be endorsed by the ACO, showing that the contract cost adjustment has been made
or is not required.
4.3.5.2. (AFMC) Non-crewmembers authorized to fly in MESP status by the GFR, will comply
with physical/medical requirements referenced in AFI 48-123 Vol 3, AFMCSUP1, Medical
Examinations and Standards Volume3- Flying and Special Operational Duty, and AFI 11-
401/_AFMCSUP, Aviation Management.

4.5.4. (AFMC) Contractors may request multiple aircraft qualification through the GFR to the
appropriate approval authority. Qualification in other than Government aircraft do not constitute
a multiple qualification and do not require approval as listed in paragraph 4.5.4.2.
4.5.4.2. (AFMC) Qualification in multiple variants of the same MD (series or modified mission
as defined in paragraph 1.3 ) does not constitute multiple qualification. GFRs may authorize
contractor crewmembers to maintain qualification in three or more series/modified mission

7.1. (AFMC) Send copy of Government Flight Representative (GFR) designation letter (primary
and alternate) to HQ AFMC/A3V. Contact HQ DCMA-AO directly (info HQ AFMC/A3V) to
schedule newly appointed GFR (primary and alternate) for the formal GFR training course
conducted by HQ DCMA Aircraft Operations. Send requests to Mr John Heib, DCMA-AO
Policy and Training Director, e-mail: john.heib@dcma.mil. Although there is no cost for the

Duty.
7.4.10. (AFMC-Added) AFMC is the lead MAJCOM for GFR operations within the USAF. In
order to accurately capture the scope of contractor operations across the Air Force, all GFRs
assigned to Air Force contracts will submit annually, in January, a GFR Data Sheet to HQ
AFMC/A3V. Use the format at (Attachment 13).
7.7.6. (AFMC) Units with joint contractor/Government operations, the GFR and the local Stan

AFMC/A3 to conduct inspections, evaluations and staff assistance visits on units that conduct
flying operations in support of AFMC. AFMC/A3V will evaluate each unit approximately once
every 24 months and conduct staff assistance visits every 12 months. Compliance verification
with USAF, AFMC, unit guidance, and contractor procedures is one objective of this program
with the additional and more critical objective to evaluate aircrew performance in the conduct of
their mission. AFMC/A3V will provide unit oversight IAW AFMCI 90-203, Aircrew
Performance Evaluation, Staff Assistance Visit, and Inspection Program.

qualifications. Cancel those no longer required for mission accomplishment. GFRs should
document this review with initials and date on each AFMC Form 80, Multiple Qualification
Request and Authorization. Forward a copy of the reviewed/re-validated AFMC Form 80, to
AFMC/A3V for compilation into the command level annual report.
7.8.6.1. (AFMC-Added) GFRs will designate a primary aircraft for multiple qualified aircrews.
