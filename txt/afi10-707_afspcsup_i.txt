1. Air Force Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program. CJCSI 3320.02B states DOD
components will attempt to resolve interference affecting systems under their auspices at the lowest level
possible within their chain of command. The AFSIR program pertains to Air Force units experiencing
interference at any time except when under the operational control of a Combatant Command. MAJ-
COMs with units located outside of the continental United States may report and resolve interference in
accordance with geographical Unified Command procedures and can request AFFMA or QFIRC assis-
tance, if needed. Report any Air Force interference experienced while supporting joint operations in
accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command procedures. Report interference to space sys-
tems, including space, ground, and control segments to your MAJCOM, in accordance with Air Force
Space Command (AFSPC) supplemental guidance. The focus of the AFSIR program is to resolve EMI at
the lowest organizational level. Submit all reports, initial, follow-on, and closure through the MAJCOM
to AFFMA.
    1.1. (Added-AFSPC) (For OCONUS AFSPC Mission-System Units) For AFSPC units under con-
    trol of Unified Commands outside the U.S. include the following SIPRNET address elements in your
    Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) reports:
       AFSPC.CommandCenter@AFSPC.AF.Smil.Mil
       AFSPC.A6NII@AFSPC.AF.Smil.Mil
       USSTRATCOMGlobalSpectrumManagement@Stratnets.Stratcom.Smil.Mil
       JSPOCCombatOpsv3@Vandenberg.AF.Smil.Mil
       RSSC-EUR@EUR.DISA.Smil.Mil (for EUCOM locations)
       RSSC-PAC@PAC.DISA.Smil.Mil (for PACOM locations)

2. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). EMI can be caused by enemy, neutral, friendly, or natural
sources, and must be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Users must investigate and report as outlined in
paragraph 3.
    2.1. EMI from DOD Users. When the EMI clearly results from another DOD user, attempt to resolve
    the interference at the lowest organizational level. After all local efforts have been exhausted to
    resolve the EMI, request assistance through command frequency management channels.
    2.2. EMI from Non-DOD Users. Request assistance through command frequency management chan-
    nels. Do not go directly to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any other agency. Air
    Force-owned equipment may cause EMI that appears to originate from a nongovernment source.
    AFFMA personnel will coordinate with the FCC and other government agencies if the investigation
    shows that non-Air Force equipment caused the EMI.
    2.3. EMI from suspected hostile sources. The primary difference between hostile and nonhostile
    EMI is intention. All incidents should initially be treated as nonhostile EMI until proven otherwise.
    2.3. (AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) Unless the source of an EMI to AFSPC mission
    systems is known, it will be treated with a sense of urgency. Mission systems for the purpose of this
    supplement, are systems/equipment in direct support of AFSPC missions, i.e. Air Force Satellite Con-
    trol Network (AFSCN), Missile Warning Systems, Missile Fields, etc. and operate 24/7. Urgency is
    required until it is reasonably certain the interference is not the result of hostile or otherwise inten-
    tional activity. While the majority of the interference events are non-hostile, it is not the role of an
AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP_I 17 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                  5


   operator to determine if an EMI is hostile or not. IAW United States Strategic Command’s
   (USSTRATCOM) Strategic Directive (SD) 710-4, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Electro-
   magnetic Interference (EMI) Resolution Procedures, the Commander USSTRATCOM will make
   the hostile/non-hostile decision based on information provided from several sources including CDR
   (Commander) AFSPC, Director (DIR) Global SatCom (Satellite Communications) Support Center
   (GSSC), DIR Regional SatCom Support Center (RSSC), and CDR Joint Space Operations (JSO).
      2.3.1. EMI from hostile sources should be reported to the Joint Spectrum Center (JSC) in accor-
      dance with CJCSI 3320.02A-1 (Secret) and by MAJCOMs in accordance with AFPD 10-20, Air
      Force Defensive Counterinformation Operations. Report any hostile interference experienced
      while supporting joint operations in accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command
      procedures. Report Military Satellite Communications incidents to US Strategic Command in
      accordance with AFSPC supplemental guidance.
      2.3.1. (AFSPC) (For all MAJCOMs and their units within the CONUS) AFI 10-707 directs all
      MAJCOMs to utilize this supplement to address EMIs to any node of a space system. CJCSM
      3320.02, Joint Spectrum Interference Resolution (JSIR) Procedures, and the Unified Command
      Plan, 1 Mar 2005, assigns USSTRATCOM as the focal point for all incidents of interference and
      electromagnetic attack affecting DoD space systems. Only paragraphs 2.3.1., 3.6.3. and 7.1.
      (Added) in this supplement apply to all MAJCOMs for space system interference reporting.
      USSTRATCOM’s (RSSC) must be included in all reports of space system EMIs. The RSSC for
      the CONUS is located at Mac Dill AFB FL and can be contacted at DSN 968-6845. The SIPRNET
      address is: RSSC@MACDILL.AF.Smil.Mil The SD 710-4 requires submission of initial EMI
      reports within 72 hours from when the suspected EMI was first noticed. For outside CONUS,
      COCOMs will have contact information for their RSSC locations.

3. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Resolution.
   3.1. The victim of the interference contacts the local installation spectrum manager (ISM) or other
   point of contact identified by the MAJCOM. Accomplish the following actions prior to requesting
   assistance from the MAJCOM spectrum manager.
      3.1.1. System operator will contact equipment maintenance personnel to determine if the EMI is
      the result of maintenance actions or an equipment malfunction.
      3.1.2. System operator will contact other known nearby units to ascertain if they are experiencing
      the same type of EMI. This may aid in identifying the interference source.
      3.1.3. When co-channel interference (interference between systems assigned similar frequency
      assignments) is suspected, the ISM will attempt to determine the location of frequency assign-
      ments that fall within the bandwidth of the victim receiver.
      3.1.4. If resources are available, system operations and equipment maintenance personnel will
      attempt to determine the bandwidth, relative amplitude, and modulation of the EMI with a spec-
      trum analyzer. Find the approximate bandwidth by varying the receiver frequency to determine
      the affected frequency band.
      3.1.5. If a non-Air Force activity reports suspected interference from an Air Force asset, the vic-
      tim experiencing EMI must collect the related information. The ISM or MAJCOM designated
      point of contact will attempt to resolve the EMI.

    3.1.6. After exhausting all local resolution efforts, the ISM or MAJCOM designated point of con-
    tact can contact the 738th Engineering Installation Squadron (EIS) located at Keesler AFB MS,
    directly for an initial assessment of the problem, obtain consultation, and recommendations
    regarding actions, coordination and techniques that can be used to identify the source and resolve
    the EMI.
    3.1.7. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) EMI reporting by AFSPC Wings
    and units experiencing mission-system interference (including interferences affecting critical sup-
    port functions such as maintenance or security) begins with the operator who is experiencing the
    interference. Reports are to be addressed to JSpOC and HQ AFSPC Command Center through the
    host-wing Command Post via SIPRNET. When sending EMI reports, process them using the
    “Importance: High” (!) flag on your personal computer. Formats are provided for each AFSPC
    mission system (Attachment 3 (Added) through Attachment 8 (Added)), which specifies
    required information and provides address elements to submit reports. Reporting information for
    the AFSCN is found in Attachment 3 (Added); for the Satellite Read-out Stations (SRS), see
    Attachment 4 (Added); for AFSPC radars see Attachment 5 (Added); for AFSPC ranges, see
    Attachment 6 (Added); for missile fields see Attachment 7 (Added); for all others see Attach-
    ment 8 (Added). Also see Figure 1. (Added) for the EMI reporting chain.

           3.1.7.1. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) The AFSPC Command SMO
           is on-call to respond to all mission system EMI reports 24/7. Reporting times are two hours
           from initial EMI indication to its Wing Command Post. For Wing Command Posts, one hour
           has been established for release of an official report to JSpOC and the AFSPC Command Cen-
           ter. A total of three hours is allotted from the initial indication of an EMI to the release of the
           initial report to JSpOC and AFSPC Command Center. Submit reports within the time criteria,
           even if local investigation of the EMI is not complete and submit follow-up reports using the
           same addressees for any changes to the initial report. Local processes should be in place and
           used to determine if an EMI indication is a result of equipment anomaly, space weather, sched-
           uling, outside sources, etc.
           3.1.7.2. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) HQ AFSPC Command SMO
           will complete a formal JSIR report in accordance with CJCSM 3320.02A, for AFSPC units
           that report EMIs using the SIRF format described in Attachment 3 (Added) through Attach-
           ment 8 (Added).
           3.1.7.3. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) The JSpOC will monitor the
           EMI reports from the wings to the AFSPC Command Center for mission impact and to assist
           with information flow within the established timelines.
       3.1.8. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Units) All other wireless systems not in direct support of
       AFSPC mission systems (24/7), such as LMRs (except for missile fields in support of operations),
       and program management tests, should report their EMIs through their frequency management
       offices by the end of the next duty day and process via routine channels.
       3.1.9. (Added-AFSPC) (For AFSPC Mission-System Units) Identification of severity of mission
       impact, in items 6 & 7 of Attachment 3 (Added) through Attachment 8 (Added), might provide
       additional resources to resolve EMIs. The three degrees of mission impacts are: minimal, signifi-
       cant, and severe and are defined in Attachment 1, “terms.”
    3.2. If resolution is not obtained in accordance with paragraph 3.1., the ISM or MAJCOM designated
    point of contact will request assistance from the MAJCOM spectrum manager. The MAJCOM spec-
    trum manager should use any additional information and tools available to resolve the EMI and should
    request a report as outlined in paragraph 3.6.
    3.3. If the MAJCOM spectrum manager cannot resolve the EMI, request assistance from AFFMA.
    AFFMA will attempt to first coordinate resolution with the MAJCOM and 738 EIS.
    3.4. If resolution is not achieved in accordance with paragraph 3.3., a QFIRC may be required. Coor-
    dinate approval between AFFMA, MAJCOM, and 738 EIS prior to deployment of the QFIRC.
    3.5. AFFMA can also request national-level federal agency and/or JSC support, as appropriate.
    3.6. EMI Reporting:
       3.6.1. Report Precedence. The ISM or MAJCOM designated point of contact and MAJCOM
       Spectrum Management Office will determine precedence consistent with the urgency of the
       reported situation.
       3.6.2. Security Classification of EMI Reports. Units must evaluate the security sensitivity of the
       EMI on the affected system and classify the report accordingly. Security classification of interfer-
       ence incidents/reports is determined principally by nationality and location of the implied or stated
AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP_I 17 NOVEMBER 2006                                                                  9


     source of the interference and the security sensitivity of the affected military system. Stations
     located in combat areas or having a sensitive military mission generally must classify all interfer-
     ence reports. Guidelines for classifying interference incidents are contained in CJCSI 3320.02B.
     3.6.2. (AFSPC) (For AFSPC Units) The classification of the report is determined by the mission
     system’s Security Classification Guide (SCG). If, however, the interference indicates a vulnerabil-
     ity, or is not identified in the SCG, classify the report in accordance with CJCSI 3320.02C, Joint
     Spectrum Interference Resolution (JSIR), Attachment 9 (Added) of this supplement.
     3.6.3. Report Format. Submit an AFSIR report by electronic means (preferably E-mail). The
     Spectrum XXI [SXXI] Interference Resolution module is a tool that can be used for this purpose.
     Interference reports sent by MAJCOMs will be courtesy copied to the JSC J3 as an information
     addressee for historical record keeping purposes. See Attachment 2 for a sample interference
     report.
     3.6.3. (AFSPC) (For all MAJCOMs and their units within CONUS) For space system EMIs, sub-
     mit report in the JSIR format IAW CJCSM 3320.02A. See paragraph 7.1. (Added).
     3.6.4. Types of Reports.
        3.6.4.1. Initial Report. The ISM or MAJCOM designated point of contact will generate a
        report.
        3.6.4.2. Supplemental or Follow-on Reports. Submit supplemental reports when needed to

        at top and bottom of the report and will terminated at the AFSPC Command Spectrum Manage-
        ment Office, and be reviewed to determine if further information is needed in a follow-on AFSPC
        Supplement. SIPRNET address element for these reports as a minimum should be,
        AFSPC.A6NII@AFSPC.AF.Smil.Mil.
        3.6.7. Exceptions to Reporting. Do not report an incident when:
            3.6.7.1. The interference is transient EMI from natural sources (e.g., rain, lightning, etc.).
            3.6.7.2. The interference only affects training frequencies assigned on a noninterference basis
            for training purposes.
            3.6.7.3. Space weather (e.g., HF fades, Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) events, geomagnetic
            storming, etc.) is the suspected, or confirmed, cause of the interference. For assistance, notify
            the local weather unit of the EMI to include date, time, location, system, and frequency
            impacts. The local weather unit can contact the Air Force Weather Agency, as appropriate.
            3.6.7.4. The interference is only experienced aboard intelligence, surveillance and reconnais-
            sance (ISR) aircraft aloft and is localized when mission equipment or payload equipment is
            turned on/off or used. In these cases, the interference must be reported to the flying unit's
            Director of Maintenance/Maintenance Officer and Director of Operations. The unit's Director
            of Maintenance/Maintenance Officer may report the EMI to AFMC; the flying unit's Director
            of Operations must characterize the operational impact. The unit's Director of Maintenance/
            Maintenance Officer must determine if unit maintenance or calibration will resolve the EMI
            before notifying AFMC. If notified, AFMC must determine if any field or depot upgrades
            meant to resolve the EMI are already scheduled. AFMC is responsible for reporting the EMI
            to AFFMA if the EMI can be detected at a distance of more than 50 meters from the aircraft.

Electromagnetic environmental effects (E3)—The impact of the electromagnetic environment upon the
operational capability of military forces, equipment, systems, and platforms. It encompasses all
electromagnetic disciplines, including electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference;
electromagnetic vulnerability; electromagnetic pulse; electronic protection, hazards of electromagnetic
radiation to personnel, ordnance, and volatile materials; and natural phenomena effects of lightning and
precipitation static. (Joint Publication [JP 1-02])
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)—The ability of systems, equipment, and devices that utilize the
electromagnetic spectrum to operate in their intended operational environments without suffering
unacceptable degradation or causing unintentional degradation because of electromagnetic radiation or
response. It involves the application of sound electromagnetic spectrum management; system,
equipment, and device design configuration that ensures interference-free operation; and clear concepts
and doctrines that maximize operational effectiveness. (JP 1-02)
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)—Any electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or
otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics and electrical equipment. It can be
induced intentionally, as in some forms of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious
emissions and responses, intermodulation products, and the like. (JP 1-02)

                            JSIR SECURITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDE
A9.1. (Added-AFSPC) Security classification of interference incidents/reports is determined principally
by nationality and location of the implied or stated source of the interference and the security sensitivity
of the affected military system. Stations located in combat areas or having a sensitive military mission
generally must classify all interference reports. The following are guidelines for classifying interference
incidents and reports:
   A9.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) The specific identification of an unfriendly platform or location by country
   or coordinates as the source of interference or electronic attack will be classified as SECRET. Reason:
   1.5.c, Declassify on: X1.
   A9.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Specific susceptibility or vulnerability of US electronic equipment/systems
   will be classified at a minimum level of SECRET. Reason: 1.5(g), Declassify on: X3. The classifica-
   tion guide for the affected system should be consulted for specific guidance.
   A9.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Parametric data of classified US electronic equipment/systems will be
   classified in accordance with the classification guide for the equipment affected. Classify correspon-
   dence equal to the security category assigned the affected system.
   A9.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) Suspected interference from unidentified sources while operating near hos-
   tile countries will be classified SECRET. Reason: 1.5(g), Declassify: 10 years from date of incident.
   A9.1.5. (Added-AFSPC) Interference to US electromagnetic equipment/systems caused by EA exer-
   cises in foreign nations will be classified as CONFIDENTIAL. Reason: 1.5(g), Declassify on: X5.
   A9.1.6. (Added-AFSPC) Suspected interference from friendly sources will be treated as UNCLAS-
   SIFIED unless it reveals a specific system vulnerability, in which case it will be classified at a mini-
   mum level of SECRET. Reason: 1.5(g), Declassify on: X3.
   A9.1.7. (Added-AFSPC) Suspected interference from unknown sources will be classified at a mini-
   mum level of CONFIDENTIAL. The classification guide for the affected system should be consulted
   for specific guidance.
   A9.1.8. (Added-AFSPC) When referring to JSIR and stating that JSIR analyses are a function of the
   JSC, reports will be UNCLASSIFIED.
