1. PURPOSE.
   1.1. Purpose. The AFL2P exists to enhance readiness and improve combat capability by
   capitalizing on the experiences of Airmen. A Lesson Learned (L2) is an Observation that,
   when validated and resolved, results in an improvement in military operations or activities at
   the strategic, operational, or tactical level and results in long-term, internalized change to an
   individual or an organization. Coupling L2 with past experiences should also assist senior
   leaders in programming, budgeting and allocating resources as well as making changes to
   doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities and
   policy (DOTMLPF&P). An L2 finding is not a compliance “report card” nor is it
   automatically accepted and implemented without the scrutiny of functional experts. An L2 is
   also not “owned” by any one organization. Rather, the mandate for all organizations
   participating in the AFL2P is to coordinate activities and collaboratively exchange
   Observations and Lessons Identified for the benefit of the total Air Force mission.
   1.2. Air Force Lessons Process (AFLP).
       1.2.1. The role of the AFLP is to facilitate the learning of Lessons identified across the
       Air Force. The AFLP has four fundamental components: Collection, Validation,
       Dissemination and Resolution. Figure 1.1 depicts the AFLP.
 4                                             AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012


Figure 1. 1 Air Force Lessons Process (AFLP).
      1.2.2. Collection is the method by which Observations initially enter the AFLP.
      Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection efforts or they
      can be “pushed” into the process by organizations, units and individuals. In a learning
      culture, every Airman, AF civilian and contractor can contribute to the AFLP.
      1.2.3. Validation consists of review by staff functionals and/or operational expert to
      confirm an Observation has identifiable lessons to be processed through the AFLP. Once
      validated, an Observation is a Lesson Identified and represents a matter (e.g., capability,
      concept, process, procedure) to be sustained, improved or developed. A Lesson
      Identified contains a better way to accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader
      community.
      1.2.4. Dissemination is the distribution of Lessons Identified to organizations for action,
      along with making lessons available for wider use. The aim of dissemination is to get
      lessons to decision makers and Airmen in time for them to make more informed
      decisions.
      1.2.5. In Resolution, Lessons Identified are addressed to ensure they become Lessons
      Learned and are not forgotten or ignored. Resolution ensures they are staffed for action
      (DOTMLPF&P changed), captured in JLLIS (or appropriate documents) and tracked to
      closure. Tracking Lessons Identified is a process that occurs throughout the life cycle of
      a validated Observation.
      1.2.6. Each L2 office will establish procedures to monitor the status of Lessons
      Identified and actions taken by Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPRs). The
      monitoring office will ensure periodic updates are annotated in JLLIS. Until
      DOTMLPF&P changes from a Lesson Identified are implemented and become a Lesson
      Learned, OPRs and L2 offices should observe corrective actions and be vigilant for
      similar repeat Observations.
      1.2.7. The L2 process is not intended to bypass the chain of command. A structured
      process is in place to review Observations by appropriate JLLIS Tier Managers and
      functional subject matter experts (SMEs).
      1.2.8. Due to their different mission and responsibilities, L2 functions will not be
      combined in the same office with Historians (HO) and/or Inspector General (IG) and/or
      standardization and evaluation (stan/eval) functions. Whereas the IG and stan/eval
      functions are tasked to provide an objective “report card” on organizational compliance,
      L2 functions are collaborative partnerships to capture and share lessons. For similar
      reasons, the L2 program will not be combined with the Safety function at any echelon.
      However, Lessons Identified in both IG and Safety functions should, when possible, be
      sent to the AF L2 Community. In addition, the History function will not be combined
      with the L2 program as historical documentation encompasses operational, maintenance,
      agile combat support and various other command functions. Common source data
      (interviews, AARs, etc.) should be shared between the L2 and HO communities.

     1.2.9. In accordance with CJCSI 3150.25D, Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP),
     JLLIS is the system of record for the Department of Defense and the JLLP. As such,
     Observations and Lessons Identified will ultimately reside in the JLLIS database to the
     maximum extent feasible. To ensure maximum sharing of L2s, JLLIS must be the
     primary vehicle used to implement the AFLP.

             2.2.4.3.6. (Added-AFISRA) Develop and deliver awareness training to provide
             unit staff with a basic understanding of the AFL2P and AF JLLIS.
  2.3. All Airmen.
     2.3.1. All Airmen are encouraged to enter Observations that contain potential lessons
     into JLLIS for coordination through the AFLP and/or inform the local chain of command
     as appropriate.
     2.3.2. Individuals or organizations lacking access to the JLLIS website may use AF IMT
     Forms 4329 and 4330 (Attachments 3 and 4) to record their Observations and e-mail
     them directly to the appropriate NAF, MAJCOM, or HQ USAF-level L2 office. Both
     forms are avaliable online at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
3. COLLECTION.
  3.1. Purpose. Collection is the method by which Observations initially enter the AFLP.
  Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection efforts or they can be
  “pushed” into the process by organizations, units and individuals. In a learning culture,
  every Airman, AF civilian and contractor can contribute to the AFLP.
  3.2. Types of Collections.
     3.2.1. After action collection to capture important events. Reconstructs specific events or
     combat operations after the fact to gain a better understanding of the event‟s successes
     and challenges. AFLP allows an organization to capture historical events and share
     lessons gained from participants‟ knowledge and experience, even though the Lessons
     Identified may already be resolved and no further actions are required. This can be done
     in partnership with historians but is not intended to duplicate their work.
10                                             AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012


     3.2.2. Event collection. Captures the facts and participant Observations regarding a
     combat or non-combat event as it occurs. The collection can occur at the strategic,
     operational, and/or tactical level. Examples include exercises, such as RED FLAG, or
     contingencies, such as Hurricane Katrina or Operation UNIFIED ASSISTANCE. Event
     collections may be accomplished two ways:
         3.2.2.1. Participative collection. The L2 staff performs two roles during the event.
         First, they participate in the unit‟s operational battle rhythm, attend staff meetings,
         man the Crisis Action Team and/or provide real-time inputs to the commander‟s
         planning and decision process. Second, the staff forms teams to collect data at the
         tactical, operational and/or strategic levels. Large-scale operations, such as disaster
         relief operations, might involve teams from HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, NAFs, other
         Services and UCCs collecting data either independently or in concert based on goals.
         3.2.2.2. Observational collection. An L2 team records the organizational structures,
         processes and resources used to accomplish an infrequent, noncombat event so that
         tacit knowledge gained during the event can be explicitly documented, stored and
         retrieved for later use during similar events (e.g., Quadrennial Defense Review
         [QDR] Process).
     3.2.3. Topical collection. This collection focuses on a specific subject or cyclic process
     (e.g., surveys, Focus Areas, etal) based on an L2 organization‟s desire to further examine
     or collect information about a certain topic.
     3.2.4. Observations and Lessons Identified through event collections and topical
     collections will be entered into JLLIS for validation, dissemination and resolution. JLLIS
     is the system of record for the AF L2 process and may be used by any Airman. JLLIS is
     the central repository for Observations, Lessons Identified, AARs and other L2 reports.
  3.3. Techniques and Tools. L2 collections can employ the full range of techniques and
  tools, tailoring them to the specific situation. Techniques and tools include direct
  observation, in-person interviews, commanders‟ exit interviews, surveys, database
  submissions by participants, AARs, data and database mining and document capturing.
  Sharing of data between L2 professionals, historians and other learning organizations is
  highly encouraged to coordinate on collection dissemination, especially via the JLLIS online
  database.
  3.4. General L2 Collection Approach.
     3.4.1. When possible, collections should be coordinated in advance with involvement of
     trained L2 staff. Collections on many important events (warfare, contingencies, etc.) are
     often conducted with little or no notice. Individuals must be trained on collection
     techniques and prepared to apply them at any time.
     3.4.2. Where possible, an L2 collection within an organization‟s Area of Responsibility
     (AOR) should be augmented as required by other L2 offices and SMEs. For most
     collections, SMEs and functional area experts are better suited to observe and document
     employment of their respective processes.
AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012                                                         11


     3.4.3. The L2 office (at any level) will normally lead collection efforts. AF/A9L
     participation with other L2 organizations in CSAF-directed/multi-service/joint collections
     permits better access senior leadership and documents broader perspectives.
  3.5. Observation Submission Procedures.
     3.5.1. AFLP procedures standardize Observation submission and management at all AF
     echelons. Observation submission procedures consist of collecting Observations of
     events and operations, reviewing and entering them in JLLIS. Lower echelons will
     address Observations at their level and forward those beyond their scope to the
     appropriate level.
     3.5.2. Observation submission procedures apply to all units either conducting their day-
     to-day mission or participating in real world operations and/or exercises (e.g., combat
     operations, humanitarian operations, base closures, peacekeeping operations,
     noncombatant evacuations, exercises, etc.).
     3.5.3. Observations should flow from the reporting individual and agency to the
     reviewing office or functional expert and, if required, to the next-level L2 office.
  3.6. After Action Report (AAR) Reporting.
     3.6.1. After Action reports (AARs) are intended to help Airmen fight a smarter, more
     capable fight. The next Airmen to deploy, to participate in that exercise, to train for that
     type contingency, etc., should benefit from reports submitted by those who have gone
     before. Timely submission of AARs (and the individual Observations which comprise
     them) are a command responsibility. Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF)
     commanders, commanders of subordinate AETF units, exercise/experiment directors, and
     other like commanders/directors are expected to submit a unit-level AAR for the event
     (deployment, contingency, exercise, etc.) for which they are responsible. AARs are
     posted in JLLIS and accessable to all registered users.
     3.6.2. Observations to be documented are those which result in improvements in military
     operations at the strategic, operational, or tactical level. AAR Observations should
     describe how the mission could be/was improved, potential risks to mission degradation
     and how to mitigate those risks. AARs are intended to be more than a summary or rollup
     of unit/tactical actions. Commanders/directors are not required to hold Observations until
     the end of an operation, exercise or AEF cycle to be included in an AAR. Whenever
     possible, AARs should be submitted as soon as practical to permit timely action.
     3.6.3. Units participating in operations as part of a continuous AEF cycle will submit
     AARs to their respective HHQ NLT than 45 days following the end of their deployment.
     AFFOR staff and AOC staff will also submit periodic AARs for continuous AEF
     operations (e.g., OEF). Individual Observations deserving urgent attention should not be
     delayed for inclusion in the next AAR but should be forwarded up the chain of command
     as soon as sufficient information is gathered. The goal is to get the information to the
     next set of deployers and/or HHQ staff decision makers quickly for action/resolution.
     3.6.4. AARs for operations not supported by a continuing AEF cycle, contingencies and
     exercises will be submitted to HHQ NLT 30 days after the end of the event unless
     otherwise directed.
12                                            AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012


     3.6.5. Owning organizations will review AARs to pull Observations for processing
     through the AFLP and post AARs to JLLIS. Lessons Identified during the review will be
     entered in JLLIS and disseminated to the appropriate OPR for information and resolution.
4. VALIDATION.
  4.1. Purpose. Validation consists of review by staff functionals and/or operational experts
  to confirm an Observation contains an identifiable lesson to be processed through the AFLP.
  Once validated, an Observation becomes a Lesson Identified and represents a matter (e.g.,
  capability, concept, process, procedure) to be sustained, improved or developed. A Lesson
  Identified contains a better way to accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader
  community. Validation ensures accuracy, applicability, and completeness, and activates the
  Observation in JLLIS. The goal of the validation process is to get to root causes.
  4.2. Validation Authority.
     4.2.1. The validation authority has a key role in the AFLP. Validation authorities will:
         4.2.1.1. Review Observations for accuracy, applicability and completeness. If
         Observations do not meet these criteria, validation authorities will contact the
         originator for futher clarification.
         4.2.1.2. Determine if an Observation had previously been addressed. If the
         Observation duplicates previous Observations, it will be manually linked in JLLIS
         with the previous Observations.
         4.2.1.3. Determine the applicable guiding documents (e.g., statute, DoD or AF
         instruction).
         4.2.1.4. Parse Observations to determine DOTMLPF&P actionable areas.
         4.2.1.5. Submit to the appropriate SME for evaluation. Once the SME confirms the
         Observation‟s validity, it is processed as a Lesson Identified. IG, stan/eval or QA
         offices will not be appointed as the evaluation agency.
         4.2.1.6. Ensure Lessons Identified are returned to the originating JLLIS Tier-1
         Administrator and/or Tier-2 Command Lesson Manager (CLM) for dissemination to
         issue resolution OPRs.
         4.2.1.7. Forward Lessons Identified intended for the HQ USAF staff through JLLIS
         to AF/A9L.
         4.2.1.8. Inform the chain of command as to status of Observations submitted to
         higher level L2 offices.
     4.2.2. Validation SMEs may be instructors, staff functionals, career field functional
     managers, commanders, senior AF leaders or L2 offices.
     4.2.3. Lessons Identified deemed as time-critical and/or mission-critical will be
     concurrently disseminated to other potentially interested organizations and individuals
     where mission impact may occur.
AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012                                                        13


5. DISSEMINATION.
  5.1. Purpose. Dissemination is the distribution of Lessons Identified to organizations for
  action, along with making lessons available for wider use. The goal of dissemination is to
  get lessons to decision makers when needed to make more informed decisions.
     5.1.1. Lessons may be disseminated through tasks, briefings, bulletins, reports or
     database entries.
     5.1.2. An OPR will be tasked to either resolve to closure Lessons Identified requiring
     DOTMLPF&P action/changes or ensure Lessons Identified requiring wider dissemination
     to a wider audience are appropriately promulgated.
     5.1.3. An OCR will be assigned as required by the originator of the lesson idenitifed or
     as required by the OPR.
  5.2. Dissemination Techniques.
     5.2.1. The guiding principle in executing a dissemination strategy is to get the right
     information to the right person at the right time. Dissemination of Lessons Identified to
     individuals or organizations may be solicited or unsolicited. Techniques for either type
     of dissemination encompass both „push‟ and „pull‟ methodologies.
         5.2.2.1. “Push” methodologies transmit lessons proactively to identified recipients.
         In this case, L2 specialists identify target audiences for dissemination. Examples of
         when to “push” Lessons Identified are when assisting planning staffs during emerging
         situations (contingencies, relief operations, etc.), assisting headquarters staffs with
         Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) decisions, and when
         sending completed L2 documents such as AARs to identified audiences via a
         subscription service. Push solicited information when responding to a Request for
         Information (RFI). In this case, L2 specialists may push relevant lessons on the
         particular event or topic to the requesting party.
         5.2.2.2. “Pull” methodologies allow individuals to retrieve lessons by conducting
         JLLIS queries or by researching and retrieving published L2 reports and bulletins.
         (The “Daily Digest” feature in JLLIS is a “pull” resource.)
     5.2.3. Other dissemination processes may already exist within lower echelons or
     functional communities. Examples include the Tactics Review Board process and the
     Maintenance Quality Assurance flash process. Integration of Lessons Identified provides
     a mechanism to integrate the AFLP with lower echelon processes.
     5.2.4. Although dissemination activities may be conducted using different approaches,
     the basic process step of identifying action items must take place for each Lesson
     Identified before submittal to the resolution processes or inclusion in publications,
     reports, summaries, briefings and analyses.
6. RESOLUTION.
  6.1. Purpose. In Resolution, Lessons Identified are tracked to ensure they become a
  Lessons Learned and are not forgotten or ignored. Resolution ensures they are staffed for
  action (DOTMLPF&P changed), captured in JLLIS (or appropriate documents) and tracked
14                                             AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012


  to closure. Tracking Lessons Identified is a process that occurs throughout the life cycle of a
  validated Observation.
     6.1.1. Resolution has three main objectives:
         6.1.1.1. Enhance the Air Force‟s and the joint community‟s ability to learn from the
         conduct of operations across the levels of warfare, training activities, exercise events
         and other activities.
         6.1.1.2. Enhance warfighting capabilities by documenting potential solutions across
         DOTMLPF&P approaches and implementation decisions.
         6.1.1.3. Support Air Force senior leaders as well as a broad range of subject specific
         stakeholders.
  6.2. Tracking Issue Resolution (TIR). TIR ensures Lessons Identified are worked to
  closure. TIR documentation establishes accountability for resolution, monitors resolution
  actions to closure, and provides a means of disseminating Lessons Identified.
     6.2.1. AF/A9L will:
         6.2.1.1. Maintain a crossflow of Lessons Identified between the HAF, Services, Joint
         Staff, UCCs and other government organizations.
         6.2.1.2. In conjunction with SMEs and subordinate L2 offices, track the status of AF
         Lessons Identified to the JLLP. Tracking and coordination are essential for lessons
         with programmatic implications.
         6.2.1.3. Provide training on TIR including the use of JLLIS for all HAF
         organizations.     Training includes techniques on integrating lessons into
         staff/organization plans and operations as well as coordination of lessons between
         JLLIS MAJCOM Tier-1 Sites.
     6.2.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU L2 Organizations will:
     6.2.2.1.   Maintain a crossflow of Lessons Identified among lower echelons and HQ
     USAF.
         6.2.2.2. In conjunction with SMEs and subordinate L2 offices, track the status of
         Lessons Identified to the JLLP. Tracking and coordination are essential for lessons
         with programmatic implications.
         6.2.2.3. Provide training on TIR including the use of JLLIS for their respective
         organizations.     Training includes techniques on integrating lessons into
         staff/organization plans and operations as well as coordination of lessons between
         JLLIS NAF/Wing/Center/FOA/DRU Tier-2 CLMs.
     6.2.3. NAF/Center L2 Organizations will:
     6.2.3.1. Maintain a cross-flow of Lessons Identified within their command/ functional
     community.
         6.2.3.2. In conjunction with SMEs, track the status of NAF/Center Lessons
         Identified to the JLLP. Tracking and coordination are essential for lessons with
         programmatic implications.
AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012                                                        15


         6.2.3.3. Provide training on TIR including the use of JLLIS for their respective
         organizations.     Training includes techniques on integrating lessons into
         staff/organization plans and operations as well as coordination of lessons between
         JLLIS Tier-2 CLMs.
  6.3. Closure of Lesson Actions. Lessons Identified that are entered into an organization‟s
  resolution process should be resolved at the lowest level. Actions for Lessons Identified may
  be closed when a solution has been implemented or a decision made to accept the risk of not
  implementing a solution. Closed Lessons Identified will be archived in JLLIS for future
  reference and their final action/determination will be disseminated and periodically reviewed.
7. JOINT LESSONS LEARNED PROGRAM (JLLP).
  7.1. Purpose. The JLLP is governed by CJCSI 3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program.
  In support of the JLLP, the Air Force Lessons Learned Program will:
     7.1.1. Provide and maintain JLLP support for Air Force-specific, tactical, operational
     and strategic level lessons.
     7.1.2. Interact with other stakeholders within the JLLP community on L2 matters.
     7.1.3. Submit Lessons Identified that affect the joint community or requiring joint
     resolution to the Joint Staff.
  7.2. Concept. AF/A9L will:
     7.2.1. Represent the Air Force to the Joint Staff and the JLLP community on JLLP
     matters except when the JLLP matter only applies to a specific UCC. Air Force matters
     only applying to a specific UCC will be represented by the AF component to that UCC.
     7.2.2. Provide personnel and technical expertise to document Lessons Identified, analyze
     causation and impact, train collection team SMEs and coordinate Air Force SME
     participation in JLLP activities.
     7.2.3. Track and coordinate joint Lessons Identified within the AFL2P.
  7.3. Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Integration. L2
  involvement and participation in the JLLP will include:
     7.3.1. Monitoring joint L2 products to include the JCIDS and Joint Staff Action
     Processing systems.
     7.3.2. Assisting HQ USAF MAJCOM offices with Joint L2 submissions and
     DOTMLPF&P Change Request (DCR) development, as required.
8. AIR FORCE LESSONS LEARNED PROGRAM (AFL2P) TRAINING.
  8.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFL2P training is to ensure individuals assigned to L2
  offices or as collection team augmentees/SMEs receive appropriate L2 training to understand
  their role in the AFLP.
  8.2. AF Lessons Learned Program Training. AF/A9L is responsible for oversight of the
  AFL2P training program. Each L2 office will ensure its training program is up to date with
  material found on the AF Lessons Learned Program website: https://www.jllis.mil/usaf or
  http://www.jllis.smil.mil/usaf. AF/A9L will provide train-the-trainer services for all aspects

  of the AFL2P. Each L2 office will establish guidelines to maintain curreny for members
  supporting their L2 program.
  8.3. L2 Collection Team Training. L2 offices will provide collection team members
  training prior to L2 collection efforts. Training will include collection plan development,
  conduct of interviews, collection management tools (JLLIS, interview management tools,
  etc.), data gathering techniques, product development, and dissemination. L2 collection team
  members and SMEs provide expertise required for a focused collection. The L2 collection
  team lead is responsible for coordinating training with the JLLIS Tier-1 Administrator or
  Tier-2 CLM.
  8.4. JLLIS Training. L2 offices will provide JLLIS training to their orgainzations and
  lower echlons. Local training will emphasize use of JLLIS for capturing and managing
  Observations and Lessons Identified.
9. JOINT LESSONS LEARNED INFORMATION SYSTEM (JLLIS).
  9.1. DoD system of record for JLLP. JLLIS is a web-based system that implements the
  requirements for the JLLP. JLLP provides transfer of knowledge within the DoD through the
  rapid distribution of Observations and recommendations, AARs, TTPs, topic papers,
  briefings and interviews.
  9.2. JLLIS. JLLIS allows Air Force personnel to search, submit and manage all Air Force
  Observations, lessons, AARs, L2 and other information up to SECRET. JLLIS is used to
  track and disseminate Lessons Identified throughout the Air Force and DoD. JLLIS provides
  L2 office management, data collection, data management and L2 information distribution.
  9.3. System Administration.
     9.3.1. AF/A9L is responsible for system administration of the AF JLLIS master site
     through coordination with Joint Staff/J7 and JLLIS programmers.
     9.3.2. The AF/A9 JLLIS Program Manager will update the JLLIS User Guide and
     checklists, maintain a standard training package on the JLLIS home page and update this
     instruction annually or when changes to the system and/or process occur.
  9.4. JLLIS Business Rules.
     9.4.1. The JLLIS community will abide by the CJCSI 3150.25, JLLIS Business Rules
     and the following guidelines in managing their JLLIS operations:
         9.4.1.1. A Tier-1 is at the HAF and MAJCOM level. All other organizations will be
         assigned as a Tier-2. A Lesson Manager is the manager of Observations and Lessons
         Identified at the Tier-1 and Tier-2 level. A SME is a person within a Directorate or
         Command possessing expertise on an Observation, finding, issue, or Lesson
         Identified.
         9.4.1.2. Validation Process. Tier-1 and Tier-2 Lesson Managers and SMEs will
         review all “Pending” lessons within their Tier. Once an Observation is deemed valid,
         the Tier-1 or Tier-2 Lesson Manager will activate the Observation as a Lesson
         Identified and transfer it to the appropriate OPR/OCR for review. Observations that
         require work within the Tier will be coordinated through the Tier-1/Tier-2 CLM or
         the appropriate OPR/OCR.
AFI 90-1601_AFISRASUP_I 17 APRIL 2012                                                      17


        9.4.1.3. Coordinating Observations Outside a Tier-1. Tier-1 Lesson Managers will
        work together toward resolving an Observation‟s ownership. If the OPR/OCR for an
        Observation belongs to another Tier-1, the owning Tier-1 Admin will contact the
        appropriate Tier-1 Admin for coordination before transferring. Once transferred, the
        accepting Tier-1 assumes responsibility for the Observation. If it is found that the
        OPR/OCR is incorrect, the process will begin again. If ownership cannot be resolved
        at the Tier-1 level, AF/A9L will resolve ownership. All Lessons Identified will be
        worked through to resolution.
  9.5. Disputes between Tiers.
     9.5.1. As Lesson Managers receive Observations submitted by JLLIS users, there may be
     occasions where a Tier-2 is not appropriate to validate that Observation. In these cases,
     the Tier-2 Lesson Manager will transfer the Observation to their Tier-1 for reassignment.
     When doing this, include results of any coordination in the “comment” section of the
     Observation in JLLIS.
     9.5.2. When Observation reassignments between Tier-2 CLMs are disputed, the issue
     should be brought to the attention of the MAJCOM L2 Director to render a recommended
     assignment. If the dispute continues, the MAJCOM L2 Director will present it to
     AF/A9L for L2 GOSG review and coordination. The L2 GOSG is chaired by the
     AF/CVA. The AF/CVA will serve as final arbiter of disputed Observations assignments
     if necessary.
  9.6. JLLIS Maintenance.
     9.6.1. Tier Maintenance. All Tier-1 Administrators should perform periodic Tier
     maintenance. Maintenance includes reviewing the status of “Active” Observations. Any
     Observations that have not been worked in more than 30 days should be reviewed and
     readdressed by the Tier-1 or Tier-2 CLM through the OPR/OCR for resolution, closure or
     removal from the database.
        9.6.1.1. Observations that should be removed include the following: “Test
        Observations,” Observations that are incomplete or unfocused, complaints or personal
        attacks.
        9.6.1.2. Test Binders and AARs should also be removed periodically to keep the Tier
        free of unnecessary information.
     9.6.2. MAJCOMs or NAFs that are an air component to a UCC may be asked by the
     UCC to participate in the UCC L2 program. Component MAJCOMs and NAFs will
     participate in their UCC‟s L2 program as directed by UCC policy and are authorized to
     coordinate Observations directly with their responsible UCC. Coordination may be
     conducted by emailing the Observation to the UCC JLLIS Administrator or by entering
     the Observation on the UCC JLLIS site.
     9.6.3. MAJCOMs not a component of a UCC will forward Observations requiring Joint,
     DoD Agency or UCC coordination to the HAF Tier-1 or the appropriate MAJCOM/C-
     NAF. The HAF Tier-1 Administrator will notify the responsible action officer/SME who
     will review and validate the Observation with their Joint, Agency or UCC point of
     contact and assume responsibility for tracking the Observation through to resolution.

     9.6.4. JLLIS website status updates are the responsibility of the AF/A9L action
     officer. Updates are available upon request through the responsible AF/A9L action
     officer.
  9.7. JLLIS Configuration Review Board (CRB).
     9.7.1. The JLLIS CRB will be held semiannually as part of the AF L2 Community
     Conference. The AF CRB will be scheduled to allow sufficient time to address AF
     requirements prior to the Joint CRB.
     9.7.2. The Board will review action items from the previous Board, configuration issues,
     modifications and business rules. Each Tier-1 Administrator will have an opportunity to
     provide input during the Air Force JLLIS CRB. New JLLIS technologies will also be
     reviewed during the Technical Sessions of the Air Force L2 Community Conference.
     9.7.3. The Air Force JLLIS CRB is chaired by the Air Force JLLIS Program Manager.
     Tier-1 Administrators and the Recorder are voting members of the CRB. Members of the
     Joint Staff/J7 have a standing invitation to attend. This courtesy is also extended to the
     other members of the Air Force JLLIS and L2 community.
     9.7.4. Each Tier-1 Administrator is responsible to collect input(s) from their respective
     Tier-2s for the Air Force CRB prior to the conference. The purpose is to provide an
     opportunity for Administrators to speak/vote for the actions that affect their Tier. The
     Tier-2 CLMs are not voting members of the Air Force CRB. In the event of a tie during
     the voting process, the Air Force JLLIS Program Manager will cast the deciding vote.
     9.7.5. All Air Force CRB items that impact the other JLLIS master sites must go before
     the Joint Staff/J7 and the Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conference (WJTSC)
     CRB for review and approval. The AF JLLIS Program Manager will represent the Air
     Force during the WJTSC on all Air Force JLLIS related issues. Results from the WJTSC
     will be shared and reviewed by the JLLIS L2 community.
  9.8. Network Security.
     9.8.1. Joint Staff/J7 policy and guidance for NIPRNET JLLIS only allows access to
     Australia, Canada, Great Britain and United States (ACGU) personnel and Foreign
     Exchange Officers / LNOs sponsored and/or assigned to DoD organizations. United
     States Government has a National Disclosure Policy for SIPRNET. The following
     information is in accordance with Joint Staff/J7 guidance pending release of formal DoD
     guidance for JLLIS:
        9.8.1.1. JLLIS information is considered For Official Use Only (FOUO). If there is a
        requirement to convert/migrate FOUO data to a DoD-wide system of Controlled
        Unclassified Information (CUI), the FOUO marking of JLLIS products will help
        prevent commercial access but allow access to those with valid requirements and
        registration (soft certs).
        9.8.1.2. DoD Instruction 8110.1, Multinational Information Sharing Networks
        Implementation, February 6, 2004 implements policy and designates the MNIS
        Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (MNIS CENTRIXS) as
        the DoD standard for multinational information sharing networks using the Global
        Information Grid (GIG).

Terms
Active—A status of a Lesson Identified indicating that the lesson is currently being worked to
resolution by a DOTMLPF&P OPR.
After Action Report (AAR)—The AAR is a consolidated report that includes an executive
summary covering the event information (e.g., dates, locations, and participants) and
Observations. Observations to be documented are those which result in improvements in
military operations. AAR Observations should describe how the mission could be/was
improved, potential risks to mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks.
Collection—Collection is a method by which Observations enter the AFLP and involves formal
and informal methods. Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection
efforts or they can be “pushed” into the process by organizations, units and individual Airmen.
In a learning culture, every Airman, civilian and contractor contribute to the AFLP.
Dissemination—Dissemination is the distribution of Lessons Identified to organizations for
action, along with making lessons available for wider use. The goal of dissemination is to get
lessons to decision makers when needed to make more informed decisions.
DOTMLPF&P—Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership & Education,
Personnel, Facilities and Policy are factors that implement senior leader guidance and lead to the
development and employment of joint force capabilities.
Lesson Identified—A validated Observation that represents a matter (e.g., capability, concept,
process, procedure) to be sustained, improved or developed. A Lesson Identified contains a
better way to accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader organization.
Lesson Learned—An insight gained that improves military operations or activities at the
strategic, operational, or tactical level and results in long-term, internalized change to an
individual or an organization.
Observation—An input from any source into the AFLP. Observations contain information
regarding specific events, activities, circumstances or outcomes and should include sufficient
factual and contextual information to support their validation.
Resolution—Process to ensure Lessons Identified are staffed for action. Resolution actions
should be captured in JLLIS or appropriate documents and tracked to closure.
System of Record (SoR)—An information storage system (commonly implemented on a
computer system), which is the authoritative data source for a given data element or piece of
information. The need to identify systems of record can become acute in organizations where
management information systems have been built by taking output data from multiple source
systems, re-processing this data, and then re-presenting the result for a new business use. Where
the integrity of the data is vital, a data element must either be linked to, or extracted directly from
its system of record. The integrity and validity of any data set is open to question when there is
no traceable connection with a known System of Record.

Validation—Process to ensure an Observation is reviewed by staff functionals and/or
operational experts to confirm an Observation contains an identifiable lesson to be processed
through the AFLP.
