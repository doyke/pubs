accounts will not be accepted.
1.11.13.3.2. (Added) Changes to initial requests will not be accepted after 10 duty days prior to the class
start date.
1.11.13.3.3. (Added) The AETC CRO will then forward the consolidated course request using Excel®

later than 30 days prior to class start date. The SRO will provide course attendees with assigned TLNs.
(NOTE: Under no circumstances will the SRO contact HQ AETC/A1SET directly concerning any part of
the SORTS MTT process.)
1.11.13.3.5. (Added) The AETC CRO will consider, on a case-by-case basis: individual swap-outs, can-
cellations, or changes due to emergencies or adverse circumstances. As soon as adverse information
16                                                            AFI10-201_AETCSUP1 24 APRIL 2006


becomes available, the SRO will e-mail information to the HQ AETC SORTS group account and request
change. The AETC CRO will notify the SRO if the request was successfully changed.
1.11.13.3.6. (Added) The SORTS MTT schedule is posted on the Command Post Career Field Web site:
https://www.xo.hq.af.mil/xoo/xooo/AFOG/Homepage.html.
1.13.2. When submitting reports, the AETC SROs will not use the override option in Air Force SORTS
Data Entry Tool unless authorized by the AETC CRO.
1.14. (Added) AETC SORTS Score Report. The AETC SORTS Score Report measures a wing's ability
to transmit timely and accurate reports through the Defense Information Systems Agency SORTS proces-
sor. HQ AETC/A3XC will transmit the report monthly to all wing commanders and command posts. On
Mondays, errors are assessed to wings with expired forecast dates, RICDA dates (report date), and narra-
tive remark dates exceeding 30 days. To ensure the currency of unit SORTS databases, wing SROs must
check the AETC/A3XC SORTS classified Web page and HQ AF/XOOA SORTS Web page daily.
(NOTE: The reporting requirement in paragraph 1.14. (Added) is exempt from licensing according to
AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Pub-
lic, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections, paragraph 2.11.12.)
2.4.1. AETC units must submit SORTS reports no later than 2400 local time on the 28th day of each
month unless directed by the CRO. If the 28th day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, submit the
reports no later than the last duty day prior to the 28th.
2.4.7. Use the Global Command and Control System file transfer protocol as the primary method of
transmission for all AETC SORTS reports. Use the Defense Message System (DMS) as the secondary
method of transmission. ACTION addressee is “FORSTAT WASHINGTON DC//” for DMS SORTS
reports.
2.5.1. The commander’s assessment is only applied to the overall C-level field; therefore, base the fore-
cast C-level (change rating [CARAT]) and forecast get well/worse date (GWD) (date of change
[CADAT]) on an actual C-level change, not the commander’s assessment C-level. Forecast dates
(CADAT) will not exceed 12 months without prior FAM guidance.
2.5.2. Units will base the forecast remark (CADAT) on the projected C-level it expects to be in 3, 6, and
12 months. Base this forecast on a snapshot in time (that is, the C-level status the unit will be 3 months
from the date of the prepared report), not a window period (the lowest C-level expected over the 3- to
6-month period of time).
2.11. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Percentages and C-levels alone reveal a very small portion of a
unit’s issues. Only by thorough, well-written remarks can analysts of the SORTS data receive a “big pic-
ture” of a unit’s status. This big picture is critical for determining the type and quantity of help a unit
needs. Therefore, remarks must provide enough detail for any analyst, in or out of the reporting functional
area, to understand all aspects of an issue. For remarks preparation, the use of Table 2.8. (Added) and
Table 2.9. (Added) is mandatory.
2.11.6.1. (Added) Do not repeat data in multiple remarks, that is, do not submit two remarks with the
exact same text. Remarks are used to extract a certain type of data. Repeating data or referring to other
remarks does not add value to the extracting data for analysis.
2.11.6.2. (Added) Wing commanders must review and approve or disapprove all remarks and ensure
compliance of remarks with the basic AFI and this supplement.
AFI10-201_AETCSUP1 24 APRIL 2006                                                                     17


2.11.7.1.1. (Added) When a unit is less than P-1, begin the PRRES remark by identifying UTC/AFSC/
AUTH/ASGN/AVAIL/PCT/PRC (personnel reason code), CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, and GWD. State
the specific reason why the unit is less than P-1. For example, if the problem is availability, how many
personnel are not available and for what reason? If personnel are authorized but not assigned, what
actions are being worked with the military personnel flight and HQ AETC?
2.11.7.4. When calculated, the PERTP remark shortages (required minus assigned) must equate to the
personnel shortages in the personnel figure field on the easy read.
2.11.8. For each subarea less than 90 percent, use the following format to explain the reasons why the a
subarea is less than S-1:


        EQUIP TYPE/NUMBER REQUIRED/ON-HAND/PCT/EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
        ON-HAND REASON CODE/CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND GWD.

2.11.9.1. For each subarea less than 90 percent, use the following format to explain the primary reasons
