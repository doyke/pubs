This instruction explains how to record information on candidates disenrolled from officer training and
request information on those previously disenrolled who later apply for another officer program. It
applies to all commands and activities that process applications for officer candidate training or direct
appointment, including those in the United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard
(ANG). It interfaces with Air Force Policy Directive 36-20, Accession of Air Force Military Personnel.
This instruction directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 autho-
rized by Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 8013. Title 44, Section 3101 authorizes you to
maintain these records. System of Records Notice F035 AF MP R, Application for Appointment and
Extended Active Duty Files, also applies. Process supplements that affect any military personnel function
as shown in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 37-160, volume 1, table 3.2, The Air Force Publications and
Forms Management Programs--Developing and Processing Publications (formerly Air Force Regulation
(AFR) 5-8).

1. Recording Information. The Military Services use DD Form 785, Record of Disenrollment from
Officer Candidate-Type Training, to record information on individuals disenrolled from an officer can-
didate training program (see Attachment 2 for a list of programs).

2. Preparing DD Form 785.
    2.1. Staff members responsible for disenrollment processing prepare the form and attach a duplicate
    to the disenrollment investigation or the faculty board proceedings. The individuals listed in Table 1.,
    column B, or designee review each DD Form 785 to ensure it is prepared correctly, is fully substanti-
    ated, and then sends the DD Form 785 to the authority indicated in Table 1., column C (or designee)
    for approval.
    2.2. Send the original form to the proper custodian for inclusion in the individual’s Unit Personnel
    Record Group if the individual will enter extended active duty (EAD) or active Reserve or Guard sta-
    tus. Otherwise, send the original form to the proper custodian for inclusion in the individual’s Master
    Personnel Record Group.
    2.3. Prepare the form in detail to avoid the need for further evaluation. (See Attachment 3)
    2.4. Explain why the individual was removed from the training program.
    2.5. Make specific recommendations for further training. (See Attachment 4)

3. DELETED.

4. Requesting Information on Previously Disenrolled Individuals. The Military Services use DD
Form 785 to exchange information on a person who previously disenrolled from an officer candidate
training program in any service and who later applies to another program.
    4.1. A person disenrolled from a military service academy for any reason or disenrolled from any
    other officer training listed in Attachment 2 because of lack of aptitude, indifference to training,
    incompatibility, breach of the AFROTC contract terms, undesirable character traits, or disciplinary
    reasons, may not reenroll in any Air Force officer commissioning program or be appointed to any Air
    Force component without a waiver from the appropriate approval authority specified in AFI 36-2005,

               MANDATORY INFORMATION TO INCLUDE ON DD FORM 785


A3.1. Section II--Program Information Applicable at Time Disenrolled. Enter OTS in item 11 for OTS
disenrollments followed by the procurement source that brought the individual to OTS (e.g., OTS/AECP,
OTS/CIV, OTS/RES).

A3.2. Section III--Reasons and Circumstances for Disenrollment. Elaborate on the factors that led to the
officer trainee’s disenrollment. Avoid generalities so that an agency considering an individual for reen-
rollment can objectively assess the individual’s potential for commissioned officer status. Continue com-
ments under "Remarks" in section IV or on the reverse side of the form. In cases involving breach of the
honor code, state "breach of honor code" and give concise explanation of the circumstances. Support the
statement with a suitable recommendation under section IV.

A3.3. Section IV--Evaluation To Be Considered in the Future for Determining Acceptability for Other
Officer Training. See Attachment 4 to determine the block to check. Fully explain your recommenda-
tion under "Remarks." Use the reverse side of the form if you need additional space. Include the follow-
ing details in the remarks when appropriate: Individual was a member of the AFROTC 4- or 2-year
program, CSP, or ASCP, total dollar amount of subsistence paid, month and year the cadet completed
field training (state whether 4- or 6-week session), AFOQT scores, if available, and individual has or has
not incurred an active duty service commitment.

  DISENROLLMENT RECOMMENDATION GUIDE: CADETS AND OFFICER TRAINEES


A4.1. Block 1--Highly Recommended. Give this recommendation only to those few individuals whose
military and academic performances clearly demonstrate they have exceeded the standards of the com-
missioning program. You must determine that their capabilities are exceptional in all the following areas:
judgment, planning and organization, adaptability to stress, communication skills, and professional qual-
ities. Their cumulative grade point average (GPA) usually meets or exceeds 3.0 (4.0 scale). They nor-
mally have resigned or been disenrolled for circumstances beyond their control. May be appropriate for
some AFROTC Aerospace Studies (AS) 100 contract cadets who exercise first year option to disenroll.

A4.2. Block 2--Recommended as an Average Student. Give this recommendation to individuals
whose performance met or exceeded minimum program standards. They must not have had any serious
conduct or aptitude problems. Their cumulative academic GPA for degree work usually exceeds 2.0 (4.0
scale). Most are strongly motivated to obtain a commission in the Air Force or another service. You usu-
ally give this rating to USAFA cadets who voluntarily resign and have at least an average military perfor-
mance average (MPA) and a cumulative GPA that exceeds 2.0. Appropriate for AFROTC AS 100
contract cadets who voluntarily disenroll.

A4.3. Block 3--Should Not Be Considered Without Weighing the "Needs of the Service" Against
the Reasons for Disenrollment. Give this recommendation to individuals whose aptitude, personal
behavior, or motivation has rendered their potential for future commissioning questionable. This rating is
usually given to USAFA cadets who resign in-lieu-of action under or conviction for a breach of the honor
code, and AFROTC AS 200 and above contract cadets disenrolled for breach or anticipatory breach of
contract. Appropriate for AFROTC AS 100 contract cadets who are disenrolled for cause other than
breach due to exercising their first year option to voluntarily disenroll.

A4.4. Block 4--Recommended if Physical Defects are Corrected or if Such Defects Are Not Disqual-
ifying for Other Reasons. Give this recommendation only to individuals disenrolled for medical rea-
sons. Clarify the degree to which you recommend the individual for future officer training in the remarks
section. NOTE: It is not mandatory that you give an individual disenrolled for medical reasons a block 4
rating. If other than a block 4 rating is appropriate, rate accordingly and explain in the remarks section.

A4.5. Block 5--Definitely Not Recommended. Give this rating to those whose aptitude or personal
behavior have consistently failed to meet the minimum standards. These individuals may have a docu-
mented history of serious problems as shown by their repeated placement on probation or involvement in
some illegal or immoral activity, such as cases involving drugs or marijuana, deficiency in conduct or
aptitude, sexual misbehavior, and indifference to training. May be appropriate for breach or anticipatory
breach of AFROTC contract cadets in AS 200 and above.

A4.6. Block 6--Other Remarks. Reserve this rating for either USAFA and AFROTC-CSP use or
AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (ASCP) first semester AS 100 cadets. The
USAFA uses it instead of the usual recommendation for future officer training when the observation
period is too limited to properly evaluate the potential of a fourth-class cadet or officer trainee. Confine

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change incorporates IC 98-1 which clarifies the requirement for a reviewing authority by changing
the name to approving authority (paragraph 2.1.); deletes Authenticating DD Form 785 (paragraph 3.).
deletes references to Air Force Regulations (paragraph 4.1.); realigns responsibilities based on organiza-
tional changes and corrects name of approving authority (Table 1.); changes reference to Officer Training
School (OTS) Basic Training to OTS Basic Officer Training (BOT) (Table 1. and Table 2.); updates
address at the Air Reserve Personnel Center and for the Academy of Military Science (AMS) comman-
dant (Table 2.), adds references, abbreviations and terms (Attachment 1); renumbers the Officer Train-
ing programs to (Attachment 2); changes information in Section IV of the DD Form 785 to reflect a
dollar amount instead of number of days for which subsistence was paid (attachment 3, paragraph A3.3.),
and modifies the Disenrollment Recommendation Guide for Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
(AFROTC) breach cases (Attachment 4). See the last attachment (Attachment 5) of the publication, IC
98-1, for the complete IC. A vertical bar ( | )indicates revision from the previous edition.

2.1. Staff members responsible for disenrollment processing prepare the form and attach a duplicate to
the disenrollment investigation or the faculty board proceedings. The individuals listed in Table 1., col-
umn B, or designee review each DD Form 785 to ensure it is prepared correctly, is fully substantiated, and
then sends the DD Form 785 to the authority indicated in Table 1., column C (or designee) for approval.

3. DELETED.

4.1. A person disenrolled from a military service academy for any reason or disenrolled from any other
officer training listed in Attachment 2 because of lack of aptitude, indifference to training, incompatibil-
ity, breach of the AFROTC contract terms, undesirable character traits, or disciplinary reasons, may not
reenroll in any Air Force officer commissioning program or be appointed to any Air Force component
without a waiver from the appropriate approval authority specified in AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Com-
missioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories -- Reserve of the Air

                        Mandatory Information To Include on DD Form 785


A3.1. Section II--Program Information Applicable at Time Disenrolled. Enter OTS in item 11 for OTS
disenrollments followed by the procurement source that brought the individual to OTS (e.g., OTS/AECP,
OTS/CIV, OTS/RES).

A3.2. Section III--Reasons and Circumstances for Disenrollment. Elaborate on the factors that led to the
officer trainee’s disenrollment. Avoid generalities so that an agency considering an individual for reen-
rollment can objectively assess the individual’s potential for commissioned officer status. Continue com-
ments under "Remarks" in section IV or on the reverse side of the form. In cases involving breach of the
honor code, state "breach of honor code" and give concise explanation of the circumstances. Support the
statement with a suitable recommendation under section IV.

A3.3. Section IV--Evaluation To Be Considered in the Future for Determining Acceptability for Other
Officer Training. See Attachment 4 to determine the block to check. Fully explain your recommenda-
tion under "Remarks." Use the reverse side of the form if you need additional space. Include the follow-
ing details in the remarks when appropriate: Individual was a member of the AFROTC 4- or 2-year
program, CSP, or ASCP, total dollar amount of subsistence paid, month and year the cadet completed
field training (state whether 4- or 6-week session), AFOQT scores, if available, and individual has or has
not incurred an active duty service commitment.

  DISENROLLMENT RECOMMENDATION GUIDE: CADETS AND OFFICER TRAINEES


A4.1. Block 1--Highly Recommended. Give this recommendation only to those few individuals whose
military and academic performances clearly demonstrate they have exceeded the standards of the com-
missioning program. You must determine that their capabilities are exceptional in all the following areas:
judgment, planning and organization, adaptability to stress, communication skills, and professional qual-
ities. Their cumulative grade point average (GPA) usually meets or exceeds 3.0 (4.0 scale). They nor-
mally have resigned or been disenrolled for circumstances beyond their control. May be appropriate for
some AFROTC Aerospace Studies (AS) 100 contract cadets who exercise first year option to disenroll.
22                                                                           AFI36-2012 31 JULY 1998

A4.2. Block 2--Recommended as an Average Student. Give this recommendation to individuals
whose performance met or exceeded minimum program standards. They must not have had any serious
conduct or aptitude problems. Their cumulative academic GPA for degree work usually exceeds 2.0 (4.0
scale). Most are strongly motivated to obtain a commission in the Air Force or another service. You usu-
ally give this rating to USAFA cadets who voluntarily resign and have at least an average military perfor-
mance average (MPA) and a cumulative GPA that exceeds 2.0. Appropriate for AFROTC AS 100
contract cadets who voluntarily disenroll.

A4.3. Block 3--Should Not Be Considered Without Weighing the "Needs of thService" Against the
Reasons for Disenrollment. Give this recommendation to individuals whose aptitude, personal behav-
ior, or motivation has rendered their potential for future commissioning questionable. This rating is usu-
ally given to USAFA cadets who resign in-lieu-of action under or conviction for a breach of the honor
code, and AFROTC AS 200 and above contract cadets disenrolled for breach or anticipatory breach of
contract. Appropriate for AFROTC AS 100 contract cadets who are disenrolled for cause other than
breach due to exercising their first year option to voluntarily disenroll.

A4.4. Block 4--Recommended if Physical Defects are Corrected or if Such Defects Are Not Dis-
qualifying for Other Reasons. Give this recommendation only to individuals disenrolled for medical
reasons. Clarify the degree to which you recommend the individual for future officer training in the
remarks section. NOTE: It is not mandatory that you give an individual disenrolled for medical reasons
a block 4 rating. If other than a block 4 rating is appropriate, rate accordingly and explain in the remarks
section.

A4.5. Block 5--Definitely Not Recommended. Give this rating to those whose aptitude or personal
behavior have consistently failed to meet the minimum standards. These individuals may have a docu-
mented history of serious problems as shown by their repeated placement on probation or involvement in
some illegal or immoral activity, such as cases involving drugs or marijuana, deficiency in conduct or
aptitude, sexual misbehavior, and indifference to training. May be appropriate for breach or anticipatory
breach of AFROTC contract cadets in AS 200 and above.

A4.6. Block 6--Other Remarks. Reservethis rating for either USAFA and AFROTC-CSP use or
AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (ASCP) first semester AS 100 cadets. The
USAFA uses it instead of the usual recommendation for future officer training when the observation
period is too limited to properly evaluate the potential of a fourth-class cadet or officer trainee. Confine
Block 6 use to evaluating the performance of trainees for the period between the beginning of basic cadet
training and their first academic progress report in the fall.
