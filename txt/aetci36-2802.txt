SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document
changes applicability from 19 Air Force to HQ AETC/A2/3/10; changes the suspense date for
nominations to 31 January; deletes award categories for combat rescue officers, special tactics
officer, combat controllers, pararescue, and survival, evasion, resistance, and escape personnel;
and adds BMT annual awards; clarifies content of the nomination package; clarifies the AETC
selection process and changes the administrative oversight to HQ AETC/A2/3/10 Directors
Action Group (DAG).
1. Program Overview
     1.1. Throughout AETC both civilian and military Air Force personnel are performing at a
     level that ensures AETC provides the highest quality of training for our customers. The
     AETC Flying and Technical Training, Training Support, BMT and MTL Annual Recognition
     Program selects 19 individuals who possess the expertise in their assigned duties, have made
     significant achievements to the training enterprise, and have demonstrated high measures of
     dedication to the Air Force core values, community support, and personal improvement.
     1.2. These awards spotlight individuals whose contributions to the Air Force and AETC
     missions have exceeded the minimum standards and expectations. It is the intent that this
     recognition program will increase professional prestige for both the nominees and award
     recipients, stimulate competition, increase mission effectiveness, improve morale, and
     sustain AETCâ€™ s commitment to excellence. Note: Base support and contract personnel are
     not eligible for these awards.
2. Waivers.
2.1. Policy and procedures. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special
consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions. To facilitate evaluation of waiver
requests, a process is established for review of proposed waivers.
AETCI36-2802 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   3


2.2. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise stated in this instruction, HQ AETC/A3P is the
waiver authority for waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction. (T-
2) For waivers to unit supplements, the unit generating the supplement will identify the waiver
authority to that supplemental guidance.
2.3. Waiver Requests. Requests for waiver must be submitted through the group or wing
commander and 2 AF (2 AF units only) to HQ AETC/A3P. (T-2) Waiver requests must:
       2.3.1. Identify the specific policy reference and text to be waived.
       2.3.2. Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the 3 reasons listed under AFI 33-360,
       paragraph 1.9.1 apply and describe why.
       2.3.3. Time period or circumstance for which the waiver will be required.
       2.3.4. Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during the
       waiver period.
       2.3.5. Impact if waiver is disapproved.
2.4. Units will upload approved waivers into Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) for
inspection activity review. Because waivers are the expression of a specific commander
accepting risk, Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers expire 30 days after a change of command unless the new
commander renews the waiver. For non-tiered waivers, a waiver remains in effect until canceled
in writing by the approving official, the publication is revised, or the waiver expires.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. HQ AETC/A2/3/10 DAG will manage the awards process for the Flying Training,
   Technical Training, Training Support, BMT, and MTL Annual Recognition Program and
   forward the results to HQ AETC/CV for approval. The HQ AETC/A2/3/10 DAG will:
       3.1.1. Solicit nominations from the training wings and groups (if not aligned under a
       training wing).
       3.1.2. Solicit and select board members (CMSgts or above, GS-13s or above and O-4s or
       above). Evaluation boards will consist of 5 members and select the recipient for their
       respective category. Multiple boards may be established for any category to expedite
       review and scoring of nomination packages. Note: The AETC/CV must approve all
       recipients before any announcements are made.
           3.1.2.1. Flying Training Board. As a minimum, one member from outside the
           directorate and a member from each of the following divisions: A3F, A3R, A3V, and
           A3Z.
           3.1.2.2. Technical Training Board. As a minimum, one member from outside the

           directorate and one member from each of the following divisions A3F, A3P, A3R,
           and A3T. Note: Since HQ AETC/A3 are eligible for this award, a nominee will not
           sit on this board.

     requested.
     3.3. Wing and Group Commanders (if not aligned under a training wing) will establish a
     recognition program with categories that afford all training personnel an opportunity to
     compete for local recognition and subsequently compete for AETC and higher levels of
     recognition. AETC awards are listed in Table 4.1. Where applicable, the tables indicate Air
     Force-level recognition and the organizational sponsor for winners in specific categories.
     Recognition external to AETC will be initiated and conducted by the sponsoring
     organization.
        3.3.1. One nominee may be submitted for each AETC annual award category, as
        applicable.
        3.3.2. Wing public affairs office should publicize the accomplishments of award
        recipients through base and community media. Recognition at wing-, group-, and
        squadron-level meetings and functions is encouraged.
4. Award Categories.
     4.1. Flying Training. Flying training awards recognize exceptional performance of
     instructors and flight commanders in formal schools that teach and support officially
     designated flying training courses. There are four AETC flying training award categories (see
     Table 4.1). Note: The Major General Glenn A. Profitt II Award is an award given to the
     AETC Flying Training Officer Instructor of the Year. Note: The competition is not limited
     to pilots.
     4.2. Technical Training. Technical training awards recognize exceptional performance of
     instructors and flight commanders or flight chiefs in formal schools that teach officially
     designated technical training courses. Nominees in instructor categories must be assigned to
     a T-prefix or equivalent, manpower position. There are six AETC Technical Training award
     categories (see Table 4.1).
     4.3. Training Support. This category affords an opportunity for competition to personnel
     who are neither flight commanders nor instructors. Training support awards recognize
     exceptional performance of personnel who perform duties in a flying, basic military, or
     technical training specific support function. (e.g. Training pipeline managers, resource
     advisors, cost center managers, registrars, career development course writers, training
     managers,       course     developers/managers,       interactive    multimedia       instruction
     developers/managers, training development element chiefs, and training evaluators) Note:
     Officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel assigned to T-prefixed or other instructor equivalent
     positions, MTIs, MTLs, and base support personnel are not eligible. There are five AETC
     Training Support award categories (see Table 4.1).
AETCI36-2802 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               5


     4.4. Basic Military Training (BMT). The BMT awards                recognize exceptional
     performance to personnel with special duty identifier 8B000 assigned to the 737 Training
     Group, 433rd Training Squadron, and AU Holm Center, Air Force Officer Training School
     and Flight Commanders at the 737 TRG. There are two AETC BMT award categories (see
     Table 4.1).
     4.5. Military Training Leader (MTL). The MTL awards recognize exceptional
     performance of personnel with special duty identifier 8B100. There are two AETC MTL
