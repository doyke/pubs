   areas.
   2.13.5. Taxiways Echo and Delta are the only 2 taxiways that cross all runways to the North
   and South Ramps and are heavily used by aircraft.
   2.13.6. Taxiways November and Yankee are high-speed taxiways for exiting Runway 8L.
   2.13.7. Taxiway Zulu is used for aircraft push backs from main terminal gates/spots.
   2.13.8. Use caution when crossing perimeter roads beyond the approach ends of the runways
   due to low-flying aircraft. Be extra vigilant when Runways 22L/22R are being used.
   2.13.9. Taxiways Victor and Tango are not monitored by HNL Ground Control. Contact
   Hickam Ramp Facility (HRF) on frequency 133.6 when operating in these areas.
2.14. HNL South Ramp Vehicle Safety.
   2.14.1. General Aviation and Cargo service companies provide cargo activities and ground
   handling services for transient and executive aircraft. Due to the various parked,
   departing/arriving aircraft, and cargo off-loading activities, use extreme caution when
   driving in these areas.
   2.14.2. Helicopter maintenance is located behind the Century Aviation hangar. Use caution,
   light aircraft and helicopters use the Taxilane C3 for engine run-ups.
2.15. Precision Approach Critical Areas.
   2.15.1. HNL runways have four precision-approach critical areas requiring protection from
   possible signal interference caused by aircraft and vehicles operating between the
   localizer/glide slope antennas and an arriving aircraft conducting an Instrument Landing
   System (ILS) approach. These protected areas are the Localizer and Glide Slope Critical
   Areas located at the departure and approach ends of Runways 8L and 4R, respectively.
   Aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from operating in these areas when the reported ceiling is
   less than 800 feet or the visibility is less than 2 miles and an aircraft is on an ILS approach.
   ILS instrument hold signs and taxiway instrument hold lines protect these areas figure 3.6.

   Always request approval from the Ground Controller prior to entering these areas
   Attachment 5, figure A5.1.-A5.3
2.16. Intrusion/Incursion Prevention.
   2.16.1. HNL ATCT has the ultimate authority over all traffic entering HNL AOA and will
   issue, by radio and/or light signals, specific instructions which approve, disapprove and/or
   recall the movement of aircraft,vehicles, equipment or personnel within the movement area.
   Every entry requires an approval and an appropriate exit call when departing the movement
   area.
   2.16.2. Vehicles shall use access roads and adjacent taxiways whenever possible to minimize
   runway crossings. Only in extreme circumstances will a vehicle operator cross an active
   runway and then only after approval is granted by HNL ATCT.
2.17. Additional Phraseology Training for Operations within the AOA. Proper phraseology
must be used during radio communications. See terms section for additional verbiage. Every
driver who communicates via the radio or has vehicle access must utilize proper radio
phraseology and maintain radio discipline while operating on the airfield.

                      VEHICLE PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Airfield Vehicle Operations.
   3.1.1. Personnel driving on the airfield must be in possession of a current state driver’s
   license, AF Form 483 (digitally signed by the AM or designated representative) and AF
   Form 1199 (Air Force Entry Control Card) with open area “4” and/or “20”(as applicable)
   prior to entry onto the airfield.
   3.1.2. Units (i.e., Fire Department, Contracting, Civil Engineering, etc.) sponsoring TDY
   personnel or non-base assigned contractors will provide all required training/briefings IAW
   this ADI or provide qualified escort for personnel working on the airfield.
   3.1.3. Contractors working 2 or more days on the airfield will be trained by their sponsoring
   unit ADPM.
   3.1.4. Contractors working 1 day (i.e., contract flight reps) are briefed and certified by AM.
   3.1.5. Responsibility for operating a vehicle on the airfield rests with the vehicle operator.
   The vehicle operator is responsible for ensuring occupants have seat belts fastened when the
   vehicle is in motion.
   3.1.6. Vehicles authorized on the airfield must enter at a designated Entry Control Point
   (ECP), unless otherwise coordinated with the 647 SFS (Attachment 2) for ECP location.
   3.1.7. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain decals (AFVA 11-240 and/or
   FAA Form 5280-7, Ground Vehicle Guide to Airport Signs and Markings) and an airfield
   diagram.
3.2. Airport Operating Area (AOA) Access and Emergency Removal Procedures.
   3.2.1. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may enter the AOA without specific approval from
   HNL Ground Control (Ground 121.9/Tower 118.1). Exception: One individual may act as
   an escort for two or more vehicles that remain within 250 feet of each other. Escorts must
   have means of communications with vehicles being escorted while operating in the AOA.
   3.2.2. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must read back ATCT-issued control instructions
   verbatim before entering the AOA. This is to allow time for correction if misinterpreted.
   Vehicle operators must always monitor HNL Ground Control (Ground 121.9/Tower 118.1)
   when operating in the AOA.
   3.2.3. Any vehicle proceeding onto the AOA will be equipped with rotating beacon or
   emergency flashers which is visible for at least 1 mile IAW HNL and JBPHH Memorandum
   of Understanding (MOU) 900.
       3.2.3.1. All vehicles require inspection by the Wing ADPM to ensure all MOU 900
       requirements are met. ADPMs will document vehicle inspections via MFR.
   3.2.4. Vehicles operating in the AOA must be equipped with operational radio equipment
   capable of positive two-way communication with HNL Ground Control (Ground
   121.9/Tower 118.1). Operators must receive approval from ATCT prior to entering the
   AOA.
 26                                                               15WGI13-213 11 JULY 2013


      3.2.4.1. A hand-held radio will only be used as a backup or when communication is
      required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before
      entering the airfield.
   3.2.5. Vehicles operating on the airfield are assigned callsigns. All vehicle callsigns must be
   aproved by AM. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians operating on the AOA must use
   approved callsigns in Attachment 18 to avoid duplicating, confusing, or similar sounding
   callsigns by different agencies (i.e. Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.).
   3.2.6. The AOA/runways will not be used as a throughway for convenience to get from one
   side of the airfield to another. Vehicles will use the access road directly behind the alert
   facility connecting Taxiway Mike.
   3.2.7. Procedures and standards to comply with control tower light gun signals. In the event
   of radio failure or loss of communication on a runway/taxiway inside the AOA, the HNL
   Ground Control will turn the taxiway lights on and off or use light gun signals to
   communicate with aircraft or ground vehicles. Once alerted, or if a vehicle operator
   experiences a radio failure within the AOA, the vehicle operator will immediately exit the
   area by most direct path possible (do not cross runways without ATCT permission) and
   contact ATCT or AM by cellular telephone to advise of the situation. If this is not practical,
   the operator will point the vehicle toward the tower and flash headlights to indicate lost radio
   contact with ATCT, after exiting the AOA. All vehicle operators are required to know and
   comply with the light gun signals (see Figure 3.1).
   3.2.8. If HNL Ground Control is unable to contact vehicles, they will contact AM for
   assistance.
3.3. Procedures for Proper Radio Terminology/Phraseology and Discipline.
   3.3.1. Correct use of radio phraseology is extremely important. The phrase “Clear” shall not
   be used by personnel operating vehicles on the airfield. Instead, state “off the runway” or
   “requesting access/entry onto the runway” when contacting the ATCT for permission on/off
   the runway, taxiway and/or AOA.
   3.3.2. Vehicle operators will remain in radio contact with ATCT at all times while operating
   in the AOA. Everyone must communicate in the same manner to avoid confusion.
   Examples of correct and incorrect radio usage are described below:
      3.3.2.1. Incorrect language includes “10” codes, phrases like “10-4” and “What’s your
      20” are not used on airports; plain language is required. This terminology is not
      professional and results in confusion. Instead of “10-4” say, “I copy” or “I understand.”
      Avoid using personal names such as “Kathy, Jim, Jones or Smith”; there are too many
      people with the same or similar names. See Attachment 16 (International Phonetic
      Alphabet).
      3.3.2.2. Correct language is short, direct, precise and descriptive leaving no room for
      confusion or error. See figure 3.1. below for examples.
      3.3.2.3. Two-way radio communication is the primary way to communicate with the
      ATCT and is critical to flight safety. Ensure all ATCT instructions are heard and
      understood. If there is any doubt, ask for clarification.
15WGI13-213 11 JULY 2013                                                                                                             27


         3.3.2.4. All vehicles operating on the airfield will contain decals AFVA 11-240 or FAA
         Form 5280-7 depicting light-gun signals their meanings and current airfield diagram.
         Decals (AFVA 11-240 or FAA Form 5280-7) are available from AM in Building 2050.
         These decals may also be ordered from http://afpubs.hq.af.mil/profile/userlogin.aspx
         for     the    AFVA       11-240      or     FAA       Form     5280-7    products   at

3.4. Airfield Signs/Markings and Lighting.
    3.4.1. Signs and markings are standardized to meet all criteria required by the Air Force and
    Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
    3.4.2. Mandatory signs are provided when an instruction must be followed. A mandatory
    sign has white inscription on a red background.
    3.4.3. Informative signs are used to indicate a specific location or destination on an aircraft
    movement area, or to provide other useful information.               Taxiway Guidance and
    Informational Signs are yellow with black legend, indicating direction, destination, runway
    exit, clear of a boundary, or other information. Location Signs are yellow legend and border
    on black background, indicating the surface on which the aircraft is operating. While
    primarily indicating taxiway location, these also may be used to indicate runway location at
    potentially confusing areas.

3.6. Traffic Lane Procedures.
3.6.1. Traffic lanes are identified by solid white lines, with yellow dotted/dash lines in the
        middle dividing the lane; and are usually located parallel to aircraft parking
rows. Vehicles within a traffic lane will drive in one direction. Operate vehicles in a single-file
   on traffic lanes at all times unless in direct support of an aircraft or when responding to an
                                              emergency.
   3.6.2. The centerline areas of the taxiway or taxilanes are reserved as safety lanes and kept
   clear of vehicles and equipment. The only vehicles authorized to operate on the centerline of
15WGI13-213 11 JULY 2013                                                                          31


   a taxiway include, but are not limited to, Airfield Management vehicles, Flight Safety
   vehicles, airfield sweepers and vehicles towing aircraft. All other vehicles will use taxiway
   shoulders if available and/or the edge of taxilanes to transit to and from areas on the airfield.
3.7. Procedures for Operating a Vehicle in the Vicinity of Aircraft.
   3.7.1. No vehicle will be left unattended or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet
   to the rear of any aircraft when engines are in operation. Note: An aircraft’s anti-collision
   light must be operating prior to engine start and taxi.
   3.7.2. If a vehicle is operated within 25 feet of an aircraft the driver must turn in a direction
   with the driver’s side toward the aircraft.
   3.7.3. Do not drive vehicles within 10 feet of a parked aircraft unless the vehicle is required
   for ground servicing. Use of a spotter and pre-positioned chocks are required within 10 feet
   of an aircraft. The delivery of coffee, meals, etc., does not qualify as ground servicing.
   Refer to AFMAN 24-306_IP, Chapter 25 and applicable technical orders.
   3.7.4. Under no circumstance will a vehicle stop in front of, or drive into the path of a
   moving aircraft with the exception of “guide” or “follow-me” vehicles. No vehicles will be
   driven between an aircraft and the “follow-me” vehicle.
   3.7.5. Vehicles transporting distinguished visitors may approach aircraft with the passenger
   side facing the aircraft, but not closer than 25 feet from the nearest point of the aircraft.
   3.7.6. When approaching or being approached by taxiing aircraft, exit taxiway or move from
   aircraft path at next paved surface (time permitting) until the aircraft is well clear of your
   vehicle. If it is necessary to drive off the paved surface, the operator is responsible for
   checking the vehicle tires for FOD material and ensuring all tires and paved surface are clear
   of FOD. Accomplish this check immediately upon returning to the paved surface.
   3.7.7. Vehicle operators will not drive between aircraft and personnel marshalling aircraft.
3.8. Parking and Chocking Requirements.
   3.8.1. Extreme caution must be used during reverse operations around aircraft. Vehicles
   reversing up to an aircraft must have chocks in position and a spotter or marshalling
   assistance during the entire maneuver.
   3.8.2. Vehicles will park in a manner as to eliminate the possibility of striking an aircraft,
   should a vehicle inadvertently roll backward or forward. Vehicles will park as such to
   restrict reverse operations near aircraft. Servicing vehicles (i.e., Fleet Service, ambus, fuel
   truck, etc., due to design or particular operation) are required to park perpendicular to the
   aircraft, and therefore are exempt.
   3.8.3. The driver will perform the following steps when exiting the vehicle:
       3.8.3.1. Turn off the ignition, set the parking brake, place a manual transmission in
       reverse or an automatic transmission in park, and leave the keys in the ignition.
       3.8.3.2. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment without an integral
       braking system when left unattended on aircraft-parking ramps.
   3.8.4. Aircraft must be chocked and engines shut down on the appropriate side before stair
   trucks/boarding ramps are positioned.
 32                                                              15WGI13-213 11 JULY 2013


   3.8.5. Vehicles will not park north of the Alert Facility (near guard shack) with the driver’s
   seat vacated.
   3.8.6. Vehicles parked within 10 feet of any aircraft will have one rear wheel chocked fore
   and aft with parking brake applied.
3.9. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles.
   3.9.1. All vehicles operating in/or around the airfield are considered mobile obstacles.
   Maintenance vehicles and emergency vehicles operating on ramps/aprons and in the AOA
   have special separation standards and are not addressed in this section. Other vehicles
   operating on the airfield must comply with the following:
   3.9.2. The lateral clearance distance from taxiway/taxilane centerline to parked or moving
   vehicles is 200 feet. When operating off the edges of a taxiway do not park or operate a
   vehicle within 200 feet of the taxiway center line. No vehicle will be parked and left
   unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline.
   3.9.3. The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all ramps and aprons to a mobile
   obstacle is 50 feet from the wingtip of any aircraft. When operating off the edges of a ramp
   or apron do not park or operate a vehicle within 50 feet of wingtip clearance of any taxilane
   or possible aircraft movement. To ensure separation from any aircraft in the Air Force
   inventory, vehicles will park a minimum of 125 feet from edge of pavement.
   3.9.4. The lateral clearance distance from the runway centerline is 1000 feet. This area is
   located within the AOA and radio contact with the ATCT must be established and
   maintained at all times. When operating within this area, do not park and leave a vehicle
   unattended.
3.10. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
3.10.1. Drivers must abide by ATCT light gun signals. Decals and airfield diagrams are required
   in all vehicles operating on the airfield. Decals (AFVA 11-240 or FAA Form 5280-7) are
          available from AM in Building 2050. These decals may also be ordered from
  http://afpubs.hq.af.mil/profile/userlogin.aspx for the AFVA 11-240 or FAA Form 5280-7
                products at http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/order/order.cfm
   3.10.2. Light Gun Signals are as follows:

   3.10.3. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the
   inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle, so it may be flipped down and
   ready for reference.
   3.10.4. All airfield vehicle operators will know and comply with all airfield signs, markings
   and ATCT signals.
3.11. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control/Prevention.
   3.11.1. Vehicles must come to a complete stop before entering the airfield. The vehicle
   operator will turn off the vehicle, exit the vehicle and perform a thorough roll over FOD
   check before proceeding onto the airfield. Conducting a roll over FOD check consists of:
       3.11.1.1. Inspecting vehicle tires. Pull vehicle forward to check the portion of tires in

                             PASSES

6.1. Procedures for Issuing, Maintaining and Securing POV Vehicle Passes.
   6.1.1. POVs on the airfield are highly discouraged and are restricted to an absolute
   minimum. POVs shall not be authorized to operate in the AOA.
   6.1.2. Personnel requesting airfield POV passes must be certified to drive on the airfield and
   have an AF Form 483. The hosting unit will provide the training and maintain all
   documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-01, Rule 01.00. The AFM,
   Wing ADPM or designated AM representatives is responsible for issuing vehicle passes.
   Authority will not be delegated outside of AM.
      6.1.2.1. Personnel will complete Attachment 7 for temporary POV pass or Attachment 8
      for permanent POV pass. When completed, the letter will be forwarded to the Wing
      ADPM. The Wing ADPM will review and approve the request to ensure it meets AF
      guidance. Passes will not be issued directly to contract personnel; only the wing/base
      representative may sign for contractor airfield access identification.
   6.1.3. Numbered and color-coded passes are issued/used to control and readily identify
   authorized POVs/GLVs on the Hickam airfield. Government vehicles do not require a POV
   pass. Note: GLVs are vehicles rented or leased by government agencies for an official
   purpose.
   6.1.4. POV passes have a unique number assigned to a specific vehicle and may not be used
   on any other vehicle. If the POV is sold or transferred to another individual, the vehicle pass
   must be returned to Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS). The responsibility for
   security and safekeeping of the pass lies with the holder.
   6.1.5. Contractors approved to operate POVs on the airfield will be issued an airfield
   temporary POV pass by the AFM and/or Wing ADPM only. Pass must be visible at all
   times. Display the pass on the left side (driver’s side) of the dashboard visible when the
   vehicle is on the airfield. Passes will be placed on the dash of the vehicle only for the period
   that the vehicle is on the airfield, and must be removed upon departure from the airfield.
   NOTE: Contract/commercial vehicles must be plainly marked with company ID/Logo if
   operating on the airfield.
   6.1.6. Due to safety concerns, keep the number of contractor vehicles, authorized to operate
   on the airfield, to the absolute minimum. The Wing ADPM is the approval authority for
   additional vehicles.
   6.1.7. Passes are the responsibility of the persons to whom they are issued. Passes will not
   be transferred to without coordination/approval of Airfield Management.
6.2. Permanently Issued POV Vehicle Passes.
   6.2.1. Personnel whose duties require a permanent vehicle pass will complete the Permanent
   POV Pass Request Memorandum in Attachment 8. This letter will be signed by the unit
   commander. When completed, forward the letter to the Wing ADPM. The Wing ADPM
 44                                                                15WGI13-213 11 JULY 2013


   will review and approve the request to ensure it meets AF guidance. Note: Permanent passes
   are not applicable to GLVs.
   6.2.2. If approved, the Wing ADPM will issue a permanent POV vehicle pass to the
   requestor. Display the pass on the left side (driver’s side) of the dashboard visible when the
   vehicle is on the airfield. Permanent POV vehicle passes will be signed for and are only
   valid for the current calendar year and must be re-validated annually no later than (NLT) 19
   December every year. All approved passes for the next year will be ready for pick up
   between 27-29 December every year. The vehicle pass will change color to ensure that the
   integrity of the pass is maintained. If the request is disapproved, the Wing ADPM will notify
   the requestor.
   6.2.3. Permanent POV vehicle passes are controlled items.
   6.2.4. The Wing ADPM will provide a list of all permanently issued POV vehicle passes
   with the following information to the 647 SFS Installation Security Section: rank/name, unit,
   duty phone, make/model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle the POV vehicle pass
   will be used for. This list will be updated anytime a change is made to the listing.
   6.2.5. Wing ADPM will maintain a file listing of all issued POV passes IAW Air Force
   RDS, Table 13-01 Rule 01.00.
6.3. Temporary Issue POV/GLV Vehicle Passes.
   6.3.1. A limited number of temporary POV vehicle passes are available to be signed out
   from AM. Personnel signing out vehicle passes must meet all the training requirements in
   this ADI. Personnel will complete Attachment 7. When completed, forward letter to the
   Wing ADPM. The Wing ADPM will review and approve the request to ensure it meets AF
   guidance.
   6.3.2. When a temporary POV pass is approved by Wing ADPM (Attachment 7 signed by
   Wing ADPM), AM personnel will log driver/vehicle information on the temporary POV pass
   log and issue the pass.
   6.3.3. Drivers will display the pass on the left side (driver’s side) of the dashboard so that it
   is visible when the vehicle is on the airfield.
   6.3.4. After exiting the airfield, remove the pass from the dashboard and secure it. Return the
   pass to AMOPs when there is no longer a valid need for it.
   6.3.5. Temporary POV passes are controlled items.
   6.3.6. The Wing ADPM will provide a list of all temporarily issued POV pass with the same
   information in paragraph 6.3.2 to the 647 SFS Installation Security Section. This list will
   be updated anytime a change is made to the listing.
