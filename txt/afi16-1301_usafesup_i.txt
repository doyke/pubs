SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The original
instruction only addressed Survival and Code of Conduct (CoC) Training. In this revision,
continuation training was added to the CoC section and four chapters were added addressing
general program information, Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support, career field
management, and SERE program evaluation and inspection.

                                           Chapter 1

                           THE AIR FORCE SERE PROGRAM

1.1. General Issues. This instruction:
   1.1.1. Applies to all MAJCOMs and ANG.
   1.1.2. Defines minimum Code of Conduct Training (CoCT) and Code of Conduct
   Continuation Training (CoCCT) requirements for United States Air Force (USAF) personnel.
   1.1.3. Lists overall Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support responsibilities and defines
   roles and duties of Air Force SERE Specialists (1T000/1T0X1) in support of PR.
   1.1.4. Defines roles and responsibilities for SERE Specialist career field management.
   1.1.5. Defines procedures for evaluating and inspecting key aspects of the Air Force SERE
   Program.
1.2. Program Explanation:
   1.2.1. This instruction describes the Air Force SERE Program as a function within DoD PR.
   The Air Force SERE program encompasses CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support
   required to enable military, civilian, contractor, and other designated personnel to return to
   friendly control after isolation due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other unforeseen
   events. The sole purpose of the AF SERE Program is to support PR operations through
   education, training, and operational support activities. Specifically, the Universal Joint Task
   List (UJTL), Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMTEL), and applicable Air Force tasks for
   conducting personnel recovery operations drive SERE Program requirements. Doctrinally,
   the PR continuum is comprised of education and training, mission planning, execution,
   tracking, debriefing, repatriating, and applying applicable lessons learned. The SERE
   Program begins and closes the PR continuum beginning with initial SERE training and
   culminating with repatriation.
       1.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The Guardian Angel Weapon System encompasses three
       career fields: Combat Rescue Officer, Pararescue, and SERE Specialists. The role of
       SERE Specialists within Guardian Angel is to support Air Force Combat Search and
       Rescue and Joint Personnel Recovery (PR) mission areas through effective execution of
       the SERE Triad: initial training, refresher training, and operations. SERE Specialists are
       employed in the following areas within USAFE: HQ USAFE/A3, Air and Space
       Operations Center, Rescue Squadron, Contingency Response Group, and Operational
       Support Squadrons to support Combat Air Forces and Mobility Air Forces.
   1.2.2. CoCT Goals and Objectives.
       1.2.2.1. The goal of CoCT is to prepare personnel to return with honor, regardless of the
       circumstances of isolation.
       1.2.2.2. The objective of CoCT is to provide a clear and direct SERE/PR linkage from
       initial through refresher and continuation training, exercises, and combat operations to
       ensure efficient training and effective support occur throughout the member's career.
 6                                                   AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


        1.2.2.3. The Code of Conduct (CoC) is the foundation underpinning the warfighter’s
        PR/SERE preparation and training. AF CoCT programs must prepare USAF personnel
        for all forms of modern contingencies, from wartime to Operations Other Than War
        (OOTW).
        1.2.2.4. Any event that places any US forces member in a situation where he or she is
        isolated and no longer in friendly control triggers the need for PR. These triggering
        events can occur through hostile enemy actions during OOTW, terrorist actions, or as a
        result of natural or manmade conditions. The Air Force SERE Program is an integral part
        of an organized PR effort among several related functions.
        1.2.2.5. AF SERE program must provide the necessary PR information prior to and
        during contingency operations to USAF personnel at risk of capture. Isolated personnel
        increase their chance of an expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when
        they are trained to perform PR Joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (JTTPs).
1.3. Supplements and Waivers.
     1.3.1. MAJCOM, ANG, and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) functional managers will
     supplement this instruction within 12 months of the publication date of this instruction.
     Forward a copy of their supplement to this publication to HQ USAF/A3OS, 1480 Air Force
     Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.
     1.3.2. Waiver authority for this instruction is HQ USAF/A3OS unless otherwise stated.
     MAJCOMs, ANG, and DRUs may request waivers and/or deviations to requirements of this
     instruction when unique or unusual circumstances affect the unit’s ability to implement stated
     policy or procedure. MAJCOMs, ANG, and DRUs will forward the request by letter or
     message to HQ USAF/A3OS explaining why a waiver is needed and describing the specific
     requirement that is creating the problem. Wings will process waivers through their
     respective MAJCOM authority for submission to HQ USAF/A3OS. Wings (operations
     group commander or higher) may request waivers to MAJCOM supplements by submitting
     their waiver request to the specific MAJCOM.
        1.3.2.1. Formal Initial CoCT. HQ USAF/A3OS is waiver authority for courses S-V80-
        A, S-V81-A, S-V84-A, S-V86-A, S-V87-A, S-V90-A, and SERE Indoctrination Course
        (SEREIC). HQ JPRA is waiver authority for courses S-V91-A and S-V93-A. HQ
        USAF/A2ZC is waiver authority for S-V83-A.
        1.3.2.2. CoCCT. MAJCOM/DO is waiver authority for the CoCCT program.
        1.3.2.3. If approved, waivers remain in effect for the amount of time needed to correct
        the problem causing the waiver requirement, not to exceed 1 year. The approving agency
        may cancel the waiver in writing if issues change the basic intent/requirement for the
        waiver.
        1.3.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Waiver requests for courses S-V80-A, S-V81-A, S-V84-A, S-
        V86-A, S-V87-A, and S-V90-A, will be coordinated through HQ USAFE/A3TO to HQ
        USAF/A3OS. Waiver requests for course S-V83-A will be coordinated through HQ
        USAFE/A3TO and to HQ USAF/A2ZC.
            1.3.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Waivers may extend the due date by a maximum of one
            year and will not delete the requirement to accomplish the given event. The decision

  training standards in Nov 2010. Definitions for Level B in AFI16-1301, 6 Sept 2006, are
  obsolete.
     2.2.4.1. Combatant commanders will identify personnel requiring level-B CoCT prior to
     deploying to their respective theaters. HQ USAF/A3OS will pass these requirements to
     MAJCOMs as information becomes available.
 20                                               AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


      2.2.4.1. (USAFE) Current acceptable courseware for level-A CoCT is the SERE 100.1
      unclassified CBT available through the Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) page
      http://jko.jfcom.mil under the ―Take Courses‖ tab, course number ―J3T A-US022‖.
         2.2.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SERE 100 is a legacy-training product that still meets
         Level-A criteria. Combatant Commands determine training requirements for theater
         entry and may be more restrictive. Refer to the foreign clearance guide for specific
         AOR requirements.
      2.2.4.2. Level-B SERE CoCT can be accomplished through formal courses (AFSOC
      SERE CoCT Course, or through the USAFSAM SERE CoCT Course) or by viewing
      JPRA level-B training tapes.
      2.2.4.2. (USAFE) Level-B training can no longer be conducted via Computer Based
      Training or training videos.
         2.2.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Level-B training certification is received by attending
         Evasion and Conduct After Capture (ECAC) or other Level B in-resident school
         designated by HQ USAF/A3OS. To request service-equivalent training credit,
         provide course details to HQ USAFE/A3TO, usafe.a3to@ramstein.af.mil.
      2.2.4.3. Track aircrew level-B CoCT utilizing ARMS. Track level-B CoCT for non-
      aircrew IAW MAJCOM, base, and/or unit guidance.
      2.2.4.3. (USAFE) Personnel who have attended Level C SERE training and receive
      SS03 regularly to maintain Combat Mission Ready status are exempt from recurring
      CoCT training theater entry requirements.
      2.2.4.4. Coordinate efforts to obtain training tapes and credit for training through
      respective SERE MFMs.
      2.2.4.5. SERE MFMs and designated units can obtain level-B, Wartime Code of Conduct
      Series, Peacetime Governmental and Peacetime Hostage Detention CoCT tapes by
      contacting AF/A3OS with their requirements.
2.3. Code of Conduct Continuation Training (CoCCT) Program Management:
   2.3.1. CoCCT Intent:
      2.3.1.1. CoCCT is a combination of refresher CoCT and additional theater specific
      Contingency SERE Indoctrination (CSI) training. Frequency and depth of training are
      based on missions conducted (and associated perceived threats) of personnel requiring
      training. MAJCOMs and the ANG will tailor curriculum and training to meet minimum
      requirements levied by this publication and IAW combatant command guidance.
      2.3.1.2. CoCCT is designed to ensure personnel maintain critical SERE skills gained at
      formal SERE training courses and to tailor SERE skills for specific aircraft, missions, and
      deployed locations.
      2.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) S-V80A, SERE Training incorporated significant curriculum
      changes since publication of AFI 16-1301, 6 Sept 2006. During initial training, personnel
      now receive indoctrination in Apprehension Avoidance/Escape Enhancement (A2/E2)
      skills. These perishable skills must be maintained during CoCCT to be effective.
AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                         21


     Integrate Apprehension Avoidance into Combat Survival Training (SS02). Integrate
     Escape Enhancement into Conduct After Capture (SS03).
     2.3.1.4. (Added-USAFE) When conducted properly, A2E2 presents no more risk than
     other field skills exercised during Combat Survival Training. Commanders must integrate
     ORM measures for A2E2 into existing processes. Due to increased safety considerations,
     deviation from USAFE standardized Instructor Guides must be approved by HQ

     CoC and SERE training specialists."
     2.3.2.2. 1T0X1, SERE Specialists are the only Air Force specialty specifically recruited,
     trained, and employed to conduct SERE operations support, CoCT, and CoCCT for the
     duration of their career.
     2.3.2.3. Where SERE specialists aren't assigned, available, or additional manpower is
     required, SERE MFMs in coordination with affected MFMs may authorize other
     designated personnel to support this requirement. All CoCCT instructors will be
     qualified and certified IAW SERE training plans. The SERE MFM will coordinate
     MAJCOM specific training requirements for unit level CoCCT instructors with the
     respective MFM(s) for inclusion into their Master JQS/CFETP.
     2.3.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Wing operational missions determine focus of training; align
     SERE Specialists within supporting organizations to provide maximum access to mission
     planning activities. SERE Specialists must communicate with wing training (OST) to
     ensure SERE ground training events are met. Whenever possible, conduct SERE ground
     training events as PR readiness exercises and include findings in quarterly reports to
     OG/CC
     2.3.2.5. (Added-USAFE) SERE Specialists will use USAFE approved instructor guides
     unless waivered by HQ USAFE/A3TO when conducting CoCCT. Instructor guides are
     available from a collaborative online library with restricted access. Contact the SERE
     MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) for access.
     2.3.2.6. (Added-USAFE) In lieu of available SERE Specialists, augmenting personnel
     may be trained IAW local training program to perform limited instructional duties and
     mitigate ORM concerns. Develop a training plan in accordance with attachment 5 and
     document progression through certification. Non-SERE augmenters may not teach SS-03
     Conduct after Capture. The assigned SERE Specialist will certify augmenters with a 1-
     year currency. Documentation of evaluations and certifications will be maintained for
     the duration of certification.
     2.3.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Equipment used during all CoCCT events will mirror
     operational equipment carried aboard assigned MDS to the greatest extent possible.
     NOTE: MDS specific survival equipment used exclusively for CoCCT does not fall
     under the same inspection cycles as operational gear. Repair equipment for training as
     needed in accordance with applicable Technical Orders, or establish a repair

            2.3.4.7.1. CSI is a combatant command-directed activity and is designed to prepare
            HRC personnel deploying to a specific theater of operations or contingency. CSI will
            be tailored to the specific mission, e.g., fighters, transport aircraft, or ground forces.
            Combatant commands will certify selected SERE specialists to instruct HRC theater
            preparations. CSI is also referred to as HRC theater preparation.
            2.3.4.7.2. CSI should be accomplished within 60 days prior to deployment.
            2.3.4.7.2. (USAFE) CSI (SS07), also known as High Risk of Isolation (HRI), is
            COCOM directed pre-mission preparation. Instructors may elect to integrate SS03
            line items and dual-log SS07 and SS03. If dual logging, both events must be logged
            on an AF1522, Aviation Resource Management System Additional Training
            Accomplishment Report, and personnel certified in both SS07 and SS03 must conduct
            the event.     Completion of SS03 alone does not meet requirements for SS07.
            Document Area of Operation briefed on the SS07 AF1522. For CSI/HRI briefings
            provided to non-Air Force units, retain substantiating documentation consisting of
            tasking request and class roster for 1 year.

                    SERE PROGRAM PR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT

3.1. General Concepts of PR Operational Support:
3.1. (USAFE) Concept of Employment. SERE support to PR operations covers the spectrum
of engagements from regional conflict to small-scale contingencies (SSC) and consists of three
mission areas that form the SERE triad. These include (1) preparation through CoC training, pre-
mission briefings and equipment (2) planning from staff to unit level; (3) and execution of PR
operations. Deployed responsibilities include: assignment to the joint personnel recovery center
(JPRC), personnel recovery coordination cell (PRCC) or equivalent; unit level positions in
operational flying units, rescue squadrons, sister service or allied units, and Special Operations
Forces/Other Government Agencies elements as requested. Actions taken prior to mission
execution are designed to facilitate planning and preparation for possible IP events and the
ensuing PR mission. SERE Specialists will assist in all facets of PR mission planning by
ensuring incorporation of all available and pertinent SERE information. Actions taken after
recovery facilitate reintegration and ensure lessons learned are documented and forwarded.
Procedures for the mission areas may overlap and each specific operating location may have
collateral support requirements identified and supported by the assigned SERE Specialist.
   3.1.1. The AF SERE Program supports PR requirements reflected in Chairman of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3270.01, Personnel Recovery Within the Department of
   Defense (classified), DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery, Joint Publication (JP) 3-
   50.3, Joint Doctrine for Evasion and Recovery (E&R), and JP 3-50.21, Joint Tactics,
   Techniques, and Procedures (JTTP) for CSAR. NOTE: PR operational support was
   formerly known as Evasion and Recovery (E&R) or Escape and Evasion (E&E) and includes
   duties related to conventional and non-conventional assisted recovery (NAR) IAW DoDI
   2310.6, Non-Conventional Assisted Recovery in the Department of Defense.3.1.1.1. PR
   operational support programs consist of: all actions taken prior to mission execution to equip
   and facilitate planning for warfighters’ SERE and PR efforts in the event of isolation, actions
   taken after isolation to plan and execute PR, and actions taken after recovery to ensure
   lessons learned are documented and incorporated into TTP.
       3.1.1.1. Unit-level operational support programs are executed by SERE, Intelligence and
       Aircrew Life Support functions. Specifically, SERE specialists employed in PR
       operational support programs will:
       3.1.1.1. (USAFE) To ensure OG readiness, units will not normally be tasked beyond the
       capacity to maintain currency in CoCCT and perform organic PR planning. During
       contingency operations, affected units must keep at least one SERE Specialist on station
       to provide Personnel Recovery (PR) planning and PR liaison duties. When OGs are
       manned with only one SERE Specialist, the posturing or ―P‖ code will be changed to
       ―DXX‖ to prevent deploying the only OG SERE capability.
           3.1.1.1.1. Provide SME, policy guidance, and oversight of Evasion Plans of Action
           (EPA), Isolated Personnel Reports (ISOPREP), Evasion Charts, Blood Chits, and PR
           Kits to ensure compliance with directives. Units will delineate responsibilities of
           Intelligence and SERE Specialists.
AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                          33


          3.1.1.1.1. (USAFE) Unit level Intelligence personnel conduct day-to-day up keep
          and maintenance of Evasion Plans of Action (EPA), Isolated Personnel Reports
          (ISOPREP), Evasion Charts, Blood Chits and PR Kits as utilized for daily unit
          missions. Unit level SERE Specialists will provide subject matter expertise in
          development of PR Kits and will conduct required maintenance for perishable items.
          Conduct regular reviews of Aircrew Flight Equipment to identify excess
          redundancies.
             3.1.1.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Unit level SERE Specialists, Aircrew Flight
             Equipment, and the Intelligence Evasion and Recovery (E&R) training program
             manager will coordinate responsibility for E&R training/support and document
             delineation of duties in a Memorandum for Record.
          3.1.1.1.2. Identify PR unique intelligence requirements.
          3.1.1.1.3. Provide SERE subject matter expertise to the Joint Search and Rescue
          Center (JSRC), Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), or equivalent organization to
          develop SERE and PR JTTP.

          identify and incorporate appropriate aircrew life support and survival equipment
          required for successful PR.
          3.1.1.1.5. As an integral part of PR repatriation plans, SERE SMEs will ensure
          repatriation debriefings are applied at the tactical level and included in theater
          briefings during contingency operations. Additionally, SERE SMEs will ensure
          repatriation after action/lessons learned are included in entry level CoCT and CoCCT.

                                          Chapter 4

                 SERE SPECIALIST CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT

4.1. Other SERE Specialist Missions and Responsibilities. This chapter addresses general
mission employment, training requirements, physical fitness standards, and additional issues not
discussed in other documents such as in the SERE Specialty Description in AFMAN 36-2108,
training requirements in the CFETP, or other AFIs. SERE specialists will be qualified as a
worldwide deployable resource capable of supporting operations in any theater as a SME in
support of PR/SERE operations.
4.2. Parachuting Program:
   4.2.1. SERE personnel conduct static line and military free fall (MFF) operations.
   Sustainability for parachute program includes basic, senior and master parachutists, and
   upgrade to MFF jumpmaster throughout the AFSC. SERE specialists will implement and
   maintain their Personnel Parachute Program IAW AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute
   Operations. MAJCOMs will establish specific command requirements to support aircrew
   emergency parachuting activities.
   4.2.2. SERE specialist parachutist duty requirements include performing and instructing
   emergency egress, emergency parachute systems, and aircrew emergency parachuting during
   initial SERE CoCT and CoCCT programs. NOTE: As reflected in paragraph 2.3.4.6.4 of
   this instruction, primary instructors for this training will be graduates of a US military
   parachutist course and freefall experience is highly desired.
   4.2.2. (USAFE) OG commanders will ensure funds are available for assigned SERE
   Specialists who are jump qualified, to accomplish a minimum of one jump per quarter, or
   four jumps per year for each parachute qualification (static-line/freefall) held to maintain
   proficiency and skill progression.
   4.2.3. Advanced parachuting skills may be required for SERE specialist parachutist duties
   including: performance in developmental/operational testing of experimental parachuting
   systems, aircraft parachutist deployment testing, and emergency egress with associated
   SERE/aircrew life support equipment; instructor duties at the Army Military Freefall School;
   and EPT for PR exercise mission accomplishment.
   4.2.4. Advanced skills take years of training that require parachutist skills to be
   supplemented with proficiency training integrated into all MAJCOMs. The goal of
   proficiency training is to provide expertise for advance parachutist experience requirements
   and to provide a stable force ready for advanced parachutist positions.
       4.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) SERE Specialists will maintain an informal jump record
       folder that contains all parachute training and evaluation documents, including the
       following:

   4.2.5. HQ AFMC's Test Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB CA provides
   intentional aircrew emergency parachuting qualification training for conducting
   developmental and operational tests and evaluations. The TPP is the center of expertise for
   aircrew emergency bailout procedures/operations.
4.3. SERE Specialist Qualification Training Program:
4.3. (USAFE) The 1T0X1 training requirements have changed significantly over the past 5
years. As a result, many SERE Specialists currently lack appropriate skill levels or Mission
Ready qualifications. Mission Ready certification is a deployment requirement and thus the
highest priority when allocating funds for the SERE program. SERE Specialists will not be
considered for unit funded advanced qualifications (Freefall, Jumpmaster, MACP Level 3)
unless minimum skill level and mission ready qualifications are completed. SERE MFM may
waive this policy in extenuating circumstances.
   4.3.1. SERE specialists must perform challenging training and exercise activities and must
   be mission ready for worldwide deployment. Therefore, all personnel must maintain the
   capability to provide SERE training regardless of climatic and environmental conditions. All
   SERE specialists, 5-skill level and higher, will maintain mission ready status by reviewing
   and performing the following proficiency/currency requirements using the associated CFETP
   core task and line items as the baseline for refresher training. Method of refresher training
   accomplishment will be MAJCOM directed:
   4.3.1. (USAFE) Land Navigation and Biome training will not be conducted within the local
   training range, as the intent is to develop and maintain diverse expertise to match various
   contingency locations. When possible, additional benefits can be gained by conducting land
   navigation and biome training at other USAFE Wing locations and abroad for adverse terrain
   exposure. This allows the opportunity for cross tell/information exchange and integration of
   best practices.
       4.3.1.1. Land Navigation - Biennial.
       4.3.1.1. (USAFE) Navigation proficiency/currency activities will include hands-on
       performance of navigation principles to include travel using a map and compass, GPS,
       celestial aids, as well as night navigation TTPs. Currency: 24 months
       4.3.1.2. Medical - Biennial. Training will include emergency first aid refresher and
       include performance of ground search and emergency rough land patient transport and
       evacuation TTP.
       4.3.1.3. Environmental/Biome - Biennial.
 40                                                AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


       4.3.1.3. (USAFE) Environmental/Biome (Arctic, Desert, Tropics, Temperate or
       Coastal/Open Ocean) proficiency requirements will be maintained by experiencing at
       least one different environment per biennial event. Training will incorporate various
       SERE TTPs identified in the 1T0X1 CFETP for the applicable environment. Currency:
       24 months
       4.3.1.4. Conduct after capture guidance for wartime, peacetime governmental, and
       hostage captivity – Biennial, (unless conducting regular duties as an RT instructor). This
       can be accomplished by observing the RT portion of Combat Survival Training, S-V80-
       A, by monitoring/attending the JPRA Joint Resistance Training Instructor Course
       (JRTIC), or by participating in other similar events or courses.
       4.3.1.4. (USAFE) Conduct after Capture TTPs refresher training will be accomplished
       by observing the resistance training portion of course S-V80-A, Evasion and Conduct
       After Capture (ECAC), or similar role-play instruction approved by SERE MFM.
       4.3.1.5. PR JTTP - Biennial. This can be accomplished by deploying for contingency
       operations, performing SERE escort/controller duties in a PR exercise, or through unit
       level training.
   4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Multiple refresher training requirements can be combined into one
   trip or TDY to ensure cost effective budgeting, i.e. supporting a Red Flag exercise as an
   Observer Controller could provide credit for both biome (desert) and navigation proficiency
   requirements.
   4.3.3. (Added-USAFE) USAFE SERE Specialists supporting aircrew should observe a full
   mission planning cycle for their supported airframes; if possible, observe a combat mission
   planning cycle during unit exercises. For multi-place aircraft, SERE should fly with their
   crews at least semi-annually. Use Mission Essential Ground Personnel status if required. The
   objective is to follow the crews as they prepare for and plan missions so they can tailor their
   training to be current with the crew’s needs.
4.4. Physical Fitness Test:
   4.4.1. Successful execution of the SERE specialist missions requires a high degree of
   physical fitness beginning with entry level training (S-V81-A) and continuing throughout a
   member’s career. The unique SERE mission requires optimum individual performance in
   areas of adverse terrain, every environmental condition, and airborne operations. These
   conditions require mental and physical capabilities be maintained at a high level.
   Commanders will ensure assigned SERE specialists complete at least 5 hours of fitness
   training weekly. Commanders will utilize the following standards to assess and maintain
   overall fitness levels:
   4.4.2. SERE specialists will be assessed annually. The fitness test consists of push-ups, sit-
   ups, pull-ups and 2-mile run. Point values for the events are shown in Table 4.1, Physical
   Fitness Evaluation Criteria. A minimum of 210 points is necessary for satisfactory
   completion. Grading criteria are as follows: 520-395 points = Outstanding, 390-280
   points=Excellent, 275-210 points=Satisfactory. Additionally, an alternate 6-mile ruck march
   or 800-meter swim may be used in lieu of the 2-mile run. Points associated with the 6-mile
   ruck march and 800-meter swim are outlined within the related paragraph. Calisthenics
   events will be tested, one immediately after the other, with approximately a 2-minute time
AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                            41


   rest between events. Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of approximately 10
   minutes is given prior to starting the 2–mile run, 6-mile ruck march or 800-meter swim.
   4.4.2. (USAFE) Annual SERE Specialist physical fitness test may be conducted by the unit
   physical fitness monitor or anyone in the member’s chain-of-command. Point calculations
   for annual SERE Specialist physical assessments are completed as follows. Airman
   completes 55 pushups, 55 sit-ups, 10 pull-ups and completes his run in 16 minutes. Each of
   his callisthenic exercises is worth 65 points and his run receives 160 points. The calculation
   of points would be 65+65+65+160=355 total points.

       4.4.2.1. Pull–ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise is executed on a pull–up bar.
       The individual grasps the bar with the palms toward the face about shoulder width apart.
       This is a two-count exercise. The exercise begins in the ―dead hang‖ position. Count one,
       pull the body directly upward until the chin is over the bar. Count two, lower the body
       until the body is again in the ―dead hang‖ position. Individuals will not swing
       excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled over the bar. Repeat as many times as
       possible. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in the back and
       biceps muscles.
       4.4.2.2. Sit–ups (time limit: 4 minutes). Start with the back flat on the ground, fingers
       interlocked behind the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90-
       degree angle. Another individual will hold the feet during the exercise. This is a two-

     count exercise. Count one, sit up until the back is vertical to the ground. Count two,
     return to the starting position. There is no authorized rest position. If an individual raises
     buttocks from ground or their fingers are not interlocked behind head during a repetition,
     the repetition is not counted. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance
     in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups.
     4.4.2.3. Push-ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise starts from the front leaning rest
     position. The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together.
     This is a two-count exercise. Count one, flex the elbows, lowering the body until the
     elbows form a 90-degree angle. Count two, raise the body until the elbows are straight
     and locked. Repeat this exercise as many times as possible. Event is stopped if an
     individual touches a knee to the ground. The only authorized rest position is the starting
     position. This exercise is designed to measure the strength and endurance of the chest
     and triceps muscles.
     4.4.2.4. Two-Mile Run. This is performed with running shoes and appropriate athletic
     attire. This event will be performed on flat, level, hard-surfaced terrain. This exercise is
     designed to measure aerobic endurance.
  4.4.3. Substandard Performance. Due to the potential risk to the SERE specialist and
  those they work with, minimum fitness standard must be met in order to control factors
  associated with ORM. SERE specialists who fail to achieve the minimum standard on the
  SERE physical fitness test (SPFT) will satisfactorily complete the entire evaluation within 60
  calendar days of the failure. Those who fail the rstest should not be considered for
  worldwide deployment, field operations under adverse conditions, or airborne duty. A
  review board will be convened after the second failure.
  4.4.3. (USAFE) Units will inform the SERE MFM within seven days if any SERE
  Specialist fails to satisfactory complete the AFS physical fitness test
  4.4.4. Review Board.
     4.4.4.1. The review board will consist of the unit operations officer, SERE MFM, and
     one senior enlisted SERE specialist designated by the SERE MFM.
     4.4.4.2. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a situation and
     provide an impartial judgment.
     4.4.4.3. The review board will determine the circumstances and adequacy of training and
     submit recommendations to the commander for further action. Recommendations may
     include additional supervised training, counseling, or other administrative actions. Board
     findings will be maintained on file for 18 months.
  4.4.5. Temporary Profiles. A member with a temporary profile must take the regular four-
  event fitness test after the profile has expired. (Members with temporary profiles of more
  than 3 months may take an alternate test as determined by the commander with input from
  health-care personnel.) Once the profile is lifted, the SERE specialist must be given twice
  the time of the profile (but not more than 90 days) to train for the fitness test. For example, if
  the profile period was 7 days, the SERE specialist has 14 days to train for the SPFT after the
  profile period ends. If a normally scheduled SPFT occurs during the profile period, the
  SERE specialist should be given a mandatory make-up date.
 AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                               43


    4.4.6. Permanent Profiles. Members who have been given a permanent profile by Air
    Force health professionals will be exempt from the SPFT. In the event that the member is
    returned to duty with no profile, he/she must take the SPFT within 90 days unless otherwise
    indicated in member's profile.
    4.4.7. Alternate Fitness Events:
        4.4.7.1. An alternate aerobic fitness test event is a 6-mile ruck march in lieu of the 2-mile
        run. The 6-mile ruck march will be conducted on flat level terrain with a 40-pound
        rucksack worn for the entire duration of the movement. Successful completion of the 6-
        mile ruck march with 40-pound ruck under the maximum time will be scored at 120
        points for the aerobic portion of the fitness test.
        4.4.7.2. Additionally, members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim test. The 800-
        meter swim test assesses the aerobic fitness and muscular endurance of the individual.
        Members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim in lieu of the 2-mile run. The
        standards for the alternate swim event are listed in Table 4.2. Satisfactory completion of
        the alternate swim event will be scored at 120 points.

 4.5. (Added-USAFE) Uniform Standards
    4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) As noted in AFI 36-2903 Dress and Personal Appearance of Air
    Force Personnel, SERE Specialists are authorized to wear the SERE arch on ABUs. In order
    to maintain uniform appearance, procure SERE arches from sources approved by the SERE
    Career Field Manager. Locally produced arches have historically failed to meet coloration
    and stitching consistency, leading to a non-uniform and unprofessional image.
        4.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Wear the SERE arch on the left sleeve, one-half inch below
        the shoulder seam, centered on the chevron and natural crease on the ABU. Wear on any
        other uniform is not approved.
    4.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Wear of non-standard SERE uniforms is approved for field duties;
    in-garrison wear is not approved. Specific items will be approved by OG/CC or designated
    representative in writing. These items are selected to improve ORM and facilitate
    training/exercise scenarios, such as enhancing appearance of hostile force during evasion
    scenarios. Examples on non-standard items are below.
44                                               AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


     4.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Uniforms worn while providing water survival training must
     allow instructors to act as lifeguards and/or first responders during operations. Wear of
     standard utility uniforms presents an additional hazard to instructors and students.
     Instructors will wear conservative clothing consisting of shorts and shirts with a uniform
     appearance. Use of wetsuits is also approved. WST uniforms will be worn during water
     operations, swimming and boating activities. These may be worn in transit or preparing
     for these activities, however not for wear outside the duty section.
     4.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Field uniforms consist of clothing provided via Battlefield
     Airmen Management System (BAMS). These ―multi-cam‖ uniforms are centrally issued
     and decrease wear and tear cost to SERE Specialists while enhancing field activities.
     Uniforms may be sanitized for specific training or exercise scenarios. When not
     performing role-play activities, SERE Specialists will wear name and rank at a minimum,
     wear of Velcro name patches is approved. Additional specialized clothing may be worn
     to augment field duties. Examples include gaiters, Gore-Tex clothing, mittens and
     mountain boots. Field uniforms may be worn in transit or preparing for field duties,
     providing no en-route stops occur at public areas. Regardless of uniform, maintain a
     professional image at all times.

                 SERE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND INSPECTION

5.1. Inspection: MAJCOMs will establish comprehensive certification and evaluation
programs to ensure compliance with this AFI and applicable MAJCOM instructions.
5.2. Compliance with the Air Force SERE Program: This will be assessed in three areas:
formal initial CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support programs. These three areas will be
evaluated during MAJCOM Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), MAJCOM specific
Inspector General inspections, MAJCOM Unit Compliance inspections (UCI), functional
inspections, or site visits.
   5.2.1. Initial SERE Training Programs.
      5.2.1.1. HQ AETC will report all results of ORI evaluations of courses S-V80-A, S-V84-
      A, S-V86-A, S-V87-A, S-V90-A, and MT-220, to HQ USAF/A3OS. These evaluations
      will be conducted at least biennially.
      5.2.1.2. AFSOC/IG will post results of AFSOC ORI evaluations on the AFSOC IG
      website. Evaluations of AFSOC SOF level-B Courses will be conducted in conjunction
      with AFSOC’s regularly scheduled ORI’s.
      5.2.1.3. HQ JPRA, in coordination with HQ USAF/A3OS, will conduct EAI inspections
      of level-B and -C CoCT courses in conjunction with Air Force inspection programs.
          5.2.1.3.1. MAJCOMs will notify HQ USAF/A3OS of pending inspections in which
          JPRA can be integrated for a concurrent EAI inspection.
          5.2.1.3.2. HQ USAF/A3OS will notify JPRA of the pending inspection and
          coordinate JPRA's involvement.
          5.2.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A3OS will obtain the results of evaluations from JPRA.
          5.2.1.3.4. HQ AFMC will report all results of ORI Inspections of USAFSAM Level-
          B Course to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.2. SERE CoCCT Programs.
   5.2.3. SERE MFMs will compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations involving SERE
   CoCCT programs and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.4. SERE Operational Support Programs. MAJCOM SERE functional managers will
   compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations of SERE Operational Support Programs
   and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS by 1 February.
5.3. SERE MFM Responsibilities:
   5.3.1. Coordinate SERE specialists augmentation for inspection teams to evaluate training
   and PR operational support programs.
   5.3.1. (USAFE) MAJCOM IG team associate inspector will be 1T0X1s in the rank of TSgt
   or above, coordinate with USAFE/A3TO for inspector sourcing.
 46                                                AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


   5.3.2. As a minimum, all CoCCT programs will be reviewed by a SERE specialist (1T071)
   at least biennially for safety processes and overall program effectiveness. This should be
   incorporated into the normal inspection programs when possible, although staff assistance
   visits are acceptable.
   5.3.2. (USAFE) Coordinate/conduct HQ Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) on Command SERE
   Programs as requested by unit commanders. Unit commanders can request a SAV through
   HQ USAFE/A3T, usafe.a3t@ramstein.af.mil.
   5.3.3. Ensure PR operational support missions are evaluated by qualified SERE SMEs
   during unit-level Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI)s or equivalent inspections.
   5.3.3. (USAFE) SERE Specialists assigned to manage, monitor and evaluate SERE CoCCT
   and operational support programs (USAFE IG team members, associate inspectors and HQ
   USAFE staff) must be equipped to ensure their safety and the safety of those they are
   evaluating in remote locations under austere conditions.
5.4. PR Exercises.
5.4. (USAFE) Readiness exercises that simulate mobilization of forces should also exercise
PR tasks. Assist in development of PR scenarios, implementation of PR Special Instructions,
pre-deployment preparation and integration into the exercise Concept of Operations. When
possible, augment the Exercise Evaluation Team to assess overall personnel recovery readiness.
Utilize checklists approved in coordination with SERE MFM and USAFE/IG.
   5.4.1. A robust PR exercise program is imperative for preparing the warfighter for
   prosecution of recovery across the spectrum of engagement. A major part of training for the
   PR process is the specific "actions on the objective" or the isolated personnel's role in the
   overall recovery effort. Currently, numerous MAJCOM-directed PR exercises are in place to
   allow recovery forces to execute critical METs of a successful recovery, as well as providing
   potential isolated personnel with an opportunity to practice evasion and recovery skills in a
   simulated combat environment (e.g., Red Flag, Air Mobility Warfare Center CADS, Cope
   Thunder, and ACC/AFSOC Combat Air Force (CAF) integration exercises). These exercises
   provide planners, aviation and ground recovery forces, as well as potential isolated personnel
   a forum for planning and executing full-spectrum PR TTP. Specifically, the SERE role
   within this process is to provide mission-critical feedback and after action review from the
   "survivor's" perspective.
   5.4.2. Specific SERE responsibilities.
       5.4.2.1. Assists in development of exercise plans (EXPLANs), SPINs, PR CONOPs, etc.
       5.4.2.2. Develops mission plans to include survivor participation, aircraft/team support,
       logistical support requirements, etc.
       5.4.2.3. Performs observer/controller (escort) duties to include data collection,
       performance feedback, safety, and emergency field medical treatment, as required.
       5.4.2.4. Coordinates and performs airborne operations, as required.
   5.4.3. Incorporating summary of PR exercise lessons learned and after action into both the
   formal and continuation processes is essential to successful PR. MAJCOMs conducting PR
   exercises will forward sanitized lessons learned and other PR-related after action items to HQ
AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                             47


  USAF/A3OS for review and distribution to the field. Use the "observation, analysis, and
  lessons learned" format for collecting and disseminating data.
  5.4.3. (USAFE) Forward PR SERE exercise lessons learned to USAFE SERE Functional
  Manager NLT 30 days after the exercise.
     5.4.3.1. HQ AETC/DOFA will ensure applicable data is incorporated into the formal
     training process.
     5.4.3.2. MFMs for commands with Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
     personnel and personnel assigned to combat-coded units will ensure appropriate lessons
     learned are distributed to subordinate units for inclusion in continuation/refresher training
     programs.

                      OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

A3.1. The SERE mission area often places personnel in remote environments and potentially
hazardous situations. Conditions often include austere operating locations, inclement weather,
rugged terrain, hazardous life forms, and fixed or rotary-wing operations. While operations
within the SERE mission area are typically objective driven, it is imperative all SERE missions
begin with a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment IAW the six step risk management
processes outlined in AFI 90-201 and AFPAM 90-202. While it is impractical to identify all
potential contingencies during an operation, proper planning will ensure overall individual safety
during high-risk training evolutions. Thorough risk management must assess the risk, weigh all
associated factors, and posture for as many contingencies as possible within a given operation
and ensure the appropriate level of command is involved in the decision making process to
accept residual risk. Regardless of the mission, thorough risk management must include
bioenvironmental, equipment, communication, location, and medical considerations.
   A3.1.1. Specifically, SERE operations and training activities should include the following:
       A3.1.1.1. Bioenvironmental
           A3.1.1.1.1. Weather
           A3.1.1.1.2. Terrain
           A3.1.1.1.3. Animal life
           A3.1.1.1.4. Plant life
           A3.1.1.1.5. Socio-political
   A3.1.2. Equipment
       A3.1.2.1. Vehicles
       A3.1.2.2. Personal protective
   A3.1.3. Communication
       A3.1.3.1. Mobile radios
       A3.1.3.2. Telephone
       A3.1.3.3. Air to ground visual signals
   A3.1.4. Assistance required date and time
       A3.1.4.1. Rear support element
   A3.1.5. Location
   A3.1.6. Medical
       A3.1.6.1. Minor
       A3.1.6.2. Major
       A3.1.6.3. Evacuation plans
AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012                                                              59


       A3.1.6.4. Location/directions/contact procedures for local emergency care facilities.
A3.2. Specifically, the SERE Program approach to ORM should include consideration of three
main areas involved with each factor; "what exists, what is the impact, and what is the plan" for
dealing with each particular factor. Incorporating these areas into unit-level ORM programs will
ensure overall standardization, reduce instability within the planning processes, and ultimately
ensure all SERE operations are prosecuted in a safe manner regardless of the operating
environment.
A3.3. The following ORM checklists/matrixes may be applied to SERE operations and training
activities in order to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission. However, it must be
understood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision-
making procedures: the more complex and potentially hazardous the operation, the more detailed
the mission planning. Additionally, units are encouraged to develop matrixes specifically
tailored to their individual operational requirements.
A3.4. Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in ―open water‖ or when
utilizing compressed air, pose a variety of unique risks that must be accounted for. MAJCOMs
will ensure units develop detailed operating instructions/plans of instruction (OIs/POIs) to ensure
overall objective accomplishment and risk management. Procedures must include location of
decompression chambers and chamber access procedures. The following outlines specific SERE
Specialist/support element requirements when conducting water survival training operations:
   A3.4.1. Certified lifeguard.
       A3.4.1.1. CPR qualified instructors or support personnel.
   A3.4.2. Units are encouraged to conduct training operations in an open water environment.
   Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows:
       A3.4.2.1. All participants will be equipped with adequate flotation.
       A3.4.2.2. Ensure adequate medical coverage is available.
   A3.4.3. Rotary-wing requirements.        In addition to environmental factors, medical
   considerations, recovery TTP, etc. training for rotary-wing crewmembers will also include
   ―hands-on‖ application of the Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) for assigned
   aircrews. Additionally, units are encouraged to utilize the Shallow Water Egress Trainer
   (SWET) as a method of reinforcing ―hard skill‖ requirements associated with underwater
   egress. When conducting hands on HEED and SWET operations, the OIs/POI will also
   include the following additional requirements:
       A3.4.3.1. SERE Specialists conducting HEED training require a thorough understanding
       of dive physiology. Personnel may receive this training either through basic civilian dive
       courses, military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation training.
       A3.4.3.2. To ensure aircrew safety, HEED and/or SWET training must be conducted in a
       controlled environment, i.e., swimming pool. Depth for personnel utilizing the HEED
       apparatus will not exceed 4 feet.
       A3.4.3.3. SWET. As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to clear
       the HEED bottle under water using both approved techniques (IAW US Navy HEED
       video) and breath successfully under water, maintain reference point, release, and
 60                                              AFI16-1301_USAFESUP_I 16 JULY 2012


       effectively egress the SWET. Participants will be required to demonstrate proficiency
       with the HEED bottle prior to entering the SWET.
A3.5. The matrixes identify basic concepts needed for consideration when conducting water
survival training. These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected
waters.

                              PR KIT/EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE

A4.1. Personnel Recovery Kits (PRK) or equipment, provide High-Risk-of-Capture (HRC)
personnel with essential equipment, tools and items necessary for successful evasion in specific
non-permissive environments. They are designed to supplement/augment AF Issued Survival
vest/kits, which are of a global nature. They should contain items that support the Combatant
Commander's PR plan by including items that aid in evasion and recovery events and enhance
the isolated person's ability to survive and evade. PRKs should be tailored to specific units and
missions when possible.
     A4.1.1. Coordinate unit's PRK requirements through the chain of command to respective
     SERE MFMs prior to acquisition. To ensure unity of effort, uniformity, life cycle, and
     supportability of kit items SERE MFMs will coordinate with theater recovery coordination
     centers (i.e., JSRC, RCC, Air Operations Center (AOC), etc.) to ensure interoperability and
     feasibility of PRK items into PR JTTP.
     A4.1.2. SERE SMEs are responsible for recommending items, containers, employment
     methods and conducting necessary PRK training events.
     A4.1.3. HRC personnel should employ PRKs during CST events and PR exercises and
     become familiar with the items. They must possess a thorough understanding of effective
     tactics, techniques and procedures for their employment, zeroization, destruction, and care
     and use while under field conditions.
     A4.1.4. Include PRK items as part of the individuals Evasion Plan of Action. In the event of
     a recovery effort, PRK information for missing personnel must be quickly passed by a secure
     means to the servicing recovery center.
     A4.1.5. PRKs should, as a minimum, contain Evasion Charts (EVC), small nighttime
     signaling devices, Blood Chit, and Pointee-Talkees of the Area of Operations.
     A4.1.6. Additional PRK items should address the specific needs required for successful
     evasion in a specified area of responsibility (AOR) and enhance the isolated person's ability
     to navigate, signal, hide, survive, and facilitate recovery. PRKs can include global
     positioning system (GPS) receivers, infrared lights, camouflage netting, insulated clothing,
     large capacity water containers etc. PRK contents are limited to mission, platform, egress
     procedures, and need.
     A4.1.7. The specific size and placement of the PRK on personnel should be closely
     scrutinized. If worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats, ensure the PRK does
     not impose a windblast hazard. Contact the local wing safety office and the group Life
     Support Officer if there is safety concerns for the PRK. If safety is in doubt, AFMC's Test
     Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB, CA, and the 311th Human Systems Wing,
     Brooks AFB, TX should evaluate PRKs for impact of emergency egress procedures.

          COCCT AUGMENTEE/ SUPPORT PERSONNEL TRAINING PLAN

A5.1. (Added) This attachment outlines the USAFE SERE training plan used to certify selected
personnel to teach CoCCT where a SERE Specialist does not exist or during the prolonged
absence of an assigned SERE Specialist. SERE Specialists will be the only persons authorized to
certify augmented/ support personnel. All personnel selected to teach SS-02 CST will be a
graduate of SV-80-A, Combat SERE Training. All personnel selected to teach SS-05 WST will
be a graduate of S-V90-A or S-V86-A. Non-SERE personnel will not instruct SS-03 Conduct
After Capture. Some form of Instructor training is highly encouraged (Life Support Instructor
course, Academic Instructor School, etc.).
   A5.1.1. (Added) Selected augmenter/ support personnel will be required to observe the
   CoCCT event they intend to teach at least twice before teaching the event under trainer
   supervision.
   A5.1.2. (Added) Selected augmenter/ support personnel will be required to teach 100% of a
   given event to a satisfactory level before they teach without trainer supervision, to include
   setup and teardown.
   A5.1.3. (Added) Selected augmenter/ support personnel will be required to complete this
   training cycle within 4 months of the start date. Each person certified will be re-evaluated on
   an annual basis by the assigned SERE Specialist to ensure proficiency and quality of
   instruction. Qualification in teaching a particular event does not alleviate need to accomplish
   the same event in support of currency requirements. Document training on an AF 1098 and
   keep in the individuals training records. Table A2.1 - A2.3 provide a recommended training
   flow, units may customize the training plan in accordance with unit needs. Personnel may be
   certified to teach an entire event, or for one lesson supporting a particular SS event.
