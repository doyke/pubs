                     in building 4750 (RAPCON)
         July        Airspace and Airfield Lighing Waivers
         October     Aircraft Parking Plan and TERPS

1.4. Operational Hours. The SJAFB airfield is open 7 days a week from 0700L - 2330L. The airfield,
Airfield Management and Tower will extend operating hours or remain open 24 hours a day, if needed, to
support National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO), higher
headquarters directed tasking, or extended base flying. The airfield will open a minimum of 1 hour prior
to the scheduled aircraft departure.

NOTE: When Airfield Management and/or the Control Tower are closed/un-manned, the airfield/RWY
is closed. Aircraft operations requested to a closed airfield/RWY are not authorized and a landing/takeoff
clearance cannot be issued. Aircraft that persist on landing or departing from a closed airport/RWY shall
be handled IAW FAAO 7110.65 guidance defining closed/unsafe RWY information (FAAO 7110.65,
CLOSED/UNSAFE RWY INFORMATION, Para 3-3-2.). ACC/A3 must approve temporary operations
when the airfield is closed.

1.5. Airfield Operations Outside of Published Hours. 4 OG/CC is the final approval authority for air-
field operations outside of published hours. 4 FW and tenant flying organizations planning for operations
between 2330L and 0700L shall coordinate after hours operations with 4 FW/Fighter Scheduling ( 4 OSS/
OSO) and the Airfield Operations Flight (4 OSS/OSA). For transient aircraft operations, the Airfield
Operations Flight will obtain approval from the 4 OG/CC. Wing, tenant and transient mission planners
should consider engine start time, delivery of clearance and/or taxiing as controlling factors, rather than
scheduled takeoff time. Control Tower and Airfield Management will open 1 hour prior to scheduled air-
craft departures. The following responsibilities apply:
NOTE: These procedures apply for supporting Higher Headquarters directed deployment and/or DoD
operations requiring airfield support outside of published operating hours.
     1.5.1. Requirements:
        1.5.1.1. 4 OG/CC approval
        1.5.1.2. 4 OSS/OSA coordination
        1.5.1.3. NOTAM issued for outside published hours
        1.5.1.4. An open airfield and a completed runway FOD check prior to operations

        ations Flight and/or Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) of 4 OG/CC approval/disap-
        proval. If necessary or when the airfield is closed, notify the standby personnel for RAPCON,
        Tower and AM Ops as soon as practical for any short notice unscheduled arrivals/departures.
        When ATC/AM Ops are open, notify them as soon as possible of any scheduled arrivals/depar-
        tures beyond airfield operating hours.
        1.5.2.2. Immediately notify the AOF/CC or designated representative of an inflight emergency
        (IFE) aircraft intending to land at SJAFB, and also provide ETA and status of the emergency air-
        craft.
     1.5.3. Fire Department will:
        1.5.3.1. Assume responsibility for operation of airfield lighting when Tower is closed utilizing the
        lighting vault.
        1.5.3.2. If Tower is open, ensure all vehicles coordinate for RWY access. If Tower is closed, Chief
        2 will assume control of the RWY and vehicle access.

     mise flight and ground safety.
     2.4.4. When appropriate, refer requests for deviation from established airfield obstruction clearance
     criteria to Base Civil Engineer.
     2.4.5. Ensure that contractor personnel accessing airfield areas requiring two-way radio contact with
     the Tower have radios prior to entering these areas and are thoroughly briefed on proper radio trans-
     mission procedures and phraseology during their flightline driving briefing.
     2.4.6. When it is necessary for maintenance personnel and equipment (other than normal daily traffic)
     to proceed in or near the RWY environment, coordinate such activities and advise Tower personnel so
     they can issue advisories to air traffic.
     2.4.7. Brief local procedures and restrictions to visiting evaluation and inspection team personnel that
     require access to the flightline.

2.5. Base Civil Engineer Responsibilities:
     2.5.1. The Base Civil Engineer will obtain waivers to airfield and airspace criteria IAW UFC
     3-260-01, including waivers temporary in nature resulting from construction on the airfield. No fixed
     obstacles will be erected on the airfield unless a waiver is accomplished.
     2.5.2. The Base Civil Engineer should coordinate with the Airfield Manager, Chief of Safety and Air-
     field Operations Flight Commander to ensure that a waiver has been obtained prior to authorizing the
     start of construction on the airfield. A waiver must be on file at Civil Engineering and Airfield Man-
     agement prior to construction start. 4 CES is the OPR for all waivers.

   2.7.2. The Crash Net does not require continuous monitoring. The Crash Net shall be immediately
   monitored upon activation of the Crash Phone for an inbound emergency or a ground emergency,
   when requested by the Fire Department, or as directed by the Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller on
   duty in the Tower.

2.8. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements:
   2.8.1. No aircraft will taxi in the movement area (runway, overruns, taxiways, aprons, and ramps)
   unless approved by Tower Ground Control (Seymour Ground).
      2.8.1.1. Aircraft may taxi from de-arm to park via TWY A to TWY F without prior approval from
      Ground Control.
      2.8.1.2. Aircraft must request counter-flow taxi from Ground Control prior to reaching TWY F
      when requesting to by-pass TWY F and taxi directly to the F-15E ramp against normal flow.
      “SEYMOUR GROUND, (ACID), REQUEST TAXI TO PARK COUNTER-FLOW TO (G/H/I/J)
      ROW.”
   2.8.2. Taxiing aircraft will yield to responding (lights flashing) emergency and alert vehicles.
   2.8.3. Tower will notify Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) of unauthorized taxiing aircraft.

2.9. Aircraft Towing Procedures:
   2.9.1. Aircraft towing operations will be in accordance with applicable technical manuals and Main-
   tenance Operating Instructions (MOIs).
   2.9.2. No aircraft will be towed onto the TWYs and/or the RWY unless prior coordination and
   approval from the Control Tower is obtained. The Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC)
   will pre-coordinate aircraft tows utilizing TWYs and/or the RWY by contacting the Control Tower
   and providing the tail number, parking location and destination of the aircraft to be towed. If the
   towed aircraft is to remain within the ramp area, Control Tower approval is not required. Contact the
   Control Tower via 2-way radio before commencing towing and at the conclusion of towing opera-
   tions. This is to preclude interference with the control of taxiing aircraft.
   2.9.3. No aircraft will be towed across the RWY unless escorted by transient maintenance or an AM
   Ops vehicle and Tower approval has been obtained prior to crossing. Excluded from this restriction is
   an aircraft under tow where two-way radio communications with the Tower are established and main-
   tained from the towed aircraft cockpit.
   2.9.4. Aircraft will not be towed at a speed of more than 5 miles per hour at any time.
   2.9.5. The MOCC will notify SFS prior to towing an aircraft within and/or across restricted area
   boundaries.

2.10. Aircraft Parking. The KC-135 Ramp, Transient Ramp (TA Ramp), F-15E Ramp, and Christmas
Tree area are the primary aircraft parking areas at SJAFB.
   2.10.1. The KC-135 ramp has four rows from east to west: A, B, C, and D. Alpha and Bravo rows
   belong to the 916 ARW; all other aircraft parking areas belong to the 4 FW.

2.24. Lightning within 5 NM Procedures:
   2.24.1. When lightning occurs within 5 NM (LW5) of SJAFB, airfield operations are suspended. Air
   Traffic Control will broadcast “LIGHTNING WITHIN 5 EXISTS AT SEYMOUR JOHNSON AIR
   FORCE BASE.” If cleared by the Supervisor of Flying (SOF), landings can be accomplished; how-
   ever, airfield personnel (e.g. maintenance, AM Ops, weapons and fuels personnel, etc.) will remain
   sheltered while a LW5 condition exists. Aircraft should neither fly approaches nor land during LW5
   unless cleared by SOF.

2.25. Airfield Maintenance, Construction and Closure:
   2.25.1. Any work on or near TWYs, RWYs or ramps shall be coordinated through the Airfield Man-
   ager or designated representative. Construction or installation work affecting the use of airfield facili-
   ties and/or environment shall not be made without prior coordination with Airfield Management or
   the Airfield Operations Flight (4 OSS/OSA).
   2.25.2. The Airfield Manager, or designated representative, will brief the work supervisor on hazards,
   clearance requirements and will coordinate as necessary with appropriate agencies to ensure the safe
   operation of construction, work and/or airfield maintenance operations.
   2.25.3. Responsibilities:
       2.25.3.1. Airfield Management:
           2.25.3.1.1. Participate in projects from planning phase through project completion.
           2.25.3.1.2. Ensure positive control of contractors working on the airfield.
       2.25.3.2. CE, Safety, Terminal Instrument Procedures Specialist (TERPS) Liaison and the Air-
       field Manager shall conduct joint inspections with emphasis on “waiver impact” of affected con-
       struction area(s) before and after completion of any major RWY, TWY, apron construction,
       exercise, or changes affecting existing aircraft parking/taxi and airfield procedures.
       2.25.3.3. 4th Civil Engineer Squadron shall:
           2.25.3.3.1. Ensure contracts for airfield construction contain safety and marking guidance
           found in Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 94-1, Standard Airfield Pavement Marking

            2.25.3.3.2. In conjunction with the Airfield Manager, hold meetings as needed during and
            prior to airfield projects. As a minimum, the following agencies shall be present: 4 FW and
            916 ARW Flight Safety, Airfield Management, and Construction Management.
        2.25.3.4. 4th Contracting Squadron shall:
            2.25.3.4.1. Ensure the statement of work for contracts in support of Airfield Operations con-
            tain language that the contractor shall be required to attend weekly meetings during and at
            least 1 month prior to airfield projects.
            2.25.3.4.2. Ensure contracts for airfield construction contain flightline driving requirements.
     2.25.4. Requests for airfield restrictions or closure shall be submitted through the Airfield Manager.

2.26. Closing/Suspending Runway Operations. The 4 FW/CC or 4 OG/CC may authorize airfield clo-
sures that do not exceed 5 days, including days already published closed, to support short-notice emer-
gency maintenance requirements, demonstration flights, or other short-term requirements to include goal/
training days and holidays. Closures scheduled for more than 5 days must be approved by HQ ACC/A3.
The airfield may close on a recurring basis up to 8 hours per month for airfield maintenance. The Airfield
Manager requests airfield restrictions or closures for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance/construc-
tion from the 4 OG/CC.
     2.26.1. The Airfield Manager has the authority to open/close RWY operations IAW AFI 13-213, Air-
     field Management. The Tower Watch Supervisor (WS)/Senior Controller (SC) have authority to sus-
     pend or resume operations to the RWY.
     2.26.2. The tower WS/SC will suspend RWY operations under for following conditions:
        2.26.2.1. An accident has occurred on or near the RWY would constitute a hazard.
        2.26.2.2. An aircraft has an emergency (i.e. in which debris or other hazardous material might be
        left on the RWY) or stops on the RWY. The tower will suspend RWY operations after an emer-
        gency landing.
        2.26.2.3. Any conditions exist that would constitute a hazard (e.g. FOD, bird condition, snow
        removal, arresting system maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction, pavement
        repair, etc.).
     2.26.3. AM Ops personnel will visually inspect the RWY after any of the conditions listed above and
     notify the tower when the RWY is safe to resume operations.
NOTE: The SOF may waive the airfield check following an emergency landing depending on the nature
of an emergency.

2.27. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. These areas are identified by Airfield
Management by NOTAM and appropriate airfield markings and signage IAW AF and FAA policies and
procedures.

2.28. Airfield Sweeper Operations. Sweeper operations on the airfield will be conducted IAW the Air-
field Sweeper OI. This instruction will be reviewed annually. Contact AM Ops at 722-4097 for a copy.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     23


2.29. Airfield Grass Mowing Operations. Grass mowing on the airfield will be conducted IAW Letter
of Agreement between 4 CES and 4 OSS/OSA. This LOA will be reviewed annually. Contact Airfield
Management at 722-4097 for a copy.

2.30. Maintenance Directed Quick Freeze Procedures. Quick Freeze procedures temporarily halt air-
craft ground movement on portions of the airfield after an object such as a tool or aircraft part is mis-
placed or lost causing a potential hazard to aircraft ground movements.
   2.30.1. If the missing part is from an aircraft, maintenance personnel will review the aircraft forms to
   determine if the missing part was previously documented. If not, a Quick Freeze will be directed by a
   Maintenance Superintendent (SUPER) and will be implemented/ coordinated through the Mainte-
   nance Operations Center (MOC). The following procedures will be followed when a Quick Freeze is
   directed:
       2.30.1.1. The SUPER will notify the MOC to initiate a Quick Freeze. If the location of the miss-
       ing item cannot be determined, all aircraft ground movement may be suspended until the exact
       location can be specified.
       2.30.1.2. The MOC will notify the SOF and Fighter Squadron Top 3s passing the taxiways/run-
       ways effected by the Quick Freeze and a description of the missing item.
       2.30.1.3. The SOF will inform the Tower Watch Supervisor.
       2.30.1.4. Tower will suspend ground movements on the effected areas, notify AM Ops that a
       Quick Freeze has been implemented and request AM Ops perform a visual inspection of the
       effected area. With the exception of the F-15E parking ramp, AM Ops will perform visual inspec-
       tions of the effected areas and when complete, will recommend to tower to resume aircraft move-
       ment in those areas. Maintenance retains the authority to resume operations on the F-15E ramp
       after a Quick Freeze is declared.
       2.30.1.5. The MOC will advise the SOF, Fighter Squadron Top 3s and AM Ops when the Quick
       Freeze is terminated.
   2.30.2. When a missing item is discovered by a crew chief or End-of-Runway (EOR) crew, mainte-
   nance procedures could result in a significant delay between the discovery of the missing part and
   when the Quick Freeze is declared as the aircraft forms are inspected. Operations Group personnel
   will follow the following procedures to minimize the potential of foreign object damage during this
   time:
       2.30.2.1. Aircrew will call the SOF to report a potential dropped object, pass the physical descrip-
       tion of the missing object and the taxi route including parking location.
       2.30.2.2. The SOF will pass the information to the Tower Watch Supervisor and direct termina-
       tion of all aircraft ground operations along the effected route. Aircraft along that route will hold
       their position unless back taxiing on the active runway. These aircraft will clear the runway and
       hold on the appropriate taxiway.
       2.30.2.3. Tower will coordinate with AM Ops as described in paragraph 2.30.1.4. AM Ops will
       inspect the effected areas and recommend resumption of ground operations up until the time main-
       tenance determines the missing part was already accounted for in the aircraft forms. If a Quick
       Freeze is subsequently declared, AM Ops will continue its visual inspection until all effected areas
       are inspected or the Quick Freeze is terminated.

                            CONTROL OF LOCAL AIRPORT TRAFFIC

3.1. Assigned Airspace and Local Flying Area:
     3.1.1. Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (GSB) Class D airspace has a radius of 6.5 statute miles (5.7
     NM), and extends from the airport surface up to 2500’ AGL (2,600’ MSL). Unless otherwise autho-
     rized, each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with Seymour Tower prior to enter-
     ing the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.
     3.1.2. The 4 FW’s local flying area is defined by a line extending from Cape Charles, VA VORTAC
     (N3720.90 W7559.99); direct to Gordonsville, VA VORTAC (N3800.81 W7809.19); direct to Elkins,
     WV VORTAC (N3854.90 W8006.00); direct to Charleston, WV VORTAC (N3820.98 W8146.20);
     direct to London, KY VORTAC (N3702.00 W8406.60); direct to Knoxville, TN VORTAC (N3554.30
     W8353.70); direct to Athens, GA VORTAC (N3356.90 W8319.50); direct to Charleston, SC
     VORTAC (N3252.70 W8002.30); then northeast along the coastline to the starting point.

3.2. Traffic Priorities:
   3.2.1. First Priority: Separation of National Airspace System traffic (military and civilian) and issuing
   safety alerts.
   3.2.2. System priorities: FAAO 7110.65 requires special priority handling of different operational
   flights. For example, emergencies, Presidential support, air defense missions, flight check, Air EVAC,
   NAOC, TACAMO, etc. requires special handling by the ATC system.
   3.2.3. Local priorities: FAAO 7110.65 defined priorities will take precedence over locally defined air-
   craft priorities. NAOC/TACAMO aircraft initiating an active alert launch will have priority over all
   local operations excluding emergency aircraft and other stipulations defined in the FAAO 7110.65.
   Local operations are given the following priority:
       3.2.3.1. Emergency aircraft
       3.2.3.2. NAOC/TACAMO
       3.2.3.3. Arrivals requiring special handling
       3.2.3.4. F-15E Demo Team local practices
       3.2.3.5. Full stop landings
       3.2.3.6. Departures
       3.2.3.7. FTU practice approaches
       3.2.3.8. Practice approaches (VFR & IFR)
   3.2.4. Priorities for practice approaches in the overhead pattern will be check rides, FTU student
   training, operational upgrade training, and continuation training. Aircraft without training require-
   ments will be expected to full stop when the pattern becomes busy. Aircraft will be directed to exit the
   VFR pattern or full stop by Tower or SOF if congestion becomes a problem.

3.3. TWY Restrictions and Information :

Table 3.1. TWY Restrictions
         TWY                  RESTRICTIONS
         A                    Closed to C-5 aircraft east of TWY G
         B                    None
         C                    None

     3.3.1. Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust Avoidance Procedures. While heavy aircraft are conducting taxi
     operations, Tower will provide safety advisories IAW FAAO 7110.65. Heavy aircraft landing RWY
     08 will be back-taxied to TWY G (unless aircraft is a KC-10 heavier than 523,000 lbs.) to exit the run-
     way due to the limited taxiway clearance between TWY J and H along TWY A. KC-10 aircraft
     heavier than 523,000 lbs. can expect to exit at TWY E when landing RWY 08. Heavy aircraft landing
     RWY 26 will normally exit at TWY B.

3.4. Military Operations Area (MOA):
     3.4.1. The FAA has designated the Echo Area as a Military Operations Area (MOA) to provide an
     area for military aircraft to conduct modified FCFs, formation training, proficiency checks, intercept
     training, air combat maneuvering, etc. Aerial refueling is not permitted within Echo MOA. All aircraft
     operating in the MOA shall have an operable transponder and squawk a code assigned by RAPCON.
     Echo MOA is shown in Figure 3.2.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                            27


Figure 3.2. ECHO MOA/ATCAA




  3.4.2. 4 FW Scheduling (4 OSS/OSO) is responsible for scheduling use of the Echo MOA by military
  aircraft. Published Echo MOA operational hours are Monday - Friday 0600L to 2000L.
     3.4.2.1. Utilization of the Echo MOA after published hours must be coordinated through 4 FW/
     Wing Scheduling, RAPCON to Washington Center. If approved, Washington Center will issue a
     NOTAM notifying surrounding Flight Service Stations.
     3.4.2.2. During published hours, SJAFB RAPCON may activate 7,000’ MSL – 10,000’ MSL for
     use; however, activation requires specific coordination with Washington Center. RAPCON cannot
     allow aircrews to use 7,000’ MSL to 10,000’ MSL outside of published operating hours without
     the entire Echo MOA being scheduled and a NOTAM published.
  3.4.3. Aircrew Responsibilities:
28                                                   SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


        3.4.3.1. Contact RAPCON Clearance Delivery for clearance to operate in the Echo MOA if on the
        ground. Echo MOA flights will be issued a clearance to the GSB 263/16. (Clearance Delivery will
        issue LC 4 to all aircraft planning to use the Echo MOA immediately after takeoff). If airborne,
        contact Seymour Johnson Approach on 290.9 (LC 4) or 273.6 (LC 5). MOA times should be
        pre-coordinated with 4 OSS/OSO.
        3.4.3.2. Monitor RAPCON assigned discrete frequency (263.15) while in the MOA. RAPCON
        does not monitor this frequency; however, the controller will use it to transmit any required ATC
        instructions while aircraft are in the MOA as well as provide VFR traffic advisory service on a
        workload-permitting basis.
        3.4.3.3. Lead aircraft will squawk assigned code with Mode C. Other aircraft in the flight will
        squawk the code subset with Mode C. (subset examples: 5101-57; 0301-57; 0360-77)
        3.4.3.4. Remain within the confines of the MOA and maintain VFR at all times.
        3.4.3.5. Use the Seymour Johnson altimeter setting.
        3.4.3.6. Only locally assigned fighter type aircraft will be allowed to share the Echo MOA, unless
        prior coordination has been accomplished. The flight lead that is scheduled for the MOA deter-
        mines acceptance of other flights in the MOA simultaneously. Echo MOA will remain exclusive
        use unless the flight lead/aircraft commander of the scheduled range time accepts concurrent use.
        Altitude separation may be used in lieu of area separation if all flights agree, i.e. 7,000 – 14,000
        and 15,000 – FL 220. A separate discrete frequency may be issued to the second flight by RAP-
        CON, depending on traffic load and frequency availability.
NOTE: Flights are under MARSA are responsible for their own separation within Echo MOA.
        3.4.3.7. 5 minutes prior to departing the MOA, advise RAPCON on the assigned approach fre-
        quency of the intent to depart and state desired recovery/flight plan option.
        3.4.3.8. Prior to step if unable to make your scheduled MOA time notify wing scheduling. If after
        step, notify Seymour Johnson RAPCON.
     3.4.4. Seymour Johnson RAPCON Responsibilities:
        3.4.4.1. Based on the flying schedule or upon request for the Echo MOA by an aircraft, RAPCON
        personnel shall coordinate with the appropriate ATC agencies to obtain use of the Echo MOA.
        3.4.4.2. RAPCON will issue the following phraseology to base assigned aircraft: “(Call Sign)
        ENTRY INTO ECHO MOA APPROVED, MAINTAIN VFR BLOCK (alt) THROUGH (alt),
        (restrictions if any). MONITOR (frequency).” Radar service is automatically terminated once
        base assigned aircraft are cleared within the confines of the Echo MOA.
        3.4.4.3. RAPCON personnel will use the phraseology in 3.4.4.2. when transient aircraft request
        the Echo MOA followed by “ADVISE RAPCON FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO RTB ON 290.9/
        273.6.” Transient aircraft shall be instructed “RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED” prior to fre-
        quency change to the MOA monitor frequency.
        3.4.4.4. Approval to enter the Echo MOA also includes approval to enter and exit ATC Assigned
        Airspace from FL180 to FL230 unless restricted (Center rarely approves above FL 220). RAP-
        CON will assign the upper altitude limit as received from Washington Center unless the Seymour
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                       29


       Johnson altimeter is below 29.92. When the local altimeter is below 29.92, RAPCON will assign
       a flight level 1,000’ below the Washington Center approved flight level.
       3.4.4.5. All aircraft shall be radar identified prior to exiting the confines of the Echo MOA IAW
       FAAO 7110.65 guidance.

3.5. Stereo Flight Plan Procedures. All aircraft contact RAPCON Clearance Delivery for stereo flight
plans. Aircraft are responsible to comply with the clearance in the stereo flight plan unless otherwise
specified by ATC.
NOTE: The following flight plans have specific departure procedures listed: BAT 2/6/8, ECHO 1,
GATOR 5/6/18/19, ROOTR 1/6/16, RADAR.

3.6. Non-Standard Formation Departures. Flight leads shall inform Tower at the time takeoff clear-
ance is requested of intended non-standard formation departure procedures. The flight lead shall include
whether the non-standard formation will join prior to exiting SJAFB airspace or continue to Washington
Center. The last aircraft of the non-standard formation shall squawk the subset of the flight lead’s assigned
transponder code with Mode C.

3.7. Quick/Unrestricted Climbs:
   3.7.1. 4 FW aircrews shall request quick or unrestricted climbs from Seymour Ground with initial taxi
   request. Example: “SEYMOUR GROUND, (ACID), TAXI WITH (ATIS) ON (FLIGHT PLAN),
   REQUEST QUICK (OR UNRESTRICTED) CLIMB TO (ALT).”
   3.7.2. Tower will instruct aircraft when quick/unrestricted climbs are approved and provide the initial
   assigned altitude. Aircraft authorized quick climbs will cross departure end of the RWY at or below
   1,000’ MSL. Unrestricted climbs do not have a departure end restriction and are authorized by excep-
   tion.
   Phraseology: “(ACID), QUICK CLIMB APPROVED, MAINTAIN (approved altitude).”
   3.7.3. Aircrew requests for quick/unrestricted climbs may be denied or initial requested altitudes may
   be adjusted based on traffic conditions, workload, and/or equipment limitations. Seymour RAPCON
   is the approval authority for quick or unrestricted climb requests.

3.8. Intersection Takeoffs. Pilots retain the prerogative to use the full RWY length or request a depar-
ture intersection other than that issued by the Tower. Tower shall include RWY length information when
issuing taxi instructions to transient aircraft for an intersection takeoff. Usable RWY lengths from inter-
sections will be issued to base assigned pilots at their request (see Figure 3.3.).

3.9. Local Climb Out Procedures:
     3.9.1. To ensure separation for aircraft in the overhead or night VFR pattern when the weather is
     VFR, RAPCON shall issue the following climb out instructions to aircraft making touch-and-go land-
     ings, stop-and-go landings, and low approaches from an instrument approach, whether they are enter-
     ing the Tower pattern or remaining with RAPCON:
        3.9.1.1. RADAR PATTERN: North/South Climb-out RWY 08 or 26- "CROSS DEPARTURE
        END OF RWY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND, TURN LEFT/RIGHT HEADING 350/180,
        CLIMB AND MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND."
        3.9.1.2. TOWER PATTERN: Tower Climb-out RWY 08 or 26- "CROSS DEPARTURE END OF
        RWY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND, MAINTAIN VFR, CONTACT TOWER" (aircraft
        that are entering the tower pattern).
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                       31


NOTE: These climb out instructions may be issued to all base aircraft by stating "EXECUTE LOCAL
CLIMB OUT NORTH/SOUTH/TOWER." However, they shall be issued to all transient aircraft as stated
in paragraph 3.9.1.1. or 3.9.1.2. above.
   3.9.2. Any time there is an aircraft in the overhead pattern, Tower shall ensure separation by issuing
   the following climb out instructions to all transient IFR departures, all VFR departures, and all aircraft
   entering the Tower pattern from takeoff: "CROSS DEPARTURE END OF RWY AT OR BELOW
   ONE THOUSAND."
NOTE: All SJAFB assigned aircraft shall automatically cross the departure end of RWY at or below
1,000’ MSL to protect the overhead pattern, unless approved for an unrestricted climb.

3.10. Approach and Landing Pattern:
   3.10.1. Preferred Recovery Policy: The overhead pattern is the preferred recovery for day-to-day fly-
   ing operations. During inflight emergencies, the aircrew will determine the most appropriate recovery
   procedure. If recovering IFR to the VFR pattern, expect vectors to 10 NM initial or a 5 NM VFR
   straight-in. IFR separation will be maintained until 3-5 NM initial unless the aircraft cancels IFR.
   Remain on approach frequency until advised to contact Tower.
   3.10.2. VFR Recoveries: Basic radar advisory services are automatically provided for VFR recover-
   ies. Aircraft shall contact RAPCON prior to 35 NM from the field and state the ATIS code and inten-
   tions (vectors to initial/tactical initial, VFR straight-in, etc.). Traffic sequencing and deconfliction
   vectors issued by the RAPCON will be followed unless safety of flight is a factor. Pattern entries via
   Mt Olive and La Grange may be approved unless tower or radar pattern sequencing prevents it. If traf-
   fic conditions warrant, VFR flights may be instructed to proceed direct to a specified mileage for
   extended initial or straight-in entry. EXAMPLE: “PROCEED DIRECT ONE ZERO MILE INITIAL,
   CONTACT TOWER.”

Figure 3.4. VFR TRAFFIC PATTERN




     3.10.2.1. VFR Traffic Patterns (see Figure 3.4.):
        3.10.2.1.1. Overhead Pattern: Flown by fighter aircraft at 1,800’ MSL. Weather minimums
        are 3000/3. Break is over the approach end unless otherwise instructed by Tower.
        3.10.2.1.2. Rectangular Pattern: Flown by cargo type aircraft at 1,300’ MSL. Weather mini-
        mums are 2000/3.
        3.10.2.1.3. The Tower Watch Supervisor has the final authority to open/close the Tower VFR
        traffic patterns based on weather conditions, operational need, traffic conditions, or workload
        limitations. The SOF may direct full stop landings at any time.
     3.10.2.2. IMC En Route to the Reporting Point: If aircraft are required to penetrate a cloud deck
     or any IMC en route to the VFR pattern, then aircrew will contact the appropriate ATC facility for
     IFR descent clearance to VMC. If aircrews are not in VMC with the field by 3,000’ MSL or 10
     NM, then aircrews shall advise RAPCON and request an instrument or radar approach.
     3.10.2.3. Breakouts: If a conflict between aircraft on extended initial and aircraft on a 45 degree
     turn to initial occurs, the aircraft on extended initial has the right-of-way. Aircraft on 45 degrees to
     initial will execute a climbing turn towards the inside of the pattern to 2,500’ MSL, proceed either
     to LaGrange (RWY 26) or Mount Olive (RWY 08), and re-enter the pattern. Upon breaking out to
     the inside of the pattern, aircrews should be vigilant for additional VFR traffic in the vicinity of
     LaGrange or Mt Olive.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                       33


       3.10.2.4. LaGrange or Mt Olive Re-entry: Climb to 2,500’ MSL after the departure end of the
       RWY and proceed south of the field to the re-entry point as described below—report reaching the
       re-entry point. All aircraft re-entering over LaGrange or Mt Olive shall be considered requesting
       initial unless a straight-in approach is specifically requested prior to reaching the La Grange or Mt
       Olive reporting points. Requesting a straight-in approach prior to reaching the reporting points
       will allow for proactive sequencing by air traffic control (see para 3.10.2.5.). Maintain 2,500’
       MSL until 3-5 NM initial. Report reaching initial (see Figure 3.4.).
           3.10.2.4.1. RWY 08: Head approximately 200 degrees until the GSB 154/5.3 (where Hwy 111
           crosses the East/West portion of the Neuse River), then right to heading of 260 degrees for Mt
           Olive.
           3.10.2.4.2. RWY 26: Head approximately 120 degrees until the GSB 154/5.3, then turn left to
           a heading of 080 degrees for LaGrange.
       3.10.2.5. VFR straight-ins from Mt Olive or LaGrange:
           3.10.2.5.1. Aircraft will request re-entry for a VFR straight in when on-the-go. Tower may not
           be able to approve a straight in based on traffic conditions.
           3.10.2.5.2. Fly the normal VFR pattern ground track for re-entry. Report reaching the re-entry
           point.
           3.10.2.5.3. When cleared by Tower, descend to 1,300’ MSL and configure.
           3.10.2.5.4. Visually clear the final approach corridor for traffic and proceed to a 5 NM final at
           1,300’ MSL.
       3.10.2.6. Short Initial: Climb to 1,800’ MSL after the departure end of the RWY and proceed
       south of the field. Remain within 5 NM of the field. Enter a 3 NM initial, or as directed by the
       Tower.
       3.10.2.7. Closed Maneuvers: Aircraft conducting practice approaches in the VFR traffic pattern
       shall, as soon as possible after completion of low approach or touch and go, advise the control
       tower of intentions. After receiving approval from the Tower, closed maneuvers will be initiated at
       the departure end of the RWY.
NOTE: Due to pilot training requirements and that climb out is a critical phase of flight, the tower will
seek to limit control instructions to aircraft on the go and await the aircrew’s request. However, the tower
will issue control instructions to aircraft on the go when safety of flight or traffic volume dictates.
           3.10.2.7.1. Should circumstances warrant (i.e. fuel, pattern spacing), a closed pattern initiated
           from other than the departure end of the RWY may be requested by the pilot. Upon clearance
           or request from Tower for midfield, present position, pilot’s discretion, etc. closed traffic, the
           closed pull-up may be initiated no earlier than midfield.
           3.10.2.7.2. Fly downwind at 1,800’ MSL.
NOTE: KC-135 requesting closed pattern will fly downwind at 1,300’ MSL (see Figure 3.8.)
       3.10.2.8. 4 FW Night VFR Pattern (see Figure 3.5. and Figure 3.6.):
           3.10.2.8.1. Required weather is 3000/5. Pattern will be entered from an instrument approach
           or initial takeoff. RWY PAPI lights and the Tower DBRITE must be operational . A maximum
34                                                SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


         of 3 aircraft will be allowed in the pattern at any time. Night VFR pattern is to only be flown
         by FTU squadrons for syllabus training.
         3.10.2.8.2. Radio calls: After go around from approach, contact Tower (Ch 3) and request
         “(ACID), ON THE GO, REQUEST NIGHT VFR PATTERN, LOW APPROACH/TOUCH
         AND GO/FULL STOP.” If desiring to go to the RADAR pattern, add “TO RADAR” to your
         request.
         3.10.2.8.3. Tower shall coordinate with RAPCON prior to releasing aircraft to the radar pat-
         tern.
         3.10.2.8.4. Pattern adjustments are limited to an extended upwind and/or downwind.
      3.10.2.9. Simulated Flameout patterns (SFO): SFO PATTERNS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED
      AT SJAFB.

            will be allowed in the pattern at any time. The pattern will only be used from sunrise to sunset.
            RVFR will not be utilized if the BWC at SJAFB is moderate or greater. The Tower’s DBRITE
            must be operational. The Tower Watch Supervisor has approval authority for 4 FW use of the
            Restricted VFR pattern.
            3.10.2.10.2. After go around from approach contact tower, “(Call sign), ON THE GO
            REQUEST CLOSED, (state intentions)”. Pull closed at departure end. Fly the required pattern
            (normal or no flap as required for training).
            3.10.2.10.3. Traffic priority will be as outlined in SJAFBI 11-250 3.2. and limited to FTU syl-
            labus training and instrument check rides.
            3.10.2.10.4. Pattern adjustments are limited to upwind extension, re-entry to short initial, and
            holding at 1,800’ MSL following the overhead pattern ground track.
            3.10.2.10.5. Re-entries to Mt Olive or LaGrange are not authorized.
            3.10.2.10.6. Breakouts will be as follows:
                3.10.2.10.6.1. Aircraft on downwind will be directed by tower to break out and report
                short initial. Aircraft will then proceed to short initial IAW the inflight guide procedures,
                turn/call “SHORT INITIAL (state intentions: i.e., touch and go/full stop/etc.).”
                3.10.2.10.6.2. Aircraft on short initial directed back to radar by tower, “(ACID) CARRY
                STRAIGHT THROUGH INITIAL, EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT NORTH,
                SQUAWK (code), MAINTAIN VFR AND CONTACT ARRIVAL LOCAL CHANNEL
                13.” Aircraft will then execute North Climb-out at the departure end and contact Arrival,
                “ARRIVAL, (ACID), NORTH CLIMBOUT, REQUEST IFR PICKUP.” Aircraft will be
                given a squawk and cleared to SJAFB via radar vectors.
                3.10.2.10.6.3. In addition, tower may instruct aircraft on the go to exit the restricted VFR
                pattern, “(ACID) FLY RWY HEADING MAINTAIN VFR SQUAWK (code), CONTACT
                ARRIVAL LOCAL CHANNEL 13.” Aircraft will then execute climb-out as directed and
                contact arrival. “ARRIVAL, (ACID), RWY HEADING, REQUEST IFR PICKUP.”
            3.10.2.10.7. Cut-off for aircraft conducting a straight-in with aircraft in the RVFR pattern:
            F-15E aircraft in the RVFR pattern that has not initiated a base turn prior to an aircraft on a
            straight-in reaching 5-mile final will be issued a left turn (RWY 26 in use) or right turn (RWY
            08 in use) to follow the overhead pattern ground track at 1,800’ MSL.
     3.10.3. IFR Recoveries: When the overhead pattern is closed, a radar trail instrument approach is the
     preferred recovery. Initial contact with RAPCON will include the current ATIS code, type of recovery
     desired (i.e. TACAN approach, etc.) and type of landing. Split-ups of 4-ship flights, if desired, should
     be accomplished with Washington Center using “split recovery” flight plans.
        3.10.3.1. Radar Final Control (RFC) Service: Seymour Johnson RAPCON is normally staffed to
        provide single RFC service (PAR approaches, Air Surveillance Approaches (ASR), ILS, and
        TACAN radar monitoring/flight following, etc.) from 0800L to 2000L Monday - Friday, with the
        exception of down days and holidays. The RAPCON will also be staffed to provide single RFC
        coverage after 2000L to support 4 FW flying. When traffic conditions dictate and additional staff-
        ing is available, the Watch Supervisor may elect to open the second RFC position.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     37


          3.10.3.1.1. Radar Monitoring/Flight Following: ILS approaches will be radar monitored, and
          TACAN approaches will be flight followed, only when the weather is IFR, at night or upon
          pilot request IAW FAAO 7110.65. In the event of the PAR being out of service, both ILS and
          TACAN approaches will be flight followed by an RFC qualified controller utilizing the Air-
          port Surveillance Radar (ASR). During daytime and VFR conditions, aircraft will be trans-
          ferred to the Tower at 10 miles from the end of the RWY unless otherwise coordinated or the
          pilot specifically requests radar monitoring.
          3.10.3.1.2. RFC Limitations: RFC Controllers shall not control more than one PAR/ASR
          approach or monitor more than four aircraft on instrument approach at the same time. Further-
          more, aircraft are NOT permitted to conduct PAR/ASR approaches in radar-trail formation.
          Aircraft requesting PAR/ASR approaches may incur delays due to additional arriving aircraft.
          4 FW and tenant unit aircraft will, to the maximum extent possible, support controller requests
          for radar approaches to aid controller training and proficiency.
              3.10.3.1.2.1. PAR missed approach instructions are “FLY RWY HEADING, CLIMB
              AND MAINTAIN 1,900’.” These instructions will be issued to non-base assigned aircraft
              before the aircraft begins final descent for a full stop landing when weather reports indi-
              cate that any portion on the final approach will be conducted in IFR conditions.
              3.10.3.1.2.2. Controllers will issue lost communications instructions to military pilots on
              request, and to civilian pilots when required by FAAO 7110.65 using the following
              phraseology: “IF NO TRANSMISSIONS ARE RECEIVED FOR ONE MINUTE IN THE
              PATTERN OR FIVE SECONDS ON FINAL, ATTEMPT CONTACT ON (frequency)
              AND PROCEED VFR. IF UNABLE, PROCEED WITH (TACAN/ILS) RWY (26/08)
              APPROACH, MAINTAIN 3,200’ UNTIL ESTABLISHED ON APPROACH PROCE-
              DURE.”
       3.10.3.2. Climb-out: Aircraft executing multiple practice approaches will be issued climb out
       IAW Para 3.9. on the first approach. Controllers will issue climb out for succeeding approaches on
       pilot request.
       3.10.3.3. Radar Trail Recovery Procedures: The following procedures are applicable to radar trail
       recoveries flown at SJAFB only IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3 and AFI 11-2F-15EV3 SJAFB Supple-
       ment 1.
          3.10.3.3.1. Radar trail recovery is limited to a maximum of four aircraft. The last aircraft will
          squawk the beacon code subset of the lead aircraft.
          3.10.3.3.2. Required spacing between each aircraft is 9,000 - 12,000 feet. Intermediate aircraft
          will maintain altitudes between the lead and trail aircraft. Spacing between flights is IAW AFI
          11-2F-15EV3 and AFI 11-2F-15EV3 SJAFB Supplement 1.
          3.10.3.3.3. Recovery profiles are available in AFI 11-2F-15EV3 and AFI 11-2F-15EV3
          SJAFB Supplement 1.
          3.10.3.3.4. Radar vectors: If spacing was not established prior to the en route descent, flight
          leads should direct drag maneuvers for each flight member in sufficient time to ensure
          required spacing is obtained prior to turning final.
NOTE: ATC must be advised prior to commencing radar trail (drag) or any non-standard formation.
38                                                  SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


          3.10.3.3.5. Reverse formation recovery: If the lead call sign aircraft is recovering in trail of
          the flight, the lead call sign aircraft will continue to squawk the ATC assigned beacon code and
          inform the RAPCON of the reverse formation. The first aircraft of the reverse radar trail for-
          mation will squawk an assigned ATC discrete beacon code with Mode C (subset beacon codes
          shall not be used in reverse formation recoveries to ensure positive identification of both air-
          craft and prevent potential confusion). Phraseology: “(call sign lead) REMAIN ON PRESENT
          SQUAWK AND HAVE FRONT AIRCRAFT SQUAWK (code) WITH ALTITUDE.”
          3.10.3.3.6. Climb-out: Radar trail recoveries will normally be planned and flown as a low
          approach to Tower or a full stop. Due to radar separation requirements, a maximum of two air-
          craft can execute a low approach to radar in succession. A flight cannot maintain radar trail
          formation following a low approach/touch and go and return to the radar pattern. Therefore,
          flight leads should inform RAPCON on initial contact if more than two elements require low
          approaches to radar. Multiple practice radar in-trail approaches shall be conducted only in
          VMC. During practice approaches in VMC conditions, after an executed low approach/land-
          ing, the flight is responsible for their own separation until standard separation has been
          attained. RAPCON will issue flight split-up instructions as necessary. The first aircraft will
          normally be assigned standard climb out instructions, and the second aircraft will be assigned
          a course divergent by 30 degrees to re-enter the radar pattern. Both aircraft will be individually
          radar identified after completing the low approach.
          3.10.3.3.7. Radar trail missed approach: Each aircraft will maintain 2 NM radar trail when
          executing the published missed approach procedure, unless individual climb out instructions
          are requested. Each aircraft is responsible for maintaining its own separation until ATC estab-
          lishes radar contact and provides the required spacing for separate clearances through radar
          vectors. If the VFR pattern is open, and VMC can be maintained, aircraft will contact Tower
          and enter the overhead pattern.
          3.10.3.3.8. Lost Communication: Follow aircrew procedures IAW FLIP Flight Information
          Handbook.
       3.10.3.4. Go-Around Procedures:
          3.10.3.4.1. Radar Controlled Go-Around Procedures:
              3.10.3.4.1.1. If Tower initiates a breakout or fails to issue a clearance RAPCON shall
              state: “(ACID), TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELED/NOT RECEIVED, CLIMB AND
              MAINTAIN 1,900’, TURN LEFT (RWY 08)/RIGHT (RWY 26) HEADING 350, (reason
              if known), ACKNOWLEDGE.”
NOTE: Whenever RWY 08 is in use, close coordination with the Arrival controller is needed due to the
proximity of an antenna northwest of SJAFB.
              3.10.3.4.1.2. If Tower directs an aircraft to discontinue an approach, but desires the air-
              craft to go straight ahead, Tower will activate the red light and state, “GO AROUND,
              STRAIGHT AHEAD." RAPCON will issue the following: “(ACID) TOWER CLEAR-
              ANCE CANCELED/NOT RECEIVED, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 1,000’ UNTIL
              DEPARTURE END OF RWY, THEN CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 1,900’, FLY HEAD-
              ING 260/080, (reason if known), ACKNOWLEDGE”.
NOTE: When the airfield is IFR, the 1000’ restriction may be deleted.

           3.10.3.4.2. Tower Controlled Go-Around Procedures (radar flight following not provided):
               3.10.3.4.2.1. Tower will initially issue, “FLY RWY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAIN-
               TAIN 1,900’.” Tower shall issue additional instructions if needed to protect the overhead
               pattern, and shall immediately coordinate with RAPCON for additional breakout instruc-
               tions (i.e. a heading to the north and altitude).
               3.10.3.4.2.2. When two aircraft are broken out simultaneously Tower shall immediately
               coordinate with Arrival for additional control instructions to ensure divergence between
               both aircraft and other aircraft under Arrival’s control.
           3.10.3.4.3. When two aircraft are broken out simultaneously RAPCON shall issue the second
           aircraft a diverging heading of at least 30 degrees to ensure separation (Example: RWY 08 in
           use, issue the second aircraft heading 020 degrees. RWY 26 in use, issue the second aircraft
           heading 320 degrees).
       3.10.3.5. Radar Pattern: The radar pattern is flown either north or south of the RWY at 3,000’
       MSL (see Figure 3.7.).

3.11. Light Aircraft in the Traffic Pattern. The light aircraft traffic pattern altitude is 1,000’ MSL. The
pattern is flown north of the airfield; left turns for RWY 08 and right turns for RWY 26. Aircraft shall
avoid flying over the base housing area, alert area and munitions storage area unless directed by ATC.

3.12. Helicopter Operations. Helicopter operations will be conducted IAW FAAO 7110.65. Helicopters
normally enter Class D airspace from the north or the south unless otherwise directed by ATC. Recom-
mended altitude is 600’ MSL.

3.13. Civil Aircraft. Civilian aircraft may be authorized to make practice approaches during periods of
light flying provided it does not unduly delay any military aircraft. Only low approaches will be allowed
unless prior permission is obtained from Airfield Management. During real-world FPCON C and D con-
ditions, civilian aircraft will not enter GSB Class D airspace. Exceptions to this policy are law enforce-
ment, Lifeguard and emergency aircraft.

3.14. KC-135 Visual Pattern/Circling Procedures:
     3.14.1. The KC-135 visual traffic pattern shall be flown at 1,300’ MSL IAW the following instruc-
     tions unless otherwise instructed by ATC (see Figure 3.8.).
        3.14.1.1. Start crosswind turn within 1 mile of departure end.
        3.14.1.2. Turn downwind inside the lumber yard and fly a 078 track (should pass abeam TACAN
        within 2.0 DME).
        3.14.1.3. Turn base abeam end of RWY (pattern should give enough room to roll out slightly to
        check final prior to turning base to final).
     3.14.2. In addition to the pattern ground track, practice-circling approaches will remain within 3 NM
     of the field.

Figure 3.9. REDUCED SAME RWY SEPARATION
(see NOTES 1-4)




NOTES:
     1. Similar aircraft means the same airframe, i.e., F-15C to F-15E.
        2. Dissimilar fighter aircraft means any mix of different airframes, i.e., F-15E to F-16.
        3. All aircraft must maintain 500’ lateral or vertical separation when overflying aircraft on the
           RWY. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
        4. RSRS is only applicable to Air Combat Command aircraft.
     3.15.2. RSRS of 8,000’ is authorized for day/VFR/dry RWY for locally assigned KC-135s executing
     full stop landings behind locally assigned F-15Es executing a full stop/touch and go/low approach
     (see Figure 3.9.).
     3.15.3. EXCEPTIONS: RSRS is not applicable under the following conditions:
        3.15.3.1. Emergency aircraft.
        3.15.3.2. Aircraft cleared for the option.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                       43


       3.15.3.3. When the RCR is less than 12 or braking action less than fair (determined by Airfield
       Management).
       3.15.3.4. When any aircrew or controller determines that safety of flight may be jeopardized.
       3.15.3.5. Between KC-135 and other aircraft, except as stated in Para 3.15.2. and Figure 3.9.
   3.15.4. Stop and go landings are not authorized at SJAFB for 4 FW F-15E aircraft.

3.16. RWY Selection Procedures:
   3.16.1. SJAFB Control Tower will determine the RWY in use IAW the provisions of FAAO 7110.65
   when the information received from dual wind sensors does not conflict. Normally, RWY 26 will be
   used when the wind speed is less than 5 knots as the calm wind runway. Runway 26 is also the pri-
   mary instrument runway for Seymour Johnson.
   3.16.2. When conflicting information is received from the dual wind sensors, the Tower will confer
   with Weather and the SOF to determine which RWY is operationally advantageous.
   3.16.3. The Control Tower will coordinate with RAPCON prior to commencing a RWY change. In
   addition, Tower will notify the following agencies: Airfield Management, Weather, Barrier Mainte-
   nance, and Fire Department (for arresting system changes).
   3.16.4. Barrier Maintenance will notify AM Ops and Tower when the barrier change is complete. AM
   Ops, in turn, will notify CP and MOCC.

3.17. Opposite Direction Traffic:
   3.17.1. During times of light traffic pattern activity, when operationally required, or when it results in
   the most expeditious flow of traffic, opposite direction arrivals/departures may be approved. All ver-
   bal coordination will include the phraseology “OPPOSITE DIRECTION ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE,
   RWY 08/26”.
   3.17.2. Opposite direction departures should state their request upon initial radio contact with Ground
   Control.
   3.17.3. Separation minimums: An arriving aircraft will not proceed closer than 10 nm from the land-
   ing threshold until a departure from/low approach to the opposite RWY has crossed the departure end,
   and is established on a course diverging by at least 45 degrees from the reciprocal of the final
   approach course. An arriving aircraft will not proceed closer than 10 nm from the landing threshold
   until an arrival to the opposite RWY has crossed the landing threshold of that RWY.

3.18. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Procedures:
   3.18.1. The SOF is a direct representative of the 4 OG/CC and is the focal point for command and
   control of 4 FW flight operations. The SOF program is managed by the SOF Program Manager
   assigned to the 4 OG/OGV. Policies and procedures concerning SOF related issues should be
   addressed through the SOF Program Manager. Detailed SOF procedures are outlined in AFI 11-418
   and supplemented through AFI 11-418, SJAFB Supplement 1.
   3.18.2. Unless safety of flight dictates, the SOF will discuss operational issues only with the Tower
   Watch Supervisor. The SOF may make recommendations/suggestions to ATC based on unique
   requirements of individual missions or knowledge of the flying schedule.
44                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


     3.18.3. The SOF may broadcast on ATC frequencies only after prior coordination and approval from
     ATC IAW AFI 13-203. The SOF is not authorized to issue ATC instructions, but may transmit mes-
     sages pertaining to safety of aircraft operation or the preserving of life or property.

3.19. Flyover Aircrew Procedures:
     3.19.1. Wing Scheduling designates a squadron to perform a flyover when required. The FS/DO will
     designate the specific flight to perform the fly over as part of its departure to or RTB from the working
     areas.
     3.19.2. Retreat ceremony procedures are IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3 SJAFB Supplement 1.
     Flight leads will plan on flying over the flagpole (N3521.49/W7757.75) at exactly 1630:30L. The
     music for retreat will begin at 1630L and the F-15Es are to fly over during the music. Coordinate with
     the SOF on taxi out to confirm a flyover will take place. Minimum weather is 2500/5. Fly an extended
     initial to the active RWY and at 5-10NM out bear slightly to the north to fly over the flagpole.
     Approaching the field boundary, descend to 1,100’ MSL/300 KIAS in close formation. After the fly-
     over approaching the far field boundary, climb out for a reentry or a recovery coordinated with Sey-
     mour Approach. Aircrew must exercise caution for other civil/military VFR traffic and towers NW of
     Goldsboro.
     3.19.3. All changes and cancellations regarding flyovers should be passed to the SOF by phone or to
     the Lion SOF FM Net 1.

3.20. Overflights Initiating Ground Training Exercises :
     3.20.1. Procedures:
        3.20.1.1. Ramp overflights initiating ground training exercises at SJAFB may only be requested
        by higher headquarters or the 4 FW/CC. Pilots participating in the ramp overflight will coordinate
        with the SOF and RAPCON. For more information regarding ramp overflights, refer to AFI
        11-206.
        3.20.1.2. Minimum weather at time of ramp overflight will be 1500/3. Ramp overflights are lim-
        ited to a maximum of two aircraft making one pass each. Re-attacks are not authorized. Evasive/
        Defensive maneuvering is not authorized.
        3.20.1.3. Aircraft will arrive and depart IFR.
        3.20.1.4. RAPCON will vector aircraft to initial after coordinating with Tower. Tower will ensure
        Class D airspace is sterilized prior to aircraft reaching 5 NM. Maintain 300 KIAS or below, and
        altitude assigned by RAPCON (traffic pattern altitude is 1,800’ MSL). Prior to handoff to Tower,
        RAPCON will issue departure instructions. Ramp overflight will be made on the Tower frequency.
        Tower will issue clearance for the ramp overflight.
        3.20.1.5. All ramp overflights will be directed against the RWY. Aircraft will remain under VFR
        at all times. Avoid overflying the NAOC alert area, the munitions area on the west end of the air-
        field, and the KC-135 ramp on the east end of the field. Aircraft shall not fly north of the F-15E
        ramp. Use caution for Control Tower located approximately 1,000 feet east of transient ramp at
        215’ MSL.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     45


      3.20.1.6. Commence overflight approaching the airfield boundary with Tower clearance. Mini-
      mum altitude over populated areas is 1,000’ AGL (1,100’ MSL). Aircraft will not exceed 350
      KIAS. Do not descend below 500’ AGL (600’ MSL) over the RWY or transient ramp. If Tower
      clearance is not received, aircraft will carry straight through initial and comply with RAPCON
      instructions.
      3.20.1.7. Upon completion of overflight, remain at/below 1,000’ MSL until past RWY departure
      end. When departing to the east, cross Highway 70 (approximately 1 NM east of RWY departure
      end) above 1,000’ MSL. Comply with previously issued ATC instructions and contact departure
      control on assigned frequency.
   3.20.2. Responsibilities:
      3.20.2.1. RAPCON and/or SOF will advise Tower of planned ramp overflights (time, type aircraft
      and call sign). RAPCON will advise aircrew of current weather and any restrictions affecting the
      overflight. RAPCON will issue departure instructions and hand the aircraft to Tower when it has
      the field in sight.
      3.20.2.2. SOF and Tower personnel will visually monitor overflight to assure flight safety and
      compliance with this directive. If conflict occurs during airfield attack, Tower will terminate using
      phraseology, “(ACID), SEYMOUR TOWER, KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT
      OFF.”

3.21. Aerial Demonstration Procedures. (IAW 4 FW, SJ RAPCON, SJ Control Tower, and Wash-
ington Center LOA)
   3.21.1. SJAFB Airport aerobatic area airspace is a 5 NM radius of SJAFB’s RWY (35°20’31.75”N),
   (77°56’53.44”W) from the surface to 15,000’ MSL (see Figure 3.10.).

Figure 3.10. AERIAL DEMONSTRATION PRACTICE AIRSPACE




     3.21.2. Procedures:
        3.21.2.1. Seymour Johnson Control Tower is the primary ATC control facility when the aerobatic
        area is activated.
            3.21.2.1.1. Only one aircraft will operate in the aerobatic area at a time.
            3.21.2.1.2. All aircraft operating within the aerobatic area shall maintain VFR at all times and
            shall be responsible for seeing and avoiding all conflicting traffic.
            3.21.2.1.3. Entry into, operations within, and exit from the aerobatic area requires ATC
            approval.
            3.21.2.1.4. All aircraft operating in the aerobatic area shall monitor Seymour Johnson Control
            Tower Local Control and Guard frequencies on a continuous basis while operating within the
            aerobatic area.
            3.21.2.1.5. Immediately use the phraseology “KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF,
            KNOCK IT OFF” to terminate DEMO operations upon receipt of a “STOP THE DEMO”
            call from the RAPCON.
            3.21.2.1.6. No aerobatic maneuvers may be performed over any open air assembly of persons
            or congested area of any city, town or settlement.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                         47


        3.21.2.1.7. The 4 FW Demonstration Team will be given local traffic priority as determined
        by this instruction.
    3.21.2.2. Seymour Johnson RAPCON is designated as the liaison facility for coordination with
    Washington Center for use of the aerobatic area and shall:
        3.21.2.2.1. Request the airspace from Washington Center no less than 15 minutes prior to
        planned usage.
        3.21.2.2.2. Once a demo aircraft is airborne, initiate a point-out with affected sectors of Wash-
        ington Center to include the assigned discreet beacon code of demonstration aircraft.
        3.21.2.2.3. Provide VFR traffic advisories based on radar observed traffic or other available
        knowledge of VFR traffic operating in the aerobatic airspace.
        3.21.2.2.4. Release the aerobatic area airspace to the Washington ARTCC when not in use.
        3.21.2.2.5. Return aerobatic area airspace to Center upon request. RAPCON and Center will
        coordinate a time for the return based on traffic conditions.
        3.21.2.2.6. Immediately relay to the Control Tower any “STOP THE DEMO” advisories
        received from Washington Center.
    3.21.2.3. The Safety Observer, ATC, aircraft commander, SOF or designated representative is
    authorized to halt or cancel activity in the aerobatic area if, at any time, the safety of persons or
    property on the ground or in the air is in jeopardy. The phraseology “KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK
    IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF” shall be used if the terminating or canceling activity in the aerobatic
    area is required.
    3.21.2.4. The requirements of AFI 11-246, Vol 1 and the ACC Supplement shall be adhered to at
    all times. No person may operate an aircraft in aerobatic flight when the visibility is less than 3
    miles ground and 5 miles inflight or there is no discernible horizon. All maneuvers shall be con-
    ducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)/See and Avoid. For the FLAT, LOW and
    HIGH shows the weather ceiling requirements are as follows: FLAT show (non-aerobatic) –
    1,500’; LOW show – 2,500’; HIGH show 7,000’.
    3.21.2.5. Before commencing aerobatic flight operations, Airfield Management shall authorize
    activation and deactivation of the aerobatic area via NOTAM action and shall be responsible for
    advising the Raleigh-Durham Flight Service Station (FSS) at 919-840-0263 (1-800-992-7433) of
    the activity. The NOTAM will include the following information:
        3.21.2.5.1. The location, date(s) and time(s) the aerobatic activity will be in effect.
        3.21.2.5.2. If appropriate, the RWY(s) that will be closed during the aerobatic activities.
    3.21.2.6. Aerobatic flight is only permitted 1 hour after official sunrise until 1 hour before official
    sunset. The area will only be used during the specified time contained in the NOTAM. The area
    goes into effect at the start time of the NOTAM and terminates at the end time of the NOTAM.
    3.21.2.7. The FAA/FSDO has the authority to cancel the certificate of waiver or delay any activi-
    ties if the safety of persons or property on the ground or in the air is in jeopardy, or if there is a vio-
    lation of the terms of the waiver or authorization.

3.22. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Procedures. 4 CES/CED shall coordinate with Control
Tower Watch Supervisor prior to conducting range operations that may affect flying operations. Tower
will sterilize the affected airspace and inform EOD via the Tower NET, “EOD operations approved,
advise of termination.” Immediately after last successful detonation, EOD will inform Tower over the
TOWER NET that all detonations are complete. If at any time airspace sterilization is not assured, Tower
will call “KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF” over TOWER Net to request EOD to halt operations. EOD
non-range operations in the flightline environment are normally associated with emergency operations,
and therefore will be coordinated through the On Scene Commander (OSC) or Senior Firefighting Offi-
cial (SFO).
NOTE: Range operation coordination between Tower and EOD shall take place real-time to resolve
delays, extensions, additional detonations, etc.

3.23. Parachute Drops in Class D Airspace. These activities require ATC authorization and should be
processed far enough in advance to allow for ease in planning and support. Parachute jump operations
must be defined in an LOP between the responsible organization/individuals and 4 FW. Requests should
be forwarded to the Airfield Operations Flight through the Airfield Manager.

3.24. Minimum Communication (MINCOM) Launch (SILENT WARRIOR). 4 FW Aircrew will
accomplish the following IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3CH8, SJAFB Supplement 1:
     3.24.1. The flight lead/aircraft commander will coordinate with RAPCON and SOF. This will include
     call sign, flight plan, start time, taxi and takeoff time (add interval/flight spacing if non-standard). The
     SOF will keep the Tower Watch Supervisor informed.
     3.24.2. The aircrew will file their flight plan a minimum of 2 hours prior to launch. Include the entry
     "SILENT WARRIOR" in the remarks section.
     3.24.3. Prior to stepping to the aircraft, the flight lead/aircraft commander will call the SOF to pass
     start, taxi, takeoff times, and a list of spares (plus formation information if a flight). He/she will also
     call RAPCON to copy a clearance and pass proposed takeoff time. After delivering the clearance,
     RAPCON will update the takeoff time on their strip to the revised proposed takeoff time.
     3.24.4. The aircraft/flight will start engines and taxi on time +/- 5 minutes. Spares will taxi within 15
     minutes of scheduled taxi time or notify the SOF via landline of updated taxi times/requests. All air-
     craft involved will listen to ATIS prior to taxi and will monitor all normal radio frequencies until
     checking in with departure.
     3.24.5. The SOF and Tower personnel will monitor taxi by matching tail numbers to call sign on the
     flying schedule.
     3.24.6. When ready for immediate takeoff (arming and checks complete), turn towards the Tower, and
     flash taxi lights to signal ready for takeoff.
     3.24.7. The Tower will signal with a steady green light to clear the aircraft for takeoff. Takeoff clear-
     ance is for immediate takeoff; flight/aircraft should be airborne within 2 minutes.
     3.24.8. These procedures can be terminated by anyone in the interest of safety. Full communications
     will be restored to issue emergency instructions.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     49


3.25. Landing Light Check for 4 FW Aircraft. Unless 4 FW aircrew have previously reported their
aircraft’s landing light out of service, all controllers are requested to remain vigilant and advise 4 FW
F-15E aircrew on each approach when a landing light is not observed. The intent of this advisory is solely
to remind aircrew to check and confirm gear status and not to place responsibility on the controller. This
advisory is in addition to USAF policy requiring air traffic controllers to advise pilots who have not pre-
viously reported gear down, to check wheels down. When controllers do not observe a 4 FW F-15E air-
craft on approach displaying a landing light, controllers will issue advisories to that effect.
PHRASEOLOGY-
“(ACID) APPEARS NEGATIVE LANDING LIGHT, CHECK WHEELS DOWN”
When landing light is observed following a negative landing light advisory issue:
“(ACID) LANDING LIGHT APPEARS ON”

3.26. Variable Wind Information:
   3.26.1. Seymour Johnson air traffic controllers will issue variable wind for changes IAW AFI 13-203,
   para 4.5.
   3.26.2. Issuance of variable wind advisories should not interfere or congest radio communications
   between Tower and aircrew. During periods of heavy traffic, tower controllers may forgo issuance of
   variable wind data for each aircraft approach and opt to generally broadcast the advisories when time
   and workload permits.

3.27. Radar Approach (PAR/ASR) Availability:
   3.27.1. Seymour Johnson has a single RFC (Radar Final Control), i.e. PAR/ASR requirement. If it is
   operationally advantageous, RFC 2 may be operated IAW 4 OSS/OSAR OI 13-203.
   3.27.2. The RAPCON will be staffed to provide PAR and ASR approaches Monday - Friday from
   0800L to 2000L. In addition, a minimum of one RFC position will be open to cover normally sched-
   uled 4 FW flying regardless of day or time. RFC will be manned, by request only, for 916 ARW mis-
   sions outside of the above times; make requests with the RAPCON Chief Controller.

3.28. Civil Twilight Operations. See AFI 11-214, Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack Con-
troller Procedures for Air Operations paragraph 2.7.6, and AFI 11-2F-15EV3, F-15E Operations Proce-
dures.
   3.28.1. Use day rules and procedures (operational and training) during civil twilight (defined in the
   air almanac maintained by 4 OSS/OSW). Use night or weather procedures when adverse conditions
   exist during civil twilight. Without access to the air almanac, consider civil twilight to be 30 minutes
   before sunrise until sunrise, and from sunset until 30 minutes after sunset.
   3.28.2. 4 FW aircraft may use the overhead pattern during civil twilight at the SOF’s discretion. If
   there is no SOF available, the discretion to use the overhead pattern during civil twilight goes to the
   Tower Watch Supervisor.

3.29. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH):

     3.29.1. Responsibilities of all concerned agencies are defined in the 4 FW BASH Plan. This plan can
     be found on the 4 FW Plans and Evaluations webpage under 4 FW Plans Index: https://wwwmil.sey-
     mourjohnson.af.mil/xp/Plans%20Index%201.htm
     3.29.2. When a Bird Watch Condition (BWC) is declared, operations will be affected as follows
     (low-level and range restrictions can be found in the BASH Plan):
        3.29.2.1. BWC LOW: Normal operations. No restrictions on low-level flight.
        3.29.2.2. BWC MODERATE: No formation take-offs or landings. Overhead pattern is closed.
        Delete the 1000’ hold-down restriction on departure. Restricted low approaches authorized to 700’
        AGL minimum.
        3.29.2.3. BWC SEVERE: No takeoffs or landings. Airfield closed except to emergency aircraft.
        Aircraft returning to base proceed to an appropriate holding fix and contact the SOF.

4.2. Crash Alarm System. Authority to determine which activities will be assigned a crash alarm station
number will be IAW AFI 13-203, AFI 13-213 and the 4 OSS/CC. Any activity desiring assignment of a
crash alarm station will submit an AF Form 3215, Communications Requirements Document, to 4 CS/
SCX through 4 OSS/OSAA and the 4 OSS/CC. The request will be accomplished as a telephone work
order.
     4.2.1. The Primary Crash Alarm System is activated by the Tower when advised of an emergency by
     a credible source. The Primary Crash Alarm System consists of the following:
        4.2.1.1. Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops).
        4.2.1.2. Fire Station (Crash).
        4.2.1.3. Clinic (Flight Surgeon/Emergency Room).
NOTE: After normal duty hours the clinic will not answer the Crash Phone. The Fire Station will be
responsible for dispatching an ambulance for emergency response.
        4.2.1.4. Command Post (Receive Only).
     4.2.2. Alternate Primary Crash Circuit: If the Primary Crash Circuit is inoperative, the Tower will
     complete notification as follows:
        4.2.2.1. AM Operations: Direct line/x-4097/Ramp Net.
        4.2.2.2. Crash: Direct line/x-7588, x-7589/Crash Net.
52                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


        4.2.2.3. Clinic: During normal duty hours call the Flight Surgeon at x-1580, x-1802; after normal
        duty hours call the Crash Station according to para 4.2.2.2. above.
     4.2.3. Secondary Crash Alarm System: AM Ops will relay information verbatim on the Secondary
     Crash Phone immediately after terminating the Primary or Alternate Crash Phone transmission. Sta-
     tions not answering will be called via telephone.
        4.2.3.1. The clinic will not answer the Secondary Crash Phone after duty hours. Fire Department
        will perform the necessary coordination.

        4.2.3.2. Activation of the Secondary Crash Net is not predicated on activation of the primary net,
        since all agencies on the primary net, excluding the Tower, are also on the secondary net. A
        quicker response may be obtained through sole activation of the secondary net.
        4.2.3.3. If the Secondary Crash Net is unavailable, AM Ops will activate the Secondary Crash
        Phone.

4.3. Procedures for Answering the Crash Phone. Personnel responsible for answering the crash phone
will be briefed on the following procedures:
     4.3.1. Pick-up the telephone receiver and identify your agency if transmit capable. (ex. “Am Ops on”
     4.3.2. Listen--do not say anything.
     4.3.3. Copy all information.
     4.3.4. Do not interrupt or offer any information on the crash net. AM Ops or Tower will give you all
     the information they know. They will ask for “ANY QUESTIONS” at the end of message transmis-
     sion. Ask for clarification only.
     4.3.5. Secure phone when AM Ops or Tower has released you.

4.4. Crash Phone Information for Inflight Emergency. Tower will relay the following information:
     4.4.1. Aircraft Call Sign.
     4.4.2. Aircraft Type.
     4.4.3. Nature of Emergency.
     4.4.4. Present Location.
     4.4.5. Landing RWY.
     4.4.6. Estimated Landing Time (ETA).
     4.4.7. Wind.
     4.4.8. Fuel Remaining in Time.
     4.4.9. Number of Personnel Aboard.
     4.4.10. Armament Status, as applicable (If IFE involves F-16, indicate if hydrazine is a factor).
     4.4.11. Aircraft will or will not engage arresting system.
     4.4.12. Pilot’s desires.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     53


NOTE: Crash phone activation will not be delayed due to lack of information. Available information will
be passed, and if necessary, the PCAS will be re-activated to pass additional information.

4.5. Crash Phone Information for Aircraft/Disaster/Exercise Inputs:
   4.5.1. Specific procedures to provide rapid and orderly response in the event of an aircraft accident or
   disaster control problem are outlined in current 4 FW Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan 10-2 and
   AFI 91-204. 4 FW Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan 10-2 can be found on the 4 FW Plans and
   Evaluations webpage under 4 FW Plans Index: https://wwwmil.seymourjohnson.af.mil/xp/
   Plans%20Index%201.htm
   4.5.2. Applicable information in paragraph 4.4. should be broadcast, plus coordinates, as follows:
       4.5.2.1. Base Disaster Preparedness grid map for on-base accidents or incidents.
       4.5.2.2. Base Disaster Preparedness Grid Map or Wayne County Grid Map for off base accidents
       or incidents. North Carolina Official highway maps and Tactical Pilotage Charts will be used for
       areas not covered by Base Grid Map or Wayne County Grid Map.
       4.5.2.3. Assembly location for the Disaster Control Group (DCG) when recalled by 4 MSG/CC.
       If the designated primary or secondary assembly areas are used, do not give grid coordinates. Oth-
       erwise, give grid map coordinates and a common reference (i.e. building number or description).
   4.5.3. If a grid position cannot be determined, generally known geographical references may be used.

4.6. Command and Control:
   4.6.1. Upon advance notification of a 4 FW aircraft emergency, the SOF shall immediately notify
   Control Tower and, when time permits, the LION NET members. RAPCON shall to the extent possi-
   ble assign frequency 277.4 (LC 10) for locally assigned F-15Es. Depending upon the situation, the
   wing commander may immediately convene a unit conference, discuss the situation with appropriate
   staff members, and determine further action to be taken.
   4.6.2. Only ATC agencies, SOF, Chief 1/2 or Command will communicate with the aircraft.
       4.6.2.1. Time permitting, Tower controllers will transmit the following inflight emergency and/or
       suspended RWY operations advisories on Guard and Local Control frequencies:
           4.6.2.1.1. Inflight emergencies: “SEYMOUR TOWER ON GUARD, EMERGENCY IN
           PROGRESS, CABLE ENGAGEMENT ANTICIPATED/NOT ANTICIPATED.”
           4.6.2.1.2. Suspended RWY operations: “SEYMOUR TOWER ON GUARD, RWY OPERA-
           TIONS SUSPENDED FOR (reason), EXPECT (minute or hour)DELAY FOR NORMAL
           OPERATIONS.”
           4.6.2.1.3. Resuming RWY operations: “SEYMOUR TOWER ON GUARD, RWY OPEN,
           RESUMING NORMAL OPERATIONS.”
       4.6.2.2. When communications are established on LC 10 and ATC is not transmitting control
       instructions, the SOF may use the frequency to communicate with the emergency aircraft after
       obtaining approval from ATC. Unless urgent communications are required from the SOF to the
       aircrew, the SOF must relinquish the frequency when advised to do so by ATC. Only ATC agen-
       cies may transmit control instructions.
54                                                   SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


        4.6.2.3. All ground transmissions on the IFE shared frequency, LC 10, shall be prefaced with the
        aircraft call sign followed by the call sign of the person talking: “FALCON 41, APPROACH” or
        “FALCON 41, LION SOF,” etc.
NOTE: Command will receive control of LC 10 from the Tower after the IFE/GE aircraft has come to a
complete stop on or off the runway. Once Command has terminated the IFE/GE, he/she will relinquish
control of LC 10 back to the Tower.

4.7. Crash Recovery Team:
     4.7.1. Crash Recovery Team will proceed to the OSC or SFO on duty or to the designated standby
     location (Figure 4.1.) with their standard, preassembled equipment, and await instructions. The Crash
     Recovery Team Chief will notify the OSC when wing aircraft ground handling equipment is required.
     Fuels Management will be notified prior to debris removal to ensure fuel samples have been obtained
     for the safety investigation board. The Crash Recovery Team Chief/members will then complete the
     aircraft or accident debris movement as directed by the OSC. The OSC will coordinate with the safety
     investigation board president before any debris is moved. Only the Crash Recovery Team Chief will
     issue directions to the crash crew.
     4.7.2. All other persons attempting to issue instructions will be advised that all directions must be
     accelerated to the maximum extent consistent with safety. Entry and exit of Crash Recovery vehicles
     on the active RWY will be only as directed by the OSC. On weekends or holidays, when the wing
     does not have any scheduled takeoffs or landings, the Crash Recovery team may operate on a
     45-minute maximum response time standby status. This may begin after termination of flying on Fri-
     day or the evening prior to a holiday and terminate in normal duty section standby prior to the begin-
     ning of flying the next day.

Figure 4.1. EMERGENCY VEHICLE ASSEMBLY AREAS
(See NOTES 1-3 below)




NOTES:
     1. Emergency/Crash response vehicles will assemble in the area between Foxtrot and Golf Rows
        opposite TWY Echo.
      2. For barrier engagements, selected equipment is positioned as noted below:
          a. Crash Recovery, EOD, EOR, and Fire: Opposite TWY Charlie or Golf
          b. Power Production: At BAK-12 crash road “HOLD” line
          c. Airfield Manager: TWY Bravo or Juliet “HOLD” line
      3. Vehicle movement out of assembly area(s) to the distressed aircraft shall not occur without
         prior approval from the OSC.

4.8. Airfield Management Operations Responsibilities:
   4.8.1. Activate the Secondary Crash circuit after each Primary activation.
56                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


     4.8.2. Close/Suspend RWY (if applicable).
     4.8.3. Respond to airfield and assist as necessary.
     4.8.4. Once SFO indicates their function is complete, inspect the RWY and any other affected areas.
     Report status and certify to Tower when normal operations may resume. RWY checks will be con-
     ducted by AM Ops with the cooperation of the SOF. The intent is for a FOD sweep to be accom-
     plished after each IFE. Every attempt should be made by AM Ops to check the RWY for FOD after
     emergencies. However, if the SOF determines that the particular emergency does not present a FOD
     hazard, he/she will advise AM Ops that an airfield check is not warranted.
     4.8.5. Relay grid coordinates via the Secondary Crash Phone once received from the Fire Department
     or Control Tower.

4.9. Fire Department Responsibilities:
     4.9.1. The Fire Chief or SFO on duty will respond with appropriate equipment and assume On-Scene
     Commander duties.
     4.9.2. Advise the Control Tower of any special handling requests to be relayed to the emergency air-
     craft (i.e. stop straight ahead, do not turn off RWY, etc).
     4.9.3. Assume control of LC 10 once the aircraft has come to a complete stop. Advise Tower when
     assuming control of LC 10.
     4.9.4. When the emergency is terminated or when the affected area can be released for operations,
     inform AM Ops and Tower immediately.
     4.9.5. Determine and relay grid coordinates to AM Ops for dissemination over the Secondary Crash
     Alarm System, unless previously determined and relayed by the Tower.
     4.9.6. If necessary, operate airfield lighting for an emergency during non-published airfield operating
     hours utilizing the lighting vault.

4.10. 4 FW Safety Responsibilities:
     4.10.1. During emergencies, Dover 1/2 will respond and position on the flightline clear of emergency
     vehicles/routes.
     4.10.2. Directly after the scene is declared safe, Dover 2 may act as the lead safety investigator until
     relieved the Chief of Safety.
     4.10.3. During cable engagements, 4 FW/SE will position outside the CMA in order to film the
     engagement remaining clear of emergency vehicles.

4.11. Daily Crash Phone Checks. Tower will conduct a daily check of the Primary Crash Circuit and
immediately following, AM Ops will check the Secondary Crash Circuit for proper operation. Crash cir-
cuit checks will be initiated daily by the Tower at approximately 0830L, except when an emergency is in
progress. All inoperative stations will be reported to the 4 CS Help Desk (2-5003) by the Tower for the
Primary Circuit, and by AM Ops for the Secondary Circuit.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                      57


4.12. Emergency Landings. Pilots will notify ATC or the SOF of nature of emergency, fuel on board
and intentions. If ordnance is carried, include the type and quantity of armament in the initial call to ATC
or the SOF.

4.13. Emergency Fuel Radar Pattern. Aircraft will remain within 8 NM at an altitude of 1,900’ MSL
and will be established on final approach no closer than 5 1/2 miles from touchdown.

4.14. Jettison Areas:
   4.14.1. VFR External Stores/Cargo Jettison Area is defined as the portion of the airfield s south of
   RWY 08/26, 100’ wide by 6,500’ long, starting at the centerline of the abandoned TWY east of TWY
   D and proceeding eastward. The northern boundary is 350’ south of the RWY. The area is described as
   a grassy area and ditch bordered by a tree line to the south. Security Forces, with the assistance of the
   Airfield Manager and other emergency personnel, will clear the area of personnel and vehicles (See
   Figure 4.2.).
       4.14.1.1. Aircrew will notify ATC as soon as possible of the need to use the VFR area. They will
       then hold as assigned until the Control Tower has issued clearance to use the jettison area.
       4.14.1.2. Tower will activate Primary Crash Phone and visually check the area for personnel and
       vehicles. If any are observed, Tower will notify AM Ops. After AM Ops has notified the Tower
       the drop area is clear, Tower will approve the aircraft’s pass for a drop. “(Aircraft call sign)
       ENTRY FOR JETTISON APPROVED.”
       4.14.1.3. AM Ops will activate Secondary Crash Net after Tower has activated Primary Crash
       Net. They will then notify Security Forces to sweep the jettison area and clear personnel and vehi-
       cles from the area immediately and will notify Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) of the drop (if
       applicable).
       4.14.1.4. After the drop occurs, AM Ops will inspect all affected airfield areas and inform Tower
       of RWY status.
       4.14.1.5. Security Forces will respond immediately to cordon off the affected area and evacuate
       personnel and vehicles. Inform AM Ops when area is cleared.

Figure 4.2. VFR JETTISON AREA




     4.14.2. IFR External Stores Disposal/Cargo Jettison/Controlled Bailout/Aircraft Abandonment Area:
     SJAFB emergency aircraft requiring the use of this area will contact RAPCON or the SOF and can
     expect a frequency change to local channel 10. The emergency aircraft will proceed outbound on the
     GSB 291 degree radial at 2200’ MSL. Jettison/bailout should occur at 11 DME and no later than 13
     DME. Vectors can be obtained from RAPCON who will call entering and exiting the area. If under
     IFR and receiving vectors, bailout/jettison should occur within 20 seconds of RAPCON’s “ENTER-
     ING” call to ensure action is complete by 13 DME. Controllers will relay position information to
     appropriate authorities. No off-base crash grid map exists.
     4.14.3. Fuel Dump. The designated inflight fuel dump area is TBOLT (GSB 145/18) at or above
     10,000’ MSL. Fuel jettison will be limited to emergency situations or when an urgent operational
     requirement exists.
NOTE: IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3, only conduct fuel dumping to reduce gross weight for safety of flight.
When circumstances permit, dump above 10,000’AGL over unpopulated areas.
        4.14.3.1. Aircraft shall notify ATC or the SOF before dumping fuel. ATC will provide required
        separation from the aircraft dumping fuel and issue advisories to other aircraft.
        4.14.3.2. The SOF will notify the unit Environmental Protection Coordinator (4 CES/CEV) as
        soon as possible after fuel dumping.

4.15. Hot Brakes Aircraft:
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                        59


WARNING: Hot brakes normally attain peak temperatures 12 to 15 minutes after the initial brake appli-
cation with a minimum cool period of 30 minutes. Taxiing the aircraft in an attempt to cool the brakes by
airflow only aggravates the severity of the condition. Therefore, taxiing should be restricted only as nec-
essary to arrive at the hot brake area. Heated brake guidance can be found in TO 00-105E-9 and TO
4B-1-1.
   4.15.1. Potential hot brake situations may occur at any location on the airfield. Hot brake situations
   are always considered “potential” until verified by the Crash Recovery Team Chief. Notification will
   usually occur through ATC or the 4 FW MOCC.
   4.15.2. If potential hot brakes occur in the aircraft parking area: 1) With aircraft engines shut down,
   all nonessential personnel will be evacuated and, if practical, nearby aircraft within a 300’ radius will
   be removed. 2) With aircraft engines running, the aircraft will taxi to the nearest hot brakes area and
   point the nose of the aircraft into the wind. KC-135Rs will be directed to TWY G.
       4.15.2.1. The east hot brake area is marked by a 5’ x 5’ painted yellow square on TWY G. The
       alternate east hot brake area is the arm/de-arm spot on TWY J closest to the instrument hold line.
       4.15.2.2. The west hot brake area is marked by a 5’ x 5’ painted yellow square on TWY F or, with
       winds from the south, a 5’ x 5’ painted yellow square on TWY C approximately 300’ from TWY
       A. The alternate west hot brake area is the arm/de-armspot on TWY B closest to the instrument
       hold line.
   4.15.3. If potential hot brakes occur on the RWY or a TWY, the aircrew will notify the SOF and ATC
   and taxi to the nearest hot brake area and point the nose of the aircraft into the wind.
       4.15.3.1. ATC will activate the Primary Crash Phone and will direct other aircraft and vehicles to
       avoid passing within 300’ of the hot brakes aircraft, if practical. The Fire Department will respond
       to the hot brakes aircraft, take control of the emergency once the aircraft is stopped, and assume a
       surveillance position no closer than 300’ unless the Fire Department determines that a fire is
       imminent.
       4.15.3.2. MOCC and Secondary Crash NET will notify Crash Recovery and advise of aircraft tail
       number and location. The Crash Recovery Team Chief will assume overall responsibility follow-
       ing the LJG-4FW-0041 for recovery operations once the emergencyis terminated.
   4.15.4. After the aircraft with potential hot brakes arrives at the appropriate hot brakes area, the SFO
   will take control of the emergency once the aircraft has stopped. The fire department will approach the
   aircraft, chock the aircraft, assume a surveillance position no closer than 300’ from the aircraft, and,
   in conjunction with the Crash Recovery Team Chief, make an initial assessment of the situation. It is
   necessary that the aircraft be chocked so that the aircrew does not have to apply the wheel brakes. Use
   of wheel brakes greatly increases the risk of fire in a hot brakes situation. Once the aircraft is chocked,
   the aircrew will not apply the wheel brakes or holding brake.
       4.15.4.1. If the aircraft is assessed as NOT SAFE to approach, the aircrew will remain in the air-
       craft with engines running and monitor LC 10, or Ground ( LC 2), and the SOF (Ch 9) frequencies
       and await further instructions. The aircrew should be prepared to emergency ground egress if nec-
       essary.
       4.15.4.2. If the aircraft is assessed as SAFE to approach, Crash Recovery will approach the air-
       craft to determine if a hot brake condition exists.

     4.15.4.2.1. If a "HOT BRAKE CONDITION EXISTS" Crash Recovery will standby at a safe
     location maintaining radio or verbal contact with the OSC during the "30 minute countdown".
     Aircraft will be chocked by Fire Emergency Services Personnel to allow the aircrew to release
     the brakes and wait in the aircraft during the 30 minute countdown. Once the OSC has made
     the determination (through crash recovery) that the brakes are cooled down enough to con-
     tinue operations, personnel will be allowed to approach the aircraft and continue the de-arming
     process.
     4.15.4.2.2. If Crash Recovery determines a HOT BRAKE CONDITION DOES NOT EXIST,
     the aircrew will be directed to taxi the aircraft to arm/de-arm or parking as appropriate.

4.16. Gun or Other Ordnance Malfunctions:
   4.16.1. Definitions:
      4.16.1.1. Failure to Release. Ordnance would not release when all appropriate switches were
      selected and an attempt was made to release.
      4.16.1.2. Hung Ordnance. Any item attached to the aircraft for the purpose of dropping (or firing),
      which has malfunctioned and failed to release.
      4.16.1.3. Inadvertent Firing. Any gun, which fails to stop firing after the trigger is released, fires
      prior to the trigger being depressed, or fires without command.
      4.16.1.4. Inadvertent Release. Ordnance that has been fired or dropped without command by the
      aircrew. Any release from a dispenser of training stores that is different than selected; for example,
      double bomb release when a single release was intended will be considered a system abnormality
      rather than an inadvertent release.
      4.16.1.5. Jammed Gun. Any un-commanded stoppage during firing.
      4.16.1.6. Live Ordnance. Combat-type ordnance incorporating explosive or incendiary material,
      including LUU-1B flares. Spotting charges are not live ordnance.
      4.16.1.7. Misfire. Forward or aft firing ordnance that fails to fire upon command.
      4.16.1.8. Training Ordnance. Ordnance with the explosive or incendiary material removed or ord-
      nance specifically designed for training. MK-106, BDU-33, 2.75 Forward Firing Ordnance (inert),
      inert MK-82/84, and 20 mm ball or tracer is classified as training ordnance.
      4.16.1.9. Unexpended Ordnance. Ordnance carried, but no attempt has been made to employ it.
      4.16.1.10. Unintentional Release. Ordnance fired or dropped through aircrew error.
NOTE: AIRCRAFT WITH LIVE ORDNANCE REMAINING WILL TAXI BACK ONLY TO AN
APPROVED LIVE ORDNANCE AREA.
   4.16.2. Procedures:
      4.16.2.1. The aircrew will advise RAPCON or Tower when returning to SJAFB with a known or
      suspected gun malfunction. Aircrew will plan a straight-in recovery. Notification will consist of:
          4.16.2.1.1. Call sign and aircraft tail number
          4.16.2.1.2. Type of gun malfunction
          4.16.2.1.3. ETA and Fuel Remaining
      4.16.2.2. Control Tower will notify the SOF, or Command Post if SOF is not in Tower.
      4.16.2.3. SOF will notify the Command Post.
      4.16.2.4. Command Post will notify: EOD, MOCC and Wing Safety.
      4.16.2.5. MOCC will notify all agencies on their checklist and the maintenance controller will
      notify the Armament Shop first to ensure a timely response that is consistent with other key play-
      ers. The respective AMU Weapons Expediter will be notified and dispatched to the respective
      jammed gun parking location.
64                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


        4.16.2.6. The aircrew will park in the appropriate malfunctioning gun spot per directions from the
        Control Tower (see Figure 4.3. and Figure 4.4.). The jammed gun areas are as follows:
            4.16.2.6.1. The east jammed gun area is the spot closest to the instrument hold line on TWY J
            east hammerhead, heading 105 degrees, pulled forward into the hot brake area. The alternate
            area is the middle spot on TWY G, heading 105 degrees.
            4.16.2.6.2. The west jammed gun area is the spot closest to the instrument hold line on the
            TWY B west hammerhead, heading 230 degrees, pulled forward into the hot brakes area. The
            alternate area is the middle spot on TWY C, heading 230 degrees.
            4.16.2.6.3. If more than one aircraft has a jammed gun, use the next spot closest to the instru-
            ment hold line. If an aircraft with hot brakes is in the designated hot brakes area, use the alter-
            nate area to park aircraft with jammed guns.
        4.16.2.7. The SFO will act as the OSC and will ensure the aircraft is fire safe prior to releasing the
        aircraft to Crash Recovery. The EOR de-arm crew will then perform normal aircraft safing proce-
        dures, to include installing a gun electrical safety pin.
        4.16.2.8. The owning AMU flightline weapons personnel will attempt to safe the gun with the
        assistance of EOD. If the system can be rotated and safed, the aircraft will be released to return to
        the parking ramp. If the gun system is jammed or the condition of the gun cannot be determined,
        the aircraft will be shut down on the spot and the Armament Shop will render assistance in clear-
        ing the gun. EOD will determine disposition of removed rounds. Always ensure the aircraft is
        parked with the gun pointing in the least hazardous direction (see Figure 4.3. and Figure 4.4.).
        4.16.2.9. The gun system will be downloaded prior to any troubleshooting of the system being
        performed.
        4.16.2.10. Under no circumstances will an aircraft be taxied or towed back to the F-15E ramp
        when the breech bolts of the gun are in the firing position. 4 FW Weapons Safety and the Wing
        Weapons Manager will be immediately notified when any aircraft on the F-15E ramp is discov-
        ered with the gun system having or suspected of having breech bolts in the firing position. An
        Operational Risk Management assessment must be performed to determine the best course of
        action to clear the gun system.
     4.16.3. Hung or Inadvertent Chaff/Flare Procedures:
        4.16.3.1. Aircrew Responsibilities:
            4.16.3.1.1. Notify RAPCON/Tower of the condition, maintain VFR and avoid populated
            areas.
            4.16.3.1.2. Upon landing, the aircraft will be parked in the hung ordnance areas (see Figure
            4.3. and Figure 4.4.).
            4.16.3.1.3. If an arriving aircraft has a hung chaff/flare, the aircraft will land RWY 08 and turn
            off the RWY on TWY G and park in the middle spot of TWY G. If a turnoff cannot be made,
            the aircraft can request a 180-degree turn on the RWY and taxi back to TWY G. The SOF may
            approve landing on RWY 26 and safe/de-arm on WY C.
            4.16.3.1.4. If an aircraft on the ground is discovered with a hung chaff/flare, the aircraft can
            park in the alternate area, the closest spot to the instrument hold line on TWY J and B hammer-
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                      65


         heads, or taxi to the primary area on TWY G or C. If more than one aircraft has a hung chaff/
         flare, use the next spot closest to the instrument hold line.
     4.16.3.2. Ground Crew Responsibilities:
         4.16.3.2.1. The responding fire department personnel will ensure the munitions have not
         ignited.
         4.16.3.2.2. When cleared by the SFO, the responding Crash Recovery crew will chock the air-
         craft and clear the area. EOD will electrically safe the chaff/flare dispenser and establish actual
         status of the munitions.
         4.16.3.2.3. If there are no indications of a misfire, hang fire, or otherwise displaced chaff/
         flare, the aircraft will be allowed to return to the parking ramp after normal aircraft EOR saf-
         ing procedures have been accomplished.
         4.16.3.2.4. If there is any evidence of a problem or any doubt about the actual condition, the
         chaff/flare dispenser will be secured by EOD, and then the aircraft will be shut down. The dis-
         penser or module will be downloaded by EOD before the aircraft is towed to the F-15E ramp.
         4.16.3.2.5. At no time will a dispenser or module be removed while power is applied or if the
         aircraft engines are operating.
  4.16.4. Any time the ALE-45 system is activated and no release occurs, normal landing procedures
  will be followed. If an inadvertent release is suspected, the pilot will fly a straight-in approach and
  ensure the module is safed prior to taxiing back.
  4.16.5. Aircraft with hung live ordnance:
     4.16.5.1. Aircraft with hung live ordnance will park in the hung ordnance areas (see Figure 4.3.
     and Figure 4.4.).
     4.16.5.2. EOR personnel will attempt to safe/pin all loaded stations. If ordnance can be safed/
     pinned, the aircraft will taxi back to the designated parking location.
     4.16.5.3. If an unsafe condition exists beyond the capabilities of the EOR crew, notify MOCC
     who will notify the appropriate weapons expediter. Shut down engines, egress aircrews, and wait
     for EOD personnel or additional guidance.
  4.16.6. Captive AIM 9 (Broken Dome) Procedures:
     4.16.6.1. Aircrew Responsibilities:
         4.16.6.1.1. Notify RAPCON/Tower of the condition (if known), maintain VFR and avoid
         populated areas.
         4.16.6.1.2. Upon landing, the aircraft will be parked at EOR, furthest spot from RWY to
         ensure flying is not impeded.
         4.16.6.1.3. If an aircraft on the ground is discovered with a broken dome cover, the aircraft
         can remain in its location and await emergency ground crew response.
     4.16.6.2. Ground Crew Responsibilities:
66                                                 SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


           4.16.6.2.1. The responding fire department personnel will ensure a 300’ initial cordon is
           established. Upon inspecting the aircraft and aircrew, the Fire Chief/On-Scene Commander,
           can reduce the cordon to immediately around the aircraft and await EOD response.
           4.16.6.2.2. When cleared by the SFO, the responding Crash Recovery crew will chock the air-
           craft and clear the area. EOD will establish actual status of captive AIM 9 and seal area in
           question. After sealing damaged area, aircraft can be parked in F-15E ramp. The responsible
           AMU weapons load crew will download the missile and turn over to Munitions Maintenance
           for disposition.

4.17. EOR Operations During a Hot Brakes, Jammed Gun, or Hung Chaff/Flare. Arriving aircraft
will be instructed to exit the RWY at TWY J (RWY 08 in use) or TWY B (RWY 26 in use) when a
jammed gun is in progress. If necessary, EOR operations will be moved to TWYs G and C. TWYs G and
C are the primary parking spots for hot brakes or hung ordnance operations with TWY J and B as the
alternates. These procedures do not replace the judgment of the Tower Watch Supervisor on duty if
another course of action is warranted.

4.18. Hydrazine Maintenance Procedures. If RWY 26 is active, the aircraft declaring an Emergency
Power Unit (EPU) activation/hydrazine leak will be directed to TWY B. If RWY 08 is active, then the air-
craft declaring the EPU activation/hydrazine leak will be directed to TWY J. Whenever possible, aircraft
declaring an emergency due to an EPU activation/hydrazine leak will be directed to land on RWY 08
because TWY J is the optimum location on the airfield for conducting hydrazine operations.

4.19. Inflight Emergencies during Non-Published Hours. Inflight emergencies during non-published
hours will be handled IAW paragraph 1.5. of this instruction.

                                FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

5.1. General. IAW AFI 13-213, Airfield Management, all aircraft departing SJAFB must have a flight
plan on file with AM Ops prior to takeoff.
   5.1.1. Military aircraft will use DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan or DD Form 1801, DoD Inter-
   national Flight Plan, or other authorized forms according to AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight
   Rules, and FLIP General Planning.
   5.1.2. Civilian aircraft may use an approved FAA flight plan in lieu of the military forms.

5.2. Stereo Flight Plans. Local area coded flight plans may be filed with AM Ops by aircrew or squad-
ron operations via direct line (2-4097) or fax (2-4100). If flight plans are faxed, flying squadrons must
retain the original DD Forms 175 or 1801 on file for 90 days. Include the following information: Radio
Call Sign, Aircraft Type and Number, Estimated Departure Time, and Code Name of Canned or Stereo
Flight Plan.

5.3. Split Recoveries. Local flight plans that include a delay in a working area have a split recovery
available. Upon request, split recoveries are available on all stereos that have more than one leg. All oth-
ers must file DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan.
   5.3.1. Aircrews must request a "split recovery" when filing flight plans with AM Ops and provide the
   dispatcher with the call sign of the second element. Washington Center will then have two strips for
   the recovery portion of the flight plan. Flight leads have the option of recovering together or departing
   the working area with 2 minutes (8 miles minimum) separation and obtaining individual IFR clear-
   ances for recovery.
   5.3.2. Flights separating after air refueling to accomplish different missions will file a separate flight
   plan for each aircraft or element.

5.4. File Times. Flight plans should be filed at least 1 hour prior to proposed takeoff time. When using
radial and DME or latitude and longitude positions, crews should file at least 2 hours prior to proposed
takeoff. During 4 FW surge operations, flight plans should be filed 2 1/2 hours prior to proposed depar-
ture. DD Form 1801 should be filed at least 2 hours prior to proposed takeoff time.

5.5. Units TDY to SJAFB. Units/aircraft TDY to SJAFB shall file their flight plans in person or estab-
lish a Letter of Agreement between SJAFB AM Ops and that unit to fax flight plans to AM Ops dispatch
section. Local Stereo routes are intended only for 4 FW aircraft; however, stereo routes may be used by
TDY aircraft if a Letter of Agreement is submitted to AM Ops 48 hours prior.

5.6. Altitude Reservation (ALTRV) Procedures. All aircrew members filing for an ALTRV should
review the DoD Flight Information Publication General Planning Guide, Chapter 4 prior to filing. The
following local procedures also apply to aide local aircrews:
   5.6.1. Aircrews will:
68                                                 SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


       5.6.1.1. Notify Airfield Management and Air Traffic Control (RAPCON) at least 72 hours in
       advance of filing an ALTRV.
       5.6.1.2. Invite a RAPCON representative and an Airfield Management representative to attend
       the mission planning meetings involving ALTRV procedures. In addition to allowing RAPCON/
       AMOPs to gain insight regarding the mission and flight’s intentions, this will also permit them to
       review the proposed flight plan(s) to ensure that the routings contain the appropriate ALTRV
       requirements and help prevent any confusion with ARTCC after departure.
       5.6.1.3. Hand carry the ALTRV Flight Plan to Airfield Management to ensure accuracy of filing
       clearance routing to and from the ALTRV portion of the IFR clearance.
NOTE: RAPCON and Airfield Management personnel have the ability to contact Washington Center
Military Liaison to ensure an ALTRV flight plan is ready upon mission departure and avoid unnecessary
mission delays.

                                AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEMS

6.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems Configuration :
   6.1.1. BAK-12 Arresting Cable Systems are the primary arresting system for tail hook equipped air-
   craft. SJAFB has BAK-12 cables located at both approach ends of the RWY and in the overruns. The
   cables are located 1490’ from the approach end of each RWY, 36’ into the RWY 26 overrun, and 52’
   into the RWY 08 overrun. The standard configuration is the approach end, departure end and overrun
   BAK-12 cables connected and the under run cable disconnected. (See Figure 6.1.)

Figure 6.1. ARRESTING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION (RWY 26)




   6.1.2. When changing the arresting system configuration from one RWY to the other, Barrier Mainte-
   nance must be allowed to completely connect the overrun cable. If Barrier Maintenance is instructed
   to exit the RWY before the cable has been completely connected, they must drag the cable back off of
   the RWY before any aircraft lands.
   6.1.3. Any situation which impairs the operational capability of an installed arresting system will be
   immediately reported to the Base Civil Engineer, Airfield Management, Command Post, and Flight
   Safety. Agencies will make higher headquarters notifications through their functional chain of com-
   mand.
   6.1.4. Any cable deficiency will be reported immediately to the CES Power Production Shop. Find-
   ings after duty hours will be reported to CES Customer Service, who will in turn notify power produc-
   tion standby personnel.

6.2. Procedures:
   6.2.1. All agencies responding to arresting system engagements will perform their duties immediately
   after the aircraft is declared safe by the SFO and independently of others unless stopped by the OSC.
   To the maximum extent possible, all assigned tasks should be accomplished simultaneously. 15 min-
   utes is required to reset the BAK-12 cables.
   6.2.2. Mechanical (Tow) Method. The aircrew will ensure that all rearward movement is stopped and
   clearance is received from the fire department signal man. Aircrew will remain in the aircraft unless
   fire is suspected or imminent. This procedure does not preclude the aircrew from evacuating the air-
   craft in the interest of safety. After the emergency aircraft is declared fire safe by the SFO, the crash
   recovery crew will chock the aircraft, shut down left engine, safe landing gear, shut down right engine,
   connect the tail hook tow sling, connect tow vehicle/bar, and disengage the tail hook from the cable.
   EOR personnel will simultaneously inspect and safe all ordnance as required prior to towing aircraft.
70                                                     SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


     6.2.3. Rewinding and resetting of the arresting cable will begin as soon as the hook is disengaged.
     6.2.4. RWY operations may be resumed immediately after the cable is rewound, all vehicles have
     departed the RWY and the RWY check is complete by Airfield Management. At the discretion of the
     OSC, aircraft may be recovered over an un-reset cable if emergency conditions warrant.
     6.2.5. Personnel will be prohibited from standing or walking in front of forward firing ordnance with-
     out properly installed safety pins.
     6.2.6. Records of operational activity and engagements will be kept in the fire station and barrier
     maintenance logbooks. Information will include the date and time of action and a description of the
     event. Each engagement of an arresting system will be documented with the reading from the record-
     ing tachometer and pressure gauge. The SFO will also record the distance of tape pullout, aircraft tail
     number and estimated aircraft weight and speed.

6.3. 4 CES/CC Responsibilities:
     6.3.1. Ensure a Power Production individual with an AF Form 483 (Certificate of Competency) is
     available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
     6.3.2. Maintain all arresting systems.
     6.3.3. Operate arresting systems during RWY changes and engagements.
     6.3.4. Certify arresting systems prior to the flying day, after any engagement, after RWY end changes,
     and periodically inspect arresting systems throughout flying days.
     6.3.5. Advise AM Ops and Control Tower personnel of any malfunction of the arresting systems and
     the estimated time required for repair.
     6.3.6. Position necessary equipment and personnel when advised by Control Tower of a proposed
     non-emergency cable engagement.
     6.3.7. Provide the operational status of arresting systems using the terms “Operational” or
     “Non-Operational” following aircraft certifications and “In service” and “Out of service” for
     long-term malfunctions and repair.

6.4. Fire Department Responsibilities. Upon notification from the Control Tower, the Fire Department
will respond and perform duties as outlined herein. Firefighters performing tasks at a cable will be in con-
stant radio contact with the Control Tower and be prepared to clear the RWY without delay.
     6.4.1. Inspect the cable prior to aircraft engagement, time and circumstances permitting, and notify
     the Power Production standby person.
     6.4.2. Assume the OSC duties until the cable is reset or removed from the RWY or until the 4 MSG/
     CC assumes command.
     6.4.3. Upon arrival at the scene, check for the presence of fire or potential fire hazards. If actual fire
     or a fire hazard exists, delay further recovery actions until the fire hazards are neutralized.
     6.4.4. Ensure all visual signs are given by Fire Department personnel stationed at the 11 o'clock posi-
     tion of the aircraft. Visual signs will be IAW paragraph 6.5. of this instruction.
     6.4.5. Proceed with the rewinding of the arresting systems as soon as the cable is free from the tail
     hook. If the arresting cable cannot be reset within 15 minutes after aircraft disengagement from the
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                       71


   arresting system, or at the direction of the OSC, remove the cable from the RWY. Coordinate this
   action through Airfield Management, the Control Tower and with the SOF.
   6.4.6. Inspect and reset cable after an aircraft engagement.
   6.4.7. Ensure that Power Production personnel with an AF Form 483 (Certificate of Competency) are
   available to certify the system prior to use. If Power Production personnel are delayed, continue with
   the rewind and note any damage. Notify the Tower that the system has been reset but is waiting to be
   certified by Power Production personnel. Power Production personnel will coordinate with the Tower
   and Fire Protection personnel upon arrival to inspect the system for certification.
   6.4.8. The following criteria are used in determining when an arresting system tape or cable requires
   replacement:
       6.4.8.1. Aircraft weight and speed at time of engagement causing a regime 4 on the nylon tapes.
       6.4.8.2. Any cut into the longitudinal fibers of the nylon tape that cannot be cropped off safely.
       6.4.8.3. Five or more broken wires within one rope lay of the cable.
       6.4.8.4. Nine or more broken wires over the entire length of the cable.
       6.4.8.5. Sharp kinks that cannot be removed by pre-tensioning.
       6.4.8.6. Must be replaced anytime the aircraft speed exceeds 180 knots at time of arrestment.
   6.4.9. In order to preclude unnecessary resetting of the arresting system after engagement, the above
   mentioned information is required by the 4th Civil Engineering Squadron, Power Production shop.
   Therefore, prior to resetting the arresting system, aircraft weight and speed will be relayed to 4th Civil
   Engineering Squadron, Service Call Section immediately following each engagement by the most
   expeditious means of communication. Individual responsibility for relaying this information will be:
       6.4.9.1. Power Production.
       6.4.9.2. The SOF.
       6.4.9.3. OSC or SFO (in the absence of a SOF).
       6.4.9.4. Airfield Management.

6.5. Arresting System Signals. After coming to a stop in the arresting system, the following hand sig-
nals will be used by the director, who will be standing on the RWY at the 11 o'clock position of the air-
craft. Wands will be used at night.
   6.5.1. COME FORWARD: Normal beckoning motion of the hands. Director wants all tape pulled out
   of the arresting system.
   6.5.2. STOP: Arms repeatedly crossed above head with rapid arm movement related to the urgency of
   the stop.
   6.5.3. ROLL BACK: Hands hanging down, palms open, motioning backwards. Let tape tension pull
   aircraft backwards.
   6.5.4. HOOK UP: Extended thumb motioning up into the palm of other hand. If hook does not come
   free of cable, you will have to accomplish items as directed to disengage hook.

     6.5.5. PASS DOWN THE RWY: Both hands pointed forward down the RWY. If too much power is
     used, the cable will roll along the RWY and be damaged.

6.6. Use of Aircraft for Arresting System Training. Practice engagements by landing 4 FW aircraft
are not authorized. If it is necessary to use a taxiing 4 FW aircraft for arrestment gear training and ground
engagement, or certification engagements, barrier certifications will be done at the speed recommended
by AFI 11-2F-15EV3, SJAFB Supplement 1 and arresting cable Technical Order 35E8-2-1-10.

                              HANDLING OF TRANSIENT AIRCRAFT

7.1. Responsibilities. The 4th Operations Group Commander, through the Airfield Manager, is responsi-
ble for coordination of base agencies and activities to ensure proper handling of transient aircraft and ren-
dering the most courteous assistance possible to transient aircrew members.

7.2. Prior Permission Required (PPR). The purpose of being PPR is to manage (not normally restrict)
aircraft operations. All transients must obtain a PPR number to land at SJAFB. PPR numbers will not nor-
mally be issued earlier than 10 days prior to arrival and are required to be obtained no later than 24 hours
prior to arrival. Requests for PPR's in advance of 10 days prior require Airfield Manager approval.
Requests for PPR's for the same day will not be turned down unless servicing (parking, TA, hours of oper-
ations, etc.) is not available. PPR's are not required for aircraft that wish to do pattern work, only aircraft
that land. PPR's are not required for Distinguished Visitors (DVs), Special Air Missions (SAM) and Aire-
vac/Medevac missions. Contact Airfield Management Operations at 722-4097 to request the PPR.
NOTE: 4 FW/CC or 4 OG/CC may authorize OBO or PPR restrictions that do not exceed 6 months. All
other OBO/PPR restrictions must be approved by HQ ACC/A3.

7.3. Transient Procedures. The Airfield Manager will establish necessary procedures to notify all inter-
ested agencies of the estimated time of arrival (ETA) at Seymour Johnson of all transient aircraft, to
include Air Evac, SAM, NAOC, TACAMO, AWACS and divert aircraft.
   7.3.1. The AM dispatcher will, when applicable, notify the Control Tower, Transient Maintenance,
   and Transportation of inbound aircraft. Depending on the type of aircraft, he/she will notify additional
   agencies. Minimum guidelines are:
       7.3.1.1. Air Evac arrivals: Notify the Clinic and Fire Dept of the aircraft type, ETA/ETD, # litter
       on/litter off, and # ambulatory on/offload. Update agencies when aircraft has reached 10 flying
       miles from the RWY.
       7.3.1.2. Accomplish checklists for DV, dangerous cargo, NAOC and TACAMO.
       7.3.1.3. Notify Transient Maintenance to coordinate transient parking availability and whenever
       an aircrew proposes to start engines or indicates a proposed takeoff time.
       7.3.1.4. Pass appropriate arrival/departure times to 4 FW Command Post.
   7.3.2. The Control Tower will:
       7.3.2.1. Inform AM Ops of all inbound transients NLT 10 flying miles from the RWY.
       7.3.2.2. Advise aircrew to contact AM Ops, if needed, via PTD (UHF 372.2) to pass load mes-
       sages, etc.

7.4. Pilot to Dispatcher (PTD) Frequency. Any aircraft needing to contact the AM Operations Dis-
patcher on PTD should do so on frequency 372.2.

7.5. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Aircraft: IAW AFI 13-203, Para 4.6.3.2., Relaying distinguished visi-
tor (DV) information is necessary for military protocol. An ATC facility with direct landline capability
74                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


may relay DV information to a single agency (AM Ops or command post). The ATC facility notifies the
agency only once. This duty is secondary to providing ATC services. The following local responsibilities
apply:
     7.5.1. DV Inbound:
        7.5.1.1. Upon notification of an known inbound DV aircraft, AM Ops will call concerned agen-
        cies immediately.
        7.5.1.2. For an unannounced DV, AM Ops or RAPCON will call Command Post (CP) as soon as
        they receive an inbound flight plan or flight strip. CP will pass the information to the appropriate
        agencies.
        7.5.1.3. RAPCON will call AM Ops upon initial contact with the aircraft and relay call sign, DV
        code and current position. AM Ops will call CP and pass the information verbatim.
        7.5.1.4. CP will notify all appropriate agencies following the initial call from AM Ops.
        7.5.1.5. All follow-on inquiries as to aircraft position must be made to AM Ops and not an ATC
        facility. Repeated phone calls to an ATC facility may cause interference with the safe control of
        aircraft. AM Ops is the only agency permitted to call directly to the RAPCON or the Control
        Tower for DV aircraft position updates.
        7.5.1.6. AM Ops will make a position update request approximately 10 minutes following the ini-
        tial call and relay the position update to the CP for dissemination to applicable base agencies.
     7.5.2. DV Departure Notification: Tower will immediately pass the DV take-off time to AM Ops for
     transfer to CP for relay to appropriate agencies.
     7.5.3. CP serves as the single point of contact for all DV inbound notifications.

7.6. Unscheduled Aircraft Landing. Military aircraft landing at Seymour Johnson without prior
approval or coordination are considered unscheduled. Civilian aircraft are not authorized to land without
Civil Aircraft Landing Permit IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and prior approval from
the Airfield Manager. After hours unscheduled arrivals will be coordinated IAW paragraph 1.5. of this
instruction. The following procedures apply:
     7.6.1. Civil Aircraft:
        7.6.1.1. AM Ops will:
            7.6.1.1.1. Immediately notify the AOF/CC and the Airfield Manager.
            7.6.1.1.2. Try to obtain the callsign, departure location, landing permit number and expiration
            date (if civil aircraft) from the Command Post, Air Traffic Control, or Washington Center.
            7.6.1.1.3. If above agencies cannot confirm aircraft origin after landing, activate the Second-
            ary Crash Net.
            7.6.1.1.4. As directed by the 4 FW/CC or 4 OG/CC obtain clearance from the Control Tower
            to park the aircraft with escort from 4 SFS. Passengers, if any, will remain at the aircraft.
            7.6.1.1.5. Notify Washington Center Military Liaison.
            7.6.1.1.6. Conduct an airfield check to ensure safe airfield operations may be conducted fol-
            lowing the unscheduled arrival.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                  75


     7.6.1.2. RAPCON will:
         7.6.1.2.1. Notify AM Ops immediately of a pending unscheduled aircraft landing.
     7.6.1.3. Control Tower will:
         7.6.1.3.1. Notify AM Ops immediately of a pending unscheduled aircraft landing unless pre-
         viously identified by the RAPCON.
         7.6.1.3.2. If landing is unauthorized, activate the Primary Crash Alert System (PCAS) and
         treat the landing as an emergency situation.
  7.6.2. Military Aircraft
     7.6.2.1. Military aircraft are authorized to land at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. 4 OG/CC
     must approve PPR and Official Business Only (OBO) transient operations. If a military aircraft
     lands without an approval, and not in emergency condition, the following procedures apply:
         7.6.2.1.1. RAPCON will:
             7.6.2.1.1.1. Notify AM Ops immediately upon recognition of an unscheduled aircraft
             arrival.
         7.6.2.1.2. Control Tower will:
             7.6.2.1.2.1. Notify AM Ops as quickly as possible prior to immediately after landing.
         7.6.2.1.3. AM Ops will:
             7.6.2.1.3.1. Notify 4 OSS/OSA and the Airfield Manager.
             7.6.2.1.3.2. Notify TA to coordinate aircraft parking location.
             7.6.2.1.3.3. Perform a runway check immediately following landing to ensure the runway
             is safe to continue operations.
             7.6.2.1.3.4. Make immediate contact with the pilot to determine the circumstances sur-
             rounding the unscheduled landing. Report results to 4 OSS/OSA for forwarding to 4 OG/
             CC.

                                   AIRFIELD LIGHTING SYSTEMS

8.1. Lighting Systems. Seymour Johnson has seven airfield lighting systems.
     8.1.1. RWY lights:
        8.1.1.1. High Intensity RWY Lights (HIRLS) are white and are located on both sides of the RWY
        not more than 10’ from the edge of the full strength pavement. The last 2000’ on an instrument
        RWY are colored yellow.
        8.1.1.2. RWY End Lights define the end of the operational RWY surface for aircraft take-off,
        landing or roll-out. They consist of unidirectional red lights on one side, green on the other.
     8.1.2. Approach lights: ALSF-1 consists of threshold lights, a pre-threshold bar, a terminating bar, a
     300 meter (1000’) cross bar, 2100' of elevated approach lighting extending beyond end of runway and
     sequence flashing lights.
     8.1.3. SFLs: Sequenced Flashing Lights are operated in conjunction with the ALSF-1 and flash in
     sequence to direct the aircraft towards the RWY.
     8.1.4. RWY Distance Remaining Markers: White numeral inscription on black background installed
     along both sides of the RWY. The number on the signs indicates the distance (in thousands of feet) of
     landing RWY remaining.
     8.1.5. PAPIs: The Precision Approach Path Indicators are installed in a single row of four light units
     used on final for VFR approaches on both sides of runway.
     8.1.6. TWY Lights: TWY edge lights define the lateral limits of aircraft taxi routes and are installed
     for use as needed during instrument and night VFR operations. TWY edge lights are omni-directional
     and emit aviation blue light.
     8.1.7. Airfield Rotating Beacon: Rotating light alternating green and two quick white flashes signify-
     ing a military airport.
     8.1.8. Arresting Gear: Arresting Gear markings (AGMs) identify location of BAK-12 cables on the
     operational RWY surface. They are a translucent yellow circle approximately 3.5’ in diameter facing
     both RWY directions.

8.2. Operations. Operation of the RWY lights, ALSF-1, SFLs, PAPIs, distance remaining markers,
TWY lights, and rotating beacon will be as specified in AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, and FAAO
7110.65, Air Traffic Control, or as requested by the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) or Aircraft Commander.
Approach lights will remain at the requested level until another request is made or the visibility restric-
tions are eliminated. PAPIs will be turned on whenever the RWY is in use.

8.3. Alternate Procedures. Whenever the Control Tower is closed or evacuated, AM ops will contact
Civil Engineering Airfield Lighting (or Fire Department as appropriate) and advise them to proceed to the
airfield lighting vault to control the airfield lights. CE (or Fire Department) will operate the airfield light-
ing system as directed by an Air Traffic Controller/Tower personnel (or Airfield Management personnel
if Tower controllers are not available) over the FM radio or commercial telephone.

8.4. Maintenance:
   8.4.1. Civil Engineering Electric Shop will:
       8.4.1.1. Inspect the airfield lighting system at start of the normal duty day. Pick up a copy of the
       AM Ops Airfield Lighting Inspection Sheet prior to proceeding out on the airfield.
       8.4.1.2. Inform AM Ops and Tower of lighting inspection results/discrepancies and any correc-
       tions made on any portion of the airfield lighting system. Brief AM Ops on any discrepancies that
       could not be corrected and provide an estimated time of completion (ETC).
   8.4.2. AM Ops will:
       8.4.2.1. Conduct daily inspection(s) of the airfield lighting system.
       8.4.2.2. Immediately report discrepancies to Civil Engineering Customer Service if the outage
       impacts the flying mission. Otherwise, send the outage list to Airfield Lighting every evening.
       8.4.2.3. Request emergency service on any airfield lighting system that might affect flight safety/
       operations. As dictated by AFJMAN 11-208, Department of Defense Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
       System, send a NOTAM or Airfield Advisory until the equipment is fixed.

8.5. Inoperative Approach Lighting Systems (ALS) Landing Minimums. AM Ops will determine
the status of the approach lighting systems and the precision approach RWY markings. If approach lights
are not in satisfactory condition or the RWY markings are not clearly visible, AM Ops shall advise RAP-
CON and Tower that no-light approach minimums are in effect and transmit a NOTAM.

                                  NOISE ABATEMENT PROGRAM

9.1. Quiet Hours Policy. This instruction outlines procedures taken by all flying organizations and tran-
sient aircraft at SJAFB. 4 OG/CC has directed no takeoffs, landings or ground engine runs above idle
between 2230 and 0600 local, except as approved by the 4 FW Commander or a designated representative
on a case-by-case basis.

9.2. Applicability. Flight operations involving NAOC, TACAMO, JCS exercises, actual deployments,
active air defense activities, scheduled night flying and periodic night exercises (ORI/ORE, etc.) are not
restricted or inhibited by quiet hour restrictions. In addition, engine runs conducted in the hush house do
not require prior approval during quiet hours.

9.3. Responsibilities:
     9.3.1. Only the 4 FW Commander or representative may grant waivers to the Quiet Hour Policy.
     9.3.2. The 4 FW Command Post is the point of contact for waiver requests.

9.4. Noise Complaints. 4 OSS/OSOR (722-3508) is the 4 FW OPR for investigating noise complaints
received from all sources. To the maximum extent possible, refer callers to 4 OSS/OSOR during normal
duty hours, and to 4 FW/CP at all other times.

9.5. Requests to Establish Temporary Quiet Hours. Organizations desiring temporary quiet hours for
changes of command or other ceremonies should submit their request to Wing Scheduling (4 OSS/OSO).
4 OSS/OSO will ensure Airfield Management Operations and the 4 OSS/OSA (Airfield Operations
Flight) is informed of the event after the 4 OG/CC has approved the quiet hours. AM Ops will ensure a
NOTAM is issued covering the quiet hours period.

                 INVESTIGATING EMERGENCY LOCATOR BEACON SIGNALS

11.1. General:
     11.1.1. An Emergency Locator Beacon (ELB) is any emergency transmitter that transmits a modu-
     lated tone on 243.0 Ultra High Frequency (UHF). These include Personnel Locator Beacons (PLB),
     Crash Position Indicators (CPI), and Emergency Locator Transmitters(ELT).
     11.1.2. The operation of aircraft with ELBs installed in parachutes, survival kits, and air foils occa-
     sionally results in inadvertent activations. When inadvertent activations occur, it is essential that pro-
     cedures for search and termination of these ELBs be implemented quickly. This will prevent GUARD
     frequency saturation, which results in loss of the primary emergency frequency and complicates air-
     field operations during valid emergencies.
     11.1.3. It is extremely important that all agencies responsible for search of activated ELBs be notified
     immediately upon detection of an activated ELB.

11.2. Procedures. The process of notification, search and reporting of activated beacons will be as
described below:
NOTE: For ATC purposes PLBs, ELTs, and CPIs will be referred to as ELBs.
     11.2.1. Units monitoring UHF guard frequency will notify 4 FW Command Post to initiate a search
     whenever an ELB activation occurs that is in excess of six seconds duration. All Life Support and
     Maintenance personnel involved in maintenance of ELBs or in movement of equipment containing
     ELBs, will have an operating UHF receiver and monitor 243.0 during the performance of required
     tasks. The purpose of this procedure is to provide immediate detection of an accidentally activated
     ELB. Notification procedures should not be initiated for transmission of six seconds duration or less.
     These activations occasionally occur due to required performance test of aircraft installed ELBs.
     11.2.2. During hours of normal flying operations, the 4 FW Command Post will initiate and monitor
     all inadvertent beacon searches using procedures listed below:
        11.2.2.1. Unit receiving activated ELB signal notifies 4 FW Command Post.
        11.2.2.2. 4 FW Command Post shall notify 4 FW Safety Office and 4 FW Maintenance Opera-
        tions Center to initiate search for inadvertently activated ELB.
        11.2.2.3. Support Section (the Egress Shop and the Parachute Shop), who shall in turn conduct a
        search of their prospective sections, using available receiver detectors.
        11.2.2.4. The standby Life Support Section shall conduct a search of the flightline area.
        11.2.2.5. Once the activated ELB has been located, it will be turned off. KC-135 Life Support
        Technicians shall be responsible for turning off any ELB located in the KC-135 area, while F-15E
        Life Support or Egress will be responsible for turning off any ELB located in the F-15E area.
        11.2.2.6. If the technicians find the area of aircraft inaccessible or if the equipment is unfamiliar
        to them, they shall contact the appropriate Life Support Section or aircrewthrough the 4 FW Com-
        mand Post to have the ELB turned off.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     81


     11.2.2.7. The person deactivating the ELB shall report the location, type, and time the ELB was
     turned off to the 4 FW Command Post, who will log the information and terminate the search.
  11.2.3. After hours of normal flying operations, the 4 FW Command Post shall initiate and monitor
  any inadvertent beacon searches using procedures listed below:
     11.2.3.1. Unit receiving activated ELB signal notifies 4 FW Command Post.
     11.2.3.2. 4 FW Command Post shall notify 4 FW Maintenance Operations Center to initiate
     search for ELB.
     11.2.3.3. The Maintenance Operations Center shall contact the Life Support standby technician
     and the Egress Shop.
     11.2.3.4. The Egress Shop shall initiate a search of their section and maintenance vehicles for the
     ELB.
     11.2.3.5. The life support standby technician will be responsible for initiating an ELB search of
     the flightline area.

                                                Chapter 17

                                AIRFIELD FACILITY EVACUATION

17.1. Purpose. To establish procedures and define responsibilities to ensure continuation of ATC ser-
vices in the event service cannot be provided from the primary facility.

17.2. General. Under certain severe weather conditions, bomb threats, or other situations, as deemed
necessary, SJAFB Tower and RAPCON facility operations may be terminated and all personnel evacu-
ated. Commander and staff functions responsible for launch, evacuation, and recovery of aircraft at
SJAFB should be aware of procedures established for these contingencies and consider possible impact
upon unilateral planning.

17.3. Bomb Threats. Due to close proximity of the Control Tower and RAPCON facilities, when one
facility is threatened it will also affect the other facility.

17.4. High Winds:
     17.4.1. The Control Tower will be evacuated at the discretion of the Watch Supervisor or Senior Con-
     troller on duty any time the wind velocity exceeds, or is forecast to exceed, 75 knots (max wind limi-
     tation of the Tower). Airport advisory service will be provided by the RAPCON if equipment permits.
     This service will include preferred RWY (RWY in use prior to Tower evacuation), wind, altimeter,
     known traffic, and pertinent airfield advisories.
     17.4.2. Tower personnel shall resume normal operations from the Control Tower when the wind
     velocity drops to less than, and is forecast to remain at less than 50 knots.
     17.4.3. The RAPCON Watch Supervisor will notify the 4 CS Maintenance Control if winds of 52
     knots or more are forecast within 12 hours, so that Radar Maintenance may freewheel the ASR
     antenna IAW with the ATC/Maintenance Operations Letter. Radar Maintenance will call RAPCON
     for release of the antenna before freewheeling begins. The ASR is considered mission essential equip-
     ment and must be restored to operational capability as soon as possible.

17.5. Other. All reasons for evacuation of ATC facilities cannot possibly be listed here. Common sense
and good judgment must prevail.

17.6. ATC Facility Evacuation Responsibilities:
     17.6.1. RAPCON:
        17.6.1.1. When RAPCON evacuation is deemed necessary by the Watch Supervisor, Senior Con-
        troller, or other official, approach control service will be terminated by the RAPCON. The
        approach control airspace will be released to Washington ARTCC who will assume approach con-
        trol responsibility IAW current letter of agreement.
        17.6.1.2. When it becomes necessary to evacuate the facilities, the Watch Supervisor or Senior
        Controller shall ensure the facility evacuation checklists are accomplished and direct personnel to
        Airfield Management.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                     95


       17.6.1.3. Prior to evacuating, the RAPCON shall hand off all IFR aircraft under their control to
       Washington ARTCC and make the following broadcast 2 times on all available frequencies:
       "ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE SEYMOUR JOHNSON AREA, SEYMOUR
       JOHNSON APPROACH CONTROL IS EVACUATING AND WILL BE OFF THE AIR UNTIL
       FURTHER ADVISED. CONTACT WASHINGTON CENTER (FREQ) FOR AIR TRAFFIC
       SERVICE."
   17.6.2. Tower:
       17.6.2.1. When it becomes necessary to evacuate the Control Tower, the Watch Supervisor or
       Senior Controller shall ensure the facility evacuation checklists are completed.
       17.6.2.2. Prior to evacuating, if feasible, make the following broadcast 2 times on all available
       frequencies: "ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE SEYMOUR JOHNSON AREA, SEY-
       MOUR JOHNSON TOWER IS EVACUATING AND WILL BE OFF THE AIR UNTIL FUR-
       THER ADVISED. CONTACT SEYMOUR JOHNSON APPROACH FOR AIRPORT
       ADVISORIES."
NOTE: If time and equipment allows include a statement on the ATIS.
       17.6.2.3. Instruct all vehicles to exit the RWY.
       17.6.2.4. Time permitting, activate the primary crash phone to inform receiving agencies that
       Tower is being evacuated (include reason).
       17.6.2.5. The Watch Supervisor will direct evacuating tower personnel to report to the RAPCON
       or AM based on the reason for evacuation. All controllers will remain at the designated evacuation
       site until accountability is assured and await further instructions from ATC management.
   17.6.3. Airfield Management Operations:
       17.6.3.1. When notified by Tower or RAPCON of the evacuation of the facility, initiate NOTAM
       action.
       17.6.3.2. Activate secondary crash net when Tower is evacuated.
   17.6.4. Command Post:
       17.6.4.1. Advise all base flying organizations the Control Tower is out of service and that the pro-
       visions of this chapter are in effect immediately.

17.7. Airfield Management Operations Evacuation. When necessary, Airfield Management will evac-
uate to the RAPCON, Building 4750.
   17.7.1. Time permitting, the AM dispatcher will contact Raleigh Flight Service and Washington Cen-
   ter and activate the secondary crash phone notifying agencies of the evacuation location.
   17.7.2. Personnel evacuating will take the evacuation kit, stereo flight plan book, quick reaction
   checklists, operations instructions, NOTAM book, all hand held radios with chargers, flight/PPR log
   and local flying schedule with them in the Ops 1 vehicle to the RAPCON.

17.8. Exercises/Simulated Force Protection Conditions:
   17.8.1. IAW AFI 13-203 wing officials must brief the AOF/CC at least 48 hours in advance of exer-
   cises that involve any ATC facility or the airport controlled movement area (CMA). The AOF/CC
96                                                      SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


     must approve, in advance, exercises that include removing controllers and airfield management per-
     sonnel to shelter areas.
     17.8.2. The WS/SC must ensure ATC facility participation does not degrade services. WS/SC may
     interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any exercise if flight safety is in question or it inter-
     feres with the recovery of emergency aircraft. Air Traffic Controllers must not wear a gas mask during
     facility operations while under simulated threat conditions. The WS/SC will determine which posi-
     tions are designated as exercise participants.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                                          97


                                                 Chapter 18

                                        AIRFIELD INSPECTIONS

18.1. Purpose. To establish standard procedures for the conduct of airfield inspections and maintenance
of airfield facilities. This chapter assigns responsibilities and establishes a schedule for inspection and fol-
low-up action to ensure plans for correcting identified deficiencies are developed. It applies to all person-
nel responsible for maintenance of airfield facilities.

18.2. Responsibilities:
   18.2.1. The Airfield Manager is responsible to ensure:
       18.2.1.1. Daily airfield inspections are conducted IAW AFI 13-213.
       18.2.1.2. Additional checks are accomplished following severe weather (high winds, heavy rains,
       etc.), upon any report of a dropped object or bird strike on the airfield, after all IFEs unless waived
       by the SOF, after any ground emergency that may affect the airfield, and as needed or requested by
       Tower or the SOF. Airfield checks must be accomplished at least every 4 hours.
   18.2.2. The Base Civil Engineer is responsible to ensure:
       18.2.2.1. Representatives from Engineering, and Pavements and Construction Equipment will
       accompany the Airfield Management representative on quarterly airfield inspections.
       18.2.2.2. Airfield maintenance (i.e. sweeper operations, grass mowers, etc) will operate in accor-
       dance with appropriate flightline driving/BASH/airfield regulations.

18.3. Procedures:
   18.3.1. The daily airfield inspection will be conducted as soon as possible after the start of the duty
   day. Special attention will be given to the following areas:
       18.3.1.1. Condition of RWY, TWYs and aprons.
       18.3.1.2. Condition of overrun areas.
       18.3.1.3. General condition and operational status of aircraft arresting systems.
       18.3.1.4. All aprons, TWYs, and the RWY for debris or other material that constitutes a hazard to
       aircraft movement.
       18.3.1.5. General condition of the airfield.
       18.3.1.6. Airfield markings, signage and lighting.
       18.3.1.7. Access road and airfield traffic compliance with traffic rules.
   18.3.2. Quarterly airfield joint inspections will include the Airfield Manager, Airfield Operations
   Flight Commander, TERPS liaison, FOD Manager, Safety (Flight and Ground), Tower Chief, SOF
   representative, SFS representative, and Civil Engineering (waivers/pavements).
   18.3.3. All hazards and discrepancies noted during inspections will be recorded in detail to include
   type of discrepancy and location. General condition of the lighting system will be noted and previ-
98                                                    SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007


     ously identified discrepancies that have not been corrected will be documented. Airfield Management
     will arrange for photographic documentation if necessary.
     18.3.4. During all inspections, emphasis will be placed on obstacles which might constitute hazards
     to operations.
     18.3.5. Dispatcher will notify the Airfield Manager when a reported discrepancy is a hazard that
     requires immediate corrective action.
     18.3.6. The Airfield Manager or Designated Representative will:
        18.3.6.1. Ensure the appropriate report is made to the agency responsible for corrective actions (4
        CES, 4 CS, etc.).
        18.3.6.2. All emergency deficiencies noted on all inspections will be handled by service call. All
        others will be handled on AF Form 332, CE Work Request.

18.4. RWY Surface Condition (RSC) and RWY Condition Reading (RCR) Values:
     18.4.1. Conditions will be checked and reported during inclement weather when weather conditions
     change, the snow removal status of an area changes or when requested.
        18.4.1.1. Reported as a two-digit number from 01 (worst) to 26 (best). Use "RCRNR" when no
        RSC/RCR information is available.
        18.4.1.2. Minimum number of readings: Two RCRs will be taken on the approach and the depar-
        ture end each (first and last 1,000’), either side of the centerline with the emphasis on entering and
        exiting the RWY. RCR will be taken every 1,000’ on the remaining RWY.
     18.4.2. Reporting RSC. When water is the only form of moisture on the RWY, AM Ops will report the
     RSC as "Wet RWY", not reporting a RCR. Joint USAF/NASA tests have proven RCR measurements
     invalid where the only form of moisture affecting the RWY is water.
        18.4.2.1. WR = Wet RWY. There is discernible moisture (water pooling) on the RWY. Report
        water to nearest 1/10 inch.
NOTE: Seymour Johnson’s RWY is grooved; therefore, visible pooling must be present to negatively
affect aircraft braking action.
        18.4.2.2. SLR = Slush on RWY. There is slush, but no ice or snow on RWY. Do not report an
        RCR.
        18.4.2.3. IR / LSR / PSR = Ice / Loose Snow / Packed Snow on RWY. Determine RCR using
        decelerometer.
        18.4.2.4. Water or Slush and Ice on RWY. When an ice-covered RWY also has water or slush on
        it, report the predominant RSC. Determine the computed RCR or use the value of 12, whichever is
        lower.
        18.4.2.5. P/Wet or P/Dry = Patchy conditions; RWY partially covered with ice or snow, and the
        rest is wet or dry.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI11-250 7 MAY 2007                                                          99


  18.4.3. TWYs, Hammerheads and Aprons. Determine the overall RSC and RCR that best describe the
  condition of the total area listed.

services such as fueling, passenger drop off or pickup, practice approaches, parking, etc. Aircraft
(including civilian) may use the airfield for official government business if they obtain prior permission
from Airfield Management.
Prior Permission Required (PPR)—All transient aircraft must receive permission from Airfield
Management to land at Seymour Johnson AFB before leaving their departure airport. PPR does not apply
to practice approaches, except for civilian aircraft. Civilian aircraft may only make low approaches to the
RWY at Seymour Johnson.
NOTE: OBO/PPR does not apply to inflight emergencies, Code 6 (O-7) or higher DVs, or weather divert
aircraft.
