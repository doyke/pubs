MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
               MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: HQ USAF/HC
      1380 Air Force Pentagon, Room 4E260
      Washington, DC 20330-1380

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 52-105V2, Chapel Tithes and Offering
         Fund (CTOF)

        By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately
implements changes to AFI 52-105V2, Chapel Tithes and Offering Fund (CTOF) and the
descriptions of indirect mission requirements and explains CTOF-paid honoraria. Compliance
with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air
Force publications, the information herein prevails in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications
and Forms Management.

       The changes are as follows:

       1.1.1. The Air Force Chaplain Corps provides spiritual care and ensures all Airmen have
       opportunities to exercise their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.
       Activities that directly support the Air Force mission are called direct mission
       requirements, are funded with appropriated funds (see Table 1.) and reflect the Air Force
       Chaplain Corps’ Strategic Plan. Activities that indirectly support the Air Force mission
       are called Indirect Mission Requirements and are funded with CTOF. CTOF will not be
       used to augment or supplement appropriated funds for direct mission requirements; doing
       so may result in a violation of the Antideficiency Act (see Air Force Guidance
       Memorandum to AFI 52-105V1, Chaplain Service Resourcing, Appropriated Funds,
       Table 1).

       2.2.6. Honoraria. Honoraria are payments for services that are rendered nominally
       without charge. CTOF may pay honoraria for chapel-sponsored events that are,
       themselves, funded with CTOF or other sources of nonappropriated funds as an indirect
       mission requirement and will not be made on a recurring basis to the same person or
       organization. Honoraria will not be used to pay government employees for services
       rendered by a contract or for duties associated with the contract.

       2.2.6.1. Honoraria will not be paid to a potential contractor during the solicitation or
       evaluation phases of a procurement.
2.2.6.2. When determining the appropriate approval levels (see below) for CTOF-funded
honoraria, only the actual amount of the CTOF-funded honorarium, excluding per diem
and travel expenses, will constitute the cost against which the threshold is applied. Use
the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) as a guideline to determine travel and per
diem limits.

              Approval Authority                    Dollar Range
              Wing Chaplain or Equivalent           $500 or less
              MAJCOM/HC or Designee                 $2,000 or less
              AF/HC or Designee                     More than $2,000

2.2.6.3. Submit a fully completed AF Form 4356 to the Chaplain Corps Accounting
Center (CCAC) for processing.

2.2.6.4. Honoraria recipients must acknowledge receipt of payment by signing AF Form
4361, Chapel Tithes and Offering Fund (CTOF) Receipt at the time of payment. The
account manager will forward the completed receipt to the CCAC within one duty day
after the AF Form 4361 is signed.

                                           Chapter 1

                              CHAPLAIN SERVICE FUNDING

1.1. Chaplain Service Resourcing: The process of securing supplies, equipment, and services
to meet direct and indirect mission requirements. Wing commanders in consultation with the
wing chaplain may designate a specified ministry requirement as a direct mission requirement
and resource accordingly.
     1.1.1. Direct mission requirements are funded by appropriated funds. Indirect mission
     requirements are funded by CTOF. Mission requirements are prioritized based on local
     needs assessments. CTOF will not be used to fund direct mission requirements. (See
     direct/non-direct mission requirement table, Attachment 2).
     1.1.2. Commanders are required to provide comprehensive religious support to all
     authorized individuals within their areas of responsibility.
     1.1.3. Programs will be prioritized by availability of resources and mission impact. Funds
     will not obligated/spend beyond the balance of cash-on-hand.
     1.1.4. Music for religious services (one musician & one music director) is a direct mission
     requirement and will be funded by appropriated funds. Additional music requirements for
     religious services may be funded using CTOF to fund non-personal service contract
     personnel. (See direct/non-direct mission requirement table, Attachment 2).
     1.1.5. AFI 52-105, Volume I, Chaplain Service Resourcing, Appropriated Funds, covers
     Appropriated Funds.
        1.1.5.1. Resourcing is based on the chapel program planning cycle which consists of 1)
        conducting need assessments; 2) program development based on assessments; 3)
        developing resource requirements to match program requirements; 4) ministry execution;
        5) and evaluation.
        1.1.5.2. CTOF may be used to purchase equipment items (fixed assets) for chapel
        programs when the purchases are not direct mission requirements. The Wing Chaplain
        identifies and certifies fixed asset purchases by approving CTOF fund requests.
1.2. Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund:
     1.2.1. Purpose and Use. CTOF is cash and other assets received through the free-will
     donations of Air Force religious communities. CTOF is an instrumentality of the United
     States Government and acts in its own name to provide or assist in the delivery of spiritual
     care to Air Force members, their families, and other authorized personnel.
     1.2.2. AF/HC has overall responsibility for CTOF policies and operations. CTOF is
     specifically exempted from MWR oversight in accordance with DoDI 1015.14.,
     Establishment, Management, and Control of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities and
     Financial Management of Supporting Resources.
     1.2.3. CTOF will not be used for reimbursement of Temporary Duty (TDY) or Permissive
     Temporary Duty (PTDY) expenses.
AFI52-105V2 10 September 2007                                                                 5


   1.2.4. Use CTOF to support indirect mission requirements identified in the Wing Level
   Program Planning Cycle.
   1.2.5. Installation CTOF may be used to purchase gifts (not exceeding $20) for individuals
   who have contributed their time and talent to the chapel program. DoD 5500.7-R (Joint
   Ethics Regulation) covers ethical guidelines for giving and receiving gifts. Installation
   CTOF will not be used to purchase:
      1.2.5.1. Food or gifts for retirement or promotion ceremonies.
      1.2.5.2. Gifts for military personnel on TDY or PTDY status.
   1.2.6. Honoraria are allowed and separate from gifts.
1.3. Authorized CTOF. AF/HC, MAJCOM/HC, and Installation/HC are authorized to
establish a CTOF.
   1.3.1. Use AF/HC CTOF to assist religious and humanitarian organizations, provide
   emergency or special grants, or engage in public relations for the Chaplain Service.
   1.3.2. Use MAJCOM CTOF (Special Activities) to disburse AF/HC emergency or special
   grants, execute indirect mission requirements supporting the command, or engage in
   Chaplain Service public relations on behalf of the command. MAJCOM/DRU chaplain
   develops operating procedures for use of their command special activity fund.
   1.3.3. Use installation CTOF to administer chapel authorized disbursements. The Wing
   Chaplain will develop local CTOF operating procedures as a supplement to this AFI.
   Coordinate operating procedures with MAJCOM/HC prior to implementation.
   1.3.4. Do not establish a CTOF at deployed locations; however, the use of CTOF funds is
   authorized.
      1.3.4.1. The senior Air Force chaplain at each deployed location may request a one-time
      grant per rotation. Deployed chapel staffs must exercise sound judgment and stewardship
      in requesting funds to ensure all requested funds can be spent during their AEF rotation.

2.1. CTOF Budget Development and Modifications.
   2.1.1. Budgets are based on the results of local needs assessments.
   2.1.2. Wing Chaplains develop income-based budgets. Approved budgets may not exceed
   the projected income for the current Fiscal Year (FY) and carryover funds. Carryover funds
   are determined by calculating the difference between the checking account balance (plus
   saving accounts balance) and outstanding obligations. Budgets are submitted to the Chaplain
   Service Accounting Centers (CSAC) not later than 1 September.
   2.1.3. Use the USAF Chaplain Service standardized Chart of Accounts for budgeting
   purposes.
   2.1.4. The Wing Chaplain must approve modifications to the annual CTOF budget amount
   in writing. Use one of the following methods:
      2.1.4.1. Multiple Changes. Submit an official memorandum to the CSAC describing the
      budget modifications. File the change document in the CTOF Continuity Binder.
      2.1.4.2. One-time Change. Wing Chaplains authorize the Account Manager to exceed a
      specific budget target by signing the AF Form 4356, CTOF Purchase Request and
      providing comments in the remarks section.
2.2. Purchasing CTOF Supplies and Services.
   2.2.1. Purchase Approval. At a minimum, submit all AF Form 4356s to the Account

   CSAC not later than five duty days prior to the date the money is required for purchase.
   Ensure all information on the AF Form 4356 is accurate and complete.
   2.2.3. Recurring Purchases. In order to eliminate unnecessary paperwork, purchase approval
   is authorized for project officer advances and reimbursements. Submit an AF Form 4356
   annually to the CSAC for recurring monthly purchases. On the AF Form 4356, indicate the
   transaction is for recurring purchases and include the monthly and annual spending limits not
   to exceed the annual budget authority. Additionally, provide a list of the items to be
   purchased on a recurring basis. Any variance from this list requires a new AF Form 4356.
   For recurring reimbursements, the CSAC still requires receipts prior to issuing checks or
   Electronic Funds Transfer (EFTs) for reimbursements. Checks or EFTs will be issued
   automatically for project officer advances each month or as specified on the AF Form 4356
   unless directed otherwise.
   2.2.4. Methods of Purchase.
      2.2.4.1. Check. Checks may be issued directly to an individual or vendor for services or

       commercial vendor within three business days of receipt of the request.
       2.2.4.2. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Electronic payments may be issued directly to
       an individual or vendor bank account to pay for services or supplies rendered. Submit an

       Offerings Fund (CTOF) Electronic Funds Transfer. The CSAC will initiate an EFT
       payment within three duty days of receipt of the request. The AF Form 4360 is only
       required for the first payment for recurring purchases. The CSAC maintains a log of
       active AF Form 4360s for future use. Account Managers should allow at least two
       business days for EFT processing by the bank.
       2.2.4.3. Reimbursement. Individuals may request reimbursement for personal funds used
       to support chapel programs; however, an AF Form 4356 must be approved in advance of
       the purchase being made. Submit an approved AF Form 4356 along with purchase
       receipts to the CSAC for reimbursement. The CSAC will issue a check or EFT within
       three duty days of receipt. No reimbursements will be made by the CSAC without a pre-
       approved AF Form 4356 and purchase receipts. Individuals may be reimbursed for
       purchases made with their personal credit card; however, federal, state, or local taxes will

       to support approved chapel programs. Submit an approved AF Form 4356 to the CSAC

       Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund (CTOF) Project Officer Report, to the Account
       Manager along with purchase receipts not later than 10 days following the conclusion of

       designated offering checks to the recipient if the offering was listed on the approved
       designated offering list. There is no need to submit an AF Form 4356 to initiate the
       transfer of designated offerings unless it was an unscheduled collection. Checks will be
