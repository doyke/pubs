                                               Chapter 1

                                              OVERVIEW

1.1. Philosophy. The Manpower and Organization (M&O) function has four core competencies: (1)
Requirements Determination, (2) Program Allocation and Control, (3) Organizational Structure, and (4)
Performance Management. These four competencies form the basis for all M&O activities. Specifics
regarding the core competencies can be found in their applicable Air Force Instructions (AFIs) as refer-
enced below.
    1.1.1. Requirements Determination. M&O personnel assist Air Force commanders and functional
    managers at all levels in mission accomplishment by objectively quantifying manpower requirements
    for the distribution of Air Force manpower resources. Key services of this competency include peace-
    time manpower standards development, wartime manpower requirements, and competitive sourcing
    and privatization actions. Integral in any manpower requirements determination effort is a review of a
    function’s processes with the goal of making process improvements as described in Chapter 3. Addi-
    tional concepts and performance guidance regarding this competency are provided in AFI 38-203,
    Commercial Activities Program, and AFI 38-205, Manpower and Quality Readiness and Contingency
    Management. Roles and responsibilities are outlined in AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Require-
    ments.
    1.1.2. Manpower Program Allocation and Control. Concepts and performance guidance are provided
    in AFI 38-201; AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support Activi-
    ties; and AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower.
    1.1.3. Organizational Structure. Concepts and performance guidance are provided in
    AFPD 38-1, Organization, and AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization.
    1.1.4. Performance Management. Concepts and performance guidance are provided in AFI 90-1102,
    Performance Management. This competency uses various tools and techniques found in AFMAN
    38-208, Volume 1, Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP ) - Processes; AFMAN
    38-208 Volume 2, Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP) - Quantification Tools; and
    AFI 90-553, Standardizing Action Workout Improvements.

1.2. Purpose of the Management Engineering Program (MEP). The Air Force MEP provides the
foundation for executing all M&O core competencies and helps Air Force commanders and functional
managers improve productivity through the use of performance improvement techniques and procedures.
The MEP provides the framework for developing Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMSs), com-
mand-unique manpower standards, and providing products and services.
    1.2.1. Team Approach. MEP and functional personnel build cohesive teams to reach study objectives
    and achieve productivity improvement goals. Formal study contracts outline specific study objectives
    and responsibilities for all team members to work together to meet those objectives.
    1.2.2. MEP Methodology. MEP methodology is built on state-of-the-art performance improvement
    techniques.
       1.2.2.1. Performance improvement takes a systematic look at an organization to identify pro-

       ment analysis. The project team collects data to analyze and improve these processes to meet
       future requirements. Tools and techniques described in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, are used as
       appropriate for the study.
       1.2.2.2. The Seven-Phase Approach to Requirements Determination studies as described in Sec-
       tion 3B-Section 3G of this volume may be applicable for use in all four core competency contexts
       where improvement in performance is desired.
   1.2.3. MEP Organization.
       1.2.3.1. HQ USAF/XP gives program direction through related policy. The Air Force Manpower
       and Innovation Agency (AFMIA) develops tools and techniques to carry out policy and furnishes
       MEP customer-related technical support.
       1.2.3.2. M&Os at all levels will implement the MEP.

1.3. Scheduling Policy.
   1.3.1. Air Force and major command (MAJCOM) offices of primary responsibility (OPR) will con-
   tinually evaluate their functions to determine the need to update a study. This includes process
   changes, opportunities for process improvement, organization and mission changes, as well as indica-
   tors from Air Force management information systems.
   1.3.2. HQ USAF/XP approves all Air Force-level process oriented review exemptions.
   1.3.3. M&O and functional personnel will partner with the appropriate OPR to accomplish perfor-
   mance improvement projects.
   1.3.4. MAJCOMs perform improvement projects for MAJCOM-unique functions.
   1.3.5. Air Staff functional managers, in partnership with AFMIA, will brief the Air Force Corporate
   Structure on the results of their zero-based reviews to include prioritization of their workloads and
   options for sourcing any unfunded requirement. MAJCOMs will use their own corporate structures
   for their command-unique areas.
   1.3.6. Air Force will retain any savings from the Air Force-wide reviews to source new Air
   Force-wide initiatives as determined through the Air Force Corporate Structure. MAJCOMs will
   retain all savings from their command-unique reviews to use as the MAJCOM Corporate Structure
   deems necessary.
   1.3.7. AFMIA will publish all resultant active duty Air Force and MAJCOM-unique manpower stan-
   dards. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command will continue to publish reserve manpower stan-
   dards. Reference this volume for publishing guidelines.

                         INTRODUCTION TO CONSULTANT SERVICES

2.1. Purpose of Consultant Services. The MEP offers consultant services to unit commanders at all lev-
els of command and to functional managers at headquarters level. Commanders and functional managers
may request consultant services to help solve an existing or potential problem or get general information
or advice about manpower management issues.

2.2. Definition of Consultant Services. Consultant services direct manpower and management engi-
neering expertise toward problem resolution, effective resource usage, or mission performance improve-
ments. These services may include brief consultation with management, or a more in-depth consultation
requiring a study contract and report. Unit commanders at all levels of command and functional managers
at headquarters level may request consultant services. For description of possible tools and techniques
that could be used for a study, reference AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2.

2.3. Consultant Services Requirements.
    2.3.1. Consultant Requirements. There are no specific requirements for brief consultations. However,
    for in-depth studies, the following requirements apply:
       2.3.1.1. The Management Engineer (ME) consultant and client form a study partnership. They
       cooperate in all special study activities to include study planning, data collection, analysis, and
       implementation.
       2.3.1.2. The client has final authority to accept or reject the completed study recommendations.
       2.3.1.3. The ME helps the client with the implementation of recommendations and conducts fol-
       low-up visits to help evaluate results.
       2.3.1.4. The ME is responsible for study confidentiality and may only release study results and
       documents with the client's permission.
       2.3.1.5. The ME must evaluate study feasibility before agreeing to study the function. Consider
       the following when evaluating feasibility:
           2.3.1.5.1. Does the client need assistance to complete the management engineering project?
           Can the study goals and objectives be modified to still aid in process improvement?
           2.3.1.5.2. Can a one-time, economical, and relatively short-term analysis solve a problem? Is
           an objective, impartial viewpoint needed to give a fresh approach to a difficult problem?
           2.3.1.5.3. Has the client tried but cannot define or solve the problem?
           2.3.1.5.4. The ME consultant and client coordinate with the installation labor relations official
           regarding requirements of local collective bargaining agreements when any members repre-
           sented by a union may be impacted by the consulting process or by recommendations of the
           study.
       2.3.1.6. DON'T do a study if the MEP consultant believes the sole purpose is to:
           2.3.1.6.1. Justify predetermined manpower increases or decreases.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              9


         2.3.1.6.2. Expect the consultant to make a line management decision for the client.
  2.3.2. Documentation Requirements. Consultant service products objectively state analysis results
  and help the commander, manager, or supervisor decide alternative courses of action.
     2.3.2.1. Formal reports are not required for brief consultations. Exercise customer-oriented judg-
     ment to decide the effort and detail required to satisfy the client's needs.
     2.3.2.2. An in-depth, formal study may have three written parts:
         2.3.2.2.1. Consultant Study Contract (Figure 2.1.). This written agreement constitutes a study
         contract between the MEP consultant and the client. This contract forms the basis for mutual
         responsibilities and potential follow-on study activities.
         2.3.2.2.2. Consultant Study Final Report (Figure 2.2.). The MEP consultant documents study
         findings in the study final report.
         2.3.2.2.3. Consultant Study Abstract (Figure 2.3.). When approved for distribution by the cli-
         ent, the primary purpose of the study abstract is crosstell (internal benchmarking). Its use is
         based on the potential applicability of identified improvements to other similar sites or func-
         tions. Consider study abstract crosstell to MAJCOM M&Os and functional counterparts, MEP
         administrators, and other pertinent Air Force organizations. If the MEP consultant and client
         decide there’s no applicable potential for other sites or functions, or if the outcome of the spe-
         cial study was converted to an approved manpower standard or variance (see paragraph 3.27.),
         the study abstract isn’t required.

              REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION: SEVEN-PHASE APPROACH

Section 3A—General Concepts.

3.1. General Concepts. The ultimate goal of organizational performance is mission accomplishment.
Resource requirements reflected in a manpower standard should be based on an organization and process
designs which most effectively and efficiently accomplishes the mission. Improving mission effective-
ness while maintaining or improving efficiency should be the goal of any modification to a function’s cur-
rent organizational or process design. Efficiency does not necessarily mean decreasing resources, but
rather improving the return on the resources used.

3.2. Contexts for Using the Seven-Phase Approach. The approach described below is useful in any
context for process improvement. It ensures that an organization is designed effectively and efficiently
before building a manpower standard. For example, the Assessment step in AFI 90-1102 may identify
that an organization is not meeting performance standards. Using the Seven-Phase Approach is a method
an organization can use to identify and improve problem areas and processes that can be incorporated into
the planning portion of the performance management cycle, outlined in AFI 90-1102.

3.3. Seven-Phase Performance Improvement Approach. Improving performance requires both plan-
ning and execution. The Seven-Phase Approach is a guideline designed to be flexible and adaptable to
organizational needs and study scope and not meant to be a restrictive and inflexible checklist. The
approach provides the structure to increase the chance of successful implementation of process improve-
ments. The phases represent fundamental elements to address no matter what scope the performance
improvement effort takes. It should be used as a guide, tailored to fit the scope and intent of the project at
hand. Various tools and techniques to assist in these improvement efforts are listed in AFMAN 38-208,
Volume 2, which may be modified as appropriate for the project requirements. Volume 2 is not all inclu-
sive of the available improvement tools a ME may use.
   3.3.1. The “Five Fronts” to Consider. For organizational change efforts to be effective, they generally
   must include some redesign and/or coordination on five “Fronts” (see Figure 3.1.). These are organi-
   zational areas that interrelate and should be considered. The figure shown illustrates these Fronts. A
   change in one Front may require actions or changes in another Front. For example, changing a process
   may also require some training or retraining (People Front); the process improvement may affect how
   technology is used (Technology Front); or the process design may require updates to regulations (Pol-
   icy, Legislation, Regulation Front).
14                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


Figure 3.1. The Five Fronts.




        3.3.1.1. Organization/People. The human resource asset is the key element for the future viability
        and growth of the organization in a continuously learning environment. As processes are rede-
        signed or other changes are made, a focus should remain on the worker who must be enabled with
        appropriate knowledge, skills, experiences and tools, empowered to learn and act, and rewarded
        based on the organization’s values and measures.
        3.3.1.2. Technology. This crucial enabling factor allows compression of cycle/lead time and dis-
        tance, broader access to information and knowledge assets, and eliminates barriers between cus-
        tomers and suppliers.
        3.3.1.3. Policies, Legislation and Regulations. Changing existing policies, regulations, and legis-
        lation may be required for new processes.
        3.3.1.4. Physical Infrastructure. The physical facilities, equipment and tools should be designed to
        support and maximize changes in workflow, information technology, and human resources.
        3.3.1.5. Process. The flow of work and information into, through, and out of the organization
        must be redesigned, overcoming the constraints of traditional functions or boundaries.
     3.3.2. Spectrum of Performance Improvement. Figure 3.2. illustrates scope of possible improvement
     efforts. Understanding the scope of a project is critical for performing the subsequent project phases.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                             15


Figure 3.2. Spectrum of Performance Improvement Scope.




Locking on to a specific location on the chart, however, is not as important as understanding the unique
issues to consider for each phase of a project being performed. The scope may be adjusted as the project
progresses, requiring new things to be considered and emphasized.

       3.3.2.1. Axes. As the scope of the organization involved (bottom axis) in the improvement effort
       increases from simple issues through activities and sub-processes to the entire organization, so too
       does the impact on the organizational mission (left axis). Typically, increased organizational
       scope is associated with more data collection and analysis as more processes are involved.
       Increased mission impact scope (left axis) is associated with the need for more coordination and
       communication since more separate units and levels may be involved. Of course, each project may
       have unique effort, analysis, and coordination requirements, which need to be considered by the
       project team.
       3.3.2.2. Continuum Line (Wedge). The range of improvement efforts is reflected by a continuum
       versus discreet points in order to reduce the tendency to get overly focused on the semantics of one
16                                                               AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     type of improvement effort over another. For example, “reengineering” is a term which has been
     misused in industry and the government in recent years. Since so many perceptions and inconsis-
     tent definitions exist for this type of improvement effort, having a separate discreet item labeled
     “reengineering” only promotes the problem. A continuum allows one to define the project in a
     flexible manner, based on the desired outcomes, without having to wrestle with confusing or
     restrictive labels.
     3.3.2.3. The spectrum is divided into three ranges (micro, mid-level, and macro) to represent the
     increasing levels of scope and mission impact for improvement projects. Traditional types of
     improvement efforts such as Action Work Outs, Functional Process Improvements, and Reengi-
     neering, etc., may fall into one of these ranges, but exceptions to where such efforts fall may exist,
     based on a project’s requirements. Again, try to avoid labeling a project as one range-type or
     another (the range titles are used in this document to simply assist in describing the approach).
     3.3.2.4. The three ranges are described below, and refer to projects that would fall on the contin-
     uum line. The continuum line is used simply as a central position that aids in describing the
     approach. You will notice that typically, the recommended activities for each range will build on
     one another, from micro to macro. This emphasizes the fact that the fundamental concept of each
     phase is important in any project, but the level of effort associated with the activities (communica-
     tion, coordination, data collection, analysis, etc.) will often increase with scope (represented by
     the wedge on the chart).
        3.3.2.4.1. Micro. These efforts often reflect minor tuning of an activity or process. They can
        be considered almost “surgical” improvement efforts, focused on a very small organizational
        scope. Coordination, communication, and time to accomplish such efforts are typically lower
        than the other ranges. Cost may still be high here, especially if technology changes are
        involved.
        3.3.2.4.2. Mid-level. Typically, more processes are being examined, or the level of detail is
        increased. Data gathering and analysis may also be more important, as the impact on the orga-
        nization becomes more critical. Improvement gains in this type of effort typically have signif-
        icant impact on the mission, but the scope of the improvement may be restricted to a function
        or department.
        3.3.2.4.3. Macro. This represents a more holistic improvement in the organization, often
        focused on dramatic results. The coordination, communication, and time requirements can be
        substantial at this level with a focus on improving processes across functions and typical
        boundaries. Because this type of effort results in profound changes in the organization, the
        need for leadership commitment and a well-defined and communicated compelling case for
        change is paramount in a macro improvement effort.
     3.3.2.5. Case for Change. Across the spectrum of improvement opportunities, a compelling case
     for change remains a constant requirement. Considering the human element that exists at all levels
     and scopes of the organizations, defining and articulating the case for change is a fundamental
     ingredient for successful implementation. The message or case for change should convincingly
     address one or both of the following questions:
        3.3.2.5.1. “What will it get me if I change?” This is a “pull” type of motivation which must
        present something of interest to the target audience. Change is often a scary and painful pro-
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                               17


           cess, whether it is changing familiar work processes, learning a new software program, or quit-
           ting smoking. The change will occur and take hold only if the outcome is truly desired.
           3.3.2.5.2. “What will it cost me if I do not change?” This is often referred to as a “burning
           platform,” providing a convincing “push” argument that staying the same is not a reasonable
           alternative. “Warfighters will start dying,” “Our career field will be outsourced or eliminated,”
           or “You will be fired” are pretty compelling reasons to jump from the platform. Of course, the
           case for change needs to appeal to those in the organization impacted by the effort.
           3.3.2.5.3. Having the answers to these questions articulated early on in the process is critical
           to obtaining buy in and momentum, no matter what the project.
       3.3.2.6. Increase in Scope. As the scope of the improvement effort progresses from smaller to
       larger (on the chart in Figure 3.2.), communication, coordination, level of effort, and often, time
       and project costs also increase, as represented by the wedge.
   3.3.3. Seven-Phase Requirements Determination. The seven phases are Project Definition, Planning,
   As-Is, Opportunity Research, To-Be, Coordination & Approval, and Implementation. Often, several
   phases occur simultaneously, and in some cases, in different orders. However, some phases must pre-
   cede others. For example, Project Definition and Planning must always be in place before Implemen-
   tation occurs. No matter what the scope of the improvement effort, all seven “phases” will be present
   to some degree. Some may happen almost instantaneously, and some phases may be accomplished
   concurrently, but any improvement effort requires each phase to be addressed.
       3.3.3.1. For most functional studies, the focus of the study effort should be in the Opportunity
       Research and To-Be phases. This emphasis on the future helps ensure the study, when completed,
       defines the manpower requirements for the future rather than the past. Although estimating the
       manpower impact of future process changes may be a challenging endeavor, it is the most critical
       part of the study. Not only is this where change opportunities exist, but it provides a future base-
       line requirement for the function under study.
       3.3.3.2. Each phase is addressed in more detail in the following sections.

Section 3B—Project Definition--Phase 1

3.4. General Concepts. Secure commitment from the unit commander or functional manager who is
sponsoring the project. This sponsor should be the one who has the authority to approve changes and
should represent the highest appropriate level in the organization. The project sponsor must be committed
and must articulate why the change must occur, who should participate in the change effort, who will be
affected by the change, and what the change is expected to bring about. This phase answers the questions,
“What are we changing for?” and “What does success look like?” These answers will clarify the project
objectives for all involved in the effort. Scope is also defined in this phase, clarifying what will and will
not be included in this study (e.g., joint resources, particular Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), and tech-
nologies, etc.), and the level of mission focus (Air Force-wide, base level, etc.). Based on the understand-
ing of the scope, the M&O personnel assisting with the effort can determine the project team composition
necessary to best help the organization. The project team should conduct familiarization research on the
organization, gather available data early on in this phase, and may conduct familiarization visits to see
how the organization does its job.
18                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


3.5. Scope Activity Descriptions.
     3.5.1. Micro. Improvement on a focused portion of a local organization may require project definition
     in a very informal manner. For an extreme example, if the project is simply redesigning a three-person
     cubicle, the sponsor may be on a very low level that can authorize cubicle changes. That person must
     still have an idea of why the change is needed and what the objectives of the project are (What should
     improve if the change works?). The scope will be very narrow, but still needs to be understood and
     communicated. Even for a small effort, an unclear project definition can result in wasted effort, frus-
     tration, and possibly no improvement.
     3.5.2. Mid-level. The fundamental questions addressed in the micro scale are still pertinent, but iden-
     tifying the sponsor and clarifying the purpose, scope, and case for change become more challenging.
     In addition to the sponsor, other stakeholders may need to provide their input into defining the project.
     Interviews are useful in collecting this information and understanding limitations/risks to the project.
     Familiarizing sponsors on the Seven-Phase Approach allows them to understand and anticipate the
     effort associated with a project as they currently envision it. A case for change may be formally docu-
     mented to serve as a motivating vehicle for those who will be assigned to work the project. The scope
     associated with a mid-level project may require the M&O consulting team to do some preliminary
     familiarization research on the process or organization. Understanding the language, resources, and
     operations of the organization will prove helpful in facilitating even small groups. Site visits, mission
     directives, current manpower standards, AFIs, Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements,
     unit type codes (UTCs), and web sites are valuable sources of initial information.
     3.5.3. Macro. A macro project generally requires the sponsor to be in a senior-level leadership posi-
     tion (e.g., functional leader). Because this type of project may encompass multiple processes to be
     impacted Air Force-wide, sponsor commitment and a compelling case for change become even more
     critical. The study team’s role is to have the sponsor articulate the case, vision, and objectives and
     agree to be a relentless champion for the effort. If several senior leaders (e.g., for a cross-functional
     project) are involved, a workshop may be an approach to capture this information and address any
     risks or concerns. Educating the sponsor(s) on the Seven-Phase Approach is also necessary as a pre-
     view for the type of effort they are going to sponsor. Due to the large scope and the resources
     involved, developing a plan to minimize or address project risks is also a valuable step in this phase.
     Prior to and following sponsor meeting(s), the M&O team should do familiarization research on the
     organization.

Section 3C—Project Planning--Phase 2

3.6. General Concepts. The extent of the planning will vary by study type, objectives, and functional
complexity. Develop a clear and comprehensive road map to guide the accomplishment of the project.
Establish a plan for how to progress, milestones that must be reached, deliverables that must be created,
and how to communicate critical information. Teams are often formed to perform and review the project
progress. The key participants of such teams must understand what their roles are and how they will need
to participate.

3.7. Planning Considerations.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                19


   3.7.1. Study Objectives. Base objectives on the client’s needs and then determine the type and extent
   of the study to accomplish these objectives. The project team (M&O and client participants) must
   ensure all objectives are realistic and attainable.
   3.7.2. Responsibilities. Define responsibilities of functional and M&O team members. Identify M&O
   and functional contact points at higher headquarters that will coordinate on study products and assist
   in resolving study issues, if required.
   3.7.3. Data Availability and Accessibility. Determine what data is needed. You may need to break
   generally stated objectives into specific tasks. Identify specific outputs. Determine if the data is avail-
   able to meet output-related study objectives. Determine data availability and accessibility by review-
   ing functional publications, discussions with functional experts, previous manpower standards, etc.
   Data security classification impacts data accessibility. Clearly state in the study contract conditions
   governing availability of data.

3.8. Research Methodology. The primary drivers of research methodology are data requirements and
customer timeliness and accuracy needs. Research methodology impacts study effectiveness and effi-
ciency. Following are some research methods and sources.
   3.8.1. Documentation Review. Review appropriate documentation and records to become familiar
   with the client organization’s mission, organizational structure, and operating procedures. This infor-
   mation will be useful in future phases and will allow the consulting team to understand the dialogue
   and data that may emerge in workshops. In addition, some of the data collected will assist the project
   team in performing manpower calculations when/if appropriate in the project. Ensure functional guid-
   ance is realistic and consistent with peacetime and wartime scenarios and operational concepts. Some
   possible research source examples follow:
      3.8.1.1. Organizational policy and guidance (AFI 38-101) and organization charts.
      3.8.1.2. Web sites/organizational home pages.
      3.8.1.3. Functional publications (local, command or Air Force).
      3.8.1.4. Mission Directive publications (AFPD 10-series).
      3.8.1.5. Strategic plans/performance plans.
      3.8.1.6. Unit Manpower Documents (UMD).
      3.8.1.7. Process Oriented Descriptions (to include resources by process, if available) within appli-
      cable manpower standards.
      3.8.1.8. Applicable operations and contingency plans.
      3.8.1.9. Reports--MEP studies (productivity reports, cost comparison studies), effectiveness
      (Staff Assistance) evaluations, etc.
      3.8.1.10. Management inspections.
      3.8.1.11. Chief of Staff Survey results.
      3.8.1.12. On-the-Job training records and other specialty training material.
      3.8.1.13. Position Descriptions.
      3.8.1.14. Management information systems.
20                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.8.1.15. Facility layout.
        3.8.1.16. Equipment/Technology (systems used, degree of standardization, etc.) listed on the Cus-
        todial Authorized/Custodial Receipt Listing (CA/CRL)/Automated Data Processing Equipment
        accounts, etc.
        3.8.1.17. Organizational chart
        3.8.1.18. The Organization’s Mission Essential Task List
        3.8.1.19. Unit histories
        3.8.1.20. Applicable USAF technical orders, work center records and inspection checklists
        3.8.1.21. Occupational measurement reports
        3.8.1.22. UTC Manpower Detail and Mission Capability Statement
        3.8.1.23. USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)
        3.8.1.24. Performance Measures in use
     3.8.2. Personal Interviews. Primary objectives are to collect information on what and how work is
     done, workload, operating procedures and to involve work center personnel by asking for their ideas.
     Interviews can also be used to gather customer requirements and obtain leadership perspectives for the
     future and the project.
        3.8.2.1. Interview Approach. Provide an agenda (time, subject, and material). Keep interviews
        informal but follow the organizational structure by starting with the target audience (work center
        supervisor, project sponsor, customer, etc.). Some suggested sources are:
            3.8.2.1.1. Chief enlisted manager and 9-skill level superintendent for broad career field infor-
            mation and current career field issues; technical familiarity with lower level tasks and proce-
            dures may not be current.
            3.8.2.1.2. The 7-skill level NCO for the best technical information.
            3.8.2.1.3. The 5-skill level airman or NCO for the best information about how tasks are cur-
            rently accomplished within shops or offices.
            3.8.2.1.4. The 3-skill level apprentice for labor-intensive work and extra work details. The
            3-level can often present an unbiased opinion from the perspective of “fresh eyes”.
        3.8.2.2. Individual vs Group Interviews--Advantages and Disadvantages.
            3.8.2.2.1. Individual interviews take more time but yield more data. Focus questions on a spe-
            cific individual without having other group members waiting. No individual overshadows
            other group members. A potential disadvantage is conflicting information that must be recon-
            ciled.
            3.8.2.2.2. Group interviews are more effective when time is limited or there is disagreement
            among group members. Group interviews normally result in a consensus and help members
            recall additional tasks. Disadvantage: Group think (group follows strongest leader at inter-
            view.)
     3.8.3. On-Site Observations.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              21


       3.8.3.1. Consider visiting a cross-section of locations with the functional representative. Attend
       exercises and deployments. Discuss findings with the functional OPR and verify findings with
       local managers and supervisors. Screen suggestions for potential use.
       3.8.3.2. Use on-site observations to:
          3.8.3.2.1. Identify processes, working relationships, and physical arrangements for improve-
          ment.
          3.8.3.2.2. Increase understanding of procedures and data obtained.
          3.8.3.2.3. Obtain information on work environment and worker productivity (idleness, work
          distribution, team discipline, cleanliness, work layout, excessive standards of living, short sus-
          penses).
       3.8.3.3. When conducting on-site observations:
          3.8.3.3.1. Look closely at high volume of work. People work harder when watched, or
          unusual operating conditions may exist.
          3.8.3.3.2. Avoid biases. Do not let general impressions bias facts and findings.
          3.8.3.3.3. Avoid prolonged observations. It disturbs people and reduces their willingness to
          help.
   3.8.4. Questionnaires. A questionnaire is a quick and inexpensive tool to gather information when
   there is not enough time to interview personnel or potential interviewees at other locations. Develop
   questions as follows:
       3.8.4.1. Determine information needed.
       3.8.4.2. Ask direct, specific questions. Phrase questions so answers are easy, short, and concise.
       Use preprinted response formats when possible.
       3.8.4.3. Avoid emotional connotations. Do not influence answers with phrasing.
       3.8.4.4. Avoid manpower jargon. Direct the questionnaire to the audience’s ability and knowl-
       edge.
       3.8.4.5. Place questions in logical sequence for ease of response and analysis.
       3.8.4.6. Avoid asking attitude or opinion questions. If this is necessary, comply with AFI
       36-2601, Air Force Personnel Survey Program.
   3.8.5. Unit Manning Personnel Roster (UMPR). Collect assigned strength information from the
   UMPR. Also check with work center supervisor(s) to gather information on other full time/part time
   borrowed or loaned personnel.

3.9. Scheduling. The scope of the study will impact study completion time and scheduling. Following is
one way to approach the scheduling activity:
   3.9.1. Estimate the time needed for various study activities.
   3.9.2. Identify the most effective order to accomplish tasks and which tasks can be done simulta-
   neously.
22                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     3.9.3. Estimate the total study time by summing activity/task times; include time for report prepara-
     tion and staffing.
     3.9.4. Prepare a list of major milestones and completion dates (data collection, analysis, workshops,
     report preparation, key briefings, staffing, etc.).
     3.9.5. As required, prepare a detailed schedule identifying tasks, responsible team member, estimated
     completion date, and task procedures.

3.10. Study Alternative. Consider adapting an existing study or at least utilizing the information from an
existing study. Some possibilities are:
     3.10.1. Use information from previous manpower standards.
     3.10.2. Use other DoD or federal agency standards. Use private sector job standards.
     3.10.3. Use any portion of existing manpower standards that apply to the function under study.
     3.10.4. Consider the level of M&O community involvement. Projects which cut across units, bases,
     MAJCOMs, etc., should include and identify applicable M&O units as an audience in the Communi-
     cation Plan (see Figure 3.3. for an example). Depending on the project, they may be utilized for data
     collection, validation, or to educate functional clients on how to perform certain project-related activ-
     ities. As a result, the appropriate M&O personnel should be kept informed of upcoming projects,
     timelines, and taskings that may impact them and their units. A Data Collection Plan (see Figure 3.4.
     for an example) assists with this effort.
     3.10.5. Consider the following client organization’s characteristics when planning.
        3.10.5.1. Complexity and Size. Large, complex functions require more planning, research, and
        study effort; consider cost and coverage needs.
        3.10.5.2. Stability. Studies of dynamic functions undergoing frequent reorganizations, changes in
        workload, and shifts in responsibilities could be costly and long term. In these functions, consider
        short-term, low-cost studies. For standards development studies, also consider future maintenance
        of the standard.
        3.10.5.3. Degree of Standardization in Organization, Procedures, Equipment, and Layout. Con-
        sider the level of standardization to determine measurement methods. For example, in a man-
        power standard development project, work sampling is appropriate for very standardized
        functions, but very costly. Consider the level of effort and return on the effort when choosing mea-
        surement methods.
        3.10.5.4. External mandates. Consider legislative, Office of the Secretary Defense, Federal Avia-
        tion Administration and other mandates which limit scope of change.

3.11. Scope Activity Descriptions.
     3.11.1. Micro. The overall method for communicating and participating in the project may be a func-
     tion of preexisting systems, such as weekly staff meetings, natural work groups, and preformed teams.
     However informal the planning, the participants must still understand the objective and goals of the
     project as well as their roles and responsibilities. Simply letting participants know how much of their
     time they are expected to devote to the project can greatly clarify involvement. Some amount of data
     collection will likely be necessary for any project and a plan to identify what data needs to be
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                23


   obtained, where it exists, who is the OPR, and the timeline for collecting the data should be under-
   stood. Some methods to consider for collecting the data are surveys, workshops, existing documents,
   and databases.
   3.11.2. Mid-level. As the organizational and impact scope increase, so does the necessity for having
   a plan to clarify “who will do what by when.” With expansion in project scope, the associated increase
   in data collection, analysis, communication, coordination, and necessary buy-in often requires sepa-
   rate plans to be developed. A communication plan can greatly improve the information flow to appro-
   priate audiences and ensure that no group is left out of the loop. Similarly, a data collection plan can
   take proactive steps to identify what information will be needed during the project and who will be
   responsible for collecting it. Finally, a project plan serves as a roadmap to help the team anticipate
   planning events, and evaluate progress (or lack thereof). There are a number of commercial software
   programs that can facilitate project planning. The project team may find it useful to also establish a
   Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) (see Figure 3.5. for an MOA format).
   3.11.3. Macro. For a larger-scoped project, often teams will be formed at different levels of control.
   Specifically, the project team would need to be formed, as well as the actual project team dedicated to
   working the project from the partnered organization. Other smaller Issue, Process, or Tiger teams can
   be identified, as opportunities emerge. Finally, there may be a need for an executive steering commit-
   tee to be formed, representing the project sponsor (as the chair, possibly) and key decision-making
   personnel from across the organization such as MAJCOM or Air Staff functional managers. This
   committee would make senior decisions, be briefed on project status, and ensure buy-in at the senior
   level across the organization. Each of these teams should understand its respective charter, the project
   objective(s), their participation responsibilities, and the Seven-Phase Approach. Depending on the
   scope and objectives of the project, certain subject matter experts (SMEs) will need to be identified as
   secondary/advisory team members (such as legal, Air Force Personnel Center, personnel, etc.) who
   will participate when appropriate. A macro-level study often requires more formal planning for the
   project, data collection, and/or communication, depending on the specific project objectives. More
   detail may be added to the project, data collection, and communication plans. Project-planning soft-
   ware or a standard spreadsheet may facilitate documenting the formal plan. A macro-scoped project,
   due to its often-heavy coordination and data collection burden, will probably benefit from a formal-
   ized MOA between the project team and the functional OPR.

3.12. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA does a number of things for those involved in a
study or improvement initiative. It primarily specifies the purpose of the project and the responsibilities of
the main participants. It is advisable to staff an MOA through the function’s chain of command and the
M&O chain of command and have it signed by the senior partners; i.e., Air Staff or MAJCOM functional
OPR, AFMIA/CC, etc. A signed MOA ensures senior leadership approval and support of the project.

Section 3D—As-Is Process Development--Phase 3

3.13. General Concepts. Identify the organization’s current state through analysis of “What do you
do?”, “Who is it done for?”, “How do you do it?”, “What does it cost to do it?”, and “How well do you do
it?”. Answering all of these questions may be outside the interest of your respective project, but under-
stand that the information associated with each one can prove very useful in later phases. As-Is data col-
lection should be done at the highest possible level of analysis while still being able to answer the
appropriate questions. The process of defining the As-Is state will identify worthwhile target processes for
improvements, uncover improvement opportunities within those processes and help focus opportunity
research in Phase 4 (e.g., comparative analysis, benchmarking). Without the baseline provided by the
As-Is analysis, it becomes impossible to know if any organizational/process changes are truly better than
the original state. For example, manpower changes associated with process redesign can only be quanti-
fied if the initial manpower for the process is established. Collection of As-Is data can be done using the
measurement techniques outlined in volume 2 of this publication. Following are several specific consid-
erations regarding each of the key As-Is question areas:
   3.13.1. What do you do? Regardless of the scope of the project, understanding the ultimate mission
   and outcome(s) of the target organization is a critical initial step in defining the current state. This will
   serve as the anchor to help identify additional information (e.g., “What products/services provide
   THESE outcomes?”, “Who are the customers of these products and services [which deliver those out-
   comes]?”, “What processes create the products and services for these customers [who needs these out-
   comes]?”, etc).
       3.13.1.1. The project team must identify the appropriate sources of this initial information (e.g.,
       published plans, guidance, interviews, and workshops). Outputs and processes performed are also
       useful details to capture with regard to the “What do you do?” question. Often, current manpower
       standards, specifically the process oriented description (POD) statements, serve as a source for
       initial process lists. If a current standard does not exist, or current processes are not defined in the
       standard, a POD may need to be developed. POD development is discussed in paragraph 3.22. of
       this publication.
       3.13.1.2. An initial analysis of the process list considers whether it is truly directed by some guid-
       ance or higher level strategy. It is valuable in the As-Is phase to understand what you are doing,
       but it is also insightful to compare that to what you are required to do. The distinction may reflect
       directed versus inferred/assumed work. The remaining nondirected work must be challenged and
       may be an immediate source of work savings. The assumed work can be measured (see paragraph
       3.13.4.) to reflect workload and man-hours associated with work not mandated by the Department
       of Defense, Air Force, or MAJCOM. If assumed work processes are eliminated, the result would
       be that the organization would have more time and possibly people to dedicate to doing the man-
       dated job. Having some idea of the recuperated workload may be considered worth the effort of
       measuring the assumed workload.
   3.13.2. Who is it done for? Identifying the customer group(s) is valuable for several reasons. First, by
   distinguishing these groups, you identify the sources of information on gathering current process per-
   formance (see paragraph 3.13.5.). Secondly, it establishes a baseline for current customers who can be
   compared to the future customers and the requirements that they will have for the To-Be products/ser-
   vices. Finally, by truly clarifying “Who uses this product/service,” or “Who demands this outcome?”
   certain perspectives/stakeholders may be included in the future design process that may have other-
30                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     wise been ignored. This question identifies who currently has an opinion about your current perfor-
     mance and may dictate how good you need to be in the future. This is especially important when
     “level of service” is a major workload driver (e.g. requirements to serve a customer within one minute
     vs. 15 minutes at a commissary checkout would influence the manpower requirement).
     3.13.3. How do you do it? The process can be listed or flowed out at an appropriate level of detail to
     identify redundancy, wasted time, unnecessary steps, under/over-utilized people, etc. Process flow or
     process mapping diagramming techniques are discussed in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, and reflect
     just one of many ways to capture this information. In addition, organizational charts, physical layouts,
     etc. may be useful in painting a clear picture on how efficiently/inefficiently the products/services are
     being produced for the customers. Ideally, this activity should be performed on processes after the
     processes have been prioritized and selected for improvement based on established criteria.
     3.13.4. What does it cost to do it? Of particular interest here is identifying the current manpower,
     equipment, and supply costs associated with performing the organization’s mission and processes.
     Ultimately, this will serve as the baseline to which the To-Be state’s manpower will be compared. As
     a result, the project team must identify the level of detail in which resources must be identified. For
     example, will the Air Force Corporate Board approving the To-Be state want to have the costs/sav-
     ings/new requirements broken out by processes? If so, having a by-process breakdown of current
     resource costs may be necessary. On the other hand, if the project sponsor or project team feels that
     only high-evel resource data will be necessary for the leadership body to compare (total current autho-
     rized manpower), then the data collection may simply come from the current manpower standard or
     the currently documented funded and unfunded authorizations on the UMD. Consideration also needs
     to be given regarding other resource costs. For example, should facility and equipment costs be cap-
     tured, and if so, is it necessary to break them out by processes? Activity-Based Costing is one useful
     tool for assigning resource costs to tasks and outputs (cost objects). Knowing resource costs at a high
     level is also useful for prioritizing processes, so that you can identify which processes are worth
     improving. Typically, processes that are important to the mission consume most of the resources
     (manpower, dollars, etc.) and warrant the effort of collecting and analyzing data, doing opportunity
     research and redesigning. Below are some benefits and drawbacks associated with different
     approaches to As-Is manpower cost analysis.
        3.13.4.1. Detailed (low-level) Manpower Costing by Process. This represents the most accurate
        time and cost-intensive data collection method. Process frequencies and per accomplishment
        times (PATs) are collected in some forum, such as actual field measurement or from workshop
        input, to identify the manpower cost associated with the process. If existing manpower documents
        have this information broken out by processes, some time can be saved. Additional information
        may be gathered regarding the process as well. For example, crew size, required skill level,
        required grade level, and workload factors (WLF) may be identified as current process measures
        of interest. The main benefits of this approach are: sound data is available for prioritizing/selecting
        which processes should be improved, the data is useful for comparing process costs when doing
        comparative analysis and benchmarking with other organizations, and it lays the groundwork for
        the To-Be manpower standard. The drawbacks are as follows: it is time intensive and processes
        are costed out even though they may ultimately be determined not worthwhile or have room to
        improve (after prioritization). Data collection in workshops or from the field can be automated,
        possibly reducing project time for this level of cost data collection. One valuable technique is to
        utilize a “GroupWare” platform, where workshop participants can submit data using computers
        linked to a common server. Many participants can enter workload estimates simultaneously, and
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                31


     the computer can integrate the information almost immediately. The validity of the data depends
     on the quality of the data submitted by the participants. Very dissimilar estimates of common pro-
     cess workload can be addressed in the meeting, leading to consensus or a requirement for a man-
     power site visit.
     3.13.4.2. High-Level Manpower Costing by Process. Each process is assigned a cost based on the
     estimate of total resources associated with it. This estimate can be collected in a workshop envi-
     ronment with SMEs or using other techniques. The total resources for the organization can be
     multiplied by the percent estimate to arrive at a manpower per process cost estimate, useful for
     prioritizing and selecting worthwhile processes to improve. The selected processes can then be
     costed out to more detail as described in paragraph 3.13.4.1., if appropriate, for the study. Benefits
     include: less time required, data is still available for prioritizing/selecting processes, detailed cost-
     ing is only performed on worthwhile processes, and some degree of cost data is available for com-
     parative analysis and benchmarking. Remember that the current authorized manpower is a
     reflection of both direct and indirect workload. The indirect workload is separate from what the
     process being estimated requires, and should be subtracted out of the authorized total prior to com-
     parison. For example, if the current authorized manpower for 5 processes was 100, some of that
     100 is a reflection of indirect work, and should be subtracted out prior to estimating the relative
     workload to accomplish each individual process. The manpower associated with the indirect work
     will be reflected in a Standard Indirect Allowed Man-hour (SIAM) equation (See AFMAN
     38-208, Volume 2), and therefore should be subtracted out of the total authorized manpower in
     order to isolate the direct workload.
     3.13.4.3. High-Level Manpower Costing for Organization/Work center(s). Some project teams
     and sponsors may wish to only evaluate bottom-line manpower for the organization or work cen-
     ter(s) in the As-Is phase. This would be represented by the manpower requirements (funded and
     unfunded) documented on the UMD. Benefits include minimal time involved with costing As-Is
     manpower costs. Drawbacks include: no costs broken down by process making As-Is versus
     To-Be process cost comparison impossible; no cost data to prioritize and select processes to
     improve; and no data to compare process costs in comparative analysis.
     3.13.4.4. Reach-back Costing Option. If a high-level costing option is used, an opportunity still
     exists to create detailed As-Is cost data at a later time in the project. In a reactive approach the
     project team can elect to wait until improvement recommendations are identified (for the To-Be
     state), but prior to implementation, to measure the As-Is process(es) which changed. This mini-
     mizes measurement and still allows comparison of As-Is and To-Be costs.
  3.13.5. How Well Do You Do It? This is the effectiveness dimension, which cannot be ignored. Very
  few Air Force organizations have a formal approach to capture this information, but this performance
  information identifies improvement opportunities and ultimately provides insight into effectiveness of
  the improvement effort. As-Is process performance may be available in inspection reports, cycle time
  data, customer complaints, rework, on-time work, and other performance measures. In addition, since
  the customer defines what is and is not good performance, collecting performance information from
  the customer is ideal. Surveys, focus group interviews, individual interviews, field measurement or
  workshops are some methods for capturing such data. Current performance may be a useful criterion
  to use when prioritizing and selecting processes to improve. For example, a high resource cost, and
  high value (to the Air Force or the organization) process may initially not appear to be a worthwhile
  target for improvement. Only by understanding that the current performance level is below par does
32                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     this process become a necessary target for improvement. Likewise, if performance is outstanding,
     then the opportunity for improvement might be considered less beneficial.

3.14. Scope Activity Descriptions. In many project scenarios, a prioritization of processes/steps/issues
based on some criteria are performed so that only viable processes/steps/issues are targeted for improve-
ment. It may become obvious at this time that lower priority processes, for example, may not provide
enough return on the investment of time and resources to warrant improving. As a result, it may be only
through the collecting and analyzing of As-Is data that the scope of the project is adjusted down. A project
may initially be perceived as a macro-scope effort, but only after profiling, prioritizing, and selecting
improvement targets does it become clear that the scope is more focused than originally thought. It is just
as possible, however, that the objectives of the project may require a broadening of the scope, once the
As-Is picture becomes clearer. For any project scope, the sponsor or project team decides on what level of
data collection and analysis is appropriate. Workshop data collection is a common technique for this
phase, re-emphasizing the importance of knowledgeable and representative participant selection.
     3.14.1. Micro. This type of project identifies a focused target for improvement. The data collection
     burden is somewhat lower than a larger scoped project because only data on a single process needs to
     be collected. The “What, For Whom, How, How Much, and How Well” questions can also be col-
     lected relatively quickly by engaging SMEs and appropriate sources of data, typically from the local
     organization. For example, customers can be identified and interviewed or surveyed relatively easily
     in a micro-scoped project. If manpower requirement determination is of interest, the level of detail for
     data collection will depend on the sponsor interest. Even for smaller scoped projects, automated data
     collection can serve as a useful tool in collecting cost data, customer inputs, mapping, and perhaps
     even simulation of the process. If validation of data is necessary, the fact that the improvement effort
     is localized should require a relatively manageable coordination task. Appropriate approving authori-
     ties at all levels should be kept informed, as should be outlined in the Communications Plan. The Five
     Fronts described in paragraph 3.3.1. should be considered when trying to understand all possible fac-
     tors effecting even a local and focused process.
     3.14.2. Mid-level. By definition, this type of project scope includes more processes or a larger piece
     of the organization, but typically has limited processes identified allowing each process to be evalu-
     ated. The target processes may cut across several work centers or MAJCOMs, requiring a larger coor-
     dination and communication effort in order to collect data and gain buy-in. The processes of interest
     may have been selected based on an obvious need for improvement, large resources associated with
     conducting the processes, or they may be the result of a prioritization and selection of key processes
     from a larger initial process list. Whatever the origin, the target processes need to be run through the
     remaining As-Is questions. Gathering valid cost data (manpower, equipment, supplies, [ABC is a
     technique that uses the cost data] etc.), regulations which identify the mandated processes, customer
     inputs, and current performance measures at this scope will require more coordination and input from
     the functional community it impacts. Workshops, field measurement, internet research, site visits, and
     surveys are some methods of collecting such information. Collect as much of this data as possible dur-
     ing the familiarization phase of the project and present it to the project team or sponsor for validation.
     In addition to gathering and analyzing the data, the processes should be mapped out at the appropriate
     level of detail to uncover process inefficiencies, and to assist in future manpower determinant compar-
     isons. Some time should also be taken by the project team to consider the Five Fronts relative to the
     processes under consideration. This approach can identify constraints, As-Is organizational architec-
     ture, technology standardization, and people-related issues such as training status and utilization. The
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                 33


   outcome of the data collection and analysis outlined above should provide a useful and insightful
   As-Is picture of the organization and the improvement-worthy processes.
   3.14.3. Macro. Creating an As-Is picture of an organization in a macro scope project may require
   some information to be organized. By definition, this type of project scope includes multiple pro-
   cesses of the organization, has a large Air Force impact (crossing several MAJCOM(s)s, a whole
   function, multiple functions, or the whole Air Force), and may necessitate prioritization of processes.
   To accomplish this, a list of current processes is generated (typically from a POD in the current man-
   power standard), possibly reflecting mandated and assumed work processes in addition to the POD
   list. If no current list of processes exists, a POD will need to be generated using tools and techniques
   like brainstorming, or current directive documents. Often, taking a step back to identify the true cur-
   rent mission and objectives for the organization can prove useful in establishing a point from which
   the customers, outputs, and processes can be identified. Such information can come from mission
   statements, strategic plans, organizational documents, directives, senior leadership input, etc. Criteria
   for prioritization of processes should be defined (e.g., manpower resources dedicated to the process,
   mission criticality, current performance “gap” [i.e., problem processes], etc). If necessary, these crite-
   ria can be weighted differently to reflect their respective importance. Each process can then be rated
   relative to the different criteria, and weighted total ratings for each process will reflect the prioritiza-
   tion. Based on the time availability and interest of the study, an important exercise may be to prioritize
   the process list while it includes assumed work. If a criterion for prioritization is manpower cost to do
   the process, and an assumed work process is identified as consuming a lot of resources, this may be
   important information to present to senior leadership. If time or interest does not permit the evaluation
   and improvement of all processes, the top processes from the prioritized list can be selected for the
   project. The selected processes are then mapped. Some time should also be taken by the project team
   to consider the Five Fronts relative to the processes under consideration. This approach can identify
   constraints, As-Is organizational architecture, technology standardization, and people-related issues
   such as training status and utilization. Often, in a macro-scoped project, the Policy Front can be a sig-
   nificant contributor to process inefficiency and may require consideration of modifying policy in the
   To-Be state. The outcome of the data collection and analysis outlined above should provide a useful
   and insightful As-Is picture of the organization and the improvement-worthy processes.

3.15. Quick Wins. During this phase, obvious improvement opportunities often emerge which would
require minimal effort and coordination to implement. These “quick wins” improvements can be as sim-
ple as deleting an obviously redundant step in a process, eliminating the production of a report which no
one uses, introducing a coordination step to eliminate unnecessary miscommunication, or using a more
appropriate tool in a process. Such decisions can immediately improve operations and serve a great pur-
pose in establishing or maintaining momentum for the project. In the context of change management,
even simple, minor changes which eliminate unnecessary work send out a message that this project really
intends to make things better, thus improving the likelihood of buy-in from the field-level workers. Even
minor changes such as these should still be documented and carried forward to the To-Be phase and final
report.

Section 3E—Opportunity Research--Phase 4

3.16. General Concepts. The Opportunity Research Phase is simply about identifying appropriate
changes. Two things have to happen. First, we have to answer the questions, “What is the environment
(current and/or future), and what are the requirements in that environment?” The environmental scan
34                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


addresses these by identifying trends, restrictions, boundaries, developments, etc., that will impact the
organization or process. The project team as a whole can do this scan or specific processes or dimensions
of the environment can be assigned to subgroups to focus on. This information is then run through the “fil-
ter” of, “So what does all this mean to the organization/process we want to change?” The outcome of this
analysis is an identification of areas where changes need to happen. Second, the project team or subgroup
has to figure out where the changes should come from and what they should be. Some improvement ideas
may be obvious or intuitive. Other appropriate changes are not so obvious. Innovative thinking often
requires looking outside the organization at how others are handling similar requirements, processes,
activities, etc. If improvement ideas are only developed from within, the organization runs the risk of sim-
ply recreating its As-Is state or missing a real opportunity to see what others have figured out. This is the
purpose of the Research step in this phase. Comparison and benchmark organizations are identified,
researched, and analyzed to generate possible improvement ideas which will meet current and/or future
requirements. Figure 3.6. provides an overview of this phase, with the “focus” path being defined by the
intent of the project. Two main dimensions make up Opportunity Research: Environmental Scanning and
the eventual Researching for Opportunities.

Figure 3.6. Opportunity Research Diagram.




Figure 3.6. represents where to look for those improvement opportunities that will be based on the focus
(current, future, combination) of the project. Table 3.1. outlines how the different focus results in a differ-
ent level of analysis regarding how broad the scan should be, then an environmental scan would need to
be conducted to articulate just what IS the future environment. In this case, the environmental scan would
identify future customer requirements, trends and other potential factors which will define the operating
environment of the To-Be organization. Opportunity research targets organizations that are currently

excelling at those things (e.g., competencies, processes, and activities) the project organization must per-
form in the future. A combination focus is also possible (represented by the dashed line), with short-term
improvement research targets being identified for immediate improvements, and other targets being
researched for longer-term initiatives aimed at handling future requirements. A type of concurrent envi-
ronmental scan (current and future customer requirements, factors) would happen in this scenario to
address both process improvements that address what needs to get done and those things that WILL need
to get done. A more detailed description of Environmental Scan and Researching for Opportunities are
presented in Table 3.1.

   3.16.1. Environmental Scan. The primary issues to address in this phase are, “What’s happening cur-
   rently?” What’s coming?”, and “What does it mean to this organization/process?” The first two ques-
   tions constitute gaining situational awareness relative to the organization or process of interest. The
36                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     last question is critical, because without it, the exercise is simply research without application.
     Depending on the project, it may be necessary to scan the environment for possible factors, technolo-
     gies, or trends affecting the current or future organization/process or may affect the future organiza-
     tion/process. The environment can be broken out in many different ways, as described below in
     Figure 3.7. Within each environmental dimension, often societal, economic, political, technological,
     or other aspects can be investigated. Often, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT)
     analysis is a useful way to understand what all this information means to the process or organization.
     Using a facilitated exercise, the workshop participants (or subgroup members) analyze the strengths,
     weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the organization in light of the environmental information
     collected. This is the “So what?” or “What does it mean to us?” application, which is so critical for
     identifying improvement options.

Figure 3.7. Dimensions of the Environment.




     The project team can investigate the future environment for the organization across environmental
     dimensions (like the ones above), or teams/subgroups/individuals can be assigned specific processes
     to evaluate against these dimensions. Another approach is to have subgroups focus on scanning one
     dimension’s impact on all relevant processes. Finally, the group or subgroups can be tasked to evalu-
     ate a single or multiple “Aspects to consider” within each dimension or across all the dimensions. The
     specific dimensions are described below:
        3.16.1.1. Macro Environment. This is a world-wide view; it evaluates relevant issues in society at
        large. Typical sources might be the internet, Cable News Network (CNN), Early Bird, long-range
        planning documents, Defense Technical Info Center homepage, etc.
        3.16.1.2. Industry Environment. This identifies relevant issues in organizations with similar mis-
        sion, customer, product, or service. Typical sources include defense industry journals, internet,
        newspapers, Early Bird, USAF Strategic Plan, etc.
        3.16.1.3. Customer Environment. This provides insight into demographics, segments, trends, pat-
        terns, and requirements. If information is gathered directly from the customer, this can be a pow-
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                             37


     erful and insightful source. Any customer information (recommendations, future requirements,
     etc.) collected in the As-Is can be very useful at this point. Other ways to gather this information
     can be through surveys, focus groups, workshops, internet, magazines, General Accounting Office
     reports, internet sites, customer strategic plans, etc.
  3.16.2. Strengths- Weaknesses- Opportunities- Threats (SWOT) Analysis. By examining internal
  strengths, the project team can discover untapped potential. Examining internal weaknesses, the
  project team can identify gaps in performance, vulnerabilities, and erroneous assumptions about their
  existing strategies. The external opportunities and threats are the positive and negative characteristics
  of the external environment. Using information gathered from available sources, study teams can
  identify opportunities for improvement and assess threats to determine the organization’s ability to
  defend against them. Using the information gathered in the As-Is analysis and the Environmental
  Scan, some analysis has to be performed to understand what it means to build the To-Be state. What-
  ever approach is taken to do SWOT analysis, some consideration should be given for the different
  dimensions of each aspect of the environment. The outcome of this activity is a list of things to exploit
  or overcome in order to excel in the future environment. Several Approaches can be taken.
     3.16.2.1. The team as a whole can create lists of Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats for
     the whole organization (or processes under consideration) using tools like flip charts, grease-
     boards, or electronic groupware. This would focus on all of the dimensions, and would consider
     any appropriate aspects for the processes.
     3.16.2.2. Subgroups can focus on a single dimension of the environments, considering any appro-
     priate aspects of information that may be useful (for example, group 2 might be assigned the com-
     petitive dimension of the environment). They would consider things like technological, political
     and societal trends to create a SWOT for that dimension. The subgroups would then out-brief each
     other to create a master SWOT for the whole organization that collectively addresses all aspects of
     the environment.
     3.16.2.3. Subgroups can focus on a single aspect to consider (for example, group 2 could focus on
     just TECHNOLOGY), and would identify SWOT issues across all of the environmental dimen-
     sions and processes.
     3.16.2.4. Subgroups can be assigned the responsibility of generating one piece of the SWOT (for
     example, group 2 might focus just on THREATS). They would need to be familiar with the Envi-
     ronmental Scan information across all of the different environmental dimensions. The subgroups
     would then out-brief to compile their master SWOT analysis.
     3.16.2.5. Subgroups (or individuals) can be assigned specific processes to evaluate against the
     environmental information. The master SWOT would then simply be the sum of the SWOTs for
     the different processes (plus any issues which may obviously cut across processes).
     3.16.2.6. Use any other approach which evaluates the organization or its processes relative to the
     environmental scan information.
  3.16.3. Researching for Opportunities. Whether the focus is current or future, the research activity of
  Opportunity Research is where the new ideas for improvement come from. The SWOT analysis has
  identified the gap between current and future. It identifies where you are strong, where you are weak,
  and what realistic performance levels are. Finally, by evaluating how/how well others perform similar
  tasks, processes, or outcomes, new methods for improved performance may become clear.
38                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


       3.16.3.1. There are basically two types of researches: Primary and Secondary.
           3.16.3.1.1. Primary Research is the practice of searching for information about a particular
           subject using direct sources, which include (but are not limited to) making direct contact with
           the potential partner using e-mail, telephone surveys, mail/fax surveys, and face-to-face inter-
           views. The Internet/World Wide Web (WWW) contains a number of information sources and
           contacts relevant to best practices and benchmarking.
           3.16.3.1.2. Secondary Research is the practice of searching for information about a particular
           subject using indirect sources, which include (but are not limited to) using books, newspapers,
           journals, etc. The Internet/WWW contains a number of information sources and contacts rele-
           vant to best practices and benchmarking.
       3.16.3.2. Three activities take place in the Research for Opportunities step: Identify benchmark
       targets, perform comparative analysis, and perform benchmarking research (or some less formal
       information gathering).
           3.16.3.2.1. Identify benchmark targets. Target organizations or processes are selected because
           they either do well what you need to do now, or they do well what you will need to do. Either
           way, some aspect of “what” they do should be similar, but it does not need to be identical. Tar-
           gets can come from inside or outside the project organization. An obvious first source for tar-
           gets should be from a best practices clearinghouse to possibly locate the current outstanding
           performers in the same process (to compare “apples to apples”). See AFMIA’s home page,
           and click on Best Practices, for assistance. This is called functionally picking a target. Other
           targets may be less directly related, sharing similar type outcomes or components of the pro-
           cess. For example, an aircraft maintenance department identified that the future environment
           will require faster turn around time on their planes. They selected a top Indy pit crew to evalu-
           ate and benchmark. Another example of a generic or outcome-based comparison was the Bird
           Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program. The project members identified that this is a crisis
           response type process that needs to be improved. They evaluated who currently does crisis
           response well, and selected a top-ranked fire department as the benchmark target. The idea of
           forward-positioning equipment was just one valuable improvement option that came out of
           this generic target selection. Often the most dramatic results come from selecting a target that
           is very different from the project organization.

3.17. Comparative Analysis. This step evaluates the performance difference and the magnitude of that
difference between the project organization (process) and the target. Let’s say that the BASH process
identified the fire department as a target because they were top performers in a similar crisis response
field. Comparative analysis would identify that the fire department can respond to a crisis and be on site
in three minutes. Here is where As-Is performance measurement becomes important. Proper As-Is defini-
tion ensures that you have data for comparison. “How much better is three minutes than your organiza-
tion’s performance?” The less information that is known about the As-Is performance or resources, the
harder a comparison will be. It can be dangerous to make an improvement recommendation without this
information. For example, if the benchmarking target organization can respond in three minutes on a cer-
tain process, and the project organization can respond in three minutes, it may appear that no improve-
ment opportunity exists. But if it takes the target organization half of the manpower to respond in that time
than the project organization does, there is great opportunity for adopting improvements. Unless of
course, the project organization does not know how many manpower resources the response process
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              39


takes. Comparative analysis uncovers performance gaps between how the project organization and the
target organization are performing.

3.18. Benchmarking. If comparative analysis answers “How much?” of a difference exists between the
project organization and the target, then benchmarking answers “How do they achieve that much perfor-
mance?” It focuses on the actual task or process accomplishment, and uncovers possible techniques, tools,
or approaches which can help the project organization improve. Benchmarking is the process of finding
and adapting best practices to improve organizational performance. True benchmarking is a formal pro-
cess of partnering and sharing information. For this type of information gathering, there is a formal bench-
marking code of conduct and a formal approach to conducting a benchmarking study. Formal
benchmarking studies often provide outstanding information, but can be time consuming and labor inten-
sive, which may be unreasonable for your particular study. For less formal investigative research, other
approaches can be used. Informal benchmarking can result from site visits (“industrial tourism”), televi-
sion/media, previous experiences, or other sources. The goal of both formal and informal benchmarking
is to uncover the approaches which may be adapted (not adopted) to fit and improve the project organiza-
tion. Seldom, if ever, will a best practice approach or improvement idea uncovered during this research
transition smoothly into another organization. The ultimate recommendations that come from Opportu-
nity Research will be either to maintain the status quo of the processor or do one of the following:
   3.18.1. Improve. This typically results from a redesign of the process. The improvement can be any-
   where from minor to dramatic, even requiring the process to be designed from scratch. An improve-
   ment recommendation can cut across many functions or departments, or it can simply change how a
   single unit completes the process. Whatever the degree of change being proposed, the process owners
   should be critically involved in designing the improvement recommendations. Typical improvement
   recommendations are multi-skilling workers, eliminating redundancies, inserting technology to auto-
   mate or assist process steps (e.g., a grocery clerk using a scanner), modifying the processes to flow
   more smoothly, gearing the process more for the customer, removing unnecessary layers of manage-
   ment, or modifying unnecessarily restrictive policies. Of course, there are limitless other ways to
   improve processes. Notice that some of these improvements may cut across many processes, func-
   tions, or departments. Consider the interrelationship of the five fronts when developing improvement
   ideas. Changes in technology, for instance, may require changes or improvements in training. Some
   improvement ideas may require relatively little coordination or implementation time. Such “quick
   wins” are opportunities for immediate improvement in current processes that may build organiza-
   tional momentum for change. Throughout all the project phases and activities, the teams will collect
   suggestions for changes. These may range from relatively simple improvement ideas to more complex
   opportunities. Implementing “quick wins” is a way to show immediate results from the project and to
   build momentum by actually beginning to change things while the project is in progress. Team mem-
   bers should be alert for opportunities for immediate process improvement as they gather data in work-
   shops, interviews, and through quantitative analysis. Potential “quick wins” should be documented
   when identified, including benefits, timing, cost and any additional research assigned to design team
   or extended team members. Analysis at this point need not be rigorous. Criteria for “quick wins” will
   help qualify ideas as they arise (e.g., cost under $10,000 and take less than 30 to 60 days to imple-
   ment). These criteria will vary based on the size of the organization and the scope of the project. Com-
   mon “quick wins” include elimination of low value activities or activities that are no longer necessary,
   such as multi-part forms, administrative reports that are no longer relevant, or services that are no
   longer demanded. It may be helpful to provide a common format to document and track “quick wins”
   or other short term opportunities. One sample format is shown below:
40                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002

     3.18.2. Eliminate. In some projects, a process, subprocess, or activity is identified as something
     which may be outside the mission of the organization, is unnecessary, or will not be needed in the
     future environment. In these cases, the proposal to eliminate the process or activity may be appropri-
     ate. For example, one agency was still spending resources to generate a report which was not used by
     anyone. The process to create this report was eliminated. Another example may be for a function or
     agency to eliminate conducting an annual conference. Opportunity research may have identified a
     more cost-effective method for disseminating information (if that outcome is still desired).
        3.18.2.1. If a detailed costing strategy was used in the As-Is phase then savings associated with
        eliminating the performance of a process or activity can be clearly estimated. If manpower costs
        and facility costs were defined for a process and that process is eliminated, the cost savings should
        be relatively easy to determine. If a more high level As-Is costing strategy was used, then this
        information can still be attained, but will require detailed costing analysis at this time (see
        Reach-Back Costing in the As-Is Phase, paragraph 3.13.4.4.).
        3.18.2.2. Elimination of any process or activity can have impacts on other functions or depart-
        ments, which may rely on, or be involved with that process. Whenever elimination is recom-
        mended, generate a list of customers and stakeholders of the eliminated process or activity.
        Coordinate and communicate this change with them. In addition, consider the Five Fronts when
        eliminating anything. Will it impact training, technology, career progression, policy/guidance,
        facilities, etc?
        3.18.2.3. Many organizations confuse improving performance with shifting responsibility
        because it eases workload. Perhaps in the As-Is or Environmental Scanning phases, it became
        obvious that an organization’s mission does not require it to do something it currently does. The
        resulting suggestion may be to transfer the work to another organization or function, or to out-
        source the work.
        3.18.2.4. Transferring the work requires coordination and buy-in from the organization assuming
        responsibility. The ultimate decision-making authority for the To-Be will ask whether this assum-
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                               41


       ing organization agrees with the proposal to shift the work to them. If not, the proposal will likely
       be disapproved until agreement is reached. Manpower issues also will exist based on the autho-
       rized manpower assigned to that workload. As the workload shifts, so too should the authorized
       manpower.
       3.18.2.5. If outsourced, legal restrictions will need to be followed. Again, customers and stake-
       holders must be contacted to ensure that the contracted service meets their requirements. One way
       to accomplish this is to have customer and/or stakeholders present when drafting the SOW, or at
       least give them an opportunity to review the requirements. It is the customer’s responsibility to
       draft the SOW and have manpower and contracting assistance.

3.19. Options Package. Whatever the proposed solutions, they should be documented and presented in a
way that is useful and rigorous for the sponsor(s) to make a decision. If possible, costs and benefits should
be described for the proposed changes and improvements. In some cases, the project sponsors may wish
to select from several options or scenarios. Ideally, this should have been articulated by the sponsor dur-
ing the Project Definition or Planning Phases, so that the project team or subgroups could have collected
information and researched with this context in mind. Some possible scenarios are listed below:
   3.19.1. Best Case/ Most Likely/Least Likely. It may be a reflection of the future environment being
   either friendly or nonfriendly to the organization/function.

Figure 3.9. Prepare Options Scenarios Example.


                                Prepare Options
                             (May be scenario-based)
Best Case
 - Decentralize all operations
 - Eliminate Key Process 1
 - Combine Key Processes 2 & 4

Most Likely
 - Streamline all key processes with new computer technology

Least Likely
 - Benchmark key process 1
 - Streamline key processes 2,3,4

   3.19.2. Low Cost/ High Cost/ Middle of Road. The groups may develop different proposals or com-
   binations of proposals based on how restrictive the budget is.
   3.19.3. Future Scenario1/Future Scenario2. It may be specifically defined by the sponsor (“I want one
   option that assumes that air expeditionary forces are in place, and another that assumes it is not.”) or
   can be developed from the Environmental Scan.
42                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002

                            Prepare Options
      (May be several options for one or more future environments)

If future environment is “X”
 - Decentralize all operations
 - Eliminate Key Process 1
 - Combine Key Processes 2 & 4

If future environment is “Y”, choose 1
 - Streamline all key processes with new computer technology
 - Benchmark key process 1
 - Streamline key processes 2,3,4

     3.19.4. Single option. The sponsor may simply leave the design up to the Project Team, and only
     require a single solution be presented. This may be an option if the Sponsor had a clear vision of what
     the To-Be organization should look like, and the project team was simply tasked with proposing
     HOW it should get there.
     3.19.5. Multiple Options. The sponsor may want several options to pick from. This may be one of the
     scenarios listed above, or he or she may have some other criteria for defining the option categories.
     3.19.6. Menu listing. This may simply be a prioritized list of improvement proposals which the spon-
     sor can select to design the To-Be state he or she wants developed.
     3.19.7. Each proposal may be presented with the cost/benefit/timeline described, such as in the exam-
     ple in Figure 3.11.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                           43

   3.19.8. The option(s) selected by the project sponsor will provide the direction and strategy for the
   To-Be organization. Detail and action groups will be formed to “add flesh” to the selected option. Any
   detailed manpower savings are reflected in the To-Be scenario and briefed to the Air Force Corporate
   Board.
       3.19.8.1. The MO study analyst’s role includes an “honest broker” responsibility for identifying
       to Air Force senior leadership options to improve effective and efficient use of manpower
       resources.
44                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.19.8.2. In those cases where the sponsor is unwilling to pursue what otherwise appears to the
        MO analyst as a viable option, this should be internally documented for presentation separate from
        the sponsor’s position.
     3.19.9. Micro. Simply because the scope of this type of project is “small” does not mean that the
     opportunity research phase needs to be insignificant. Even for projects that focus on one process (or
     activity) and have a local impact, the environment (current or future) for that process still needs to be
     understood. Perform environmental scanning in either a team or subgroups to collect information
     about trends, factors, limitations, requirements, etc., which the To-Be design will need to address.
     Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify and understand the impact these environmental factors will
     have on the target process. Identify targets to research for improvement ideas. Internet, publications,
     interviews, site visits, past experience, and obvious intuitive improvements may be ways to generate
     ideas. The improvements options (improve, eliminate, divest) may or may not need to be formally
     documented for approval, based on the requirements of the study. The more coordination and
     approval required for the improvements, the more useful a formally documented options package will
     be. Implement, but still document any “quick wins” identified along the way.
     3.19.10. Mid-level. As the number of processes, amount of the overall organization, and/or the level
     of impact to the Air Force increases, so too may the detail in the Opportunity Research. More com-
     plex, cross-functional or cross-departmental issues or processes may require a deeper analysis of envi-
     ronmental issues, as well as more formalized benchmarking and information gathering. As research
     increases in formality, it becomes more critical to have useful, detailed cost and performance informa-
     tion available for comparison with a “target” benchmark. For example, if the environmental scan has
     indicated that Just-In-Time training will be necessary in the future, and you have selected the “best in
     class” organization at such training, comparative analysis will be difficult if you do not know the cost
     or method you currently use for providing your training. How much better are they than you are? How
     differently do they perform the process? This is important to know in order to adapt their method (vs
     adopting) to fit your context. More traditional benchmarking techniques may be necessary in
     Mid-Level projects, as will the formality of documentation of the improvement options. The number
     of improvement options and the method of presentation (scenarios, list of ideas, etc.) should be dis-
     cussed and dictated by the project sponsor. Because of the wider impact to other Air Force organiza-
     tions or a larger number of organizational processes being impacted, the Five Fronts need to be
     considered to identify indirect impacts or related issues arising from any changes.
     3.19.11. Macro. In an organization-wide (holistic) project, larger, more global factors will come into
     play in the environmental scanning step. Also, coordination and communication requirements will
     increase, emphasizing the usefulness in having stakeholders and other impacted organizations
     involved in the options development. This may be as simple as reviewing the proposals, or may be to
     the level of participating in the workshops or activities. For example, if the project scope is across an
     entire Air Force function, having appropriate process owners from across the MAJCOMs participate
     in workshops, analysis, research, or idea development increases the chance of buy-in and expands the
     pool of perspectives from which to draw new ideas. The outcome documents and findings from the
     Environmental Scan and SWOT analysis should be coordinated for review and feedback to all appro-
     priate stakeholders. For larger projects such as this, it is often useful to assign processes or dimensions
     of the organization (i.e., training and technology) to subgroups. These groups can environmentally
     scan, perform SWOT analysis, and research their respective area of interest. Of course, some cross
     flow of information will need to occur to ensure that each subgroup is aware of the assumptions and
     findings of other subgroups. Surveys, interviews, site visits, and formal/informal benchmarking tech-
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                 45


   niques may all be used to different levels to the project. Project timeline and resources will dictate the
   appropriate level of research. Final consideration to the Five Fronts should be given across all of the
   recommendations in order to address any issues that impact other organizational areas, policies, pro-
   grams, or other recommendations. Once research is complete, the improvement recommendations can
   be consolidated and coordinated for final review prior to presenting them to the sponsor. Considering
   the scope of the study, all improvement recommendations (including “quick wins”) should be for-
   mally documented. The number of improvement options and the method of presentation (scenarios,
   list of ideas, etc.) should be discussed with and dictated by the project sponsor.

Section 3F—To-Be Process Development--Phase 5

3.20. General Concepts. The outputs of the previous phase are improvement recommendations/options
presented to the project sponsor for some decision. Based on the intent and scope of the project, costs and
benefits associated with each option or recommendation will likely be presented. The project sponsor(s)
must make some decision as to which options should be developed into a detailed improvement plan to be
presented to the ultimate decision making authority. These selected process designs, short/long-term ini-
tiatives, or changes to current operations should satisfy the criteria for project success stated by the spon-
sor(s) in the Project Definition phase. When developed, the new design should also satisfy the customer
requirements in the current or future environment. If necessary for the project, the resources needed to
accomplish the newly designed processes (or tasks or activities) should be identified. Functional mea-
sures, which will be used to evaluate the “strength” of this new design, should also be designed.

3.21. Selection of Improvement Options. The project sponsor(s) should have criteria selected for
objectively evaluating the proposed options. The criteria may have been identified in the Project Defini-
tion Phase. Other criteria may be costly to implement, expected benefit to the organization, likelihood of
support from the boss, probability of implementing within a certain period of time, or any other rating he
or she thinks is useful. It is sometimes useful to group the options for selection. For example, creating cat-
egories for short/mid/long-term implementation may allow the sponsor to more easily select or prioritize
within those categories. In some cases, the sponsors may consider the criteria to be weighted differently.
If the number of improvement options is high, if the criteria are weighted differently, or if a number of
sponsors have to be involved in selection, decision-making software (groupware) can serve as a valuable
tool for speeding up the evaluation and selection process. If no such software is available, have the spon-
sor(s) rate each option on each criteria on a scale of 1 to 10. When creating a rating scale, having the raters
clearly understand, “What does a 1, 5 and 10 mean” becomes critically important to ensure consistency of
ratings. Take the time to do this right, or the ratings will be meaningless. Notice in the following example
how the prioritization order changes when the “Support” criteria was weighted twice as much as the other
criteria. Selection of an option or a collection of improvement proposals/initiatives constitutes a definition
of the strategy for the To-Be organization. The sponsor defines the direction, and the project team
assumes the responsibility of creating the detailed plan for bringing it to life. This plan will be coordinated
and presented to the final decision making authority for approval.

NOTE: This assumes the criteria are weighed equally. If they are not weighted equally (see the values in
parentheses), multiply the value in each cell by the weighting for that criteria and total.
     3.21.1. Creation of To-Be Design. Assuming that some changes will be accomplished, the project
     team (often referred to as Design Team(s) in this phase) must understand the performance and process
     gap between what currently exists and what will need to exist in the To-Be state. To build the To-Be
     design, team members will be required to re-familiarize themselves with the As-Is information to
     identify limitations, resources, and the current organization.
     3.21.2. Create To-Be Process/Activity Design. Using the information from opportunity research or
     improvement ideas that became obvious during the As-Is mapping of the processes, develop new pro-
     cess models. Many software programs exist to simulate process flow. This tool can serve as an out-
     standing method for performing “What if” scenarios. The As-Is data can be used as the baseline. Then
     To-Be improvement changes can be inserted into the model to evaluate the impact of changes on
     things like cycle time, manpower requirements, customer wait (queue) times, productivity, etc. Test
     sites of different process designs can also be set up to provide a more real world simulation of the pro-
     posed changes.
        3.21.2.1. During the creation of the To-Be state, critical attention needs to be paid to ensure that
        appropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts are involved. Lack of MAJCOM and/or union
        representation, for example, can cripple or halt the progress of a project of any size. Several
        schools of thought exist as to who should be involved in designing the new processes. One recom-
        mends that the ultimate process owners should design the system they will have to live with.
        Another argues that having new, more “novice” participants can provide more innovative designs,
        since they are less likely to be biased by past designs and paradigms. A good rule of thumb is to
        try to involve a little of both. Have process owners and stakeholders involved, since they know
        best the conditions and restrictions in which the new process will have to perform. Also include
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              47


     customers and outside “fresh eyes” to question any old school assumptions which may emerge,
     and to more easily provide an “outside the box” perspective. Perhaps representatives from one of
     the benchmark target organizations can participate to provide lessons learned or quick fixes to
     design problems that may arise.
     3.21.2.2. Remember to resist the urge to “adopt” techniques or tools identified in the Opportunity
     Research phase. No two organizations are the same. Simply introducing telecommuting, peer rat-
     ings, team-based design, technology insertion, decentralized decision-making or many other
     improvements without considering the unique cultural in the receiving organization can lead to
     failure. To re-emphasize: Adapt, don’t adopt opportunity research findings.
     3.21.2.3. Divesting or eliminating processes, activities, or steps in the To-Be design is often not as
     simple as just making the changes. For projects that impact other organizations or departments,
     some coordination will need to take place to ensure that these changes do not negatively impact
     stakeholders. If, for example, the Air Force Corporate Board will be the approving authority of the
     proposed To-Be design, coordination and agreement between impacted agencies may need to be
     demonstrated. Some eliminated activities may be internal or obvious enough to not require such
     coordination.
  3.21.3. Define Interaction of Change Initiatives Across the Five Fronts. Whether the change proposal
  is a process change, elimination/divestiture of activities, or an initiative that cuts across a number of
  processes, other areas of the organization will likely be impacted. The interrelation of facilities, poli-
  cies/guidance, technology, personnel, and process factors needs to be addressed to identify what sup-
  port factors, for example, will need to change as a result of a process modification. Perhaps career
  development courses (CDC) will need to be revised, new software will be required, just-in-time train-
  ing will be introduced, and recruitment criteria will need to be adjusted to support a process change. A
  workshop environment may be an ideal place to list such supporting requirements relative to each
  change proposal. A timeline with OPRs and completion dates can be created to help manage these
  activities. It should be obvious how important proper workshop planning becomes in order to ensure
  representation by appropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts. Union representation may be a
  very important stakeholder to have involved in this process, when appropriate.
     3.21.3.1. Define New System Requirements. The more detail that can be added to the To-Be orga-
     nization, the better. Have the Design Team(s) specify skill levels necessary to perform the new
     activities or processes. They should also document any software or technology requirements for
     the To-Be design. This will assist in establishing the cost of the new system, and will facilitate
     procurement and implementation.
     3.21.3.2. Workload Resource Impacts. Any changes to processes/activities will likely impact
     workload, and ultimately the manpower authorized to the organization. Typically, if the process
     changes are significant, establishing the manpower costs becomes harder. The more mid/
     long-term the proposed changes/initiatives, the more difficult it becomes to objectively measure
     the manpower savings/costs. The proposed manpower requirement becomes “notional,” and
     should be based on realistic estimates developed from either a simulation model (see paragraph
     3.28.3.6.), practical experience, or from opportunity research.
     3.21.3.3. Other Costs. Other resource costs (facilities, technology, etc.) may also be of interest to
     understand and present the To-Be design costs. ABC provides one method for documenting and
     assigning such costs to process activities.
48                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.21.3.4. Changes in Manpower Requirements. Define the changes in manpower requirements
        resulting from the improvement recommendations. This delta would be based on the To-Be esti-
        mate minus the As-Is manpower required to perform the event. If detailed As-Is manpower data is
        available, this process will be easier. If none exists or the Team did a higher level costing
        approach, then more detailed As-Is manpower data may need to be collected at this time. If neces-
        sary a formal “notional manpower standard” may need to be developed to outline for the final
        approving authority the processes which will be performed in the future and the manpower “cost”
        associated with that service. Some political consideration should be made for how to present any
        costs or savings. For example, there will often be a transition period when implementing the
        To-Be design, during which any manpower savings offered for the To-Be design would not be
        available. If the authorizations are taken off the UMD(s) when the proposed savings are presented,
        the organization will be without necessary manpower during the transition period. A phased
        approach to adjusting manpower or other resources maybe safer and a more realistic way to ensure
        that an organization is able to survive the transition. As discussed, many aspects associated with
        the change must be considered to develop the best transition plan, not least of which is the impact
        on the people (both military and civilian) who would be affected by the change. Some improve-
        ment recommendations, on the other hand, may lend themselves to immediate adjustment in
        resources. The sponsor, supported by the study team, briefs the To-Be proposal to the Air Force
        Corporate Structure and makes the appropriate recommendation.
     3.21.4. Document New Design. The new design should be documented in a manner that is appropri-
     ate for the project. Larger projects will require a more formal proposal and plan to be developed for
     coordination and approval. Extremely small projects may only require a briefing and verbal approval.
     Just as in the Project Definition and Planning Phases, it was important that everyone understood the
     case for change, scope of the project, and roles/responsibilities. Now it is critical that everyone under-
     stands how the To-Be organization is being proposed to work. A concept of operations often serves
     this purpose, outlining the organizational layout, process designs, and roles and responsibilities of the
     workers in the newly proposed process. It defines “Who does what to whom,” and can be as detailed
     as is reasonable for the project. A simulation model may also serve as a way of articulating the new
     design.
        3.21.4.1. If of interest to the sponsor or the decision making authority, the Implementation Plan
        can also be developed at this time, outlining key initiatives, actions, OPRs, completion dates, and
        an overall timeline. As was stated earlier, since the To-Be state does not exist yet, and the To-Be
        design was based to some degree on speculation and assumption, a phased implementation
        approach may be appropriate to allow for appropriate adjustments during implementation. Pilot
        test sites or incremental implementation can serve as this type of “Proof of Concept.” In some
        cases, there will be recruitment or budgeting lag or a learning curve, which this type of phased
        approach can absorb.
        3.21.4.2. Create measures for evaluating the To-Be organization. So often, organizations do not
        have a well-designed measurement program. Measures and metrics frequently exist which provide
        no real information, and are simply being collected because, “We’ve always measured it.” This
        phase allows the perfect opportunity for an organization to articulate “What must go right” in
        order for the organization to survive and be successful. This may be broken down into dimensions
        of performance such as “Mission”/“Customer” (effectiveness), “Processes” (efficiency), “Peo-
        ple,” “Finances,” etc. The sponsor can articulate goals as to what has to happen in each of these
        dimensions. Measures are then identified which would give proof of whether or not the goals were
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                               49


     being reached. Finally, some method of collection, calculation, data storage, frequency, display,
     and communication of these measures would need to be defined, with an OPR for each measure.
     A wealth of performance measurement literature and approaches exists which can help in the
     development of such a measurement system. Such measures help future leaders make fact-based
     decisions regarding the “health” of their organization or process.
  3.21.5. Micro. Even a narrow-scoped process requires the sponsor to make a decision about the strat-
  egy for the To-Be. Considering the breadth of impact is relatively small, and the coordination/
  approval requirement is lower, deciding and moving forward with the selected option(s) is stream-
  lined. The To-Be design, whether it is a process or activity, may be created “on the fly” by testing dif-
  ferent proposed solutions. For example, an Action Work Out can be considered a Micro-scoped
  project. This technique conducts the Opportunity Research and To-Be design almost simultaneously
  by physically testing new physical or process designs for improvement as the ideas emerge. In some
  projects, the improvement ideas or initiatives may require more planning or design, necessitating
  flowcharting, simulation, or other formal design techniques. Even single process or activity improve-
  ments can significantly impact other factors of the organization, so evaluation of the Five Fronts may
  still be appropriate. Due to the reduced coordination/approval requirement, documentation of the new
  design and the resource impacts (manpower, facilities, etc.) may not need to be formally presented to
  the ultimate decision maker. If unsure, it is always better to err on the side of too much documentation
  and justification for proposals. If appropriate, manpower changes may be captured as a variance, if the
  change is not Air Force-wide. An implementation plan may also be informal, still ensuring that all
  impacted parties understand the proposal, design, and roles/responsibilities in the To-Be design. Pro-
  cess and activity measures can easily be developed and defined to ensure they are collected and dis-
  played in a useful manner.
  3.21.6. Mid-level. The To-Be design may impact more organizations and stakeholders, so buy-in for
  the new design is more critical. Upon selecting the strategy (option or collection of improvement ini-
  tiatives), the project sponsor will articulate what the To-Be vision of the organization is. This will pro-
  vide some clarity on what the Design Teams should develop, and will provide boundaries on how the
  To-Be data should be presented for approval by the decision-making authority. Change initiatives
  should be assigned to the Design Team or Teams for development. The team(s) may wish to conduct
  workshops to create new designs or propose the plan to eliminate/divest selected activities. If appro-
  priate, the new organizational structure should be defined, processes should be flowcharted or mod-
  eled, and resource impacts should be estimated. Encourage stakeholders to participate or review
  design ideas for buy-in and innovation purposes. If technology insertion is involved, requirements for
  that technology should be defined. The Five Fronts should be formally considered for each improve-
  ment idea, with a final review of issues, which may cut across a number of processes. If the project
  spans across many departments, bases, MAJCOMs, etc., ensure that assumptions and design propos-
  als are being communicated as appropriate. As more processes and initiatives are impacted by change,
  there will likely be a manpower impact. A mid-level scoped project may require the ultimate approv-
  ing authority to be more senior, thus requiring more detailed data on cost. If the costing detail from the
  As-Is Phase was very high level, it may be necessary to measure in more detail the As-Is cost now that
  the improvement targets have been identified. This will allow for more sound estimates of To-Be
  costs. Improvement initiatives can be described by their implementation time (e.g., short term/long
  term improvements). Longer-term improvements will require more notional estimates of both costs
  and benefits, and may require a phased implementation. A more formal Concept of Operations and
  Implementation Plan will likely be necessary to ensure that the wider scope of the organization
50                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     impacted by the changes understands the proposals and their responsibilities in the To-Be state.
     Finally, with input from the sponsor, the Design Team can define and develop the performance mea-
     sures which will measure the health of the To-Be organization. Dimensions of performance can be
     defined, as described above, and performance goals regarding “What must happen” in the respective
     dimension can be articulated. Process owners are often great participants in the activity of identifying
     the few measures which demonstrate accomplishment of the goals.
     3.21.7. Macro. High coordination/communication will require the change initiatives to be more for-
     mally documented. Even “quick wins” should be captured, especially if they impact other processes
     or will be expected to be implemented at other locations. The project sponsor(s) will still need to
     establish criteria for selecting options or change initiatives. Due to the larger scope, they may wish to
     organize the change proposals into short-term/mid-term/long-term activities, to allow the ultimate
     decision-making authority to consider the budgeting cycle and a phased implementation. The
     macro-scoped project also impacts a greater portion of the organization which increases the impor-
     tance of having representatives from all appropriate areas of the organization participate in the Design
     Teams. These experts will provide valuable data for estimating firm and notional manpower, support,
     and other appropriate costs associated with the changes. ABC and simulation modeling are valuable
     techniques for rigorously creating such information. The process/activity/initiative designs must con-
     sider the Five Fronts, since a project of this scale will likely have a ripple effect and impact many pro-
     cesses and organizations for every change that is made. Large, organizational proposals, such as
     changes to career field progression, modification of policy and guidance, and standardization of
     equipment will likely emerge, and must be addressed and managed. The Concept of Operations and
     Implementation Plan should also be developed with appropriate representation from across the appro-
     priate divisions, functions, MAJCOMs, departments, etc. Buy-in is critical to moving the proposed
     To-Be design forward. The sponsor should have an idea of the necessary format, concerns, partici-
     pants, and time frame which will increase the likelihood of approval by the ultimate decision-making
     authority. Finally, the Design Team should take the time to identify the Performance Measures by
     which the To-Be organization can be monitored. These measures would be separate from measures
     simply depicting the progress of implementation. The measures developed for the To-Be organization
     should be a “Scorecard” by which the To-Be leaders can monitor how well the organization is doing
     what needs to be done in order to accomplish its “mission.” If the project organization has Mission
     Essential Tasks, some of these measures should directly reflect the Performance Measures it identified
     for the “Assess” phase of Functional Management. Other measures may also be necessary to monitor
     the internal efficiency of the organization outside what the Performance Management framework
     requires.

3.22. Process Oriented Description (POD) Development.
     3.22.1. General Concepts. The POD is a full description of processes that are the responsibility of the
     work center. A process is a series of value-added actions that bring about an end or result. If a POD
     does not exist, develop one from process analysis worksheets, mission statements, and/or the applica-
     ble directives that govern the function and define work requirements. The POD is the basic building
     block of a standard and is written to facilitate work measurement and data analysis and computations.
     Functional characteristics, such as complexity, stability, and degree of standardization influence the
     level of POD detail, the selection of the measurement approach, and the ultimate maintenance of the
     standard.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                               51


  3.22.2. Definition of Work Center Process Steps. Make sure POD content reflects only mis-
  sion-essential processes assigned to the work center being studied that are governed by a MAJCOM
  directive or higher. Omit assumed or inferred workload. Inferred work is work that is the responsibil-
  ity of another work center or function. Assumed work is considered nice-to-do but is not necessary to
  work center productivity. Inferred and assumed work are not given manpower credit to the work cen-
  ter under study. To build a good POD, develop an accurate and understandable definition for each pro-
  cess step.
     3.22.2.1. A process is a discrete segment of work activities that represents a composite of meth-
     ods, procedures, and techniques needed to accomplish one unit of work activity (output). It is a
     procedure with a definitive input and output product. This facilitates price identification and
     examination of various levels of service options. A process involves worker interaction with such
     things as equipment, material, other people, and information. In most instances, the performance
     of a process by a worker has a definite beginning and end.
     3.22.2.2. A process definition may only need a short phrase (for example, repairs carburetor), or
     it may need a breakout of the process into several steps (for example, disassembles carburetor,
     replaces part, reassembles carburetor, and inspects carburetor). Factors that influence the degree
     of definition detail needed are:
  3.22.3. The Nature of the Activity.
     3.22.3.1. A detailed process definition is suitable when an operation is highly repetitive and a spe-
     cific sequence of steps must be followed.
     3.22.3.2. A less detailed listing of a process is suitable when a process can be done in a variety of
     ways. For example, management, research, and problem-solving activities may follow different
     steps each time they are done; therefore, they can only be described in general terms.
     3.22.3.3. Structure processes so they are independent and mutually exclusive of each other and
     have definite beginning and ending points.
  3.22.4. The work measurement method selected:
     3.22.4.1. A measurement method such as operational audit usually needs processes defined at the
     step level to ensure accuracy of data.
     3.22.4.2. For work sampling, the sampling level dictates the degree of detail needed. If sampling
     is done at the process level, a listing of step titles or a grouping of the steps in sentence format may
     provide enough detail for measurement.
     3.22.4.3. In all cases, clearly write process definitions in enough detail so the measuring techni-
     cian can easily identify when an activity occurs during measurement.
     3.22.4.4. Setting up the correct process definition detail is a repetitive procedure requiring the
     manpower and organizational technician to use good judgment and common sense. Each work
     center produces different definition requirements that must be addressed to obtain accurate data.
     During this procedure, remember:
         3.22.4.4.1. Steps made purposely broad to cover as much work as possible can increase inter-
         pretation problems, cause inaccurate measurement, and hinder data analysis.
52                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


            3.22.4.4.2. Steps that do not accurately reflect duties and responsibilities increase the chance
            for inaccurate measurement.
            3.22.4.4.3. Steps that are too detailed may result in an indiscernible sequence of events.
     3.22.5. Classifying Work Center Activities. When analyzing individual work center activities, decide
     if they are productive, nonavailable, assumed work, or not allowed. Use Table 3.2. to do this analysis.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                                                 53

NOTES:
1. Ensure credit for travel is not double-counted in the steps or processes identified. When the modular equation or
process oriented approach is used, split travel between the appropriate modules or processes.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                                55


2. Indirect tasks can be reflected as both direct or indirect in Management or overhead work centers. However, when
documented as direct work, the processes reflect steps to support personnel in subordinate work centers while the
indirect categories reflect steps to support people inside the overhead work center. Ensure that direct processes are
written clearly and do not duplicate indirect work described in AFMS 00AA.
3. There may be other duties performed by work center personnel, e.g., snow/ice removal, that may or may not be
creditable to the work center. In all cases, use the decision logic table (Table 3.2.) to determine how this work should
be classified.

   3.22.6. Nonavailable Work Center Activities.
        3.22.6.1. When identifying and defining processes done in a work center, there are activities that
        are directed, approved, or recognized by the Air Force that makes people unavailable for assigned
        primary processes. Since these activities have an impact on all work centers, they have been mea-
        sured Air Force-wide and subtracted from each person’s assigned time to produce the man-hour
        availability factors (MAF). MAFs are listed in AFI 38-201.
        3.22.6.2. The major groupings of nonavailable activities for military personnel are leave, perma-
        nent change of station (PCS)-related, medical, organizational duties, education and training, and
        miscellaneous. Specific definitions of each follow:
             3.22.6.2.1. Leave. This refers to an approved absence from work or duty for a specified period
             of time. It does not include leave taken in conjunction with a PCS move or convalescent leave.
             Personnel on leave in conjunction with a PCS move are assigned against authorizations in the
             Air Force Transient Account.
             3.22.6.2.2. PCS-Related. This refers to activities done by personnel because of a PCS move.

             (MPF), Financial Management, Transportation, Officer or NCO Club, Base Housing, Supply,
             Library, Post Office, and others as established by MAJCOMs. PCS-related also includes activ-
             ities needed for family settlement such as home sale, quarters inspection, closing utility
             accounts and supervision of movers. Authorized time to and from port to pick up or ship your
             privately owned vehicle (POV) in conjunction with a PCS move is included. It does not
             include travel and leave taken in connection with the PCS move. Personnel on leave or travel-
             ing in conjunction with a PCS move are assigned against authorizations in the Air Force Tran-
             sient Account.
             3.22.6.2.3. Medical. An approved absence from duty for medical reasons such as inpatient
             and quarters stays, outpatient visits, immunizations, dental visits, and Alcohol and Drug
             Abuse Prevention and Treatment program entrants.
             3.22.6.2.4. Organizational Duties. These include activities such as:

     ian personnel are leave and training.
        3.22.6.2.5.6.1. Leave. This refers to an approved absence from work or duty for a
        specified period of time. This includes annual leave, sick leave, and special absences.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                           57


                    3.22.6.2.5.6.1.1. Annual Leave. Employees are granted leave to allow time off for
                    vacations and for personal and emergency purposes.
                    3.22.6.2.5.6.1.2. Sick Leave. Sick leave is a qualified right of the employee and
                    may be used only for the following absences: (1) when incapacitated for perfor-
                    mance of duty by sickness, injury, pregnancy, or illness resulting from immuniza-
                    tions or vaccinations; (2) for medical, dental, or optical examinations or treatment;
                    and (3) to participate in drug or alcohol counseling programs. Additionally, the
                    Family Friendly Leave Act allows sick leave to be used to care for a family mem-
                    ber with an illness, injury, or a dental, medical, or optical examination/treatment
                    and to make arrangements for or to attend the funeral of a family member.

                    hours that are administratively authorized without loss of pay and without charge
                    to leave. These absences are described in a minimum of two publications:
                       3.22.6.2.5.6.1.3.1. AFI 36-701, Labor Management Relations.
                       3.22.6.2.5.6.1.3.2. Federal Personnel Manual, Supplement 990-2, Sub-chapter
                       11, Excused Absences.
                3.22.6.2.5.6.2. Training. Includes time for formal and recurring training.
                    3.22.6.2.5.6.2.1. Formal Training. This includes all formal classroom training of
                    eight hours duration or longer that is recorded on an individual’s master personnel
                    record. It excludes OJT, but includes courses given on base that meet the formal
                    eight-hour criteria.
                    3.22.6.2.5.6.2.2. Recurring Training. This includes any training that is of an ancil-
                    lary or mandatory nature required to ensure Air Force civilian personnel possess an
                    adequate blend of both general and technical knowledge and capabilities. Some
                    examples of recurring training are operations security (OPSEC), communications
                    security (COMSEC), base orientation briefings, and supervisor's safety training.
            3.22.6.2.5.7. Operational Audit. Nonavailable activities are not measured during an oper-
            ational audit (OA) study because they are accounted for in the MAFs. Work sampling
            accounts for all man-hours including nonavailable activities; however, the resulting non-
            available man-hours are subtracted and not used in the man-hour equation.
            3.22.6.2.5.8. POD. Nonavailable activities are not put in the POD.
            3.22.6.2.5.9. Additional Information. For more information about nonavailable activities
            addressed in the MAF, see copies of military and civilian man-hour availability studies
            distributed to all manpower organizations by AFMIA.
  3.22.7. Preparation of the POD.
     3.22.7.1. Clearly state process titles and accurately describe the steps that are grouped under
     them. Use a noun form or an adjective and a noun form (for example, management, minor mainte-
     nance, officer classification, record processing). Make the process titles descriptive and easily
     identifiable.
58                                                               AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     3.22.7.2. State step titles in a single unit form with verbs in third person singular. Processes will
     be described at the step level only (e.g., 1.1., 1.2., 2.3., etc.). In work sampling measurement, pro-
     cesses will be described to the level necessary for accurate measurement. In either case, each
     definitive step of the process, from the beginning (input) to the end (output), will be described in
     the sequence that it occurs in the process. This increases the chances of getting accurate unit times
     and frequencies at the time of measurement. Titles that are vague or written in plural form increase
     the chance of error in the associated unit time values and may make later analysis of data harder.
     The same step title may be used in different processes. For example, "Reviews UMD" could be a
     step in processing a manpower authorization change request or in the process of applying a man-
     power standard. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable step titles are listed below.


          ACCEPTABLE                       UNACCEPTABLE


          Types letter                    Type letters

          Takes sample                    Take samples

     3.22.7.3. Including an indirect statement in the POD is optional. If it is included, use the following
     statement: INDIRECT: Indirect work involves those tasks that are not readily identifiable with the
     work center’s specific product or service. The major categories of standard indirect work are:
     Administers Civilian, Officer, and Enlisted Personnel; Directs Work Center Activity; Provides
     Administrative Support; Prepares for and Conducts/Attends Meeting; Administers Training; Man-
     ages Supplies; Maintains Equipment; and Performs Cleanup. See AFMS 00AA, Standard Indirect
     Description.
     3.22.7.4. Format the POD using the AFMIA home page, Air Force Manpower Standards, Tech
     Guidance and Forms, Air Force Manpower Standards Publishing Guide. See below for examples
     of POD formats.

3.23. Workload Factor Identification.
   3.23.1. General Concepts. The standard workload factor (WLF) is the factor selected to predict a
   function’s manpower requirement for various workload volumes. Selection of the WLF begins with
   the identification of potential workload factors (PWLF) during study planning and measurement
   activities. The identification of PWLFs begins with work unit (WU) identification. WUs are the quan-
   tifiable outputs of work activities or processes, e.g., an engine repaired. The selected WLF may be a
   WU, if its volume is not controlled by the function (external WLF), e.g., square feet of floor space
   maintained. The WLF will also be programmable, or must describe workload not under the control of
   the function being studied. Programmable workload factors include (1) base population, (2) number
   of authorized aircraft, space based systems supported, or vehicles supported, (3) mission design
   series, (4) flying hours, and (5) students. Obtain waivers to these criteria from HQ USAF/XPM.
   3.23.2. Identifying Work Units (WUs). Study the functional structure to identify significant processes
   and the output products or units of production. The main purpose of this step is to set the stage for
   picking PWLFs.
       3.23.2.1. Where feasible, identify work units for each defined work activity or process that allows
       a good look at like-activity time variances during analysis and computations.
       3.23.2.2. To be of maximum utility, work units should be:
           3.23.2.2.1. Directly related to the time and effort spent on the associated activity.
           3.23.2.2.2. Economical and convenient to report and use.
           3.23.2.2.3. Mutually exclusive, so that no item is counted under more than one work unit.
           3.23.2.2.4. Open to audit, so that the accuracy of a work count is readily verified through set-
           ting up a work count system or through existing internal work measurement programs or man-
           agement information systems.
           3.23.2.2.5. Readily understood by those who plan, schedule, and control the work.
           3.23.2.2.6. Readily identifiable when seen produced.
62                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


            3.23.2.2.7. Individually standardized in terms of the procedures needed for accomplishment.
        3.23.2.3. Depending on the established or intended use of the work unit, each of the above
        attributes assumes a varying degree of importance. The most important characteristic of a work
        unit is that it must define a specific amount of work. Vague work unit titles should be avoided.
        3.23.2.4. WUs can be used as WLFs in ratio type standards and are normally reserved for single
        location or small population standards. They are not used in standards unless they are programma-
        ble, or not under control of the function (external WLF).
     3.23.3. Identifying Potential Workload Factors. An ideal workload factor has two significant
     attributes:
        3.23.3.1. It relates to manpower requirements to the extent that any change in the value of the fac-
        tor produces a corresponding change in the man-hours needed to do the work.
        3.23.3.2. The value of the factor can be predicted for future time periods to make the standard use-
        ful as a forecasting tool.
     3.23.4. Relatability and Predictability. The relative importance of these two attributes –relatability
     and predictability - can be debated. But, if a stated manpower requirement is based on a workload fac-
     tor that does not relate to that requirement, then a standard manpower relationship does not exist. As a
     result, standard predictability and credibility are undermined.
     3.23.5. Identifying Relatability and Predictability. Identify the predictability of a factor by studying
     the available program information. Relatability presents a more difficult problem because accurate
     data for correlation analysis is rarely available this early in the study. For this reason, the best work-
     load factors are normally identified only after measurement. The selection problem is compounded by
     the relationship that often exists between accuracy and programmability. With a highly finite, pre-
     cisely defined unit, there is a high probability of correlation, but the chance of predicting the future
     workload volume is usually small. As the definition of the unit is broadened, the chance of accurately
     predicting the future volume increases, but the chances of getting an acceptable degree of correlation
     goes down.
     3.23.6. Determining Relationships. The problem in determining relationships between workload and
     man-hours is less where there are existing resource management systems, output measurement pro-
     grams, or management information systems. This information can help M&O personnel select work-
     load factors.
     3.23.7. Procedures for Identifying Potential Workload Factors. Workload factors should be both
     accurate and programmable. Factors that are also used for programming are preferred over those that
     are not. If there is a significant difference in relatability, do not give up accuracy for programmability
     in setting the basic standard. When it is needed, a separate equation can be built for programming the
     manpower requirements. Identify potential workload factors for measurement using these procedures:
        3.23.7.1. First, identify WUs not controlled by the function.
        3.23.7.2. Second, from these WUs, identify those that are associated with major manpower con-
        suming activities or processes.
        3.23.7.3. Third, identify factors that are not WUs, e.g., base population.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              63


     3.23.7.4. Finally, eliminate factors that are not readily identifiable or easily counted. Counts of the
     PWLFs and other WUs can be made during familiarization or measurement.
  3.23.8. Use Accurate Terms. Use terms that give actual experience, and not programmable workload,
  when making the final list of PWLFs. For example, use assigned strength (not authorized strength) for
  population factors; and hours flown (not hours programmed) for flying hour factors; or munitions
  stored, not storage capacity. Get actual workload experience for both man-hours and workloads to see
  if a true relationship exists.
  3.23.9. Get the following information for each PWLF picked through the above process. The same
  format applies to work units.
     3.23.9.1. Title. Identify briefly what is to be counted. Use singular form--i.e., "A Vehicle
     Repaired"--not "Vehicles repaired."
     3.23.9.2. Definition. Define, in precise terms, the count and tell what is to be included in or
     excluded from the count. Vague definitions are not acceptable. For example, if "Population
     Served" is the workload factor, it must be clear whether the count includes tenants, on-base popu-
     lation, off-base population, transients, Reserves, National Guard, Individual Mobilization Aug-
     mentees, etc.
     3.23.9.3. Source and Method of Count. Identify the source from which the count is to be obtained.
     This includes the report number and title and column number or title. Include the date or edition of
     the report since the format of the source might change.
     3.23.9.4. Rationale. Include the reasons for selecting work units or workload factors. Tell how
     and why the selected work units or workload factors are expected to relate to the measured
     man-hours.
     3.23.9.5. Method of Verification. Identify the source used to verify the data included in the pri-
     mary source of count. This includes multiples of sources used to derive the cumulative count doc-
     umented in the primary source.
  3.23.10. Program Terminology. After selecting the standard WLF in later study phases, revise the
  preceding to show program terminology when pertinent. For example:
     3.23.10.1. Build Manpower Standards Using Actual Workload Factor Counts. Manpower stan-
     dards using actual measured man-hours must be built on actual workload factor counts, e.g.,
     assigned personnel or assigned vehicles, not authorized or required quantities. Authorizations or
     requirements do not produce work and are not logically relatable to actual measured man-hours.
     3.23.10.2. If the selected workload factor title is "A Student Trained in the Manpower & Organi-
     zation Course," the workload factor title for the standard might be "A Student Programmed to be
     Trained in the Manpower & Organization Course."
     3.23.10.3. If the selected workload factor title is "A Person Assigned to Base Supply," the work-
     load factor title for the standard might be "A Base Supply Person Required After Application of
     Base Supply Manpower Standards," or "A Base Supply Authorization." Do not revise workload
     factor titles based on population to Requirements in the UMD, since they may include active
     reserve forces, individual mobilization augmentees, and authorizations earned as a result of
     host-tenant support agreements.
  3.23.11. Planning a Work Count System:
64                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.23.11.1. Make a list of WUs and PWLFs needed for a work count.
        3.23.11.2. Find out which of those items are adequately reported by existing management report-
        ing or information systems.
        3.23.11.3. See if the existing instructions are being followed IAW with functional OPR directives.
        Local compliance with reporting instructions is essential if using existing systems.
        3.23.11.4. See whether or not the items needed are reported in defined form and for compatible
        time periods. If the reported information differs only slightly from what is needed, consider work-
        ing with the OPR to decide if it is more economical to change the existing report or redefine the
        items reported. Do not set up additional systems unless it is essential to standards development.
        3.23.11.5. Use the following to get usable and accurate work counts:
            3.23.11.5.1. Show clearly what is a unit of count.
            3.23.11.5.2. Set up the source of count, or the point in a process, at which a unit of count
            results.
            3.23.11.5.3. Make sure that the length of count reporting is compatible with, or adjustable to,
            the measurement period’s anticipated length. This is especially important if the work sampling
            method is used.
            3.23.11.5.4. Set up safeguards that minimize the possibility of a duplicated or missed count.
            An example is a random external audit of the workload reports.
            3.23.11.5.5. When possible, have the work count procedures call for a minimum of six months
            historical data. This historical information is of value later in the computation phase when rep-
            resentativeness of the measurement period is evaluated.
     3.23.12. Potential Equivalent Workload Factors. Consider the use of equivalent WLFs if they are suit-
     able for the work center.
        3.23.12.1. An equivalent WLF is used to get a count for similar work that has different per accom-
        plishment times (PAT). For example, the WLF "vehicle maintained" may have equivalents for
        preventative maintenance on a sedan or on a truck.
        3.23.12.2. When this kind of WLF is used, a baseline output is valued at one, (in this case the
        sedan is given a 1.0) and the other outputs are valued in relation to this baseline (for example, the
        truck could be given a 1.2).
        3.23.12.3. The total WLF count is obtained by adding all equivalents (for example, (10 X 1.0) +
        (5 X 1.2) = 16.0).
        3.23.12.4. Identify potential equivalent WLFs early in a study. Then design data collection to
        allow validation of equivalent values. Work measurement results should support relative values.
        In the vehicle example, measurement data shows 20 percent more man-hours needed to service a
        truck than a sedan. Remember, the time value in your measurement (PAT) must be the same for all
        vehicles used in the equivalent, and it must be equal to the baseline output (in this case the sedan).
        This is necessary because you are adjusting the workload factor value to compensate for the differ-
        ences in time needed to service the sedan and the truck.

3.24. Measurement Design.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                          65


  3.24.1. General Concepts. Measurement design is a coordinated effort needing full participation and
  teamwork from all levels. Once you’ve selected your measurement approach you can begin to prepare
  for measurement. There are many different techniques available for collecting data. However, there
  are really only two approaches: (1) workshop measurement and (2) field measurement. Regardless of
  the approach selected, some form of study plan is required. A workshop approach may require a less
  detailed one, but will require an extensive familiarization package for the workshop attendees. On the
  other hand, field measurement will require a very detailed study plan because persons other than
  project team members (for example, manpower technicians at other locations) may be conducting the
  actual data collection or measurement.
  3.24.2. Major Activities. Following are some major design activities. Depending on the approach,
  some or all may be required.
     3.24.2.1. Briefing study background and planned approach with functional OPR.
     3.24.2.2. Identifying project team members from M&O and functional communities.
     3.24.2.3. Conducting a comprehensive review of work processes and activities. Identifying
     improvement initiatives and work outputs.
     3.24.2.4. Identifying potential variances (mission, technological, or environmental).
     3.24.2.5. Identifying test measurement or preworkshop visit locations.
     3.24.2.6. Briefing local OPRs at test measurement or preworkshop visit sites on study back-
     ground, approach and needs, and collecting data.
     3.24.2.7. Developing the final detailed study plan to include data collection instructions.
     3.24.2.8. Notifying the Chief, Civilian Personnel Flight to inform union officials of study
     progress, if the study involves civilian positions or processes.
  3.24.3. Measurement Plan and Input Team Measurement Instructions.
     3.24.3.1. Part One - Measurement Plan.
         3.24.3.1.1. Field measurement will be the exception. If the project team chooses this
         approach, instead of conducting a workshop, they must develop a formal measurement plan. If
         they developed the study plan, they may use the process described below for measurement
         plan development (see Figure 3.14.).
         3.24.3.1.2. The project team should conduct a test measurement to determine the validity of
         the test measurement plan. After test measurement, the project team updates the measurement
         design based on test measurement results. Part One of the study plan becomes Part One of the
         measurement plan. The team sends it to the input teams and affected MAJCOMs. (NLT two
         weeks before work measurement).
     3.24.3.2. Part Two - Input Team Measurement Instructions. The measurement instructions and
     POD in this part represent the heart of the measurement plan. Section A of the measurement plan
     is general information, which is common to all work centers being measured. The remaining sec-
     tions contain specific measurement instructions for each work center. For example, if three work
     centers are being measured, include sections B, C, and D (one for each). If measuring only one,
     don’t divide Part Two into sections; however, include each applicable topic shown in Figure 3.14.
66                                                              AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


          3.24.3.2.1. Section A - General Information. Give clear and concise measurement instructions
          to input teams. Do not merely repeat information from this manual. Tell them how to measure
          the function.
              3.24.3.2.1.1. Work Sampling. Address familiarization sampling, backlogged work, bor-
              rowed and loaned man-hours, start and stop days for sampling, usable sampling days
              needed, stratified-by-hour or random-by-day sampling, sampling lunch, nonavailable
              time, nonproductive time and special processes, treatment of travel, indirect categories,
              absences from the work area, work not done during the sampling period, assumed or
              inferred work, collocated work centers, shifts or sections having fewer than five people
              assigned, sampling days falling outside control limits, and supplementary measurement
              method used and the processes or steps that will be measured by this method.

AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                          67


          3.24.3.2.1.2. Operational Audit (OA). State the technique to measure frequencies and
          per-accomplishment times. Relate frequencies to work unit counts where possible. An
          interview worksheet may be used for collecting OA data instead of a preprinted AF Form
          1040, Operational Audit Data (see AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2). If used, interview work-
          sheets should include information necessary for the input teams to collect and verify data,
          and for the study or input team to input data directly into the computer. Furnish benchmark
          times and data ranges when available.
          3.24.3.2.1.3. Workload Data Collection. Include only general workload collection instruc-
          tions that pertain to all work centers being measured in this section. Put specific workload
          collection instructions in Attachment 1 to the measurement plan.
          3.24.3.2.1.4. Standard Indirect Allowed Man-hours (SIAM). State which SIAM task time
          values will be used for operational audits and indicate which indirect tasks will be mea-
          sured. Instruct field measurement sites to use the measurement instructions furnished in
          AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, for measuring these indirect tasks.
          3.24.3.2.1.5. Strength Data. State the need for current or historical authorized and
          assigned strength data. This data may be needed for a potential workload factor (PWLF) in
          a work center, for comparison against measured requirements, or analyzing changing
          workload. See paragraph 3.23. for further information regarding PWLFs.
          3.24.3.2.1.6. Skill and Grade Instructions. List the data necessary for the project team to
          do skill and grade analysis for completion of the manpower table. Tell the input teams to
          collect skill and grade data for inclusion in the measurement report.
       3.24.3.2.2. Section B - Specific Information (by Work Center). This section is for each spe-
       cific work center. For example, if three work centers are being measured, include a section B,
       C, and D (one for each).
          3.24.3.2.2.1. POD. Prepare PODs according to instructions in paragraph 3.22.
          3.24.3.2.2.2. Statement of Conditions (SOC). The SOC paragraph describes, in general
          terms, conditions which bear on development or application of the manpower standard.
          The SOC will later be used in preparation of the manpower standard. Include key assump-
          tions and major decisions on modes of operation not described in the POD. It is also the
          baseline against which potential variances are analyzed. The SOC in the standard describes
          the general conditions that are incorporated into the standard. Some condition classes
          which could impact a work center are:
              3.24.3.2.2.2.1. Climatic Conditions. This condition covers those naturally occurring
              atmospheric conditions that affect the work. For example, extreme temperatures may
              affect the work, by snowfall, or by the corrosive effect of rain and humidity.
              3.24.3.2.2.2.2. Physical Layout of Facilities. This condition highlights facility layout
              situations that affect the work. Among the items looked at are the degree of consolida-
              tion of the work center and how the work is affected by the organization of people,
              equipment, and workflow.
              3.24.3.2.2.2.3. Physical Condition of Facilities. This condition describes physical con-
              ditions of the facilities that affect work. While all work centers are indirectly affected
              by conditions in this class, you will find that some work centers such as laboratories,
68                                                               AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


                computer rooms, etc., can be directly affected by them. It is only to such cases that this
                condition class applies, e.g., age of facilities, quality of facilities, controllable work
                center environment. Do things like heating, air conditioning, and lighting affect the
                work?
                3.24.3.2.2.2.4. Nonautomated tools and equipment. This condition covers specific
                tools and equipment, except for automated equipment or computers that are critical to
                doing the work.
                3.24.3.2.2.2.5. Automated Capabilities. This condition deals with automated equip-
                ment that has replaced or enhanced manual ways of doing work.
                3.24.3.2.2.2.6. Directed Performance Standards. This condition covers situations
                where how often work is done or how long it takes to do the work is directed by MAJ-
                COM or HQ USAF regulation or policy. It includes where a given level of manpower
                is set up independent of work volume.
                3.24.3.2.2.2.7. Wartime Conditions. This condition covers wartime conditions that
                affect work. For example, a need to wear special protective gear during nuclear, bio-
                logical, or chemical attack might increase the amount of time needed to do work or
                affect how, or how often, some tasks are done.
            3.24.3.2.2.3. Determining Applicability. Once you have identified the kinds of conditions
            that affect the work in each condition class, you will decide whether each of these condi-
            tions applies to every location or only to some of the locations.
            3.24.3.2.2.4. Work Measurement Instructions. Describe specific work measurement
            instructions peculiar to each work center in these sections. Do not repeat the general mea-
            surement instructions in Section A.
     3.24.3.3. Part Three - Measurement Report Format and Instructions:
        3.24.3.3.1. Tailor the content of the measurement report to the needs of the study. Limit the
        measurement report to minimum essential data. Furnish a table of contents listing the data col-
        lection forms, work measurement forms, skill and grade data, etc.
        3.24.3.3.2. Specify data submission by the most expedient means. Maximize the use of
        e-mail. Include email addresses for the study team. Set suspense dates as the latest day infor-
        mation must be sent.
     3.24.3.4. Part Four - Bibliography and Glossary.
        3.24.3.4.1. List functional publications that form the basis for functional mission require-
        ments.
        3.24.3.4.2. The input technician is not expected to be intimately familiar with unique func-
        tional terms and acronyms. Therefore, check the POD and identify terms and acronyms that
        must be defined in the glossary. List terms in alphabetical order.

             3.24.3.5.1.1. Title. Identify briefly what to count. Use singular form, i.e., "A Vehicle
             Repaired", not "Vehicles Repaired."
             3.24.3.5.1.2. Definition. Define the count in precise terms and tell what to include or
             exclude from the count. Vague definitions are not acceptable. For example, if "Population
             Served" is a potential workload factor, it must be clear whether the count includes tenants,
             on-base population, off-base population, transients, etc.
             3.24.3.5.1.3. Source and Method of Count. Identify the source from which the count is to
             be obtained. Be sure to include all information which could be used in identifying where,
             when, and what data is to be collected. Make sure the instructions will achieve the desired
             results by testing them. Tell how to record data when the count is zero or nonavailable.
             3.24.3.5.1.4. Rationale. Include the reasons for selecting work units or workload factors.
             Tell how and why the selected work units or workload factors are expected to relate to the
             measured man-hours.
             3.24.3.5.1.5. Method of Verification. Identify the source used to verify the data included
             in the primary source of count. This includes multiple sources used to derive the cumula-
             tive count documented in the primary source.

3.25. Work Measurement.
   3.25.1. Major Activities. Following are some potential major measurement activities. Depending on
   your approach, some or all may be required.
      3.25.1.1. Briefing the work center personnel about the measurement and the need for their partic-
      ipation.
      3.25.1.2. Measuring work and collecting workload data according to measurement instructions
      for the basic standard. Also, measuring and collecting data for any variances.
      3.25.1.3. Examining measurement results to make sure measured and collected data are accurate
      and show work center requirements.
      3.25.1.4. Briefing measurement report findings to base functional OPR.
      3.25.1.5. Coordinating the measurement report findings with the MAJCOM OPR.
   3.25.2. Measurement Approach.
      3.25.2.1. The study team needs to select the most suitable approach for obtaining the minimum
      essential data to be used to compute manpower requirements. The goal should be to use the least
      expensive approach that will produce acceptably valid and representative data within the shortest
      time. This will pave the way to cooperatively produce quality manpower standard tools in a more
      responsive time, at a significantly lower cost.
      3.25.2.2. The study team must first decide if it is necessary, or even possible to use work measure-
      ment techniques to get all or part of the needed data. Work measurement costs time, money, and
      keeps everyone involved from doing alternative work. Carefully consider the decision to use work
      measurement. Development of a functional model (AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2) may be an
      acceptable and economical approach when work measurement is not deemed necessary or possi-
      ble.
70                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


         3.25.2.3. Work measurement techniques may be used through field measurement, workshops or
         both. Both approaches have pros and cons. Generally, workshop measurement has been accept-
         able to both functional and manpower communities because it has been shown to produce quality
         products with less cost and time. Many work measurement methods work very effectively and
         efficiently when done in a properly constituted and well-run workshop. A combination of core
         modeling, flow and process charting and operational audit can be successfully done by workshop
         to develop a MEO, the associated manpower standards and level of service options. Some limited
         field measurement can be used to validate workshop products. The key to developing quality
         products at minimal cost is to have the full participation of the pertinent functional and manpower
         representatives at every stage, including the workshop. Staffing, as well, should be expedited to a
         successful and more timely conclusion. Field measurement very often incurs the greatest overall
         costs, takes the longest time and frequently encounters prolonged staffing. Consequently, care
         must be taken to select the correct approach, use the right tools and show their benefits and rele-
         vance to the functional representatives. Again, it must be a mutual decision to balance the cost and
         value added by the different measurement options.
     3.25.3. Work Measurement Locations. Use the following if on-site measurement is necessary:
         3.25.3.1. Select representative locations for work measurement and data collection. If test mea-
         surement will be used, select the test measurement site. If the workshop OA measurement
         approach is used, be sure the workshop participants are "representative" of the locations or units to
         which the subsequent standard will apply.
         3.25.3.2. Select a sample of these locations to make sure data will incorporate high, medium, and
         low workload volumes and represent work center conditions. The number of locations included in
         the measurement depends on the size of the population. Table 3.4. gives suggested sample sizes
         for the population to be covered by the standard. Avoid additional locations since the extra time
         and cost usually only delay the study effort.

Table 3.4. Minimum Number of Locations.

     3                    7-9                                       5
     4                   10 - 14                                    6
     5                   15 - 21                                    7
     6                   22 - 33                                    8

         3.25.3.3. Omit locations scheduled for a cost comparison study during the same period. Also omit
         locations where the function remained in-house as a result of a cost comparison study.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              71


     3.25.3.4. Get OPR concurrence on the type of locations needed (mission, geographic area, size,
     etc.) rather than limiting the need to specific bases.
     3.25.3.5. Coordinate with the respective MAJCOM headquarters to find the earliest date input
     teams would be available to participate. See AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, for definition of input
     team. Based on this date, set the measurement start date for the study. Other factors affecting this
     date are:
         3.25.3.5.1. The time needed by the study team to complete measurement design.
         3.25.3.5.2. Changes planned for the work center. Make sure the functional OPR understands
         the impact any changes in work center tasks or workload factors have on study findings. If
         changes are major and unavoidable, delay the start date for the study.
  3.25.4. Staffing Needs. Consider coordination, staffing, and approval needs as defined in the study
  contract. In functions with decentralized management and control, increased involvement at lower
  echelons is necessary. The project team must know the coordination role of each level in the func-
  tional community in order to plan the associated milestones.
  3.25.5. Standard Development Workshop. If used, the project team leader should be the facilitator or
  arrange to have a qualified facilitator for the workshop and the functional point of contact (POC) as
  chairperson. The chairperson makes sure the workshop is conducted in a professional manner and
  objectives are met.
  3.25.6. Workload Collection.
     3.25.6.1. The project team identifies workload collection needs. They include data collection
     instructions in the familiarization package when requesting functional representatives bring data
     to the workshop. For field measurements, the project team collects historical workload volume for
     the period specified. They also start a collection system to accurately capture the historical and
     current workload when such a system does not exist. Report workload data on a general-purpose
     form or comparable computerized format.
     3.25.6.2. Data collection starts at the direction of the project team and continues until told to stop.
     Collection continues until enough data is available for standard application.
     3.25.6.3. The project team decides whether to revise an existing reporting system or institute a
     new report. After data analysis and computations, a functional report control symbol (RCS) is
     assigned for workload data reporting. If the OPR must set up a new RCS report, the project team
     will furnish help to ensure the new report gives adequate information for workload data reporting.
  3.25.7. Field Measurement. Field measurement sites conduct measurement according to the method
  and instructions specified by the study team. Notify the project team immediately if difficulties are
  encountered or work requirements are identified which are not in the POD and have not been identi-
  fied for variance development. Inaccurate data results from failure to follow the instructions or from
  making assumptions when the instructions do not cover a given situation. Measure and document con-
  troversial steps separately until the issue is resolved. Special measurement considerations follow.
     3.25.7.1. Personal, Fatigue, and Delay Allowances. When using work sampling or good operator
     timing, the normal time to do an operation does not include allowances for the workers’ personal
     needs, rest, or work interruptions that are beyond the workers’ control. These measurement meth-
     ods and techniques are based on statistical accuracy and are designed to measure the amount of
72                                                              AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     time associated with the process or step. In these cases, apply allowances to find the allowed time.
     Allowances are classified as personal, fatigue, and unavoidable delay. Instructions for computing
     allowances are in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2. Generally, the project team identifies the relevant
     allowances and includes them in the measurement plan.
     3.25.7.2. Indirect Work. The primary means of crediting indirect work for operational audit stud-
     ies is by using SIAMs. AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, furnishes details on SIAMs.
     3.25.7.3. Pace Rating. When using work sampling, the consultant compares the observed pace of
     the worker to the normal pace at which the work would be done. This comparison and associated
     adjustment of step times is called pace rating and is designed to account for varying experience
     and skill levels within the work center. Instructions for pace rating are in AFMAN 38-208, Vol-
     ume 2.
     3.25.7.4. On-Call Time:
        3.25.7.4.1. On-call time is a period of time an off-duty worker is available at a prearranged
        off-duty location and can be reached by telephone or other means.
        3.25.7.4.2. When authorized work is required and cannot be held over to the next duty day,
        credit the work center with the productive time expended and the travel time needed to get to
        the job site and return to the off-duty location.
        3.25.7.4.3. Examples of on-call time are: a photographer who periodically is needed to take
        photos after duty hours; a maintenance journeyman needed infrequently to repair or replace a
        critical item of equipment; or an information officer who responds to local press inquiries
        when notified.
        3.25.7.4.4. Off-duty time spent waiting for a call is not measured or included in manpower
        standards.
     3.25.7.5. Borrowed Time and Loaned Time.
        3.25.7.5.1. Borrowed time is time provided by personnel authorized and assigned to another
        work center but used to do productive work within the work center being studied. Include bor-
        rowed man-hours under the pertinent process or step.
        3.25.7.5.2. Loaned time is time expended by work center personnel to do work which is the
        responsibility of another work center. Do not include loaned man-hours in the loaning work
        centers’ manpower standard.
     3.25.7.6. Overtime Credit. Uncompensated overtime credit is the productive time spent in excess
     of regularly scheduled duty hours. This time must be used to do productive work and cannot be
     caused by nonproductive activities or offset by compensatory time. For civilians, include only that
     overtime which is documented according to the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) supplement
     990-2 and AFI 36-802. For military personnel, document and thoroughly analyze the need for
     overtime. Ask the supervisor to validate overtime. If overtime is a normal occurrence, visit the
     work center during overtime periods and observe the work in progress. Identify the backlog driv-
     ing the overtime work. Include validated overtime as part of the relevant process or step time.
     3.25.7.7. Idle Time. This includes time spent by a worker in an avoidable delay status, doing
     unnecessary work, or doing work not job related. Measure idle time only during work sampling
     and never include it in the manpower standard.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                           73


     3.25.7.8. Standby Time. This is time spent in a ready status awaiting work when work is unavail-
     able (for example, the time a taxi driver waits to be dispatched). Include standby time only when
     it is essential to do the mission and when no other work (direct or indirect) can be done.
     3.25.7.9. Nonavailable Time. This is time work center personnel spend participating in activities
     directed, recognized, or approved by the Air Force which render them unavailable for assigned
     primary duties. The major groupings of nonavailable activities are leave, PCS-related, medical,
     organizational duties, education and training, military equal opportunity, and miscellaneous (see
     paragraph 3.22.6.).
        3.25.7.9.1. Measure nonavailable activities only with work sampling. Work sampling must
        account for all man-hours. Do not include nonavailable time in the allowed man-hours used to
        construct the manpower standard.
        3.25.7.9.2. Nonavailable activities measured Air Force wide are shown in the MAF published
        in AFI 38-201. Do not include these in the POD.
  3.25.8. Workshop Measurement.
     3.25.8.1. General Concepts. Use of a workshop setting provides a valuable tool regardless of the
     study product. A workshop provides a non-threatening environment in which both the M&O team
     and the customer can exchange ideas or information.
     3.25.8.2. Workshop Definition. A workshop is defined as a scheduled meeting with a predefined
     agenda, with a minimum of one representative from the M&O study team, and one functional rep-
     resentative.
     3.25.8.3. Workshop Purpose. Use the workshop to define a process or conduct measurement. In
     most cases the workshop attendees are familiar with the processes and can be brought to a consen-
     sus on the information of interest. If the workshop OA measurement approach is used, be sure the
     workshop participants are representative of the locations or units to which the information will
     apply. The functional OPR makes the final determination on workshop composition but must
     assure the project team that proper representation is provided.
        3.25.8.3.1. When the To-Be design for the organization is developed, present it to a group of
        functional representatives. This will allow ideas to be discussed by the experts in a non-threat-
        ening atmosphere.
        3.25.8.3.2. Also use the workshop to present the overall plan of attack to a group of functional
        representatives. If there are any potential problems in data collection methods or sources, they
        can be identified during the workshop.
     3.25.8.4. Workshop Procedures.
        3.25.8.4.1. Define Purpose of the Workshop. Before you can conduct or even plan a work-
        shop, you must know the purpose or ultimate goal. Develop the workshop’s objectives; how
        many processes need to be measured, do frequencies and benchmark times need to be col-
        lected, how many work centers are there, and what is the scope of the study.
        3.25.8.4.2. Determine Location of the Workshop. When selecting the workshop location, con-
        sider cost, availability of facilities, and the project team location. Schedule the workshop at a
        centralized location to reduce the overall travel costs. Conducting the workshop at the study
        team’s base will also expedite the process.
74                                                           AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


     3.25.8.4.3. Determine Who Should Attend. Considering the purpose of the workshop, you
     need to determine who should attend. Considering study scope and contract objectives, decide
     who should attend the workshop to include the functional representatives. For example, an Air
     Force study would need a participant from each MAJCOM who has the authority to speak for
     the MAJCOM. Also needed is a base-level expert who has recent hands-on experience in the
     work center. The senior functional manager should hand-pick the study participants. It is
     imperative the right people are selected for the success of the workshop. Always ensure com-
     plete representation while trying to minimize the number of participants. If the purpose is to
     present ideas for a reengineering study, and/or to gain MAJCOM support, request a strong
     contingent of MAJCOM-level personnel.
        3.25.8.4.3.1. If the purpose is to conduct workshop measurement, request personnel with
        recent work center experience.
        3.25.8.4.3.2. If the purpose of the workshop includes developing a standard with wartime
        application, make sure personnel with a readiness background or personnel who have
        recently participated in contingency operations or exercises attend.
        3.25.8.4.3.3. A general rule of thumb is that a good mix of officer, enlisted, and civilian
        personnel is beneficial. Each brings a different set of values to the workshop. Presenting
        criteria for attendee selection (to the function, MAJCOM, etc.) may be helpful to reduce
        the risk of nonqualified participants attending just because they are available.
     3.25.8.4.4. Schedule Workshop. Estimate how much time it will take to meet the objectives.
     Prepare a plan or schedule of those processes to measure and their order of measurement. Con-
     sider both the study needs and the needs of the attendees when scheduling the workshop. If
     there are conflicts with other events (major exercises, inspections, etc.), the attendees may be
     forced to cancel or send a replacement that does not necessarily meet the needs of the work-
     shop.
     3.25.8.4.5. Prepare and Distribute Preworkshop Information Package. Send an information
     package to each attendee. Make the materials as personalized as possible (addressed by name
     and possibly with some specific information the attendee requested). Also include in the pack-
     age base and local area information, a workshop agenda, travel instructions (if appropriate),
     and any other information that will contribute to the success of the workshop. Identify infor-
     mation/data the participants will be expected to bring to the workshop, and provide informa-
     tion that can be read before the event, thus saving workshop time. If possible and appropriate,
     collect inputs from participants prior to the workshop on information the group will be respon-
     sible for responding to.
     3.25.8.4.6. Ensure Facilities Are Ready. As part of the workshop planning, make sure that all
     equipment is available at the workshop location. Give consideration to a room layout that
     gives the appearance that all attendees are equal.
     3.25.8.4.7. Conduct the Workshop. There are many different ways to conduct a measurement
     workshop, and here are just a few ideas or suggestions:
        3.25.8.4.7.1. Ensure all participants know the purpose of the workshop and what their spe-
        cific responsibilities entail. Prepare briefings or short lesson plans to teach participants the
        basic concepts of the tools and techniques you intend to employ.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              75


           3.25.8.4.7.2. If the workshop focus is manpower estimates (frequencies, per accomplish-
           ment times) consider the following issues:
               3.25.8.4.7.2.1. Ensure each participant knows exactly what’s included in each process
               step before determining a time for it. Clarify any outstanding issues. Reaffirm to them
               that you are soliciting unbiased, data-oriented estimates.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.2. Give each participant a vote or opportunity to give their per accom-
               plishment times and activity frequencies for a process. To the maximum extent possi-
               ble, use time estimates and frequencies from validated man-hour and workload
               collection systems. If you’re doing an Air Force-wide study, you might want to have
               only one vote per MAJCOM (with the base representatives within a MAJCOM decid-
               ing on an average time for the MAJCOM) or each location can give individual times
               and frequencies. Decide how to record the data before the workshop. Regardless of the
               manner selected, you must make sure the times provided are kept confidential until all
               representatives have given their estimates. This prevents attendees from influencing
               each other. This is important because it’s the primary means for you to determine vari-
               ation from representative to representative. This variation is an indicator of areas for
               efficiencies, or perhaps, unique needs for variance development. Individual times are
               the preferred method if you are going to regress the data and build a statistical man-
               power standard. MAJCOM average times are preferred if you’re going to build a man-
               power standard with work unit ratio equations.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.3. Ensure that the workshop participants are giving you average times per
               process step, not the worst case scenario or ideal scenario. Be prepared to calculate
               weighted step averages and show the workshop participants how to do this.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.4. Ensure the workshop participants prove or validate their step times and
               frequencies, if necessary, during the workshop.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.5. Tell the workshop participants how their step times and frequencies
               will be used to prepare a manpower standard, and give them an example of what the
               standard will look like.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.6. Reconcile the measurement data, if possible during the workshop, with
               the senior functional manager.
               3.25.8.4.7.2.7. Attempt to gain consensus and agreement on inputs before the end of
               the workshop. This will increase the chance of buy-in and coordination during later
               parts of the project.
       3.25.8.4.8. Follow up on Workshop Results. The personnel who attend a workshop have a
       vested interest in the results. This will be especially true if base-level representatives attend the
       workshop. Send each participant a summary of the workshop results. Ask the participants to
       critique the workshop.
       3.25.8.4.9. Benefits of Workshop Measurement. The major benefit of using workshop mea-
       surement is that it reduces the study measurement time. It also eliminates the need for an
       extensive measurement plan, data adjustments, and data errors since they can be handled dur-
       ing the workshop.
76                                                                AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


               3.25.8.4.9.1. Workshop attendees can identify and quantify (if wanted) MAJCOM vari-
               ances. This action delivers a more complete manpower picture.
               3.25.8.4.9.2. Having the functional representatives involved from the start drastically
               reduces the staffing of the study final report.
               3.25.8.4.9.3. By utilizing a workshop environment for measurement with our functional
               customers, we are attempting to build a team with an improved teamwork attitude and
               approach. This should create a synergistic, cooperative environment for the rest of the
               study.
           3.25.8.4.10. Drawbacks of Workshop Measurement. The major drawback is the TDY costs
           and scheduling difficulties associated with a workshop. This will impact the number of people
           attending a workshop.
     3.25.9. Field Measurement.
        3.25.9.1. General Concepts. While workshop measurement involves bringing together experts
        from several different sites to do a "centralized" measurement, field measurement is just the oppo-
        site. The project team writes a measurement plan. This plan incorporates the manpower and per-
        formance improvement initiatives for measurement. The plan is then sent out to a representative
        sample of locations to conduct measurements using the prescribed measurement technique(s).
        Like the workshop measurement, the objective of field measurement is to gather information
        about the work center or function. This information or data is then transferred back to the project
        team for consolidation with the other inputs. The field measurement approach may use a number
        of measurement techniques.
        3.25.9.2. Field-Level Input Team Activities.
           3.25.9.2.1. Each input team and the local functional representative should consider the follow-
           ing before beginning measurement:
           3.25.9.2.2. The input team must become familiar with the work center mission, the POD, the
           measurement technique, and any local peculiarities so that they can accurately convey findings
           to the study team.
           3.25.9.2.3. The functional representative must ensure the M&O consultant (team) is provided
           access to necessary information and that all pertinent information is included in the measure-
           ment findings. Also, the local functional representatives are an ideal source for identifying
           additional efficiencies that may impact the existing organization and its processes.
        3.25.9.3. Benefits of Field Measurement.
           3.25.9.3.1. The field teams are able to do follow-on data review once analysis begins. With
           the workshop method, once the participants leave, it may be difficult to get the consensus of all
           attendees on issues raised during limited test measurement.
           3.25.9.3.2. Scheduling becomes less of an issue, as there is little or no TDY travel involved.
           This means the functional representatives are still in their work centers and are able to control
           its activities while helping provide measurement data.
           3.25.9.3.3. The field-level M&O project team would have access to all levels of the work
           force to get a very detailed assessment of the work center’s activities. This is an advantage
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                             77


          over the workshop method that limits the number of functional personnel attending due to
          space and monetary considerations.
      3.25.9.4. Drawbacks of Field Measurement. The major drawback to using field measurement is
      the increased study measurement time. Due to the number of personnel involved, the probability
      for data errors (corrections and adjustments) increases, further slowing the process, and introduces
      more variation into the data. When using “same eyes” measurement approach, the cost of perform-
      ing measurement due to TDY is significantly increased.
   3.25.10. Data Examination. The examination and analysis of input data is an integral part of data col-
   lection and is done by the input team when they are used. Improper examination results in incorrect
   data being used for standards development. AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, shows some procedures for
   effective data analysis. Basically, the analyst should:
      3.25.10.1. Compare data with known or expected values.
          3.25.10.1.1. Compare measured and collected data with performance standards, directed
          requirements, and benchmark values included in the measurement plan.
          3.25.10.1.2. Compare historical workload volume with workload observed during data collec-
          tion.
          3.25.10.1.3. Compare historical workload volume with the workload (frequencies) obtained
          during measurement.
          3.25.10.1.4. Compare measured man-hours (on a daily basis) with assigned man-hours.
          3.25.10.1.5. Compare workload factor volumes. Compare workload factors either directly or
          by a ratio relationship. For example, the ratio of aircrew members to aircraft should be predict-
          able and relatively stable.
      3.25.10.2. Investigate when comparisons yield unreasonable or illogical results. This investiga-
      tion may lead to a need for re-measurement. Identify situations which logically support apparent
      data inconsistencies. Submit rationale for inconsistencies to the study team.
   3.25.11. Data Transmission. The project team should identify the most cost effective data transmis-
   sion and require its use.
   3.25.12. Review and Coordination. The M&O function coordinates measurement report findings with
   the functional community as specified in the MOA.

3.26. Data Analysis and Computation.
   3.26.1. General Concepts. This section introduces data analysis and computation into the normal flow
   of standards development activities. It covers general steps on how to conduct data analysis. AFMAN
   38-208, Volume 2, covers specific procedures.
   3.26.2. Data Analysis and Computation Instructions. Variations in measurement data from the input
   locations or from a workshop measurement are expected. Conduct a systematic data analysis to sepa-
   rate valid variations from incorrect measurements and make sure inaccurate man-hours are not
   included in computing the manpower model.
      3.26.2.1. Every analysis technique will not apply in all situations. Evaluate measurement data
      using comparative arrays, scattergrams, etc.
78                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.26.2.2. Do not include or exclude measurement data based on arbitrary statistical limits (e.g.,
        outside two standard deviations of the mean). Evaluate each suspect data point further before mak-
        ing a final decision on disposition. There is no valid statistical substitute for logical analysis and
        examination of the reasons for data variation. If a data point is excluded or adjusted for model
        computations, document the reason for the exclusion or adjustment. Furnish specific rationale for
        why the standard should apply to a location excluded from computations.
        3.26.2.3. When SIAMs are used for a function, analyze only direct man-hour data.
        3.26.2.4. Do not make arbitrary adjustments to measured data. The project team must coordinate
        any adjustment with the input team who, in turn, must coordinate the adjustment with the base
        OPR. Coordinate adjustments based on functional policy with the functional OPR. Document all
        adjustments in the data analysis and computations summary and audit trail (backup file) of the
        study report. Audit trails of all corrections, including computational errors and rounding differ-
        ences, are kept in the study teams’ backup file but are not documented in the study report.

3.27. Manpower Standard Variances.
     3.27.1. Manpower standard variances are adjuncts to Air Force or command manpower standards and
     are identified as either positive or negative; variances adjust requirements by either adding or subtract-
     ing from core manpower as determined by reason of mission, technical, or environmentally unique
     reasons. Variances address work that is not accomplished at all locations where the standard applies
     and allow for manpower adjustments. They also address location conditions that are significantly dif-
     ferent from the conditions that the standard covers. Variances increase or decrease requirements IAW
     validated unique needs of a command or location. Variances should be identified during POD devel-
     opment, measurement plan development/review, and As-Is workshop validation. Any variance identi-
     fied after this point runs the risk of not receiving man-hour credit during standards implementation.
     3.27.2. The following are examples of possible location-specific differences from documented stan-
     dardization:
        3.27.2.1. Mission differences. This variance type adds or subtracts man-hours to a location for
        required work not addressed in the core POD (positive) or required work identified in the core
        POD but not performed (negative).
        3.27.2.2. Environmental differences. This variance has a similar effect on work center require-
        ments as a mission variance. However, it accounts for differences in operating conditions other
        than those used to develop the core standard (e.g., snow removal/deicing of aircraft, effects of salt
        (near ocean) on corrosion control, effects of geographical separation on travel, etc.).
        3.27.2.3. Technological differences. This variance also affects work center requirements; how-
        ever, it accounts for differences in operating technology (e.g., automated versus nonautomated,
        special equipment, etc.). An example of a negative technological variance is documenting the
        man-hour impact (new equipment saved enough man-hours to subtract one authorization at appli-
        cable location) resulting from implementation of a Fast Payback Capital Investment Program
        (FASCAP) project.
     3.27.3. When a variance exists at more than four locations, the manpower standard development
     project team may use a modular equation to adjust the core standard.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                                                     79


   3.27.4. When a variance is applicable to more than one MAJCOM, it is considered an inherent part of
   the Air Force standard development process. When a variance is only applicable to one MAJCOM,
   the MAJCOM has the responsibility to develop it.
   3.27.5. In an Air Force standard development effort, MAJCOMs are first given the opportunity to
   identify variances during coordination of the process oriented description, measurement plan review
   or in As-Is validation workshop. When a M&O office identifies a potential variance it completes an
   AF Form 1068, Work Center Analysis Record and sends it to its MAJCOM for review. If the MAJ-
   COM supports the variance, it sends the AF Form 1068 to the Air Force functional OPR, who con-
   firms whether the variance is covered in an Air Force core standard and applicability to another
   MAJCOM. If the variance is only applicable to the requesting MAJCOM, the M&O office comments
   on its merit and tells the MAJCOM whether or not to proceed with variance development. If applica-
   ble to more than one MAJCOM, AFMIA develops the variance and sends the results to the Air Staff
   OPR for approval. Instructions for completing an AF Form 1068 are in Table 3.5. If additional help is
   required, contact your parent MAJCOM.

   6B     Appropriate cross-reference to the process, step, or paragraph in the POD for each variance.

          type (i.e., mission, environmental, or technological).

          generating the variance.
   6E     The estimated monthly man-hour impact associated with each positive variance. This column is left blank
          when identifying possible negative variances.
   6F     Specific comments on the disposition of each entry as determined by the MAJCOM, AFMIA, or Study Team.
          AFMIA or Project team confirms if entry is in the AFMS or has merit.

        3.27.5.1. Variances currently valid with the old standard must also be documented and forwarded
        with the Reengineering Final Report for review. Failure to do this could inadvertently result in the
        rescinding of old variances.
        3.27.5.2. Variances are forwarded to MAJCOM for staffing, coordination, and concurrence. If the
        MAJCOM concurs, development of a variance will coincide with the measurement phase of the
        core standard. Some variances may require rework as a result of decisions made by the reengineer-
        ing team during measurement and computation.
80                                                                 AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


        3.27.5.3. During normal reviews of published standards, it is possible things may have changed
        resulting in a need for an update to the standard. New variances identified during a standards
        review will be documented and forwarded to the applicable OPR, Air Staff, or MAJCOM for dis-
        position. Each installation MO with their functional OPR will be responsible for coordinating the
        potential variance at their base.
     3.27.6. Positive Variance Development.
        3.27.6.1. By definition, processes outlined for positive variances must not be in the core POD.
        MAJCOM or higher headquarters policy or publication must direct these added activities.

        3.27.6.3. Man-hour credit can be given for these activities in support of mobility, deployment, or
        war plan exercises.
            3.27.6.3.1. Developing mobility and work center tasking plans.
            3.27.6.3.2. Maintaining a day-to-day mobility capability according to the mobility and work
            center tasking plans. Some of these activities include:
               3.27.6.3.2.1. Periodically taking inventory of mobility containers.
               3.27.6.3.2.2. Removing and replacing materials in mobility containers.
               3.27.6.3.2.3. Inspecting mobility equipment containers and equipment for proper identifi-
               cation and serviceability.
               3.27.6.3.2.4. Maintaining the mobility status of personnel and equipment.
            3.27.6.3.3. Work accomplished during exercises by assigned work center personnel is the
            responsibility of the work center but only occurs because an exercise took place. An example
            is the reporting to, and signing in at, the mobility processing line by work center personnel.
            This may also be work that occurs on a day-to-day basis in the normal work center area, but
            has significant frequency increases caused by exercise workload. In this case, define work
            activity in sufficient detail to discriminate between normal work center requirements and exer-
            cise work center requirements. This ensures activity frequencies for the variance are not dupli-
            cated in the categories of the basic standard.
            3.27.6.3.4. Work done in an exercise by assigned work center personnel that is a responsibil-
            ity of the function (two-digit functional account code) but not a peacetime responsibility of
            any specific work center within the function. An example of this is when a vehicle mainte-
            nance craftsman within AETC performs aerial port duties in support of a deployment exercise.
            Make sure this work is not a responsibility of another work center.

     3.27.6.7. Use any of the measurement or nonmeasurement methods such as work sampling, oper-
     ational audit, time study, minimum manning, and staffing pattern to get the data needed for the
     variance.
     3.27.6.8. Use SIAMs to credit a work center for indirect man-hours associated with a positive
     variance. The following instructions allow credit for indirect personnel-generated man-hours for a
     positive variance:
        3.27.6.8.1. Step 1. Measure the direct man-hours associated with the variance. For example,
        let's assume the added direct man-hours are 206.47.
        3.27.6.8.2. Step 2. Convert the direct man-hours to manpower. In our example:
        206.47/ (151.5 x 1.077) = 1.265
        3.27.6.8.3. Step 3. Decide whether the fractional manpower derived in the previous step is to
        be a civilian, officer, or enlisted requirement.
        3.27.6.8.4. Step 4. Use an activity frequency of 1.265 (step 2) to find the number of personnel
        generated (PG) man-hours. Add to the measured direct variance man-hours.
        3.27.6.8.5. Indirect fixed tasks. These will not be credited to variances since, by definition, the
        fixed man-hours will not change.

     3.27.7. Negative Variance Development. The form a negative variance man-hour equation takes
     depends on the nature of the work not being done.
        3.27.7.1. Often, the excluded work is best represented as a percentage of the total man-hours for
        the work center. In this case, calculate the percentage of excluded man-hours to total work center
        measured man-hours for each measurement location excluding the work. Then analyze these per-
        centages using the data examination techniques in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2. Compute the mean
        percentage value and use it to build a negative variance man-hour equation in the form of Y = bX,
        where b equals the percentage value and where X equals the total work center man-hours from
        applying the work center determinant at a base covered by the variance.
        3.27.7.2. Other times, when excluded work does not change as other variables or factors change,
        display the variance equation as a constant (in terms of man-hours or whole manpower).
     3.27.8. Format Guidance. Format the variance using the AFMIA home page, Air Force Manpower
     Standards, Tech Guidance and Forms, Air Force Manpower Standards Publishing Guide.

3.28. Future Manpower Requirements Determination.
     3.28.1. The manpower standard development process identifies a work center’s man-hour to work-
     load relationship and quantifies manpower requirements for Air Force functional activities. Use the
     resulting standard as a tool for the accurate distribution and use of Air Force manpower resources. The
     functional area manager at either Air Force or MAJCOM level can initiate a manpower standard
     development study. Some reasons for a study include:
        3.28.1.1. Major changes in policy, mission, equipment, technology, organization, or work envi-
        ronment invalidates the existing standard.
        3.28.1.2. Performance measures system feedback data shows the standard is no longer valid.
        3.28.1.3. Changes in workload volume may show the standard no longer accurately predicts man-
        power requirements.
     3.28.2. Manpower Standard.
        3.28.2.1. Manpower standards may be applicable to peacetime, contingency operations, or both.
        Standards development varies from study to study. All functions or work centers do not lend
        themselves to the same method of determining requirements, meaning all standards are not devel-
        oped using the same tool(s) and technique(s).
        3.28.2.2. Manpower standard variances address work that is not included in the core manpower
        standard. These differences may result in increases or decreases to core manpower requirements
        (see paragraph 3.27.)
     3.28.3. Manpower Standard Development Concepts.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                            83


     3.28.3.1. Manpower standards are based on the concept that like work center operations are effi-
     cient and standardized throughout the Air Force or MAJCOM.
     3.28.3.2. A single location measurement can be considered for application or adoption at all like
     locations, however it is not the preferred method.
     3.28.3.3. Base measurement and computation procedures on average monthly man-hour and
     workload requirements.
     3.28.3.4. The Air Force develops manpower standards that apply primarily to peacetime environ-
     ments. However, because of the uncertainty involved with addressing a war time scenario, refer to
     the applicable functional manager for guidance.
     3.28.3.5. Commercial activities present special opportunities to develop and maintain manpower
     standards. Changes to manpower occur when an activity remains in-house after a cost study.
     These activities do not remain static simply because a cost study has been conducted. Develop
     manpower and workload relationships to allow for and to document these changes as follows:
        3.28.3.5.1. Use direct labor projected in the in-house cost estimate and the workload specified
        in the performance work statement (PWS) to develop these relationships in the form of a man-
        power equation. The equation may be applicable to multiple locations having the same perfor-
        mance requirements or may be developed for a single location.
        3.28.3.5.2. Use the PWS as the basis for a POD to reflect the process steps involved and the
        level of performance expected.
        3.28.3.5.3. Once an equation is developed, changes in manpower requirements should result
        only from changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, quality required, etc., that
        directly affect the PWS. For example, the manpower community uses the same test to review
        increases as the contracting officer uses if the activity goes contract and the contractor
        attempts to increase prices.
     3.28.3.6. Simulation Data Requirements.
        3.28.3.6.1. Types Of Studies. Using simulation is a viable option when determining require-
        ments. There are three distinct methods currently verifiable that can be used.
        3.28.3.6.2. Single Point Application. The simulation is built and run for a single location.
        3.28.3.6.3. Input Points To An Equation. The sample location’s inputs are used to drive indi-
        vidual simulation runs and the output is plotted for total man-hours.
        3.28.3.6.4. Programmable Model. The equation is developed using traditional techniques. A
        ratio equation or correlation and regression is used to determine an appropriate arrival stream.
        The output of the simulation run is used to determine the direct man-hours applicable to the
        function. Appropriate SIAM and other man-hours are then accumulated to determine the
        requirement.
        3.28.3.6.5. Data Reporting Requirements.

     imum essential formatting requirements. Any other information deemed "value added" may be
     included.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                               87


     3.29.4.1. Heading. The FAC is preceded by "AFMS" for Air Force manpower standards.
        3.29.4.1.1. When two manpower standards exist for the same work center under two different
        organizational structures, add an alphabetical prefix to the number.
        3.29.4.1.2. To identify a standard that applies to wartime only, add the prefix "W" to the num-
        ber.
     3.29.4.2. Title. For the title use the appropriate designation (flight, section, or element) to identify
     the standard MAJCOM or base unique manpower standards, add the appropriate MAJCOM desig-
     nation or base name after the title. For example, "Security Operations Flight, Ramstein."
     3.29.4.3. Mission Statement, Responsibility Statement, Authority, and Applicability. Combine
     these elements to form the purpose paragraph, which is the first paragraph of the manuscript:
        3.29.4.3.1. Mission Statement. Prepare a brief, concise statement of the mission objectives for
        the function under study. Try to limit this statement to five typed lines.
        3.29.4.3.2. Responsibility Statement. This is a series of broad statements that define the mis-
        sion support capabilities of each subordinate element. These statements should encompass the
        major processes or work activities performed in support of the flight. If a flight has no subor-
        dinate elements, the responsibility statement is not required.
        3.29.4.3.3. Authority. Cite appropriate functional and management engineering sources that
        support the manpower standard and its development.
        3.29.4.3.4. Applicability. Include a statement that identifies the environment in which the
        function operates (peacetime/wartime). Additionally, specifically address the following:
            3.29.4.3.4.1. Furnish an applicability statement by MAJCOM, organizational elements,
            weapon system, etc., as pertinent. Specify the locations where the standard applies or does
            not apply, whichever is less. Also identify any limitations that restrict when and how the
            manpower standard can be used.
            3.29.4.3.4.2. Identify specific applicability to the Air National Guard and Air Force
            Reserve units programmed to be gained by active force MAJCOMs and FOAs.
            3.29.4.3.4.3. State that bases undergoing AFI 38-203 cost comparison studies will be
            exempt from standard application. Also state that standards do not apply to locations that
            have completed cost comparisons. For objective flight standards, the above statements are
            only applicable if the entire flight is undergoing or has undergone an AFI 38-203 cost com-
            parison study. If an element within a flight is undergoing or has undergone an AFI 38-203
            cost comparison study, a mission variance must be developed to account for these
            man-hours. See Figure 3.17. for an example of application instructions for a cost compar-
            ison mission variance.

Figure 3.17. Example Application Instructions for a Cost Comparison Mission Variance.


APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR A-76 COST COMPARISON POSITIONS
1. NEGATIVE MISSION VARIANCE. Develop a negative mission variance to reduce the
core process man-hours for those processes that have undergone an A-76 Cost Comparison
and have been contracted-out or remained in-house.
1.1. STEP 1. Determine the core process man-hours that were cost compared by identifying the
cost compared processes listed in the Process Analysis Summary. For example, assume that
BITC was cost compared in the IM Flight. The process "Manage Official Mail" is the only
process performed by BITC. This process equates to 386.00 core man-hours (2.40 fractional
manpower).
1.2. STEP 2. Determine total flight core process man-hours. In the IM Flight, the total flight
core man-hours equate to 2978.50.
1.3. STEP 3. Determine the percentage of the cost compared process to the total flight core
process man-hours. In this example, it equates to 12.95% (386.00/2978.50). This step is
necessary because the cost compared process man-hours are imbedded in the core +/-
manpower equation (Y = 18.54 + (population supported - 3,000) * 0.003056).
1.4. STEP 4. Apply the core +/- manpower equation (Y = 18.54 + (population supported -
3,000) * 0.003056). For example, assume that the population at your location is 5,000. This
equates to 24.65 fractional manpower requirements.
1.5. STEP 5. Determine the negative variance manpower (man-hours) by multiplying the
fractional manpower result in Step 4, by the cost compared process percentage in step 3. For
example, 24.65 * 12.95% = 3.19.
2. POSITIVE MISSION VARIANCE. Develop a positive mission variance to account for the
inclusion of the in-house or contracted-out manpower required to perform the processes IAW
the A-76 Cost Comparison Performance Work Statement (PWS) and the Most Efficient
Organization (MEO).
2.1. REMAINED IN-HOUSE. If the processes underwent competitive sourcing (an A-76 cost
comparison or a direct conversion), and remained in-house, update the UMD to reflect the
manpower earned in the MEO and code these civilian authorizations with an MES code of “S”
and the appropriate reason code (RSC). Develop a positive variance, which contains an
equation that is responsive to future PWS changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities,
and quality required, etc. Note: With a direct conversion, the MEO is the “as is operation”
which may also change based on future PWS changes in workload, procedures,
responsibilities, and quality required, etc.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                            89


2.2. CONTRACTED-OUT. If the processes underwent competitive sourcing (an A-76 cost
comparison or a direct conversion) and is contracted-out, update the UMD manpower
requirement to reflect the contract manpower equivalents (CMEs) earned in the MEO. Enter a
manpower type attribute of “CME” category attribute of “CIV” and civilian employment
category of “CEC 80” on UMD. Develop a positive variance, which contains an equation that
is responsive to future PWS changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, and quality
required, etc. Note: With a direct conversion, the MEO is the “as is operation” which may
also change based on future PWS workload changes, procedures, responsibilities, and quality
required, etc.
NOTE: When applicable, the variance should also address the number of civilian Quality
Assurance Evaluators (QAEs) that were earned as result of contracting out the processes.
Although all QAEs shall be addressed in the variance, only whole manpower can be added to
the core standard. Partial QAEs (.5) or their associated man-hours cannot be added to the
application results.
      3.29.4.4. Standard Data.
          3.29.4.4.1. Approval Date. This will remain blank in the study report.
          3.29.4.4.2. Man-hour Data Source. Enter workshop measurement, work sampling, operational
          audit technique, or other development method. Identify relevant policy or publications for
          standards developed without work measurement. For a standard developed by the functional
          model method, include the statement "Historical Documents - Functional Model."
          3.29.4.4.3. Man-hour Equation. State the equation in terms of man-hours unless it represents
          constant manpower. If it represents constant manpower, state the equation in terms of whole
          manpower requirements and identify the requirements as a manpower value. For example, Y =
          1 (Constant Manpower). If there is more than one equation, include a subparagraph for each.
          If no equation exists, so state, and document the method for determining manpower require-
          ments (e.g., "See manpower matrix").
          3.29.4.4.4. Workload Factor (WLF).
              3.29.4.4.4.1. Title. Enter the complete WLF title. If there is more than one WLF, include
              a subparagraph for each title and state applicability (for example, peacetime, wartime, or
              specific applicability when modular equations are used). For overhead work centers using
              subordinate work center requirements as the WLF, use the title: Required Man-hours in
              Subordinate Work Centers after Application of the Basic Standard.
              3.29.4.4.4.2. Definition. Use enough detail to ensure complete understanding of the WLF.
              If there is more than one WLF, include a subparagraph for each definition. For overhead
              work centers that use "man-hours in subordinate work centers" as the WLF, use the WLF
              definition, "The total number of required man-hours in (identify the subordinate work cen-
              ters) as a result of standard application." When the data being collected is classified, add
              these statements after the WLF definition: "This data, when collected, is classified. Mark
              and safeguard according to AFI 31-401."
              3.29.4.4.4.3. Source. Identify the exact source including RCS number, section, line num-
              ber, or column for each workload factor. If there is more than one WLF, include a subpara-
              graph for each source. If needed, place instructions in this paragraph on how to count the
90                                                               AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


            WLF volume before using it in the standard man-hour equation. For overhead work cen-
            ters that use man-hours in subordinate work centers as the WLF, use this source: "Standard
            application results for the work centers listed in the definition." If any of these do not have
            a manpower standard, add the sentence: "For (list those work centers that do not have man-
            power standards), use the authorizations shown in the unit manpower document (UMD) as
            the required manpower." Convert these authorizations (do not use fractional manpower
            ranges) to man-hours by multiplying by the proper MAF.
        3.29.4.4.5. Points of Contact. Enter the office symbol of the manpower and functional repre-
        sentatives.
     3.29.4.5. Application Instructions.
        3.29.4.5.1. Give general and specific standard application instructions, computations, use of
        extrapolation limits, aggregation, and use of fractional manpower.
        3.29.4.5.2. Include any special instructions on how to use WLF data in the man-hour equation
        (if appropriate).
        3.29.4.5.3. Describe the steps to determine any core plus/minus, or variance man-hours (man-
        power) if appropriate.
        3.29.4.5.4. Include, if relevant, instructions for substituting grades, AFSCs, and civilian
        authorizations; the treatment of contractual workload; and any pertinent aircrew position iden-
        tifiers.
        3.29.4.5.5. For a manpower standard based on prior application of standards in subordinate
        work centers, give instructions including the specific standards and sequence of application.
        3.29.4.5.6. Develop a clear, concise statement in the application instructions specifying any
        other work centers whose fractional requirement can be aggregated with this work centers’
        fractional requirement before rounding to whole requirements. For example, the statement
        should read: "Fractional manpower requirements resulting from the application of this stan-
        dard will be aggregated with the fractional requirements for FACs XXXX, XXXX, etc. Aggre-
        gation will be done according to procedures in AFI 38-201."
     3.29.4.6. Statement of Conditions (SOC). The purpose of the SOC is to document general condi-
     tions in the work center which impact manpower requirements. It describes those significant initi-
     atives incorporated into the standard. Use the SOC in the measurement plan and comments from
     the measurement reports to build the SOC for the standard. Provide a general accounting of the
     baseline operating environment conditions under which the work centers’ manpower was com-
     puted.
     3.29.4.7. Functional Description or Process Oriented Description. Include as an attachment to the

     Make sure the POD complies with instructions in paragraph 3.22. of this volume. For standards
     developed by directed requirement, staffing pattern, position manning, or functional model, a
     detailed POD may be replaced by a functional description.
     3.29.4.8. Standard Manpower Table.
        3.29.4.8.1. Include as an attachment to the manuscript an AF Form 1113, Standard Man-

        whole manpower required (by AFSC and grade) for all possible combinations within the
        applicability range (e.g., core plus or minus and all variances not specifying a fixed require-
        ment). Develop skills and grades for each manpower increment between the extrapolation lim-
        its on the manpower table. Complete the manpower table according to instructions in Table
        3.9. Use as many pages as necessary to display the standard’s manpower extrapolation range.
        If a manpower matrix is used instead of the AF Form 1113, ensure that the same data is
        reported. Contact AFMIA for approval of all comparable forms and manpower matrices prior
        to finalizing the AFMS.
        3.29.4.8.2. When a colonel requirement or position is identified, the project team verifies
        OPR justification by complying with procedures outlined in AFI 38-201.
        3.29.4.8.3. Show rated specialty requirements only if the processes described in the POD are
        clearly associated with the skills described in AFI 36-2105 for the rated specialty.
        3.29.4.8.4. Use instructions in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, to identify AFSC, skill level, and
        grade requirements for standards.
        3.29.4.8.5. The manpower table or matrix always shows military specialties and skill levels.
        Military grades are shown when a military and civilian mix exists. An exception is allowed to
        this rule if the work center is an all-civilian work center with a military manager. Use the
        abbreviation CIV under the grade column only when the work center is all civilians. The civil-
        ian personnel classification office identifies the suitable civilian grades.
     3.29.4.9. Variances. Include as an attachment to the manuscript a copy of all approved variances.
     Complete the following for each variance:
        3.29.4.9.1. Variance Title. Provide a short title for each variance. Precede the title with the
        application (positive or negative) and the appropriate variance category (mission, environmen-
        tal, or technological). For example, "Positive Mission Variance for Contract Quality Assur-
        ance Evaluation."
        3.29.4.9.2. Applicability. Provide a detailed applicability statement (e.g., unique to a specific
        location, command, etc.).
        3.29.4.9.3. Impact. Provide the man-hour (followed by the fractional manpower in parenthe-
        ses) impact associated with the variance. Also include a breakout of the impact to the level
        provided in the definition (e.g., down to step level). If the variance is negative, make sure the
        impact is shown as a negative value. Include any workload data collection (title, definition,
        and source of count) and specific application instructions, when appropriate.

                              the standard, specify the upper limit for the workload. Do this by putting the message
                              "(Upper Workload Value = XXX)" under the man-hour range. When the standard contains
                              more than one equation enter See paragraph 5 "Application Instructions" in this block. Enter

     3   Air Force Specialty All Air Force Specialty (AFS) titles required in the work center at any requirement level
         Title               within the applicability range. Use the titles in AFMANs 36-2105 and 36-2108 to identify
                             both military and civilian requirements. Titles must also reflect any prefix or suffix shown in
                             the AFSC column. List officers first, then airmen. Group titles by career area/career
                             progression group, and within career specialty list in order of descending AFSC.
     4   AFSC                 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) that corresponds to the specialty title. List both title and
                              AFSC in descending order of AFSC within career area. When the primary function of the
                              work center is not administration, list administration specialties after all others.
     5   Grade                For a military requirement, the grade associated with the specified AFSC based on the policy
                              of two grades per skill level for enlisted requirements. For example: A 7-level will be either a
                              TSgt on MSgt. If any of the manpower requirements are military, treat all requirements as
                              military. When all requirements are civilian, enter "CIV" next to the corresponding AFSC.
                              MAJCOM can replace "CIV" with the appropriate civilian grades in the manpower title. Prior
                              to exercising this option, review AFI 38-201 for policy guidance. Within AFSC, list grades in
                              descending order. Show all grades below SRA as A1C, and show both 1st and 2d lieutenants
                              as LT. Use standard data codes, for example, CMS instead of CMSGT.

         Requirements         of requirements within the range bounded by the lower and upper extrapolation limits. To
                              insure that all levels of manpower are covered on the manpower table, consider all of the
                              MAFs that apply, then: (1) The smallest number of people shown on the table is the number
                              required for the largest applicable MAF at the lower extrapolation limit. (2) The largest
                              number of people shown on the table is the number required for the smallest applicable MAF
                              at the upper extrapolation limit.
     7   Total                The total requirement for AFSCs and grades in the column. The first and last total will reflect
                              the manpower associated with the extrapolation range.

         3.29.4.10. Process Analysis Summary. Include, as attachment 4 to the cover page, a process anal-
         ysis summary. List each process (using the POD process number) by priority, from highest to low-
         est (highest being listed first). Include the process time (in man-hours and minutes), the projected
         workload volume (for standards with fixed core manpower), and the resulting fractional man-
         power (for standards with fixed core manpower).

     3.29.5.1. General Concepts. The data analysis and computation summary is prepared by the
     project team and furnishes relevant information for any reviewer to assess the data and the process
     used to develop the standard. The summary is an audit trail from data collection through selection
     of the suitable manpower model. Include the summary in the final report. When SIAMs are used
     for all applicable indirect tasks, the data analysis and computation summary is limited to direct
     process analysis only. If measurement is used in lieu of a SIAM task time, data analysis and com-
     putation summary will be furnished for each measured indirect task. The amount of detail needed
     in Part Three varies with the type of analysis and computations conducted. As a minimum, items
     needed for each initiative and the final man-hour equation are:

          included for application, furnish specific rationale.
          3.29.5.3.4. Data Adjustments. Adjustments are defined as changes to reported frequencies,
          per accomplishment times, allowed man-hours, or workload values made by the project team
          so the data shown in the manpower equation differs from the data sent by an input team. Do
          not classify computational errors or rounding differences as adjustments. Changes to original

3.30. Trial Impact Application.
     3.30.1. General Concepts. Once a manpower standard or variance has been developed, the next step
     is to apply the standard. This accomplishes two objectives. It validates that the standard or variance
     captures all mission-essential workload and predicts what the manpower impact could be if the stan-
     dard is approved for implementation. Application results are used to brief senior staff and are filed for
     historical purposes. The process consists of three basic steps: workload factor collection and valida-
     tion; manpower standard trial application; and documenting what the predicted manpower impact
     would be if the standard is implemented.
     3.30.2. Workload Values for Peacetime Application of Standards. Collect the workload factors iden-
     tified in the manpower standard or variance. The baseline quarter for a trial impact application is the
     fourth quarter of the fiscal year in which implementation is scheduled. Since the trial impact applica-
     tion only addresses one fiscal quarter, make sure the workload levels represent the average monthly
     level of work present in the quarter. Look at historical monthly data to set up existing workload char-
     acteristics (for example, relatively stable levels or increasing and decreasing trends). Assure the his-
     torical workload counts are verified. To analyze this historical data:
        3.30.2.1. Get at least one full cycle of WLF data.
            3.30.2.1.1. For WLFs that have been routinely reported in the past and have not had a defini-
            tion change, get two to three years of historical data (based on availability). The more data
            used in the analysis, the more confidence the average WLF value inspires.
            3.30.2.1.2. Less than a full cycle of data may be all that is available. If so, use caution in mak-
            ing assumptions about the relevance of averages or trends based on this limited data.
        3.30.2.2. Construct a control chart for each WLF. Plot each month of data and use the mean of all
        data points as the centerline. The upper and lower control limits equal two standard deviations of
        this mean.
        3.30.2.3. Study the control charts. This activity requires the use of common sense, logic, and
        research abilities.
            3.30.2.3.1. First, look at the control chart to pinpoint possible outlying months of data. To find
            the reasons for these workload levels, research past records and discuss this data with the func-
            tional OPR.
                3.30.2.3.1.1. If these months are not representative of the work center and the craftsman
                understands the reasons why they are different (for example, incorrect reporting), exclude
                them and reconstruct the control chart.
                3.30.2.3.1.2. If the values for these months are in error and a corrected value can be accu-
                rately documented and supported, adjust the values for these months and reconstruct the
                control chart.
                3.30.2.3.1.3. If no explanations can be found for the outlying months, assume the data cor-
                rect.
            3.30.2.3.2. If research shows that an extraordinary situation existed that caused most of the
            historical data for a work center to be nonrepresentative, then adjust reported workload data to
            more accurately show the workload levels. After this has been done, give a full explanation of
            the situation and how adjusted workload values were computed.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                              97


     3.30.2.4. Make conclusions about the WLF data. The craftsman looks at the control chart to see
     how the points are distributed about the mean after validating the data.
         3.30.2.4.1. If points are evenly distributed about the mean, this shows relative workload sta-
         bility. When logic supports this conclusion, use the mean as the workload value.
         3.30.2.4.2. If the points show a steadily increasing or decreasing trend, this may show a
         slowly evolving change in work center workload.
             3.30.2.4.2.1. If thorough research can show that this trend will continue at the same rate,
             get the workload value by averaging only the last three months of data.
             3.30.2.4.2.2. If the trend appears to have leveled off for the last three months at a higher or
             lower level, use that level as the workload value.
     3.30.2.5. Document results of the historical workload analysis. Each base included in the trial
     impact application will document its data as directed by the study team.
  3.30.3. Work Center Manpower Requirements.
     3.30.3.1. Once workload values are collected and verified for the baseline fiscal quarter, use this
     workload in the standard man-hour equation to find work center manpower requirements.
     3.30.3.2. As part of the work center trial application, include the military and civilian mix. Use
     military essentiality as the prime consideration for setting up this mix. AFI 38-204 states the basic
     policy for identifying when manpower must be military and when it can be civilian. Since the
     results of the trial impact application show the unconstrained manpower requirements of a work
     center, do not consider current funding ceilings when determining this mix. If application of the
     military essentiality criteria would dictate a change in this ratio, there is no need to keep an exist-
     ing ratio between military and civilian manpower. However, if the trial impact application is being
     done by the study team, use existing ratios or HQ USAF guidance as a guide for estimating how
     increases or decreases in work center manpower requirements impact the military and civilian
     mix.
     3.30.3.3. Some work centers may have part of their workload done by contract personnel. Make
     an adjustment for the contracted work since standard application results in manpower require-
     ments for in-house personnel. Make this adjustment by subtracting a contract manpower equiva-
     lent value from the standard application man-hours. See Figure 3.17.
         3.30.3.3.1. Contract manpower equivalents are the number of equivalent man-hours required
         if the contracted workload was done in-house.
         3.30.3.3.2. Get contract manpower equivalent man-hours by multiplying the contract man-
         power equivalents shown in the UMD by the pertinent normal workweek civilian MAF.
  3.30.4. Work Center Impact. Ensure the trial impact application includes all bases where the standard
  applies.
  3.30.5. Documenting the Impact Application. The project team files trial application data compiled
  for each base as backup data. The project team assembles the documentation from the trial impact
  application into sections, one for each standard applied. Within each section, there are two parts: the
  trial impact application summaries and the explanation of changes.

        3.30.5.1. Trial Impact Application Summary. The trial impact application summary for an Air
        Force standard consists of a summary for the overall Air Force and a summary for each MAJ-
        COM. For Air Force standards and variances, MAJCOMs furnish AFMIA the trial impact sum-
        mary for each of their bases. MAJCOMs include:
            3.30.5.1.1. Total authorizations for peacetime studies. Use the manpower data system, Cur-
            rent Requirement Authorization Table (less individual mobilization augmentation authoriza-
            tions). To obtain total authorizations for wartime studies, use the manpower data system,
            Current Requirement Authorization Table and the Current Requirement Guard and Reserve
            Table.
            3.30.5.1.2. Workload counts used to price out the basic standard and a list of approved vari-
            ances used to compute total man-hours.
        3.30.5.2. Explanation of Changes. This is a narrative description of the overall impact the stan-
        dard has on the work center. Comment on each of these.
            3.30.5.2.1. What caused the overall increases or decreases in manpower requirement totals:
            increased workload, new work, decreased workload, productivity improvements, or policy
            changes?
            3.30.5.2.2. What does the standard buy in terms of additional capability for the Air Force and
            what would be the result if the standard were not implemented. For example, if a new standard
            in function XXXX is not funded, it may prevent the function from being able to meet wartime
            requirements for critical skills and force the continued use of nonappropriated fund civilians in
            the work center.
     3.30.6. Staffing for Approval. Once all trial applications are assembled, then an overall effect of
     implementing the standard can be presented to the applicable MAJCOM and Air Staff offices. The
     result will be either approval or disapproval for the actual implementation and application of the stan-
     dard or variance.

Section 3G—Coordination And Approval--Phase 6

3.31. General Concepts. A vital link to any improvement process is coordination. Any improvement
action(s) could possibly impact another functional area or areas. Although the action may improve your
process, it could be detrimental to someone else’s process, i.e., degrading someone’s wartime capability.
     3.31.1. Coordination Objectives. Three objectives must be met during this phase: (1) Articulate what
     must be done to effectively staff and coordinate change proposals up to and through the Air Force
     Corporate Structure to obtain senior Air Force leadership approval. (2) Categorize and define changes
     of new process designs, goals, and objectives to achieve envisioned end-state. (3) Show clear linkage
     to Air Force core competencies and demonstrate operationalized quality.
     3.31.2. Project Partner Draft/Revise Strategic Plan.
        3.31.2.1. Goals and objectives necessary to bring about the envisioned state must be developed
        and completed.
        3.31.2.2. Objectives should be measurable and have timelines for translation into action plans.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                         99


     3.31.2.3. Goals and objectives must clearly communicate to leadership, stakeholders, and project
     partners what has to take place in order to bring about the change to the envisioned state.
  3.31.3. Staff Results.
     3.31.3.1. Start at the earliest stages of reengineering.
     3.31.3.2. The Communication Plan developed in Phase 1 and updated throughout each subse-
     quent phase should provide the material necessary to assemble the briefings.
     3.31.3.3. Continue to reinforce what has previously been staffed—demonstrate progress and
     resolve to achieve end state.
     3.31.3.4. Involve all stakeholders which gives the advantage of knowing their positions/ideas and
     nurturing buy-in. This should also include other functions affected by changes made in the process
     methods, e.g., AF/SC for communication changes, AF/LE for equipment or transportation, AF/DP
     for personnel or training, etc.
  3.31.4. Refine Options.
     3.31.4.1. Changes recommended/directed at each level of briefing must be incorporated, if appro-
     priate.
     3.31.4.2. A thorough After Action Review should be completed after briefing each echelon of
     command and appropriate revisions made prior to proceeding to the next level.
  3.31.5. Refine Resource Management Requirements. Based on analysis data compiled throughout
  previous phases, all resource management data should be refined to reflect the most accurate informa-
  tion.
  3.31.6. Present Options to MAJCOMs. The Business Case Analysis, along with the results of options
  analysis and recommendations made at previous briefings, should be presented to senior MAJCOM
  leadership for their concurrence or approval if it is a MAJCOM study.
  3.31.7. Present Option(s)/Recommendations(s) to Corporate Air Force Leaders. Staff results of previ-
  ous briefings through the chain of command and with other Air Force functionals, if necessary, and
  obtain approval from the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS).
  3.31.8. Communicate Decision to Stakeholders:
     3.31.8.1. Once approval has been obtained from the corporate leadership of the Air Force, the
     decision should be transmitted to all concerned members.
     3.31.8.2. Use all available communication means.
     3.31.8.3. The Air Force Public Affairs department can be a helpful partner and provide assistance
     in the dissemination of the information.
  3.31.9. All functional managers will seek corporate structure review and approval for required fund-
  ing levels upon completion of the Seven-Phase Approach review of their processes. Per the Annual
  Planning and Programming Guidance, Air Staff functional managers, in partnership with AFMIA or
  applicable MAJCOM/XPM (for MAJCOM studies), will brief AFCS on the results of their efforts.
  The following paragraphs state the purpose and make-up of the AFSC. Figure 3.21. depicts the orga-
  nizational structure of the AFCS.
100                                                                  AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


3.32. The Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). This portion addresses the details to provide an
in-depth understanding of the key players, organization, relationships, and processes of the AFCS.

Figure 3.21. The Air Force Corporate Structure.




      3.32.1. Panels. The five Mission and nine Mission Support Panels (see Figure 3.20.) are the Air
      Force centers of expertise for their areas, and they are the first level of corporate deliberation in the
      AFCS. The primary purpose of the Panels is to support the resource allocation program. The Panels
      serve as the initial point of entry for issues from the Program Element Monitor, Integrated Process
      Teams (IPTs), MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs which require corporate review. The applicable panel
      will normally be the initial entry into the AFCS for MAJCOM-unique requirements/reengineered
      studies.
      3.32.2. The Air Force Group (AFG). The AFG provides senior-level resolution of resource allocation
      and other issues prior to Air Force Board (AFB) review and is normally the level Air Force manpower
      study results will enter the AFCS process. The AFG develops the overall integrated Air Force pro-
      gram for submission to the AFB. The AFG reviews issues submitted by the Program Objective Mem-
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                        101


   orandum Panels and IPT and forwards significant issues to the AFB. The AFG is the first level of the
   corporate structure that integrates Air Force mission areas into a balanced Air Force program. The
   AFG Chair presents the integrated program to the AFB for refinement. The HQ USAF/XPP Deputy
   chairs the AFG. AFG membership includes Colonel/civilian equivalent membership from the same
   functional areas as the AFB. Figure 3.22. depicts the members of the AFG.

      3.32.2.1. The AFG is the entry point to bring proposals and issues into the AFCS for review. To
      come to the AFG, either a Panel Chair or AFG member must normally sponsor an issue. Again
      this is the level most Air Force studies will enter the Corporate Process.
      3.32.2.2. The AFG oversees all programming activities enroute to the AFB. It receives informa-
      tion briefings needed to analyze programs and develop alternatives and forwards significant and
      critical issues for AFB/AFC review and deliberation. The AFG provides Panels and IPTs with
      feedback and guidance on their activities. The AFG meets at the discretion of the AFG Chair for
      the following purposes:
          3.32.2.2.1. Review program options for compliance with Air Force guidance.
          3.32.2.2.2. Validate cost.
          3.32.2.2.3. Schedule and completeness of program options.
          3.32.2.2.4. Develop new options as needed.
          3.32.2.2.5. Entertain new initiatives to meet core competencies or requirements.
          3.32.2.2.6. Receive briefings as necessary to make informed decisions on Air Force programs.
   3.32.3. The AFB. The AFB provides flag-level (2-star and civilian equivalent) review of resource
   allocation and other issues. The AFB reviews issues submitted by the AFG. The AFB directs the focus
   of the AFG in resolving issues and refines AFG-developed integrated programs for submission to the
   AFC. Topics brought before the AFB should be limited to important matters requiring corporate con-
   sideration and resolution. The AFB is chaired by HQ USAF/XPP except for purposes of budget for-
   mulation and execution. Figure 3.23. depicts the AFB members.

      3.32.4. The Air Force Council (AFC). The AFC provides DCS and Assistant Secretariat level and
      selected Directorate level cross-functional review of resource allocation and other issues. The AFC
      reviews and evaluates programs and issues, guides corporate processes, coordinates functional inter-
      ests, and tasks the other members of the AFCS. It is the final AFCS body and makes recommendations
      to the CSAF and SECDEF. The AFC chair is the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CV). Figure 3.24.
      depicts the two-digit members of the AFC.

      3.32.5. Integrated Process Teams (IPTs). The IPTs comprise the multifunctional working-level
      infrastructure and information network that supports both the AFCS as well as the functional staff.
      IPTs bring together functional expertise into a cross-functional team as the single point of contact for
      a specific program, process, or issue that requires corporate review. IPTs develop and recommend
      options for a designated program, process, or issue based on corporate guidance. IPTs apply func-
      tional expertise to corporate problems, maintain a knowledge base of the issues, and advise functional
      chain issues/resolution options as they develop. The ultimate goals of IPTs in the AFCS are to
      improve communication across the staff, develop a “single face” or POC for our customers, and insti-
      tutionalize a corporate approach to decision making throughout the Air Force.

Section 3H—Implementation—Phase 7

3.33. General Concepts. How does one implement a new process or processes? There is no text book
answer. Several things impact implementation, including money. Does the new process require new
equipment (which spawns new training)? If new equipment is involved, it will have to be budgeted for.
Implementing the new process will take time. This phase is the longest of the seven to complete. All the
affected players, i.e., employees, customers, and stakeholders, must go through the initial growing pains
of adjusting to the new process. The following are steps towards implementation:
      3.33.1. Implementation Objectives.
         3.33.1.1. Functional is postured to implement change.
         3.33.1.2. Functional recognizes importance of continuous communication on implementation.
         3.33.1.3. Functional has effective performance measures in place.
         3.33.1.4. Develop manpower determinant for new processes.
      3.33.2. Posture Project team to Implement.
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                            103


       3.33.2.1. This activity will require the consultation team to provide advice, fine tune processes
       and costs, and recommend sources to address implementation issues.
       3.33.2.2. Actions may vary from coordination to personnel actions, facilities, training, timelines,
       reorganization actions, budget, technological integration, future processes, resources, etc.
   3.33.3. Extend or Revise Communication Plan.
       3.33.3.1. Helps satisfy people’s need to understand what expectations are.
       3.33.3.2. Feedback helps prevent bottlenecks.
       3.33.3.3. Communicates changes for contingencies.
   3.33.4. Institutionalize Performance Measures.
       3.33.4.1. Product or service oriented/customer focused.
       3.33.4.2. Standards and stretch goals established.
       3.33.4.3. Reporting and feedback mechanisms in place.
   3.33.5. Finalize/Update Manpower Standard(s)/Variance(s).
       3.33.5.1. Process oriented.
       3.33.5.2. Rooted in mission essential task lists.
       3.33.5.3. Programmable workload factor?
   3.33.6. Share Results/Benchmarks. Provide project results throughout the Air Force and the lessons
   learned database (best practices database).
   3.33.7. Be Prepared for Counter-implementation Tactics.
       3.33.7.1. Passive resistance (verbal agreement but with no action)
       3.33.7.2. Diverting promised resources away from the project.
       3.33.7.3. Cooperating, but with the wrong information.
       3.33.7.4. Exaggerating minor technical issues.
       3.33.7.5. Not showing up for meetings.
       3.33.7.6. Spreading rumors.

3.34. Plan to Implement. After going through the time-consuming process of improving your func-
tion’s activities, you would expect the function to run smoother, demand fewer resources, and allow you
to provide world-class service to your customers. After all you did go out to the “Best in Class” organiza-
tions in government and the private sector and model the way their processes were designed. So, should
not your function be world-class? Maybe not!
   3.34.1. Even though you have followed all of the steps of the Seven-Phase Approach and you have
   really improved your processes, there may be a problem achieving savings or gaining the efficiencies
   you were expecting.
   3.34.2. One of the biggest reasons why some process improvement projects do not achieve the level
   of success the organization expects deals with the issue of organization culture. You can have the
104                                                                   AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


      most efficient process in the world, on paper or in a model, and still not have a “world-class” opera-
      tion. We must remember that people have to execute the plans, perform the activities, and provide the
      interface to the customer. If you have left out of the improvement process a plan on how to change the
      behavior of the human resource, your project will not succeed.
      3.34.3. Culture change does not come only as a result of a change in the system. It comes as a result
      of consistent (incremental) change in the way a person feels about that system. Human beings must
      see that there is less pain and more pleasure (benefit) associated with the changing with than not
      changing.
      3.34.4. When an organization is planning a change of any kind that will affect the day-to-day activi-
      ties of people, the relationship between pain (emotional cost) and pleasure (benefit to the individual)
      in a person’s mind must be considered. Human beings are stimulated (or held back) based on their
      association of personal benefit or personal cost to a change in their environment. As a person is faced
      with change, he will evaluate or question whether or not making the change will cost a great deal in
      emotional stability or provide a great deal of personal benefit. It is this relationship that determines
      real, lasting change in a person.
      3.34.5. Before we go any further, let’s define what we mean by pain and pleasure in the context of
      organizational culture. Everything we as human beings do in our daily lives is based on two things:
      our avoidance of pain or our quest for pleasure. What do we mean? Pain is the feeling of dread a per-
      son feels when faced with a new situation. Pleasure, on the other hand, is the benefit or sense of
      accomplishment, satisfaction, contentment, or happiness a person feels as a result of being in the situ-
      ation they are in.

3.35. Reactions to Change.
      3.35.1. Shock. Once a change has been announced, usually the first reaction people have is to meet
      the change with a sense of shock. They ask themselves, “Where did this come from?”, “What is going
      on?”, “I did not know anything about this!”, or “This is not what I agreed to!”
      3.35.2. Anger. After you have gotten over the shock of the new situation, most people, if they view
      the change as a negative impact on their personal situation, become very angry. Many times they will
      begin a process of looking for the person or persons to blame. They may begin to talk about the new
      situation in very negative terms, such as, “It will not work!” or I’m not going to support this!” This
      anger, if not addressed, may lead to some people trying to sabotage the change process.
      3.35.3. Denial. This phase is a little harder to define. Many people, depending on their basic values
      and beliefs, go directly from anger to the fourth phase, acceptance. However, there are a significant
      number of people who go through a denial phase, so it is necessary to show you what to look for. A
      person going through this phase will make up excuses why he should not be held accountable for any-
      thing that goes wrong with the organization as a result of the change. For example, he may make the
      excuse, “The change will never work because I have not been directly involved with the solution!” or
      “Do not blame me if it does not work!” These attempts to disassociate himself or herself from the new
      situation often cause the person to alienate himself or herself from the group.
      3.35.4. Acceptance. Only after a person gets through the first phases can he/she truly begin to accept
      the change that is taking place. Once the person has accepted the change as real and that it is going to
      happen, he/she begins to rationalize their role in the new situation. It is extremely important for you to
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                           105


  understand that people will go through each of these phases, in varying degrees, as they transition
  from the old way of doing business to the new. How we manage this transition period is the key.
  3.35.5. What can we do to manage this transition? Change cannot be accomplished without the com-
  mitment and involvement of the organization’s leaders. We have talked about how important leader-
  ship is in the Seven-Phase Approach. As we transition from an old way of doing business to a new
  way of doing business, leadership becomes the glue that will hold the organization together. Let’s
  look at the role a leader should play during the change process. Leaders must have an assured (and
  unwaiverable) way of thinking about change.
     3.35.5.1. They should have a “model” that will guide analysis of the situation and help them to
     formulate the process of change to be implemented. Leaders must have clear goals.
     3.35.5.2. They must have a clear idea of what results the change will generate.
         3.35.5.2.1. Leaders should initiate change at the point where they have the most control and
         can make reliable predictions about the consequences of their actions.
         3.35.5.2.2. Leaders should recognize that change in any one part of the situation affects the
         whole.
         3.35.5.2.3. They must be alert for unanticipated consequences of their actions.
     3.35.5.3. The most important task of a leader is creating the climate that is conducive to the
     change being attempted. An emotional atmosphere in which people feel that the leader is empa-
     thetic and nonjudgmental toward the employees and their needs is a climate in which people will
     be more open about their needs and a climate in which people will be more open about their feel-
     ings and resistance.
  3.35.6. Implementation Strategies. Change is itself a process and must be treated as such. An organi-
  zation cannot expect people to change the way they have done things for years overnight. Change is
  not something that should be taken lightly. It is complex and, if managed properly, can be very bene-
  ficial to the employees and the organization as a whole.
     3.35.6.1. Proper management of the transition of people through the process of change is critical
     to the success of the new system. There are three aspects to the transition of people through
     change.
         3.35.6.1.1. Discontinuation of the old way of doing business. The first aspect of the transition
         is the discontinuation of the old way of doing business. This sounds simple, but it is not. It is
         during this part of the transition that many of the reactions to the change are experienced. So
         how do you get people to give up the old way?
             3.35.6.1.1.1. Identify who is losing what.
             3.35.6.1.1.2. Accept the reality and importance of subjective losses.
             3.35.6.1.1.3. Don’t be surprised at overreaction.
             3.35.6.1.1.4. Acknowledge losses openly and sympathetically.
             3.35.6.1.1.5. Expect and accept signs of grieving. Do everything possible to restore peo-
             ple’s sense of having some control over their situation.
             3.35.6.1.1.6. Compensate for losses.

         3.35.6.1.1.7. Give people information-- over and over again.
         3.35.6.1.1.8. Define what is over and what isn’t.
         3.35.6.1.1.9. Avoid dragging it out -- whatever must end, must end.
      3.35.6.1.2. Migration. Migration is the in-between part of the transition. You have let go of
      the old way but you have not quite gotten to the point of fully grasping the new way. It is like
      being on a trapeze. As you let go of the first trapeze there is a moment before the other trapeze
      gets to you. It is during that time that you have nothing to hold on to. It is also during that time
      that many questions may go through the trapeze artist’s mind, things like, “ Was this a wise
      thing to do?” or “Will I be able to catch the other trapeze?” This can be a very difficult time,
      yet it can be a very innovative and creative time. Some things to look for:
         3.35.6.1.2.1. Anxiety/absenteeism/old weaknesses and wounds emerge.
         3.35.6.1.2.2. People are overloaded; systems are unreliable; signals get mixed.
         3.35.6.1.2.3. Teamwork is undermined; people take sides; old way/new way.
         3.35.6.1.2.4. Organizations and people are vulnerable to attacks from outside--defenses
         are weakened.
         3.35.6.1.2.5. The way to get through this phase is to:
             3.35.6.1.2.5.1. Recognize this behavior is “normal” and expected.
             3.35.6.1.2.5.2. Create temporary systems or ways to deal with this period.
             3.35.6.1.2.5.3. Protect your people.
             3.35.6.1.2.5.4. Review policies and regulations. Make sure they are flexible enough to
             deal with the changes taking place.
             3.35.6.1.2.5.5. Strengthen and encourage intra-group connections.
             3.35.6.1.2.5.6. Communicate, keep the people informed. Be open and honest about the
             affects of changes being made.
      3.35.6.1.3. Starting the new way of doing business.
         3.35.6.1.3.1. This part of the transition is very important in that it is here that you solidify
         the changes the organization has made. It is here that lasting change takes place. How do I
         reinforce this new beginning?
             3.35.6.1.3.1.1. Be consistent. Be careful of conflicting messages. Walk the talk.
             3.35.6.1.3.1.2. Ensure quick success.
             3.35.6.1.3.1.3. Symbolize the new identity.
             3.35.6.1.3.1.4. Celebrate the success.
         3.35.6.1.3.2. Each of these ideas can be used to reinforce the new behaviors, thus, rein-
         forcing the new processes or ways of doing business.
         3.35.6.1.3.3. These are only a few ideas on how to manage the transition of change in your
         organization. It is important to note that there are many schools of thought on this subject
AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002                                                                             107


              but all have a common theme--open and honest communication is essential throughout the
              transition.

Section 3I—Man-hour Credit for Deployment Participation.

3.36. General Concepts. Deployment of forces in support of Operational Plans, Aerospace Expedition-
ary Forces, Military Operations Other Than War, exercises and training events are activities generally
accepted for participation credit.
   3.36.1. Work centers participating in these activities can only receive man-hour credit for participa-
   tion in deployments meeting all of the listed criteria:
       3.36.1.1. Are directed by MAJCOM or higher headquarters.
       3.36.1.2. Are not categorized as in-lieu-of (ILO) forces. When the traditional force provider for
       the requested force or capability cannot fill the requirement a request to the Air Force is initiated
       and a sourcing solution is developed if applicable. These taskings are identified as ILOs.
       3.36.1.3. Require only a part of the total number of work center personnel to take part. (An exam-
       ple of this is when only three people in a 20-person work center deploy.)
       3.36.1.4. Participating personnel are on official Contingency, Exercise, or Deployment (CED)
       orders and away from the normal work center area for a period exceeding 20 continuous days.
       This eliminates sporadic, short-term deployments such as Top Dollar, Eagle Flag, Readiness Chal-
       lenge, area of responsibility (AOR) site visits, etc. that do not place an undue stress on the work
       center.
       3.36.1.5. Do not result in the rotating of personnel between the normal work center area and a
       deployment site that is permanently manned by the work center. Account for this workload in the
       core POD.
       3.36.1.6. Demonstrate and document a recurring need. Historical participation data for the most
       recent 10 completed AEF rotations is needed to build confidence that the workload is constant.
       3.36.1.7. Functions not covered under the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM) may be consid-
       ered when computing deployment participation man-hours. Exclude contingency response func-
       tions whose peacetime mission is solely to train and prepare for their contingency missions.
       Coordinate with the functional area manager (FAM) to determine if this is applicable to the func-
       tion under study. See Table 3.10. for a listing of applicable functions .

  3.36.2. Calculate deployment participation man-hour credit using Table 3.11.
     3.36.2.1. The computed man-hours account for individuals on official CED orders participating in
     the deployment and gives applicable credit for the man-hours lost by the work center.
     3.36.2.2. Source of count for deployment data is the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and
     Execution Segment (DCAPES) Deployed Personnel History Database. To normalize the rota-
     tional fluctuations occurring with each AEF pair and across the AEF cycle, obtain deployed his-
     tory data equal to 10-completed AEF rotations. This will account for a minimum of two cycles.
     Note: Contact AFMA/MASR if DCAPES is not available at your location.
     3.36.2.3. Do not include days for personnel deployed along with, and assigned to, their own home
     station’s equipment i.e. fire protection vehicles, aerospace ground equipment (AGE), etc. The
     home-station workload associated to the equipment is deployed from the work center along with
     the support personnel. Coordinate with the FAM to determine if this is applicable to the AFSC
     under study.
     3.36.2.4. Do not include post-deployment rest days. Rest days are given based on mission needs
     and are not mandatory.
     3.36.2.5. In addition, work center personnel in a non-deployment status are expected to work at
     the wartime surge conditions, when necessary, to offset temporary (20 continuous days or less )
     deployment impact.

 10          Add monthly man-hours to CMS to determine total manpower requirements.

NOTES:

                    SEVEN-PHASE APPROACH CRITERIA DELIVERABLES

4.1. General Concepts. This criteria is developed as a means to support the assumptions/conclusions in
the validation process regardless of who performs the study, (e.g., In-house or Contractor). It is an advan-
tage to use the criteria as a guide when performing projects using the Seven-Phase Approach.

4.2. The Criteria. Each of the areas listed below should be addressed in a study project. The detail
required is dependent upon the complexity and scope of the project, and deliverable products may com-
bine areas as deemed appropriate for each study. If the project does not include/cover an element, an
attempt should be made to explain why the element was not addressed and the impact of its absence on the
overall reengineering effort. Forward rationale for non-inclusion to HQ USAF/XPMR, with info copy to
AFMIA/MIR.

Terms
Benchmarking.—The process of finding and adapting best practices to improve organizational
performance.
116                                                              AFMAN38-208V1 29 MARCH 2002


Case for Change.—Defining and articulating the reason for improvement(s).
Comparative Analysis.—Evaluating performance difference and the magnitude of the difference
between the project organization and the goal or target that’s trying to be achieved.
Customers.—Anyone for whom an organization or individual provides goods or services.
Environmental Scan.—Looking for possible factors, technologies, or trends affecting the current or
future organization/process or may affect the future organization/process.
Five Fronts.—Organizational areas that interrelate and must be considered during any improvement
project: organization/people, technology, policies, physical infrastructure, and the process.
Input.—Products and/or services received from suppliers in order to perform a process.
Key Process.—The major system level that supports the mission and satisfies major customer
requirements.
Macro.—A more holistic improvement effort often focusing on dramatic results.
Micro.—Improvement efforts focused on a small organizational scope.
Mid-level.—Improvement efforts involving more processes, may be restrictive to a function or a
department.
Mission.—The reason for an organization’s existence.
Primary Research.—Searching for information about a particular item using direct sources by making
direct contact with the source.
Process.—Linked activities with the purpose of producing a product or service for a customer. Typically
involves a combination of people, machines, tools, techniques and materials in a systemic series of steps
or actions.
Quick Win.—Minor improvement options implemented without little or no coordination. Can be done in
the As-Is phase.
Secondary Research.—Searching for information about a particular subject using indirect sources such
as books, newspapers, World Wide Web, etc.
Seven-Phase Approach.—A guideline designed to be flexible and adaptable to organizational needs and
study scope and not meant to be a restrictive and inflexible checklist.
SWOT Analysis.—Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. By examining strengths, a project
team can discover untapped potential. By examining weaknesses, a project team can identify gaps in
performance, vulnerabilities, and erroneous assumptions about their existing strategies. Strengths (what
are we good at) and weaknesses (what are we not good at) are internal factors affecting a unit. The
external opportunities and threats are the positive and negative characteristics of the external
environment. Examples: Strength: Competitive Advantage; Weakness: Reduced Workforce;
Opportunities: Increased taskings; Threat: Loss of primary mission.
