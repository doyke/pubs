SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The original
instruction only addressed Survival and Code of Conduct (CoC) Training. In this revision,
continuation training was added to the CoC section and four chapters were added addressing
general program information, Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support, career field
management, and SERE program evaluation and inspection.

(AMC) This document is revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision is a
compilation and consolidation of information formerly contained in previous AFI 16-1301, AMC
Supplement, dated 28 February 2011. In this revision, continuation training requirements were
updated to reflect changes to the SERE training curriculum, course S-V80-A initial SERE
training. Change also reflects guidance identified in “Implementation of Updated SERE
Instructor Guides” memorandum from AMC/A3D dated 06 Aug 2010.

                           THE AIR FORCE SERE PROGRAM

1.1. General Issues. This instruction:
   1.1.1. Applies to all MAJCOMs and ANG.
   1.1.2. Defines minimum Code of Conduct Training (CoCT) and Code of Conduct
   Continuation Training (CoCCT) requirements for United States Air Force (USAF) personnel.
   1.1.3. Lists overall Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support responsibilities and defines
   roles and duties of Air Force SERE Specialists (1T000/1T0X1) in support of PR.
   1.1.4. Defines roles and responsibilities for SERE Specialist career field management.
   1.1.5. Defines procedures for evaluating and inspecting key aspects of the Air Force SERE
   Program.
1.2. Program Explanation:
   1.2.1. This instruction describes the Air Force SERE Program as a function within DoD PR.
   The Air Force SERE program encompasses CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support
   required to enable military, civilian, contractor, and other designated personnel to return to
   friendly control after isolation due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other unforeseen
   events. The sole purpose of the AF SERE Program is to support PR operations through
   education, training, and operational support activities. Specifically, the Universal Joint Task
   List (UJTL), Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMTEL), and applicable Air Force tasks for
   conducting personnel recovery operations drive SERE Program requirements. Doctrinally,
   the PR continuum is comprised of education and training, mission planning, execution,
   tracking, debriefing, repatriating, and applying applicable lessons learned. The SERE
   Program begins and closes the PR continuum beginning with initial SERE training and
   culminating with repatriation.
   1.2.2. CoCT Goals and Objectives.
       1.2.2.1. The goal of CoCT is to prepare personnel to return with honor, regardless of the
       circumstances of isolation.
       1.2.2.2. The objective of CoCT is to provide a clear and direct SERE/PR linkage from
       initial through refresher and continuation training, exercises, and combat operations to
       ensure efficient training and effective support occur throughout the member's career.
       1.2.2.3. The Code of Conduct (CoC) is the foundation underpinning the warfighter’s
       PR/SERE preparation and training. AF CoCT programs must prepare USAF personnel
       for all forms of modern contingencies, from wartime to Operations Other Than War
       (OOTW).
       1.2.2.4. Any event that places any US forces member in a situation where he or she is
       isolated and no longer in friendly control triggers the need for PR. These triggering
       events can occur through hostile enemy actions during OOTW, terrorist actions, or as a
       result of natural or manmade conditions. The Air Force SERE Program is an integral part
       of an organized PR effort among several related functions.
 6                                                 AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013


        1.2.2.5. AF SERE program must provide the necessary PR information prior to and
        during contingency operations to USAF personnel at risk of capture. Isolated personnel
        increase their chance of an expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when
        they are trained to perform PR Joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (JTTPs).

        require flying and are not considered Career Enlisted Aviators or rated officers.
        2.2.2.4.3. Third Priority: Operational support personnel whose duties require SERE
        CoCT experience to augment SERE CoCCT and PR operational support programs.
        2.2.2.4.3. (AMC) PR operational support personnel include Intelligence and
        Aircrew Flight Equipment. To enhance PR mission core competency, both are highly
        encouraged to attend S-V80-A using fallout slots. Respective branch chiefs should
        send fallout slot requests to: a3t.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
        2.2.2.4.4. HQ USAF/A3OS may reprioritize personnel in response to real-world
        contingencies and/or constraints.

        USAF/A3OS.
        2.2.2.4.6. HQ AETC/DOR has the authority to replace any lower priority student
        with a higher priority student for AETC’s formal SERE CoCT courses. All changes
        will be coordinated with the affected SERE MFM prior to implementation.
     2.2.2.5. Any unfilled training quotas not sub-allocated 30 days prior to class start date
     may be utilized by any authorized attendee. Authorized attendees will request unused
     allocations through their respective SERE MFMs to HQ AETC/DOR.

      2.2.4.5. SERE MFMs and designated units can obtain level-B, Wartime Code of Conduct
      Series, Peacetime Governmental and Peacetime Hostage Detention CoCT tapes by
      contacting AF/A3OS with their requirements.
2.3. Code of Conduct Continuation Training (CoCCT) Program Management:
   2.3.1. CoCCT Intent:
      2.3.1.1. CoCCT is a combination of refresher CoCT and additional theater specific
      Contingency SERE Indoctrination (CSI) training. Frequency and depth of training are
      based on missions conducted (and associated perceived threats) of personnel requiring
      training. MAJCOMs and the ANG will tailor curriculum and training to meet minimum
      requirements levied by this publication and IAW combatant command guidance.
      2.3.1.2. CoCCT is designed to ensure personnel maintain critical SERE skills gained at
      formal SERE training courses and to tailor SERE skills for specific aircraft, missions, and
      deployed locations.
      2.3.1.3. (Added-AMC) Equipment used during all CoCCT events will mirror
      operational equipment carried aboard assigned MDS to greatest extent possible. Training
      equipment will be properly maintained in accordance with applicable T.O. and
      instructions.
      2.3.1.4. (Added-AMC) An Operating Instruction (OI) will be developed detailing how
      the CoCCT program will be conducted. The OI will be coordinated with any agency (e.g.
      Weapons/Tactics, Intelligence, AFE) that assists SERE personnel in providing training to
      crews. The OI will be approved by the Operations Group Commander or equivalent and
      should include, at a minimum:
          2.3.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) Training schedule process
          2.3.1.4.2. (Added-AMC) Operational Risk Management
          2.3.1.4.3. (Added-AMC) No-show for training policy
          2.3.1.4.4. (Added-AMC) CoCCT event processes
   2.3.2. CoCCT Instructors:
   2.3.2. (AMC) CoCCT Instructors: AMC wing 1T0X1 SERE Specialists will be aligned
   under wing tactics (OSK) for operational reasons, with the office symbol OSKP. If there is
   no established tactics office, align them functionally under operations to comply with the
   intent (to include SIPR access and a classified work environment). To comply with AFPD
   10-30, the wing SERE Specialist is the OPR for all wing PR matters and communicates with
   the AMC Functional Manager as the HQ AMC PR OPR. OSK must communicate with wing
   training to ensure SERE ground training events are met.
      2.3.2.1. IAW DoDI 1300.21, the Air Force is "responsible for identifying and qualifying
      CoC and SERE training specialists."
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                         19


     2.3.2.2. 1T0X1, SERE Specialists are the only Air Force specialty specifically recruited,
     trained, and employed to conduct SERE operations support, CoCT, and CoCCT for the
     duration of their career.
     2.3.2.3. Where SERE specialists aren't assigned, available, or additional manpower is
     required, SERE MFMs in coordination with affected MFMs may authorize other
     designated personnel to support this requirement. All CoCCT instructors will be
     qualified and certified IAW SERE training plans. The SERE MFM will coordinate
     MAJCOM specific training requirements for unit level CoCCT instructors with the
     respective MFM(s) for inclusion into their Master JQS/CFETP.
     2.3.2.3. (AMC) AMC non-SERE augmentees conducting this training must have
     additional training to conduct SS-02 CST, SS-05 WST and SS-06 EPT. See Attachment
     6 for CoCCT Augmentee/Support Personnel Training Plan. This additional training does
     not apply to augmentees filling a non-teaching capacity. If the SERE Specialist is
     deployed and no augmentee is certified, OG/CCs may grant a waiver until the SERE
     Specialist or certified augmentee returns. Non-SERE augmentees may not teach SS-03
     Conduct After Capture.
     2.3.2.4. (Added-AMC) If SERE Specialists are deploying, leaving no SERE
     Specialist/CoCCT capability at home station, all CoCCT required during the planned
     duration of the deployment should be accomplished prior to departure.
         2.3.2.4.1. (Added-AMC) When base-level SERE Specialists are one-deep, the
         posturing or “P” code will be changed to “DWX” to prevent deploying that base’s
         only SERE capability except for extreme emergencies. If base-level SERE Specialists
         are deployed for more than 30 days leaving no SERE Specialist capability at home
         station, AMC (upon unit request) will assist the unit in gaining SERE augmentees to
         cover scheduled CST, WST and CAC training events during the deployment period.
         If a unit requests this assistance, unit funds will be used to accommodate the TDYs.
         Waivers should only be used as a last resort and align with applicable MDS 11-2
         series, Vol 1 guidance. If necessary, waivers are automatically granted for CST,
         WST, and CAC training events until a qualified SERE augmentee arrives at home
         station or the SERE Specialist returns from deployment, whichever occurs first.
         Aircrew must accomplish all waived training events within 60 days of a SERE
         augmentee arriving on base or the SERE Specialist returning to home station,
         whichever occurs first. EPT will not be waived and must be completed on or before
         the due date by a certified instructor.
     2.3.2.5. (Added-AMC) The Operations Group Commander is responsible for the local
     SERE Program and therefore the local SERE Specialist must communicate the status of
     the SERE Program to their leadership. The SERE Specialist should provide a quarterly
     briefing on the status of SERE operations and training to the OSS/CC.
  2.3.3. Exceptions to Continuation/Refresher Training Events.
     2.3.3.1. If deploying to a location where a CoCCT training capability does not exist,
     training must be accomplished prior to departure.
20                                              AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013


     2.3.3.2. If deployed to a location where a training capability doesn't exist and the
     individual becomes due CoCCT, training must be accomplished within 60 days of return
     to home station.
     2.3.3.3. Personnel arriving from permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty
     (TDY) during a period when combat survival or water survival training is not available
     (i.e., winter months, pool unavailable) are automatically granted a waiver to this
     requirement until 60 days following the first available training date. However,
     individuals will attend the academic portions of training at the earliest opportunity.
  2.3.4. CoCCT Instructional Blocks:
  2.3.4. (AMC) CoCCT Instructional Blocks: AMC tailored Instructor Guides (IGs) will be
  maintained by the AMC SERE Functional and published on the USAF SERE web at:
  https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/ClosedCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AE-07.
  Users must establish an account. IGs can also be requested through the HQ AMC/A3D
  organizational email.
     2.3.4.1. Local Area Survival (LAS):
         2.3.4.1.1. LAS is a one-time requirement prior to first flight at every assignment.
         Personnel who PCS and then return for subsequent assignments must accomplish this
         training during each reassignment.
         2.3.4.1.1. (AMC) LAS will be taught by a live instructor, and cannot be conducted
         through CBTs. Wings will incorporate Combat Survivor, Evader, Locator (CSEL)
         radio indoctrination training into SS01 as their CSEL capability stands up. CSEL
         hands-on operational training will also be included into SS-02 Combat SERE
         Training (CST).
         2.3.4.1.2. LAS provides local standard operating procedures preparing aircrew for
         possible aircraft emergencies near the base of assignment. As a minimum, the
         following objectives must be satisfied:
            2.3.4.1.2.1. Identify environmental aspects affecting a survivor during local-area
            flying operations.
            2.3.4.1.2.2. Determine personnel recovery tactics, techniques, and procedures
            applicable to local area flying operations.
     2.3.4.2. Combat Survival Training (CST):
         2.3.4.2.1. Frequency. Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR) and
         personnel assigned to combat-coded units will receive CST on a triennial basis. CST
         must be completed prior to awarding MR status.
         2.3.4.2.1. (AMC) Frequency. Mission Ready (MR) individuals and personnel
         assigned/attached to combat-coded units will receive CST every 36 months. 36 month
         currency requirement starts from last accomplishment of training date, either formal
         school or continuation training.
         2.3.4.2.2. MAJCOMs will tailor training based on mission, type of aircraft, and level
         of risk (combat aircraft vs. transport aircraft requirements vs. special operations).
         Aircrew will demonstrate proficiency in TTP for survival and recovery under field
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                         21


        conditions, while in a simulated combat environment using weapons system specific
        survival equipment. This training is designed to enforce learning objectives through
        hands-on experiential training. As a minimum, the following objectives must be
        satisfied:
        2.3.4.2.2. (AMC) All students during the field exercise must be able to
        communicate with the SERE Staff by radio, and a medical contingency response plan

     2.3.4.7. Contingency SERE Indoctrination (CSI):
        2.3.4.7.1. CSI is a combatant command-directed activity and is designed to prepare
        HRC personnel deploying to a specific theater of operations or contingency. CSI will
        be tailored to the specific mission, e.g., fighters, transport aircraft, or ground forces.
        Combatant commands will certify selected SERE specialists to instruct HRC theater
        preparations. CSI is also referred to as HRC theater preparation.
        2.3.4.7.1. (AMC) Unless otherwise directed by combatant commands, AMC defines
        High Risk of Isolation (HRI) as: “aircrews, and unique deep reconnaissance units that
        have a higher risk of isolation and potential for subsequent exploitation.” Personnel
        status as HRI is further defined as: “personnel specifically trained, resourced, and
        intentionally employed forward of the Forward Line of Troops (FLOT) or in or over
        denied battlespace occupied by hostile or enemy forces.” Specifically, this applies to
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                          25


          those identified AFSCs required to attend S-V80-A level-C Combat SERE Training
          in Table 2.1. All other AMC deployed personnel are considered Moderate Risk of
          Isolation or MRI.
          2.3.4.7.2. CSI should be accomplished within 60 days prior to deployment.
          2.3.4.7.2. (AMC) CSI is also known as High Risk of Isolation (HRI) and is AOR-
          specific pre-deployment “just in time” training and is not currency training.

                 SERE SPECIALIST CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT

4.1. Other SERE Specialist Missions and Responsibilities. This chapter addresses general
mission employment, training requirements, physical fitness standards, and additional issues not
discussed in other documents such as in the SERE Specialty Description in AFMAN 36-2108,
training requirements in the CFETP, or other AFIs. SERE specialists will be qualified as a
worldwide deployable resource capable of supporting operations in any theater as a SME in
support of PR/SERE operations.
4.2. Parachuting Program:
   4.2.1. SERE personnel conduct static line and military free fall (MFF) operations.
   Sustainability for parachute program includes basic, senior and master parachutists, and
   upgrade to MFF jumpmaster throughout the AFSC. SERE specialists will implement and
   maintain their Personnel Parachute Program IAW AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute
   Operations. MAJCOMs will establish specific command requirements to support aircrew
   emergency parachuting activities.
       4.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) SERE Specialists will maintain an informal jump record folder
       (JRF) which contains current copies of the following documents: aeronautical orders, AF
       Form 1042, AF Form 797 & 1098, all parachute training and evaluation documents, AF
       Form 922 and/or 4323, and copies of formal parachute training diplomas and/or
       certifications.
   4.2.2. SERE specialist parachutist duty requirements include performing and instructing
   emergency egress, emergency parachute systems, and aircrew emergency parachuting during
   initial SERE CoCT and CoCCT programs. NOTE: As reflected in paragraph 2.3.4.6.4 of
   this instruction, primary instructors for this training will be graduates of a US military
   parachutist course and freefall experience is highly desired.
   4.2.2. (AMC) OG commanders will ensure funds are available for assigned SERE
   Specialists who are jump qualified, to accomplish a minimum of one jump per quarter, or
   four jumps per year for each parachute qualification (static-line/freefall) held to maintain
   proficiency and skill progression.
   4.2.3. Advanced parachuting skills may be required for SERE specialist parachutist duties
   including: performance in developmental/operational testing of experimental parachuting
   systems, aircraft parachutist deployment testing, and emergency egress with associated
   SERE/aircrew life support equipment; instructor duties at the Army Military Freefall School;
   and EPT for PR exercise mission accomplishment.
   4.2.4. Advanced skills take years of training that require parachutist skills to be
   supplemented with proficiency training integrated into all MAJCOMs. The goal of
   proficiency training is to provide expertise for advance parachutist experience requirements
   and to provide a stable force ready for advanced parachutist positions.
   4.2.5. HQ AFMC's Test Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB CA provides
   intentional aircrew emergency parachuting qualification training for conducting
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                            35

   aircrew emergency bailout procedures/operations.
4.3. SERE Specialist Qualification Training Program:
   4.3.1. SERE specialists must perform challenging training and exercise activities and must
   be mission ready for worldwide deployment. Therefore, all personnel must maintain the
   capability to provide SERE training regardless of climatic and environmental conditions. All
   SERE specialists, 5-skill level and higher, will maintain mission ready status by reviewing
   and performing the following proficiency/currency requirements using the associated CFETP
   core task and line items as the baseline for refresher training. Method of refresher training
   accomplishment will be MAJCOM directed:
   4.3.1. (AMC) Multiple refresher training requirements should be combined into one trip or
   TDY to ensure cost effective budgeting, i.e. supporting a Red Flag exercise as an Observer
   Controller could provide credit for both biome (desert) and navigation proficiency
   requirements.
       4.3.1.1. Land Navigation - Biennial.
       4.3.1.2. Medical - Biennial. Training will include emergency first aid refresher and
       include performance of ground search and emergency rough land patient transport and

       4.3.1.3. Environmental/Biome - Biennial.
       4.3.1.4. Conduct after capture guidance for wartime, peacetime governmental, and
       hostage captivity – Biennial, (unless conducting regular duties as an RT instructor). This
       can be accomplished by observing the RT portion of Combat Survival Training, S-V80-
       A, by monitoring/attending the JPRA Joint Resistance Training Instructor Course
       (JRTIC), or by participating in other similar events or courses.
       4.3.1.4. (AMC) AMC SERE Specialists will budget for and observe S-V80-A course at
       least biennially.
       4.3.1.5. PR JTTP - Biennial. This can be accomplished by deploying for contingency
       operations, performing SERE escort/controller duties in a PR exercise, or through unit
       level training.
       4.3.1.6. (Added-AMC) Proficiency/currency requirements will be tracked on an AF
       IMT 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training and maintained in the
       members AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder (OJT Training Folder) or
       informal training folder.
   4.3.2. (Added-AMC) AMC SERE Specialists supporting aircrew should fly with their
   crews at least once, as a familiarization flight. Use MEP status if required. Objective is to
   follow the crews as they prepare for and plan combat/non-combat support missions so they
   can tailor their training to be current with the crew’s needs.
4.4. Physical Fitness Test:
   4.4.1. Successful execution of the SERE specialist missions requires a high degree of
   physical fitness beginning with entry level training (S-V81-A) and continuing throughout a
   member’s career. The unique SERE mission requires optimum individual performance in
 36                                                AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013


   areas of adverse terrain, every environmental condition, and airborne operations. These
   conditions require mental and physical capabilities be maintained at a high level.
   Commanders will ensure assigned SERE specialists complete at least 5 hours of fitness
   training weekly. Commanders will utilize the following standards to assess and maintain
   overall fitness levels:
   4.4.2. SERE specialists will be assessed annually. The fitness test consists of push-ups, sit-
   ups, pull-ups and 2-mile run. Point values for the events are shown in Table 4.1, Physical
   Fitness Evaluation Criteria. A minimum of 210 points is necessary for satisfactory
   completion. Grading criteria are as follows: 520-395 points = Outstanding, 390-280
   points=Excellent, 275-210 points=Satisfactory. Additionally, an alternate 6-mile ruck march
   or 800-meter swim may be used in lieu of the 2-mile run. Points associated with the 6-mile
   ruck march and 800-meter swim are outlined within the related paragraph. Calisthenics
   events will be tested, one immediately after the other, with approximately a 2-minute time
   rest between events. Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of approximately 10
   minutes is given prior to starting the 2–mile run, 6-mile ruck march or 800-meter swim.
   4.4.2. (AMC) Annual SERE Specialist physical fitness test may be conducted by the unit
   physical fitness monitor or anyone in the member’s chain-of-command. Point calculations for
   annual SERE Specialist physical assessments are completed as follows. Airman completes 55
   pushups, 55 sit-ups, 10 pull-ups and completes his run in 16 minutes. Each of his callisthenic
   exercises are worth 65 points and his run receives 160 points. The calculation of points
   would be 65+65+65+160=355 total points.

     4.4.2.1. Pull–ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise is executed on a pull–up bar.
     The individual grasps the bar with the palms toward the face about shoulder width apart.
     This is a two-count exercise. The exercise begins in the “dead hang” position. Count one,
     pull the body directly upward until the chin is over the bar. Count two, lower the body
     until the body is again in the “dead hang” position. Individuals will not swing
     excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled over the bar. Repeat as many times as
     possible. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in the back and
     biceps muscles.
     4.4.2.2. Sit–ups (time limit: 4 minutes). Start with the back flat on the ground, fingers
     interlocked behind the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90-
     degree angle. Another individual will hold the feet during the exercise. This is a two-
     count exercise. Count one, sit up until the back is vertical to the ground. Count two,
     return to the starting position. There is no authorized rest position. If an individual raises
     buttocks from ground or their fingers are not interlocked behind head during a repetition,
     the repetition is not counted. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance
     in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups.
     4.4.2.3. Push-ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise starts from the front leaning rest
     position. The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together.
     This is a two-count exercise. Count one, flex the elbows, lowering the body until the
     elbows form a 90-degree angle. Count two, raise the body until the elbows are straight
     and locked. Repeat this exercise as many times as possible. Event is stopped if an
     individual touches a knee to the ground. The only authorized rest position is the starting
     position. This exercise is designed to measure the strength and endurance of the chest
     and triceps muscles.
     4.4.2.4. Two-Mile Run. This is performed with running shoes and appropriate athletic
     attire. This event will be performed on flat, level, hard-surfaced terrain. This exercise is
     designed to measure aerobic endurance.
  4.4.3. Substandard Performance. Due to the potential risk to the SERE specialist and
  those they work with, minimum fitness standard must be met in order to control factors
  associated with ORM. SERE specialists who fail to achieve the minimum standard on the
  SERE physical fitness test (SPFT) will satisfactorily complete the entire evaluation within 60
  calendar days of the failure. Those who fail the rstest should not be considered for
  worldwide deployment, field operations under adverse conditions, or airborne duty. A
  review board will be convened after the second failure.
  4.4.3. (AMC) Substandard Performance. Units will inform the SERE MFM within seven
  days if any SERE Specialist fails to satisfactorily complete the SPFT.
  4.4.4. Review Board.
     4.4.4.1. The review board will consist of the unit operations officer, SERE MFM, and
     one senior enlisted SERE specialist designated by the SERE MFM.
     4.4.4.2. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a situation and
     provide an impartial judgment.

      4.4.4.3. The review board will determine the circumstances and adequacy of training and
      submit recommendations to the commander for further action. Recommendations may
      include additional supervised training, counseling, or other administrative actions. Board
      findings will be maintained on file for 18 months.
   4.4.5. Temporary Profiles. A member with a temporary profile must take the regular four-
   event fitness test after the profile has expired. (Members with temporary profiles of more
   than 3 months may take an alternate test as determined by the commander with input from
   health-care personnel.) Once the profile is lifted, the SERE specialist must be given twice
   the time of the profile (but not more than 90 days) to train for the fitness test. For example, if
   the profile period was 7 days, the SERE specialist has 14 days to train for the SPFT after the
   profile period ends. If a normally scheduled SPFT occurs during the profile period, the
   SERE specialist should be given a mandatory make-up date.
   4.4.6. Permanent Profiles. Members who have been given a permanent profile by Air
   Force health professionals will be exempt from the SPFT. In the event that the member is
   returned to duty with no profile, he/she must take the SPFT within 90 days unless otherwise
   indicated in member's profile.
   4.4.7. Alternate Fitness Events:
   4.4.7.1. An alternate aerobic fitness test event is a 6-mile ruck march in lieu of the 2-mile
   run. The 6-mile ruck march will be conducted on flat level terrain with a 40-pound rucksack
   worn for the entire duration of the movement. Successful completion of the 6-mile ruck
   march with 40-pound ruck under the maximum time will be scored at 120 points for the
   aerobic portion of the fitness test.
      4.4.7.2. Additionally, members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim test. The 800-
      meter swim test assesses the aerobic fitness and muscular endurance of the individual.
      Members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim in lieu of the 2-mile run. The
      standards for the alternate swim event are listed in Table 4.2. Satisfactory completion of
      the alternate swim event will be scored at 120 points.

                 SERE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND INSPECTION

5.1. Inspection: MAJCOMs will establish comprehensive certification and evaluation
programs to ensure compliance with this AFI and applicable MAJCOM instructions.
5.2. Compliance with the Air Force SERE Program: This will be assessed in three areas:
formal initial CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support programs. These three areas will be
evaluated during MAJCOM Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), MAJCOM specific
Inspector General inspections, MAJCOM Unit Compliance inspections (UCI), functional
inspections, or site visits.
   5.2.1. Initial SERE Training Programs.
      5.2.1.1. HQ AETC will report all results of ORI evaluations of courses S-V80-A, S-V84-
      A, S-V86-A, S-V87-A, S-V90-A, and MT-220, to HQ USAF/A3OS. These evaluations
      will be conducted at least biennially.
      5.2.1.2. AFSOC/IG will post results of AFSOC ORI evaluations on the AFSOC IG
      website. Evaluations of AFSOC SOF level-B Courses will be conducted in conjunction
      with AFSOC’s regularly scheduled ORI’s.
      5.2.1.3. HQ JPRA, in coordination with HQ USAF/A3OS, will conduct EAI inspections
      of level-B and -C CoCT courses in conjunction with Air Force inspection programs.
          5.2.1.3.1. MAJCOMs will notify HQ USAF/A3OS of pending inspections in which
          JPRA can be integrated for a concurrent EAI inspection.
          5.2.1.3.2. HQ USAF/A3OS will notify JPRA of the pending inspection and
          coordinate JPRA's involvement.
          5.2.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A3OS will obtain the results of evaluations from JPRA.
      5.2.1.3.4. HQ AFMC will report all results of ORI Inspections of USAFSAM Level-B
      Course to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.2. SERE CoCCT Programs.
   5.2.3. SERE MFMs will compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations involving SERE
   CoCCT programs and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.4. SERE Operational Support Programs. MAJCOM SERE functional managers will
   compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations of SERE Operational Support Programs
   and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS by 1 February.
5.3. SERE MFM Responsibilities:
   5.3.1. Coordinate SERE specialists augmentation for inspection teams to evaluate training
   and PR operational support programs.
   5.3.2. As a minimum, all CoCCT programs will be reviewed by a SERE specialist (1T071)
   at least biennially for safety processes and overall program effectiveness. This should be
 40                                              AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013


   incorporated into the normal inspection programs when possible, although staff assistance
   visits are acceptable.
   5.3.3. Ensure PR operational support missions are evaluated by qualified SERE SMEs
   during unit-level Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI)s or equivalent inspections.
5.4. PR Exercises.
   5.4.1. A robust PR exercise program is imperative for preparing the warfighter for
   prosecution of recovery across the spectrum of engagement. A major part of training for the
   PR process is the specific "actions on the objective" or the isolated personnel's role in the
   overall recovery effort. Currently, numerous MAJCOM-directed PR exercises are in place to
   allow recovery forces to execute critical METs of a successful recovery, as well as providing
   potential isolated personnel with an opportunity to practice evasion and recovery skills in a
   simulated combat environment (e.g., Red Flag, Air Mobility Warfare Center CADS, Cope
   Thunder, and ACC/AFSOC Combat Air Force (CAF) integration exercises). These exercises
   provide planners, aviation and ground recovery forces, as well as potential isolated personnel
   a forum for planning and executing full-spectrum PR TTP. Specifically, the SERE role
   within this process is to provide mission-critical feedback and after action review from the
   "survivor's" perspective.
   5.4.2. Specific SERE responsibilities.
      5.4.2.1. Assists in development of exercise plans (EXPLANs), SPINs, PR CONOPs, etc.
      5.4.2.2. Develops mission plans to include survivor participation, aircraft/team support,
      logistical support requirements, etc.
      5.4.2.3. Performs observer/controller (escort) duties to include data collection,
      performance feedback, safety, and emergency field medical treatment, as required.
      5.4.2.4. Coordinates and performs airborne operations, as required.
   5.4.3. Incorporating summary of PR exercise lessons learned and after action into both the
   formal and continuation processes is essential to successful PR. MAJCOMs conducting PR
   exercises will forward sanitized lessons learned and other PR-related after action items to HQ
   USAF/A3OS for review and distribution to the field. Use the "observation, analysis, and
   lessons learned" format for collecting and disseminating data.
      5.4.3.1. HQ AETC/DOFA will ensure applicable data is incorporated into the formal
      training process.
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                             41


     5.4.3.2. MFMs for commands with Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
     personnel and personnel assigned to combat-coded units will ensure appropriate lessons
     learned are distributed to subordinate units for inclusion in continuation/refresher training
     programs.

                      OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

A3.1. The SERE mission area often places personnel in remote environments and potentially
hazardous situations. Conditions often include austere operating locations, inclement weather,
rugged terrain, hazardous life forms, and fixed or rotary-wing operations. While operations
within the SERE mission area are typically objective driven, it is imperative all SERE missions
begin with a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment IAW the six step risk management
processes outlined in AFI 90-201 and AFPAM 90-202. While it is impractical to identify all
potential contingencies during an operation, proper planning will ensure overall individual safety
during high-risk training evolutions. Thorough risk management must assess the risk, weigh all
associated factors, and posture for as many contingencies as possible within a given operation
and ensure the appropriate level of command is involved in the decision making process to
accept residual risk. Regardless of the mission, thorough risk management must include
bioenvironmental, equipment, communication, location, and medical considerations.
   A3.1.1. Specifically, SERE operations and training activities should include the following:
       A3.1.1.1. Bioenvironmental
           A3.1.1.1.1. Weather
           A3.1.1.1.2. Terrain
           A3.1.1.1.3. Animal life
           A3.1.1.1.4. Plant life
           A3.1.1.1.5. Socio-political
   A3.1.2. Equipment
       A3.1.2.1. Vehicles
       A3.1.2.2. Personal protective
   A3.1.3. Communication
       A3.1.3.1. Mobile radios
       A3.1.3.2. Telephone
       A3.1.3.3. Air to ground visual signals
   A3.1.4. Assistance required date and time
       A3.1.4.1. Rear support element
   A3.1.5. Location
   A3.1.6. Medical
       A3.1.6.1. Minor
       A3.1.6.2. Major
       A3.1.6.3. Evacuation plans
 52                                                AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013


       A3.1.6.4. Location/directions/contact procedures for local emergency care facilities.
A3.2. Specifically, the SERE Program approach to ORM should include consideration of three
main areas involved with each factor; "what exists, what is the impact, and what is the plan" for
dealing with each particular factor. Incorporating these areas into unit-level ORM programs will
ensure overall standardization, reduce instability within the planning processes, and ultimately
ensure all SERE operations are prosecuted in a safe manner regardless of the operating
environment.
A3.3. The following ORM checklists/matrixes may be applied to SERE operations and training
activities in order to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission. However, it must be
understood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision-
making procedures: the more complex and potentially hazardous the operation, the more detailed
the mission planning. Additionally, units are encouraged to develop matrixes specifically
tailored to their individual operational requirements.
A3.4. Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in “open water” or when
utilizing compressed air, pose a variety of unique risks that must be accounted for. MAJCOMs
will ensure units develop detailed operating instructions/plans of instruction (OIs/POIs) to ensure
overall objective accomplishment and risk management. Procedures must include location of
decompression chambers and chamber access procedures. The following outlines specific SERE
Specialist/support element requirements when conducting water survival training operations:
   A3.4.1. Certified lifeguard.
       A3.4.1.1. CPR qualified instructors or support personnel.
   A3.4.2. Units are encouraged to conduct training operations in an open water environment.
   Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows:
       A3.4.2.1. All participants will be equipped with adequate flotation.
       A3.4.2.2. Ensure adequate medical coverage is available.
   A3.4.3. Rotary-wing requirements.        In addition to environmental factors, medical
   considerations, recovery TTP, etc. training for rotary-wing crewmembers will also include
   “hands-on” application of the Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) for assigned
   aircrews. Additionally, units are encouraged to utilize the Shallow Water Egress Trainer
   (SWET) as a method of reinforcing “hard skill” requirements associated with underwater
   egress. When conducting hands on HEED and SWET operations, the OIs/POI will also
   include the following additional requirements:
       A3.4.3.1. SERE Specialists conducting HEED training require a thorough understanding
       of dive physiology. Personnel may receive this training either through basic civilian dive
       courses, military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation training.
       A3.4.3.2. To ensure aircrew safety, HEED and/or SWET training must be conducted in a
       controlled environment, i.e., swimming pool. Depth for personnel utilizing the HEED
       apparatus will not exceed 4 feet.
       A3.4.3.3. SWET. As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to clear
       the HEED bottle under water using both approved techniques (IAW US Navy HEED
       video) and breath successfully under water, maintain reference point, release, and
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                        53


       effectively egress the SWET. Participants will be required to demonstrate proficiency
       with the HEED bottle prior to entering the SWET.
A3.5. The matrixes identify basic concepts needed for consideration when conducting water
survival training. These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected
waters.

                             PR KIT/EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE

A4.1. Personnel Recovery Kits (PRK) or equipment, provide High-Risk-of-Capture (HRC)
personnel with essential equipment, tools and items necessary for successful evasion in specific
non-permissive environments. They are designed to supplement/augment AF Issued Survival
vest/kits, which are of a global nature. They should contain items that support the Combatant
Commander's PR plan by including items that aid in evasion and recovery events and enhance
the isolated person's ability to survive and evade. PRKs should be tailored to specific units and
missions when possible.
A4.1. (AMC)The AMC PRK program is an important part of aircrew and High Risk of
Isolation (HRI) personnel preparation against kidnapping, terrorist hostage taking, and
other isolating events. Each wing should have an actively managed PRK program. This is a
joint effort between SERE, Tactics, and Intelligence. PRKs must be issued at home station prior
to deployment, and returned to the same point of issue.
   A4.1.1. Coordinate unit's PRK requirements through the chain of command to respective
   SERE MFMs prior to acquisition. To ensure unity of effort, uniformity, life cycle, and
   supportability of kit items SERE MFMs will coordinate with theater recovery coordination
   centers (i.e., JSRC, RCC, Air Operations Center (AOC), etc.) to ensure interoperability and
   feasibility of PRK items into PR JTTP.
   A4.1.2. SERE SMEs are responsible for recommending items, containers, employment
   methods and conducting necessary PRK training events.
   A4.1.3. HRC personnel should employ PRKs during CST events and PR exercises and
   become familiar with the items. They must possess a thorough understanding of effective
   tactics, techniques and procedures for their employment, zeroization, destruction, and care
   and use while under field conditions.
   A4.1.4. Include PRK items as part of the individuals Evasion Plan of Action. In the event of
   a recovery effort, PRK information for missing personnel must be quickly passed by a secure
   means to the servicing recovery center.
   A4.1.5. PRKs should, as a minimum, contain Evasion Charts (EVC), small nighttime
   signaling devices, Blood Chit, and Pointee-Talkees of the Area of Operations.
   A4.1.6. Additional PRK items should address the specific needs required for successful
   evasion in a specified area of responsibility (AOR) and enhance the isolated person's ability
   to navigate, signal, hide, survive, and facilitate recovery. PRKs can include global
   positioning system (GPS) receivers, infrared lights, camouflage netting, insulated clothing,
   large capacity water containers etc. PRK contents are limited to mission, platform, egress
   procedures, and need.
   A4.1.7. The specific size and placement of the PRK on personnel should be closely
   scrutinized. If worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats, ensure the PRK does
   not impose a windblast hazard. Contact the local wing safety office and the group Life
   Support Officer if there is safety concerns for the PRK. If safety is in doubt, AFMC's Test
AFI16-1301_AMCSUP_I 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                 61


   Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB, CA, and the 311th Human Systems Wing,
   Brooks AFB, TX should evaluate PRKs for impact of emergency egress procedures.
A4.2. (Added-AMC) Coordination and building of PRKs is delegated to the wing SERE
Specialist (if available) who will ensure the kit is built to meet AOR requirements. Include the
kit as a teachable item in the SS-02 CST class.
A4.3. (Added-AMC) Lost PRK wallets must be reported to the blood chit program manager to
deactivate the blood chit number from the program.
A4.4. (Added-AMC) The PRK should satisfy AOR primary and alternate signaling devices
according to current PR SPINS. Such items may include but are not limited to glint tape, IR chem-
light. Light, signal mirror, small IR strobe, laser pointer, blood chit, and pointee-talkee (available
from HQ JPRA at: https://prpublic.jpra.mil/Products_Links/Pages/Pointeeabc.aspx). Do not put
GPSs in PRKs since this will exceed the intended PRK size limitation.
A4.5. (Added-AMC) AMC PRKs should be a small subdued durable kit that is wallet sized
and can be worn around the neck or fit in a pocket of the flight suit or civilian clothes. Kits
should be wallet-sized (about 5x7 inch) with neck strap. Brand-name tags will be removed or
blacked-out. PRK wallets must be individually issued; consolidated bags, backpacks, or
briefcases are not useful. Units will budget for and purchase items necessary to build enough kits
to cover the number of personnel if all their aircraft are deployed at once. The intent is for this
wallet to be individually carried at all times in and out of uniform when operating OCONUS
away from garrison operations.

                   EMERGENCY PARACHUTE TRAINING SAFETY

A5.1. (Added-AMC) Safety must be considered when conducting SS-06 Emergency Parachute
Training, primarily when doing parachute landing falls and “hanging harness”. As a minimum:
   A5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Safety padding at least 4” thick will be placed under EPT/PLD
   training devices while in use. “Landing Mats” commonly used in gymnastics are
   recommended.
   A5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Aircrew members will not be suspended for either EPT or PLD
   training with their feet more than 48” above the floor.
   A5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Aircrew members will wear aircrew helmets, or suitable
   commercial substitute if unavailable, during EPT and PLD training along with other weapons
   system specific aircrew equipment.
   A5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Certified EPT/PLD instructors will visually check to ensure proper
   attachment of PLD equipment prior to disconnecting parachute risers from harness.
   A5.1.5. (Added-AMC) PLFs will be done from a stable platform not to exceed 24” in
   height. Landing area will be a non-hardened surface (example: grass, pea gravel, sawdust or
   padding).
   A5.1.6. (Added-AMC) Instructor will run operational and safety checklist on the EPT
   Trainer (Hanging Harness apparatus) and applicable training aids prior to each EPT class.
   This inspection will include an operational check to ensure the EPT device is working
   properly, as well as a visual inspection of the EPT apparatus to include all attached hardware
   and webbing/risers, training harnesses, PLD device and tape, helmets/visors, masks, and
   LPUs to ensure safety.

          COCCT AUGMENTEE/SUPPORT PERSONNEL TRAINING PLAN

A6.1. (Added) This attachment outlines the AMC SERE training plan used to certify selected
personnel to teach CoCCT where a SERE Specialist does not exist or during the prolonged
absence of an assigned SERE Specialist. All training in this plan will be conducted under the
direct supervision of an assigned AMC SERE Specialist. AMC SERE Specialists will be the only
persons authorized to certify augmentee/ support personnel. All personnel selected to teach SS-
02 CST will be a graduate of SV-80-A, Combat SERE Training. All personnel selected to teach
SS-05 WST will be a graduate of S-V90-A or S-V86-A. Non-SERE personnel will not instruct
SS-03 Conduct After Capture (see para. 2.3.2.3) Some form of Instructor training is highly
encouraged (Aircrew Flight Equipment Instructor course, Academic Instructor School, etc.).
   A6.1.1. (Added) Selected augmentee/ support personnel will be required to observe the
   CoCCT event they intend to teach at least twice before progressing to the next stage of the
   training plan.
   A6.1.2. (Added) Selected augmentee/ support personnel will be required to teach 50% of a
   given event to a satisfactory level before they are permitted to teach the entire event. They
   will then be required to satisfactorily teach 100% of the event, to include setup and teardown.
   A6.1.3. (Added) Selected augmentee/ support personnel will be required to complete this
   training cycle within 4 months of the start date. This training process will be documented on
   a 1098 and in Table A6.1 (below) and kept in the individuals training records. Each person
   certified will be reevaluated on an annual basis by the assigned SERE Specialist to ensure
   proficiency and quality of instruction. To maintain proficiency, each augmentee will
   participate in every event they are certified for, at least once a quarter.
