    in a secure storage area with a valid explosive safety license for the types and quantities
    stored. No explosive safety license is required if less than 1,000 rounds/HC/D 1.4. If an
    organization requires courtesy storage within the MSA, coordinate with the MASO or
    MO as outlined in paragraph 7.

    1.1.7. Commanders may elect to personally receipt for munitions or delegate within their
    authority in Part II and Part III of the AF Form 68.

    1.1.8. Units re-validate the AF Form 68 annually. Any changes in personnel require a
    new AF Form 68.

    *1.1.9. If an organization requires additional custodians be added to the account,
    accomplish a new AF Form 68 or process an addendum AF Form 68. Mark the

       munitions items of suspended or restricted munitions and take appropriate turn-in action.

       1.1.12. Immediately report munitions theft, suspected theft, loss, or destruction
       occurrence to the MASO.

    1.2. The MASO:

       1.2.1. Provides commanders and all custodians a documented “face-to-face” briefing on
       custody account responsibilities and management for new accounts or upon commander
       or custodian change.

       1.2.2. Provides detailed training to organization custodians in property accounting
       management. This training is conducted within 30 calendar days of appointment and is
       documented using the AF Form 68

2. Custody Account Management.

    2.1. Account Establishment:

       2.1.1. An organization establishes a munitions custody account when the organization
       has valid munitions requirements. The commander-appointed account custodian contacts
       their major command functional manager to verify these requirements.

       2.1.2. To establish a custody account, forward a formal request in writing to the MASO
       or MO. MO arranges to provide custodial training session within 30 days of account
       establishment. Munitions assign a custody account number in the Combat Ammunition
       System (CAS) computer system. All munitions processes use this account number for
       tracking and management purposes.

       2.1.3. MO will establish a custody account number when the organization commander
       forwards a completed electronic AF Form 68 for MASO approval. NOTE: Use the
       current version of the AF Form 68 available on the AF E-publishing web site located at:
       http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. If commanders or custodians have questions about
       correctly completing this form, contact the munitions operations personnel or the MASO.
MAXWELLAFBI21-201          14 JUNE 2012                                                      5

     2.1.4. The munitions custodian will ensure their unit custody account jackets have the
     required documentation on file as outlined in Attachment 3 using E-documentation
     procedures.

  2.2. Account Maintenance:

     2.2.1. Custodians use E-document procedures and become familiar with munitions
     electronic document procedures. E-documentation procedures can be located in AFI 21-
     201, parargraph 7.4.4.

     2.2.2. When the MASO or MO determines that an organization is not properly managing
     or maintaining their custody account in accordance with AFI 21-201, the MASO initiates
     the following procedures:

         2.2.2.1. Notifies the organizational commander in writing and allots 15 calendar days
         to correct deficiencies.

         2.2.2.2. If the organization does not correct discrepancies within 15 calendar days
         after notification, the MASO "freezes" the account and no further munitions
         transactions can occur until the custodian corrects the discrepancies.

         2.2.2.3. The MASO “unfreezes” the account when the organization corrects the
         identified discrepancies or may direct the unit to turn-in all assets.

         2.2.2.4. If the organization does not correct the discrepancies within 30 calendar
         days, the MASO notifies the group commander or equivalent for assistance.

  2.3. Inventories:

     2.3.1. All personnel must maintain inventory integrity to prevent ammunition/explosives
     from unauthorized use and theft. Units must account for munitions items until expended,
     turned-in, or disposed of according to this instruction’s guidance.

     2.3.2. Munitions custodians inventory their account to ensure proper asset accountability.
     Custodians can use either CAS AM427G output, MO provided, or manual inventory
     sheets in performing inventories. MO provides the inventory team chief the CAS
     AM427G output. MO freezes the account before the physical count. Upon inventory
     completion, the custodian and inventory team chief sign and date the inventory count
     sheets.

         2.3.2.1. Yearly, the MASO or MO and the account custodian conduct an annual
         MASO custody account inventory. The MASO verifies custodian’s custody account
         management is in accordance with established guidance and procedures.

         *2.3.2.2. DELETED

     2.3.3. The MO team chief updates the account inventory in CAS. Once the inventory
     account is reconciled in CAS, the team chief prints and validates the CAS report,
6                                                   MAXWELLAFBI21-201            14 JUNE 2012

       AM507A, Custody Account Listing. The team chief will annotate the listing with any
       findings and takes the required corrective actions. If discrepancies exist between the
       accountable records and on-hand balances, conduct a thorough investigation in
       accordance with AFI 21-201 and AFI 31-101. The account custodian and the
       organization’s commander sign and date the AM507A and return the completed
       electronic AM507A within 15 calendar days to MO for MASO review and signature.

    2.4. Issue Procedures:

       2.4.1. Organizations submit issue requests to MO using the Maxwell AFB Form 26,
       Munitions Turn-In, Issue Request and Expenditure. Submit these requests no later than 3
       duty days prior to the required issue date.

       *2.4.2. An emergency exists when any unforeseen requirement preventing a unit from
       performing it’s mission and the munitions item requires installation consumption within
       24 hours from the requested date.

       2.4.3. The group commander (or equivalent), or designated representative, must justify
       and approve, in writing, all emergency requests and submit to the MASO for final
       approval.

       2.4.4. Coordinate, through MO, all requests not meeting the requirements of paragraphs
       2.4.1 and 2.4.2.

       2.4.5. See example of a completed Maxwell AFB Form 26 at Attachment 2.

       2.4.6. An authorized representative listed on the requesting organization’s AF Form 68
       must pick up the munitions in a government owned or contractor vehicle from the MSA.
       Strictly adhere to explosive safety procedures outlined in AFMAN 91-201.

       2.4.7. The using munitions custodian completes and signs the AM517, Custody Issue
       Document, before receiving requested munitions.

    2.5. Turn-In Procedures:

       2.5.1. Organizations submit Turn-In requests to MO using the Maxwell AFB Form 26;
       see example at Attachment 2.

       2.5.2. Using organizations return munitions in their original or other suitable container.
       Units must segregate munitions by type and identify by lot number/serial number before
       turn-in.

       2.5.3. Munitions personnel verify the munitions type and quantity turned in. A qualified
       munitions inspector determines actual serviceability, completes the Maxwell AFB Form
       26, Turn-In, Issue, Expenditure form and provides a copy of the request to the account
       custodian.
MAXWELLAFBI21-201           14 JUNE 2012                                                      7

   *2.6. Expenditure Procedures. Organizations submit expenditure requests to MO using
   Maxwell AFB Form 26 (see example at Attachment 2). Submit these requests within 5
   workdays of expenditure.

3. Forecasting Requirements.

   3.1. Forecasting Procedures:

       3.1.1. The annual munitions forecast is the primary means for requesting and allocating
       required training munitions, base mobility and operational requirements. This is the
       single most important report in munitions and completeness, accuracy, and validity are
       necessary.

       *3.1.2. Forecast unit’s requirements to the applicable Munitions User Functional
       Manager (MUFM). Validate requirements using governing Air Force directives and
       approved by the unit’s organizational commander. If requirements change, submit an
       Out-of-Cycle Request (OOCR) (see Attachment 5) in the same manner. MO personnel
       assist but are not responsible for unit forecasts.

       *3.1.3. Forward forecast requirements to MO for Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST)
       validation. MO accomplishes forecast validation each FY as directed by the MAJCOM
       via the FY Peacetime Conventional Ammunition Requirements (PCAR) forecast
       submission.

       3.1.4. Forecast only munitions items with a Master Subsidiary Relationship Code
       (MSRC). DO NOT forecast for Cartridge Actuated Devices (CAD)/Propulsion Actuated
       Devices (PAD) items.

       3.1.5. Make time change forecasts by preparing an AFTO Form 223, Time Change
       Requirements Forecast, as prescribed in Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20-9-WA-1,
       paragraph 4.5. Forward the electronic AFTO Form 223 to MO no later than 7 duty days
       from the “as of date” on the form.

4. Mobility/WRM Munitions Accounting. War Reserve Munitions (WRM) support wartime
activities listed in the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) until the industrial base meets
wartime demand. Munitions custodians account for munitions required for deployments.
Custodians notify the MASO when scheduling munitions for deployment or relocation to another
geographical area.

5. Suspended and Restricted Munitions Procedures.

   5.1. When CMRS notices are received, the MASO ensures that custody account users of
   affected national stock/lot numbers are notified verbally and electronically via e-mail using
   the return receipt option.

   5.2. Upon notification, the affected lot number users take immediate action to screen on-
   hand assets in use and immediately report the restricted/suspended munitions on-hand
8                                                    MAXWELLAFBI21-201             14 JUNE 2012

    quantity to MO. Place particular emphasis on screening munitions installed in aircraft or life
    support equipment.

    5.3. Users with on-hand suspended munitions immediately remove these items from use and
    turn in the property to MO.

6. Security, Handling and Storage of Munitions Procedures.

    *6.1. Munitions and its components are sensitive, hazardous, and highly technical items.
    Each requires a high degree of protection and control. Store munitions in approved storage
    containers and facilities in accordance with AFMAN 91-201 and AFI 21-201. Security
    standards and protection are in accordance with AFI 31-101. Limit munitions handling to
    authorized personnel and maintain constant surveillance during processing.

    6.2. Report any munitions theft, suspected theft, loss or destruction or their components,
    other than fair wear and tear, authorized expenditure, installation or authorized disposal
    action to the MASO and 42d Security Forces. This policy applies to all munitions issued to a
    consumption or custody account, whether in transit or storage.

*7. Courtesy Storage of Munitions. MO may store ammunition and explosives belonging to
an organization in the MSA on a space-available basis when the using organization does not
have approved storage facilities or space. When this situation exists, the requesting organization
submits a Courtesy Storage Agreement (CSA) letter at Attachment 4. The organization’s
commander will sign the CSA and munitions supervision will approve the CSA. The requestor
agrees to the terms set forth in the formal courtesy storage agreement letter with MO.
Organizations accomplish this before storing any assets in the MSA. Although assets are
courtesy stored within the MSA, the users maintain full responsibility for proper asset
accountability and storage.

*8. Disposition of Spent Brass and Cartridges. Custodians/users turn in all casings and fired
brass generated from expenditures for storage at CATM for inspection and disposal. As
authorized by the commander, the CATM will inspect and certify all expended brass casings at
CATM in accordance with T.O. 11A-1-60, General Instructions – Inspection of Reusable
Munitions Containers and Scrap Material Generated from Items Exposed To or Containing
Explosives, and turn items into the servicing Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office
(DRMO). For all other units, MO personnel will receive, inspect and cerify all expended brass
casings, steel and aluminum. Once the inspection and certification are complete, all full
containers with expended casings will be turned into Base Supply for disposition to DRMO.

9. Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Munitions. All COTS munitions require prior approval
as outlined in AFI 21-201, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.24.

10. Management Products. It is the using activity’s responsibility to review all management
products affecting their respective accounts. If using activity detects any errors, deficiencies or
adverse trends, they must notify MO. All commanders and custodians concerned with munitions
consumption or custody accounts must become thoroughly familiar with the following listings:

    10.1. AM507A – Custody Account Listing
MAXWELLAFBI21-201           14 JUNE 2012                                                    9

   10.2. AM535A – DIFM Listing

*11. Documentation Responsibilities. All munitions users have the responsibility to annotate
electronically all documentation affecting munitions as outlined by this instruction. Whenever
MO personnel detect errors or omissions on munitions, documentation MO personnel returns the
document to the respective activity.

12. Munitions After Hours Support. If munitions are required during other than normal duty
hours (0700-1600, Monday through Friday), contact the Command Post at 953-7474.
