        1.4.5.16.1. AFMAO will review OIs annually and revise as necessary.
        1.4.5.16.2. For deaths within the Dover AFB AOR, AFMAO will complete the
        Personal Effects Checklist (Attachment 5).
     1.4.5.17. Assists Air Reserve Component (ARC) full time technician and/or MO in their
     Area of responsibility (AOR) with dispositions of personal property and effects.
  1.4.6. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Special Actions, (DFAS-

     1.4.9. The Force Support Squadron (FSS). Provides copies of the DD Form 1300, Report
     of Casualty, as needed.
1.5. SCO Requirements. The Installation Commander must appoint a SCO when an individual
meets the criteria outlined in sections 1.2.1. to 1.2.5.
1.6. SCO Actions. When an active duty military member dies, the SCO will dispose of
personal property within 45 days. Use Attachment 2, SCO Checklist, to accomplish duties.
EXCEPTION: If a dispute arises over an Air Force determination of the PERE, disposition
may take longer. Shipment of personal property from overseas may be delayed due to customs
and legal requirements of the foreign country involved. All claims for damages to real property
resulting from the death of an active duty member, occurring off installation, are a civil matter.
There is no provision for the Air Force to cover these costs. Due to various causes/manners of
death, the SCO may be questioned as to how the location of death (residence, automobile,
clothing, etc.) is to be cleaned. If the death took place in a residence, refer the lien holder/leaser
to the insurance company which insures the deceased’s residence/property. Another source of
funds may be a security deposit which might settle costs associated with the clean-up. For
deaths occurring in an automobile, the company insuring the vehicle should be consulted as a
possible source to cover associated clean-up or repair cost. If the lien holder/leaser persists,
request their contact information and advise them you will ensure the legal next of kin is
provided their information. Consult with the Mortuary Officer and Staff JA as appropriate for
guidance. This is the extent the SCO/MO is able to assist these parties. Mortuary Funds cannot
be utilized to clean personal clothing items of the deceased. Any clothing items soiled with
blood or bodily fluid should be disposed of as medical waste in accordance with 3.2.4.2. of this
instruction.
AFI34-511 7 JUNE 2011                                                                         9


                                          Chapter 2

 HANDLING AND DISPOSING PERSONAL EFFECTS OF DECEASED PERSONNEL

2.1. This chapter describes the procedures for handling and disposing of the personal
effects of deceased personnel. Chapter 3 describes the procedures for handling and disposing
of personal property.
2.2. Inventorying Personal Effects. The MO will:
   2.2.1. Inventory PE using DD Form 1076.
   2.2.2. List every item with a full description. Annotate “LAST ITEM” below last item and
   draw a line through the rest of the form. Sign and date the form. Attach additional sheets as
   necessary.
   2.2.3. Thoroughly inspect remains to ensure all PE is found. If needed, check pockets of
   clothing to ensure all PE is accounted for.
   2.2.4. Take digital photos of the PE and include as documentation in the case file (Port
   mortuary only).
   2.2.5. The inventory sheet(s) must accompany the personal effects at all times. Keep a copy
   for the case file.
   2.2.6. For deaths under investigation or when circumstances dictate PE cannot be
   inventoried immediately, perform a visual inventory and annotate the inventory sheet.
   Conduct a complete inventory as soon as possible, and make every attempt to ensure PE will
   be returned when available.
2.3. Personal Effects Containing Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment
(OCIE). The SCO:
   2.3.1. Collects all OCIE (i.e., parkas, cold weather footwear) when such items are no longer
   required for investigation, and inventories on DD Form 1076. SCO contacts the deceased
   member's squadron commander to arrange the return of all issued organizational equipment
   and clothing to the squadron.
   2.3.2. Contacts the PERE to determine if they desire any of the remaining organizational
   clothing. NOTE: Dangerous articles and weapons may not be offered to the PERE.
   2.3.3. Includes any organizational clothing, not turned in to the member's squadron,
   requested by the PERE, on DD Form 1076.
   2.3.4. Makes a separate DD Form 1076 for the organizational clothing and equipment to be
   turned into supply.
   2.3.5. Ensures the supply officer signs the DD Form 1076 accepting the items.
   2.3.6. Includes any organizational clothing the PERE desires with the rest of the personal
   property.
2.4. Securing Personal Effects. The MO completes the inventory, cleans the PE, and locks it in
a secure area such as a cabinet, safe, or room. Establishes and maintains a log for deposit and
withdrawal of PE from the secured storage area. Port Mortuary needs a secure storage area to
 10                                                                    AFI34-511 7 JUNE 2011


support PE from a mass fatality incident of 50 or less. Port Mortuary personnel must be able to
control access to the area to ensure PE is safeguarded.
2.5. Disposition of Effects.
   2.5.1. Once the MO has ensured the PERE has been officially notified of the death, the MO
   requests the PERE provide instructions for disposition of the PE. Options include using the
   military escort or mail.
       2.5.1.1. Via Military Escort: The military escort can hand deliver the PE to the receiving
       funeral home or to the PERE. Military escorts will check the inventory sheet(s),
       inventory, and accept responsibility for the personal effects by signing the inventory
       sheet. Two copies of the DD Form 1076 inventory should accompany the PE. Escorts
       will annotate the inventory sheet with the name of the person who accepted responsibility
       for final disposition of the effects and will have that person (funeral director or PERE)
       sign the inventory sheet.
       2.5.1.2. Via US Mail or delivery service: Mail personal effects expeditiously to the
       PERE, base mortuary office, or funeral director. Use a mail or delivery service that has
       tracking capability and require a signature at the receiving destination. Include the
       inventory sheet and an addressed, stamped envelope with the PE and request the
       receiving party sign, date, and return the inventory sheet. Call the recipient prior to
       sending to advise what items are being sent and when they will arrive to ensure receipt
       and reduce any emotional trauma to the family.
   2.5.2. Ensure only the items the PERE requested be shipped with the remains are on the
   remains or in the casket and are visible if the casket is opened.
   2.5.3. Ensure the receiving funeral director is notified if PE is shipped with the remains.
   2.5.4. Ensure the PERE is advised of the nature of the PE on hand before shipping.
2.6. Destroying Personal Effects.
   2.6.1. Mortuary personnel have no authority to arbitrarily destroy personal effects. If the
   remains are being shipped to a port mortuary, all PE should be shipped with the remains and
   the port mortuary personnel should contact AFMAO to obtain instructions from the PERE.
   2.6.2. If the PERE agrees mortuary personnel should destroy some items, record the
   recipients’ instructions in the case file and annotate the items to be destroyed on the DD
   Form 1076.
   2.6.3. On all items to be destroyed, the MO should wait for written authorization by the
   PERE before destroying items. Ensure items are destroyed beyond recognition.
   2.6.4. After destruction, annotate destroyed items on the DD Form 1076.               Place the
   documentation in the case file.
   2.6.5. For additional information regarding destruction of property see paragraph 3.2.4.3
2.7. Record Final Disposition of Personal Effects: Ensure the signed and dated inventory
sheet(s) is included in the case file. If a funeral director or base mortuary personnel accept the
items, verify they will deliver the PE to the PERE and note this on the DD Form 1076.
AFI34-511 7 JUNE 2011                                                                        11


                                          Chapter 3

  DISPOSING OF PROPERTY AND SETTLING ACCOUNTS FOR MEMBERS WHO
                        DIE ON ACTIVE DUTY

3.1. Personal Property Disposition Instructions. The SCO:
   3.1.1. Obtains property disposition instructions and the name and address of PERE from the
   MO, reviews the Training Video, “You Are A Summary Court Officer - What Now?”, and
   establishes a log of events.
   3.1.2. When the SCO and the PERE are in the CONUS, the SCO telephones the PERE and
   introduces him or herself and explains what his or her function is and what he or she will be
   doing. When the death occurs overseas and the PERE is in the CONUS, AFMAO will be the
   point of contact (POC) between the PERE and the MO/SCO in the overseas location.
   AFMAO will determine the PERE and obtain disposition instructions for the property. These
   instructions are provided in a Personal Property Message to the MO/SCO by e-mail. In
   either case, the SCO sends a formal letter of introduction to the PERE within 3 duty days
   after appointment as SCO to advise them of summary court actions. The SCO will also
   explain the need for any additional information necessary to help with disposition; for
   example, power of attorney, if needed. When speaking to the family, all references to the
   deceased should be stated in a personal nature such as “Capt Jones’ wristwatch” and not as
   “the deceased’s wristwatch.” The SCO should coordinate all outgoing correspondence with
   the MO.
   3.1.3. Advises the PERE at least once a week about progress in resolving property matters.
   Annotate all correspondence in the log of events.
   3.1.4. Informs the MO and Technician of all correspondence with the PERE, other agencies,
   and interested parties.
   3.1.5. Places a minimum of two announcements of death in the base newspaper asking
   anyone with a claim for or against the estate to step forward.
   3.1.5.1. If there is a charge to publish the announcements of death, this expense must be
   paid using O&M Funds.
   3.1.6. Sends the local defense accounting officer completed copies of DD Form 139, Pay
   Adjustment and Authorization, with bills for the member’s debts to the US Government
   within 2 weeks of the date of death.
   3.1.7. Completes and signs a DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, if the
   deceased member was on temporary duty (TDY) or en route to a PCS, submits the voucher
   with the member’s orders (refer to DFAS-DEM 177-373, Volume 1, Joint Uniform Pay
   System).
3.2. Inventorying Property. The SCO:
   3.2.1. Inventories all property on DD Form 1076.
12                                                                   AFI34-511 7 JUNE 2011


  3.2.2. Promptly gathers the uniform and clothes needed for burial and gives to MO, when
  requested by the PADD. Consideration should be given to providing a new uniform to allow
  the Airman’s uniform to be retained by the family for sentimental purposes.
  3.2.3. Collects organizational clothing and equipment. Turns in organizational clothing and
  equipment to the responsible supply officer (see paragraph 2.3 for organizational clothing
  that may be offered to the authorized recipient).
  3.2.4. Removes any questionable items and determines the disposition of this property based
  on the following criteria:
     3.2.4.1. Categories of Questionable Property. Questionable property falls into one of
     three categories: Category 1 - Property with no intrinsic or sentimental value which
     includes, but is not limited to, items which have no salable value (for example, used
     toothpaste, soap, deodorant, lotions, shampoo, tobacco, magazines, candy, opened food
     items) or items which could damage other property such as liquid shoe dye, corrosives,
     flammables, or oils. Category 2 - Obnoxious or embarrassing property which includes,
     but is not limited to, items which are mutilated, burned, bloodstained, damaged beyond
     repair, obscene, or unsanitary. Category 3 - Inflammatory property which includes, but
     is not limited to, items which could cause further grief to the next of kin such as
     compromising pictures, videos, personal letters, clothing items soiled with blood or
     bodily fluid or other items which directly involve the decedent.
     3.2.4.2. Criteria for Disposition of Questionable Property in Categories 1 and 2.
     Property items determined to be in Category 1 (no intrinsic or sentimental value) or
     Category 2 (obnoxious or may be embarrassing to the recipient) may only be destroyed
     with written confirmation by the authorized recipient. The SCO has no authority to
     arbitrarily destroy personal property in these two categories. When possible, soiled,
     bloodstained, or torn clothing should be made presentable by the SCO/MO using FSS O
     & M Funds to cover cleaning expenses through commercial vendors. However, the
     PERE should be asked if they would like to have the items, and if so, state the condition
     of the items and that they will be cleaned before return. Opened mail, papers,
     photographs, videotapes, books, magazines, and other such items will be screened for
     suitability. The SCO should pay close attention to cell phones, iPods, digital cameras,
     and computers to ensure these and like devices do not contain inflammatory items. If so,
     all efforts should be made to ensure this data is removed and transferred from the device
     to a storage medium for retention until a decision on destruction is made. Exposed, but
     unprocessed film will be processed using FSS O&M Funds and screened for suitability.
     The MO will ensure FSS funds are available to the SCO to cover these expenses.
     3.2.4.3. Criteria for Disposition of Questionable Property - Category 3. The possession
     of and decision to destroy inflammatory items will not involve the PERE. These items
     will be annotated on a separate DD Form 1076 and turned over to the MO. The MO will
     retain the questionable property for a minimum of 45 days following receipt of the
     property by the PERE, in the event the PERE requests information pertaining to these
     items. Once 45 days have passed, and the PERE has made no inquiry regarding the
     questionable property, the MO should then ensure the questionable property is destroyed.
     All destruction of personal property must be coordinated with the installation legal office.
AFI34-511 7 JUNE 2011                                                                             13


       3.2.4.4. Items prohibited for shipment will be disposed of according to existing
       directives; however, privately owned firearms and ammunition may be shipped to the
       PERE in accordance with TMO policies and provided they meet Customs entry
       requirements.
   3.2.5. The SCO will provide a list, of all items withdrawn and disposed of to the MO for
   inclusion in the official SCO File.
   3.2.6. Methods of destruction. The SCO, in coordination with the MO, may destroy and
   dispose of inappropriate items by incineration, shredding, or mangling. In determining
   which method to use, consideration must be given to the possibility of other persons
   recovering the items designated for destruction. Destruction must be absolute, obliterating
   all evidence of the prior owner’s and other related person’s identity, and rendering the item
   useless and without any value.
3.3. Disposing of Identification (ID) and Military Documents. The SCO:
NOTE: Military ID cards/CAC Cards, Military Driver’s Licenses, and other documents the
deceased member may have carried are extremely powerful mementos for surviving family
members and every attempt should be made to return these items to the families. SCOs may
work with the Military Personnel Section (MPS), transportation, and other offices to clear these
accounts and then return the cards to family members. Refer to AFI 36-3026, Issuing and
Controlling ID Cards. Items such as line badges and cards for entry to controlled or classified
areas should be disposed of IAW current directives.
   3.3.1. Gives ID tags to the MO to place with the body. EXCEPTION: If the body has
   already been shipped, send the ID tags to the PERE.
   3.3.2. Gives the DD Form 2293, US Government Motor Vehicle Operator’s ID Card, to the
   PERE after clearing with transportation.
   3.3.3. Clears DD Form 2, Armed Forces ID Card, DoDCIO/OUSD (P&R), United States
   DoD/Uniform Service Identification Card (CAC), with the personnel records custodian and
   then provides it to the PERE.
   3.3.4. Safeguards military documents and submits any classified documents to the proper
   authorities for disposition.
3.4. Disposing of Mail and Personal Papers. The SCO:
   3.4.1. Marks mail received for the member after death with the word, “DECEASED”,
   endorses it, takes it to the servicing post office for return to sender, and keeps a record of the
   items returned.
   3.4.2. Forwards all personal papers promptly by registered mail to the PERE and keeps a
   record of the forwarded items (refer to Attachment 1 for a definition of personal papers).
3.5. Disposing of Funds and Negotiable Instruments. The SCO may:

   collected money for debts owed to the member. Get a receipt for payment and record all
   cash transactions on DD Form 1076.
   3.5.3. Give unused cash to the PERE, if that person lives in the local area. If the PERE lives

   NOTE: If the currency exceeds the amount authorized in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 5, DoD
   Financial Management Regulation, give an application to the installation commander to
   certify Air Force personnel acquired the currency properly. Include souvenir currency with
   the deceased member’s personal property (refer to Attachment 1 for a definition of souvenir
   currency).
3.6. Shipping Items. The SCO coordinates with the Transportation Officer to arrange shipment
of household goods. PCS funds are used to move personal property of deceased active duty
personnel. PCS funding classifications for officers and enlisted members are annotated on DD
Form 1300.
3.7. Shipping Other Items. The SCO:
   3.7.1. May ship one vehicle owned by the member or member’s legal dependent if it is in
   good operating condition (refer to definition in Attachment 1 for a privately owned vehicle).
