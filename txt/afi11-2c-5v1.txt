          management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
          programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
          current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
          upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
          level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but
          are not limited to crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training
          (i.e., crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training
          (including performance during training and current certification status), future
          training (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current
          waivers, projected waivers, and continuation training status.
      1.4.6.4. Review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or attached
      crewmembers and those completing formal training to determine the necessary training
      required to complete/certify the individual as Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic
      Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR).
      1.4.6.5. Coordinate with the operations group in developing training programs.

  NOTE: For formal training waiver requests (except those included in paragraphs 1.5.3 and
  1.5.4.1), units will submit requests through above MAJCOM channels. MAJCOMs will in
  turn submit requests to AFRC/A3T for approval.

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DOD) Regulation 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202v1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or
       off-station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2C-5v3, C-5 Operations Procedures, for off-station training flight
       requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification, or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 TACC and tasked units will jointly identify and take maximum
   advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation training items which may be
   conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. If necessary 618 TACC and
   tasked-units will coordinate training mission numbers for the specific mission segment.
   Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and that the
   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2C-5v3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2.
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification, requalification, or
certification will be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis.
   1.7.1. Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly
   contributing to qualification, certification, or upgrade), e.g., CBT lesson, Part Task Trainer
   (PTT), or Weapon System Trainer (WST), ground training, flight, etc.; or 45-days (90-days
   ARC) after being attached or assigned to the unit after completion of the FTU course,
   whichever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). Training time ends with
 16                                                             AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


   the successful completion of one of the following events: flight evaluation (if required as part
   of the training program), instructor validation of successful program completion (―sign-off‖),
   or squadron commander certification (if required as part of the training program).
   Crewmembers should begin their checkrides within 30 days of syllabus completion.

NOTES:
1. 180 days for loadmasters (240 days for ARC), and 30 days for 2nd FEs.
2. 360 days for First FE (720 days for ARC). Training blocks have additional limitations:
- Block 1 (Msn Cert): 30 days. Sq/CC may authorize a 15-day extension. An extension in
excess of 15 days requires OG/CC approval.
- Block 2: 90 days (180 days for ARC). Sq/CC may authorize a 30-day extension. An
extension in excess of 30 days requires OG/CC approval.
- Block 3: 110 days (220 days for ARC). Sq/CC may authorize a 30-day extension. An
extension in excess of 30 days requires OG/CC approval.
- Block 4: 60 days (120 days for ARC). Sq/CC may authorize a 15-day extension. An
extension in excess of 15 days requires OG/CC approval.
- All Blocks: OG/CC extensions will be the same as the Sq/CC extension limits. An extension
in excess of OG/CC waiver requires MAJCOM (or equivalent) approval.



   1.7.2. Loadmaster Initial Qual (LMIQ) graduates awaiting the First Term Airman‘s Center
   (FTAC) course may accomplish ground training, phase training, and local orientation flights
   to maintain knowledge and skills learned during initial qualification training. If mission
   qualification training is started prior to FTAC, the 180/240-day time period begins upon
   completion of FTAC. Document the FTAC course dates in the individual‘s training folder.
   1.7.3. Sq/CC may extend training time up to 60 days (120 days ARC). No notification to
   MAJCOM/A3T is required. Extensions exceeding 60-days (120 days ARC) require
   MAJCOM/A3T approval. Units will notify the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
   via the waiver request procedures specified in paragraph 1.5.8., before the crewmember
   exceeds upgrade training time limits.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                   17


1.8. Training Documentation. C-5 units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft
Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS. Block
22 will be used to document award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers contain the following
minimum information: ―Q‖ code (i.e., QXXX), Certification Name (i.e., Phoenix Banner), and
date of certification. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. See Attachment 2 for additional
training documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. Units may use flight evaluators as instructors for
qualification, local upgrade, or corrective-action training. If an evaluator is the primary
instructor to train an individual, the same evaluator should not administer the associated
evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing-level and below). Instructors must be current and
   qualified in any event that they instruct. Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructors are only
   required to maintain BMC.
   1.10.2. The following personnel will be under direct supervision of an instructor of like
   specialty:
       1.10.2.1. All noncurrent aircrew members. (See paragraph 4.9 for exceptions)
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or re-qualification flying training unless
       syllabus states direct supervision is not required.
       1.10.2.3. All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8
       as prescribed by AFI 11-202v2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
       Organization and Administration.
       1.10.2.4. Unqualified, FTL E, or AMC staff crew members on indoctrination flight
       orders.
       1.10.2.5. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
   1.10.3. For unqualified and Flying Training Level (FTL) E pilots, an instructor must be at a
   set of controls during critical phases of flight.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements for this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. Before a crewmember will interfly from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review and assess their qualification and currency. See also AFI 11-401.
   1.12.1. A crewmember qualified in the same Mission-Design Series (MDS) (C-5A/B/C)
   according to AFI 11-202v2 will be considered qualified in that equipment throughout the C-5
   force. For inter-command transfers and exchange officers, instructor qualifications may be
   accepted at the discretion of the gaining unit commander. Certified/qualified MR
   crewmembers transferring between units accomplish only unit specific training and any
   applicable events in which they have lost currency. See AFI 11-2C-5v3, Interfly, for
   additional information.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
flying‖ (DNIF) may complete ground training events or simulator training, if the member's
 18                                                             AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


physical condition allows it. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042 action
(prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes
ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AFRC/A3T in coordination with AMC/A3T
   manages the training command‘s role in the AF/A3O-AT Flying Training CONOPS. A key
   product of this process is the PFT. The PFT balances available training quotas, FTU
   capacity, and course requirements on a fiscal year basis. Annually, units will send projected
   PFT requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff which will forward projections
   to AFRC/A3T.
       1.14.1.1. AF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference to balance pipeline production
       requirements and MAJCOM training requests against FTU capacity. AFRC/A3T in
       coordination with AMC/A3T allocates quotas to lead and user commands who, in turn,
       allocate training quotas to each unit.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staffs and PFT managers use
       assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers to one of the C-5
       formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on quota
       management documents. 733 TRS will publish the quota management documents on the
       733           TRS            Community             of         Practice         (CoP):
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=RC-OP-03-03.
1.15. Information Management. AMC Aircrew Training Division ( AMC/A3T) hosts
crewmember training information on AMC/A3T CoP. ANG hosts crewmember training
information on web site: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/NGB-A3O. The Lackland FTU hosts FTU
training information on 733 TRS CoP.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a Progress Review
(PR) according to the Commander‘s Review Process outlined in the course syllabus. The PR can
recommend continuation in training or AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action, e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB). The formal
school will notify the gaining unit of any AFI 11-402 action taken. If a crewmember fails to
complete a formal upgrade course, the FTU will send a recommendation to the individual‘s unit
stating whether he or she should complete training in-unit, return to the formal school to
complete training, or be referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment. The ATS
contractor will identify students who fail to progress according to the ATS contract (see Chapter
6).
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA). CEA qualifications are not restricted to AFI 36-2101,
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), skill level upgrades. All enlisted aircrew
qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When an AF Form 8 is
completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform all
duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight
examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from On-the-Job Training (OJT) trainer or
certifier designation and are reflected in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by use of ―K‖ prefix
(aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew flight examiner) identifiers.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     19


1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC‘s
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program Training Management; 36-2107, and AFI 11-412,
Aircrew Management. This policy is mandatory for all AMC C-5 units. All other units follow
MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) guidance.
   1.18.1. Training allocations requirements will be submitted to the appropriate FTU quota
   manager no later than (NLT) 30 Sep for the following fiscal year. MAJCOM/A3T will
   consolidate and crosscheck requests with the Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS).
   The results are internally coordinated and submitted to AFRC and Air Staff during the annual
   GPRD data call and the annual PFT conference.
   1.18.2. MAJCOM/A3T will breakout the command quota allocations from the approved
   PFT according to requirements, requested number, PAMS data, training review panel (TRP)
   submissions, and overall allocation. The initial draft will be sent to the Operations Support
   Squadron (OSS) training offices in June/July with a one-week coordination and review
   period. The final version will be released NLT 31 July. Changes past this point are
   coordinated on a case-by-case basis.
   1.18.3. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSN, course, and class number
   to 733 TRS NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any internal
   processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior to CSD
   will be offered to the next unit on the 733 TRS standby list. OSS training offices should
   reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to ensure
   notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders issued.
   Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
   733TRS.quotamanagement@us.af.mil.              Note: SSN use reduction must be considered to
   safeguard personally identifiable information (PII). For details see DTM 07-015, DoD SSN
   Reduction              Plan            at          the           following            website:
   (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/pr080328ssn.pdf). Follow DTM guidance
   until the DoD Instruction is published (same subject), and AFI 33-332, AF Privacy Act
   Program, can be updated.
      1.18.3.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow
      for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate
      for each allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 – 45 days
      prior to CSD, notify 733 TRS with the alternate‘s information.
      1.18.3.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted; they must also be
      identified when submitted to load against an allocation. Send the replacement‘s full data
      to AMC/A3TF.
   1.18.4. Submit requests for local upgrades (include use of academic only quotas) to
   MAJCOM/A3T.
      1.18.4.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
      name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
      Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
      normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
      and AF Form 63 is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal

     Training office for additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically
     generate ADSC requirements.
  1.18.5. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify 733
  TRS so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified candidate from
  attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training, etc), inform 733
  TRS immediately. Return all unused quotas to 733 TRS NLT 45 days prior to CSD.
  1.18.6. All cancellations within 7 days of CSD and no-shows must be explained. Forward
  an initial report of circumstances to 733 TRS quota management office within 24 hours of
  CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation from the
  OG/CC to AFRC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AFRC.DOT@us.af.mil and courtesy copy 733TRS.quotamanagement@us.af.mil.
  1.18.7. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be
  given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC
  crews established in AFI 11-2C-5v1. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing per
  class without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30
  days prior to CSD. AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to CSD for units
  to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will be available
  14 days prior to CSD, and units will be notified via email. AMC/A3TF will no longer
  accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to
  CSD to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit. Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling
  can be referred to AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.
  1.18.8. 733 TRS will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to 733 TRS for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
  jeopardy, AFRC/A3T will coordinate with Air Staff and AFRC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. MAJCOM/A3T quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training
  offices exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office.
  This policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in-synch with
  each other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the
  primary and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.
  1.18.9. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
  OSS/OST training offices will forward all requests to the AFRC quota manager for
  coordination with other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when
  considering this option.
  1.18.10. Senior Officer Training coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
  AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management
  office, AMC/A3TF, and AFRC/A3T. Questions regarding the Senior Officer training
  course, availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to AFRC/A3T at DSN 497-1126. No
  formal actions to schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or AF/DPG in
  conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202v1, defines initial qualification training. This chapter
specifies minimum training requirements for initial qualification, requalification,
conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses. The primary method of aircrew
qualification is to complete the appropriate formal training course described in the ETCA. When
quotas are not available, units will request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification training using
appropriate formal school courseware.
2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites
in accordance with AFI 11-202v1, the ETCA web site, this publication, and the course syllabus.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete syllabus and ancillary ground training
requirements for initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202v1.
   2.3.1. Initial Qualification Ground Training Events. Students entered into formal
   undergraduate and graduate training programs leading to aircrew qualification should
   accomplish the events listed in Table 2.1 These events will be accomplished during
   Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), Basic Training, Aircrew Fundamentals Course (AFC),
   Basic Loadmaster School (BLM), Basic Flight Engineer Course (BFE), survival training, and
   C-5 initial qualification courses. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation
   indicating completion of items in Table 2.1 The FTU will document events not accomplished
   during formal school training in the individuals training record prior to graduation from the
   C-5 initial qualification course. Gaining units will ensure all initial qualification events are
   completed prior to completing mission certification. If in-unit initial or re-qualification
   training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, the unit is responsible for
   ensuring all requirements are completed.
        2.3.1.1. Ground and flying training events accomplished during formal training will use
        the course completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all
        subsequent currency and requirements. Completion of Initial SERE Schools according to
        AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial
        Aircrew Flight Equipment training (during formal school) will establish the follow-on
        due dates of training (based on the date first completing the course) for recurring training
        requirements.

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished.
2. Not required for basic aircraft qualification crewmembers or Senior Officers.
3. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember‘s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no need to assign and track these
training events in the training module of ARMS.

2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with the FTU syllabus, AFI 11-202v1 and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion/Difference Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
personnel in other units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances it will be necessary for
units to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                        23


requirements may be waived. The following conditions will apply to management of initial
cadre aircrew qualification:
   2.5.1. MAJCOM, in-coordination with lead and training commands, will develop a training
   plan for unit conversions. The plan should include provisions to form a nucleus of
   crewmembers to include instructors and flight examiners (initial cadre). Converting units
   may request initial cadre waiver of PAI time requirement. Send waiver requests through
   MAJCOM training staff in the format in paragraph 1.5 In the request, include the most
   recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section of the waiver.
   2.5.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held, e.g.,
   C-5 mission pilot (MP) to C-17 evaluator pilot (EP), unless previously qualified in the
   conversion aircraft.
   2.5.3. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and
   flight examiners by crew qualification.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. Aircrew members will attend a formal initial qualification course
for dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualifications in
different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL ―A‖ currency requirements in each
aircraft (N/A for senior officers). The approval authority for dual-qualification is the AMC/A3 or
MAJCOM equivalent.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 identifies senior officer
qualification requirements. The Senior Officer Course (SOC) is available on ETCA. See
paragraph 1.5.6 for SOC waiver authority.
   2.7.1. Senior officer qualification is reserved for rated officer positions requiring operational
   flying. This includes O-6 selects and above, and in some cases, O-5s permanently filling an
   O-6 position. Unless specifically requested, justified and validated (by MAJCOM/A3),
   senior officers will attend the SOC. The SOC does not lead to unsupervised qualification;
   these senior officers will fly with an instructor and maintain FTL E continuation training
   requirements. Senior officers who maintain FTL E should maintain Basic Aircraft
   Qualification (BAQ) requirements (see paragraph 4.3.1.5). Exception: Senior officers with a
   requirement to fly unsupervised (limited to wing/group commanders and their deputies) must
   complete the appropriate Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) or Pilot
   Requalification (PREQ) course
   2.7.2. Mission ready senior officers flying unsupervised will be current and qualified and
   should maintain FTL A continuation training requirements.
   2.7.3. Senior officer training, qualification, and certification should occur within the first 180
   days after assuming the assignment.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are authorized to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and
log time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph
3.5 for training requirements.
2.9. Requalification Training. AFI 11-202v1 specifies requalification training limits and
requirements (see Attachment 3). See Chapter 6 for formal Aircrew Training System courses.
Requalification training is an in-unit course, but may be conducted at the FTU. Unless specified
otherwise in AFI 11-202v1, a crewmember is unqualified upon expiration of the qualification
 24                                                             AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter 4), or
completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (Exception: When authorized
multiple qualifications). See paragraph 6.7.9 for a description of and prerequisites for the pilot
requalification course.
   2.9.1. The AFI 11-202v1 requalification training limits and requirements also apply to loss
   of mission qualification or certification as specified in paragraph 4.9
   2.9.2. The Sq/CC will determine if training is required to regain certification. The Sq/CC
   should consider items to include the amount of time since expiration of aircraft qualification,
   crewmember's experience level, and any changes to the event when determining what, if any,
   training is required. If training is required, options could range from only ground training to
   the full syllabus for the certification.
   2.9.3. Flight engineers and loadmasters unqualified in the C-5 over 8 years will complete C-
   5 initial qualification courses at the appropriate C-5 FTU. All other unqualified flight
   engineers and loadmasters will complete Sq/CC-directed requalification training and a flight
   evaluation.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                    25


                                           Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. All crewmembers will complete initial
qualification followed by mission certification training (MCT). Except where specifically stated,
units conducting MCT may arrange mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to
use flying training hours to effectively accomplish the unit mission. Crewmembers will be MR
before entry in special mission qualification, certification, or upgrade training. Crewmembers in
MCT may participate in exercises (see paragraph 1.6.2).
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See Table 1.2 During this period
crewmembers will complete remaining requirements from Table 2.1, the ground training
requirements in Table 3.1 and flying training requirements described in paragraph 3.4 Upon
successful completion, and approval by the Sq/CC, Mission Ready (MR) status may be awarded.
   3.2.1. Upon completion of all MCT requirements, ACIQ and PREQ graduates will be
   counted as MR pilots for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as an FPL on any crew,
   including operational missions. ACIQ and PREQ graduates are not MPs and may not fly as
   pilot-in-command until formally certified by the Sq/CC.
   3.2.2. ARMS Tracking. Upon graduation from formal training, Pilot Initial Qualification
   (PIQ) and ACIQ graduates will be coded ―FP‖ with a suffix for ARMS tracking. Units will
   count these graduates as pilots. Once pilots certify as aircraft commanders, units will code
   them as ―MP‖ and log the certification date in ARMS. See Table 5.2 for pilot designation
   codes. Active duty loadmaster initial qualification graduates will be coded ―FL‖ for ARMS
   tracking and SORTS reporting purposes until mission ready (This does not affect the ―ML‖
   qualification listed on the AF Form 8).
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish events in Tables 2.1
and 3.1, before mission ready certification. Training may be accomplished concurrently with
other training.
   3.3.1. Local training and CONUS missions may be flown before completing all events,
   provided flight physical, physiological training, G002, LL01, LL03, and SS01 are
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If required, complete proficiency (P) events not accomplished at FTU before declaring
   MR.
   3.3.3. Certified or qualified MR crewmembers transferring between units will require only
   Aircraft Ground Marshaling Training and Examination (G002), ISOPREP Review (G120),
   Local Area Survival (SS01), and unit-specific MR training events (and events in which they
   may have lost currency during the change-of-station).
   3.3.4. Ground training events accomplished during MCT establish the crewmember's due
   dates for subsequent continuation training. Completion of initial combat survival training -
   S-V80-A, initial water survival training - S-V90-A, and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment
   training (during FTU) will establish the due dates (based on date first completing the course)
   for recurring SS02, SS03, SS05, SS06, G100 and E114 requirements.

   3.3.5. Upon completion of all requirements of Table 3.1 and applicable flying requirements
   of paragraph 3.4, an AC Initial Qualification (ACIQ) graduate will be counted as a MR pilot
   (FPQ) for SORTS and TRP purposes.

NOTES:
1. Not required for basic aircraft qualification or basic mission capable crewmembers.
2. Re-accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station.
3. Will be accomplished before the first flight.
3.4. Flying Training Requirements:
   3.4.1. BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level and
   accomplish continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4. Continuation training
   requirements will be prorated based on the training time start date as defined in paragraph
   1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during MCT IAW paragraph 4.4.1.
   Crewmembers pursuing MR status who fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements
   (currency and semi-annual) must fly in a supervised status when that event is required for a
   particular flight.
        3.4.1.1. Crewmembers in MCT who fail to accomplish all semi-annual training
        requirements must complete training IAW paragraph 4.9.3 prior to awarding MR status.
        On a case-by-case basis, the Sq/CC may review the crewmember's training accomplished
        and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in the
        crewmember‘s training folder.) Crewmembers non-current for an event may be certified
        MR on a case-by-case basis, but the crewmember will remain NMR for that event and
        will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW paragraph 4.9.1.1.
   3.4.2. After arrival at duty station, all crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and a
   local orientation/mission ready (MR) flight. For pilots, the MR flight may be substituted by
   a simulator sortie focused on events specific to the unit‘s mission. If a simulator is used for
   the MR sortie, the local orientation briefing flight remains a separate requirement (not
   applicable for in-unit, re-qualification or upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and
   local flight does not preclude the crewmember from flying as MR.
   3.4.3. Familiarization Flight. Prior to mission certification, pilots will receive a duty
   familiarization flight. At the discretion of the Sq/CC, pilots qualified in one AMC aircraft
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     27


   who subsequently qualify in the C-5 or previously qualified AMC ACs (performing
   essentially the same mission) may be certified without a familiarization flight. C-5 pilots
   will observe this mission from the jumpseat. Familiarization pilots may occupy the right seat
   during the cruise portion of mission provided a qualified pilot or higher occupies the jump
   seat or the left seat. At the aircraft commander‘s discretion, the familiarization pilot may
   occupy the right seat for takeoffs and landings after observing two overseas sorties. A
   familiarization flight for pilots will include:
       3.4.3.1. Participation in a unit mission (actual or training). The mission should be
       conducted overseas and transit one of the unit's representative routes.
       3.4.3.2. Flight planning to include consideration of terrain and obstacles.
       3.4.3.3. Forms completion and review.
       3.4.3.4. Demonstration of communications and IFF/SIF equipment and procedures.
       3.4.3.5. En route programming and operation of the FMS.
3.5. Flight Surgeon Mission Qualification Requirements. Before deploying or acting as
aircrew in any aircraft other than their primary, flight surgeons must fly at least two sorties in
their primary aircraft, complete all required ground training events listed in Table 4.3 (for the
primary aircraft), and accomplish flight surgeon testing on the AFDL website.

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure crewmembers receive
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. C-5 crewmembers are assigned MR, NMR, BMC, or BAQ status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For (SORTS) reporting, operational tasking, and deployments,
   an MR aircrew member is defined as one who is current, available (as defined in AFI 10-201,
   paragraph 3.2), qualified, and certified in the squadron's mission (completed mission
   qualification training for applicable crew position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember who is unqualified, noncurrent or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   required continuation training.
      4.2.2.1. ACIQ graduates, upon completion of all ground and flying training requirements
      in Chapter 3, will be designated and serve as pilots until completion of operational
      mission certification. These individuals will accomplish aircraft commander continuation
      training requirements.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). An NMR crewmember assigned to MAJCOM
   headquarters, NAF, EMTF, 618 TACC, USAF EC, a Contingency Response Group (CRG),
   Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG), the FTU, or a direct reporting unit who has
   satisfactorily completed mission qualification training and does not maintain MR status, but
   maintains familiarization in the command or unit operational mission.
      4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission
      and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.
      4.2.3.2. Formal Schoolhouse (FTU) BMC crewmembers are certified to conduct all
      aspects of the training mission. FTU instructors must be certified in the training/unit
      mission before performing instructor duties. FTU crewmembers may fly CONUS
      (includes Alaska and Hawaii) and Caribbean missions, but will comply with MR
      requirements to fly all other missions.
      4.2.3.3. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
      mission for which they are current and qualified.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
   completed initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit
   aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements in AFI 11-202v1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the
   ground and flying training continuation tables.
4.3. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     29


   4.3.1. The Sq/CC determines the FTL before the start of each semi-annual period. The
   Sq/CC will assign new unit crewmembers a FTL during their in-processing and base that
   FTL on experience and aircraft proficiency
       4.3.1.1. FTL A--Highly experienced crewmembers (As a guide, crewmembers having 10
       or more years of operational flying experience). This may include MR or NMR AMC
       headquarters and 618 TACC personnel, NAF personnel, USAF EC instructors, wing, OG,
       and squadron commanders, operations officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation
       positions, and any instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Sq/CC may assign
       highly experienced MR line crewmembers to this level. Note: NMR crewmembers
       assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, EMTF, TACC, USAFEC, CRGs, or a direct
       reporting unit are categorized as BMC and assigned to FTL A. If these individuals
       accomplish annual CRM training requirements, they may fly unsupervised on CONUS
       training missions provided they are current and qualified. They require instructor
       supervision on all other missions. Since these crewmembers do not maintain MR status,
       they cannot log MP, MF, or ML time. If refresher simulator training requirements are not
       met, the individual must fly with an instructor of like specialty unless waived (see
       paragraph 4.9).
       4.3.1.2. FTL B--Experienced, mission ready crewmembers (As a guide, crewmembers
       having between 5 and 10 years of operational flying experience).
       4.3.1.3. FTL C--Crewmember (As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of
       operational flying experience). Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers and
       individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification training to FTL C. This training
       level may also be assigned to flight test and other staff crew members.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D—Not Used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E--Basic Aircraft Qualification, non-instructor staff. May include senior
       officers, MAJCOM, NAF, and 618 TACC individuals that are not maintaining MR or
       instructor status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status. Crewmembers
       assigned to FTL E will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. (Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
   change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade). Place BAQ crewmembers into a different
   FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are located in Chapter 7. Unit defined events will be designated ―X‖ events (e.g., X020). Units
will include a description in their local training procedures.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Crewmembers may credit events accomplished
   during training, operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency
   requirements and establish a subsequent due date. They must be qualified in the events and
   either current or under the supervision of an instructor. Use date of evaluation as the date of
   accomplishment for all flying training currency events that were trained during the formal
   course. Continuation training events accomplished during upgrade training prior to the
   evaluation are credited towards the requirements for the current crew position. Do not log
   training events for the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation.

   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training requirements
   for those events graded Q-3 until requalified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating. Exception:
   Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or air refueling
   flown by another pilot.
   4.4.5. Documenting Aircrew Training.
      4.4.5.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
      4.4.5.2. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
      consolidated under one ARMS entry.
      4.4.5.3. Combined training events may be submitted via a single ARMS entry.
      4.4.5.4. Input all one-time events and events required for permanent change-of-station
      (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units may continue to display one-time events on the
      crewmember‘s currency report.
4.5. Continuation Training Events.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual
   crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to
   ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Tables 4.1
   and 4.2 as applicable.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Tables 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status.
      See paragraph 4.9 for exceptions and regaining mission ready status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status, but may restrict member from certain missions requiring the
      associated training. Staff crewmembers (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF EC,
      etc.) may accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of
      attachment. The crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events
      to their unit of attachment (ARMS office).
      4.5.2.3. Attached crewmembers, i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAF EC, etc., may accomplish
      ground training events at locations other than their units of attachment. Individuals are
      responsible for reporting accomplished training to their unit of attachment (ARMS
      office).
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72 hours) may
      accomplish ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission
      accomplishment. Specify requirements and or restrictions in the MAJCOM supplement
      or local training procedures.
      4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons comply with requirements of Table 4.3.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                      31


        4.5.2.6. Ground training requirements are not required for those aircrew members who
        will not remain in the command or will be assigned non-flying positions within 4 months
        after their due date.

     4.5.3.4. Senior officers and staff crewmembers maintaining basic aircraft qualification
     will, as a minimum, maintain FTL E requirements. This requirement also applies to
     additional aircraft in which an individual is qualified.
     4.5.3.5. Overseas Sortie. OG/CC may substitute CONUS operational sorties for
     overseas when airlift requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for overseas
     sortie accomplishment. This authority will not be delegated to lower levels. Consecutive
     CONUS sortie substitution is not permitted (not applicable to FTU and Det 6 AMCAOS
     personnel).
     4.5.3.6. Pilots who completed the Aircraft Commander Air Refueling course, but have
     not been certified as aircraft commanders, can maintain AR currency on operational or
     local missions under the supervision of an ARIP.
     4.5.3.7. Mission profile simulators (G250 and G261-G264) will be flown in the same
     manner as the aircraft to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets, helmets,
     etc.).
        4.5.3.7.1. Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS (if able), and
        sortie cancellation authority will reside with the OG/CC (or designated
        representative).
        4.5.3.7.2. Pre-requisites for simulator training must be completed prior to the period
        start time or the training will be cancelled.

NOTES:
1. Pilots (FPQ) with less than 500 PAI hours should accomplish 50 percent of their proficiency sorties in the
aircraft. One G250 per semiannual period may be substituted at Sq/DO discretion.
2. Detachment 6 AMCAOS and FTU pilots maintaining MR status will participate as primary or additional
crewmembers on one overseas sortie during each semiannual period.
3. Instructor and evaluator pilots may credit 50 percent of semiannual M030 requirements when performing
instructor or evaluator duties from the jump seat on overseas sorties.
4. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months in this event leads to unqualified status (See paragraph 4.9.2.2).
Pilots dual-certified in legacy and AMP-modified aircraft must comply with guidance in paragraph 5.8.4.1.3.
5. Required once AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Tactics Certification is completed.

NOTES:
1. First FEs and higher may log proficiency sorties in the WST (log an M011).
Simulator sorties that include a full mission profile (takeoff, landing and all associated
checklists) may update 60-day currency. Note: 60-day sortie currency may not be
regained in the simulator. Do not credit consecutive 60-day sorties in the simulator.
FEs dual-certified in legacy and AMP-modified aircraft must accomplish an AMP sortie
and inspection every 60 days and a legacy sortie and inspection every 180 days.
2. P145 may be accomplished in the WST.
3. ACDTQT should be accomplished in the WST. N/A to FTU crewmembers. P280 is
Triennial for FTL A, Biennial for FTL B, and Annual for FTL C.
4. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months in this event leads to unqualified status.
5. Local sorties may be accomplished while non-current for this event.
6. Not applicable to NAF and MAJCOM staff.
7. Loadmasters need only attend one mission-oriented simulator training (MOST) period
annually.

1. Mandatory grounding event after expiration date.
2. May qualify for 'academics only' or Executive Refresher Course. See AFI11-
403 for details.
3. This event does not satisfy the instrument open book examination
requirement within the check cycle.
4. Member will go unqualified if non-current in this event for greater than 6
months.
5. May accomplish 100% in the WST.
6. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is
accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous
physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF AF FORM
1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address
waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight
Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.


4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons require one sortie in
any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for flying continuation-
training requirements. See paragraph 4.9.1.1.3 for regaining mission ready status.
   4.6.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in this MDS as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
   assigned flight surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they are
   granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC
   8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The AC
   or their designated crewmember must also give FS a briefing on oxygen equipment and
   egress procedures prior to flight. Note: Initial Qualification requirements (in Chapters 2 and
   3) only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
       4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
       following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS20 (S-V80-A), and G120.
4.7. Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI
11-2C-5v1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. IAW AFI
11-202v1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver
has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manager representative to ensure compliance with
additional non-aircrew specific training requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties and for non-availability due to contingency alerts
and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training for certain mission
events. This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same
crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.
 40                                                              AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1, e.g., 5.6 rounds to 5.
         4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
         absence is at least 15 cumulative days.
         4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
         to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
         accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
         available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
         available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for
         CONUS and 14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment
         of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments
         from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.           If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements.
   4.9.1. Loss of Currency. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires;
   (e.g., a crewmember that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September
   becomes non-current on 1 November).
         4.9.1.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in supervised
         training status for that event and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event.
         Loss of currency prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties
         in the non-current event(s). For example, if the individual is non-current for receiver air
         refueling, the individual may fly unsupervised on sorties which are not scheduled for and
         do not accomplish receiver air refueling. Exception: An individual non-current in
         takeoffs (P020), landings (P190), or approaches (P070), will not fly unsupervised on any
         sortie.
         4.9.1.2. Aircraft commanders who are not current for an overseas sortie may fly in
         command on operational CONUS missions. Aircraft commanders may regain overseas
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                   41


     currency under the supervision of a qualified aircraft commander or higher. Pilots can
     regain currency while being supervised by a current and qualified pilot or higher in the
     jumpseat. When a pilot or higher is not available to occupy the jumpseat, the noncurrent
     pilot must be supervised by an instructor or higher in the left seat.
     4.9.1.3. Aircraft commanders who are not current for air refueling may not fly in
     command on missions requiring air refueling until currency is regained. If noncurrent for
     less than 15 days, they may regain currency on operational AR missions, if no passengers
     are carried, under the supervision of a qualified AC or higher after the fuel required for
     mission completion is on loaded.
     4.9.1.4. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
     Command Surgeon of Flight Surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties (AMC units
     send notification to AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC).
  4.9.2. Regaining Currency.
     4.9.2.1. For a loss of currency up to 6 months, a crewmember must demonstrate
     proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as determined by Sq/CC or DO) with an AF or
     ATS instructor, as applicable, in all delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for less
     than 6 months will maintain their current training level (no training folder required).
     Flight engineers may only regain 60-day sortie currency in the aircraft.
     4.9.2.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. For events identified in Tables 4.4 and
     4.5 as leading to unqualified status, the crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft and
     must complete Sq/CC-directed requalification training and an aircrew evaluation
     according to AFI 11-2C-5v2. For all other currency events, regain currency according to
     paragraph 4.9.2.1
     4.9.2.3. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require completion of
     LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a certified aircrew instructor
     prior to the next flight. Flight surgeons that exceed 60 days between sorties require a
     review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems conducted by a member of the flight crew
     designated by the Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to the flight to regain flying currency.
     The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the AMC/SGP memo or
     other approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated form/memo, etc.) Note:
     documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable.
         4.9.2.3.1. The Flight surgeon must submit this documentation to the local
         Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or
         upon return to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or
         SARM will place the documentation in the flight surgeon‘s training folder.
         4.9.2.3.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will
         result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
  4.9.3. Failure to Complete Semiannual Flying Training Events. At the end of each training
  period, the Sq/CC will review ARMS products for crewmembers that fail to accomplish all
  required flying continuation training. Sq/CC will direct training necessary for the individual
  to regain MR status using the process for regaining currency (see paragraph 4.9.2.2) or
  request an OG/CC waiver for the requirement (see paragraph 1.5.7). Base the decision to
 42                                                            AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


   approve a waiver on the individual crewmember's experience and proficiency level and only
   for unforeseen circumstances (i.e., waivers will not be based on a crewmember's availability).
   The OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver (e.g., 30-day extension,
   next training cycle, etc.). OG/CC should consider if sufficient flying events were
   accomplished to ensure MR proficiency before waiver approval. The OG/CC cannot waive
   the same flying training event deficiency for a second consecutive training period. Waiver
   requests must be forwarded to MAJCOM/A3T.
   4.9.4. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.
       4.9.4.1. Failure to complete ground continuation training events in Table 4.1 leads to
       NMR status, which prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight
       duties until the delinquent event is completed or waived.
       4.9.4.2. Failure to complete Mobility Training events in Table 4.2 does not affect MR
       status, but restricts crewmembers from performing missions that require the delinquent
       events (s) until the required training is accomplished.
       4.9.4.3. With the exception of the flight physical, physiological training, and LL03, the
       OG/CC or equivalent may waive ground continuation training events. This waiver
       authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
       individual crewmember‘s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based
       on a crewmember‘s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the
       waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This
       waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and for events that will not degrade mission
       accomplishment.
   4.9.5. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   4.9.6. See AFI 11-202v1 for individuals leaving active flying status.
4.10. Requirements before PCS or TDY by Members on Active Flying Status. AFI 11-
202v1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.11. Requirements before Removal from Active Flying. AFI 11-202v1 specifies
requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While in Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202v1 specifies requirements
while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202v1 specifies retraining restrictions before separation, retirement,
or mandatory inactive flying status.
4.14. Aircrews Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft or with Non-USAF Units. AFI 11-202v1
addresses individuals flying in this status.
4.15. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on 6-month periods (1 January -
30 June and 1 July - 31 December).
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                        43

                                    UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade. See minimum flying-hour requirements and prerequisites in Table 5.1.
   5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot having
   gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit‘s missions.
   Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas. Flying
   experience must include left seat time before entering formal school upgrade training. AC
   candidates will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions before
   entering the formal upgrade program. Note: WST time may be credited towards PAA time
   (N/A AFRC).
   5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for flying hour prerequisites for entry into
   formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1).
   5.1.3. Complete applicable ground and flying requirements of this instruction.
   5.1.4. ETCA lists prerequisites and special requirements for the formal school AC upgrade
   course. Units should work directly with their MAJCOM PFT quota managers (AMC Active
   Duty is AMC/A3TF) to fill available upgrade training slots no later than 45 days before the
   class start date.

NOTES:
1. 100 C-5 hours PAA required before R&C to perform AC duties.
2. Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a
military pilot including SUPT ―student‖ and ―other‖ time (but does not include time in
another aircrew specialty). Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.
3. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set, e.g., C-17, KC-135, etc., complete ACIQ; MPD
Phase II guide is not required. Pilots with dissimilar background, i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.,
complete ACIQ; accomplish MPD Phase II guide in-unit.
4. Not required for prior evaluators.

5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is a development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from PIQ or
ACIQ formal training courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates
in certification as an Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three
phases: MPD Phase I (V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will
be dual-seat qualified and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2C-5,
Volume 2. MPD pilots are not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in
Table 5.1.
    5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots‘ being mentored and provided
    with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
    based on performance and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an
    individual‘s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training through Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
    5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as V280
    and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
    completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification.
    5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
    AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
    5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter Phase I of
    continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which
    focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems
    knowledge, and basic mission planning. Phase I MPD pilots should not have additional
    squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commanders. They should observe and
    learn from their aircrew leadership.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                    45


     5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
     right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat under the supervision of an IP. Phase
     I MPD pilots will train in the right seat during refresher simulators and may occupy the
     left or right seat for proficiency simulators and available proficiency time at the end of a
     refresher simulator. Phase I MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180
     days (365 days for ARC) after becoming mission ready.
     5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
     months from the training start date (as defined in 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA
     (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these requirements
     are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP. Note: MPD
     pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue under the
     previous             GRACC              workbook            for           up         to
     6 months beyond the release date of this AFI at Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with
     all other requirements in this paragraph. For FAIP/OSA or non-mobility weapon system
     pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft, completion of V280 is not required; however, V281
     and V282 are required.
  5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
  which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
  management required for Aircraft Commander certification.
     5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure MPD pilots‘ balanced exposure to both left and
     right seats in the aircraft under the supervision of an AC or higher. Good judgment and
     Operational Risk Management (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they
     occupy. As Phase II MPD pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice
     actual mission management skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or
     IP.
     5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II MPD
     pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD Phase
     II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II MPD
     pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD pilots
     require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready certification and
     prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or
     non- mobility weapon system pilots).
     5.3.4.3. AMC Orientation Tour/GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth look
     at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to interact
     with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
     Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal Aircraft
     Commander upgrade training (PCO). GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and highly
     encouraged for AFRC and ANG mobility forces pilots upgrading to Aircraft Commander.
     GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon systems. For AMC pilots, V282
     will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander certification. If unable to complete V282
     prior to certification, units may schedule attendance up to 90 days after certification;
     beyond 90 days requires OG/CC approval. See paragraph 1.18.7 for scheduling details.
     Additional           information        is         available         via         ETCA:
     https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
 46                                                               AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


   5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Pilot Checkout (PCO). The Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an
   upgrade training start date when the upgrade candidate begins applicable PCO training
   events, as required (see Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limitations). Prior to starting
   training, the training office will open and maintain an AF Form 4022 until the upgrade
   candidate is certified as an Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a
   pilots training progress may combine those into a single training folder at the unit‘s
   discretion. Training guides are authorized.
       5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
       Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
       direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight. Two Aircraft Commander
       candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP supervision in the simulator, as
       required.
       5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
       prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
           5.3.5.2.1. ATS course ACMQ-II, (Pilot Mission Qualification Phase-II).           See
           paragraph 6.7.5.
           5.3.5.2.2. AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Tactics Certification.
           5.3.5.2.3. ACAR (if required).
           5.3.5.2.4. Local Left Seat Proficiency Sortie.
           5.3.5.2.5. LTMs/Recommendation Ride.
           5.3.5.2.6. Operational Mission Evaluation (OME) completed IAW AFI 11-2C-5,
           Volume 2.       Note: Specific order of accomplishment is not mandated; however,
           ACMQ-II should be the first training event and will establish the training time start
           IAW paragraph 1.7. TET and AR may be accomplished once an individual has been
           identified for upgrade. It is highly recommended that tactics certification be
           accomplished prior to the LTM process; however, it will be accomplished prior to the
           OME. The OME typically will be the last event completed prior to Sq/CC
           certification (Exception: air refueling may occur after certification dependent upon
           mission requirements and class availability).
       5.3.5.3. Aircraft Commander candidates must be current in applicable Mission
       Certification Training events listed in Table 3.1 prior to certification.
   5.3.6. Aircrew Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For
   standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status
   for a MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate)). Active duty
   loadmasters will use the ARMS code ―FL‖ to designate NMR status. (This ARMS code does
   not affect the ML qualification status listed on the AF Form 8.)

Table 5.2. Pilot Designation Codes.
If first two are ―FP‖   Qualified Pilot. Then 3rd character is:
                                           Qualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This is used for

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. The instructor course is designed to teach selected
crewmembers fundamentals and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected
based on experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
48                                                             AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


  5.4.1. Individuals who complete the applicable instructor course are qualified instructors for
  all mission qualification events in which they maintain currency.
  5.4.2. New instructor candidates will attend the formal C-5 ATS instructor course. Waivers
  will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis if formal school course slots are not available.
  5.4.3. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor course for instructor
  qualification and were certified in any US Air Force or Navy fixed-wing aircraft may
  upgrade in-unit without completing the ATS instructor course. In-unit instructor upgrades
  require OG/CC approval. MAJCOM waivers are not required. Unit commanders determine
  training required to complete upgrade. Instructor candidates who attend the ATS instructor
  qualification course at the FTU or in-unit may incur an ADSC IAW AFI 36-2107. All initial
  instructor upgrade candidates must be mission-ready for a minimum of 6 months.
  5.4.4. Instructor Responsibilities:
     5.4.4.1. Instructors are responsible to provide thorough preflight briefings and critiques.
     Instructors will comply with requirements of mission outlines, as appropriate, for the type
     mission being flown.
     5.4.4.2. Instructors will review each student‘s training record prior to performing each
     training flight or session.
     5.4.4.3. Instructors will ensure all required upgrade training items are completed, signed
     off, and proficiency demonstrated IAW AFI 11-2C-5v2 grading criteria before
     recommending the student for evaluation, or certifying the student as qualified in a tactic
     or mission. Instructors should further ensure training, operations sections, and the flight
     commander or designated representative is apprised of the student‘s status.
     5.4.4.4. IPs must be fully aware they are responsible at all times for flight conduct and
     aircraft safety. Should the student‘s judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a
     question in the instructor‘s mind as to the student‘s ability to safely complete a prescribed
     maneuver at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately assume aircraft
     control. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper tactics, techniques,
     and procedures for the maneuver prior to the trainee resuming control of the aircraft. All
     instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for positively identifying
     emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.
  5.4.5. Instructor pilot candidates will qualify through the ATS Instructor Aircraft
  Commander Qualification (IP) course.
     5.4.5.1. Aerial refueling instructor pilot candidates will complete the ATS Instructor
     Pilot Aerial Refueling Qualification (ARIP). ARIPs must be able to instruct both KC-
     135 and KC-10 AR receiver procedures. IP and ARIP may be accomplished together
     provided the academic and simulator portions of both courses are completed prior to the
     flying phase.
  5.4.6. Instructor flight engineer candidates will qualify through the ATS Flight Engineer
  Instructor (IFE) Qualification course.
  5.4.7. Instructor loadmaster candidates will qualify through the ATS Loadmaster Instructor
  Qualification (ILM) course.
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     49


       5.4.7.1. All qualified C-5 LMs are authorized to use the C-5 Automated Form F (AFF)
       program during the ILM course.
   5.4.8. All aircrew member instructor candidates will satisfactorily complete a written
   examination on this instruction prior to qualification. The IP written examination will also
   include simulated aircraft emergency training and applicable training restrictions published in
   AFI 11-202v3, General Flight Rules, AFI 11-2C-5v3, and other appropriate operational
   directives.
5.5. Flight Examiner Upgrade.
   5.5.1. Flight Examiners. Sq/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner certification.
   Instructors identified for certification as flight examiner must possess superior knowledge of
   AMC training and evaluation policies and procedures, and the ability to administer an
   evaluation according to applicable publications.
   5.5.2. Flight examiner candidates will attend the ATS flight examiner course for their crew
   position. Sq/CCs may waive this requirement if the candidate is a previously qualified flight
   examiner in any AMC aircraft. In this case, flight examiner candidates should:
       5.5.2.1. Observe qualified evaluators conducting a cross-section of evaluations, to
       include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge.
       5.5.2.2. Receive a briefing on command policies and interpretations of AFI 11-202,
       Volumes 1 and 2, 11-2C-5, Volumes 1 and 2, and MAJCOM supplements.
   5.5.3. Candidates with no prior flight examiner experience should observe an evaluation
   before certification.
5.6. Aerial Refueling Qualification.
   5.6.1. Aerial Refueling Training. Aircrew members designated to qualify in AR will
   complete requirements of this section. Previously qualified AR pilots will re-qualify through
   Sq/CC-directed training.
       5.6.1.1. All ground training will be conducted by qualified instructors and completed
       prior to entering the flying phase. Reference materials are AFI 11-2C-5v3; Technical
       Order (T.O.) 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual C-5A, C-5A (SCM), and C-5B, T.O 1C-5M-1,
       Flight Manual C-5M and C-5M (SCM) Airplanes, T.O. 1C-5A-1-1, Flight Manual USAF
       Series C-5A and C-5B Airplanes, Appendix I, Performance Data, T.O. 1C-5M-1-1, Flight
       Manual Appendix 1 Performance Data USAF Series C-5M and C-5M (SCM) Airplanes,
       T.O. 1-1C-1, Mission Crew Flight Manual C-5A, C-5A(SCM), and C-5B Air Refueling
       Procedures With KC-135 and KC-10, and AR checklist. Crewmembers will be trained in
       areas applicable to their crew position.
       5.6.1.2. Aircraft Commander AR Training:
          5.6.1.2.1. The normal method for completing aircraft commander AR qualification
          will be the aircraft commander aerial refueling (ACAR) course at the FTU. Trainees
          will complete the ATS pilot aerial refueling qualification (PAR) course prior to
          starting aircraft training flights.
          5.6.1.2.2. Units should provide aircraft commander AR candidates training in the
          ARPTT/WST prior to reporting to the FTU. The AR candidate should receive a
 50                                                            AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


          minimum of 3 hours of instruction. Emphasis should be on closure, maintaining pre-
          contact, and contact. Each trainee will receive the full ATS ACAR course at the
          FTU, but may proficiency advance into the flight phase. Squadrons should schedule
          candidates for ARPTT/WST training as close to the FTU reporting date as practical.
          ARPTT/WST training, once started, should continue uninterrupted. This training
          should not take precedence over normal continuation training. ARPTT/WST crew-
          pair training is encouraged.
          5.6.1.2.3. Pilot Not Flying (PNF) ARPTT/WST Training. An ARIP will instruct and
          assist the PNF in performing normal PNF AR duties, including checklists and radio
          procedures. The goal is for the PNF to effectively act as a safety observer during AR
          and maintain aircraft position between pre-contact and 100 feet in trail. The instructor
          will stabilize aircraft in a position 50-100 feet behind the tanker and allow the PNF to
          practice holding this position until reasonable degree of stability is attained. The
          instructor will then demonstrate correct pre-contact and contact positions. Note: Units
          without an ARPTT or WST can conduct training on the aircraft.
5.7. Tactical Training.
   5.7.1. The C-5 Tactical Training Program certifies C-5 pilots to conduct flying operations in
   a threat environment. Units will conduct C-5 tactical training using the most current
   MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent, guidance. Refer to the AMC/A3T CoP.
   5.7.2. This program includes training on current techniques for implementing the Combat
   Entry/Exit Checklist, conducting combat mission planning (with special emphasis on threat
   avoidance and mitigation using AFMSS), and use of the Defensive System (DS). This
   program provides hands on training in tactical arrival and departure maneuvers necessary to
   certify crewmembers as tactical mission ready pilots.
   5.7.3. Certification and Evaluation. After being recommended for certification by an IP, the
   Sq/CC will document certification on AF Form 4324 using block 22 and forward the
   completed form to the unit ARMS section for processing. Aircraft commanders and above
   will be prepared to demonstrate knowledge and correct procedures on evaluations.
   5.7.4. Training Course Management. AMC/A3T is the OPR for tactical training course
   administration and syllabus development and maintenance.
5.8. Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Differences Training.
   5.8.1. The C-5 AMP Training Program is designed to certify C-5 pilots, flight engineers, and
   loadmasters to operate AMP-modified C-5 aircraft in the Air Traffic
   Management/Communication Navigation Surveillance (ATM/CNS) system.
   5.8.2. Aircrew members will accomplish an ATS contractor taught AMP differences course
   developed for their crew positions. The differences courses consist of computer-based
   training (CBT), instructor-based review, and, for pilots and flight engineers, training in the
   WST.
       5.8.2.1. Pilots. Mission-qualified pilots will complete the ATS AMP differences training
       course with training in an AMP-modified WST or airplane, an evaluation consisting of
       the general and instrument evaluation requisites outlined in AFI 11-2C-5 Volume 2,
       Chapter 2, and Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, an aircraft proficiency sortie
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     51


     (M010), and AMP sorties as described below. The flight evaluation may be conducted in
     either the airplane or the WST. This flight evaluation will be documented as ―SPOT‖ on
     the AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification, and include the following
     statement in the remarks section, ―This flight evaluation was conducted in conjunction
     with C-5 AMP certification.‖ Pilots that complete all requisites may elect to reset their
     QUAL/INST/MSN evaluation cycle by completing all areas under GENERAL,
     QUALIFICATION/MISSION, INSTRUMENT, and TACTICS (if certified). Document
     certification on an AF Form 4324 using block 22 and forward completed form to the unit
     ARMS section for processing.
        5.8.2.1.1. AMP Sortie Requirements. To credit an AMP sortie, an aircraft
        commander or pilot must occupy the pilot or copilot seat for a takeoff, cruise segment
        of at least 30 minutes, and a full stop landing. Either the takeoff or landing must be
        performed away from the home station. Additionally, up to 50% of the AMP sortie
        requirements may be accomplished on local air refueling sorties (takeoff and landing
        at home station), with a cruise segment of at least 30 minutes prior to the ARIP,
        provided the pilot occupies either the pilot or copilot seat for the takeoff, cruise
        segment, and landing.
            5.8.2.1.1.1. Pilots will complete eight AMP sorties including two overseas.
            5.8.2.1.1.2. Aircraft Commanders. Prior to being in-command, pilots will
            complete eight AMP sorties including two overseas.
            5.8.2.1.1.3. Experienced Aircraft Commanders. Aircraft commanders with 100
            AMP hours may supervise other pilots with less than four AMP sorties.
            5.8.2.1.1.4. Instructor Pilots. Prior to being in-command of training sorties,
            instructor pilots must complete eight AMP sorties and a ―buddy ride‖ with
            another AMP instructor pilot on a local training sortie.
     5.8.2.2. Flight Engineers. Flight engineers will complete the following to certify in
     AMP:
        5.8.2.2.1. The ATS AMP differences training course.
        5.8.2.2.2. Two preflight trainers one of which may be accomplished in the simulator.
        Note: Pre-flights accomplished during differences course do not satisfy this
        requirement.
        5.8.2.2.3. Three AMP flight events under the supervision of an AMP
        instructor. Note: AMP flight event is defined as same requirements to log M010.
     5.8.2.3. Second flight engineers will complete the differences course as part of first flight
     engineer upgrade training.
     5.8.2.4. Loadmasters. Loadmasters will complete the ATS AMP differences training
     course designed for loadmasters. Training should consist of hands-on familiarization and
     operation of required equipment associated with AMP modification (radios, interphone,
     etc.) conducted in an AMP-modified aircraft or simulator. Instructors should emphasize
     criteria outlined in AFI 11-2C-5v2, Chapter 5, Area 18, Aircraft Systems
     Knowledge/Operation and Area 24, Other Emergency Procedures. Instructors should use
     the C-5 Loadmaster Master Task List/Evaluation Standards Document as the standard
52                                                            AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


     criteria for certification. Document certification on an AF Form 4324 using blocks 1
     through 5 and 11 through 13 and forward completed form to the unit ARMS section for
     processing.
  5.8.3. Dual Certification Policy. During unit AMP conversion, some crewmembers may
  need to maintain dual certification (AMP and Legacy). However, the intent is to minimize
  dual certification. The decision to allow dual certification rests with the OG/CC. Group
  Commanders should use the 3.6 crew ratio as a guide to balance the number of AMP vs.
  Legacy certified aircrews. Squadrons will use the Review and Certification process to
  recommend individuals for dual certification. Crewmembers will not remain dual certified
  once all unit aircraft are AMP-modified (Exception: AMC/A3V personnel). OG/CCs will
  use the following restrictions/guidelines.
     5.8.3.1. Pilots.
         5.8.3.1.1. Recent (within six months) arrivals (FAIP/OSA/Crossflow and SUPT) will
         not be dual certified.
         5.8.3.1.2. Recommend single certification (AMP or Legacy) for attached, on-loan, or
         squadron personnel with limited availability to fly based on additional duties.
         5.8.3.1.3. In addition to standard monthly currency (takeoff, approach, and landing),
         which may be accomplished in either aircraft, dual certified pilots must also
         accomplish a takeoff, approach, and landing in each aircraft every other month.
         5.8.3.1.4. Pilots that exceed two months between a takeoff, approach, and landing in
         a particular aircraft may regain currency under direct instructor supervision. Pilots
         that exceed three months between a takeoff, approach, and landing in a particular
         aircraft lose certification in that aircraft. Recertification requires OG/CC approval.
     5.8.3.2. Flight Engineers (First Engineers or higher).
         5.8.3.2.1. Dual certified FEs must accomplish an AMP sortie and inspection every 60
         days. A legacy sortie and inspection must be accomplished every 180 days. Note:
         This does not eliminate the AFI 11-2C-5v1 60-day sortie and inspection
         requirements.
         5.8.3.2.2. FEs that exceed 60 days but no more than 120 days between AMP
         sorties/inspections may regain currency by accomplishing the overdue event(s) under
         the supervision of an instructor. Greater than 120 days requires additional training as
         determined by the squadron commander.
         5.8.3.2.3. FEs that exceed 180 days between legacy currency lose their dual
         certification and are now AMP only (Exception: AMC/A3V personnel). Re-
         certification requires OG/CC approval.
     5.8.3.3. Second Flight Engineers. Dual certification is recommended for second FEs to
     take advantage of all first engineer upgrade training opportunities.
         5.8.3.3.1. Dual certified second FEs must accomplish a M010 sortie and P360
         inspection in both aircraft every 120 days.
         5.8.3.3.2. Second FEs who exceed 120 days but no more than 180 days between
         AMP and/or Legacy sorties/inspections may regain currency by accomplishing the
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                    53


          overdue event(s) under the supervision of an instructor. Greater than 180 days results
          in loss of dual certification. Recertification requires OG/CC approval.
      5.8.3.4. Loadmasters. All loadmasters may be dual certified.
   5.8.4. AMP pilots and flight engineers returning to legacy aircraft will requalify IAW
   paragraph 2.9.
5.9. C-5M Qualification Training.
   5.9.1. The C-5M Training Program is designed to qualify C-5 pilots and flight engineers,
   and certify loadmasters to operate C-5 aircraft modified through the Reliability Enhancement
   and Re-engining Program (RERP). The pilot and flight engineer courses will normally
   culminate in a complete flight evaluation at the previous C-5 qualification level to include
   Air Refueling qualification, as applicable.
   5.9.2. Differences Training Prerequisites. PMD and FEMD are intended to prepare C-5
   AMP qualified crewmembers for qualification in the C-5M. However, individuals
   unqualified in C-5 AMP may complete the AFI 11-202 V1 required requalification training
   and AMC/A3T approved AMP differences training, as appropriate, in conjunction with
   PMD/FEMD. AMP qualified crewmembers non-current 6 months or less are not required to
   regain currency in C-5 AMP or incur any additional training requirements provided
   PMD/FEMD satisfies the currency lost (i.e., Proficiency Sortie, Refresher Simulator, etc.).
   5.9.3. Interim Differences Training. Until the WST and ATS are ready for training, Dover
   instructors will conduct all Pilot C-5M Differences (PMD) and Flight Engineer C-5M
   Differences (FEMD) training. Differences training will utilize AMC/A3T-approved syllabi.
   The training consists of instructor-based presentation academics, ground aircraft, E-Sim, and
   aircraft flying training. Academic training (not including the E-Sim) may be conducted by
   the ATS contractor using AMC/A3T-approved courseware. Evaluations will be completed
   IAW AFI 11-2C-5, Vol 2 guidance for periodic qualification evaluations. Evaluations will be
   documented as Initial evaluations and establish checkride eligibility periods accordingly.
      5.9.3.1. Completion of the C-5M differences course will satisfy the requirement for one
      quarter of annual simulator refresher training (G261-264) for pilots and flight engineers,
      and the annual Aircraft Systems Refresher (G220).
      5.9.3.2. Squadron loadmaster instructors will conduct locally-developed,         AMC-
      approved loadmaster differences certification training until an ATS course is available.

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The C-5 ATS is a qualification, upgrade, and continuation training program
for C5 pilots, FEs, LMs, and maintenance engine run technicians. Most ground training is
provided by the ATS contractor while the Air Force conducts all flight training and administers
all flight evaluations. The goal of the C5 ATS is to train C-5 aircrew members to the standards
set in the master task list (MTL) and evaluation standards document (ESD). In achieving this
goal, the ATS contractor trains crews through the use of CBT, cockpit procedures trainers (CPT),
and WSTs. This section is a ―how to‖ book on using the ATS and developed as a tool for C5
aircrew managers at the squadron, group, and wing. It is directive in nature, complementing
guidance elsewhere in this instruction and contractor-provided courseware material.
6.2. General Information.
   6.2.1. Applicability. This chapter applies to all AMC, AFRC, and ANG personnel using the
   C-5 ATS.
   6.2.2. Responsibilities.
       6.2.2.1. ATS Contractor. Each ATS site will provide academic and ATD training for C-
       5 crewmember requalification, upgrade, senior staff, difference, and continuation training
       programs to meet course objectives.
       6.2.2.2. AMC/A3T is the overall management authority for C-5 contract training and
       will:
           6.2.2.2.1. Ensure that contractor-provided academic and ATD training complies with
           policies, guidelines, and directives established by AMC headquarters and the current
           training contract.
           6.2.2.2.2. Ensure performance objectives for contractor-provided training are
           achieved by monitoring overall contractor performance and submitting quality

  6.2.4. ATS Course Prerequisites.      Each ATS course is designed and based on certain
  prerequisites being met by the student prior to entry. Prerequisites may include a minimum
  number of flying hours, recommendation of the squadron operations officer, and the
  completion of some form of training guide. Consult the appropriate paragraph of this chapter
  and the course summary document (CSD) to determine student entry level for each.
  6.2.5. ATS Course Prework. Some ATS courses require trainee preparation prior to class.
  This prework is considered an integral portion of the course and must be accomplished in
  order to receive completion credit. Prework may consist of reviewing study references,
  quizzes, takeoff and landing data preparation, or any combination of the above. In every
  case, the required prework is described in the appropriate student guide. When required, the
  ATS contractor will ensure training guides are distributed to units in time for prework
  completion.
  6.2.6. Course Material. All student guides, training guides, etc., will be provided by the
  ATS contractor. Local procedures will be developed by unit training offices to ensure that
  students bring the current version of the material to the start of each class.
  6.2.7. Terminology.
     6.2.7.1. Aircrew training device (ATD)—includes CPTs, PTTs, and WSTs.
     6.2.7.2. Part Task Trainer (PTT)—device used to practice a specific task such as Flight
     Management System operation, cargo door operation, or aerial refueling. This device
     develops skills independent of other mission tasks.
     6.2.7.3. Weapon System Trainer (WST)—device which provides a synthetic flight and
     tactics environment in which aircrews learn, develop, improve, and integrate the skills
     associated with their crew positions. Crew positions may operate individually or as a
     team.
     6.2.7.4. Computer Based Training (CBT)—ground training system which uses computer
     generated graphics and text in conjunction with interactive video as the primary medium
     of instruction.
     6.2.7.5. Browser—An individual who views or reviews CBT lessons or courses, on an
     as-available basis, but not in direct fulfillment of an ATS course in which he or she is
     enrolled, e.g., a C-5 pilot might view first FE lessons as a ―browser‖ to improve
     knowledge of FE normal procedures.
6.3. MTL/ESD.
  6.3.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD was developed through a joint contractor and Air
  Force effort and provides the basis for ATS courseware development. AMC/A3T has
  approved the MTL/ESD as the baseline document for validating C-5 aircrew member
  performance. Flight examiners and instructors who evaluate or train C-5 crewmembers will
  use criteria established by the MTL/ESD to determine the ability of an individual to meet the
  performance levels required to be mission-qualified.
  6.3.2. MTL/ESD Use. The MTL/ESD will be used as a reference document by flight
  examiners and instructors to establish standards in the training and evaluation of C5 aircrew
  members. Distribution of the MTL/ESD is sufficient to ensure that each squadron has
  reference copies for each crew position. Recommended changes will be submitted through
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                      61


   Air Force channels using the ATS contractor's quality assurance change proposal (QACP)
   process (see paragraph 6.15).
6.4. Air Force and ATS Contractor Interface.
   6.4.1. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
      6.4.1.1. If progress is considered unsatisfactory at any time during a student's training,
      the ATS contractor will notify the responsible Air Force representative (training office,
      squadron operations officer, etc.). Following a joint Air Force and ATS contractor
      review of the identified student's record, the Air Force will determine to continue or
      terminate training.
      6.4.1.2. The ATS contractor will provide written feedback to the squadron operations
      officer on students who display substandard performance, lack of preparation or
      participation, or poor attitude during annual proficiency and refresher training.
      6.4.1.3. Remediation Procedures. The ATS contractor must receive prompt notification
      of failed flight evaluations that culminate an ATS course. Local procedures must ensure
      that this notification is completed within 24 hours of the failure for local evaluations and
      within 24 hours after return to home station for off station evaluations. The appropriate
      MTL/ESD task must be referenced for all failed evaluations. Student remediation
      subsequent to a failed flight evaluation may be the ATS contractor's responsibility, Air
      Force's responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending on the nature of the failure. In
      every case, close coordination is required to achieve maximum student progress. Direct
      contact with the appropriate ATS contractor instructor supervisor is encouraged.
      6.4.1.4. It is essential the AMC evaluation, to guarantee standards, be conducted in a
      timely manner following the student's completion of the contractor-conducted training.
   6.4.2. Flight ATS Contractor Flight Operations.
      6.4.2.1. IAW AFI 11-401 and the C-5 Aircrew Training System contract, C-5 ATS

          following their students' completion of the WST phase of instruction in formal
          courses. Instructors will be considered AMC unqualified aircrew members. They are
          authorized a seat on the flight deck, if available, during any phase of flight.
          Emergency procedures and touch-and-go landings may be accomplished. Instructors
          will not be allowed access to aircraft controls, nor will they occupy a primary crew
          position.
          6.4.2.1.2. On overseas missions, the instructors must remain with their home station
          crew unless the mission is re-routed to a sensitive or possible hostile area. In this
          case the instructors may join a C-5 mission going back to home station or return at
          ATS contractor‘s expense.
          6.4.2.1.3. Contractor Simulator Certification Pilots. The contractor's designated

         contractor flight personnel due to mission diversions, delays, or cancellations.
         6.4.2.3.2. Contractor personnel will be subject to medical examination and
         toxicological testing if involved in an aircraft mishap. Commanders will use
         discretion in determining when contractor flight personnel are to be examined or
         tested. Contractor flight personnel will also provide written statements and other
         information relating to the mishap as required by the mishap investigator. Contractor
         statements are protected under the privileged, limited use provisions of AFI 91-204,
         Safety Investigations and Reports.
         6.4.2.3.3. Contractor instructors and pilots, when flying on local flights will be
         designated ―MEP‖ in the crew position column of the AMC Form 41, Flight
         Authorization Order. Pilots will be designated as ―CP UNQ‖ in the crew
         qualification column, engineers as ―FE UNQ‖.
         6.4.2.3.4. Each C-5 contractor site manager will designate in writing those contractor
         instructors and simulator test pilots eligible for participation in flight operations.
         Simulator test pilot eligibility is limited to one at each site possessing a WST. These
         lists will be provided to the AF Site Project Officer and AMC/A3TA. The contractor
         will immediately notify the Air Force of employees who are terminated or no longer
         eligible to participate in flight operations.
6.5. Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   6.5.1. CRM Development. CRM has been designed to train aircrew members to cope with
   potential problems in human behavior affecting a crew's performance. Documented studies
   of aircraft accidents and additional data suggest most human behavior problems observed
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                     63


   among aircrews could be grouped into three categories: interpersonal communications,
   situational awareness, and flight team leadership.
   6.5.2. CRM Program. CRM is presented on a recurring basis throughout the C5 ATS. An
   introduction to CRM is presented during initial qualification training. Two mission oriented
   simulator training (MOST) missions are presented during the annual simulator proficiency.
   These simulator periods are dedicated to reviewing and applying CRM principles during
   simulated operational mission scenarios.
6.6. ATS Courses.
   6.6.1. Continua Overview.
      6.6.1.1. 30 courses make up the C-5 ATS. Qualification levels in each continuum reflect
      progression of crewmember training from entry status through upgrade to flight
      examiner. A crewmember's point of entry into a continuum is dependent on previous
      experience and training, current crew qualification in the C-5, and currency status.
      Paragraphs 6.7, 6.8, and 6.9. provide additional details for each of the individual courses.
      Use of ATS courses for qualification, upgrade, and refresher is mandatory unless waived
      by AMC/A3TA.

6.10. Continuation Training.
   6.10.1. Pilot and FE Proficiency Course (PREF or FEREF) (FTU, MOB) (8). This course
   builds on experience gained since completing initial qualification courses. While primarily
   designed for a qualified crewmember, it may also be used to train crewmembers who are
   temporarily in an unqualified status. Prior coordination with unit training office is required
   prior to scheduling unqualified crewmembers. Enrollees must, however, be graduates of a C-
   5 initial qualification course. In the event that unqualified and/or upgrading crewmembers
   attend this course, they are required to bring their training guides so that the ATS contractor
   instructors may review and grade their performance. All items listed on pilot and FE
   MTL/ESDs may be covered during the course. The following additional requirements apply:
      6.10.1.1. Preparation. All assigned takeoff and landing data, reading assignments, and
      quizzes must be completed prior to each mission to earn completion credit. All
      professional equipment and publications must be available for use.
      6.10.1.2. Crew Qualification. Schedule crews as would be scheduled for a normal
      mission. Unqualified and noncurrent crewmembers may be used as fill-ins on a limited
      basis. Squadrons will make every effort to schedule crews in realistic crew complements
      (e.g., aircraft commander, pilot, two first engineers, or a first engineer and a second
      engineer). Missions may be altered to permit flexibility in training; however, all outlined
      items must be completed during the annual ATD program.
      6.10.1.3. Attendance. Crewmembers must attend the entire pre-brief, mission, and
      debrief in order to receive credit for a particular mission
      6.10.1.4. This course consists of two simulator periods conducted quarterly. The first
      simulator period will concentrate on malfunctions, upsets, and normal and emergency
      procedures. The second simulator period will be a Mission-Oriented Simulator Training
      (MOST) mission which emphasizes CRM principles and applications. G230, CRM
      Refresher, may be credited after completion of this course.

   6.10.2. Simulator Proficiency Sortie (SPS) (G250) (MOB) (1). The SPS is a WST sortie
   designed to satisfy M010 and checkride requirements, and accommodate two to three pilots
   under the supervision of an Air Force instructor pilot or an ATS contractor pilot instructor.
   See Chapter 7 for a description of an M010.
   6.10.3. FE Systems Refresher (FESR) (MOB) (5). This maintains FE knowledge and
   proficiency at the mission-qualified level. First flight engineers and higher will attend C-5
   Flight Engineer Systems Refresher (FESR) annually. FESR for second flight engineers is
   optional but encouraged. Individuals who instruct in the FESR may take credit for that
   portion of the course actually taught. FEs who complete Flight Engineer Instructor (IFE) or
   First Flight Engineer Qualification (FFEQ) may credit the FESR.
   6.10.4. LM Refresher Course (LMREF) (MOB) (3). Course is designed to be accomplished
   in 3 days; however, length may vary with individual student proficiency and knowledge.
   LMs will attend refresher training annually. The block training will include all annual
   ground training required to maintain currency. Use LM initial qualification date to establish
   the date training last completed. Individuals who instruct in the LM refresher may take credit
   for that portion of the course actually taught. LMs who attend Loadmaster Initial
   Qualification (LMIQ), Loadmaster Mission Qualification (LMMQ), or the Instructor
   Loadmaster Qualification (ILM) course will satisfy annual refresher training requirements.
   Loadmaster refresher training satisfies the Hazardous Cargo (G182) ground continuation
   training requirement.
      6.10.4.1. Manuals and professional gear are required for accomplishing assessment tests
      and CPT systems training.
      6.10.4.2. A CRM refresher session is included in the LMREF. Because of the interaction
      required, it is imperative to have a full class so the CRM session can meet its objectives.
      6.10.4.3. All qualified C-5 LMs are authorized to use the C-5 AFF program during the
      LMREF.
6.11. Air Force Instructor Flight Training Handbook.
   6.11.1. This publication provides Air Force instructors with general information, guidance
   for administering flight training and evaluations, instructions for completing training records,
   listing of ATS training forms required for each, disposing training records, and recommended
   profiles for training flights. Squadron training offices will maintain a copy of this handbook.
   6.11.2. All personnel are encouraged to submit changes to the handbook according
   paragraph 6.15.
6.12. Scheduling.
   6.12.1. Local Procedures. Local procedures will be developed at each of MOB for
   scheduling ATS students. The unit training office at each MOB will ensure that procedures
   are sufficient to minimize schedule changes and turbulence. Missions will not be scheduled
   with only one flight engineer without the approval of the active duty operations group
   commander (not applicable to AFRC/ANG). ATS contractor personnel will not substitute or
   fill-in for missing or late crewmembers.
   6.12.2. Enrollment. Enrollment for all ATS courses will be accomplished through the unit
   training office at MOBs. Each MOB training office will also establish procedures to
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                    69


   accommodate ANG and AFRC training requirements. Names and other personal data
   required by the ATS contractor will be passed to their scheduler not later than the time
   established by the host training office.
   6.12.3. Class Size. Class size for all ATS courses will be as established in the appropriate
   course summary document (CSD). Every attempt will be made by the MOB training office
   to ensure that all classes are filled. Scheduling personnel from different squadrons in the
   same class is encouraged in order to efficiently use all ATS allocations. The ATS may
   accommodate less than full classes on a case-by-case basis when the class is needed to obtain
   mission ready status, e.g., pilot requalification.
   6.12.4. Remediation Scheduling. When a student is required to return to the ATS contractor
   for remediation of deficient areas or for mandated academic training sessions, the student's
   squadron will coordinate with the appropriate ATS contractor instructor supervisor to arrange
   a training date.
   6.12.5. Late or No-Shows. Course completion credit may be withheld in cases where
   student tardiness interferes with class training. For WST and CPT sessions, late is defined as
   15 minutes after mission briefing time. Classes that cannot be conducted without the late
   student's presence will be cancelled at the 30-minute point; e.g., a WST session that has a
   pilot no-show will be cancelled since the mission cannot be effectively conducted.
   6.12.6. Cancellations. Deletions from the ATS schedule will vary at each training site
   because of the training offered and the impact to scheduling. Deletions from the ATS
   schedule made prior to 1200 the duty day before class start are considered cancellations and
   will not be counted against student throughput. Deletions made after that time will be
   considered no-shows. Due to the impact of scheduling changes on PFT, FTU cancellations
   must be made not later than Wednesday of the week prior to class start.
   6.12.7. WST Wing Option / Government Use Time.
      6.12.7.1. The ATS contractor will provide a predetermined number of hours per month
      (cumulative on all devices), per site, for AMC use of the training equipment. An operator
      (not instructor) will be provided during this ―option‖ time.
      6.12.7.2. If an Air Force instructor is required, he should provide the operator with a
      lesson plan or outline prior to entering the device.
   6.12.8. Fill-Ins. Fill-in time will be made available for flight engineers in support of pilot
   courses and vice versa. The fill-in student can gain valuable experience and needed upgrade
   training during these periods. Mission profiles will be flown to support the scheduled
   training. Additional training/currency items may be accomplished as time and conditions
   permit.
   6.12.9. Unit WST Support. Units are required to provide pilot or FE support for WST
   courses when necessary. Unit training offices will establish procedures to determine when
   support is required and notify the appropriate personnel. If support is not provided, the
   course may be canceled.
6.13. Administration.
   6.13.1. Project Officers (PO) and Quality Assurance Representatives (QAR). Air Force-
   appointed ATS POs and QARs are primary focal points and the liaison agency between the
70                                                            AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


  Air Force and the ATS contractor. POs and QARs are the only Air Force personnel
  empowered to evaluate any component of contract compliance. These individuals are
  entrusted with quality assurance, are the only authorized office (unit-level) to direct
  contractor to perform or stop work via the contracting officer‘s direction, and are accountable
  for these actions. Each wing or group commander will establish ATS PO and QAR positions
  and enforce directives, requirements, and procedures established by DOD and MAJCOM
  directives and publications. ATS POs and QARs must maintain a current copy of the ATS
  contract, designated quality assurance regulations and directives, and quality assurance
  procedures.
  6.13.2. Summative Evaluation. AMC has established a requirement for the ATS contractor
  to evaluate on-the-job performance of the ATS program and its graduates. The objective of
  this on-going ―summative evaluation‖ is to ensure the ATS produces qualified graduates.
  The ATS contractor has established a system to ensure a steady flow of information to
  maintain the quality, effectiveness, and currency of ATS. Revisions to ATS will be based on
  this information.
  6.13.3. ATS Feedback. Feedback includes inputs from graduates, supervisors, and
  evaluators. Analysis of these data helps to determine if on-the-job performance of graduates
  meets MTL/ESD standards. The importance of this on-the-job performance feedback from
  graduates, supervisors, and evaluators cannot be overemphasized. The data are vital to
  establishing a database to identify trends and support revisions to the ATS.
  6.13.4. ATS Data Collection. Evaluator feedback questionnaires, post-training graduate
  questionnaires, and personal interviews are used to collect feedback data on the ATS. For
  more information regarding questionnaires and interviews, contact the local ATS contractor
  training manager.
     6.13.4.1. Evaluator feedback questionnaires (not applicable to FTU personnel).
     Complete one of these questionnaires for every flight evaluation, regardless of whether or
     not the examinee is a graduate of the ATS, and return to the ATS contractor.
     6.13.4.2. Post training graduate feedback questionnaire. The ATS contractor sends
     questionnaires to the graduate's supervisors within 2 months after the graduate has
     completed training. Squadrons must ensure questionnaires are distributed to the
     graduate's supervisors and time is made available to complete them. The supervisor will
     complete questionnaires and promptly return them to the ATS contractor.
     6.13.4.3. Personal Interviews. These interviews are used to obtain first hand information
     from graduates, supervisors, and evaluators on how well the ATS is performing. The
     ATS contractor will coordinate directly with the unit and provide the names of
     individuals selected for interviews. Date, time, and location will be selected so as not to
     interfere with either the unit's mission or the individual's schedule. The ATS contractor
     instructor or management personnel will conduct the interview.
  6.13.5. Training Forms. Use of ATS training forms is explained in each Air Force instructor
  flight training handbook and in applicable student guides.
  6.13.6. Notification of Evaluations. All ATS training folders will be returned to the ATS
  contractor complete with evaluation results and a completed evaluation feedback
AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012                                                                      71


   questionnaire, within 5 working days after the flight evaluation or unit certification. For off-
   station evaluations, use 5 working days after return to home station as a guide.
6.14. Browsing.
   6.14.1. Application. This paragraph applies to browser students using the CBT portion of
   the ATS.
   6.14.2. Procedures.
      6.14.2.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
      6.14.2.2. All browser requests are to be coordinated with the ATS contractor's
      scheduling section.
      6.14.2.3. Browsers may review all lessons.
      6.14.2.4. LM mission qualification students are not to be scheduled as browsers to
      review a lesson for remediation of deficient areas. Remediation for this will be scheduled
      by coordinating with the ATS contractor's LM supervisor.
6.15. Courseware Changes. Changes to ATS courseware, including the MTL/ESD, may be
proposed by any C-5 crewmember. Changes are submitted on the ATS contractor's quality
assurance change proposal (QACP) form. QACPs will be sent through operations group training
channels to Detachment 6 AMCAOS at Lackland AFB, Texas. Detachment 6 will coordinate
with the ATS contractor and originator, and provide feedback to reflect action taken. QACP
forms are available from the ATS contractor at each site.

1. Either high or low departures can be flown to meet the minimum requirement; however, at
least one each of the high and low departures should be flown during each semi-annual period.
2. Units with collocated simulators will accomplish these events in the WST only.
           7.12.1.1.6. If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie, credit may be taken
           after a second IP-supervised sortie, provided the combined activity fulfills the
           requirements of this paragraph. Instructors should tailor each proficiency sortie to the
           individual pilot's needs. Particular emphasis should be placed on simulated systems
           malfunctions, simulated-engine out operations, and instrument procedures. IPs will
           have individuals repeat maneuvers until proficient before crediting. IPs may credit a
           proficiency sortie after accomplishing all required events. If an M010 is accomplished
           in the WST, the students must be under the supervision of an IP or a qualified ATS
           contractor pilot instructor.
       7.12.1.2. Flight Engineers. All training and crew qualification levels will accomplish at
       least one proficiency sortie in the basic crew position every 60 days. To credit a sortie
       first FEs and higher must perform the required pre-departure activities FE panel duties
       and checklists for the mission flown. Second FEs will perform Scanner‘s duties and
       checklists for the mission flown. Note: Any flight profile will satisfy the sortie
       requirement, e.g., second half ERCC, quick turns, and full-stop landings.
       7.12.1.3. Loadmasters. Loadmasters must accomplish a preflight or through-flight
       inspection, inflight duties, and an onload or offload of either cargo or passengers.
       Loadmasters may credit proficiency sorties for each positioning and depositioning leg of
       a static load training mission where they accomplish a preflight or through-flight
       inspection, accomplish inflight duties, and participate in onload/offload training
       activities. Up to four loadmasters may credit a sortie during a heavy-weight AR training
       mission. Up to four may credit a sortie on a basic mission. Up to six loadmasters may
       credit a sortie for an SCTS mission. All training and crew qualification levels will
       accomplish at least one proficiency sortie in the basic crew position every 60 days.
   7.12.2. M011 FE Proficiency Sortie (Simulator). Simulator sorties that include a full
   mission profile (take-off, landing and all associated checklists) may update 60-day currency.
   Note: 60-day sortie currency may not be regained in the simulator. Do not credit consecutive
   60-day sorties in the simulator.
   7.12.3. M030 Overseas Sortie.
       7.12.3.1. Purpose: To keep crewmembers up to date with evolving ATC and 618 TACC
       procedures necessary for worldwide mobility tasking and ensure crews are proficient in
       oceanic crossing procedures.
       7.12.3.2. Description: To credit an overseas sortie, the pilot flying and pilot not flying
       must occupy primary crew positions during a takeoff (P020) or landing (P190) outside
       the 48 conterminous United States and review oceanic crossing procedures and overseas
       airspace. Airspace considerations (MNPS, RNAV/RNP, AP1/2/3/4, etc.) for the intended
       route of flight, emergency procedure planning, and weather avoidance will also be
       covered. Crew members performing instructor or evaluator duty may log this event
       provided appropriate airspace and oceanic procedures are instructed/evaluated during the
       sortie. OG/CC may elect to substitute a CONUS operational sortie when airlift
 88                                                             AFI11-2C-5V1 25 APRIL 2012


      requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for accomplishing the overseas
      sortie requirement. Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not permitted. In all
      cases aircrew members are still required to review airspace and oceanic crossing
      procedures based upon the frequency for M030 in Chapter 4.

                        AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training
Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025,
Aircrew Summary/Closeout Report, and aircrew training guides.
   A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4022) for ETCA formal training (either at FTU or
   in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit upgrade
   program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at FTU or in-
   unit), for any corrective action or additional training, and all training conducted on multiple
   flight/ground training periods on multiple days.
       A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
       corrective action or training is limited. If initiated for corrective action, the instructor or
       flight examiner who evaluated the aircrew member's performance will enter comments
       pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023. Use the existing AF Form 4022
       for end-of- evaluations that result in additional training.
       A2.1.1.2. At the unit's discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more than
       one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF
       Form 4022.
   A2.1.2. The FTU will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee's gaining
