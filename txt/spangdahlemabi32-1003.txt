2. Snow & Ice Control Concept.
   2.1. Concept.
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011                                                        11


  2.1.1. During the snow and ice season, Spangdahlem AB must ensure airfield, base roads,
  and A/C are kept cleared from snow and ice.
        2.1.1.1. Spangdahlem AB must conduct S&IC operations 24/7 to ensure airfield
        pavements are properly cleared in order to support both 52 FW and 726 AMS
        missions. The entire Spangdahlem community must be engaged in this effort in order
        to prevent lost sorties. This section describes specific actions individuals and
        organizations must conduct/implement during snow and ice conditio ns.
        2.1.1.2. Spangdahlem AB must conduct A/C deicing operations to ensure airlift A/C
        are properly cleared in order to support 726 AMS missions. The use of A/C deicing
        chemicals represents an increased load to the base storm water drainage and treatment
        system. To mitigate the release of contaminated water off-base in accordance with
        host nation water permits, it is crucial to control both deicing chemical usage and
        recovery.
        2.1.1.3. Spangdahlem AB is usually not required to conduct A/C deicing operations
        on 52 FW fighters A/C, due to the fact the 52 FW fighters are usually parked inside
        A/C shelters during the snow and ice season. Fighters A/C deicing will not be further
        detailed in the present instruction.
     2.1.2. 52 OSS/OSAM is the single point of contact for S&IC priorities on all airfield
     pavements and are the only agency authorized to give direction to the SCC or SNOW-1,
     other than the   52 FW/CC who can alter the priorities to 52 OSS/OSAM and/or MOC
     at any time.
        2.1.2.1. Further, all base agencies and tenants communicate their airfield pavement
        clearing requirements to 52 OSS/OSAM for incorporation into a single, consolidated
        priority listing.
        2.1.2.2. 52 OSS/OSAM communicates airfield pavement clearing priorities to the
        SCC for accomplishment.
        2.1.2.3. Any changes in priority or special clearing requests will be communicated by
        52 OSS/OSAM to the SCC via radio, snow control email inbox and/or telephone.
        2.1.2.4. SNOW-1 directs S&IC crews to clear airfield pavements of snow and ice
        IAW with 52 OSS/OSAM consolidated priority list.
        2.1.2.5. Upon clearing of airfield pavements, OSAM Ops will inspect the area to
        determine if acceptable and then communicate this to SCC. RCRs, when taken, will
        be reported to SCC and applicable agencies. Note : 52 OSS/OSAM is responsible for
        accepting/rejecting all airfield pavements except HAS hardstands and adjoining trees
        which are the Pro Super’s responsibility.
        2.1.2.6. The 52 MOS/MXOOM and the 726 AMS/MOC will notify 52 OSS/OSAM
        if an area is unacceptable based on the priority list. 52 OSS/OSAM will then advise
        the SCC of areas that need additional further attention.
        2.1.2.7. 52 OSS/OSAM keeps the SCC informed of pavement accep tance and the
        need of further S&IC actions.
12                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011


     2.1.3. Direction of S&IC crews and operations is the responsibility of 52 CES/CEOHP
     SCC and SNOW-1.
         2.1.3.1. S&IC personnel take direction from SNOW-1 only and will not be diverted
         by anyone for any reason except to stop an unsafe action.
         2.1.3.2. While the airfield is active the SCC and SNOW-1 will maintain radio contact
         with the control tower while conducting S&IC operations in controlled movement
         area (CMA). Outside of normal airfield flying hours, the SCC and SNOW-1will
         contact 52 FW/CP for control of the CMA.
         2.1.3.3. S&IC operations take priority over other users on a multiple- user radio net,
         unless otherwise directed by the control tower.
         2.1.3.4. The control tower will leave airfield lights on when requested by SNOW-1
         during S&IC operations. When the control tower is closed, runway and taxiway
         lighting support is conducted by 52 CES/CEOFE.
         2.1.3.5. SNOW-1 notifies 52 OSS/OSAM and the control tower of any unusual
         conditions caused by S&IC operations, to include potential and known hazards
         (windrows, snow banks, slush, etc.) on the runway. Note: This is especially critical
         when snow removal operations are interrupted for departing and arriving aircraft.
         2.1.3.6. The SCC will contact 52 OSS/OSAM after airfield pavement surfaces are
         cleared.
     2.1.4. 52 MOS/MXOOM will determine 52 FW aircraft pavement priorities and forward
     to 52 OSS/OSAM. 726 AMS Pro Super will determine aircraft pavement priorities and
     pass to MOC, 726 AMS/Air Terminal Operations Center will set mission cargo priority
     list, and 726 AMS/MOC will consolidate and forward to 52 OSS/OSAM. In add ition, 52
     MOS/MXOOM and 726 AMS/MOC will.
         2.1.4.1. Notify 52 OSS/OSAM of unaccepted surfaces NLT 2 hours prior to launch
         to allow SNOW-1 time to readdress the area.
     2.1.5. Direction of Aircraft Deicing Recovery crews and operations is the responsibility
     of 52 CES/CEOIU noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC)
  2.2. Airfield Pavement Clearing Procedures.
     2.2.1. Clearing priorities are established by 52 OSS/OSAM using the following mission
     priority listing.
         2.2.1.1. Emergencies.
         2.2.1.2. National Airborne Operations Center/Close Watch.
         2.2.1.3. Distinguished Visitors.
         2.2.1.4. Air Mobility Command (AMC) monitored missions (arrivals/departures).
         2.2.1.5. 52 FW assigned aircraft.
         2.2.1.6. Transient operations/possible diverts.
     2.2.2. The following clearing priorities are used unless otherwise directed by 52
     OSS/OSAM. (see Attachment 2)
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011                                                             13


         2.2.2.1. Priority 1 (red on the Snow Map).
                2.2.2.1.1. Runway and overruns.
                2.2.2.1.2. Primary taxiways: Alpha, Golf, Papa, and Echo.
                2.2.2.1.3. Access to Fire Station 3 on ramp 5.
         2.2.2.2. Priority 2 (yellow on the Snow Map).
                2.2.2.2.1. Secondary taxiways: Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Foxtrot and all trees in the
                HAS area.
                2.2.2.2.2. Aircraft arm and de-arm pads.
                2.2.2.2.3. All aircraft parking areas.
                2.2.2.2.4. Hot pit refueling areas.
     2.2.2.3.     Priority 3 (green on the Snow Map).
                2.2.2.3.1. All access roads on airfield.
                2.2.2.3.2. Personal Owned Vehicle/Government Owned Vehicle parking lots on
                airfield.
     2.2.3. Edge lights, in-pavement lights and runway distance markers will be kept
     uncovered at all times. Equipment operators must exercise caution to protect lights from
     damage while performing S&IC operations.
     2.2.4. The runway is cleared 75-feet from each side of the centerline at the start of each
     snowstorm. Once flying operations begin, further clearing is conducted in coordination
     with 52 OSS/OSAM.
     2.2.5. Parking ramps will not be cleared unless directed by 52 OSS/OSAM. 52
     MOS/MXOOM will request clearing of Ramps 1 – 4 and 726 AMS/MOC will
     consolidate and submit clearing requests for Ramps 5 & 6 and the 726 AMS cargo yard.
     2.2.6. The Instrument Landing System Glide Slope Near Field/Far Field Reflection
     Areas, the PAR Reflector Sail and Reference Reflectors do not require priority plowing
     or deicing unless snow accumulation reaches 18 inches or the glide slope signal is
     affected. If this occurs
         2.2.6.1. 52 CS Maintenance Control will request S&IC operational support through
         52 OSS/OSAM. S&IC Operations will only support on paved areas.
         2.2.6.2. 52 CS Metrological and Navigational Equipment and Radar Maintenance
         personnel will supervise S&IC operations in these areas.
     2.2.7. Unusual requirements (i.e. aircraft towing, Close Watch) requiring S&IC support
     are coordinated with 52 OSS/OSAM for proper prioritization.
     2.2.8. All snow piles taller than 24‖ within the aircraft movement area hinder safe
     aircraft operations and must be removed. Also, S&IC operations will remove snow
     accumulation for aircraft wing and engine clearance, and will determine the permissible
     snow tolerance beyond the aircraft movement area for the appropriate aircraft.
14                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011


     2.2.8.1. All precautions will be taken to ensure contaminated snow remains on the paved
     surface.
     2.2.9. Operating Techniques.
        2.2.9.1. The types and quantities of S&IC support equipment authorized for use at
        Spangdahlem AB depends on the operational status of the base and average mean
        snowfall spanning 10 years.
        2.2.9.2. S&IC techniques require the use of large capacity rotary snow blowers,
        runway sweepers and rollover plows operating at speeds in excess of 15 miles per
        hour. All personnel driving on or around airfield must be aware of this requirement
        and yield to S&IC equipment.
        2.2.9.3. Under heavy snowfall conditions, operations are concentrated on keeping the
        centerline portion of the active runway open. Wind velocity and direction usually
        determines the clearing pattern to be followed.
        2.2.9.4. In light-to- moderate snowfall conditions, the entire primary instrument
        runway is kept clear.
        2.2.9.5. To avoid accidents during low visibility conditions, S&IC operators must
        maintain a safe distance (at least 50 feet) between vehicles, especially while operating
        in a snow removal pattern. Equipment movement must be carefully timed and
        coordinated to ensure an orderly turn-around and a safe re-entry at the start of the
        return trip.
        2.2.9.6. Snow removal equipment will be inspected at least once per shift to identify
        breakage or loss of parts that could pose a FOD hazard to aircraft.
     2.2.10. Airfield Pavements Chemical Deicer.
        2.2.10.1. Deicing chemicals are applied to all airfield pavements at the discretion of
        SNOW-1 and are spread far enough across the pavement to allow safe travel for the
        largest aircraft utilizing the taxiway.
        2.2.10.2. SCC or SNOW-1 will notify 52 OSS/OSAM when chemical deicer is
        applied to any airfield pavement. 52 OSS/OSAM will send appropriate NOTAMs.
        2.2.10.3. Deicing chemicals are not applied on pavement which already satisfies the
        minimum RCR for safe launch and recovery of aircraft. The following are RCR for
        aircraft assigned and transiting through Spangdahlem AB. This is a guide for
        SNOW-1 to use when deicing chemicals need to be applied. For aircraft not listed,
        SNOW-1 will use the highest RCR listed, which is 12.

         2.2.10.4. 52 OSS/OSAM will send a NOTAM advisory of deicing chemical use on
         the airfield.
  2.3. Main Base Pavement Clearing Procedures.
     2.3.1. Simultaneously with operations on the airfield, S&IC operations for roads and
     other secondary areas on Spangdahlem AB and Bitburg Annex will be accomplished
     using established priority listings; any additional requests are coordinated through 52
     CES/CEO or the SCC.
         2.3.1.1. Priority 1 streets are emergency response vehicle routes (color coded red on
         snow map).
         2.3.1.2. Priority 2 are all other base streets (color coded yellow).
         2.3.1.3. Priority 3 are parking lots, sidewalks (color coded green).
              2.3.1.3.1. Main base parking area S&IC operations are accomplished at night,
              when possible.
              2.3.1.3.2. Sidewalks, areas outside of 100 feet of facilities and pedestrian
              walkways will be plowed and have salt applied by the SCC.
              2.3.1.3.3. S&IC operations within ten feet from around fire hydrants and hose
              reel compounds, building entrances, sidewalks, dumpster sites and loading ramps
              are accomplished by facility managers to allow for free/unimpeded access.
              2.3.1.3.4. Sidewalks and individual parking areas in family housing are cleared
              by the building custodians/occupants.
         2.3.1.4. Procedures for clearing snow from streets and roads vary with the amount of
         snow, equipment available and obstructions encountered.
  2.4. Aircraft Chemical Deicing Operations.
     2.4.1. Deicing chemicals applied to aircraft will be controlled by 726 AMS.
         2.4.1.1. Prior to deicing operations, 726 AMS personnel shall ensure all drains in the
         vicinity are covered and closed to prevent release of deicing fluids into the storm
         water collection system.
         2.4.1.2. Approximately one hour prior to aircraft deicing operations the MOC will
         contact 52 CES/CEOIU for dispatch of the GRV.
         2.4.1.3. Upon arrival of the GRV, deicing operations can begin using best practices
         that limit fluid use to the lowest possible levels without compromising flight safety.
         2.4.1.4. Aircraft deicing fluid use must be tracked and reported to the MOC by 726
         AMS.
 16                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011


          2.4.1.5. As each aircraft blocks out, the GRV will remove a majority of the dispensed
          fluid from the ramp.
   2.5. DICON Action Plan.
      2.5.1. 52 CES/CEOIU will assess current conditions and assign the DICON (green,
      yellow, red, or black), broadcasting it to the MOC daily (Attachment 3) and makes
      recommendations to 52 CES/CC.
      2.5.2. Using the DICON, 52 CES makes recommendations on aircraft deicing operation
      restrictions.
          2.5.2.1. If DICON Red, 52 CES/CC notifies the Deicing Czar, who then coordinates
          with 726 AMS/CC to take appropriate steps to reduce aircraft deicing operations.
          This includes limiting deicing operations to mission critical aircraft, requiring specific
          approval by tail number.
          2.5.2.2. If DICON Black, the Deicing Czar notifies 52 FW/CC, who then coordinates
          with 726 AMS/CC to cease aircraft deicing operations. Notification must be made to
          USAFE and AMC if DICON Black is assigned.
3. Snow & Ice Control Manning, Training, and Equipment/Facilities.
   3.1. Manning.
      3.1.1. Snow shifts will be postured on manpower availability to run 24 hours, 7-days a
      week from 15 November through 31 March in order to perform snow removal operations
      in a manner that is safe while still meeting mission requirements. Operator fatigue is a
      key concern. All shift personnel will ensure they receive 8 hours of rest prior to the start
      of their duty.
          3.1.1.1. If required, 52 CES augmentation is used to meet manning requirements.
          3.1.1.2. 52 CES/CC will identify required number of augmentees NLT 15
          September.
          3.1.1.3. Personnel shall be identified by name to 52 CES/CEOH NLT 30 September.
          3.1.1.4. Augmentees are required to attend a one-week training course each year in
          October.
          3.1.1.5. Augmentee personnel will report to and fall under SNOW-1 upon recall by
          the SCC. They remain under the control of SNOW-1 until S&IC operations are
          completed and the augmentees have been released by SNOW-1 back to their duty
          sections.
      3.1.2. Aircraft Deicing Recovery shifts will be postured on manpower availability to run
      7-days a week from 15 October through 15 April. Due to specific Air Force Specialty
      Code operations, Aircraft Deicing Recovery shifts will only be performed by 52
      CES/CEOIU personnel. No augmentees will be required.
   3.2. Training.
SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011                                                           17


     3.2.1. S&IC operations are inherently dangerous; training to ensure safe operations
     should include formal classroom lectures, training films, discussion periods and hands-on
     training such as:
        3.2.1.1. All vehicle operators must be trained in driving on the airfield and possess a
        flightline drivers license with CMA access.
        3.2.1.2. Identifying operator maintenance responsibilities, including fuel, fluid,
        supply locations, repair techniques and heavy equipment maintenance reporting and
        procedures.
        3.2.1.3. Hands-on training for all S&IC/GRV equipment. Perform practice runs with
        the equipment using typical operation scenarios. Substitute water for liquid deicers to
        reproduce realistic operations.

        are likely to occur. Conduct a night shift orientation with appropriate personnel.
        3.2.1.7. Inform personnel of duty location, duty hours, duty uniforms, shift schedules
        and notification procedures.
        3.2.1.8. During initial operator training and shop briefings, all personnel will perform
        a dry run on the active runway to be familiarized with the location of airfield markers,
        lights, barriers and other obstructions.
     3.2.2. Preparing the S&IC team.
        3.2.2.1. Duty sections must comply with all vehicle licensing and personal protective
        equipment policies. All equipment operators must meet minimum training hour
        requirements before licensing.
        3.2.2.2. Employ Snow Removal civilian over hires NLT 15 November of each year
        to leave time for their training and medical examinations.
        3.2.2.3. S&IC operations and working conditions are hazardous. Operators must be
        trained to:
            3.2.2.3.1. Anticipate hazards to equipment and attachments from hidden
            obstructions.
            3.2.2.3.2. Wear safety restraints at all times.
            3.2.2.3.3. Be aware of sleep deprivation and how to avoid falling asleep while
            operating S&IC equipment by 52 Aerospace Physiology (52 AMDS/SGPT) at
            DSN 452-6923.
  3.3. Equipment:
     3.3.1. Perform pre-season vehicle/equipment operational checks, including dry runs that
     resemble winter use as closely as possible.
        3.3.1.1. Ensure all equipment is mechanically sound and operational by 1 September.
        Identify equipment shortfalls to 52 CES/CEO.
18                                         SPANGDAHLEMABI32-1003 1 MARCH 2011


        3.3.1.2. Provide bi-weekly equipment status to 52 CES/CEO between 1 November
        and 1 May.
        3.3.1.3. Use heated storage facilities when possible to lengthen equipment life,

        3.3.1.4. Install and perform operational checks of all vehicle mounted, hand held and
        base station radios.
        3.3.1.5. Conduct daily run-up and operational checks of all equipment between
        15 November and 30 April.
        3.3.1.6. Properly adjust and calibrate all S&IC equipment attachments prior to S&IC
        operations.
        3.3.1.7. Equip each unit with required support materials such as tow cables, shovels,
        shear pins, ice scrapers and tool kits.
        3.3.1.8. Use wear-resistant tungsten carbide cutting edges to reduce maintenance.
        3.3.1.9. Replenish broom cores with poly bristles and spacers.
        3.3.1.10. Put vehicle call signs, base and airfield maps, spreader settings, operator
        manuals and snow removal priorities in each vehicle.
     3.3.2. Reviewing Runway Ice Detection System (RIDS).
        3.3.2.1. Four sensors embedded in the runway pavement measure surface conditions.
        These sensors measure pavement temperature, indicate presence of water or ice and
        provide information to allow the SCC to choose the most appropriate S&IC method.
        3.3.2.2. Air temperature is not an accurate gauge of pavement surface conditions.
        Many factors influence the formation of ice on pavements, including pavement
        temperature, surface color and composition, wind, humidity, solar radiation, traffic
        and residual deicing chemicals.
        3.3.2.3. Sensors are particularly valuable in timing anti- icing applications of
        chemicals. Ice formation can be predicted if the direction and rate of change of the
        pavement temperature is known. This information also aids in the determination of
        chemical application rate when ice or compacted snow has already accumulated on
        pavements.
        3.3.2.4. The RIDS (an annual contract) must be checked prior to the start of each
        snow season to ensure it is operational. Filters must be replaced and sensor pins
        cleaned.
     3.3.3. SCC.
        3.3.3.1. The SCC is equipped with a minimum of
           3.3.3.1.1. Two multi- line Class ―A‖ telephones for recalling S&IC personnel
           (452-6216, 452-6508).
           3.3.3.1.2. One radio transceiver or remote, using a dedicated net for S&IC
           communications when possible.
           3.3.3.1.3. Dispatch boards displaying vehicle registration numbers, nomenclature,

             3.3.3.1.4. Appropriate layout maps with color-coded priorities, status and runway
             surface conditions.
             3.3.3.1.5. Personnel rosters showing duty status and recall information.
             3.3.3.1.6. Charts identifying current weather conditions and forecasts.
             3.3.3.1.7. GEOBASE website snow removal portion. Updates airfield conditions
             during S&IC operations.
4. Post Snow & Ice Season Actions.
   4.1. S&ICWG members may review the SCC activity logs throughout the winter. At the end
   of the snow and ice season the S&ICWG members may incorporate any needed revisions
   into the S&ICP. They also prepare actions for the next snow and ice season.
      4.1.1. The 52 CES/CEOHP NCOIC is responsible for inspection, repair and storage of
      all S&IC equipment when the SCC is deactivated at the end of the snow and ice season.
      The NCOIC also:
          4.1.1.1. Identifies all required replacement parts and orders them immediately.
          4.1.1.2. Completes end-of-season activities such as storing snow fences and snow
          markers.
          4.1.1.3. Organizes and prepares the post-season snow briefing for the 52 FW/CC
          NLT 31 May.
      4.1.2. The 52 CES/CEOIU NCOIC is responsible for inspection, repair and storage of all
      A/C Deicing Recovery equipment at the end of the A/C deicing season. The NCOIC also
      identifies all required replacement parts and orders them immediately.
      4.1.3. The 52 LRS/Logistics Readiness Vehicle Maintenance provides a report on the
      status of snow removal vehicles and summer reb uild requirements.
      4.1.4. 52 CES/CEO inspects all pavement surfaces for damage which may have been
      caused by snow removal or A/C deicing recovery equipment. Survey other property for
      possible damage, such as airfield lighting, aircraft arresting s ystems, base signs, grounds
      and security fences. Notifies 52 OSS/OSAM of any damage found on the airfield.
