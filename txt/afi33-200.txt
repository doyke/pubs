                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. This AFI provides general direction for implementation of IA and
management of IA programs according to AFPD 33-2. Compliance ensures appropriate
measures are taken to ensure the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of Air Force ISs and
the information they process. Using appropriate levels of protection against threats and
vulnerabilities help prevent denial of service, corruption, compromise, fraud, waste, and abuse.
1.2. Applicability.
     1.2.1. Applies to all ISs owned, operated, or supported by the Air Force, including IS
     components of weapon systems, ISs that provide the management infrastructure and
     connections among other ISs, and networks that are used to process, store, display, transmit
     or protect DoD information, regardless of classification or sensitivity. This document is also
     binding on all users that operate, connect, or interact with information systems owned,
     maintained, and controlled by the DoD.
     1.2.2. More restrictive DoD and Intelligence Community directive requirements governing
     systems under the purview of the Intelligence Community take precedence over this
     instruction. For Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) systems, refer to Intelligence
     Community Directive (ICD) 503 and other Intelligence Community directives.
     1.2.3. More detailed implementation guidelines are contained in IA reference documents and
     specialized publications cited throughout this AFI.
1.3. Objectives. Adequate security of Air Force information and supporting information
technology (IT) assets is a fundamental management responsibility. The Air Force implements
and maintains the IA Program to adequately secure its information and IT assets. The objectives,
listed below, will be met through the effective employment of the Air Force’s core IA disciplines
of Communications Security (COMSEC), Computer Security (COMPUSEC), and Emissions
Security (EMSEC). The IA Program:
     1.3.1. Ensures Air Force ISs operate securely by protecting and maintaining the
     confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IS resources and information processed
     throughout the system's life cycle.
     1.3.2. Protects information commensurate with the level of risk and magnitude of harm
     resulting from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or modification.

                                           POLICY

Section 3A—Air Force IA Program

3.1. Air Force IA Program. The Air Force IA Program synchronizes and standardizes the IA
requirements of Air Force ISs through the following means:
   3.1.1. Integration of IA into all aspects of the Air Force Enterprise Architecture according to
   AFI 33-401.
   3.1.2. Coordination of IA projects across multiple investments through Lead Command
   management according to AFI 10-901.
   3.1.3. Improving the Air Force IT and National Security Systems (NSS) acquisition and
   fielding process through the IT Lean Process according to AFI 63-101 and AFI 33-210.
   Improvements are achieved in this streamlined process through appropriate oversight,
   standardized design and test, networthiness assessment, and fielding processes. The IT Lean
   Process aligns with the DIACAP required for all DoD-owned or controlled ISs that receive,
   process, store, display, or transmit DoD information. It does not alleviate the need to execute
   the DIACAP; however, the IT Lean Process and the integrated IA Controls in the Security,
   Interoperability, Supportability Sustainability, and Usability (SISSU) checklist can help the
   program team identify IA requirements. Refer to AFI 33-210 for complete policy and
   pointers to implementation procedures.
   3.1.4. Clear assignment of Air Force organizational and IT level IA roles and responsibilities
   are outlined via this instruction and supporting IA specialized publications.
   3.1.5. Development and management of a professional IA workforce according to the Air
   Force Information Assurance Certification Implementation Plan (will become AFSSI 8570).
3.2. IA Strategy. IA is traced, by SAF/A6N, as a programmatic entity in the Planning,
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution system with visibility extended into budget execution.
Air Force strategic IA goals and annual IA objectives are established (according to the DoD
Information Management Strategic Plan). Funding and progress toward those objectives are
tracked, reported, and validated through the Air Force IA Strategic Plan (upon approval of the
plan).
3.3. Air Force Specialized IA Publications. These publications document implementation of
Air Force IA policy objectives, under the authority of AFI 33-102, Communications and
Information Specialized Publications. These publications are numbered based upon the primary
subject groups cited below. Publication OPRs will regularly update or expand the content to
keep pace with new threats and manage any challenges associated with introduction of emerging
technologies.
   3.3.1. AFSSI 3000 Series – COMSEC Equipment.
   3.3.2. AFSSI 4000 Series – COMSEC Operations.
   3.3.3. AFSSI 7000 Series – EMSEC.
   3.3.4. AFSSI 8500 Series – IA Implementation.
AFI33-200 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                     21


   3.3.5. As described in AFI 33-102, the unclassified specialized publications will be hosted
   on the Air Force IA website (https://private.afca.af.mil/ip). The For Official Use Only
   (FOUO) specialized publications will be hosted on the Air Force IA Documentation (FOUO)
   Community                         of                       Practice                      (CoP)
   (Hhttps://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/ClosedCOP.asp?Filter=OO-SC-CA-11H).
   Classified specialized publications will be acquired from the office of primary responsibility.
3.4. IA Workforce. This instruction and supporting IA specialized publications standardize the
naming conventions and functions of Air Force organizational (management) and IT level
(technical or system-level) IA personnel. These documents also prescribe training and
certification requirements according to national and DoD policy consistent with and
supplementary to the guidance outlined in the Air Force Information Assurance Certification
Implementation Plan (will become AFSSI 8570).
3.5. IA Awareness. All authorized users of Air Force IT must maintain an understanding of Air
Force IA policies and procedures commensurate with their individual responsibilities. For a list
of these and other user responsibilities, reference AFI 33-100.
3.6. Network Defense (NetD). Reference the below guidance for NetD:
   3.6.1. AFPD 10-7, Information Operations, and subordinate AFIs govern Network Defense
   and INFOCON procedures.
   3.6.2. AFPD 13-3, Air Force Network Operations (AFNetOps), governs command and
   control of the AF-GIG.
3.7. IA Assessments. Designated Air Force (and DoD) activities will regularly and
systematically assess the IA posture of Air Force networks and ISs as well as IA services and
supporting infrastructures.
   3.7.1. Auditors perform audits according to Air Force Audit Agency guidance.
   3.7.2. Authorized activities perform host and network vulnerability or penetration testing
   according to guidance published by USAF/A3O-CN.
   3.7.3. ISOs and PMs comply with formal testing and certification activities according to AFI
   33-210.
   3.7.4. Performance measures and metrics will assess enterprise-wide (and individual
   elements where appropriate) IA performance and assess IA trends. The measurements and
   metrics will encompass, but are not limited to, federal and DoD IA reporting requirements.
   3.7.5. Information Assurance Assessment and Assistance Program. The IAAP is a staff
   function whose purpose is to ―find and fix‖ wing level IA problems. It is neither a function
   of, nor does it replace Inspector General or Air Force Audit Agency activities. The IAAP
   accomplishes ―staff assistance‖ by reviewing and assessing processes, identifying problems,
   providing assistance to help resolve the problems, and recommending solutions. The IAAP
   team provides technical and training assistance in all IA areas. The IAAP consists of two
   parts: assessment and assistance. IAAPs are performed according to AFI 33-230 (will
   become AFSSI 8560) through the review of areas itemized on AF Form 4160, Information
   Assurance Assessment and Assistance Program (IAAP) Criteria.
 22                                                          AFI33-200 23 DECEMBER 2008


3.8. Notice and Consent Certification. All Air Force installations, circuits, and ISs must
comply with DoD notice and consent certification requirements for monitoring to occur by
authorized activities. Comply with installation certification procedures found in AFI 33-219,
(Section C) (will become AFSSI 8561).
3.9. Connection Management. SAF/A6N provides Air Force representation to the Defense
Information Systems Network (DISN) Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG). The
DSAWG represents the DISN community and advises the DISN DAAs of likely community
acceptance or rejection of community risk. DISN connection decisions rest with the four DISN
DAAs. SAF/A6N will work with Air Force activities involved in the adjudication of conflicts
related to DISN connection decisions.
   3.9.1. Air Force activities adhere to the DISA Connection Approval Process if the system is
   connected to the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) or SIPRNet.
   Connection       Approval        Process     information      can      be     found      at
   http://iase.disa.mil/cap/index.html. For all Air Force ISs accessing the DISN-SIPRNet, get
   appropriate service (e.g., DISA) coordination and authorization before proceeding with
   combatant command coordination and/or Joint Staff approval.
   3.9.2. Air Force activities adhere to the guidance in AFI 33-210 for connection approval to
   the AF-GIG.
3.10. Configuration Management. The program manager (or designee) shall:
   3.10.1. Review all changes to the configuration of IT (i.e., the introduction of new IT,
   changes in the capability of existing IT, changes to the infrastructure, procedural changes, or
   changes in the authorized or privileged user base, etc.) for IA impact prior to implementation.
   3.10.2. Ensure interoperability and compatibility with existing Air Force standard IA
   policies and procedures according to the Air Force i-TRM (https://itrm.hq.af.milH).
3.11. IA Products. Reference AFI 33-210 for guidance on specified robustness of solutions and
product specification and evaluation requirements. Check the Air Force Evaluated/Approved
Products List (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/IAH) for recommended products and implementation
guidance, respectively.
3.12. Security Configuration and Implementation. IA reference documents, such as National
Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications, DISA Security Technical
Implementation Guides (STIG), and NSA Security Configuration Guides represent a collection
of resources for the secure configuration, implementation and deployment of IA- and IA-enabled
IT products that require use of the product's IA capabilities. Air Force specialized publications
(AFSSIs, Air Force Technical Orders, etc.) may supplement these documents and provide Air
Force specific implementation guidelines or guidance on the management of specific Air Force
IA programs. Apply these IA documents to establish and maintain a minimum baseline security
configuration and posture.
3.13. Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The KMI provides a common unified process
for the secure creation, distribution, and management of cryptographic products, such as
asymmetric keys (e.g., PKI) and traditional symmetric keys (e.g., Electronic Key Management
System) that enable security services for information systems. KMI-enabled services includes
access control and identification and authentication.
AFI33-200 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                         23


   3.13.1. PMs and IA professionals implement key management procedures according to AFI
   33-202, Volume 6 (will become AFSSI 8520) for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the
   appropriate AFSSI 3000- or 4000-series publication for specific cryptographic products.
   3.13.2. PMs and IA professionals implement Identification and Authentication (I&A) using
   the DoD PKI Class 3 certificate and hardware security token, when available, according to
   AFI 33-202, Volume 6 (will become AFSSI 8520).
3.14. Air Force IA Support Services. AFNIC supports the Air Force IA program through the
maintenance of the Air Force IA website, AF IA CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/IA (via the
AF portal: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/IA), Air Force portion of DIACAP Knowledge
Service, and traditional collaboration tools (i.e., electronic mail, the Air Force Portal, etc.) These
resources provide immediate access and awareness to current Air Force, DoD and federal IA and
IA-related policy and guidance, including recent and pending changes to Air Force policy and
Air Force/DoD IA controls.

Section 3B—Air Force Information System IA Program

3.15. Air Force Information System IA Program. IAMs (enclave or system-level) are
responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining the Air Force IS IA program.
   3.15.1. IAMs will ensure their IS IA programs integrate with the Air Force IA Program
   using the Air Force C&A program AFI 33-210. Tracking and reporting management review
   items will be accomplished using the information registered in Enterprise Information
   Technology Data Repository (EITDR).
   3.15.2. All elements of an Air Force IS IA program are developed, documented,
   implemented, and maintained through the Air Force C&A program. This program is the
   mechanism for coordinating IA requirements and capabilities between DoD and Air Force
   ISs, their supporting enclaves and the AF-GIG using a common baseline of standards
   referred to as IA Controls (see below). The Air Force C&A program includes guidance
   mandated by AFI 33-210 with implementation guidelines outlined by this instruction and
   specific procedure or program implementation through supporting specialized IA
   publications.
   3.15.3. The IAM implements their IA program with the assistance of IAOs (system-level), as
   required, and other privileged users (network administrators, system administrators, database
   administrators, web administrators, etc.)
3.16. IA Controls. System designation, Mission Assurance Category (MAC) and
confidentiality level (CL) establishment, as mandated by AFI 33-210, assist in the proper
determination and management of IA requirements. These IA requirements are primarily
expressed in the form of IA Controls. IA Controls, defined in detail within DoDI 8500.2,
provide a common management language for establishing IA needs or conditions. These
controls ensure systems are designed to meet those needs; implemented IA solutions are tested
and validated; changes to the validated baseline are managed; interconnections to other ISs are
coordinated; and provide a method for reporting IA readiness and posture. The baseline IA
Controls for each of the combinations of MAC and CL are outlined within the enclosures to
DoDI 8500.2.
 24                                                          AFI33-200 23 DECEMBER 2008


   3.16.1. PMs and/or IAMs identify and include DoD IA Controls in the design, acquisition,
   installation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all Air Force ISs. DOD IA Controls
   applicable to Air Force ISs must be addressed in all appropriate requirement documents.
   Additionally, DoD IA Controls are supplemented as follows:
       3.16.1.1. The Air Force establishes IA Controls that apply to ISs residing on or
       connecting to the AF-GIG, if necessary. Air Force IA controls must be applied to Air
       Force ISs; Guest ISs (formerly known as Non-Air Force ISs; reference AFI 33-210 are
       not required to implement Air Force component IA controls. The Air Force IA Controls
       do not contradict nor negate DoD baseline IA Controls. They add to or supplement DoD
       IA Controls with Air Force specific requirements, implementation guidelines or fill gaps
       between national and DoD level IA requirements. At no time will Air Force IA Controls
       degrade interoperability across both the GIG and AF-GIG. As with DoD IA Controls,
       Air Force IA Controls are uniquely named and formally catalogued. EITDR provides the
       reference for these Air Force IA Controls and also serves as the vehicle for measuring
       and reporting compliance throughout the life cycle of an IS. Air Force instructions and
       specialized publications provide implementation guidelines for Air Force IA Controls.
       The first option is to propose the control to the DoD for inclusion in the baseline. If DoD
       declines to add them to the baseline, the Air Force may develop augmented controls
       according to the process in AFI 33-210.
       3.16.1.2. Individual Air Force ISs may establish local, or augmented, IA Controls
       provided they are consistent with the paragraph above (3.16.1.1). Document these
       augmented controls through both the requirement and the C&A processes. If necessary,
       augmented controls provider a single system with additional protection from
       interconnected systems and address local threats or vulnerabilities. Local information
       system IA controls do not apply to other information systems and may not be used to
       deny connectivity of systems which meet baseline IA controls according to this
       instruction and AFI 33-210.
   3.16.2. PMs and/or IAMs coordinate Automated Information System (AIS) application-
   unique requirements for Joint and Defense-wide programs through the Air Force Authority to
   Connect process according to AFI 33-210. Coordination must occur through this process for
   connections to the AF-GIG rather than with local Air Force enclaves.
3.17. Information System Security Engineering (ISSE). IA will be integrated into the overall
system acquisition and engineering process throughout the entire system life cycle via the
information system security engineering (ISSE), according to DoDI 8500.2.
3.18. IT and IT Service Acquisitions. IA will be implemented in all IT and services
acquisitions (including space and non-space acquisitions) at levels appropriate to the system
characteristics and requirements throughout the acquisition life cycle, according to AFI 63-101
and AFI 33-210.
3.19. Communications Security. COMSEC refers to measures and controls taken to deny
unauthorized persons information derived from information systems of the United States
Government related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such ISs. COMSEC
protection results from applying security measures (i.e., crypto security, transmission security,
etc.) to communications and information systems generating, handling, storing, processing, or
using classified or sensitive government or government-derived information, the loss of which
AFI33-200 23 DECEMBER 2008                                                                       25


could adversely affect the national security interest. It also includes applying physical security
measures to COMSEC information or materials. Ensure all COMSEC activities comply with
