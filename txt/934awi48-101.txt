      934 AW WORKPLACE WRITTEN HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

A2.1. A copy of this workplace written program including AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication,
the Work Area Hazardous Chemical Inventory, and a list of the Non-Routine Tasks Involving
Hazardous Materials will be maintained at each work area.
A2.2. Safety Data Sheets (SDS).
     A2.2.1. 934 MSG/SGPB, Bioenvironmental Engineering/Public Health, building 752, 713-
     1608, 713-1609, 713-1610 and 713-1611, maintains the SDS master file containing all
     hazardous chemicals used at the 934th Airlift Wing. This master file consists of the
     Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS) and Safety Data Sheets.
     A2.2.2. Each workplace must maintain a SDS for each product listed on their Hazardous
     Chemical Inventory. Employees must know where the SDSs are kept and have ready access
     to them.
     A2.2.3. Supervisors will notify SGPB each time a new chemical is introduced into the work
     area. If a SDS for the product is not available in the base SDS master file, the organization
     must forward a copy to SGPB.
A2.3. Employee Information and Training.
     A2.3.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials
     receive training using guidance found in AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7. SGPB or other formal
     training organization (e.g., maintenance trainers) will train supervisors. Call SGPB for
     scheduling at 713-1608, 713-1609, 713-1610 or 713-1611.
     A2.3.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph
     2.7, “Employee Information and Training”.            This training may be provided by the
     supervisor, the organization occupational health coordinator, or other formal organization
     training structure (i.e., maintenance trainers). Supervisors should supplement this training to
     provide information on work area specific chemical hazards. Before presenting supplemental
     training, the supervisor will ensure appropriate agencies (i.e., SGPB 713-1608, Base
     Safety/SE 713-1236, Fire Safety/CEF 713-1923, Environmental Coordinator/CEV 713-1955)
     review the information for technical accuracy.
     A2.3.3. Ensure training is documented on the AF Form 55 or an equivalent product (e.g.
     AFFORMs, CAMs, CAS-B, GO81, MIS or AF ESOH-MIS) for initial hazard
     communication training, work place specific hazard communication training and new
     compound for the shop training.
     A2.3.4. Complete SGPB Revised OSHA Hazard Communication Training memorandum,
     Attachment 3, and send original to SGPB to be filed in the workplace industrial case file.
A2.4. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
     A2.4.1. The work area supervisor will develop the hazardous chemical inventory for his/her
     area. SGPB will review this inventory during the shop annual industrial hygiene surveillance
     survey.
934AWI48-101 10 APRIL 2014                                                                    5


   A2.4.2. Supervisors will maintain the inventory in the work area and update it as necessary.
   When new chemicals are introduced into the work area, the supervisor will add them to the
   inventory. Supervisors must send a copy of all new or updated SDSs to SGPB for inclusion
   in the base master SDS file. If the supervisor has SDSs of products no longer being used in
   the shop, send the shop SDS to SGPB with a note on them stating the products are no longer
   being used.
   A2.4.3. At a minimum, the inventory will include the identity of each hazardous chemical
   used in the work area as it appears on the SDS. However, proprietary information will not be
   included on the Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
A2.5. Contractor Operations.
   A2.5.1. The Contracting Officer (CO) LGC/713-1427, with assistance from SGPB/713-
   1608, and the work area supervisor, if requested, will advise contractors of hazardous
   chemicals they may encounter in the normal course of their work in the work area. The CO
   will inform the contractor that SDS information is available through SGPB and provide
   information on the labeling system.
   A2.5.2. At the pre-performance conference, and subsequently during the contract
   performance, the quality assurance evaluator or project officer will advise work area
   supervisors of hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required
   to submit information on the use of hazardous material according to FAR clause 52.223-3,
   Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.
   A2.5.3. The Contracting Officer will ensure that contractors provide SDSs for all hazardous
   chemicals brought onto this base. The Contracting Officer will forward these SDSs to SGPB
   for review.
A2.6. Non-routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   A2.6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       A2.6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed
       infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or cleaning
       up spills.
       A2.6.1.2. Temporary duties outside of an individual’s normal air force specialty code or
       job series.
   A2.6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in this work area
   which involve hazardous materials. The supervisor will ensure work area operating
   instructions thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls, for the
   infrequent tasks performed in this work area. Operating Instructions do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders or other official documents adequately describe these tasks.
   Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-routine
   tasks.
   A2.6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside of their normal jobs, the
   supervisor of the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
6                                                           934AWI48-101 10 APRIL 2014


    A2.6.3.1. The worker has had initial Hazard Communication training and training on the
    specific hazardous chemicals involved in the non-routine task.
       A2.6.3.2. Supplemental training on work area specific chemical hazards and associated
       controls as necessary.
       A2.6.3.3. The supervisor will record the Hazard Communication training on his/her AF
       Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record or an equivalent product (e.g. AFFORMs,
       CAMs, CAS-B, GO81, MIS or AF ESOH-MIS).
