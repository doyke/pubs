                                            Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This publication establishes guidance and procedures for identifying, analyzing,
and controlling health and safety risks from aquatic venues such as swimming pools, spas and
hot tubs, therapeutic pools, spray pads, and natural bathing areas on AF installations. These
procedures require collaboration among Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), Civil Engineer
(CE), Force Support Squadron (FSS), Public Health (PH), and Safety (SE). Many portions of
this instruction were taken from ANSI/APSP-11 2009 American National Standard for Water
Quality in Public Pools and Spas with permission from the Association of Pool & Spa
Professionals (APSP).
1.2. Safety and Health Risk. Swimming pools, spas and hot tubs, and natural bathing areas can
present multiple safety risks, such as drowning, slips and falls, and becoming caught in ladders,
ropes, or drains. In addition, these facilities present health risks, including those associated with
infectious disease, disinfection agents and their byproducts, and other contaminants which may
be transmitted to humans via the water.
     1.2.1. Infectious Diseases. Gastrointestinal Recreational Water Illnesses (RWI) are caused
     by the ingestion of water contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms including, but not
     limited to, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, E.coli, Shigella, and Norovirus.                  These
     microorganisms are spread in recreational water contaminated with fecal matter (e.g.,
     swimmers with diarrhea or small children with toileting accidents). Other RWIs may be
     respiratory (caused by inhaling water droplets containing organisms such as Legionella) or
     dermal (caused by organisms such as Pseudomonas.) The microorganisms listed above are
     examples only and do not represent a complete list. Public Health (PH) can determine if
     there are threats from other microorganisms, including those endemic to the local area.
     1.2.2. Other Contaminants. Non-microbial contaminants such as oils, lotions, leaves, and
     dirt are introduced by bathers. These can interfere with the clarity of the water, which
     increases the risk of injury due to poor visibility for swimmers. In addition, contaminants
     reduce the effectiveness of the sanitizer.
1.3. Regulatory Basis.
     1.3.1. Swimming Pools, Hot Tubs, and Spas. There are currently no federal regulations
     governing water quality in swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas. In the absence of federal
     authority and subsequent inapplicability of state and/or local regulations, this instruction
     outlines the minimum requirements that shall be met.
     1.3.2. Natural Bathing Areas. There are currently no federal regulations which prohibit
     swimming in natural bathing areas that exceed Clean Water Act water quality criteria. In the
     absence of federal authority, this instruction adopts the Environmental Protection Agency
     (EPA) criteria identified in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 131, Water
     Quality Standards, as the minimum water quality criteria. This instruction will apply the
     most recent updates to 40 CFR 131. Any subsequent updates to 40 CFR 131 water quality
     criteria will apply on the date of implementation.

     4.1. Swimming Pools, Hot Tubs, and Spas.
        4.1.1. Source Water. The pool treatment plant operator shall ensure the pool water comes
        from an approved drinking water source. (T-1)
        4.1.2. Chemical Operational Parameters. (Note: Definitions and discussion of the
        parameters mentioned here are provided in Attachment 6.)
            4.1.2.1. The pool treatment plant operator shall measure for those parameters indicated
            in Table 4.1 at intervals specified, making corrective actions to meet the guidelines or
            informing the facility manager of additional treatments recommended. (T-1)
            4.1.2.2. The outdoor recreation manager or lifeguard shall measure for those parameters
            indicated in Table 4.1 at intervals specified. pH, temperature, and disinfectant residual
            level of spas/hot tubs shall be measured prior to daily opening, and at all corners of the
            pool at least once every two hours during operation, entering the average of the values on
            the AF Form 708. If results are outside the acceptable range indicated in Table 4.1, close
            the pool and contact BE and the pool treatment plant operator. (T-1)
            4.1.2.3. Quality Assurance Check. At least once every 30 days during outdoor pool
            season, BE will perform a quality assurance check of the lifeguard’s pH and disinfectant
            residual measuring skills. BE will measure the pH and disinfectant residual levels, enter
            the results on the AF Form 708, and compare the results to the lifeguard's readings. If the
            readings differ significantly, BE shall determine the cause of the discrepancy and ensure
            the lifeguards are following the correct measurement procedures. BE shall increase the
            frequency of quality assurance checks if needed to ensure discrepancies are corrected.
            Measurements shall be made by lifeguard at times of heavy use. (T-1)
            4.1.2.4. Increased Risk Aquatic Venues. Water quality monitoring and chemical
            operational parameters for therapy pools, spray pads, and wading pools shall be the same
            as defined for swimming pools in Table 4.1.
            4.1.2.5. The Medical Group Commander may establish more stringent or specific
            monitoring requirements than outlined in this instruction.

*It is important to note the differences in FAC levels for responding to diarrheal vs. formed stool and
vomit incidents. A diarrheal incident has a higher risk of Cryptosporidium and requires a more robust
response, as described in Attachment 6.
      4.1.3. Test Kits. Water quality test kits shall be stored as specified by the manufacturer’s
      instructions. Improper storage can cause the kits to function improperly. (T-1)
      4.1.4. Hyperchlorination.
            4.1.4.1. The pool treatment plant operator shall super chlorinate the pool as necessary to
            correct poor water quality.
            4.1.4.2. The pool treatment operator shall annotate each shock treatment on AF Form
            708.
            4.1.4.3. The contact time (CT) inactivation values indicate the approximate disinfection
            time required to inactivate specific microorganisms. CT values are defined as the
            concentration of free chlorine in ppm multiplied by time in minutes at a specific pH and
            temperature. See Table 4.2 for a list of CT inactivation values sufficient to inactivate
            some microorganisms commonly found in pool/spa water. Other CT values may be used
            as long as they are consistent with 40 CFR 141.74. For sanitizers other than chlorine,
            follow manufacturer’s guidelines. Cryptosporidium is a chlorine-resistant microorganism,
            and the recommendations provided by the CDC fact sheet “Hyperchlorination to Kill
            Cryptosporidium” shall be reviewed prior to any hyperchlorination intended to inactivate
            it. (T-1)

                Note: These values are only for pools that do not use a chlorine
                stabilizer such as CYA. Disinfection times would be longer in the
                presence of a stabilizer.
4.2. Natural Bathing Areas.
   4.2.1. Risk-Based Sampling. BE shall perform water quality sampling at natural bathing
   areas based on risk. Risk factors to consider include, but are not limited to, proximity to
   suspected pollution sources, level of bathing area use, historical water quality data, and
   occurrence of sewage spills or other pollution events. If local or state regulatory agencies
   have current data, those data may be used and BE can determine what, if any, additional
   parameters need to be evaluated. If BE decides not to sample at natural bathing areas, the
   rationale behind the decision shall be documented. This documentation must be reviewed
   and updated at least annually. (T-2)
   4.2.2. Sampling Methods. If bacteriological sampling is conducted, refer to 40 CFR 131.41
   for guidance. E.coli and Enterococci shall be used as the indicator organisms for evaluating
   the microbiological suitability of the water in freshwater natural bathing areas. Enterococci
   shall be used as the indicator organism in marine waters, and Enterolert® or any equivalent
   method that measures viable criteria, as indicated in 40 CFR 136 shall be used. For E.coli,
   Colilert® or any equivalent method that measures viable criteria, as indicated in 40 CFR part
   136 shall be used.      All sampling shall follow guidance in Standard Methods for the
   Examination of Water and Wastewater, current edition. The use of certified laboratories for
   bacteriological analyses is not required if BE adheres to Standard Methods. (T-0; 40 CFR
   131)
   4.2.3. Additional Sampling. If a bacterial concentration exceeds the applicable water
   quality standard identified in 40 CFR 131.41, or a storm, sewage spill, or pollution event
   occurs that could affect the natural bathing area, additional sampling shall be conducted. (T-
   1)
4.3. Bacteriological Monitoring. BE will provide bacteriological monitoring only in support of
specific requests attributable to disease outbreaks. (T-1) If bacteriological water quality of pools,
spas/hot tubs, or natural bathing areas does not meet standards, BE shall:
   4.3.1. Collect repeat samples from the points of previous collection. (T-1)
   4.3.2. Conduct an immediate investigation to determine if any unusual conditions such as
   repairs to facilities, storms, spills, etc. might have caused a problem. For pools and spas/hot

    tubs, CE shall determine if the filtration and disinfection systems have been operating
    properly. (T-1)
    4.3.3. Ensure pH and disinfectant residuals are within acceptable ranges for pools and
    spas/hot tubs. (T-1)
    4.3.4. Notify PH whenever conditions are encountered which may pose a health hazard to
    patrons. (T-1)
    4.3.5. If the results of the resample again exceed standards, shock treatment of pools and
    spas/hot tubs may be required. (T-1) the Medical Group Commander or designated
    representative shall recommend closing the facility until the cause of the problem is
    determined.
    4.3.6. PH shall take any measures deemed necessary to initiate surveillance or investigate
    the occurrence of illnesses associated with unhealthy water quality. (T-1)
                                                                  1
4.4. Responding to a Fecal, Vomit, or Blood Incident.
    4.4.1. Recordkeeping. Outdoor recreation managers shall document each incident by
    recording date and time of the event, whether it involved vomit, blood, formed stool or
    diarrhea, and the free chlorine and pH levels at the time of observation of the event. Before
    reopening the pool, record the free chlorine and pH levels, the procedures followed in
    response to the incident (including the process used to increase chlorine levels if necessary),
    and the contact time. (T-1)
    4.4.2. Pool Closure. In the case of a fecal or vomit incident, close the pool or spa until the
    disinfection process has been completed in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) guidelines in Attachment 7. (T-1)
    4.4.3. Water Treatment. In the case of a fecal or vomit incident, the FAC level in the
    pool/spa water shall be raised to the appropriate level and maintained for the appropriate
    contact time (CT). Specific procedures for the type of incident are in Attachment 6. (T-1)
    4.4.4. Blood Incident. The chlorine in properly chlorinated pool water quickly kills
    microorganisms in blood. There is no public health reason to close the pool after a blood
    spill; however pool staff may choose to do so for aesthetic reasons to satisfy patrons.

                      REVIEWING BATHING FACILITY DESIGNS

A2.1. Consider:
   A2.1.1. Drains sized to prevent entrapment and avoid suction injuries.
   A2.1.2. Circulation equipment sized to ensure the proper turnover rate as described in
   paragraph A6.2
   A2.1.3. Filters sized to accommodate proper turnover rate.
   A2.1.4. Pool sized to accommodate expected bather load. The bather load is calculated as
   one bather per 15 square feet of surface area in portions of the pool that are 5 feet deep or
   less (shallow end), and one bather per 20 square feet of surface area in portions of the pool
   that are more than 5 feet deep (deep end). Subtract 300 square feet from the total surface area
   of the deep end for each diving board.
   A2.1.5. For increased risk aquatic venues such as spray pads, wading pools, and therapy
   pools: supplemental, optimally-designed in-line disinfection, e.g., ozone or UV light, which
   can inactivate Cryptosporidium and potentially improve water quality.
   A2.1.6. Automatic chemical feeders to improve the uniformity of chemical addition.
   A2.1.7. Filters that are sized and optimized for particle and microbe removal.
   A2.1.8. Dedicated filters for wading pools/baby pools, to prevent cross-contamination of
   other pools.
   A2.1.9. Wading pool/baby pool turnover rates that decrease the length of time swimmers are
   exposed to germs and include safety considerations for avoiding drain entrapment and
   suction injuries.
   A2.1.10. Adequate ventilation for indoor facilities to decrease exposure to chloramines and
   other pool-water byproducts. See American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air
   Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air
   Quality and 2011 ASHRAE Handbook HVAC Applications for guidance. The latter
   document has specific design information regarding indoor pools, also known as natatoriums.
   AF personnel can download these publications from the online Whole Building Design
   Guide, at http://www.wbdg.org.
   A2.1.11. Adequate numbers of easily located, close, and safe restrooms, diaper changing
   areas, and shower facilities to promote good swimmer hygiene. See Unified Facilities
   Criteria 3-420-01: Plumbing Systems, Table 403-5 for guidance. AF personnel can

          CONSIDERATIONS FOR SITING OF NATURAL BATHING AREAS

A4.1. Site Location. Consider effects of point and nonpoint pollution sources. Sources of
potentially dangerous contamination include (but are not limited to) waste discharges from
communities, agriculture, industries, marine craft, local animal populations, and water fowl.
A4.2. Type of Bottom. These areas should have floors which slope gently and uniformly
toward deep water; have no holes or sudden step-offs; be free of hidden or submerged
obstructions such as rocks, stumps, snags, and sunken logs; be composed of firm sand, small-
sized gravel, or shale; have no silt, quicksand, shell patches, sharp and broken rock, or debris in
depths of 5 ft (1.5 m) or less.
A4.3. Physical Water Quality. Consider the depth and turbidity of the water, presence of
currents, rip tides, and dangerous aquatic flora and fauna.
A4.4. Common Diseases. Natural bodies of water located in areas where schistosomiasis
(bilharziasis), leptospirosis, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis are endemic shall not be
approved for recreational purposes without the concurrence of the public health or preventive
medicine officer. PH shall be consulted to determine if there are threats from other
microorganisms, including those endemic to the local area.

            TYPES OF SWIMMING POOL, SPA AND HOT TUB TREATMENT2

A5.1. Background. Many chemical substances sold or distributed in the United States must be
registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This includes disinfectants and
sanitizers such as chlorine and bromine used in swimming pools and spas. (It is important to
note that an EPA-registered sanitizer does not kill all bacteria in the pools or spas, but controls
them and reduces their opportunity to spread disease.) A measurable amount, known as a
“residual,” of an EPA-registered sanitizer shall be present at all times and in all areas of the
swimming pool or spa. Any system used shall incorporate an EPA-registered sanitizer. Follow
the product manufacturer’s EPA-accepted label for use and/or operation requirements.
A5.2. Sanitizers. Sanitizers currently approved for use by the EPA are chlorine, bromine,
polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), and silver-based systems. However, chlorine and
bromine are the most commonly used.
      A5.2.1. Chlorine. Chlorine is the most common sanitizer used in pool and spa treatment. In
      this method, chlorine in a liquid, powder, tablet, or gas form is added to the pool water.
      Chlorine generators are an alternative method of chlorination. Instead of adding chlorine
      directly, chlorine generators use salt (NaCl) brine in an electrolytic cell to produce chlorine
      in the pool. Chlorine reacts with the pool water to form hypochlorite (OCl -) and
      hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which kills pathogens. Combined chlorine, also known as
      chloramines, can form when free chlorine reacts with amine-containing compounds (proteins
      and ammonia from perspiration and urine). These compounds can cause eye, mucous
      membrane, and skin irritation and have strong objectionable odors. Chlorine tends to
      degrade in sunlight. A stabilizer such as cyanuric acid may be used to counteract this
      degradation.
         A5.2.1.1. Cyanuric acid (CYA). Cyanuric acid is available as either CYA or as
         chlorinated isocyanurate. CYA stabilizes chlorine by loosely binding to chlorine and
         thus inhibiting degradation by UV in sunlight. However, binding with chlorine decreases
         the disinfectant effectiveness. At CYA concentrations in the range of 100-200 ppm,
         binding results in a condition termed “chlorine lock” in which disinfection is ineffective.
         CYA does not degrade. Hence, the pool must be overflowed or partially drained and
         refilled in order to reduce CYA concentrations. The optimum concentration for CYA is
         25-50 ppm. Use of CYA in indoor pools or with bromine disinfectant is prohibited.
      A5.2.2. Bromine. If bromide salt is used, an oxidizer (such as HOCl) is required for the
      conversion of bromide to hypobromous acid (HOBr). Bromochlorodimethylhydantoin
      (BCDMH) is an alternate method for generating HOBr. BCDMH generates both HOCl and
      HOBr. The HOCl is consumed first, leaving HOBr as the disinfectant. Bromine is effective
      over a wider pH range than chlorine, but cannot be stabilized against degradation by sunlight
      (CYA cannot be used with bromine). In the same way that chlorination can result in
      chloramines, bromination can result in byproducts called bromamines.               However,
      bromamines are not known to be harmful at concentrations normally found at swimming

    pools, spas, and hot tubs. Of note, a pool disinfected with bromine cannot be converted to
    chlorine disinfection without draining and refilling.
    A5.2.3. Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). PHMB is an effective pool and spa
    sanitizer. Its advantages include minimal degradation in sunlight and low eye and skin
    irritation. Its disadvantages are high costs, the need for additive chemicals as algicides, and
    lack of understanding of compatibility with other pool chemicals (for example, chlorine
    degrades PHMB). Because of these disadvantages, PHMB is not recommended for AF
    owned or operated pools and spas.
    A5.2.4. Supplemental sanitizers. Ozone and ultraviolet (UV) light are types of
    supplemental (optional) sanitizers. A benefit of systems that use supplemental sanitizers is
    that they use less chlorine than chlorination alone. In addition, supplemental sanitizers are
    especially effective against some chlorine-resistant microorganisms, such as
    Cryptosporidium and Giardia. However, these supplemental sanitizers do not provide a
    lasting disinfectant effect or residual that reaches the pool and continues to act upon
    chemicals and microorganisms in the water. Because of this, they are not adequate for stand-
    alone uses.
        A5.2.4.1. Ozone. Ozone is generated onsite at the point of use. When ozone is used for
        indoor facilities, air monitoring may be required within the enclosed swimming pool area.
        For installations using ozone, coordinate with USAFSAM for guidance on the need for
        air monitoring and appropriate occupational and environmental exposure limits. (There
        is limited research discussing the hazard of ozone in indoor swimming pools.)
        A5.2.4.2. UV. UV light can be used for disinfection but the pool water shall be treated
        beforehand to meet manufacturer’s recommendations (including filtration) for the color,
        turbidity, particulate size and chemical composition.         Note:     UV degrades
        hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid to chloride ion (bromine to bromide) and thus interferes
        with maintaining disinfectant residuals.
        A5.2.4.3. Silver-based sanitizers. Silver is used as an antibacterial agent in many
        applications, including swimming pool sanitizers. Positively charged silver ions attach to
        negatively charged contaminants and destroy them. On AF installations, silver shall not
        be used as a primary sanitizer but may be used as a supplemental sanitizer.
A5.3. Filters. 3 Filters are not designed to remove bacteria, but are designed to improve clarity
of pool water. Water clarity is important to identify swimmers in distress, and so swimmers can
see potential underwater hazards. In addition, particulates negatively interfere with the
disinfection process. Filters shall be sized to accommodate the appropriate pool turnover rate as
described in paragraph A6.2 There are a number of types of filters available. The choice of
filter will be based on several factors, including quality of source water; amount of filter area
available and number of filters; filtration rate; ease of operation; method of backwashing; and
degree of operator training required. Typically the higher the filtration rate, the lower the
filtration efficiency.
    A5.3.1. Cartridge filters. Cartridge filters can nominally filter down to 10-20 microns and
    last up to two years. The filter medium is spun-bound polyester or treated paper. Cleaning is

  achieved by removing the cartridge and washing it. The main advantage is the relatively
  small space requirement compared with other filter types, and they are often used with small
  pools and hot tubs.
  A5.3.2. Sand filters. Medium-rate sand filters can nominally filter down to 30 microns in
  size with the addition of a suitable coagulant. A coagulant is needed for a sand filter to
  perform optimally. To clean sand filters, pool operators perform manual reverse flow
  backwashing.
  A5.3.3. Diatomaceous earth filters. These filters use replaceable diatomaceous earth filter
  medium added after each backwash. Diatomaceous earth filters particles 3-5 microns and
  has been reported to filter 99.9% of Cryptosporidium when operated and maintained
  correctly. Discharge of chlorinated water or filters containing chlorinated water may be
  prohibited by local state or city ordinances. Verify local and state requirements prior to
  discharge or disposal.

A6.1. Chemical Operational Parameters.
    A6.1.1. FAC. Free available chlorine (FAC) is the indicator used to measure the level of
    sanitizer residual for chlorination systems. For swimming pools, a minimum FAC residual
    of 1.0 ppm shall be maintained at all times and in all areas of the pool. A maximum of 4.0
    ppm shall not be exceeded when the pool is open to swimmers. For spas and hot tubs, the
    FAC shall be between 2.0 – 5.0 ppm. Chlorine disinfectants will dissipate quicker than
    bromine and mineral stabilizers in the higher temperatures of spas and hot tubs. Table 4.2
    shows the amount of time, known as the inactivation time, required to control the organisms
    of interest in recreational waters with 1.0 ppm free chlorine residual.
    A6.1.2. Bromine. If bromine is used, a minimum residual of 1.0 ppm (as Br2) shall be
    maintained at all times and in all areas of the pool. A maximum of 8.0 ppm (as Br2) shall not
    be exceeded when the pool is open. For spas, the bromine residual shall be between 2.0 – 8.0
    ppm. If a chlorine DPD test kit is used to measure bromine, the FAC reading shall be
    multiplied by 2.25 to obtain the bromine concentration.
    A6.1.3. Ozone. If an ozone supplemental sanitizer is used, especially for an indoor pool, air
    monitoring may be required (see paragraph A5.2.4.1). In addition, CE shall periodically
    leak check for gaseous ozone at the ozone generator.
    A6.1.4. pH. pH shall be maintained within a range of 7.2 – 7.8 to ensure optimal
    performance of the sanitizer. If the pH is higher than this range, the HOCl concentration will
    not be high enough to adequately sanitize. If the pH is below this range, chlorine gas could
    form which is a health hazard to swimmers, and also wastes chlorine that could be used in the
    pool.
    A6.1.5. Total alkalinity. Alkalinity is the measure of the ability of water to resist a pH
    change, known as the buffering capacity. A total alkalinity of 60 ppm – 180 ppm shall be
    maintained.
    A6.1.6. Calcium hardness. Calcium concentration shall be kept below the maximum to
    avoid production of scale and cloudy water. Maintain a calcium (or Langelier) saturation
    index between -0.3 and +0.5. The acceptable range for pool water is 150 ppm – 1,000 ppm
    as CaCO3, and ideally between 200 ppm – 400 ppm. The acceptable range for hot tub/spa
    water is 100 ppm – 800 ppm as CaCO3, and ideally between 150 ppm – 250 ppm.
    A6.1.7. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). TDS is a measure of all the dissolved ions in the
    water. TDS can decrease efficacy of sanitizers and cause water to become cloudy or hazy.
    The TDS level in pool/spa shall not exceed 1,500 ppm above the TDS level of pool startup
    concentration.
    A6.1.8. Clarity. Water clarity is important to identify swimmers in distress, and so that
    swimmers can see potential underwater hazards. In addition, particulates can negatively

  interfere with the disinfection process. Clarity is measured by using a Secchi disk, as
  described in Table 4.1
  A6.1.9. Cyanuric Acid. CYA, if used, shall be maintained between 25-50 ppm. 100 ppm is
  the maximum allowable. Use of stabilized chlorine products (e.g. di-chlor or tri-chlor) in an
  erosion feeder will eventually lead to exceeding approved levels. If using a chlorinated
  isocyanurate to maintain FAC, CYA levels shall be checked weekly. Only qualified
  personnel use stabilized chlorine tablets and monitor CYA levels within recommended limits
  to reduce chlorine loss in outdoor pools. Tablets of dichlor and trichlor are chlorinated
  isocyanurates solid compounds that contribute CYA to pool water to reduce the loss of free
  chlorine by the sun’s ultraviolet rays. However, excessive CYA can reduce the effectiveness
  of chlorine with some species of pathogens. CYA should not be used in hot tubs or spas
  because chlorine effectiveness is significantly weakened in the presence of CYA.
  A6.1.10. Oxidation reduction potential (ORP). The oxidation–reduction potential (also
  known as ORP or redox) can also be used in the operational monitoring of disinfection
  efficacy. ORP measures the effectiveness of disinfectant in the swimming pool water by
  providing an indication of the capacity of the disinfectant to oxidize or sanitize organic
  contaminants. ORP is measured in units of millivolts (mV) with a handheld meter. The ORP
  value corresponds to an approximate level of oxidizing sanitizer such as chlorine or bromine.
  In general terms for swimming pools and similar environments, levels in excess of 720 mV
  (measured using a silver/silver chloride electrode) or 680 mV (using a calomel electrode)
  suggest the water is in good microbial condition. However, measuring ORP does not
  eliminate the need for testing sanitizer levels with standard test kits. Installations operating
  an ORP system should consult manufacturer documentation to investigate whether the
  system can reach the acceptable range for FAC.
  A6.1.11. Temperature. The temperature of hot tub/spa water must never exceed 104°F.
  A6.1.12. Bacteria. Because the deterioration of water conditions is difficult to measure
  through regular monitoring, water quality parameters must be maintained in accordance with
  this instruction. This will ensure safe quality water while avoiding the expense of
  unnecessary continuous bacteriological sampling.
  A6.1.13. Algae. Algae can affect the health and safety of swimmers by harboring disease-
  causing organisms, causing slippery pool floors, and raising the turbidity in a pool. Algae
  can be very difficult to eliminate once it gets established in a pool. Maintaining proper
  sanitizer levels is the best method of prevention. There is no requirement to perform testing
  for algae, but if it is observed, immediate action shall be taken to remove it.
  A6.1.14. Combined chlorine. Combined chlorine, also known as chloramines, can form
  when free chlorine reacts with amine-containing compounds, e.g., proteins and ammonia
  from perspiration and urine. These compounds can cause eye, mucous membrane, and skin
  irritation and have strong objectionable chlorine-type odors.       Combined chlorine
  concentrations are obtained by subtracting the measured FAC from the measured total
  chlorine concentration. The maximum level for combined chlorine is 0.2 ppm in pools and
  0.5 ppm in spas.
  A6.1.15. Water Replacement. Many contaminants enter pool and spa water from the
  environment, from the bathers themselves, and from byproducts of chemicals used to treat
AFI48-114 27 OCTOBER 2014                                                                                   27


    the water. Although filtration and oxidation are effective in removing many of these
    contaminants, many of them remain and accumulate in the water. In pools and spas, water
    replacement is generally the only practical way to correct for excessive contaminants,
    calcium hardness, TDS, and CYA. Water replacement can be accomplished by periodic
    draining or continuous dilution; however, continuous dilution does not preclude the need for
    periodic draining and thorough cleaning of the pool or spa.
        A6.1.15.1. Monitoring. Measure the TDS concentration in pools, spas, and hot tubs
        every two weeks. When the TDS concentration exceeds the startup concentration by
        1,500 ppm or more, partially drain and refill the pool to reduce it to acceptable levels.
A6.2. Turnover Rate.
    A6.2.1. The turnover rate is the time taken for all of the water in a pool to be circulated
    through the pump/filter system. The turnover rate is calculated by the following formula:
Turnover rate (hours) = Pool volume (gal) ÷ Flow rate (gal/min) ÷ 60 (min/hour)
To determine the flow rate required to achieve a turnover rate of 6 hours, use the following
formula:
Flow rate (gal/min) = Pool volume (gal) ÷ 360 min
Turnover rate shall not exceed 6 hours, or 360 minutes.
    A6.2.2. The turnover rate for wading pools/baby pools shall be one hour.

solutions.5

                   RESPONSE TO FECAL, AND VOMIT, INCIDENTS6

A7.1. Formed Stool and Vomit Incidents. Close the pool to swimmers and notify Public
Health. In cases of multiple pools that use the same filtration system – all pools will have to be
closed to swimmers. Do not allow anyone to enter the pool(s) until the disinfection process is
completed.
    A7.1.1. Remove as much of the fecal matter or vomit as possible (for example, using a net or
    a bucket) and dispose of it in a sanitary manner. Clean and disinfect the items used to
    remove the fecal matter or vomit (for example, after cleaning, leave the net or bucket
    immersed in the pool during disinfection.)
    A7.1.2. Do not vacuum stool or vomit from the pool.
    A7.1.3. Raise the free chlorine to 2 ppm, if less than 2 ppm, and ensure pH 7.5 or less and a
    temperature of 77°F or higher. This chlorine concentration will keep the pool closure time to
    30 minutes. It is important to note this procedure applies only to formed stool and vomit
    incidents, because these types of incidents carry a low risk of Cryptosporidium . However, a
    diarrheal incident has a higher risk of Cryptosporidium and requires a more robust response,
    as described in paragraph “Diarrheal Incidents” below.
    A7.1.4. Other concentrations or closure times can be used as long as the CT inactivation
    value is achieved (see paragraph 4.1.4.3 for a discussion of CT values). Please note, a longer
    CT is needed if a chlorine stabilizer (CYA) is used.
    A7.1.5. Maintain free chlorine concentration at 2 ppm and pH 7.5 or less for at least 30
    minutes before re-opening the pool. Ensure the filtration system is operating while the pool
    reaches and maintains the proper free chlorine concentration during the disinfection process.
A7.2. Diarrheal Incidents. Close the pool to swimmers for the remainder of the day and notify
Public Health. If you have multiple pools that use the same filtration system – all pools will
have to be closed to swimmers. Do not allow anyone to enter the pool(s) until the next business
day.
    A7.2.1. Remove as much of the fecal matter as possible (for example, using a net or a
    bucket) and dispose of it in a sanitary manner. Clean and disinfect the items used to remove
    the fecal matter (for example, after cleaning, leave the net or bucket immersed in the pool
    during disinfection.)
    A7.2.2. Do not vacuum stool from the pool.
    A7.2.3. Before attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool, consult CE and/or BE to
    determine the feasibility, the most optimal and practical methods, and needed safety
    considerations.

  A7.2.4. Raise the free chlorine concentration to 20 ppm and maintain pH 7.5 or less and a
  temperature at 77°F or higher. The free chlorine and pH shall remain at these levels for at
  least 12.75 hours to achieve the CT inactivation value of 15,300.
  A7.2.5. Confirm that the filtration system is operating while the water reaches, and is
  maintained, at the proper chlorine level for disinfection.
  A7.2.6. Backwash the filter after reaching the CT inactivation value. Be sure the effluent is
  discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or local regulations. Do not return
  the backwash through the filter. Where appropriate, (e.g., if using cartridge or diatomaceous
  earth filters) replace the filter media.
  A7.2.7. Swimmers shall not be allowed into the pool until the next business day after a
  diarrheal incident. Notify Public Health before re-opening the pool, and ensure the required
  CT inactivation value has been achieved and the free chlorine and pH levels have been
  returned to the normal operating range.
