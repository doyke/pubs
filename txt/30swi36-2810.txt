                     RECOGNITION BOARD MEMBER GUIDANCE

A5.1. General Information. Your duties and responsibilities in the recognition process require
that you make wise determinations and maintain objective perspectives that will ensure only ―the
best of the best‖ are chosen to represent their units.
   A5.1.1. You will apply integrity during competition proceedings and you will not divulge
   the results of this process. The 30 SW/CC and CCC will announce winners at the
   recognition luncheon/banquet.
   A5.1.2. You must be fair, equitable, consistent, and impartial. Any prejudice or bias
   (positive or negative) must be set-aside during the competition board. Air Force core values
   must be adhered to at all times.
A5.2. Packages. You must read and evaluate each package on its own merit. Objectivity is the
key to ensuring each nominee receives fair treatment and consideration.
   A5.2.1. Read the contents of each package and absorb the material presented. Ensure the
   package is factual, detailed, and understandable.
   A5.2.2. Review the package and ensure all information is presented in accordance with the
   requirements of this instruction (e.g., format, mechanics, etc…).
       A5.2.2.1. Evaluate the packages based on the substance of the content provided. The
       quality and impact of the accomplishments are very important. You should compare the
       accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly.
       A5.2.2.2. Keep in mind it is not your perceived ―importance‖ of one‘s job you‘re rating,
       but what the individual did within their job.
A5.3. Scoring. Once you‘ve read and reviewed each package, you‘re ready to score.
   A5.3.1. Pay careful attention to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count for
   anything. They actually detract from the write-up. Bullets that are listed in an incorrect
   category (for example, a job performance-related bullet listed in the significant self-
   improvement category) may negatively impact the overall score.
   A5.3.2. Point System. The scoring for each award package is determined APCM and is
   approved by the 30 SW/CC/CV/CCC and CD.
       A5.3.2.1. After all packages are scored, the highest composite scores amongst the
       nominees will dictate the overall winning package. The board president will record this
       result and forward the winner‘s information to the APCM.
   A5.3.3. Ties are not allowed. The board president will score all packages. The board
   president‘s score will determine the winner in the event of a tie.
