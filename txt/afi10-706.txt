SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. Primary areas
of change include the complete reformatting to reflect capability development and sustainment
through the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel and
facilities (DOTMLPF) construct and the addition of Tier waiver authority numbers for each unit
(wing or equivalent, and below) compliance item, as directed by AFI 33-360. The name was
changed to Electronic Warfare from the previous Electronic Warfare Operations since this
publication is not intended to address EW operations, but capability development and
sustainment via DOTMLPF. Also, this document updates EW terminology, doctrinal and
operational EW procedures, current requirements guidance via the Joint Capabilities Integration
and Development System (JCIDS) process, and organizational names and designations.

                                            Chapter 1

                                           DOCTRINE

1.1. Doctrine: Provides fundamental principles by which military forces guide their action in
support of national objectives. Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 3-13.1, Electronic
Warfare, defines electronic warfare (EW) as any military action involving the use of the
electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to include directed energy (DE) to control the EMS or to attack
an enemy.
     1.1.1. The EMS is divided into three portions:
        1.1.1.1. Radio Frequency (RF) used by communications systems such as radios,
        cellphones, WIFI wireless networking technology and data links, radars such as airborne
        intercept, air defense or navigation and millimeter-wave systems.
     1.1.2. Electro-Optic (EO) which includes infrared (IR), visible light, and ultraviolet (UV)
     sub-divisions, used by flares or infrared countermeasures systems or lasers.
     1.1.3. Ray which includes gamma rays, X-Rays, etc.
1.2. The three major components of EW: Are electronic attack (EA), electronic protection
(EP), and electronic warfare support (ES).
     1.2.1. EA involves the use of electromagnetic energy, DE, or anti-radiation weapons to
     attack personnel, facilities, or equipment. The primary effects achieved by EA are deception,
     disruption, denial, degradation and destruction. Creating precise EA effects will also require
     use of a battle management function. This includes spectrum management to ensure
     electromagnetic spectrum deconfliction in multiple dimensions (e.g. time, altitude and
     distance).
        1.2.1.1. EA includes any actions taken to prevent or reduce an enemy's effective use of
        the EM spectrum. Techniques include jamming, electromagnetic deception, or direct
        attack of an enemy's electronic capabilities through the employment of weapons that use
        either electromagnetic energy or DE (e.g. lasers, radio frequency, high power microwave
        [HPM] weapons, and particle beams) as their primary disruptive or destructive
        mechanism.
        1.2.1.2. Examples of EA systems include: Jammers onboard the EC-130H, COMPASS
        CALL, F-16CJ with High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARMs), chaff, flares, self-
        protection jamming systems, Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM), active
        towed decoys, and counter remote/radio controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED)
        systems.
     1.2.2. EP involves means taken to protect personnel, facilities, and equipment from the
     effects of friendly or enemy employment of EA or other EM spectrum capabilities (such as
     an electromagnetic pulse [EMP]) that have the potential to degrade, neutralize, or destroy
     friendly combat capability. Examples of EP include: frequency/pulse repetition frequency
     (RF/PRF) agility, or laser eye protection (LEP).
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                            5


   1.2.3. ES involves actions tasked by, or under direct control of, an operational commander to
   search for, intercept, identify, and locate sources of intentional and unintentional radiated
   electromagnetic energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning,
   and conduct of future operations. Examples of ES systems include: radar and laser warning
   receivers (RWR/LWR), the HARM targeting system, sensors forward capabilities, Rapid
   Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS), GPS jammer geo-location
   systems or the Battlefield Laser Detection System (BLADES).
1.3. EW employs the following doctrinal tenets:
   1.3.1. Control. Achieved by means of effective management and coordination of friendly
   EW systems that protect friendly use of and deny adversary access to key areas of the
   electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic Warfare Battle Management (EWBM) is an example
   of an EW function that could be used to improve control of EW resources.
   1.3.2. Exploit. To exploit is to use the EM spectrum to the advantage of friendly forces.
   Friendly forces can use deception, disruption, denial, degradation and destruction in varying
   degrees to impede the adversary’s decision loop. For instance, one may use electromagnetic
   deception to convey misleading information to an enemy or use an enemy’s electromagnetic
   emissions to locate and identify the enemy.
   1.3.3. Enhance. Enhancers are those intangibles that allow EW to function as a force
   multiplier, from self-protection to operational attack, thus greatly improving the likelihood of
   mission success on multiple levels of conflict. The primary example of an EW enhancer is
   the training function.
   1.3.4. The tenets are used by EA, EP and ES to produce the effects of detection, denial,
   disruption, deception and destruction in varying degrees to enhance overall mission
   objectives.
1.4. EW’s primary functions in air operations are to: a) support air campaigns through
counter-IADS; b) support Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD); c) disrupt military C2
nodes; and d) disrupt non-IADS systems. EW supports operations such as offensive counterair
and defensive counterair as described in AFDD 3-01, Counterair Operations, as well as SEAD.
In fact, EW assets are frequently the most vital to any effective operation to suppress enemy
command and control (C2), integrated air defense systems (IADS), and other significant military
capabilities utilizing the EMS. Not only are friendly EW capabilities critical, enemy EW
operations, if left unhindered, could have devastating effects on friendly C2 systems. Early and
persistent efforts should be aimed at defeating enemy EW capabilities.
1.5. EW: Is evolving due to technological advances and an increasing reliance on the EMS
within military and civilian sectors.
   1.5.1. While EW retains its traditional role in counterair, it intersects or supports other
   military capabilities such as spectrum management, irregular warfare (IW), navigation
   warfare (NAVWAR) and information, cyberspace, and space operations.
       1.5.1.1. Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) are the coordinated efforts
       of EW and joint electromagnetic spectrum management operations to exploit, attack,
       protect, and manage the electromagnetic environment (EME).
6                                                                       AFI10-706 14 May 2014


       1.5.1.2. During IW, EW can influence adversary and/or friendly population in an effort
       to win popular support.
       1.5.1.3. Information Operations (IO) is, “the integrated employment, during military
       operations, of information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to
       influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential
       adversaries while protecting our own” (JP 3-13). EW contributes to IO by using
       offensive and defensive tactics to shape, disrupt and exploit adversarial used of the EMS
       while protecting friendly freedom of action. As an information-related capability (IRC),
       EW can stand alone in a traditional function, or can enable, support, and enhance its sister
       IRCs. Proper execution of EW activities is critical when supporting other IRCs such as
       Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO), Military Information Support Operations
       (MISO) or military deception (Ref to Information Operations, AFDD 3-13). The
       operational level continues to be the optimal place for the synchronization of IRC
       activities (Ref to Attachment 2, USAF EW Support to Joint Task Forces). Due to the
       complementary nature of and potential synergistic effects of EW and computer network
       operations, each must be coordinated. EW capabilities may permit use of the
       electromagnetic spectrum as a maneuver space for cyberspace operations. EW
       capabilities may serve as a means of accessing otherwise inaccessible networks to
       conduct cyberspace operations; presenting new opportunities for offensive action as well
       as the need for defensive preparations.
    1.5.2. As our recognition of EW capability intersections with other areas (i.e. cyberspace,
    information and space operations) grows, our need to address the growing list of networks
    using commercial technologies grows also. Emerging non-IADS targets include non-military
    leadership networks, commercial/media networks, communications networks, positioning,
    navigation, timing networks, and others as directed by a combatant commander (CCDR).
    EW targeting must comply with applicable rules of engagement and the law of armed
    conflict.

                  ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. This chapter defines the roles and responsibilities of: Air Force organizations charged
with developing, fielding, operating or sustaining EW capabilities.
   2.1.1. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5) will:
       2.1.1.1. Be accountable for the United States Air Force (USAF) EW policy, doctrine,
       strategy as well as prioritization of operational capabilities. Serve as the office of
       responsibility (OPR) for all Air Force EW DOTMLPF actions.
   2.1.2. Employ an Electronic Warfare Advisory Group (EWAG) to address cross-major
   command (MAJCOM) EW issues. The EWAG is chartered to identify and prioritize EW
   issues to ensure the Air Force is organized, trained, and equipped to conduct combat
   operations. The EWAG may report its findings/recommendations to the Air Force

       Forces (RFF) from the acquisition, engineering, test and evaluation, communications or
       intelligence communities will be mission ready IAW HAF, MAJCOM or Numbered Air
       Force (NAF) guidance prior to deployment.
   3.2.4. Advanced Level Training: The CAF, in coordination with AETC, has oversight for
   advanced EW training above the unit level to provide an in-depth knowledge of national
   assets, EA targeting, and joint/combined operations necessary to equip the commander with
   integrated EW capabilities in an effort to meet operational objectives. NOTE: Hands-on, in
   depth graduate level engineering courses are available to EW acquisition and engineering
   professionals through the EW T&E University, operated and maintained by the 771TS/412
   EWG, Edwards AFB, CA. EW testing requires an extensive understanding of threat systems,
   threat modes, range assets, and various EW systems under test. Engineers need to
   understand the importance of emerging threats, proliferation, threat laydowns, and threat
   functionality to better develop effective test methodology. EW T&E U provides classified
   course offerings that are not available to the general public. The courses are intended to
   provide an array of EW knowledge to beginner engineers as well as build, develop, and
   maintain EW engineering expertise for those more experienced professionals.

3.3. Coalition operations: Create unique challenges on the battlefield. Therefore the entire Air
Force EW community will maintain awareness of foreign system capabilities to determine their
interoperability within a coalition environment.
3.4. The culmination of EW effectiveness and integration: Is best evaluated during exercises
and will address Force Application (FA) and Force Protection (FP) Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTP) to measure how well specific EW capabilities support Air Expeditionary Force
(AEF) requirements.
   3.4.1. Exercises can take on many levels of sophistication ranging from unit-level exercises
   to AEF preparation. Whenever possible, the 57th Adversary Tactics Group and similar
   opposing force (OPFOR) organizations will be incorporated to emulate adversary EW from
   ground, air, space, or cyberspace. Exercise scenario developers must take into account EW
   targets and effects in the battlespace since non-kinetic attacks are challenging to integrate
   into scripts.
   3.4.2. Large force exercises (e.g., Red, Blue, Green and Cyber Flags) will incorporate both
   offensive and defensive EA activities. SERENE BYTE reprogramming activities should be
   considered for inclusion during all large force exercises. Where possible, activities should
   include other services and allied partners to fully exploit joint/combined operational training
   opportunities.
3.5. Organizations employing EW resources: Should regularly analyze their EW training and
their associated enablers to modify or establish new training requirements as needed.
MAJCOMs will assess the quality of EW training and identify any gaps or shortfalls.

                                           Chapter 4

            MATERIEL DEVELOPMENT, SUSTAINMENT & READINESS

4.1. Developing, sustaining and improving materiel solutions: Derives from Title 10 United
States Code (USC) statutory responsibilities which outlines Air Force functions of “organize,
train and equip.” The equip function includes activities such as acquisition, maintenance, and
repair of military equipment.
   4.1.1. Development. The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) is
   used to determine the requirement for and support of the acquisition of a materiel EW
   solution to a validated capability gap. JCIDS is a key component of the Capabilities-Based
   Planning (CBP) process and operates hand-in-hand with the Planning, Programming,
   Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. The guidance contained in this document does
   NOT take precedence over that found in AFI 10-601 when validating EW requirements. In
   addition, information from this document will be used in concert with the guidance found in
   AFI 10-604, Capabilities-Based Planning and AFI 63-101/20-101.
       4.1.1.1. The Air Force defines its core duties and responsibilities into thirteen core
       functions to be used across the DOTMLPF spectrum. The core functions are: Air
       Superiority (AS), Global Persistent Attack (GPA), Education and Training (ET),
       Personnel Recovery (PR), Command and Control (C2), Global Integrated ISR (GIISR),
       Nuclear Deterrence (ND), Space Superiority (SS), Cyber Superiority (CS), Special
       Operations (SO), Rapid Global Mobility (GPM), Agile Combat Support (ACS), and
       Building Partnerships (BP). MAJCOMs will develop requirements for, acquire, field,
       operate and sustain EW-related systems that achieve desired effects in order to control
       the electromagnetic spectrum in support of the core functions.
   4.1.2. Developers, operators, planners, or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) involved with
   developing new EW systems must understand the EME to ensure fielded systems can
   achieve desired effects and to prevent undesired effects from occurring. These fielded
   capabilities must be deconflicted with other capabilities being employed in or across the
   entire battlespace to prevent fratricide within the EMS.
   4.1.3. Test and evaluation relies on support from the acquisition and exploitation activities of
   the Air Force FMP to provide data on the technical and operational vulnerabilities of foreign
   systems.
       4.1.3.1. EW-related testing must occur in the most operationally representative and
       relevant environment practical. Therefore, the Air Force FMP will provide representative
       systems to the maximum extent possible. AFMC test and evaluation organizations
       provide threat representative EW systems when FMP assets are not available.
       4.1.3.2. A systematic understanding of the concept of threat employment, capability, and
       proliferation is necessary to determine the priority for acquisition of new adversary
       systems or upgrades to older systems. Conclusions obtained from the FMP/Foreign
       Materiel Exploitation (FME) will be incorporated into the appropriate target and threat
       analysis documents. During resource prioritization, consideration will be given to the
       exploitation of non-IADS emitters, when appropriate, in addition to traditional IADS
       emitters.
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                         19


4.2. Sustainment. This section provides guidance to agencies charged with EW sustainment
efforts related to EWIR and test & evaluation associated with EW systems.
   4.2.1. EWIR is a systematic process designed to increase aircrew survivability and mission
   success while operating in an environment characterized by friendly, neutral, and hostile
   systems that use the EMS.        EWIR provides the Commander, Air Force Forces
   (COMAFFOR), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) or Combined Force Air
   Component Commander (CFACC) as well as units a timely and accurate means to detect,
   identify and respond to electromagnetic emissions. EWIR functions within the scope of
   electronic warfare (EW) are governed by AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
   Reprogramming.
   4.2.2. Testing of EW related mission data software changes, minor system software changes,
   and minor hardware changes must be conducted in accordance with the processes outlined in
   AFI 99-103 and AFI 33-580. When performing EA in the US and Canada for testing,
   training, and/or exercises, users will comply with CJCSM 3212.02C. Spectrum-related data
   shall be collected and administered in accordance with DoDI 8320.05.
4.3. Readiness. Lead MAJCOMs are charged with the responsibility of conducting readiness
assessments of EW systems associated with their weapons platforms on at least an annual basis.
Assessments will also be conducted on support equipment and training devices.
   4.3.1. AFLCMC and the Air Force Sustainment Center having EW self-protection
   (Defensive EA) systems within their portfolio will coordinate with the respective MAJCOM
   requirements communities on state of health reports identifying key system shortfalls, gaps
   or future trends. These reports will be forwarded onto AF/A2C, A2D, A2R, A3O, A4L,
   A5R, or A5X for follow-on Air Staff actions.
   4.3.2. MAJCOMs will establish readiness standards for EW systems based on their
   operational requirements to ensure sufficient numbers of fully mission capable systems are
   available to meet operational commitments. Commanders will assess their EW systems by
   evaluating them against MAJCOM guidance and input the results into the Defense Readiness
   Reporting System (DRRS).
   4.3.3. MAJCOM A3 divisions will establish equipment readiness levels for specific self-
   protection (Defensive EA) systems (e.g., ALQ-131, ALQ-172, or AAR-47) or Offensive EA
   targeting systems (i.e., AN/ASQ-213 / HARM Targeting System [HTS]).
       4.3.3.1. EW system effectiveness assessments for fighter aircraft will be accomplished
       via the COMBAT SHIELD program. Other aircraft types should model their
       effectiveness assessments after the COMBAT SHIELD example whenever possible.
       4.3.3.2. Visiting assessment teams, similar to those used by COMBAT SHIELD, should
       be used to the maximum extent possible for annual certification or pre-deployment
       system ring outs.
   4.3.4. Units will take advantage of all opportunities to exercise their respective systems and
   support equipment to determine operational status.
   4.3.5. IG programs will evaluate and report the readiness of unit EW systems, associated
   maintenance equipment, and associated training devices.
 20                                                                   AFI10-706 14 May 2014


                                          Chapter 5

                              LEADERSHIP & EDUCATION

5.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF): Provides the strategic vision for EW. This is
articulated in the USAF EW Roadmap/EW Vision 2030 (EV2030) as a robust suite of
capabilities to enable control of the EMS to assure freedom of operation and primary effects in
and through all domains which include air, space, cyberspace, land and maritime. EV2030
covers the period from 2010 to 2030, delineated into three phases: Near-term (present to FY17),
Mid-term (FY18 – FY23) and Far-term (FY24 – FY30). For each phase, the roadmap specifies
actionable steps organized by DOTMLPF. These actionable steps deliberately map to desired
end states in four distinct EW capability areas: Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA), Self-
Protection (survivability), DE and EW Battle Management/Support, all of which are derived
from the Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) and Air Force Core Functions.
5.2. Air Force EV2030 Report Card: AF/A5R, via the EW SAG, will provide an annual
“Report Card” to AF/A3/5 assessing progress against each EV2030 milestone. HAF is
responsible for updating this document and coordinating those changes with the MAJCOMs.
5.3. EW Advisory Group (EWAG). This the Air Force corporate body for facilitating
effective integrated management of AF EW across DOTMLPF. It is responsible with ensuring
the most effective and efficient utilization of materiel capabilities, including requirements
refinement and endorsement, technology and system development, procurement and fielding,
sustainment/upgrading, and eventual retirement (AF EWAG Charter, Oct 2010).
   5.3.1. EW Senior Advisory Group (EW SAG). Membership in this organization, which is
   co-chaired by HQ AFMC/A2/5 and AF/A5R, is comprised of General Officer/SES
   stakeholders from the HAF, ARC and MAJCOMs. The EW SAG shall meet at least
   annually in order to support the PPBE process. It sets the objectives and provides
   recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF.
   5.3.2. EW Technical Advisory Group (EW TAG). Co-chaired by AFLCMC/XZI and
   AF/A5RE, the EW TAG shall meet at least semi-annually and serves as the focal point for
   coordination and collaboration for achieving EWAG objectives, provides direction and
   oversight to any EW integrated product teams (IPT), and makes recommendations to the
   SAG. Membership consists of senior representatives at the O-6 level or civilian equivalents
   from the HAF, ARC, MAJCOMs, and other vested organizations (i.e., NSA, Sister Services,
   J-39, etc.). Leadership from the AF Reprogramming Centers (AFI 10-703) are key members
   of this group.
5.4. Electronic Warfare (EW) Test and Evaluation (T&E) Consortium. The AF EW T&E
Consortium works Test and Evaluation efforts through the AF EWAG and AF/TE. Chaired by
AF/TE, the AF EW T&E Consortium membership consists of senior representatives at the O-6
level or civilian equivalents from the MAJCOMs and test organizations with an interest in the
test and evaluation of EW systems. The EW T&E Consortium is the AF agent for coordinating
EW T&E activities including 1) recommending lead test organizations, 2) prioritizing test
facility use and modernization, 3) standardizing test practices, and 4) reducing duplication and
increasing efficiencies and effectiveness.
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                            21


                                            Chapter 6

                                          PERSONNEL

6.1. This chapter provides guidance concerning specialized manning, readiness,
proficiency and expertise: To increase the Air Force’s ability to maximize each component of
EW operations.
   6.1.1. Air Force EW personnel must be ready to operate at the strategic, operational, and
   tactical levels of warfare. Maintaining a professional fighting force requires personnel with
   in-depth knowledge of their EW specialty and an awareness of other IRCs. Career
   progression should facilitate development of this expertise and familiarization of these
   disciplines within individual career paths. This knowledge and experience will be tracked so
   personnel are readily identifiable for additional training opportunities or assignments.
   6.1.2. The primary method for identifying and tracking rated EW expertise (Air Force wide)
   is the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Individuals not in possession of an Electronic
   Warfare Officer (EWO) AFSC but having critical EW expertise will be distinguished via an
   “E” prefix to their primary AFSC. To ensure adequate expertise is available the following
   tasks will be accomplished:
       6.1.2.1. Air Force MAJCOM A3 (operations) divisions will identify which non-EWO
       AFSC officer positions require specialized EW knowledge and experience to their A1
       (manpower) counterparts. These positions include but are not limited to pilots,
       navigators, and operators (cyberwarfare and space control expertise), along with EW-
       related platform maintenance, intelligence, engineering, and acquisitions personnel.
       6.1.2.2. The HAF Director of Operations (AF/A3O) has oversight for “E prefix”
       management including recruiting, training, assignments, and career development studies
       or reports. Contact your local manpower office to obtain details on the current Unit
       Manning Document (UMD) with “E” prefixes attached to MAJCOM authorized AFSCs.
   6.1.3. Commands will manage their respective EW force structure to ensure their
   organizations have available resources for all documented UMD positions.
   6.1.4. Personnel readiness demands that properly trained and qualified individuals are placed
   where they are most needed. Commands utilizing Special Experience Identifiers to fill
   IO/IRC career force billets will also ensure their EW experts are easily identifiable and
   distinct from those with Offensive Cyber Operations, Space Operations or Military
   Information Support Operations proficiency in order to meet Air Force A3/5 operational
   tasks IAW AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air & Space Expeditionary Force.
6.2. MAJCOMs         will: Assess      their   EW      manpower       requirements      (operations,
maintenance/logistics, intelligence, and associated support staffs) and forward this information to
AF/A3O for follow-on action. In turn, HAF directorates will do the following:
   6.2.1. AF/A3O will assess authorized billets against MAJCOM requirements and fill
   positions requiring EW expertise.
   6.2.2. AF/A1M will determine the number of authorizations earned, correct grades and skill
   levels based on man-hour and work load factors.
 22                                                                   AFI10-706 14 May 2014


                                          Chapter 7

                                         FACILITIES

7.1. EW operators, maintainers, engineers and analysts require: Different types of facilities
to provide operational EW capability to the warfighter. Facilities including laboratories for
development and sustainment, installed systems test facilities, test & training ranges and
associated instrumentation are needed to test, train and prepare for combat operations.
   7.1.1. EW laboratories, ranges, and associated instrumentation support the EW development,
   demonstration, T&E and sustainment efforts needed to successfully operate in a congested
   and contested EMOE. These EW facilities maintain the ability to generate up-to-date
   red/gray/blue/white signals in order to accurately simulate the congested and contested EME
   of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments. They include:
       7.1.1.1. Anechoic RF Test Facilities: The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) operates
       anechoic RF facilities with a broad range of capabilities. They support the research,
       developmental and operational test communities, industry and U.S allied foreign
       militaries (partner nations) in the execution of EW and other RF test requirements.
       Anechoic facilities are used to absorb RF energy to reduce the electromagnetic
       reflections. This, in turn, simulates free-space (airborne) environments within acceptable
       limitations based on frequency and the size of the facility and the test article (system-
       under-test). The quiet RF environment allows for MIL-STD electromagnetic interference
       and compatibility (EMI/C) testing on various EW systems and other avionics.
       Additionally, anechoic facilities allow testing in a highly secure and controlled
       environment.
   7.1.2. The Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB supports installed systems
   testing for avionics test programs requiring a large, shielded chamber with RF absorption
   capability that simulates free space. The BAF provides the capability to:
       7.1.2.1. Investigate and evaluate anomalies associated with EW systems, avionics,
       tactical missiles and their host platforms.
       7.1.2.2. Accommodate tactical-sized, (single or multiple), or large vehicles that can be
       operated in a controlled EME with emitters on and sensors stimulated while RF signals
       are recorded and analyzed.
       7.1.2.3. Generate RF signals with a wide variety of characteristics, simulating
       red/gray/blue/white surface-based, sea-based, and airborne systems.
       7.1.2.4. Produce combination of signals and control functions emulating a wide variety
       of test conditions.
       7.1.2.5. Generate conditions that are not available on outdoor ranges from the aspect of
       signal density, pulse density and number of simultaneous types.
       7.1.2.6. Have the capabilities for real-time and post-test RF signal parameter
       measurement, instrument display recording, data analysis and test coordination, as well as
       providing the data for signal verification
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                            23


   7.1.3. The Joint Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (J-PRIMES)
   facility at Eglin AFB provides an environment to facilitate testing air-to-air and air-to-surface
   munitions and electronics systems on fighter-sized aircraft and land vehicles prior to open air
   testing. Jointly the J-PRIMES and the BAF facilities will provide complementary anechoic
   chamber capabilities to effectively test and field RF-centric systems and other avionics that
   must operate in a dense or high power electromagnetic environment. AFTC will work with
   program offices to determine which combination of anechoic chamber test capabilities can
   best support test requirements based on technical requirements, location, and schedule
   availability.
   7.1.4. The Electronic Warfare Aviation Integration Support Facility (EWAISF) at Robins
   AFB, Georgia and mission data (MD) development labs at Eglin AFB, Florida and Robins
   AFB are equipped and maintained to support the reprogramming process IAW AFI 10-703.
   7.1.5. The Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) Mission Simulation Laboratory
   (MSL) will provide a verified and validated mission-level simulation of integrated air
   defense systems. It provides the ability to model/test the effects of a variety of EW systems
   on the IADS, from end to end, within an operationally representative scenario not available
   elsewhere in size and density. Its strength lies in the ability to accurately model the air
   picture development to make it a relevant tool for providing answers for both the tester and
   the trainer for system and tactics effectiveness.
   7.1.6. The Multi-Spectral Test & Training Environment (MSTTE) will provide a multi-use
   threat EW capability supporting open-air and component-in-the-loop (CITL) testing and
   training on the Eglin Test and Training Complex (ETTC). MSTTE consists of a suite of
   fully instrumented threat air defense systems operated across the Eglin ranges. There are 13
   primary threats that support multiple programs. A few additional systems are dedicated for
   and funded by specific customers. The primary purpose of the MSTTE systems is to support
   open-air testing. The systems are also available to provide EW training for aircrews.
   MSTTE also provided the capability to support open-air CITL testing using a tower complex,
   the Electronic Systems Test Facility (ESTF). This enables testing/developing EW algorithms
   and techniques. The location of the MSTTE assets provides a unique synergism with other
   test capabilities on Eglin, creating an integrated precision measurement capability.
   7.1.7. Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) facilities include the Guided Weapons Evaluation
   Facility (GWEF) at Eglin AFB. The GWEF will support testing of domestic munitions
   systems and in its EW role, will provide infrared countermeasure (IRCM) HITL testing to
   evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasure systems to defeat electro-optical and infrared
   threat missiles. In order to provide effectiveness evaluations, the GWEF will maintain and
   operate validated HITL simulations employing actual threats against simulated targets
   emitting in the optical band of the threat missile. These simulations allow thousands of
   simulated engagements under varying aircraft operating conditions to determine if flares,
   directed energy, or laser countermeasures are effective in defeating threat missile guidance
   systems.
7.2. The Air Force test and training range infrastructure:
   7.2.1. Provides open-air operation in support of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons
   DT/OT&E for DoD, non-DoD and commercial customers.
24                                                                    AFI10-706 14 May 2014


  7.2.2. Includes mission scheduling, test & training resources, test operations, and test
  analysis in support of weapons and command, control, communications, computers, and
  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) test programs.
  7.2.3. Supports MAJCOM EW investment and modernization efforts.
7.3. MAJCOMs will:
  7.3.1. Acquire, maintain and sufficiently fund T&E facilities such as Integrated System Test
  Facilities (ISTF), like those at Arnold, Edwards and Eglin Air Force Bases and mission
  simulation laboratories at Arnold, Edwards, Eglin, Holloman and Kirtland Air Force Bases
  which provide key T&E capabilities to ensure EW programs meet validated operational
  requirements. Conducting EW testing in these facilities enables the identification of issues
  prior to open air testing, and reduces the expensive and time-consuming “fly-fix-fly” process.
  These facilities support:
     7.3.1.1. EW range test and training operations.
     7.3.1.2. Anechoic radio frequency test facilities for antenna tests, installed systems tests,
     and RF interoperability/compatibility tests.
     7.3.1.3. Building and maintaining live-virtual-constructive (L-V-C) EW operations.
     7.3.1.4. Operation of HITL capabilities to support evaluation of aircraft self-protection
     systems against ground and airborne threat missile systems, ISR systems, and radar
     systems. An example of this capability exists at Edwards AFB in the Integrated Facility
     for Avionics Systems Test (IFAST).
     7.3.1.5. Operation of HITL capabilities to support evaluation of guidance, navigation and
     geo-location systems in threat-representative NAVWAR environments such as the 746th
     Test Squadron’s Navigation Test and Evaluation Laboratory (NavTEL).
  7.3.2. Ensure a T&E process is incorporated into each acquisition program’s Test and
  Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), which documents the overall structure and objectives of the
  T&E program. The objective is to identify overall T&E activities to be performed by the
  government and system contractors. This will guide the development of specific test events
  and direct the integration and utilization of AF ground test facilities into these events.
  MAJCOMs will ensure the TEMP documents the T&E schedule and test resource
  requirements. All Air Force EW test activities will utilize AF test facilities for applicable
  tests if possible. If an EW ground test requirement cannot be met with the use of an existing
  AF ground test facility, it will be documented in the TEMP T&E schedule and will require a
  waiver from AF/TE.

Terms
Note: The purpose of this glossary is to help the reader understand the terms used in this
publication. It is not intended to encompass all pertinent terms. Joint Publication 1—02,
Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, and the Air Force Glossary
(https://www.doctrine.AirForce.mil/Library/AirForceGlossary.asp) contain standardized
terms and definitions for Department of Defense and United States Air Force use.
Capabilities—Based Planning (CBP) — CBP is planning under uncertainty to provide
capabilities suitable for a wide range of challenges and circumstances, all designed to achieve
certain battlespace effects. The Air Force uses a capabilities-based planning process based on
analysis to identify required capabilities and capability objectives. Joint Capabilities Integration
and Development System (JCIDS) analysis and A5X capabilities-based planning are primary
contributors to the Air Force planning process, but top-down direction, urgent warfighter needs,
technological opportunities, and experiments and demonstrations provide other means for
identifying the need for a new capability.
Capability— The ability to achieve an effect to a standard under specified conditions through
multiple combinations of means and ways to perform a set of tasks.
Capability Gap— Those synergistic resources as measured by employing DOTMLPF analysis
currently unavailable but potentially attainable for future operational tasks.
 30                                                                      AFI10-706 14 May 2014


Capability Shortfall— A lack of full military utility needed by an operational user to effectively
execute a task.
COMBAT SHIELD— System level assessments of the CAF fighter fleet with the dual goals of
reporting to Air Force leadership on the overall state of EW health of the fighter fleet and
providing unit commanders with on-site analysis and feedback on the readiness of their EW
defensive and targeting systems. Not applicable to AFSPC.
Core Function— Core duties and responsibilities the Air Force performs as a Service to be used
across doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and
facilities.
Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI)— Office/individual charged with providing guidance
for the development of the CFMP.
Core Function Master Plan (CFMP)— Document that translates the vision of one of the
twelve core functions into a risk-informed, resource-constrained planning force proposal that
informs follow-on Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and Science and Technology (S&T)
activities.
Cyberspace— A global domain within the information environment consisting of the
interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet,
telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.
Electromagnetic pulse (EMP)— Is the generation and radiation in a transmission medium of a
very narrow and very high-amplitude pulse of electromagnetic noise. The term is associated with
the high-level pulse because of a nuclear detonation and with an intentionally generated narrow,
high-amplitude pulse for EA applications. In nuclear detonations, the EMP signal consists of a
continuous spectrum with most of its energy distributed throughout the low frequency band of 3
to 30 kHz.
Electronic Warfare (EW)— Any military action involving the use of electromagnetic (EM) and
directed energy (DE) to control the EM spectrum or to attack the enemy. The three major
subdivisions within EW are: electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic
warfare support (ES).
Electronic Warfare Coordination Authority (EWCA)— The Joint Force Commander (JFC)
designee for the coordination of all Electronic Warfare activities within the theater of operations.
Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC)— A specialized portion of the Air Operations
Center (AOC) dedicated to achieving a commander’s EW related objectives for the
electromagnetic spectrum.
Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR)— A systematic process for
operational commanders to respond to a dynamic threat environment. It gives all Air Force units
a timely and accurate means to respond to expected and unexpected electronic emissions,
changes in air defense tactics, and unique mission requirements. These EWIR responsibilities
include procedures for changes in tactics, employment guidance, electronic warfare (EW)
equipment (software/hardware), aircrew training and training devices (i.e. threat simulators,
threat emitters) and other support systems.
Information Operations— “The integrated employment, during military operations, of
information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt,
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                         31


corrupt or usurp the decision-making of potential adversaries while protecting our own.” (JP 1-
02)
Information operations (IO)- are the integrated employment of the capabilities of influence
operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations, in concert with
specified integrated control enablers, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human
and automated decision making while protecting our own. (AFDD 3-13) (Italicized definition
applies only to the Air Force)
Interoperability— The ability of systems, units or forces to provide data, information, materiel,
and Services to and accept the same from other systems, units or forces and to use the data,
information, materiel and Services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.
NSS and ITS interoperability include both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-
end operational effectiveness of that exchanged information as required for mission
accomplishment.
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)— A Joint concepts-centric
process that supports the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the JROC in identifying, assessing, and
prioritizing joint military capability needs and identifying integrated DOTMLPF solutions
(materiel and non-materiel) to fill those needs within the DoD CBP process. Additionally,
JCIDS is a key element in the Chairman's effort to realize the initiatives directed in the
Transformation Planning Guidance.
Materiel Solution— A defense acquisition program (non-developmental, modification of
existing systems, or new program) that satisfies identified operator capabilities.
Network Operations (NetOps)— The integrated planning and employment of military
capabilities to provide the friendly net environment needed to plan, control and execute military
operations and conduct Service functions. NetOps provides operational planning and control. It
involves time-critical, operational-level decisions that direct configuration changes and
information routing. NetOps risk management and command and control decisions are based on
a fused assessment of intelligence, ongoing operations, commander’s intent, blue and gray
situation, net health, and net security. NetOps provides the three operational elements of
information assurance, network/system management, and information dissemination
management. Also called NetOps.
Offensive Cyberspace Operations— Cyberspace operations intended to project power by the
application of force in or through cyberspace. Also called OCO.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)— Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic
an operational environment as possible to estimate the prospective system’s operational
effectiveness and operational suitability. In addition, OT&E provides information on
organization, personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics. Within the Air Force, the Air Force
Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), conducts OT&E.
Proficiency— Estimate used during capability analysis that answers the question “How well do
we perform a given task (miles, minutes, percent, etc.)?” Together, proficiency and sufficiency
ratings will be used to determine overall health and risk of a capability to achieve an effect.
 32                                                                    AFI10-706 14 May 2014


RAMPOD— Operational R&M Assessment System supports all facets of maintaining, testing,
integrating, and evaluating changes to field data collection software programs (RCS). These
programs currently support the ALQ-131/184/188 EA Pods, ALE-40/45/47 chaff/flare systems.
Spectrum Management— Involves planning, coordinating, and managing use of the EM
spectrum through operational, engineering, and administrative procedures. Its objective is to
enable electronic systems to perform their functions in the intended environment without causing
or suffering unacceptable interference.
Sponsor— Domain owner responsible for all common documentation, periodic reporting, and
funding actions required for supporting the capabilities, development, and acquisition process for
a specific capability proposal.
Sufficiency— Estimate used during capability analysis that answers the question “Do we have
enough (troops, aircraft, supplies, etc.)?” Together, sufficiency and proficiency ratings will be
used to determine overall health and risk of a capability to achieve an effect.
User— An operational command or agency that receives or will receive benefit from the
acquired system. Combatant Commanders and their Service component commands are the users.
There may be more than one user for a system. Because the Service component commands are
required to organize, equip, and train forces for the Combatant Commanders, they are seen as
users of systems. The Chiefs of the Services and heads of other DOD components are validation
and approval authorities and are not viewed as users.
AFI10-706 14 May 2014                                                                       33
