   2.2.12. Single Vehicle Approval Test Certificate. Owners of any non-European Union (EU)
   specification vehicles imported into the UK, less than three (3) years of age, are required to
   have them officially inspected to ensure they are properly adapted for use within the UK.
   For US Force personnel only, a special one-time inspection and provisional Ministry of
   Transport (MoT) certificate is obtainable from approved UK and visiting forces garages for a
   fee. Upon successful completion of the inspection, the garage will issue a provisional MoT
   certificate over-stamped with the vehicle inspectorate (VI) and DfT logos and the statement
   VISITING FORCES PROVISIONS NEW VEHICLE. This certificate identifies the vehicle
   as a visiting forces vehicle and certifies the vehicle is properly adapted for use within the
   UK. Except for the visiting forces exemption, it is a legal requirement that vehicles meet EU
   specifications, or be “type approved”, and undergo a VI inspection before they can be used
   on the roads in the UK. The UK DfT and Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders have
   agreed on a code of practice for dealing with applications for “type approval” certification of
   foreign passenger vehicles. For additional inquiries and guidance on the VI inspection
   procedure and standards, or to obtain a copy of the Inspection Manual, contact the Vehicle
   Inspectorate, 91/92 The Strand, Swansea, SA1 2DH.
   2.2.13. MoT Certificate. A UK MoT safety inspection certificate is required for all vehicles
   that are over three (3) years old. The test and certificate can be obtained at any authorized
   British garage for a fee. The MoT inspection is mandatory annually for vehicles imported
   under any scheme and are over three (3) years old. The age of the vehicles is determined
   from the date of first registration shown on the registration document. If the vehicle was not
   new when first registered, the age is determined from the end of the year of manufacture.
   2.2.14. It is an offense to use any vehicle that is subject to this test on the public roads unless
   a valid test certificate is in force.
2.3. Accountability. Control over the acquisition and disposal of concession vehicles, except
for scrap, total loss, termination of entitlement and payment of revenue, is vested in the 100
SFS/S5SPR. Strict control over all concession vehicle transactions must be maintained by the
100 SFS/S5SPR and at each USAF, USA, and USN installation in the UK. See paragraph 2.5.
for tracking procedures.
2.4. Automated Support. Installation commanders, through the Chief, Security Forces or
Provost Marshal, are responsible for obtaining computer support for on-base or geographically
separated agencies. Support will consist of training computer operators as needed, technical
advice to operators and periodic use (daily, weekly, etc.) of computer equipment.
2.5. Tracking and Automated Procedures. Vehicle registrar offices located within the UK,
governed by this instruction and responsible to the 100 SFS/S5SPR, will comply with following
tracking and automated procedures to ensure the systematic flow of vehicle records to satisfy
HMRC and DfT requirements (T-1):
   2.5.1. Ensure the vehicle owner completes and signs the USAFE Form 3, Driver’s
   License/Vehicle Registration Application. The vehicle registrar maintains the signed
   USAFE Form 3 on file until no longer applicable (PCS, vehicle owner deregisters vehicles,
   etc.).
       2.5.1.1. The signed USAFE Form 3 gives implied consent to a chemical test of blood,
       breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the drug, alcohol content of blood if cited,

     requested or law- fully apprehended for an offense allegedly committed while in actual
     physical control of a motor vehicle or driving on the installation under the influence of
     any intoxicants, drugs or alcohol. Refusal to submit to such a chemical test will result in
     suspension, revocation of driving privileges, as further detailed in service motor vehicle
     operation regulations.
     2.5.1.2. The signed USAFE Form 3 also certifies that all information entered on the
     USAFE Form 3 in section II is the truth to the best of the vehicle owner’s knowledge. By
     signing, the vehicle applicant also understands that entering false information could result
     in administrative or disciplinary actions or denial of a US Forces driving license, permit
     or vehicle registration privileges.
  2.5.2. Use information from the USAFE Form 3 to update a computer-based program in the
  vehicle registrar offices. In order to be able to update 100 SFS/S5SPR, vehicle registrar
  offices will use a compatible computer-based program to record all vehicle information.

                                            Chapter 3

 CUSTOMS: INCIDENT TO IMPORT/ACQUISITION OF CONCESSION VEHICLES

3.1. General. Entitled persons are permitted to acquire, free of UK customs duty, VAT, and
road tax , motor vehicles for their private use and the use of their dependents, and to replace such
vehicles with further concession vehicles.
3.2. Entitlements. Single, unaccompanied personnel, who are members of the USAF, USA,
USN, USMC, or members of the civilian components of these services or DOD, are authorized
to own and operate not more than one concession vehicle. Personnel who are accompanied by a
dependent spouse, irrespective of command sponsorship, may own and operate not more than
two concession vehicles. These restrictions may be waived by HMRC for temporary periods not
to exceed 30 days to allow entitled persons to purchase or dispose of other concession vehicles.
If military personnel are married to another military member, each military member may own,
operate one concession vehicle (T-1).
   3.2.1. Base vehicle registrar offices will examine each application to acquire a concession
   vehicle and verify the applicant’s eligibility. When necessary, they will contact the local
   MPF, Civilian Personnel Office (CPO), or the applicant’s squadron commander to verify
   status.
   3.2.2. Concession vehicles imported by entitled persons will be exempt, subject to certain
   conditions, from vehicle excise duty (road tax) for a period not to exceed 12 months from the
   date of first registration with UK authorities. This exemption cannot be transferred with the
   vehicle if sold within the 12-month period. The exemption is not affected by the date the
   entitled person arrived in the UK or the number of concession vehicles the individual may
   import or purchase during his or her tour. At the end of the exemption period, the procedures
   outlined in para 4.4. apply.
3.3. Importation Incident to PCS. All concessions vehicles imported into the UK incident to a
PCS will be declared for entry by HMRC’s PTU office via the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941). It is
essential that these forms be completed correctly as a false declaration constitutes a serious
violation of UK customs laws. Entitled persons will personally appear at the base vehicle
registrar office to complete these forms. Concession vehicles may be imported unaccompanied
by the owner (i.e. shipped to a port by the US Government, to include a motorcycle as part of a
household goods shipment) or accompanied by the owner (i.e. driven into the UK). Only where
an entitled person drives a vehicle through a UK Port (incident to a PCS) will it be admitted into
the United Kingdom without the base registrar having issued the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941). In
all other cases, the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) will be authenticated by the base vehicle registrar
before the importation of the concession vehicle.
   3.3.1. Unaccompanied Vehicles. Six copies of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) will be
   completed at the base vehicle registrar office.
       3.3.1.1. For vehicles arriving via the VPC, two copies of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941)
       will be provided to the VPC by the member. The VPC will coordinate directly with the
       vehicle owner when the vehicle is ready for delivery. At the VPC, the owner will be
       asked to produce a valid USAFE Form 435, Driving/Fuel Permit, ID card, and a
       certificate of UK Insurance. Once the vehicle has been processed by the VPC, the owner
USAFEI31-209 3 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    15


      receives the vehicle and one copy of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941). The remaining
      copies are sent to HMRC’s PTU office by the VPC for NOVA processing. HMRC
      retains one copy and forwards the last copy to the 100 SFS/S5SPR. The 100 SFS/S5SPR
      will update the database and dispose of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) as appropriate.
      The vehicle owner will, within 72 hours of importation, register the vehicle at his or her
      base of assignment (see Chapter 4). Depending on local constabulary agreements, the
      vehicle owner can drive their vehicle on their previous license plate for no longer than
      one month from the date the vehicle was received from the VPC in order to complete
      British registration. Once the owner has British registration they will update their local
      Vehicle registrar with the current British registration number.
      3.3.1.2. For motorcycles arriving within a household goods shipment, the base vehicle
      registrar will stamp all five copies of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941). The base vehicle
      registrar will mail three copies to HMRC’s PTUoffice for NOVA registration. HMRC
      will retain two copies and forward the last copy to 100 SFS/S5SPR for processing. The
      member will be provided with two 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941), one to be presented to the
      household goods contractor or TMO representative for use in connection with household
      goods customs clearance via HMRC’s National Clearance Hub, Salford. The last copy of
      the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) is for the member’s records.
   3.3.2. Accompanied Vehicles. Personnel assigned PCS to the UK, normally as a result of a
   Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) from the continent; routinely import their vehicle in
   person into the UK. Military travel orders and a current military Identification Card, allows
   vehicle entry into the UK pending completion of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) at the
   gaining Pass and Registration office. The base vehicle registrar will stamp all copies of the 3
   AF Form 156 (C&E 941) and return one to the applicant. The base vehicle registrar will mail
   the remaining three copies to HMRC’s PTU office for NOVA registration. HMRC will
   retain two copies and forward the last copy to the 100 SFS/S5SPR for processing. The
   applicant will, within 72 hours of importation, register the vehicle at his or her base of
   assignment (see Chapter 4). Depending on local constabulary agreements, the vehicle owner
   can drive their vehicle on their previous license plate for no longer than one month from the
   date the vehicle was received from the VPC in order to complete British registration. Once
   the owner has British registration they will update their local Vehicle registrar with the
   current British registration number.
3.4. Importation Incident to Purchase Abroad. As with a vehicle imported incident to PCS,
new concession vehicles purchased abroad may be imported either unaccompanied or
accompanied.
   3.4.1. Unaccompanied Vehicles. Entitled persons may import a new vehicle ordered
   through a dealer or concessionaire acting as import agent. The agent will make all
   arrangements for obtaining UK registration. The 3 AF Form 156(C&E 941) will be obtained
   from the base vehicle registrar office upon presentation of a properly completed purchase
   order. The customs officer will surrender the vehicle and one copy of the 3 AF Form
   156(C&E 941) to the agent for delivery to the applicant, mailing the other two copies to
   HMRC’s PTU office. HMRC will retain one copy and forward the last to the 100
   SFS/S5SPR for processing and filing. The applicant will, within 72 hours after delivery of
   the vehicle from the agent, register the vehicle at his or her base of assignment (see Chapter
   4) and retain his or her copy of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941). If the vehicle does not have a
 16                                                           USAFEI31-209 3 OCTOBER 2014


   vehicle registration plate, the owner is only allowed to drive the vehicle from the VPC to a
   MOT facility to complete the MOT or SVA and then their residence until they obtain their
   British Registration plate. Upon PCS, entitled persons will obtain a 3AF Form 430 from

   concessions will not be applied to new vehicles ordered and delivered from the UK stock of
   any agent. Vehicles must be imported in the name of the applicant on 3 AF Form 156 (C&E
   941).
   3.4.2. Accompanied Vehicles. Six copies of 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) will be completed
   by the local base vehicle registrar. Three copies of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) will be
   sent to HMRC’s PTU office by the VPC for NOVA processing. The agent will arrange with
   the factory to have the vehicle registered and have the appropriate registration plates
   mounted prior to arrival of the applicant. The applicant will obtain an insurance “Green
   Card” and ensure two copies of the 3 AF Form 156 (C&E 941) are in his or her possession

   duty and VAT in addition to the taxes already levied on the vehicle when purchased. Only if
   the vehicle is over 6 months of age and has traveled under its own power for 6,000
   kilometers will relief from VAT be granted upon import. Vehicle registrars will be familiar
   with the specific guidelines for UK taxation of NMT vehicles in HMRC VAT Notice 728.
   Vehicle registrars will differentiate and identify vehicles to the DVLA by endorsing the Form
   V55/5 in the bottom right hand corner with “NMT - VF” (New Means of Transport - Visiting
   Forces) or “Non-NMT - VF” (Non-New Means of Transport - Visiting Forces), as
   appropriate.

the agent, register the vehicle at his or her base of assignment (see Chapter 4). UK manufactured
vehicles will be UK registered and allocated UK license numbers and registration document (V-5).

       otherwise taken possession of by the entitled person.
       3.5.1.2. Prepare a letter indicating that he or she did not accept delivery of the vehicle.

   registrar office who will retain one copy and forward a copy along with the Section 9 of the
   V-5 (registration document) to DVLA Swansea.
       5.6.1.1. If the V-5 is not available (lost, destroyed, etc.), the applicant will explain the

   mail a certified check or postal money order for the exact amount in the pre-addressed
   envelope and await the customs clearance documents. The scrap transaction will not take
   place until the vehicle owner receives the clearance documents. In some cases, authorized
   scrap dealers will arrange to make payment of the customs charges for the seller only at the
   approval of HMRC. A check made out to “HMRC” and endorsed by the vehicle owner will
   be obtained from the scrap dealer. This will be mailed as stated above. The owner of the
   vehicle is still responsible to ensure the scrap dealer makes the payment.
   5.6.3. Entitled persons can engage in scrap business with any VAT registered and licensed
   scrap dealer.
   5.6.4. The base registrar will inform all personnel that the actual sale of a concession vehicle
   for scrap will not be made until approval from HMRC has been received, what required
   revenue has been paid and a letter of release (clearance) is issued by HMRC. Disapproval by
   HMRC of the request for sale of the vehicle for scrap requires the seller, registered owner to
   physically regain control of the vehicle and dispose of it by other means outlined in this
   instruction.
   5.6.5. Application to purchase a replacement vehicle will not be made until such time as
   scrap sale has been released from customs control or specific approval from the 100
   SFS/S5SPR has been granted.
   5.6.6. Applicants should be prepared for a delay of up to 60 days before scrap applications
   are cleared.
5.7. Release to Insurance Company as a Total Loss. Concession vehicles damaged beyond

coverage was in force and compensation is received for the vehicle.
   5.7.1. If the entitled person is covered by fully comprehensive insurance, he or she will
   obtain a letter from the parent insurance company (not the broker or agent who sells the
   policy) stating that the insurer accepts responsibility for the payment of any customs revenue
   for the vehicle. The letter must contain the policy number, a statement that the insurer will
   pay assessed revenue and all particulars on the insured. The owner may then accept total
   payment for the loss from the insurer and release the vehicle to the company.
       5.7.1.1. The letter will be forwarded to the 100 SFS/S5SPR who will forward to HMRC,
       Oxford.
USAFEI31-209 3 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      29

   the other driver (if applicable). The owner may only dispose of the vehicles according to
   para 5.6. or 5.8. should it be beyond economical repair.
   5.7.3. According to British law, individuals in part or full payments as part of an insurance
   settlement will not accept damaged concession vehicles. The insurance company must
   collect the remains of a vehicle from a “total loss” claim. In certain cases where third party
   insurance companies are involved in payment for damaged concession vehicles, HMRC will
   consider allowing the entitled individual to retain the vehicle remains and dispose of same in
   accordance with this instruction. In order for the individual to retain the remains of a vehicle,
   the individual will have to complete a written request to do so. The request will be
   forwarded to the 100 SFS/S5SPR by the vehicle registrar at the base concerned.
5.8. Release to DRMO. Entitled persons may dispose of vehicles by release to DRMO. The
owner will report to Security Forces Investigations and complete the required documents
necessary to relinquish the vehicle to the US Government. Investigations will notify the base
vehicle registrar office of the transaction. They will in turn take actions necessary to clear the
vehicle from the 100 SFS/S5SPR. Vehicle stripped of parts (engine, transmission, wheels, etc.)
will not be accepted for release to DRMO. Should an entitled person attempt to relinquish such a
vehicle, the base vehicle registrar office will be informed and an irregular disposal transaction
will be completed according to para 5.12.
   5.8.1. Applicants will prepare a DD Form 1348-1, Release Document for Unclaimed
   Property, in four copies, completely identifying the vehicle to be abandoned. The original
   and one copy of the form will be delivered to the disposal officer or the collecting agency as
   applicable. One copy will be retained by the base vehicle registrar office and the remaining
   copy by the vehicle owner. Upon final disposition, one copy of the form and the registration
   document (registered in the applicant’s name) will be forwarded to the 100 SFS/S5SPR.
   5.8.2. The base disposal officer or collecting agency will accomplish the following statement
   on the DD Form 1348-1: “THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN RECEIVED FOR
   ABANDONMENT IAW THE APPLICABLE INSTRUCTION”.
5.9. Repossession. In cases involving repossession of a concession vehicle by a creditor (bank,
credit union, etc.), the creditor will notify the base vehicle registrar office within 24 hours and
HMRC of the action. Once the base vehicle registrar office at the base concerned receives
required notification of repossession and has forwarded the documentation to the 100
SFS/S5SPR, then the matter of repossession becomes one between HMRC and the agency that
repossessed the vehicle. An agreement exists between HMRC and the Keesler Federal Credit
Union (KFCU). In this agreement, should the KFCU find a member of the US visiting forces
who wishes to purchase the vehicle, the base vehicle registrar office will initiate four copies of 3
AF Form 301, Vehicle Transfer Request. KFCU will be listed as the seller. The lower portion
will reflect the new buyer’s information. The base vehicle registrar office will retain one copy of
the 3 AF Form 301 and forward the remaining three to the 100 SFS/S5SPR for onward
transmission to and action by HMRC. The proposed entitled buyer will not take possession of
the vehicle until the 3 AF Form 301 has been approved by HMRC.

5.10. Disposal upon Death of an Entitled Person. A duly appointed summary court officer
may dispose of concession vehicles of deceased persons according to this instruction.
   5.10.1. The summary court officer must obtain the written permission of the heirs of the
   deceased in the form of a POA. Once approval is received, the summary court officer will
   take action to clear the vehicle from the 100 SFS/S5SPR records by completing one of the
   disposal actions outlined in this chapter. Base vehicle registrar offices may approve this
   transaction. A copy of the POA will be forwarded to the 100 SFS/S5SPR with the completed
   transaction documents.
   5.10.2. If a will is provided dealing with the disposition of the deceased estate, the summary
   court officer is authorized to complete the concession vehicle clearance directly with the 100
   SFS/S5SPR. The summary court officer will be assisted with completion of CE Form 1421
   under the provisions of Customs Notice No. 368 through HMRC Oxford, which authorizes
   relief from duty and tax on inherited goods if the widow is remaining in the UK.
5.11. Theft of Concession Vehicle. In cases involving theft of a concession vehicle, security
forces and civil police will be notified not later than 24 hours from the discovery of the theft. If
the vehicle is not recovered within 72 hours, the base vehicle registrar office will notify their
appropriate headquarters of the circumstances surrounding the theft. Owners should be
encouraged to insure their vehicles against theft when applying for base registration.
5.12. Irregular Disposal. A concession vehicle will be considered as an irregular disposal,
abandoned, or unclaimed in the event it comes into the possession, custody or control of any
military service or DoD agency other than voluntary release to the US DRMO by the owner at
any installation in the UK through loss, theft, etc. and is unclaimed by the owner. Such property,
however, will not be considered legally abandoned until all efforts have been made to locate the
owner, or next of kin, or legal representative in accordance with pertinent and applicable
directives. If unclaimed, the vehicle will be turned in to the US DRMO.
   5.12.1. An irregular disposal occurs when an entitled person sells a vehicle to an unentitled
   person (e.g., a British national), or in some other manner contrary to this regulation. Refer to
   para 5.1.1. regarding administrative hold requirements for this offense.
   5.12.2. When an irregular disposal is discovered, the base vehicle registrar office will
   complete 3 AF Form 5 in triplicate. One is retained on file and the remainders are forwarded
   to the 100 SFS/S5SPR. One copy will be sent to HMRC Oxford for revenue assessment. A
   charge letter will be forwarded to the owner through the 100 SFS/S5SPR to the base vehicle
   registrar office concerned. The owner will mail payment (certified check or postal money
   orders) in the pre-addressed envelope within 30 days of receipt. HMRC will process the
   payment and forward a receipt and CE Form 386 to the owner through the 100 SFS/S5SPR to
   the individual’s base vehicle registrar office. This will constitute proof that vehicle is no
   longer a tax-free unit.
5.13. Powers of Attorney (POA). POA’s are authorized in the following situations:
   5.13.1. Cases involving the death of an entitled person (see para 5.10.).
   5.13.2. Cases involving emergency PCS. In these cases, concession vehicle owners may
   appoint an attorney-in-fact and execute a POA authorizing the appointee to take necessary
   and permissible actions to dispose of any concession vehicle. Owners should be cautioned
USAFEI31-209 3 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     31


   that while a POA gives the authority to dispose of a vehicle in the owner’s stead, it does not
   give the appointee the responsibility to do so. The ultimate responsibility rests with the
   vehicle owner.
   5.13.3. Base vehicle registrar office can accept POA’s in cases involving 5.13.1. and 5.13.2.
   Anytime a POA is accepted, the base vehicle registrar office will forward a copy of the POA
   with any transaction documents to the 100 SFS/S5SPR.
5.14. Emergency or Unusual Situations. When an emergency or unusual situation arises
regarding the disposal of concession vehicles, the owner of the vehicles must accomplish a 3 AF
Form 301 transaction using the following guidelines:
   5.14.1. If the seller (owner) of the vehicle has departed the country and still has a concession
   vehicle in their name, they must accomplish a POA for an individual to deal with the
   situation. If the individual who has the POA does not have their entire entitlement of
   concession vehicles, they must register the vehicle in their name via the 3 AF Form 301 and
   the DVLA Form V-5. They are then the legal keeper of the vehicle and must meet the
   mandatory conditions identified in para 6.2.4. The keeper of the vehicle must accomplish the
   3 AF Form 301 transfer and V-5 actions within 3 duty days of receiving the POA.
   5.14.2. If the individual possessing the POA to deal with the vehicle already has their full
   entitlement of concession vehicles, the same procedure applies except the vehicle may only
   be operated to demonstrate its operability to a potential buyer. The vehicle must meet all UK
   DVLA requirements spelled out in Chapter 4, this instruction, for operation.
   5.14.3. If an entitled person cannot dispose of their concession vehicle prior to their
   departure from the UK, they must accomplish one of the disposal methods for concession
   vehicles as outlined in para 5.2., 5.3., 5.4., 5.5., or 5.6.
   5.14.4. Situations identified in para 5.14.1. and 5.14.2. must be coordinated with the 100
   SFS/S5SPR.

                                        PROHIBITIONS

6.1. General. Agreements between HMRC and USAFE-UK, prohibit certain activities
pertaining to concession vehicle transactions. Entitled persons should make themselves aware of
the following prohibited activities to ensure they are not obliged to pay customs duty, VAT and

   registrar office will channel inquiries to the 100 SFS/S5SPR and will not direct or encourage
   vehicle owners to contact HMRC without prior approval of the 100 SFS/S5SPR.
   6.2.3. The purchase of any concession vehicle for the purpose of further disposition, with or
   without profit, rather than for personal use, is prohibited, except for emergency situation as

   mandatory conditions are met.
       6.2.4.1. Personal import vehicles used incident to PCS must bear UK registration prior to
       disposal (see para 3.3.)

   6.2.8. No concession vehicle will be operated in the UK without being duly registered in
   accordance with UK law, meeting all UK safety and mechanical standards, and Chapter 4 of
   this instruction. It is a violation of UK customs laws for an entitled person to allow a UK
   national to operate a concession vehicle. Entitled persons should be advised that violation of
   this law could result in the impoundment of the vehicle involved in the offense pending
   payment of the customs revenue. Allowing garage attendants or authorized vehicle transfer
   company representatives to operate the vehicle for a short specific period is not considered a
   violation.
   6.2.9. Concession vehicles will not be retained in the UK after termination of entitlement
