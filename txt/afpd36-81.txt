This directive establishes Air Force policy for the collaborative oversight, management and
execution of the Total Force (TF) Human Resource Management (HRM) Enterprise domain.
This publication applies to all military and civilian (appropriated and non-appropriated)
personnel, members of the Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National
Guard (ANG), contractors and consultants (when contract performance supports the Air Force)
and non-Department of Defense (DoD) United States Government agencies whose personnel, by
mutual agreement, require support from or conduct operational activity with the Air Force.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication;
route Air Force Form 847 from the field through functional chain of command. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). In collaboration with the Chief of the Air

1. Purpose and Overview.
     1.1. This directive defines TF HRM governance responsibilities, relationships and
     integration points within the domain. It establishes the processes and relationships within the
     domain governing framework to ensure TF HRM strategies, policies, systems, processes and
     organizations are developed and implemented by various organizations. The intent is to
     foster innovation and integration enabled by connections among component and functional
     efforts resulting in increased efficiency and effectiveness. The TF HRM governance is the
     cross-component, integrated capability designed to administer the Air Force HRM domain
     for the RegAF, AFR and ANG. This governance also provides for a single integrated TF
     HRM domain voice to the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) and the Air Force Core
     Function Lead Integrators (CFLI). See Figure 1.1 for governance structure.
     1.2. The HRM Governance is a collaborative effort among three legally separate component
     organizations and is not intended to supplant component functional staffs. It is intended to
     enhance and provide balance when making HRM domain decisions. The functional staffs
     continue to conduct functional business and reviews. The HRM Governance increases
     overall management effectiveness by applying cross-component judgment, experience and
     analysis. Within the governance, any component may be tasked to serve as the lead agent in
     representing the HRM Domain while ensuring TF component equities and legal authorities
     are acknowledged and addressed in decision-making. HRM leaders will collaborate to align
     HRM domain strategy and integrate policy development and execution, align resource
     planning and programming, and create synergy around other areas affecting the TF HRM
     domain. At its best, alignment of strategy enables human capital professionals to become
     drivers of organizational and operational effectiveness.

2. Policy. The Air Force shall:
   2.1. Eliminate unnecessary duplication and optimize standardization, integration and
   collaboration to better develop and execute HRM capabilities across the TF.
   2.2. Optimize HRM services to Airmen and families in all components.
   2.3. Optimize Air Force capabilities across all components through TF HRM solutions.
   2.4. Provide a single TF HRM domain that fosters integration and innovation to pursue
   excellence.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
   3.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
   will serve as the approving official for all HRM Domain publications. This authority may be
   delegated to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and
   Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR (PDAS)).
   3.2. SAF/MR (PDAS) serves as the Human Resource Management Strategic Council (HSC)
   Chair. The Chair is also responsible as the certifying official for HRM Domain publications
   upon final 2-letter/digit coordination and concurrence. This authority will not be delegated.
   3.3. The HSC is the senior forum for cross-component consideration of the most critical Air
   Force HRM issues. This governance provides a means for SAF/MR to exercise “overall
   supervision of manpower and reserve component affairs for the Department of the Air Force”
   pursuant to Title 10 USC § 8016.
   3.4. The HRM Strategic Board (HSB) is chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
   Reserve Affairs (SAF/MRR) or designee. This board provides a strategic forum for initial

     corporate review and evaluation of HRM issues. The HSB will ensure each component is
     recognized as a mandatory coordinator on all HRM recommendations that will be presented
     to the HSC for consideration.
     3.5. The HRM Executive Secretariat (HRM-ES) is assigned to SAF/MRR and administers
     the TF HRM governance process, to include facilitation of the business of the HSC and HSB.
4. Objectives of the HRM Governance.
     4.1. The HRM governance will manage the publication approval process for all 34-Services,
     36-Personnel, and 38-Manpower and Organization series publications. All new and revised
     TF HRM Domain Air Force mission directives (AFMD), Air Force policy directives (AFPD)
     and publications will be reviewed by the HSB during initial 2-letter/digit coordination.
     Ensure direction for review of HRM Domain AFMD review is in accordance with Air Force
     instruction (AFI) 10-101, Format and Content of Air Force Mission Directives.
     4.2. When RegAF, AFR and ANG HRM Domain AFMDs/AFPDs are consolidated, created
     or updated, the following statements will be included in the opening paragraph: “In
     collaboration with the Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) and the Director of the
     Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and
     Services (HQ USAF/A1) develops personnel policy for [subject of publication]. This
     publication may not be supplemented.”
     4.3. When all other Air Force, AFR and ANG HRM Domain publications (AFIs, ANG
     instructions, Air Force Reserve Command instructions, Air Force guidance memorandas,
     etc.) to include interim changes (IC) are consolidated, created or updated, the following
     statements will be included in the opening paragraph: “In collaboration with the Chief of Air
     Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) and the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the
     Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (HQ USAF/A1) develops
     personnel policy for [subject of publication]. This Air Force publication may be
     supplemented at any level; MAJCOM-level supplements must be approved by the HSB prior
     to certification and approval.”
     4.4. This policy establishes the foundational structure for implementing strategy to inform
     decision-making influenced by Total Force HRM governance. (TF Integrated HRM Domain
     Strategic Alignment and Deployment).
     4.5. An objective of the TF HRM governance is to transform the principal values and focus
     of Air Force HR from transactional services to strategic partnerships.
     4.6. The HRM Domain is defined as the strategies, policies, systems, processes and
     organizations that produce and sustain the Air Force’s investment in human capital,
     impacting the TF human capital strategy. The HRM Domain hierarchical model of business
     activities is depicted in Figure 4.1.
     4.7. While working within their respective authorities and responsibilities, all component
     Chiefs (RegAF, AFR and ANG), governance body members, integration teams, business
     activity teams and functional and project leads will collaborate on HRM domain strategy
     alignment, policy integration, planning and programming and other areas impacting the TF
     HRM domain. The TF HRM Governance process will foster integration and innovation to
     ensure TF component equities are acknowledged and addressed in decision-making without

               usurping component Chiefs’ legal authorities. The ultimate goal of the HRM Governance is
               to provide a cross-component perspective on all key TF HRM issues, cut across barriers to
               improve the corporate decision-making process and provide a TF perspective on HRM issues
               entering the AFCS for resourcing.

5. TF HRM Governance Framework.
5.1. There are four HRM Integration and Innovation (I & I) areas of focus (Figure 1. 1)
that when integrated, provide the means for the HRM domain to produce the objective TF.
AF/A1X, NGB/A1X and AF/REPX are responsible for overseeing the integration of TF HRM
business utilizing I & I teams. Team composition will include representation from all
components to develop domain solution recommendations and impacts to the Business Activity
Team (BAT). The I & I areas of focus include:
        5.1.1. Resources I & I Team provides an integrated TF HRM perspective based on
        strategic planning that synchronizes programming, budgeting and execution to maximize
        the strategic effects of the HRM domain.
        5.1.2. Legislation and Policy I & I Team provides an integrated TF HRM perspective
        that ensures uniformity across HRM policies to the greatest extent practicable.
        Components will collaborate on HR policy decisions and documents. The TF HRM
        Governance will resolve points of divergence.
        5.1.3. Information Technology (IT) I & I Team provides an integrated TF HRM
        perspective to oversee the TF HRM investment in technology and develops approaches
        for leveraging IT resources.
        5.1.4. Human Resources (HR) Organization and Workforce I & I Team provides an
        integrated TF HRM perspective that ensures HRM domain organizations provide
        seamless services and HRM workforce development.
     5.2. There are eight HRM BATs. As depicted in Figure 4.1, these areas of focus represent
     top-line “Level 0” activities within the HRM Domain Architecture. Team composition will
     include representation from all components to develop domain solutions.
