                                           Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. What is the INTRO program? The INTRO Program includes base in-processing, base
newcomer orientation, and the Sponsorship Program.The INTRO Program is a tool that
commanders use to ensure members who have a pending relocation assignment are able to obtain
personal assistance through sponsorship. It is also used to provide members with the following
information concerning relocation to an overseas duty assignment:
     1.1.1. Availability of housing.
     1.1.2. Household goods weight limitations.
     1.1.3. Concurrent travel for family members.
     1.1.4. Non-concurrent travel for family members.
1.2. What is the Sponsorship Program? A continuous process of providing information and
assistance to relocating personnel and their family members from the time they receive their new
duty assignment until they are settled into their new community. The Sponsorship Program is
part of the INTRO Program which is designed to facilitate permanent change of station (PCS)
moves by welcoming and assisting newly arrived Airmen and their families. Sponsors provide
valuable service to inbound Airmen and help reduce the stress and anxiety that often
accompanies a PCS move through positive, open and honest communication.
1.3. Administering the INTRO Program. The INTRO Program provides assistance to newly
assigned personnel so they become effective contributors to their unit’s mission as soon as
possible. The unit commander is responsible for this program and must establish procedures to
ensure the program runs effectively. Each individual being reassigned to a new organization
requires timely and accurate information about his or her new duty assignment. All personnel
are entitled to maximum assistance, within available resources, to minimize problems that may
accompany relocation. The sooner personnel settle into their new duty station, the sooner they
can contribute to mission accomplishment.

                            STUDENTS AT TRAINING BASES

4.1. Sponsoring Students. Meeting the relocation needs of students is a unique challenge.
Ensuring training readiness for our students and mission readiness for personnel relocating upon
course completion requires a team effort from the following:
   4.1.1. Training Squadron Military Training Leader (MTL). The training squadron MTLs
   will:
       4.1.1.1. Provide an orientation for all incoming personnel from basic military training
       squadrons.
       4.1.1.2. Collaborate with follow-on training courses to obtain training course points of
       contact (POC), if applicable. Ensure outbound students contact POCs before departing
       for follow-on training.
       4.1.1.3. Ensure students receive a sponsor and have contact with the sponsor or gaining
       unit before departing for their permanent duty station.
   4.1.2. Student Assignments Section. The MPS student assignments section will ensure
   departing students out-process through the A&FRC relocation program.
   4.1.3. Formal Training Element. The MPF formal training element will:
       4.1.3.1. Brief permanent party personnel PCSing to formal training courses on reporting
       instructions, according to the education and training course announcement (ETCA)
       available at https://etca.keesler.af.mil.
       4.1.3.2. Ensure personnel traveling with family members out-process through the
       A&FRC relocation program.
   4.1.4. Officer Training School (OTS) and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
   Detachments. OTS and ROTC will ensure departing personnel receive a sponsor and have
   contact with the sponsor or gaining unit before they depart for their permanent duty station.
   4.1.5. A&FRC will:
       4.1.5.1. Work in partnership with training squadrons, formal schools, and unit or class
       POCs to respond to students' relocation needs.
       4.1.5.2. Work with MTLs to ensure both student and sponsor initiated inquiries are
       answered.
       4.1.5.3. Provide, as a minimum, relocation websites to include MilitaryHOMEFRONT,
       MilitaryOneSource; Move.mil and the AHRN.
4.2. Course POC. As a minimum, training squadrons will provide a website address and/or
designate a POC to provide information and assistance for incoming students. Base INTRO
Program Managers or the student assignments sponsorship manager will maintain an updated
roster of course POCs for their installation.
AFI36-2103 30 APRIL 2012                                                                     13

                                       EVALUATION

5.1. INTRO Questionnaire. Measurements (quality indicators) of the Sponsorship Program
have been developed and designed to:
   5.1.1. Provide leadership with critical and pertinent information about the health of the
   program.
   5.1.2. Increase understanding of the program and identify areas for improvement.
   5.1.3. Enable commanders to tailor their program to achieve specific strategic objectives for
   mission accomplishment.
   5.1.4. The MPS commander or designated representative will report Sponsor Program
   Quality Indicators to the installation commander quarterly.
5.2. Sponsorship Contact Efficiency. Sponsor contact efficiency measurements are taken from
the newcomer sponsorship survey and compiled to reflect how efficiently new arrivals are being
contacted. They directly link to the overall success or failure of the program because without
timely two-way communication with newcomers, the established goals and objectives of the
program are not being met. Efficient communication is vital to the program's success. Also,
reviewing these measurements over time provides critical trend information.
5.3. Sponsorship Program Effectiveness. Sponsorship program effectiveness measurements
are derived from the newcomer sponsorship survey and compiled to provide decision makers
with information about the overall health of the program. These measurements also provide
trend information, which may be useful for making informed decisions. Individual questions
may be added at base level to identify areas needing closer analysis.

                               CHECKLIST FOR SPONSOR

A4.1. The first impression a newcomer gets of a base comes from his or her sponsor. The
success of a good INTRO program is tied to first impressions. Since the needs of each
newcomer vary, a sponsor must find out what those needs are and respond to them.
A4.2. Call the newcomer and tell them you're there to provide information and assistance to
make the move smooth as possible. Listen: Many times a newcomer can reduce stress by merely
talking to someone "already there." Be open and honest and stay positive.
A4.3. Remember, it's not good enough to just say "let me know what you need," anticipate their
needs.
Ask these questions:
- Will your family members accompany you? Names, ages, interests?
- Do you need information about other services? Banking, child care, education, etc.?
- Do you want me to meet you when you arrive? Date, time, location.
- Do you want a post office box?
- Is there anything else you need?
A4.4. Pick up a sponsor kit from your Unit INTRO Program Manager. Personalize it by taking
out unnecessary information and adding information requested. Mail it within seven calendar
days.
A4.5. Include a personalized letter from your commander and your own personal letter. Include
your home and duty phone numbers and address. Remind newcomers to let you know of any
changes to their plans. Reconfirm the departure date, arrival date, and reporting-in date and
ensure member is aware of the 24 hour arrival point. Upon arrival, personally meet the
newcomer. Make the member feel welcomed.
A4.6. Visit the base housing office and get information about on- and off-base housing. If the
newcomer is interested in residing on-base, remind them to apply in advance.
A4.7. Make temporary lodging arrangements for the newcomer and family and communicate
details by personal email or phone.
A4.8. Personally meet your newcomer upon arrival or arrange for them to be met if you are
unable to do so personally due to duty commitments. Make sure that you directly email and/or
phone them to tell them who will be meeting them upon arrival or where to go for transportation
at an airport etc. Make sure you bring transportation that will accommodate the entire family as
well as pets.
A.4.9. Personally take the newcomer to lodging.

A.4.10. Personally take the newcomer to A&FRC and encourage them to use the Relocation
Program.

A.4.11. Introduce the newcomer to his/her commander, supervisor, key personnel and fellow co-
workers.
 20                                                              AFI36-2103 30 APRIL 2012


A.4.12. Show the newcomer around the base facilities such as commissary, fitness centers,
chapel, and Family Center.

A.4.13. Give the newcomer a community tour.

A.4.14. Accompany the newcomer through in-processing and check-in procedures.
AFI36-2103 30 APRIL 2012                                                                        21

 SAMPLE OF A UNIT COMMANDER'S WELCOME MEMORANDUM OR LETTER

1. Welcome statement:

Congratulations on your upcoming assignment at (XYZ) Air Force Base (AFB) and welcome to
the unit!

2. Statement about the squadron:

We look forward to including you on our team of professionals who are responsible for
___________________. In (name of squadron), we want to make sure you get all the
information and help you (and your family) need to make this the best move you've ever had and
to help you feel at home as soon as possible. Your sponsor, (name of sponsor), is a part of a
team, and (his/her) job is to find information for you, help solve your problems, meet you when
you arrive, and make it easier for you to in-process and get settled. Please keep (him/her)
advised of your plans and relocation needs.

3. Statement about the community:

If this is your first trip to the ______________ area, you'll find it (make some mention about the
weather, environment, community activities, etc.).

4. Statement about house hunting: (Does not apply for IMAs.)

Up to 8 days permissive leave is authorized for house hunting, and it begins after you sign in. If
you take house-hunting time before signing in, it counts as regular leave. Remember, if you
decide to make an advance trip to XYZ AFB for house hunting, you can take up to 10 days; but
you'll have to return to your current unit of assignment before being released from the base. Be
sure to check with the housing office before you sign a contract. It is required and they can
provide you with useful information about desirable areas to live. You will be able to get some
things done before you sign in, but certain items (such as travel pay), can only be done after you
sign in. I encourage you to sign in as soon as possible. Remember, your sponsor is here to help
you walk through the first few weeks and (he/she) has my support in doing that—be sure to use
(him/her).

5. Statement about spouse or family (if relevant):

The (XYZ) AFB Airman and Family Readiness Center would like to contact your spouse when
you arrive. The center's Heart Link is designed to help your spouse become familiar and
comfortable with our military community. Specifically, the A&FRC can help your spouse
navigate the military and local support system by providing information about employment, child
care, medical services, and area activities.

6. Statement about his or her responsibilities as a newcomer:

As an incoming unit asset, you are responsible for helping us ensure you have a smooth
transition to your new duty station. You are responsible for keeping your sponsor informed about
your exact itinerary and relocation needs. Your sponsor will be contacting you shortly, if not,
complete an INTRO Sponsorship Questionnaire (Attachment 3). Your sponsor is responsible for
assisting you during your relocation. Therefore, please provide the information as soon as
possible. Advise your sponsor of your departure plans. If you have delays or problems en route,
contact your sponsor and/or the first sergeant.

7. Conclusion:

Again, let me welcome you to (XYZ) AFB (or [XYZ] squadron). Please contact me directly if
there is anything I can do to make your move better. DSN __________, Commercial ( )
