Calendar" to avoid conflicts with other Keesler functions.

7.4.1.2. (Added) Adjutant’s call time, schedule of events and sequence of marching units are
identified in the wing parade notice. The Military Training Office (81 TRG/MTO) distributes
this notice no later than 15 working days prior to date of ceremony to all organizations
participating in and supporting the parade. Subsequent changes are announced at parade
briefings/practices. Immediately prior to the parade, military training leaders (MTL) and first
sergeants will inspect their personnel ensuring dress and personal appearance standards are met.
7.4.1.3. (Added) On the date of the ceremony, the post times are as follows:
7.4.1.3.1. (Added) The American flags must be in place surrounding the parade field no later
than 35 minutes prior to Adjutant’s Call.
7.4.1.3.2. (Added) All participating units will be on the ready line no earlier than 25 minutes
and no later than 15 minutes prior to Adjutant’s Call. Except for the colors, color escort mass
and the state flag mass, commanders will not march their troops in front of the ready line when
positioning on the parade field. Colors and escort mass will take position on the east side of the
parade field. The state flag mass will position on the final line.
7.4.1.3.3. (Added) The commander of troops (COT), group commanders and their staffs will
position on their markers ten minutes prior to Adjutant’s Call.
7.4.2.1. (Added) Each mass consists of a six-element front and is eight ranks deep. Smaller
units, e.g., the Marine Corps and Navy masses, may participate with a formation reduced to a
front of three and any depth down to six. Adjust staff positions accordingly.
7.4.2.2. (Added) Four groups will participate with four squadrons each, for a total of sixteen
squadrons.
7.4.4.1. (Added) 81 TRG/CC or designee appoints the COT, alternate COT, group commanders
and their respective staffs. The 81 TRG/MTO will notify alternates if the primary COT, or any
of his/her staff, cannot perform their duties.
