1. Effective management of civilian personnel resources within the budget is critical for sustaining air
and space forces to support national security objectives. This directive establishes policies for effective
management and mobilization of civilian resources.

2. The Air Force will manage its civilian personnel to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified
employees are available to meet worldwide mission requirements during periods of national emergency,
mobilization, war, military crisis, or other contingency.

3. In managing civilian personnel resources, the Air Force will stay within its civilian pay budget by bal-
ancing economy and efficiency of operations; position structures, skills, and career paths; employee
development and motivation; and recruitment and retention of competent personnel.

4. The Air Force supports the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work through proper, timely,
and accurate classification of positions; development of occupational skills codes; and timely address of
any employee dissatisfactions over classification of positions.

5. This directive establishes the following authorities and responsibilities:
   5.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Envi-
   ronment (SAF/MI) is responsible for civilian personnel policy matters as described in Air Force Pol-
   icy Directive 90-1, Strategic Planning and Policy Formulation, paragraph 1.5.2. SAF/MI approval is
   required before this document is changed, reissued, or rescinded.
   5.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (HQ USAF/DP) develops, coordinates, and executes per-
   sonnel policy and approves essential procedural guidance for the management of the Civilian Person-
   nel Resource Management Program.
   5.3. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, the Air Force Director of Programs and Evaluation, and
   the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller) jointly develop,
   defend, and coordinate civilian personnel funding and utilization; allocate manpower resources; and
   forecast, execute, and adjust civilian personnel budgets in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense
   and the Office of Management and Budget.

6. See Attachment 1 for measures used to comply with this policy.

7. See Attachment 2 for governing policies and directives implemented by this policy directive and
other publications with which it interfaces.

                           MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Compliance with civilian human resource management policies will be assessed by measuring exe-
cution of civilian resources against civilian employment plans and by measuring classification accuracy
and the ability to meet mission requirements during periods of national emergency. Measurement of
resource management will be done by Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) through execution reviews
and through internal self-assessment. Measurement of classification and mission requirements during
periods of national emergency will be done by the HQ USAF Quality Assessment Team, in an oversight
capacity, through internal self-assessment and quality assessment.
   A1.1.1. Execution of Civilian Employment Plan (CEP). Air Force managers are responsible for
   developing plans to execute civilian pay dollars, for implementing those plans, and for making appro-
   priate adjustments to those plans as changes in funding and employment needs occur. The policies to
   manage civilian personnel resources within the civilian pay budget and to ensure sufficient qualified
   employees will be measured by comparing workyear execution to workyear plans submitted and
   updated by the major commands and field operating agencies (Figure A1.4.).
   A1.1.2. Personnel Management (Position Description [PD] Accuracy). Air Force managers, nor-
   mally first-line supervisors, are responsible for the correct identification of duties and responsibilities
   which are written into PDs and for ensuring that those are the duties actually accomplished by
   employees. Employeesâ€™ qualifications for positions and resulting salaries are based on position classi-
   fications. Therefore, the policy to accurately assign duties and responsibilities will be measured by
   comparing information drawn from randomly sampled onsight interviews of actual performance to
   current PDs on file in the civilian personnel flight (Figure A1.1.). Measurements will be converted to
   percentages and compared with the Air Force standard of 90-percent accuracy.
   A1.1.3. Personnel Administration (Classification Accuracy). The civilian personnel flight is
   responsible for the accurate classification of PDs, including the establishment of title, series, and
   grade. The policy to accurately classify positions will be measured by comparing a random sample of
   PDs to results of onsite interviews of actual performance and to Office of Personnel Management and
   appropriate Air Force and DoD classification criteria (Figure A1.2.). Measurements will be con-
   verted to percentages and compared with the Air Force standard of 95-percent accuracy.
   A1.1.4. Mobilization Planning (Bases With Mobilization Plans). The policy to manage civilian
   personnel to meet worldwide mission requirements will be measured using comprehensive installa-
   tion plans for managing civilian personnel during periods of national emergency, mobilization, war,
   military crisis, and other contingencies (Figure A1.3.). The plans, which are approved by installation
   commanders: (1) identify civilian employees needed to meet US and oversea mission requirements;
   (2) identify key employees; (3) identify the military mobilization obligation of civilian employees; (4)
   document removal of key and emergency-essential employees from military mobilization obligation;
   and (5) identify skills shortfalls and shortfall resolutions.
