                                             Chapter 1

           FORCE DEVELOPMENT (FD) AND CAREER MANAGEMENT (CM)

1.1. Overvie w. FD is the career- long pursuit of education, training, experiences, and
assignments that produce Citizen Airmen who possess the requisite skills, knowledge, and
motivation to lead and execute the full spectrum of Air Force/Air Force Reserve missions. FD is
dynamic and deliberate by design which provides for the on- going growth of Citizen Airmen at
all levels. Each Citizen Airman is encouraged to seek out opportunities and experiences to
remain professionally relevant throughout the course of their career. Deliberate FD provides the
road map and focus for Air Force Reserve career development, building appropriate capabilities
for senior leaders to ascend to General Officer (GO), Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) or Senior
Executive Service (SES) echelons. Air Force Reserve CM is a unique and tailored career
planning process designed to meet the needs of the Air Force Reserve within the context of the
Citizen Airmen culture. CM develops Citizen Airmen to lead at all levels (tactical, operational
and strategic) and execute current and future mission capabilities. While many processes
outlined in this AFRCI are specific to officers, as the AFR FD initiative evolves, responsibilities
will be applicable to the enlisted grades and civilian workforce.
1.2. Force Development. The vision for Air Force Reserve FD, as an element of Total Force
Development, is to create an Air Force Reserve that is responsive to Air Force requirements and
managed as an integral part of the Total Force. The goal is to produce Citizen Airmen who
possess the tactical expertise, operational competence, and strategic vision to lead and execute
the full spectrum of Air Force missions. The execution of FD will:
     1.2.1. Maximize capabilities of all Citizen Airmen to ensure the Air Force Reserve
     Command (AFRC) can provide the right leader at the right time for air, space and cyberspace
     power in support of Air Force requirements.
     1.2.2. Ensure opportunities and expectations are transparent, providing visibility to all
     Citizen Airmen.
     1.2.3. Develop a pool of qualified candidates for strategic senior leadership positions within
     the Air Force Reserve through a deliberate assignment process.
     1.2.4. Deliberately connect all education, training and experience opportunities—to include
     assignments/deployments—to best leverage the Continuum of Learning that builds and
     enhances institutional and occupational competencies that meet Air Force Reserve needs in
     and across career fields.
     1.2.5. Create standardization to the fullest extent possible among all career fields to ensure a
     consistent FD program for the Air Force Reserve.
     1.2.6. Enhance Citizen Airmen understanding of their role in FD, using their inputs
     regarding desires within developmental education, professional military education and future
     assignment opportunities, and provide feedback to inform and shape expectations.
     1.2.7. Leverage information technology to provide useful tools to facilitate/enhance
     personnel decision processes and to maximize the capabilities of all Citizen Airmen.
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   5


   1.2.8. Prepare Citizen Airmen for the challenges of the Air, Space, and Cyberspace force.
   The methods applied to the force may differ slightly by career field as developmental
   methods are tailored to suit the availability of Citizen Airmen.
1.3. Career Management. Executing CM is a Reserve process under the FD umbrella to tailor
careers within the Citizen Airmen construct. While active component assignments are deliberate
and normally term- limited, most Reserve assignments are not. It is imperative for Citizen
Airmen to gain depth in their career field; providing a solid foundation of development. To
meet the needs of Total Force Development, the Reserve must ensure certain assignment
opportunities are deliberately managed and have standardized turnover. In addition to depth,
broadening through assignment above the wing level, also known as the “four pillars,” are
essential to developing our future force. The four pillars of Reserve strategic senior leader
development are assignments/tours in: Command; Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL)
positions; National Capital Region; and higher headquarters (above wing).
   1.3.1. Identified Key, Command and JDAL (K/C/J) positions that make up the K/C/J unit
   career management product will be managed by the command and the appropriate career
   field manager. Each CFM must review their career field K/C/J annually to determine if
   changes are required. Along with the CFM, senior leaders in each career field determine the
   “key” and “command” positions within their career field which would provide the
   experiences necessary to develop Citizen Airmen and equip them with the right capabilities
   to potentially become strategic senior leaders within the AFR. JDAL positions are
   determined by the joint staff and are considered key experiences for development.
   1.3.2. Assignments into a K/C/J position will have established tour lengths and focused
   rotational turnover for the identified K/C/J positions (see para 5.2). This focused turnover
   ensures the required breadth on top of the depth reservists obtain within their core Air Force
   Specialty. The combination of depth and breadth in education, training, and experience will
   ensure the Air Force Reserve has Citizen Airmen ready to take leadership roles at the
   strategic/enterprise (component) levels in the Air Force Reserve, Air Force or Department of
   Defense. Attaining overall FD goals requires Reserve CM to achieve the following
   objectives:
   1.3.3. Deliberately connect individual Citizen Airmen education, training, and experience
   opportunities to best build competencies that meet Reserve needs within career fields.
   1.3.4. Ensure the Air Force Reserve invests the right education, training, and experience in
   the right individual at the right time within the Citizen Airmen construct by developing
   personnel processes and utilizing competitive selection, to support this objective.
   1.3.5. Enhance Citizen Airmen’s, Supervisors’, and Commanders’ understanding of their
   roles in managing reserve careers through the Development Team (DT) process and provide
   feedback to inform and shape individual expectations.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities. All supervisors, commanders, and leaders must encourage
Citizen Airmen to fully participate in the voluntary aspects of CM. Specific responsibilities
include the following:
   1.4.1. AF/REG. AF/REG is the Air Force Reserve Air Staff directorate established to
   manage Air Force Reserve general officers, O-6s assigned to general officer positions, and
   O-6s who are deliberately managed in K/C/J positions. AF/REG serves as the administrative
6                                                        AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


    lead for Reserve Command Screening Board (RCSB) and Reserve Brigadier General
    Qualification Board (RBGQB) for eligible Reserve officers. In addition, they are the conduit
    for specific senior enlisted assignments.        The Senior Enlisted Management Office
    (AF/REGE) is the administrative lead for assignment facilitation of active, reserve, and DoD
    senior enlisted nominative positions, as well as E-9 positions MAJCOM and above. Eligible
    candidates for K/C/J positions include individuals listed on DT HPO rosters, sitting
    commanders, RCSB, and RBGQB selects.
    1.4.2. AF/REP. AF/REP provides strategic direction, policy development/oversight and
    legislative interpretation for Career Management and Force Development programs.
    1.4.3. AF/REX. AF/REX is the authority on Air Force Reserve manpower, resource,
    programming and management.
    1.4.4. AF/JA. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) is solely responsible for the career
    management of the entire JA career field across all components, to include the Air Force
    Reserve IAW 10 U.S.C. §§ 806, 8037, AFI 51-801, Training of Air Force Reserve
    Component Judge Advocates and Paralegals, and AFI 51-80, Management of the Judge
    Advocate General’s Corps Reserve. This AFRCI will provide general guidance, but JA CM
    and FD will be conducted at the direction of TJAG.
    1.4.5. AF/HC. The Air Force Chief of C haplains (AF/HC) is responsible for the career
    management of the entire HC career field across all components, to include the Air Force
    Reserve, IAW 10 U.S.C. § 8067, DoDI 1304.28, Guidance for the Appointment of Chaplains

    implements policy for the overall CM and FD programs, in conjunction, with the Directorate
    for Personnel of the Office of the Chief of the Air Force Reserve (AF/REP), Readiness
    Management Group (RMG) and the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC). HQ AFRC/A1
    directs programs that provide information, guidance, and opportunities for Citizen Airmen to
    serve a rewarding career. Within HQ AFRC/A1, the following organizations have unique

          monitored.
          1.4.7.2.11. Assist CFM’s with maintaining a Potential Reassignment List (PRL)
          (officers only) and notifying those officers NLT 6 months prior to expiration, whose
          term limit is about to expire. A/Fs will assist members with their reassignment.
          1.4.7.2.12. Provide CFM with list of new promotes, RDEDB selections, and RSSB
          selections, and may upon request by the CFM draft a congratulatory email to send to
          the member.
       1.4.7.3. Board Operations: Responsible for building each career field database prior to
       the DT to include standardized filters and vectors along with career field specific filters

  CFM/MFM on all force development manpower changes and actions.
  1.4.10. Reserve Functional Manager (RFM). Are senior leaders within a career field
  appointed by the AFRC/CC. The RFM provides day-to-day strategic- level direction and
  authority over specific functional communities requirements and overall management of a
  functional career field. While they should maintain an institutional focus with regard to
  resource development and distribution, RFMs are responsible for ensuring their specialties
  are equipped, developed, and sustained to provide AF capabilities. HQ AFRC full-time
  directors fulfill the role of RFM to ensure day-to-day consistency and continuity. They must
  appoint a Career Field Manager (CFM) and MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) (there
  will be instances where the RFM and CFM are the same) in writing to HQ AFRC/A1, with
  notification to ARPC/DPA.
  1.4.11. Career Field Manager (CFM–officer)/MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM–
  enlisted). The CFM is appointed by the RFM on behalf of the AFRC/CC and represents a
  single functional family. A CFM may be responsible for more than one specialty or multiple
  CFMs may be appointed within a single career field. MFMs are appointed by the RFM and
  are responsible for the management of designated enlisted career fields. The CFMs/MFMs
  provide strategic-level direction and are the overall authority on behalf of the RFM for
  Reserve AFSC-specific requirements and serves as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for career
  field specific guidance. They monitor the health and manning of their career fields and
  elevate concerns to RFMs. They manage command training for their career field and
  disseminate career field policies and program requirements throughout the command. HQ
  AFRC/A1K will maintain a current list of CFMs/MFMs. CFMs must be an O-6 or
  equivalent for officers and MFMs must be an E-9 for enlisted (waivers must be approved by
  the owning RFM). AFI 36-2640, Executing Total Force Development and AFI 36-2618, The
  Enlisted Force Structure govern CFMs and MFMs. Specific responsibilities include but are
  not limited to:

         1.4.11.3.4. Ensure Career Path Guidance (CPG) is reviewed and modified, as
         appropriate, during the DT.
10                                                      AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


         1.4.11.3.5. Provide ARPC/DPA, or designated representative, any career field-
         specific guidance for DT panel members, including but not limited to AFSC-specific
         filters.
         1.4.11.3.6. Ensure vectors are returned to ARPC/DPA for distribution to the career
         field in a timely manner (see Table 2.1).
         1.4.11.3.7. Ensure Developmental Team Charter Guidelines (Attachment 6) are
         developed and/or reviewed annually in conjunction with career field DT.
     1.4.11.4. Participates in AFR Career Field Managers’ Forum.
     1.4.11.5. Must review their career field K/C/J annually to determine if changes are
     required. Along with the CFM, senior leaders in each career field determine the “key”
     positions within their career field which will provide the experiences necessary to
     develop Citizen Airmen and equip them with the right capabilities to potentially become
     strategic senior leaders within the AFR. All identified key positions must be vetted
     through the appropriate organizations to the AFRC/CC for final approval via the
     appropriate tasking tool.
     1.4.11.6. Must review their career field manning on a regular basis to ensure all funded
     positions are visible via the appropriate management tool (such as Reserve Management
     Vacancy System) allowing Citizen Airmen to understand opportunities within every
     career field.
     1.4.11.7. For Professional Specialties: Reviews and validates advanced academic
     requirements, as well as other professional continuing education required to meet AF
     requirements.
     1.4.11.8. In coordination with the appropriate assignment organization (AF/REG/REGE
     or ARPC/DPA) provides hiring official with a prioritized short list of qualified candidates

     1.4.11.9. If desired, CFM may request a waiver to the standardized filters. Waiver must
     be coordinated through ARPC chain of command then submitted to HQ AFRC/A1KO.
     At a minimum waiver must be staffed through HQ AFRC/A1K, HQ AFRC/A1, HQ
     AFRC/DSK, and HQ AFRC/DS to AFRC/CV for approval. . Reques t must be approved
     and forwarded to ARPC NLT 120 days prior to the DT start date.
  1.4.12. Functional Area Manager (FAM). The FAM is appointed by the CFM on behalf
  of the RFM and should be the most highly knowledgeable and experienced person wit hin the
  functional area and have the widest range of visibility over functional area readiness and
  capability issues. FAMs are accountable for the management and oversight of all personnel
  and equipment within a specific functional area to support operational planning and
  execution. Responsibilities may include, but not limited to:

AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 11


  1.4.13. Commanders and Other Leaders. Commanders, Command Chiefs, Superintendents,
  Supervisors/Raters, Program Managers, CFMs, MFMs, and senior Citizen Airmen play a
  vital role in FD. Each (whether reserve, active duty or civilian) should understand and be
  committed to Total Force Development. Individual assessment, mentorship, and feedback
  are essential elements in achieving a well- rounded workforce. Leaders will:
     1.4.13.1. Ensure that each Citizen Airman receives tactical level mentoring to reach the ir
     full potential.
     1.4.13.2. Educate, coach, and encourage individuals to participate fully in the FD
     process.
     1.4.13.3. Understand the Air Force Reserve FD process, as well as the respective FD
     requirements and career path for the various functional communities.
     1.4.13.4. Assist Citizen Airmen in assessing and fulfilling their developmental objectives
     and career goals utilizing tools such as career planning guides and individual ribbon
     charts.
     1.4.13.5. If a Citizen Airman submits a R-DP, carefully consider his/her potential and
     provide honest assessment on the R-DP. This feedback should occur both before the
     development plan is submitted and after it has been reviewed by the DT (DTs balance the
     desires of the individual with the mission needs of the Air Force Reserve; therefore, the
     career vectors may not match individual desires).
  1.4.14. Mentor. Citizen Airmen may seek informal, private communication between
  themselves and a mentor either in or outside their rating chain. The mentor’s responsibility
  does not differ significantly from that of Commanders and other leaders.
  1.4.15. Individual. Every year each Citizen Airman is responsible for determining his/her
  availability for development opportunities. It is incumbent upon each individual to learn
  about FD and CM processes, seek guidance from leaders and other mentors and determine
  goals/desires for their own development. The R-DP is then the tool to communicate their
  choice regarding their level of FD participation. Officers complete the Reserve-Officer
  Development Plan (R-ODP) and enlisted complete the Reserve-Enlisted Development Plan
  (R-EDP) located on vPC-GR. Civilians (includes ARTs) complete the Airman Development
  Plan located on the Air Force Personnel Center’s webpage. Citizen Airmen may choose not
  to volunteer to participate in the formal FD process for any cycle with the understanding that
  they may miss out on education, training, and career guidance from career field senior
  leaders. Officers will be offered a choice of deliberate management (DM) or voluntary
  assignments (VA). They will identify their choice ontheir R-ODP.
     1.4.15.1. Deliberate Management—member agrees to allow the command to map their
     career and make deliberate assignments based on the needs of the Air Force Reserve
     utilizing vectors and assignment recommendations from the DT. NOTE: Not everyone
     who selects DM will be deliberately managed.
     1.4.15.2. Voluntary Assignments—member manages their own career with vectors
     provided by the DT, the supervisory chain and the unit commander.
     1.4.15.3. When possible, final submission of R-DP is through the first O-6 or higher, or
     equivalent, in the rating chain. A squadron commander (at any level) or Program
 12                                                        AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


       Manager is the alternative to the first O-6 or higher in the rating chain. Enlisted members
       must include their organizational Command Chief or Superintendent.
       1.4.15.4. The failure to update/submit a R-DP removes Citizen Airmen from
       consideration for that cycle (DT to DT). As a result, it may reduce opportunities.
       Individuals who choose voluntary assignments and/or who do not submit/update an R-DP
       for multiple years will be assessed by their DT every third year.
1.5. Officer Force Development (OFD). Tactical, operational and strategic level opportunities
are common to all career fields. Officers must establish a solid grounding at the tactical and
operational levels in a primary career field. At the field grade level reserve officers should
explore gaining breadth of experience via assignments, experience, education and training.
While a majority of officers will choose to remain at the tactical/operational level providing
depth of expertise and leadership in a particular field, it is imperative tha t some continue to
increase their development at the more strategic levels. A small percentage of officers across
career fields will be deliberately assigned into positions with levels of responsibility and
leadership at the higher end of the operational arena and strategic level. These individuals will
have increased opportunities for breadth of experience within DoD, Air Force, Air Reserve
Component (ARC) and joint levels.
   1.5.1. Officer career paths have historically been depicted in pyramids, indicating upward
   progression and implying fewer types of jobs exist at senior levels. Under FD, these
   pyramids are called Career Planning Guides (CPGs). ( Attachment 2). CPGs provide an
   overview of professional development throughout an officer’s care er and a general career
   model with specific details for each Air Force specialty.
   1.5.2. The CPG reinforces the fact that there is no “set path” to senior leadership, but there
   are fundamental building blocks—or pillars (see para 1.3).
   1.5.3. The CPG reflects DE opportunities. DE opportunities include both appropriate level
   military education and specialized education that develop officers either within their career
   field or prepare them for an assignment outside of their core career field.
1.6. Enlisted Force Development (EFD). The focus of EFD is to develop enlisted Airmen by
integrating skills, abilities, goals and desires with the needs of the AFRC in correlation with AFI
36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure. EFD provides deliberate and organized career
development initiatives while maintaining the Citizen Airmen culture and the integrity of all
reserve categories. These initiatives coincide with education, training, and experience to meet
the operational and strategic challenges of the AFR. HQ AFRC/CCC will oversee the EFD
program through HQ AFRC/A1. HQ AFRC/A1K will manage the EFD program. AF/REGE
will manage the senior enlisted nominative positions process. AF/REP will coordinate with
AF/A1D ensuring AF Reserve requirements are considered when Air Force policy is written or
changed and in coordination with HQ AFRC/A1, will author the necessary policy guidance for
the AFR. Senior leaders must be committed to developing the enlisted force utilizing a qualified
candidate pool to meet current and future leadership requirements through robust assessment,
mentorship, and feedback. Senior leaders are also entrusted to educate, mentor, and encourage
Citizen Airmen to fully participate in the FD process.
   1.6.1. Enlisted Citizen Airmen should make a strong personal commitment toward
   professional and personal development beyond formal schools offered. They should also
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  13


   embrace responsibility for ensuring continued growth for themselves and others so they are
   ready for the next level. (Attachment 3).
       1.6.1.1. MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM) will appoint Air Force Career Specialty
       SMEs for their respective career fields. Each SME will research and identify their
       professional developmental opportunities beyond the formal Air Force schools and will
       maintain a complete list of all educational opportunities and provide it to Citizen Airmen
       at all levels.
       1.6.1.2. MFMs maintain the list of K/J positions and review projected vacancies to
       ensure appropriate placement of individuals. MFMs and/or AF/REGE work with hiring
       authorities and senior leadership to evaluate candidates and make assignment
       recommendations.
       1.6.1.3. AF/REGE will manage AGR and IMA K/J positions at the MAJCOM level and
       above. In coordination with MFMs, AFRC/CCC, AF/RE and AFRC/CC, AF/REGE will
       deliberately manage personnel included on the yearly KPL as well as those currently
       residing in a K/J position. Incumbents in K/J positions not selected to the KPL should
       strive to complete the necessary requirements, increasing the likelihood for selection to
       positions of greater responsibility
   1.6.2. The E-8/E-9 DT will be held at ARPC to review records and the R-DP for SMSgts
   and CMSgts across the command. It is the member’s responsibility to ensure his/her desires
   and goals are identified on his/her R-EDP when submitted to ARPC by the established
   deadline.
   1.6.3. Wings and Groups may hold local DTs to review E-6 and below records. The EFD
   process is to ensure Citizen Airmen at all levels receive feedback and guidance in a
   deliberate and organized method. The primary point of contact will be the Wing Command
   Chief or the Group Superintendent working with HQ AFRC/A1KO.
   1.6.4. Enlisted Functional Development Teams. DTs will be held biennially for each
   enlisted career field to review E-7 and below records; however, smaller career fields may
   review E-6 and below records during the DT with HQ AFRC/A1KO approval. Typically,
   MFMs will hold DTs at ARPC; smaller career fields (< 200 records) may request to hold
   their DT at HQ AFRC (see para 2.4.8).
   1.6.5. Reserve Enlisted Force Development Panel (REFDP). The REFDP provides
   oversight, takes action and makes recommendations on the deliberate development and
   utilization of enlisted Citizen Airman. REFDP membership and guidelines are outlined in
   the REFDP Charter. The panel is chaired by HQ AFRC/CCC and co-chaired by the Chief of
   Enlisted Force Development (HQ AFRC/A1KO). The REFDP will meet three times per year
   at various venues with additional meetings requested by the chair.
1.7. Civilian Force Development (CFD). To meet new challenges, the Air Force must posture
the Total Force team and increasingly rely on its robust civilian workforce. As the
responsibilities of our civilian workforce have increased, so has the need for intentional CFD.
CFD allows civilians to develop depth and breadth of experience to assume operational and
strategic responsibilities. This focus allows us to build leaders who can meet emerging and
future challenges. ( Attachment 4). AFRC is unique in that the command has not only Title V
civilians but also Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs). Accordingly, all supervisors will provide
 14                                                        AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


equal emphasis on military and civilian DE to include explanation of application processes per
AFMAN 36-606, Civilian Career Field Management and Development. Supervisors should
further provide information on developmental and upward mobility opportunities. While many
processes outlined in this AFRCI are specific to officers and enlisted personnel, a comparable
FD program will be established for the AFR civilian workforce (to include ARTs).
   1.7.1. There are three foundational programs tailored for the development of the civilian
   force:
       1.7.1.1. The mandatory New Employee Orientation training provides new Air Force
       civilians basic Air Force knowledge, including heritage, core competencies, customs,
       courtesies and core values.
       1.7.1.2. The second program, continuous self-development, encourages self- initiated
       personal and professional development through a variety of learning venues and self-
       development tools.
       1.7.1.3. The third program, non-resident DE, establishes an expectation to complete DE
       specifically targeted at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.
       1.7.1.4. Civilian Acculturation and Leadership Training, is an officer training school- like
       leadership experience that focuses on communication, followership, and institutional
       competencies at the personal and team levels. This is a key development training
       opportunity for select civilians.
       1.7.1.5. The annual call for Civilian Developmental Education (CDE) nomination takes
       place the second quarter of the FY with nominations due early May to AFPC/DPIFDA.
       DT vectoring follows the nominations with the CDE Selection Board in early September,
       the Developmental Education Designation Board in October, and the designation
       announcement release in October/November.
   1.7.2. Supervisors play a vital role in CFD. Using the appropriate career field development
   templates and career planning guides provided by AFPC, supervisors and mentors will assist
   employees in making an informed career choice by educating the individual on what various
   career choices entail in terms of time, commitment, mobility, etc. Supervisors will
   encourage individuals to participate in this process and be the primary means by which
   feedback is delivered to the individual. The functional community plays an important role in
   the CDE selection process. Through the involvement of the career field DT hosted at AFPC,
   the career field will proactively engage those employees who should apply, rack and stack
   those employees, and provide meaningful assignments upon graduation or completion of
   training.
   1.7.3. Experiential development is a critical part of implementing CFD. Developmental
   positions are needed for broadening, staff experience and leadership development.
       1.7.3.1. Centrally- managed positions are used when maximum flexibility is required, or
       when development needs to span multiple levels of control. Career broadening,
       residential development education billets and program outplacement, and force
       management fall into this category. These positions have a specified term.
       1.7.3.2. Key leadership developmental positions build leadership experience at the
       operational and strategic levels. While limited in tenure, they require our best leaders at a
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  15


       given level, and are ideal for building enduring competencies that will be required at the
       next higher level.
1.8. Career Management Board (CMB). The CMB approves and provides overall policy

                                           Chapter 2

                               DEVELOPMENT TEAM (DT)

2.1. Overvie w. The Career Field Manager (CFM - Officer) and MAJCOM Functional Manager
(MFM - Enlisted) administer the Force Development (FD) and Career Management (CM)
objectives through the DTs. The Reserve-Development Plan (R-DP) is the avenue in which
Citizen Airmen communicate their desire for development. The DTs utilize the R-DP to link the
Airman’s desires, potential for leadership, education, training, and experienceswith the needs of
the AFR.
   2.1.1. DTs play a critical role in developing officers, enlisted, and civilians to support
   current and projected mission capabilities. One important purpose of the DTs is to allow
   career field leaders the opportunity to assess their human capital inventory. DTs provide data
   which must be used for developmental processes—deliberate/specific developmental
   education recommendations, assignments, etc. For individual Citizen Airmen, DTs provide
   guidance on continuing education, training and experience opportunities.
2.2. Reserve-Development Plan Guidance: The R-DP is the ultimate tool for Citizen Airmen
to influence the development of their own careers based on their life events and c ivilian
experiences. Officers complete the Reserve-Officer Development Plan (R-ODP), enlisted
complete the Reserve-Enlisted Development Plan (R-EDP), and civilians (include ARTs)
complete the Airman Development Plan via a link on the Air Force Personnel Center’s webpage.
Each year the DTs begin a new cycle. The cycle provides Citizen Airmen with a fresh venue
each year to update their goals and/or restrictions. Each individual should communicate their
personal desires for that year to help DTs determine the most appropriate career opportunities.
While individuals should take advantage of this “refresh” opportunity to best meet both personal
and professional needs, each should recognize that there are limitations when development has
been idle for an extended period. The entire FD process hinges on this important document to
match individual preference to the needs of the Air Force Reserve.
   2.2.1. The R-DP is located within vPC-GR through the My Personnel System (MyPERS).
   At a minimum, the R-DP should be initiated/updated 45 days prior to the scheduled DT and
   forwarded to the member’s appropriate coordinator in the rating chain. The A/F will send
   reminder e- mails for R-DP updates to the appropriate population NLT 120 days prior to the
   DT. Failure to complete the R-DP during the prescribed timeline will result in the filtering
   out of the member’s records during the DT; member will not be scored or vectored during
   that annual cycle.
   2.2.2. Citizen Airmen should clearly communicate their career goals in the R-DP. Goals are
   divided as near-, mid- and long-term. A well-communicated goal should indicate desire for
   in-residence education, change of assignment (Location/Status), command, JDAL, or other
   key developmental opportunities.
       2.2.2.1. For example (officer): Near-Term Goal: Finish Air Command and Staff
       College (ACSC) by correspondence. While finishing ACSC, stay in current assignment.
       Mid-Term Goal: Seek broadening opportunity at above wing level or joint with the goal
       of returning to unit in no more than three years.Long-term goal: Compete for squadron
       command.
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               17


      2.2.2.2. For example (enlisted): Near-Term Goal: Finish senior enlisted PME. Mid-
      Term Goal: Apply to Enlisted Development Education Board (EDEB) for consideration
      to attend advanced developmental education courses such as Gettysburg or Reserve
      Component National Security Course. Long-Term Goal: Become Wing/NAF/AFRC
      Command Chief.
   2.2.3. Impact of R-DP: Due to the Citizen Airmen construct, DTs understand that not all
   Citizen Airmen desire to be deliberately managed. The R-DP is the main FD tool that allows
   functional managers and other senior leaders to assess an individual’s career path and plan
   for future opportunities. DTs can provide a range of senior leadership recommendations
   based on the Citizen Airmen’s R-DP input.
   2.2.4. R-DP Utilization. Any/all portions of the R-DP—individual’s input, senior leader
   endorsement and DT feedback—may be made available to school boards, career
   management boards, command screening boards, etc.
2.3. Developmental Team Membership.
   2.3.1. DT Chair for officer DTs. The CFM normally chairs the DT, however, variations are
   authorized. The DT Charter reflects the DT Chair and membership (Attachment 6). If the
   RFM determines someone other than the CFM will act as the DT Chair, they shall provide
   the name and justification to HQ AFRC/A1K and notify ARPC/DPA. Ideally, a general
   officer or SES will serve as chair to the DT.
   2.3.2. DT Chair for enlisted DTs. The AFRC/CV or designated representative will act as
   Senior Advisor and the AFRC/CCC or designated representative will chair the leadership DT
   for E-9s and E-8s in the command.
   2.3.3. Functional DT Membership. DT composition will be determined by the CFM/MFM.
   In addition to the DT Chair, voting members of the DT may include key FD stakeholders
   such as senior leadership from the functional community that best represents the considered
   population. When possible all Air Reserve Forces Identifiers (ARF-ID) participation
   categories should be included in the DT composition. The DT may include subject matter
   experts, observers, or action officers, as required, and all DT members should serve in a
   grade/position consistent with the required developmental decisions.
      2.3.3.1. The CFM/MFM may also choose to include members of the Active Component
      and/or ANG, as well as sitting NAF/CCs, wing commanders/directors/group
      commanders, command chiefs, and other designated key personnel as voting members.
      DTs should ideally have no more than 50 percent turnover of members from one DT to
      the next. DTs also have a variety of representatives from the CFMs, Assignment
      Facilitator (A/F), subject matter experts, or career teams (designated by the CFM/MFM)
      and/or civilian career field teams (designated by HQ AFRC/A1C) as appropriate, to
      ensure standardization and provide administrative and logistical support. The basic
      design involves a panel chair (ideally an O-7 or above for officer DTs; E-9 for enlisted
      DTs), the CFM/MFM, senior level panel members, and an action officer. This construct
      is replicated depending on the overall workload and DT member availability.
   2.3.4. Enlisted Leadership (E-9/E-8) DT Board Membership. The DT Chair determines
   board composition for all SMSgt and CMSgt DTs. In addition to the DT Chair, voting
   members of the DT may include key CMSgt FD stakeholders from across the command and
 18                                                       AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


   should be on the KPL. When possible all ARF-ID participation categories should be
   included in the DT board member composition. The DT chair may also choose to include
   members of the Active Component and/or ANG. This construct is replicated depending on
   the overall workload and DT member availability.
2.4. Development Team Responsibilities.
   2.4.1. DTs identify the education, training, and experiences appropriate for Citizen Airmen
   within each functional community based on current and future requirements. This includes
   education and training opportunities funded by the Air Force or pursued as self-development
   by all Citizen Airmen. DTs provide feedback to CFMs/MFMs and update Career Planning
   Guides (CPG) as necessary.
   2.4.2. DTs should understand career field policies, plans, programs, training, and actions
   affecting career field management and development when making decisions and provide
   actionable vectors. DTs also take into consideration the valued skills acquired through years
   of experience in his/her core AFSC, civilian experiences, and career broadening in a non-
   core special duty. These experiences provide our future leaders with the critical thinking and
   problem solving skills required to make better informed decisions.
   2.4.3. Prior to career field DTs, an overview of existing and projected requirements should
   be accomplished by the CFM/MFM and A/F. Requirements include, but are not limited to
   vacancies/projected and deployment opportunities.
   2.4.4. DTs make vectors based on projected/anticipated, aggregated requirements by grade,
   level and position type. A vector is the DT’s collective recommendation for an experience
   level, training or education opportunity, or position type. A member can be vectored for
   recommendations for next or subsequent assignments and/o r career broadening
   developmental assignments. Standardized vectors are utilized for all career fields to allow
   for post-DT metrics. Additional career field specific vectors may be added.
      2.4.4.1. A/F will conduct telecon with key players (CFM, MFM, DPAF, Board
      Operations) to review potential eligible pool to discus filter waiver impact 151 days prior
      to the DT. If CFM desires a change to the standardized filters he/she must submit a
      waiver to the standardized filters. Waiver must be coordinated through ARPC chain of
      command then submitted to HQ AFRC/A1KO to route appropriate coordination to
      AFRC/CV for approval. Request must be approved and forwarded to ARPC NLT 120
      days prior to the DT start date.
   2.4.5. Each DT is responsible for reviewing the CPG for their respective career field and
   then modifying as appropriate. The modified CPGs illustrate development levels and
   corresponding windows of opportunity for education and training to help focus Citizen
   Airmen’s expectations and give them a better roadmap. DTs use CPGs to make informed
   vector recommendations and assist CFMs/MFMs with updating this guidance based on
   career field dynamics as well as current and projected personnel requirements.
   (Attachments 2, 3, and 4).
   2.4.6. DTs can consider cross-functional development and utilization requirements when
   vectoring Citizen Airmen. Cross-functional OPRs will identify their requirements to
   CFMs/MFMs NLT 30 days prior to each scheduled DT session if career opportunities exist.
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   19


   2.4.7. ARPC/DPA works with the CFMs/MFMs and HQ AFRC/A1KO to develop the DT
   schedule. Dates are posted on the AFPERs Force Development website and other pertinent
   information areas.
   2.4.8. ARPC is responsible for execution and facilitation of pre-DT, DT, and post-DT
   events. DTs which require only one panel may be executed at HQ AFRC or AFPC.
   Requests to execute at a location other than ARPC must be staffed through HQ AFRC/A1K
   by June of calendar year prior to next DT cycle. Additional meetings outside of the DT (e.g.
   board of directors, executive working groups, conferences, briefings, etc.) is the sole
   responsibility of the visiting team. A minimum of one action officer (AO) per panel is
   required (recommended grades: O-3/O-4 for officer DTs; E1- E6 for enlisted DTs). Enlisted
   AOs are required in place one week prior to and for the duration of the DT.
   2.4.9. ARPC/DPA or designated representative notifies eligible members regarding their
   upcoming DT in accordance with pre-DT guidance. At a minimum, the message describes
   the purpose of the panel, necessary actions to take to review records and includes specific
   guidance from the CFM/MFM.
   2.4.10. To ensure consistency across career fields and grow a pool of competitive Citizen
   Airmen with capabilities to perform in tactical, operational and strategic environments
   standardized filters will be imposed. (Attachment 7) Individuals who have initiated/updated
   and submitted R-DP to their respective coordination chain will be scored and vectored if they
   pass eligibility requirements (filters), regardless of choosing to be considered for deliberate
   management or voluntary assignments. Some DTs may have additional filters unique to their
   career field. Citizen Airmen are encouraged to complete their R-DP by the respective DT
   suspense date.
   2.4.11. Vectoring Policy in Special Duty, Reporting Identifier, or Non-Core AFSCs. There
   is no central management system in place for Reservists, nor typical movement into/out of
   special duty/non-core AFSCs in the Reserve. Citizen Airmen may be vectored by both their
   primary career field’s DT and their Special Duty/Non-Core DT as long as they accomplish an
   R-DP and meet all the imposed filters. Members who are assigned to a special duty/non-core
   AFSC must accomplish a R-DP prior to both non-core and primary AFSC DT. If the R-DP
   is not accomplished prior to the DT, records will not be reviewed. CFMs and panel chairs
   much ensure officers working in a special duty/non-core AFSC receive vectors from their
   core career field DT if their record is part of the board once filters are imposed. Once the
   Reservist has been out of their core AFSC 7 years, they will not be looked at by the career
   field DT without a waiver approved by HQ AFRC/CV. For enlisted personnel AFI 36-2618,
   The Enlisted Force Structure, classifications thresholds will be followed. Vectoring will
   continue with the Special Duty/Non-Core DT.
2.5. Developmental Team Key Personnel List (KPL). DTs must establish a KPL by
reviewing and scoring Airmen records. Once scores are consolidated via the database, a natural
cut line is revealed. Through intentional discussion and review, the panel members validate the
cut. The KPL is comprised of High Potentials (HP), with in-resident DE recommendations. The
KPL is used to fill K/C/J positions and referenced when making other developmental/CM
decisions. HPs are maintained on key personnel listings broken out by grade. ARPC is
responsible for posting and maintaining the officer KPLs. All KPLs will be posted on a secure
site. AF/REGE is responsible for posting and maintaining the E-8 and E-9 KPLs. CFMs/MFMs
 20                                                       AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


are responsible for maintaining AFSC specific KPLs. NOTE: Stratifications on evaluation
reports (EPR/OPRs) regarding placement on KPLs and other Development Team vectors are
strictly prohibited per AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, para 3.7.20.
2.6. Developmental Team Operations. There are four distinct phases of DT operations:
Planning, Preparation, Execution and Post Execution. Open communication between the
CFM/MFM, HQ AFRC/A1K, AF/REP, and ARPC/DPA is essential to aid in planning DT
events and identify issues/potential conflicts discovered in relation to a DT event. HQ
AFRC/A1K should identify measurable data to be analyzed and tracked to ARPC/DPA.

                                           Chapter 3

                          DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION (DE)

3.1. Overvie w. Citizen Airmen should complete the appropriate level of DE/Professional
Military Education (PME) commensurate with their grade. Completion may be in-residence or
by correspondence, seminar, or distance learning in accordance with AFI 36-2254, V2, Reserve
Personnel Training. Enlisted personnel should complete the appropriate level for DE in
accordance with AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program. AFI 36-2301, Developmental
Education, contains DE eligibility criteria. All DE eligibility criteria will be outlined in the
specific central selection board invitation to apply. This chapter summarizes DE guidance in
AFI 36-2254 V2, Reserve Personnel Training.
   3.1.1. The norm for Citizen Airmen, and their Reserve leadership, is to expect to complete
   DE through non-resident methods.
   3.1.2. All Selected Reserve members are eligible for DE. In accordance with AFI 36-2254
   V2, Reserve Personnel Training, para 2.3.4.3, individuals on Limited Period Recall Program
   (LPRP) or Limited Extended Active Duty (LEAD) are not eligible and may not apply for in-
   residence DE. Exception: Prior to school start date, members who have an established tour
   end date and approved documentation (AF Form 1288) identifying a gain action to a
   SELRES position may apply for DE consideration.
   3.1.3. Citizen Airmen who attend DE in-residence must be in a military duty status to
   receive point credit for attendance. However, Air Reserve Technicians (ART) attending in
   civilian status and Title V civilians will receive credit as having completed resident DE once
   their military grade meets military grade criteria for enrollment/attendance for the respective
   level of DE. Civilian completion of DE for ARTs and Title V civilians will be masked in the
   promotion system if prior to obtaining prerequisite military grade.
   3.1.4. Completion of DE via any non-resident program will not affect eligibility for
   attendance in- residence.
   3.1.5. Non-completion or elimination from a DE School. When eliminating or disenrolling a
   Citizen Airmen from a DE school for any reason, the procedures outlined in the Education &
   Training Course Announcements apply.                The procedures are available at
   https://etca.randolph.af.mil. As a part of the outlined process, the school sends a copy of
   the faculty board proceedings to AF/REP, HQ AFRC/A1K, ARPC/DPA and the RMG.
   3.1.6. Developmental Education Attendance Agreement. Prior to attending the Reserve
   Developmental Education Designation Board (RDEDB) schools or select Enlisted
   Development Education Board (EDEB) courses, all Reserve attendees must sign a Student
   Attendance Agreement (Attachment 8). Failure to sign this agreement negates the Citizen
   Airmen’s opportunity to attend the respective DE in-residence course. This agreement is
   completed upon notification of selection and returned to ARPC/DPA within 30 days of
   public release.
   3.1.7. In-resident students (schools 90 days or more) must ensure their duty title is updated
   in MILPDS as: In-Resident Developmental Education Student when out-processing local
   military personnel squadron.
 22                                                       AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


   3.1.8. AF/REP and HQ AFRC/A1K obtain annual officer DE quotas from USAF/A1 or
   other venues as appropriate. Quotas are reviewed and forwarded to ARPC/DPA. HQ
   AFRC/CCC and HQ AFRC/A1K obtain annual enlisted DE quotas from AF/A1 or other
   venues as appropriate. Quotas are reviewed and forwarded to ARPC/DPA.
   3.1.9. Developmental Education Credit for Schools Attended/Completed in Other Services.
   AF Reserve members, who have not attended an AF recognized DE in-residence course may
   not register for another Service’s non-resident DE until they have completed the appropriate
   level of non-resident Air Force DE. Citizen Airmen accessed into the Air Force Reserve
   from other services receive creditable recognition for having completed DE in their former
   service. However, this recognition is only applicable for Intermediate Developmental
   Education (IDE) and Senior Developmental Education (SDE) for officers, and Senior Non-
   Commissioned Officer (SNCO) Academy for enlisted members transferred from the Army,
   Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard. Basic DE for company grade officers must be satisfied
   through Air Force Squadron Officer School (SOS), which is designated as Primary
   Developmental Education (PDE). See AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education, Chapter 3 for
   guidance on DE Credit.
       3.1.9.1. In-residence equivalency requests are considered during the RDEDB/EDEB for
       approval/disapproval. Written requests must be routed through the appropriate rating
       chain of command with recommendation for approval by the senior rater. Requests
       should contain all supporting documentation, course/start/completion dates, graduation
       certificate, proof of competitive selection to attend and the requests must identify
       program/course for which they are requesting credit.
3.2. Officer Developmental Education. As part of the Continuum of Learning officers
encounter throughout their career, DE provides a solid foundation of core knowledge regarding
specific skill sets or areas. The RDEDB is held once each calendar year and the RSSB is held
two times a calendar year. Courses identified in Tables 3.1 – 3.5 may not be available on each
board due to quotas, new or deleted courses, and course date changes. The current invitation to
apply will identify relevant courses for the current board.
   3.2.1. Under the Force Development construct, officers are developed for leadership and
   command responsibilities. Limited opportunities may restrict DE in-residence attendance;
   therefore, all officers should complete non-resident DE.
   3.2.2. In-residence DE graduates who were identified by their respective DT for in-residence
   DE will be given priority consideration for appropriate follow-on assignments to ensure
   return on investment for the Air Force Reserve. Students who enter school from a part-time
   category (Traditional Reservist or Individual Mobilization Augmentee) will normally be
   assigned to a part-time position; students who enter school from a full- time category will be
   assigned to a full-time position upon graduation. The appropriate assignments team (REG
   for O-6 and O-6(s) and HQ AFRC/A1K for O-5 and below) will coordinate with CFMs,
   NAF/CCs, and AFRC/RMG to work follow-on assignments for in-resident students upon
   graduation. Priority consideration should be given to the established developmental pillars.
   (See paragraph 1.3)
   3.2.3. An officer is eligible to attend in-resident DE under the criteria stated in AFI 36-2254
   V2, Reserve Personnel Training, Table 2.1. Applicant must have a minimum of 18 months
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  23


  retainability from course completion date to apply for RSSB courses and 36 months for
  RDEDB courses.
     3.2.3.1. Officers may not attend back to back in resident schools. The only exception is
     Intermediate Development Education followed by the School of Advanced Air and Space
     Studies (SAASS) due to the rigorous curriculum. Members selected by the RDEDB and
     approved by the Air University Commandant.
  3.2.4. Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) is centrally funded for Reserve officers
  attending in-residence developmental education in military status. ARTs attending in civilian
  status are funded by unit O&M. HQ AFRC/A1A will centrally fund AGRs selected to attend
  DE in-residence.
  3.2.5. ARPC/DPA publicizes all DE invitations to apply and convening notices which will
  contain convening dates, nomination suspense and POC information.
  3.2.6. All DE applications are initiated by the Citizen Airman through the rater to the senior
  rater and submitted to ARPC/DPA by the DE invitation to apply announcement suspense
  date. Late applications will not be accepted. ARPC/DPA will route all Judge Advocate
  General RDEDB nominees to TJAG for his ranking and concurrence/non-concurrence prior
  to convening the board.
     3.2.6.1. For Reserve School Selection Board (RSSB). Citizen Airmen may apply for up
     to six courses (two within each category). Categories are: Officer Professional
     Development (OPD), Developmental Education and Joint. Members may be selected for
     one course in each category. Exception: Company Grade Officers (CGOs) may apply
     and be selected for two OPD courses.
     3.2.6.2. Senior raters (as defined in AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation
     Systems) must rank order all their nominees and may disapprove packages at that level.
     IMA packages may be disapproved by senior rater, program manager, or senior reserve
     O-6 in the chain of command. The order should mirror that of the promotion
     recommendations in each nomination category (e.g. 2/5 means the officer is ranked
     number 2 out of 5 applying). Senior raters also include comments that reflect how the
     Air Force can benefit from the member’s attendance and make future assignment
     recommendations. Applications not meeting these requirements within the established
     suspense are returned without action.
     3.2.6.3. The Force Support Squadron (FSS) Education and Training Office is the first
     eligibility and quality review for all school board applications for unit reservists. IMAs
     must work with the appropriate detachment for eligibility and quality review. Quality
     review at a minimum must include: medical check, fitness standards, time on station
     requirements, mandatory separation date, etc.
  3.2.7. Waiver requests. Citizen Airmen requesting eligibility waivers must submit a waiver
  letter of justification endorsed by their senior rater with the application. If the application
  requires a waiver to meet the board and the appropriate waiver is not supplied, the
  application will be returned without action. The DE boards evaluate all waivers and final
  waiver decision rests with the Board President. (Attachment 9).

  3.2.8. Reserve Developmental Education Designation Board (RDEDB) and the Reserve
  School Selection Board (RSSB).
     3.2.8.1. Board Proceedings. The Board President is a general officer. The membership
     of the board is comprised of a minimum of five colonels or above, representing all
     statuses and as many career fields as possible. HQ AFRC/A1L solicits and recommends
     board members through HQ AFRC/A1K to AF/REP for approval; HQ AFRC/A1K then
     notifies ARPC/DPA upon approval. In addition, AF/REP and HQ AFRC/A1K attend
     board meeting as non- voting technical advisors.
     3.2.8.2. ARPC/DPA serves as the DE Board secretariat and reviews all nomination
     packages for final eligibility and completeness. The member’s assigned Education and
     Training office is the first eligibility in quality review for all school board applications.
     IMAs must work with the appropriate detachment for eligibility and quality review.
     3.2.8.3. The RDEDB/RSSB competitively selects applicants determined to be
     exceptionally qualified based upon the whole-person concept, application with senior
     rater input, R-DP with coordinator and functional DT recommendations, and
     considerations of the future needs of the Air Force. Boards identify selectees/alternates,
     aligning them with school quotas and appropriate class dates.
     3.2.8.4. Supplemental Boards. Based on out of cycle requirements, supplemental boards
     are convened by HQ AFRC/A1K with ARPC/DPA coordination. Supplemental board
     proceedings are typically held to fill RSSB courses as required.
     3.2.8.5. Post Board responsibilities. ARPC will:
        3.2.8.5.1. Prepare and staff a results package through AF/REP, HQ AFRC/A1, and
        HQ AFRC/A1K. AF/REP will staff to AF/RE for approval. The package includes
        AF/RE message for public release and attachments that identify re commendations –
        1) Names of selects and school recommended; 2) Alternates; and 3) Non-Selects.
        AF/REP will return approved package to ARPC (with copies to HQ AFRC/A1K) for
        release processing.
        3.2.8.5.2. Produce statistical summary of Board proceedings, to include: quotas,
        application trends, Reserve Category details, gender and race.
        3.2.8.5.3. Close- hold Message Release. Send a “For Official Use Only” message to
        all Military Personnel Sections (MPSs) (copy to HQ AFRC/A1, HQ AFRC/A1K, and
        AF/REP) prior to the public release of the message. This message is only available to
        MPSs and directs the MPSs to notify each senior rater and commander of their
        nominees’ status (select, alternate or non-select). Commanders should notify their
        nominees of their status on the public release date. No organization or individual will
        publicly display or release any select, alternate or non-select list at any time. A
        simultaneous separate notification will go to AF/REP, HQ AFRC/A1, HQ
        AFRC/A1K, and the RMG, advising them that the close-hold message has been sent
        to the MPSs. This allows them to alert commanders and Program Managers and to
        prompt MPSs to act on the message.
        3.2.8.5.4. Public Message Release. Publish the AF/RE Public Message on the public
        release date on the ARPC and AFPERS website. The message will contain the list of
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                25


          selects (with their schools) and Alternates, in accordance with the Privacy Act. Non-

          3.2.8.5.5. Publish an electronic message notifying School Commandants of
          selections prior to sending notifications letters to selects and alternates.
          3.2.8.5.6. Send individual notification letters signed by AF/RE to selects and
          alternates.
          3.2.8.5.7. Send individual notification letters signed by ARPC/CC to non-selectees.
          3.2.8.5.8. Commanders may send an optional Letter of Acknowledgement to the

   3.2.12. In accordance with AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education, the Management Level
   (e.g., MAJCOM, DRU, FOA) may remove an officer from the DE Selection List for cause.
   If so, the member is no longer eligible for DE in-residence during their window of eligibility.
3.3. Enlisted Developmental Education. Enlisted Force Development recognizes the necessity
to provide the right education to develop our Citizen Airmen and meet AF requirements,
including the utilization of AFRC Professional Development Center courses, PME, on- line
courses, and civilian career training and experiences. Continuous education prepares Citizen
Airmen for the transition from the tactical to operational and strategic levels. Courses identified
in Table 3.6 may not be available on each board due to quotas, new or deleted courses, and
course date changes. The invitation to apply will identify relevant courses for the board.
Enlisted professional development (EPD) and joint courses complement DE courses (NCO and
SNCO Academy) and provide an additional breadth and depth of experience. Enlisted members
should complete EPD and Joint course education at appropriate stages of their careers.
   3.3.1. The EDEB selects Citizen Airmen for key DE opportunities and joint courses. The
   EDEB is held at ARPC annually with invitations sent by ARPC/DPA NLT 90 days prior to
   board. All applications are initiated by the member and processed through their rater their
   Command Chief/Superintendent, Wing Commander or equiva lent O-6 then to AFRC/CCC,
   NAF/CCC, ARPC/CCC or RMG/CCC, respectively, for final endorsement. All applicants
   must meet course grade requirement at the time of board convening date. Each NAF, RMG,
   ARPC, and AFRC/CCC must identify their E6-E9 population and may submit applications
   for no more than 5 percent of that population.
   3.3.2. Board Proceedings.        The Board President is AFRC/CCC or designated
   representative. The membership of the board is comprised of a minimum of five E-9s
   representing all statuses and as many career fields as possible. AFRC/CCC solicits board
   members through HQ AFRC/A1K, upon selection. HQ AFRC/A1K then notifies
   ARPC/DPA. ARPC/DPA contacts all board members and provides administrative/ logistical
   support. In addition, AF/REP and HQ AFRC/A1K attend board meeting as non-voting
   technical advisors.
   3.3.3. ARPC/DPA serves as the DE Board secretariat and reviews all nomination packages
   for final eligibility and completeness. The member’s assigned Education and Training office
   is the first eligibility review for all school board applications. IMAs must work with the
   appropriate detachment for eligibility and quality review.
   3.3.4. The EDEB competitively selects applicants determined to be exceptionally qualified
   based upon the whole-person concept, application with senior rater input, R-DP with
   coordinator and DT recommendations, and considerations of the future needs of the Air
   Force. Boards identify selectees/alternates, aligning them with school quotas and appropriate
   class dates.
   3.3.5. Supplemental Boards. Based on out of cycle requirements, supplemental boards are
   convened by HQ AFRC/A1K with ARPC/DPA coordination. Supplemental board
   proceedings are typically held to fill RSSB courses as required.
   3.3.6. Post Board responsibilities.
       3.3.6.1. ARPC/DPA will prepare and staff a results package through HQ AFRC/A1K to
       HQ AFRC/A1 to AF/REP. AF/REP will staff to AF/RE for approval. The package

      includes AF/RE message for public release and attachments that identify
      recommendations – 1) Names of selects and school recommended; 2) Alternates; and 3)
      Non-Selects. AF/REP will return approved package to ARPC (with copies to HQ
      AFRC/A1K) for release processing.
      3.3.6.2. ARPC/DPA will produce statistical summary of Board proceedings, to include
      quotas, application trends, Reserve Category details, gender and race.
      3.3.6.3. ARPC/DPA will prepare close-hold Message Release. Send a “For Official Use
      Only” message to all Military Personnel Sections (MPSs) (copy to HQ AFRC/A1, HQ
      AFRC/A1K, AF/REP, HQ AFRC/DS, AFRC/CV, and AF/RE) prior to the public release
      of the message. This message is only available to MPSs and directs the MPSs to notify
      each senior rater and commander of their nominees’ status (select, alternate or non-
      select). Commanders should notify their nominees of their status on the public release
      date. No organization or individual will publicly display or release any select, alternate
      or non-select list at any time. A simultaneous separate notification will go to AF/REP,
      HQ AFRC/A1, HQ AFRC/A1K, and the RMG, advising them that the close- hold
      message has been sent to the MPSs. This allows them to alert commanders and Program
      Managers and to prompt MPSs to act on the message.
      3.3.6.4. ARPC/DPA will publish the select announcement on the ARPC and AFPERS
      website. The message will contain the list of selects (with their schools) and Alternates,
      in accordance with the Privacy Act. Non-select lists are not made public at any time.
      3.3.6.5. ARPC/DPA will send individual notification letters signed by AF/RE to selects
      and alternates.
      3.3.6.6. ARPC/DPA will send individual notification letters signed by HQ AFRC/CCC
      to non-selectees.
      3.3.6.7. HQ AFRC/A1K will publish an electronic message notifying School
      Commandants of selections prior to sending notifications letters to selects and alternates.
      3.3.6.8. Commanders may send an optional Letter of Acknowledgement to the
      employers of selected members. (Attachment 10).

                                           Chapter 4

                         JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT (JOM)

4.1. Overvie w. Joint Officer Management is a total force program established for the
deliberate development of military officers to enhance the joint warfighting capability of the
United States. The purpose of Air Force Reserve Joint Officer Management program is to
educate and train a select number of Air Force Reserve members experienced in joint matters.
These Citizen Airmen should have a heightened awareness of joint requirements developed
through experience attained in assignments that provide perspectives into multi-service,
interagency, international, and non-governmental environments. In accordance with DoDI
1300.19, Joint Officer Management Program and CJCSI 1330.05, Joint Officer Management
Procedures, the Air Force Reserve uses the Joint Management Information System (JMIS) as
the primary system of record for managing Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) assignments and
credit.
   4.1.1. Few Citizen Airmen become joint qualified due to a limited number of AFR positions
   on the JDAL, other joint assignment/experience opportunities, and participation thresholds
   unique to the ARC.
   4.1.2. Progressive levels of joint qualifications are known as: Level I, Level II, Level III and
   Level IV. Criteria for each level are found in DoDI 1300.19, Enclosure 3. These levels are
   attained through a dual path system. (Attachment 11).
       4.1.2.1. Standard Joint Duty Assignments and the Joint Duty Assignments List. The
       JDAL is a list of SecDef-approved positions where an officer gains significant experience
       in joint matters. Successful completion of an assignment in one of these positions is a
       means to completing criteria for designation as a Joint Qualified Officer (JQO)
       (Attachment 12). The Standard-Joint Duty Assignment (S-JDA) path is only attainable
       through serving in a JDAL position and are only designated for officers. (Attachment
       12).
       4.1.2.2. The Experience-Joint Duty Assignment (E-JDA) path encompasses a majority of
       the joint assignment/experience opportunities and are available for both enlisted and
       officer members. (Attachment 12) Citizen Airmen must self- nominate within JDAMIS,
       https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/jmis/JQSindex.asp, to be considered for experience
       based joint credit.
       4.1.2.3. More information on S-JDA,E-JDA, Joint Professional Military Education
       requriements, waivers, and civilian experiencing crediting are found in CJCSI 1330.05,
       Joint Officer Management Procedures, Enclosures D and H respectively.

     4.2.3.2. In coordination with CFM, provide a candidate(s) and information/statistical
     data to hiring authority for decision.
     4.2.3.3. Ensure officers who graduate from each of the National Defense University
     (NDU) schools (e.g., National War College, Industrial College of the Armed Forces,
     Joint and Combined Warfighting School, or Joint Advanced Warfighting School) for

                                           Chapter 5

                               FORCE MANAGEMENT (FM)

5.1. Overvie w. For the Air Force Reserve, FM involves the movement and placement of
qualified personnel who have chosen to be deliberately managed into Key/Command/JDAL
(K/C/J) positions. The overarching goal is to develop a strategic- level assignment methodology
to effectively grow Citizen Airmen to meet the needs of the AFR. Coordinated strategic
planning guides force development (FD) activity to produce competencies defined by operational
capabilities. FM underpins all activity involved in developing and integrating Citizen Airmen
into Air Force operations. FD ensures all elements are effectively synchronized to deliver the
right person to the right place at the right time.
5.2. Deliberate Assignment Process.
   5.2.1. K/C/J positions provide Citizen Airmen who have chosen and are selected to be
   deliberately managed and are on their career field KPL access to pinnacle leadership roles
   across the Air Force Reserve. Further, to foster strong succession planning, it is essential the
   Air Force Reserve standardize turnover for all K/C/J positions. This will ensure the success
   of AFR mission sets and the continued development through the right experiences, within all
   reserve categories, for Citizen Airmen who are strategic se nior leader capable.
       5.2.1.1. Members who have chosen the voluntary assignment path and are on the KPL
       will have some opportunity to be assigned to K/C/J positions. Not all Citizen Airmen
       who chose to be deliberately managed will be deliberately managed or assigned to K/C/J
       positions.
       5.2.1.2. In order to assign a non-KPL member to a K/C/J position, a wiaver must be
       submitted in writing through HQ AFRC/A1. Final approval authority is AFRC/CV.
   5.2.2. Tour length for all O-6 K/C/J (AGR, ART, IMA, TR), all O-5 and below key, and
   JDAL, all O-6 and enlisted nominative positions will be a maximum of three years. Part-
   time Reservists occupying a JDAL position require a cumulative total of 6 years to obtain
   joint credit.
   5.2.3. Tour length for command chief and deliberately managed command positions is not to
   exceed three years.
   5.2.4. Tour length for joint positions is three years. Part-time Reservists will require other
   additional joint experience to obtain joint credit (total of 6 years or equivalent).
   5.2.5. Personnel accepting these positions must sign a statement of understanding
   acknowledging they are being assigned to a term- limited position and will be notified when
   term is expiring.
   5.2.6. AF/REG will maintain O-6 Potential Reassignment List (PRL) and AF/REGE will
   maintain senior enlisted key position listing.
   5.2.7. CFM’s in conjunction with the A/Fs will maintain a PRL and notify those officers and
   servicing military personnel squadrons NLT 6 months prior to potential reassignment action.
 38                                                       AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


       5.2.7.1. Citizen Airmen who have chosen Voluntary Assignments and encumber a K/C/J
       command managed position may receive PRL notification 6 months prior to potential
       reassignment action.
       5.2.7.2. A/Fs will assist members with their reassignment as required.
   5.2.8. Overages are not authorized for K/C/J positions. However, during reassignment there
   may be overlap of the incoming and outgoing personnel not to exceed 90 days.
   5.2.9. Officers who have chosen deliberate management, offered an assignment and decline,
   do so with prejudice. The first declination will result in loss of deliberate assignment
   opportunity into a K/C/J position for their DT cycle. If a deliberately managed O-6 turns
   down an assignment offer a second time, they will be removed from the deliberate
   assignment pool of candidates, will not have future deliberate assignment opportunities, and
   will be a part of the voluntary assignments pool.
   5.2.10. Exceptions to the deliberate assignments process must be requested in writing
   through HQ AFRC/A1. Final approval authority is AFRC/CV.
   5.2.11. The Air Force Reserve will adhere to AFI 36-2110, Assignments, as appropriate for
   those choosing deliberate management or until superseded by further guidance. AFI 36-
   2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components, applies to voluntary assignments.
5.3. Identification of K/C/J Positions - Officers:
   5.3.1. Career Field Managers (CFMs) and career field senior leaders identify key positions
   and provide updates annually to HQ AFRC/A1K. CFMs will provide detailed position
   descriptions, to include active component inputs as appropriate. The command and joint-
   accrediting positions are designated/coded on the K/C/J Career Management Product (CMP).
   AF/RE-D and AFRC/CV, with the assistance of CFMs, identify key O-6 billets. Command
   positions referenced in this document are all O-6 command positions (Wing Commander,
   Wing Vice Commander and Group Commander positions) as identified on the UMD. Some
   squadron commander and operations officer positions will be used for FD, but those will be
   worked on a case-by-case basis. Joint-accrediting positions are all positions (Active Guard
   Reserve/Individual Mobility Augmentee) listed on the annual publication of the JDAL.
   5.3.2. AF/REG maintains the O-6 K/C/J CMP. HQ AFRC/A1K, CFMs, and A/Fs maintain
   the O-5 and below K/C/J CMP.
       5.3.2.1. CFMs must review and validate their K/C/J CMP in conjunction with their pre-
       DT operations. HQ AFRC/A1K will help facilitate this process. CFMs are responsible
       for managing assignments for K/C/J positions in coordination with AF/REG, RMG and
       selecting officials.
       5.3.2.2. CFMs in coordination with AF/REG and A/Fs review projected vacancies for
       K/C/J billets to ensure appropriate placement of individuals. CFMs will work with A/Fs
       (O-5 and below) and/or AF/REG (O-6s) and senior leadership to evaluate candidates and
       make assignment recommendations; input from the DT will be considered.
       5.3.2.3. Once leadership makes a decision and it is approved, CFMs and A/Fs (O-5 and
       below) and AF/REG (O-6) will work with the appropriate assignment authority who will
       complete the action. Assignment will be reviewed for Uniformed Serivces Employment
       and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) exception and ART career impact.
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 39


5.4. Identification of K/J Positions - Enlisted:
   5.4.1. MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs) review and identify K/J positions annually
   to HQ AFRC/A1K. They provide detailed position descriptions, to include position
   requirements, i.e. CCAF, skill level, and experience.
   5.4.2. HQ AFRC/A1K and AF/REGE maintains the list of key positions and position
   descriptions.
   5.4.3. MFMs review projected vacancies for K/J positions to ensure appropriate placement
   of individuals. MFMs and/or AF/REGE work with hiring authorities and senior leadership to
   evaluate candidates and make assignment recommendations.
   5.4.4. Once leadership makes a decision and it is approved, MFMs or AF/REGE work with
   the appropriate assignment authority who will complete the action.
5.5. In-Residence Developmental Education (DE) Student Place ment (officer only). The
Air Force Reserve selects students to attend DE in-residence based on a number of factors,
including potential to serve as senior leaders. Students recommended for in-residence DE and
selected by the RDEDB to attend DE in-residence will be deliberately managed by the command
and assigned to a follow-on position that uses the applicable skills garnered during the DE
experience and compliments their rank/grade and Air Force Specialty Code.
   5.5.1. In the year preceding DE attendance, DE selects and alternates are expected to update
   their R-DP with assignment preferences.
   5.5.2. ARPC/DPA provides the R-DP for DE selects to HQ AFRC/A1K.
   5.5.3. AF/REG validates projected Wing, Vice Wing, and Group Commander billets.
   5.5.4. AF/REX validates projected JDAL billets.
   5.5.5. CFMs validate all other projected key billets.
   5.5.6. HQ AFRC/A1K chairs the Student Placement Working Group.
       5.5.6.1. The Student Placement Working Group consists of a representative of the
       following: HQ AFRC/A1A/A1C/A1M, ARPC/DPA, NAF/CCs, RMG/CC, RMG/DP,
       CFMs, Reserve Advisors, and AF/REG/REP.
       5.5.6.2. The working group considers inputs provided by commanders and students in
       the R-DP, the appropriate assignment vacancies, as well as the advice of the applicable
       CFM and group representative.
       5.5.6.3. The group develops a list of recommended matches between each DE student
       and a projected vacancy. Assignments must adhere to directives from higher
       headquarters on requirements for placement after completion of specialized DE programs
       (joint/fellowships/School of Advanced Air & Space Studies).
           5.5.6.3.1. The group will primarily pursue/recommend assignments which match the
           participation status (part-time/full-time) student held when applying/selected for DE
           unless change in status is required by higher headquarters directives.
           5.5.6.3.2. Goal is to assign DE students to positions which will maximize return on
           investment from in-residence education. In some cases, returning IDE students to
 40                                                     AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013


          original unit upon completion of DE may be appropriate. This does not apply to SDE
          students.
          5.5.6.3.3. Hiring authorities must consider student placement and provide
          justification for disapproval to the AFRC/CV.
       5.5.6.4. The Career Management Board (CMB) reviews initial recommendations during
       the Fall board, assignments are finalized by CMB/Executive Steering Group in
       December, and orders are provided to students by March each year. AFRC/CC or
       designated representative notifies students of placements NLT 45 days after the
       CMB/Executive Steering Group convenes.
5.6. Key Personnel Lists (KPL). The KPL is derived from the DTs and are comprised of HPs.
All DTs must produce a KPL. Hiring authorities must use KPLs maintained by HQ AFRC/A1K
and ARPC to fill K/C/J vacancies. For O-6 assignments, HPs are defined as current group (or
equivalent level) sitting commanders, officers identified on KPLs, or RCSB and RBGQB rosters.
Should a hiring authority select a Citizen Airman from outside the KPL, written documentation
to support a waiver request must be submitted to AFRC/CV with justifica tion for non-selection
from the KPL.
5.7. Voluntary Assignme nts. Some officers will choose to manage their own career with
vectors provided by the DT and their supervisory chain. AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the
Reserve Components, applies. K/C/J assignments may be limited for the members that choose
voluntary assignments but make the KPL. It is expected that most officers will choose this
career path.

Terms
Assignment Facilitator (A/F)—The A/Fs are the tactical means by which the AFR facilitates
education, training and experience (assignments) opportunities for reserve officers. They also
provide career field specific counseling and guidance. In addition, A/Fs are the conduit between
the field, hiring authorities and the CFM.
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   45


Boards—The Reserve School Selection Board (RSSB), Reserved Developmental Education
Designation Board (RDEDB), Reserve Command Screening Board, the Reserve Brigadier
General Qualification Board (RBGQB), and the Enlisted Developmental Education Board
(EDEB) are to be utilized to competitively select individuals for right time training and
developmental opportunities based on the needs of the AFR.
Career Field Manager (CFM)—The CFM is the Air Force Reserve focal point for officers in a
designated career field. The CFM serves as the primary advocate for the career field, addressing
issues and coordinating functional concerns across various staffs. They are responsible for
career field policy, guidance, construction of viable career paths, monitor health and manning of
the career field and ensure their career fields are responsive to both current and future needs of
the Air Force. They are appointed by the Functional Manager.
Career Management (CM)—The Air Force Reserve Career Management Program is a unique
and tailored career planning process that meets Air Force Reserve needs within the context and
culture of the Citizen Airman program.
Career Management Product (CMP)—A customized manpower-like document tailored to
identify AFR officer and enlisted Key, Command (officer only), and JDAL positions.
Career Path Guidance (CPG)—Regardless of AFSC, career paths indicate upward
progression--a “roadmap” of development levels and windows of opportunity for career growth
to help focus an Airman’s expectations and improve career planning. Functional experts develop
AFSC-specific guidance based on needs of the Air Force, individual and strategic planning. The
overlying goal is to provide a “roadmap” of leadership skills to the individual, who sharpens
those in both military and non-military experiences.
Deliberate Management (DM)—The member allows the appropriate managing organization to
map their career assignments based on the needs of the AFR, Expectations are: the member will
fulfill needs of the Command, they have a willingness to relocate as needed, they will accept
continuum of service opportunities.
Developmental Education (DE)—Experiential development is a critical part of implementing
AFR FD. Common to all career fields is the need for developmental opportunities at the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels to prepare Citizen Airmen to meet a variety of mission
challenges. Citizen Airmen first establish a solid grounding in primary career field
competencies. Appropriate follow-on assignments to obtain developmental experiences are at
the Higher Headquarters (NAF, MAJCOM, and Air Staff), Joint, and local leadership
opportunities.
Development Team (DT)—DTs provides oversight of an Airman’s personal development to
meet both functional and Air Force corporate leadership requirements. The functional DTs
concentrate experiences from senior leaders in a respective career field for the sole purpose of
providing feedback and helping each Airman reach their potential. Using the Reserve
Development Plan, DTs vector personnel into education, training and other opportunities that
benefit both the Air Force and Airman.
Enlisted Development Education Board (EDEB)—The EDEB is an annual board that
convenes to select for key enlisted developmental education opportunities.
 46                                                        AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013

and provides vectoring for enhancement opportunities for key positions within their
AFSC/Special Duty. The EFDT consists of a minimum of one senior officer and four Chief
Master Sergeants with the AFSC/Special Duty and qualification.
Force Development (FD)—FD is very broad and includes institutional and occupational
components. Institutional development generally results in leadership, management, enterprise,
and warrior skill proficiency. Occupational development generally results in flying and technical
skill proficiency. FD generally utilizes a combination of the following means: Education
programs such as DE, executive education, graduate degree programs, or undergraduate degree
programs (see definition above); Training programs such as technical training, o n-the-job
training, flying training, ancillary training, expeditionary airman training and, Experience gained
through an appropriate series of job assignments or special programs such as intern programs,
education with industry, or fellowships in research organizations, and leveraged through
appropriate mentoring.
Force Management (FM)—FM involves the movement and placement of qualified personnel
who have chosen to be deliberately managed into Key/Command/JDAL (K/C/J) positions.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)—Highly knowledgeable and experienced member within a
functional area, maintains a wide range of visibility over functional area for training, readiness
and capability issues.
High Potential (HP)—Citizen Airmen identified by career field DT and are on the KPL.
Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL)—The JDAL is a list of SecDef-approved positions where
an officer gains significant experience in joint matters. As mandated in the Goldwater Nichols
Act of 1986 and the National Defense authorization Act (2007), the Reserve Components must
gain expertise in joint matters to participate in Joint, Interagency, Coalition and Multi-National
environment.
Key Personnel List (KPL)—Development Teams establish a Key Personnel List through the
scoring process during career field DTs. The KPL is used to fill Key/Command/Joint officer
positions and Key/Strategic/Joint enlisted positions and referenced when making other
developmental/CM decisions.
Key Positions—Key positions within a career field are those leadership/pinnacle positions
which are highlighted as major, important, essential, pivotal, and limited. They provide valuable
experience in the Air Force Reserve and will present incumbents with vital development for
future key position placement. These positions are at the strategic level, often requiring a
component perspective.
MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM)—The MFM is the AF Reserve focal point for enlisted
members in a designated career field. The MFM serves as the primary advocate for the career
field, they monitor health and manning, addressing issues and coordinating functional concerns
across various staffs MFMs are governed by AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure.
Potential Reassignment List—K/C/J positions are term limited to a maximum of three years.
Citizen Airmen will receive a PRL notification from ARPC/DPA NLT six months prior to their
term limit. Citizen Airmen who have chosen Voluntary Assignments and encumber a K/C/J
AFRCI36-2640 7 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  47


command managed position will receive a PRL notification. A/Fs will assist members on the
PRL with reassignment.
Professional Military and Developmental Education—Education is a vital investment in our
Citizen Airmen. FD recognizes the necessity to provide the right education to develop our
Citizen Airmen and meet AF requirements, including the utilization of AFRC Professional
Development Center courses, Professional Military Education, on- line courses, and civilian
career training and experiences. Continuous education prepares Citizen Airmen for the transition
from the tactical to operational and strategic levels.
Reserve Developmental Education Designation Board (RDEDB)—The RDEDB is an annual
board that convenes at ARPC to select Citizen Airmen to attend in-residence DE schools.
Reserve-Development Plan (R-DP)—The R-DP is the ultimate tool for Citizen Airmen
(Officer/Enlisted) to influence the development of their own careers. They place desires, intent,
goals and abilities for themselves and leadership to help determine the most appropriate career
opportunities. The entire FD process hinges on this extremely important document to match
against the needs of the Air Force.
Reserve Enlisted Force Development Panel (REFDP)—The REFDP provides general Enlisted
