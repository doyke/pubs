                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General Services. The 354th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (354
OSS/OSW) provides or arranges for weather support to the 354th Fighter Wing (354 FW) and
tenant units assigned to EAFB when in garrison or deployed/repositioned worldwide. Weather
products are tailored to meet criteria important to flying operations, base support agencies, and
maintenance operations. This instruction establishes local weather support requirements and
procedures. Agencies requiring routine weather support, not included herein, should contact the
354 OSS/OSW to arrange for and document routine weather support requirements. The
remainder of this document refers to the 354 OSS/OSW as the "Weather Flight".
1.2. Location and Hours of Operation. The Weather Flight is located at 2827 Flightline
Avenue and provides or arranges for weather support from 0700L-2300L, 7 days a week.
Weather Flight services include: weather observations, issuing observed warnings, and
advisories, Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF), and tailored weather support for local EAFB
and worldwide operations. A duty forecaster can be reached at DSN: 377-3140 or 377-1160.
1.3. OWS Weather Support. Weather Flight forecasters work as a team with the 17th
Operational Weather Squadron (17 OWS) located at Hickam AFB to provide weather services
and resource protection for EAFB. Guidelines for this team support are outlined in the 17 OWS
and 354 OSS Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). A 17 OWS forecaster can be reached at
DSN: (315) 449-7924.
     1.3.1. In general the 17 OWS provides EAFB with Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs)
     and forecast weather watches, warnings, and advisories 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The
     Weather Flight will amend the forecast and issue all weather watches, warnings, and
     advisories when weather threatens life or property and the 17 OWS is unable to issue the
     information.
     1.3.2. In the event that 17 OWS operations are impaired due to lost communications, system
     failure or other issues at Hickam AFB, the Weather Flight will reassume responsibility for
     providing all weather support to EAFB. The Weather Flight will retain responsibility for all
     products until the 17 OWS is ready to reassume its weather responsibilities role for the 354
     FW. See AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations - Processes and Procedures, and
     current MOA.
1.4. Airfield Closures and Standby Support. The Weather Flight may initiate standby
operations and suspend local weather services during airfield closure periods upon the 354th
Operations Group commander’s approval. During Weather Flight standby operations, the 17
OWS continues to issue forecast and/or observed weather watches, warnings, and advisories
IAW the 17 OWS/354 OSS MOA. Chapter 4 contains recall procedures in response to severe
weather threats during standby hours.
1.5. Concept of Operations and Routine Support. The Weather Flight, in conjunction with
the 17 OWS, provides weather information to all supported agencies for operational and
decision-making purposes, as well as for the protection of base resources. The Weather Flight
tailors weather information to the specific mission requirements of supported agencies. The
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                      7


Weather Flight provides weather services for military or military-related use only. This support
mainly consists of:
   1.5.1. Forecasts and observations made and transmitted for local and worldwide use.
   1.5.2. Aircrew weather briefings to support wing and transient aircrews.
   1.5.3. Weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
   1.5.4. Regularly scheduled staff weather briefing slides; and in-person staff briefings upon
   request.
   1.5.5. Non-routine support including, climatology briefings and special mission briefings.
   1.5.6. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings, upon advance coordination by local
   flying units.
   1.5.7. Other special briefings and data required by supported units, upon request, as manning
   allows.
   1.5.8. Space weather impacts. Space weather impacts are provided to assigned and tenant
   flying units based upon customer needs, which are outlined in memorandums detailing
   meetings with those organizations. These memorandums are maintained within the Weather
   Flight.
1.6. Weather Flight Duty Priorities. Due to limited resources and manning, the Weather
Flight must prioritize duties. The shift supervisor will take ORM principles into consideration
when complying with the priorities in table 1.1., especially where there is imminent danger to
life and/or property.
ORM EXAMPLE: If the 210 RQS calls for Search and Rescue (SAR) support (unscheduled
briefing - priority #14) while 17 OWS calls to collaborate the TAF with us (priority #7), we
would assist the 210 RQS FIRST as their mission can potentially save lives. In contrast, if a
walk-in transient aircrew were to request briefing support, they would receive the same priority
that is commensurate with the table below.

      15        Conduct mission essential training.
      16        Complete other duties and administrative tasks.


1.7. Limitations. The Weather Flight requires access to communications systems to receive and
transmit data. Current weather systems which rely on base communications systems include: the
New Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS), JET, Local Area Networks (LAN) at Eielson and
Hickam AFB, PMSV radio, and various telephone services including the Defense Switching
Network (DSN), Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET), and Non-secure Internet
Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNET). Various weather equipment also has certain limitations
on data acquisition and reliability.
     1.7.1. LAN interruptions. The LAN provides internet connectivity between the Weather
     Flight and 17 OWS weather forecast products. It also provides connectivity between the
     Weather Flight and local units using N-TFS (i.e. LWNS) software for watch, warning, and
     advisory notification and EAFB observations and forecasts. Lastly the LAN provides the
     Weather Flight access to radar and other data essential to weather operations. The LAN
     network is vital to the timely execution of mission weather services and airfield resource
     protection to EAFB. Interruption of LAN service to the Weather Flight severely degrades
     the Weather Flight’s ability to support wing operations to include, but not limited to: aircrew
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  9


   mission weather briefings or weather watch, warning, and advisory dissemination to wing
   agencies, and all lightning data.
   1.7.2. Backup capability. Weather Flight capability is diminished by communication system
   failures. Backup procedures utilize tactical meteorological and communications equipment,
   facsimile machines, and any other method available for access to required resources.
   1.7.3. Equipment limitations. See Section 3.6. Also reference Section 3.10 for Pilot to
   Metro Radio.
   1.7.4. Duty limitations/priorities. Reference Sections 1.6 and 2.8.
   1.7.5. Observing limitations. Reference Sections 3.5 and 3.6.
1.8. Release of Weather Information, Civilian Contractors, and Legal Claims. Support to
non-DOD agencies and the general public will be provided after the 354 FW Public Affairs
office has granted permission or an LOA is in effect. Deviations are authorized only in the event
of imminent danger to life and/or property. The local National Weather Service (NWS) office is
responsible for service to civilians and non-military agencies. The Weather Flight may provide
military support to civil authorities upon proper coordination.
   1.8.1. Support to civilian contractors. The Weather Flight can provide or arrange for day-to-
   day weather support to civilian contractors who request weather information to support
   government-funded on-base projects.
   1.8.2. Legal claims. The Weather Flight will honor requests for weather information for use
   in legal claims/actions against the government after receiving approval from 354 FW Judge
   Advocate office.
1.9. Evacuation and Relocation. In the event of an evacuation of the Weather Flight in
building 2827, Weather Flight personnel will take appropriate measures to establish alternate
airfield weather services. The minimum requirements for any alternate site are availability of
power, a Class A telephone, a PC, and a data/modem connection with Class A or base LAN
connectivity. The relocation site must be within two statute miles of the center of the runway.
See section 2.6. for details regarding the Weather Flight's relocation site. The Weather Flight
will not be evacuated during exercises. The Weather Flight may be evacuated due to a real-
world disaster, bomb threat, fire, etc.
1.10. Changes to this Base Instruction. To request changes to this base instruction, contact the
Weather Flight at 377-6210/3371/1160 or send written requests/inquiries to: 354 OSS/OSW,

                                            Chapter 2

                 WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS, AND ADVISORIES

2.1. General. The 17 OWS and the Weather Flight issue weather watches, warnings, and
advisories for EAFB when conditions warrant. The term ―base‖ is generally defined as an area 5
nautical miles in radius centered on the EAFB runway complex. Weather watches and warnings
for the base will be issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Weather Flight will coordinate all
requirements for and ensure timely issuance of weather watches and warnings in accordance
with AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures.
2.2. Weather Advisories. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of
environmental phenomena impacting operations. Weather advisories issued with an advance
notice requirement are known as a Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA) and advisories issued to
provide notice of an event’s occurrence are known as an Observed Weather Advisory (OWA).
The 17 OWS issues forecast weather advisories for EAFB while the Weather Flight issues
observed weather advisories. The Weather Flight forecaster works closely with the 17 OWS to
ensure timely issue of forecast advisories as part to the 'eyes forward' and METWATCH
functions.
    2.2.1. Advisory criteria are based on weather conditions that impact operations, sometimes
    greatly, but pose less of a threat to the general base populace than warning criteria conditions
    present. The Weather Flight forecaster always increases METWATCH when advisories are
    issued and there are no special rules on how many advisories may be in effect at one time so
    long as all notifications remain consistent. See Table 2.1 for EAFB weather advisories.

Table 2.1. EAFB Weather Advisory Criteria

       2.2.2.1. Temperature is below 45F (7C) and standing water or a mixture of standing
       water with ice/snow is on the ground. NOTE: The water or mixture must be on the
       ramp, taxiway, or runway.
       2.2.2.2. The temperature is between 20F (-7C) and 45F (7C) and any precipitation is
       occurring.
       2.2.2.3. Dew point is between 25F (-4C) and 45F (7C) and the temperature to dew point

   2.2.3. KC-135 Ice Fod: Issue if temperature is below 50F (10C) and one or more criteria
   is/are occurring:
       2.2.3.1. Runway is wet
   2.2.3.2. Visibility is 1 mile or less in fog
       2.2.3.3. If any precipitation is occurring
2.3. Watches and Forecast Warnings. The 17 OWS issues all watches, forecast warnings, and
forecast advisories for EAFB, generally upon consultation with the duty forecaster at EAFB.
However, the Weather Flight may issue and supersede 17 OWS issued forecast weather warnings
when conditions pose a serious threat to life, property, or mission execution and there is
insufficient time to pre-coordinate the warning with the 17 OWS.
   2.3.1. The Weather Flight issues all observed warnings and observed advisories unless the
   airfield is closed. Upon pre-coordination, the 17 OWS can issue observed warnings and
   advisories so long as the FMQ-19 Lightning Data System (LDS) and Automated Observing
   System (AOS) are operational to provide the 17 OWS access to automated weather sensor
   output.
   2.3.2. All watches, warnings, and advisories are numbered sequentially by month, e.g. the
   second watch, warning, or advisory for September would be 09-002.
2.4. Weather Watch. A special notice provided to advise of the potential for weather
conditions that may pose a threat to property or life. When a weather watch is issued, customers
must take preparatory actions including reviewing applicable checklists to ensure rapid response
in the event a subsequent weather warning is issued.
Weather watch example:
PAEI WEATHER WATCH (06-001)
VALID 03/1900Z (03/1100L) TO 03/2200Z (03/1400L)
HIGH WINDS
THE POTENTIAL FOR SURFACE WINDS, STEADY OR GUSTING, GREATER THAN OR
EQUAL TO 35KTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST EXISTS AT EIELSON AFB. A WARNING
WILL BE ISSUED IF REQUIRED.
2.5. Weather Warning. A special notice provided when a weather condition is occurring or
imminent and poses a threat to property or life. When a weather warning is issued, customers
must take immediate action in accordance with their established weather checklists to safeguard
 12                                                   354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


property and lives. There are two types of weather warnings: the Observed warnings which
require no Desired Lead Time (DLT) and the Forecast Warnings which require a DLT.
Weather warning example:
PAEI WEATHER WARNING (06-001)
VALID 03/1900Z (03/1100L) TO 03/2200Z (03/1400L)
HIGH WINDS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 35KTS
SURFACE WINDS, STEADY OR GUSTING, GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
35KTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST ARE EXPECTED AT EIELSON AFB.
MAXIMUM WIND EXPECTED 39KTS.
2.6. EAFB Weather Watch and Warning Criteria. Table 4.2. outlines watches and warnings
issued by the 17 OWS or Weather Flight for EAFB and the Severe Weather Action Procedures to
be taken by the Weather Flight upon issuance of the weather watch or if no watch is required,
upon issuance of the warning. See Table 4.3. for weather impacts on base activities and Table
4.4 for the SWAP codes.
  354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                    13

                         early release.

     2.6.1. Special Rules Pertaining to warnings. Per AFMAN 15-129, only one (1) weather
     warning in addition to the observed Lightning Warning can be in effect at one time. Thus,
     one warning may contain multiple criteria from table 2.2. Each agency relaying warnings
     and/or using LWNS should read and repeat each warning carefully for its effect, if any, on
     previous warnings.
 2.7. Responding to Severe Weather Events. Supported agencies will create and document
 pre-severe weather protective measures as well as post-severe weather response plans for their
 operations IAW AFI 10-229, Response to Severe Weather Events, and EAFB Weather
 Technicians (Responding to Natural Disasters). All agencies should reference AFI 10-229 for
 their respective severe weather action procedures. At a minimum, procedures developed will
 address:
     2.7.1. Procedures to safeguard personnel and locations to seek shelter from severe weather
     when required.
     2.7.2. Actions for safeguarding and securing aircraft, equipment, and other supplies stored
     outdoors, as required, to minimize damage to wing resources.
     2.7.3. Actions for protection of facilities.
     2.7.4. Precautions to take prior to resuming operations following a severe weather episode.
 2.8. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The Weather Flight and 17 OWS will
 initiate and maintain a heightened meteorological watch and implement Severe Weather Action
 Procedures IAW AFMAN 15-129 to match SWAP Option Codes in Table 2.4.
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                               15


Table 2.4. SWAP – Weather Flight Heightened Actions
     SWAP Option Code                                       SWAP Action
              A                   Increase Observational METWATCH (―Eyes Forward‖)
              B                   Expand METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH activities
              C                   Activate Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT)

   2.8.1. The 17 OWS and Weather Flight staff will review and test recall procedures on an
   annual basis and in conjunction with implementing station closures/standby operations. An
   actual severe weather event can be documented instead of the review exercise.
   2.8.2. In case of unforeseen circumstances such as communications lines failure or 17 OWS
   closure etc., the Weather Flight is obligated to institute at a minimum SWAP option A.
   2.8.3. Upon implementation of any of the SWAP actions in Table 2.4, the 17 OWS or
   Weather Flight technician will contact one of the Weather Flight staff members. During
   airfield closure the 17 OWS will contact Weather Flight leadership who will then
   contact the standby forecaster. The standby forecaster has 30 minutes to report to the
   station. Weather Flight leadership will use ORM to determine if it is necessary to have
   standby personnel report.
   2.8.4. The forecaster on duty reserves the right to implement additional SWAP actions in
   order to apply solid ORM principles on a case-by-case basis.
   2.8.5. The duty forecaster will:
      2.8.5.1. Call Weather Flight leadership when a weather watch (or warning) is issued for
      the criteria below OR a situation arises that they feel will require additional personnel
      (surge in workload, total comm. outage, etc.)
               1) Tornadic activity
               2) Winds greater than or equal to 35 knots
               3) Hail greater than or equal to 3/4"
               4) Freezing precipitation

      2.8.5.2. Perform expanded ―Eyes forward‖ METWATCH, enhanced MISSIONWATCH
      if necessary, and any needed observation augmentation.
   2.8.6. Weather Flight leadership will:
      2.8.6.1. Report to the weather station unless the on-duty forecaster has the situation
      under control and doesn’t require assistance (the only exception is tornadic activity).
      2.8.6.2. Use ORM to determine when their presence at the weather station will not be
      required, even though significant weather is occurring or will occur at the station.
   2.8.6.3. If OPREP-3 criteria are observed, then properly complete input into the Beeline
   process.
 16                                                      354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


   2.8.7. Weather support during periods of severe weather will be limited to mission-essential
   support only to ensure critical weather information is relayed in a timely manner to those
   controlling flying.
   2.8.8. SWAT members will act as the severe weather liaison to 354 FW leadership.
   Depending on the situation, additional notification, to include telephone calls, electronic mail
   messages, and in-person briefings may need to occur. The senior SWAT member on duty is
   responsible to coordinate these activities with 354 OSS/DO, 354 OSS/CC, 354 OG/CD, 354
   OG/CC, 354 FW/CV, and 354 FW/CC, as applicable.
2.9. Distribution of Weather Watches and Warnings. The Weather Flight disseminates all
weather watches and warnings whether issued by the Weather Flight or by the 17 OWS. The
primary mode of dissemination from the Weather Flight to key disseminating agencies includes
the NTFS (LWNS) followed by confirming receipt by telephone or in-person with the Command
Post, Tower, and Base Operations of all issued watches and warnings. See Attachment 5 for the
notification diagram. When the Weather Flight is closed, the 17 OWS will assume responsibility
to disseminate watch and warning information to the 354 FW and 17 OWS will confirm receipt
of electronically disseminated watches and warnings with the 354 FW/CP.
2.10. Distribution of Weather Advisories. Advisories are disseminated using N-TFS/JET.
2.11. Backup distribution of Weather Warnings, Watches, and Advisories. If N-TFS/JET is
inoperative or not available, then disseminate by phone to the following agencies and annotate
on ACC Form 9 (Local Dissemination Log):
      Tower:                               Hotline or 377- 4960
      Command Post:                        Hotline or 377-1500
      SOF:                                 Hotline or 377-2256
      18TH AGRS:                           377-6164 (Ops Desk)
      17 OWS:                              DSN 315-449-7924
      168 ARW:                             377-8815
      Airfield Operations:              377-1861 or hand carried
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 17



                                           Chapter 3

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

3.1. General Airfield Services. Trained and certified weather technicians manually monitor
weather conditions and disseminate observations when specific regulatory and locally
established thresholds are met. Weather technicians take/augment observations IAW AFMAN
15-111, Surface Weather Observations and AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-
Processes and Procedures, while the airfield is open. When Air Traffic Control operations close
outside of normal operating hours, and the Weather Flight is in standby mode of operation
(Section 1.4), the current airfield Notice to Airman (NOTAM) will correctly reflect that airfield
observations are automated and PMSV services are unavailable. Weather Flight leadership will
use sound Operational Risk Management (ORM) practices to develop/document those
operationally significant weather thresholds (normally provided by a fully operational AMOS) to
report while operating in back-up mode. Weather Flight personnel will provide back-up
information in accordance with Attachment 2 and 3 located in AFMAN 15-111.
3.2. Official Observation Site. Weather observation data from the FMQ-19 is collected from
the sensors on the runway. If the FMQ-19 is inoperative, the temporary official observation site
becomes the intersection of the sidewalk and the aircraft parking ramp on the west side of
building 2827.
3.3. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). Weather technicians function under the BWW concept.
This ensures situational awareness and representative FMQ-19 automated/augmented
observations. When the airfield is open, the weather technician will recheck weather conditions
at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes to determine the need for FMQ-19 augmentation or backup.
3.4. Weather Observations. All aspects of observing weather are governed by AFMAN 15-
111, Surface Weather Observations, AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-Processes
and Procedures. See Attachment 3 for observed elements. Observations will be taken (via
FMQ-19 or certified observer) and disseminated over the NTFS or JET hourly and when special
criteria dictate.
3.5. Eielson Observation Augmentation Policy. Weather Flight personnel will augment the
automated observation only during airfield operating hours. During these hours, augmentation
will begin when any type of cloud cover below 5,000 feet and/or visibility less than 5 statute
miles is present or forecast to be present within two hours.
   3.5.1. When the above situation is present, certified weather technicians will perform an
   ―observer-in-the-loop process‖ where the technician will begin enhanced METWATCH to
   ensure accuracy of the FMQ-19 produced observation. During enhanced METWATCH, if
   the technician finds the FMQ-19 data to be non-representative, the technician will augment
   the observation with accurate, manually observed elements that will replace the inaccurate
   data. Observations will be conducted utilizing Basic Weather Watch (BWW) criteria IAW
   AFMAN 15-111. Also, the technician will log out the applicable sensor and continue to
   augment observations until the sensor is logged back in.
 18                                                     354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


   3.5.2. ―Observer-in-the-loop‖ observing will cease and the FMQ-19 will be placed back in
   automated mode when the above mentioned criteria are no longer observed and are not
   forecast to be observed within the following two hours.
   3.5.3. When augmenting the FMQ-19, certified weather technicians will use experience and
   available meteorological tools to observe weather elements. Cooperative Weather Watch
   (CWW) with ATC and PIREPS will be considered; however, only a certified weather
   technician has the authority to take official observations.
3.6. Observing Limitations (Primary Location).
   3.6.1. Due to the proximity of the FMQ-19 sensor array to the active runway, persistent
   snow removal efforts can cause false low visibility/ceiling readings to occur.
   3.6.2. The base power plant discharge will temporarily lower the visibility/ceiling at times
   due to the close proximity of the observation site (1 mile east).
   3.6.3. In the event a weather sensor malfunctions during hazardous weather, maintenance
   personnel will assess weather and safety concerns along with current flying operations before
   attempting repair actions. This may result in significant delays in the repair actions and
   impact the accuracy of weather products dependent on that equipment. See attachment 6 for
   equipment maintenance priorities.
   3.6.4. Weather sensor outages. In the event of weather sensor(s) outages, Weather Flight
   personnel will revert to using tactical systems to observe conditions for dissemination to 354
   FW customers. Tactical systems and manual data collection require more time to create and
   disseminate an observation, hence delays in other services i.e. see duty priorities Table 1.1.
3.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). During an evacuation of the Weather Flight, the
weather technician will relocate to the OSS headquarters building (Bldg #2865), phone # 377-
2709, with tactical observing equipment to include the Kestrel, compass, tactical rain gauge, and
relocation kit. Observations will be disseminated over the NTFS hourly and when special
criteria dictate. If this location is unavailable, use a site that meets requirements outlined in
Section 1.9.
   3.7.1. Airfield sensors and NTFS/JET operations. The weather technician will augment
   FMQ-19 observations using the NTFS/JET when he/she has access to the LAN and the
   system is operating. Dissemination of the observations will also be accomplished using
   NTFS/JET. Forecasts, watches, and warnings will continue to be input into the Weather
   Flight NTFS/JET by 17 OWS.
       3.7.1.1. Offices to contact upon station relocation to the AOL. Upon relocation to the
       AOL, the weather technician will contact the following in order: 354 OSS/OSAT (ATC
       Tower), 354 FW Command Post, 17 OWS, 18 AGRS, 168 ARW, 210 RQS, Base Ops
       (354 OSS/OSAM), Eielson Range Control, Fairbanks Tower, Elmendorf Base Weather,
       and the Flight Commander or NCOIC if after normal duty hours.
       3.7.1.2. When the FMQ-19 is not operational, the weather technician will use the MOS
       kit to augment any airfield sensor data not available and will call the 17 OWS with the
       required observations. The 17 OWS will then enter the observations for longline
       dissemination. Local backup dissemination is outlined in Section 6.6.
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     19


       3.7.1.3. In the event the FMQ-19, NTFS/JET and 17 OWS are not operational, the
       weather technician will take observations using the MOS kit and will make every attempt
       to contact another Weather Flight to disseminate the EAFB observation longline. Local
       backup dissemination is outlined in Section 6.5.
       3.7.1.4. Adequate space and communications capabilities exist at the primary AOL to
       sustain virtually no impact on Mission Weather Services after evacuation.
3.8. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). Qualified non-weather personnel assist weather
technicians in monitoring the weather conditions at Eielson by using a CWW. This process
assists in the reporting of weather conditions that could affect flight safety or are critical to the
safety or efficiency of other local air and ground operations.
   3.8.1. ATC personnel that have been certified to evaluate tower visibility will report changes
   in tower prevailing visibility to the Weather Flight when tower visibility is less than 4 statute
   miles (6000 meters) and is different from the surface prevailing visibility, and reporting
   sector visibility.
   3.8.2. ATC personnel are also expected to notify the Weather Flight when:
       3.8.2.1. Visibility increases or decreases by one reportable value.
       3.8.2.2. Precipitation begins or ends.
       3.8.2.3. Any indication of convective activity (lightning or cumulonimbus clouds on the
       horizon).
       3.8.2.4. Rapid development, clearing, lowering, or rising of cloud layers.
       3.8.2.5. Any other meteorological condition that could have significant impact on the
       airfield or hazardous/severe weather conditions (hail, wind damage, etc.).
       3.8.2.6. ATC personnel will pass any PIREPs that are relayed to them to the on duty
       weather observer no later than 5 minutes after receipt.
   3.8.3. The Weather Flight is required to reevaluate weather conditions whenever reliable
   sources (i.e., ATC, pilots, law enforcement, etc.) report weather conditions different from the
   last disseminated observation (e.g., different ceiling height, visibility, present weather).
   Based on reevaluation of the different weather conditions reported and local policy, weather
   personnel will backup or augment the FMQ-19 as appropriate.
   3.8.4. Weather Flight personnel will:
       3.8.4.1. Notify the tower as soon as possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at the
       weather unit’s observation point decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceeds 4
       miles (6000 meters).
       3.8.4.2. Reevaluate the surface prevailing or sector visibility, as soon as practical, upon
       initial receipt of a differing control tower value, and upon receipt of subsequent
       reportable changes at the control tower level.
       3.8.4.3. Use control tower values of prevailing or sector visibility as a guide in
       determining the surface visibility when the FMQ-19 is not representative and when the
       view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings, aircraft, etc. The presence of a
       surface-based obscuration, uniformly distributed to heights above the level of the tower,
 20                                                      354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


       is sufficient reason to consider the weather unit’s prevailing visibility to be the same as
       the control tower level.
       3.8.4.4. Due to policy change, tower visibility will no longer be reported in surface
       weather observations. However, routine dissemination of tower visibility between ATC
       tower personnel and RAPCON controllers, Airfield Management personnel (PTD), and
       weather personnel (PMSV) is vital.
   3.8.5. CWW with Air Traffic Controllers. Tower controllers have a complete 360-degree
   view of the airfield complex; a CWW agreement exists between ATC and the Weather Flight
   to train ATC controllers and outline the technical requirements of the program. Controller
   assistance is provided IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, AFMAN 15-111, Surface
   Weather Observations, and FAA Order 7110.65.
3.9. Automated Telephone Answering Device (ATAD). The Weather Flight provides a
telephone recording of forecast weather for EAFB at (907) 377-6127. The recording is updated
three times daily when new forecasts are issued by the OWS; time permitting, the recording is
updated when the forecast is amended. The forecast is intended for non-operational use only and
provides agencies and individuals the opportunity to monitor weather of interest to them.
3.10. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The Weather Flight continuously monitors UHF
346.6 MHz to provide weather data to aircraft (either airborne or on the ground). The range is
approximately 200 nautical miles (NM) at normal operating altitudes. The Weather Flight will
solicit aircrews to provide PIREPs of weather conditions over this frequency.
   3.10.1. Weather Flight Closure periods. PMSV service will be unmonitored when the
   Weather Flight is closed. Weather station closure periods and unavailability of PMSV will
   be listed in current airfield NOTAM as applicable.
   3.10.2. Short-Term PMSV Outages. Weather Flight personnel will notify ATC of any
   PMSV outage and expected time of return to service. Aircrews will be briefed on PMSV
   outages during their flight weather MEF brief. ATC will monitor UHF 346.6 MHz and
   advise aircrews attempting to contact metro to contact Base Operation's Pilot-to-Dispatch on
   VHF 372.2 for metro/weather service as time and resources permit. During PMSV outages
   aircrew can also request a telephone patch through the 354 FW/CP to the Weather Flight.
   Additional PMSV service can be obtained from Elmendorf AFB Weather (3 OSS/OSW) at
   UHF 346.6. Aircrew should refer to Flight Information Handbook Section C for other
   METRO stations.
   3.10.3. Long-Term PMSV Outages. For outages expected to last more than 1 day, the
   procedures outlined in paragraph 2.9.2. will be followed and additionally the outage and
   backup procedures will be documented in the current airfield NOTAM and possibly the FLIP
   when the outage is expected to be lengthy.
   3.10.4. PIREP relay. During PMSV outages, ATC and Command Post personnel will relay
   all PIREPs to the weather technician for input into worldwide weather systems.
   3.10.5. PMSV Limitations. METRO below 3000 ft reception from 300°-090° is limited
   beyond 15 NM by terrain, below 15000 ft limited beyond 75NM, no limitations within
   100NM at 20000 ft.
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                              21


   3.10.6. The Weather Flight has phone patch capability through 354 FW/CP at (907) 377-
   1500. This service is also not available during Weather Flight closure periods.
3.11. PIREPS. All PIREPS received by the Weather Flight will be disseminated over the NTFS
system. See Attachment 3 Section A.3.3. for elements specific to PIREPs.
   3.11.1. 354 OG aircrew shall relay to the Weather Flight directly or via phone patch by
   ATC, CP, or Base Operations all forecast or unforecast Urgent Upper Air (UUA) PIREPs for
   weather phenomena encountered. See Flight Information Handbook, Section C, for PIREP
   requirements+- while enroute.
   3.11.2. Any base agency receiving a PIREP without the capability to disseminate it into
   weather networks, shall relay it within 5 minutes of receipt to the Weather Flight for
   dissemination.
3.12. Toxic Corridors, Chemical, and Effective Downwind Messages. IAW AFI 10-2501,
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations and the 354 FW
Plan 10-2, upon notification of any incident that involves a toxic spill or base emergency the
Weather Flight will provide wind direction and speed along with any other required information
for toxic corridor calculations performed by 354 CES/CEF. Updates will be provided as
required. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM) and Effective Downwind Messages (EDM) are
available upon request. Their format and encoding/decoding information can be found in
Attachments 10 and 11.
 22                                                       354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


                                            Chapter 4

                        ROUTINE MISSION WEATHER SERVICES

4.1. General. The Weather Flight provides mission-tailored Weather Services (MWS) and
MISSIONWATCH for all EAFB agencies. The Weather Flight in conjunction with the 17 OWS
develops a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF), publishes a Mission Execution Forecast
(MEF), produces DD Form 175-1s, and provides briefings tailored to customer needs. The
Weather Flight embraces a tailored support philosophy, in which the Weather Flight develops
and maintains a customer-based relationship. Through this relationship the Weather Flight learns
customer capabilities and needs and in turn is integrated throughout all phases of the mission. All
agencies on EAFB receiving routine mission weather services will be contacted at least once
annually by the Weather Flight to review customer support requirements and customer
satisfaction with services provided.
4.2. Limitations.
   4.2.1. NTFS/JET Operability. An NTFS/JET outage impairs the ability of Weather Flight
   and 17 OWS to communicate and issue products supporting MWS. Reference Sections 1.7
   and Chapter 6.
   4.2.2. LAN Connectivity. Reference Section 1.7.
   4.2.3. 17 OWS Operability. Reference Section 1.3.2.
4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). The 17 OWS issues a TAF every 8 hours to cover
a 24-hour period. EAFB TAFs are disseminated over NTFS/JET at 0400Z, 1200Z, and 2000Z.
AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-
Processes and Procedures, AFI 15-128, Aerospace Weather Operations-Roles and
Responsibilities govern all aspects of forecasting. See section 1.3.2. for Weather Flight
responsibilities when the 17 OWS is unable to support.
   4.3.1. Forecast elements represent the most probable conditions expected during the forecast
   period and in the forecast area. Unless otherwise specified, the forecast weather elements in
   the main body of the TAF (clouds, present weather, wind, etc.) apply to the area within a 5
   statute mile radius off the center of the airfield complex. See Attachment 5 for elements
   specific to TAFs.
   4.3.2. TAFs are amended as conditions warrant. See Attachment 4, Section A.4.2. for TAF
   amendment criteria.
4.4. Routine/Training Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs). MEFs are essentially mission-
specific forecasts that are developed using a 12-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129, and
may be provided by a number of methods (Web-Based, verbally, person-to-person, etc). During
this process, the Weather Flight will fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater
weather centers, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g. flying schedule) and
agencies. The end result is a product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and
relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever means proves most effective.
MEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the 17
OWS and AFWA. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  23


conditions threaten resource protection, the Weather Flight will amend the MEF to accurately
reflect conditions and back-brief the 17 OWS when time permits.
   4.4.1. MEF production. Due to mission requirements and flying schedules, the only flying
   unit on Eielson AFB the Weather Flight provides a MEF is the 18 AGRS squadron.
   4.4.2. Eielson AFB Launch and Recovery Mission Execution Forecast (L/R MEF). The L/R
   MEF determines the critical thresholds of the day and fuses together AFWA and 17 OWS
   produced analysis, forecast, and model products with locally analyzed surface, METSAT
   (Meteorological Satellite), and WSR-88D data producing a tailored forecast valid for the
   daily 354 FW flying window. The L/R MEF applies to the area within a 5-nautical mile
   radius of the Eielson AFB airfield complex. The L/R MEF will be prepared and transmitted
   locally over the base LAN. This product will be available on the LAN no later than 3 ½
   hours prior to the first takeoff, and will remain valid through the last arrival. If the LAN is
   down the L/R MEF will be sent via fax, verbally briefed over the phone, or briefed in person.
       4.4.2.1. Specification Criteria. Specification criteria are threshold values the Weather
       Flight operators use to determine when a change in expected weather conditions must be
       included in the MEF. Each MEF (scheduled or amended) will specify the time of
       occurrence to the nearest hour (and or minute as appropriate), the duration, and intensity
       (where applicable), when one or more of the weather elements in Table 3.1. is/are
       expected to occur within 5 nautical miles of the center of the Eielson airfield complex.

   4.5. MISSIONWATCH. Providing up-to-date information is critical for mission success and
   safety. Each element of the Weather Flight has specific areas to ensure mission success. The
   Airfield Weather Element will ensure the Supervisor of Flying is kept abreast of weather
   elements impacting Eielson AFB and alternate airfields. The Mission Weather Element will
   ensure the Top 3 for the 18 AGRS is kept abreast of weather impacts to the mission. If a weather
   forecaster is not located at the Mission Weather Element, the responsibility will shift to the
   Airfield Weather Element. The Weather Flight conducts MISSIONWATCH from the beginning
   to the end of every customer’s mission support IAW AFMAN 15-129. Transient aircrews are
   the exception to this policy.
   4.6. Weather Briefings and Instructional Briefings. The Weather Flight provides many
   routine weather briefings, both in and out of the weather station. Non-routine briefings such as
 28                                                         354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


Mobility Concept, Special Missions, pre-deployment, climatological, and Crisis Action Team
(CAT) briefings are coordinated by the requesting agency. Additionally, an Instrument
Refresher Course (IRC) briefing will be provided. The Weather Flight will provide a metrics
summary during the IRC brief and solicit improvements for the MEF as well. These briefings
provide commanders and staff, operations, and aircrew personnel with valuable weather
information for planning and decision making.
Non-Routine Briefing Request Procedures. A requesting agency will provide the Weather Flight
information on the time, location, and required content of the briefing with a minimum of 48
hours notice when possible. In the event that Weather Flight personnel cannot be reached to
coordinate the required weather briefing support, contact the 354 FW/CP. The 354 FW/CP will
contact the required personnel to meet a weather support request/requirement.
4.7. Wing Stand-up/Staff Meeting. Briefing slides are provided daily/weekly, and in person
briefs are provided as required.
4.8. 18 AGRS in-garrison support. The 18 AGRS mission is to prepare CAF, joint, and allied
aircrews for tomorrow’s victories through challenging, realistic threat replication, training, test
support, academics, and feedback. Weather support is primarily delivered to the 18AGRS via
mass briefings on location. Mass weather briefings are provided to the 18 AGRS during daily
operations, during contingencies, and upon request. The 18 AGRS will coordinate with the
Weather Flight 24 to 72 hours in advance of any special-request briefing, if possible. They will
also provide the following information to the Weather Flight: date, time, and place of the
briefing, takeoff time, destination, arrival time, flight level, and specific product requests such as
sea surface data. The Weather Flight has an embedded briefer approach with the 18 AGRS. The
embedded approach allows the weather briefer to better tailor the mission brief and provide
higher quality customer support. To ensure proper level integration, the briefer on duty will
prepare the brief for the first go at the weather station. This allows a higher fidelity of data at the
briefer’s fingertips. The briefer will then proceed to the brief location 15-30 minutes prior to the
brief, and will remain in place at the dedicated weather desk until STEP. Mass weather briefings
will include, but are not limited to:
   4.8.1. Eielson forecast weather conditions, to include cloud cover, visibility, weather, and
   winds.
   4.8.2. Weather warnings/advisories in effect.
   4.8.3. Temperatures and pressure altitudes for valid period.
   4.8.4. Upper level winds (true direction) and temperatures (degrees F).
   4.8.5. Climb winds from surface to flight level.
   4.8.6. Sunrise, sunset, beginning/ending civil and nautical twilight, and lunar information (as
   required).
   4.8.7. Latest reported runway condition reading (RCR) as required.
   4.8.8. Alternate base weather and Range/MOA weather (as required).
   4.8.9. Electro-optical support limited to solar data, lunar data, and aurora activity for NVG
   operations. For E-O munitions data, see chapter 5.4. of this instruction.
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   29


4.9. 18 AGRS Mobile Training Teams (MTTs). During 18 AGRS deployments or MTTs, the
Weather Flight will provide or arrange for weather support at the deployed location IAW the
AFMAN 15-129. The preferred method of providing support is to have one individual from the
Weather Flight deploy with the 18 AGRS. However, if this option is not available, support will
be arranged with the host unit prior to the 18 AGRS arrival on station.
4.10. 168 ARW Weather Support. The Weather Flight will provide operational flight weather
briefing support to the 168 ARW. Briefing support is accomplished by providing a DD Form
175-1 upon request. The 17 OWS will provide operational flight weather briefing support when
there is not a forecaster on duty. Briefing requests will be phoned or faxed to 354 OSS/OSW

                                            Chapter 5

                           SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout Eielson AFB, and verified by the Weather Flight leadership. The
requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If
routine weather support does not cover a specific local weather requirement, extra effort will be
made (time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the condition. In turn, the unit
is responsible for contacting the Weather Flight should their requirements change.
5.2. 353rd Combat Training Squadron. The mission of the 353 CTS is to develop, plan, and
execute PACAF's large force exercise, RED FLAG-Alaska (RF-A). The 353 CTS integrates 35
threat systems, electronic combat assets, and over 400 targets to provide realistic combat training
to U.S. and coalition forces. They utilize the world's most advanced debriefing system to
reconstruct 6,000 combat training sorties annually. Exercises dual-based command and control
support with Detachment 1, 353 CTS at Elmendorf AFB.
   5.2.1. RF-A weather support is conducted by an RF-A weather team consisting of personnel
   deployed to EAFB. The EAFB Weather Flight acts as an oversight/quality control agency
   for RF-A weather teams. The Weather Flight will provide personnel to directly support RF-
   A only when there is a shortfall of deployed personnel.
   5.2.2. In support of the 353 CTS, the 354 OSS/OSW will:
       5.2.2.1. Serve as the Staff Weather Officer (SWO) for RF-A exercises when the 354 FW
       is the lead wing. The Weather Flight will assist with and support all RFA exercises to the
       extent that 354 FW mission requirements allow.
       5.2.2.2. Provide or arrange reception, employment, and redeployment weather support
       for exercise participants in conjunction with Wing Weather Officer/Wing Weather
       NCOs. 354 OSS/OSW will provide training and assistance to Wing Weather
       Officer/Wing Weather NCOs deployed to Eielson.
       5.2.2.3. Attend RFA planning conferences. The Weather Flight will ensure deploying
       units understand existing support limitations for RF-A exercises. The Weather Flight is
       also responsible for planning/coordinating weather support in advance of an RF-A
       exercise and is also responsible for maintaining weather equipment at the CTS.
   5.2.3. DISTANT FRONTIER (DF). DF is simply when visiting units to EAFB for RF-A
   conduct training out of EAFB either before or after an RF-A exercise. These units may stay
   for various lengths of time. Units visiting EAFB for DF are responsible for providing their
   own weather personnel for their stay at EAFB.
       5.2.3.1. If the unit’s home weather flight is not able to provide personnel due to manning
       issues, the EAFB Weather Flight will provide weather support. The unit’s home weather
       flight will provide sufficient notice and support requirements to the EAFB Weather Flight
       prior to the unit’s arrival IAW the 15-129.
       5.2.3.2. Support provided by the Weather Flight will consist of an electronically
       delivered brief identical to that briefed to the 18 AGRS. The Weather Flight will not
 32                                                       354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


       provide personnel for a brief in person. Weather Flight personnel will be available for
       phone updates.
       5.2.3.3. The Weather Flight will deliver the brief to email addresses provided by the
       visiting unit upon their arrival. Delivery time to the visiting unit will be identical to the
       18 AGRS brief time and forecasts within the brief will be tailored to the 18 AGRS flying
       window. If the visiting unit needs the time(s) altered, they must coordinate with the
       Weather Flight at least 24 hours in advance.
5.3. 45th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron Support. While deployed to EAFB, the
45 ERS is under the operational control of the 354 FW. Therefore, any aircraft are considered
local aircraft and will receive support as such. For briefing purposes, the 45 ERS is no longer
considered a local agency when scheduling arrival and departure sorties.
   5.3.1. The Weather Flight will provide a DD Form 175-1 to 45 ERS aircrews as requested.
   The Weather Flight will also provide a slide show presentation in conjunction with the DD
   Form 175-1. The slideshow is delivered by whatever means possible. Contents of the slide
   show typically include but are not limited to:
       5.3.1.1. Alaska Satellite Loop.
       5.3.1.2. North Pacific Satellite Image.
       5.3.1.3. Launch/Recovery Forecast.
       5.3.1.4. Applicable En-route Hazards Charts.
       5.3.1.5. Applicable Flight-level Wind Charts.
       5.3.1.6. Divert Airfield Forecasts.
       5.3.1.7. Volcano Activity Alerts.
   5.3.2. The Weather Flight will provide a briefer in person, if available. Otherwise support
   will be delivered via fax, phone, and email.
   5.3.3. The Weather Flight does not have the capability of overlaying aircraft routes on
   weather charts or building/delivering briefs via SIPRnet.
   5.3.4. The most effective way of contacting the Weather Flight is by phone, numbers are
   listed in chapter 1.2. Avoid contacting the Weather Flight via SIPRnet.
5.4. Electro-Optical Mission Execution Forecast Data. Electro-optic (E-O) support for
AGMs will be provided to the 353 CTS for RED FLAG-Alaska (RF-A) only. During RF-A, E-O
data will be provided at each mass brief. During RF-A, forecasts are produced by the RF-A
weather team, not by the Eielson Weather Flight. In the event a non RF-A unit should need E-O
data, the unit must coordinate with the 354 OSS/OSW, 24 to 72 hours in advance, on any
pertinent target information such as time over target, type of target, and active range to be used
(R2202, R2205, R2211). OPSEC - Association of specific weapon systems along with Tactical
Decision Aids (TDAs) is classified.
   5.4.1. Contents.
   5.4.2. E-O tactical decision aids for specific targets in specific ranges of operation.
   5.4.3. Detection and lock-on ranges in nautical miles.

                                         Chapter 6

                        WEATHER DISSEMINATION SYSTEMS

6.1. New Tactical Forecast System (NTFS). The NTFS is a software-based weather data
dissemination system that resides on an approved 354 FW LAN-PC based computer system
running the Windows XP operating system (or newer compatible version). Data transmitted over
the NTFS originates at the 17 OWS or Weather Flight and is sent to selected customers
throughout EAFB.
   6.1.1. Data transmitted over the NTFS is disseminated via the base LAN with read-only
   permissions. An end-user on the NTFS system has the ability to display 17 OWS and
   Weather Flight products.
   6.1.2. NTFS Operability. An NTFS outage impairs the Weather Flight’s and 17 OWS’s
   ability to disseminate weather information required by 354 FW customers. In the event of an
   outage, the Weather Flight will notify centralized points of contact to ensure critical
   information is disseminated. See Section 6.5
6.2. NTFS Software. Customers desiring access to the NTFS software for displaying EAFB
specific weather products must have base LAN access. Potential users must obtain a user id and
password to access the system. To set up a user account, submit an email to: ―Base Weather
Distro" with name, organization, phone number in the body of the email, and type ―Request for
LWNS access‖ in the subject line. The request will be passed along to the NTFS program
managers, and they will arrange to load the software and give a demonstration to the user. A
new user must change their password immediately and every 60 days thereafter.
6.3. NTFS Hardware. Units with NTFS hardware, such as ATC terminals that receive surface
weather observations, weather watches, and warnings for EAFB on monitors installed in the
tower cab must coordinate all location changes of NTFS terminals with appropriate agencies.
Supported agencies will submit an AF Form 3215, C4 Systems Requirement Document, to the
Communications Squadron for relocation of communications lines.
   6.3.1. Units will not place NTFS equipment on Automated Data Processing Equipment
   (ADPE) accounts or on Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) as the
   Weather Flight has ultimate accountability for it. However, in the event of missing
   equipment, supported agencies will assist in the Report of Survey (ROS) process to the
   maximum extent possible.
   6.3.2. Units with NTFS/LWNS hardware or software must provide the Weather Flight with a
   point of contact.
6.4. Maintenance. Agencies with NTFS/LWNS software problems must contact the Weather
Flight for assistance. For ATC terminal support, Weather Flight personnel will perform or
arrange for maintenance on the NTFS system.
6.5. NTFS Back-up Operations. In the event that the NTFS becomes inoperative or the
Weather Flight must be evacuated, the duty weather technician will activate the NTFS Back-up
Plan. In accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, ATC elements and
354 FW/CP will receive priority notification.
354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                               35


   6.5.1. Primary NTFS Backup Plan. The weather technician will contact ATC elements and
   354 FW/CP via telephone communications with required observations, weather watches,
   warnings, and advisories until the NTFS system is restored. 17 OWS will be notified by
   telephone when the NTFS is inoperable; the Weather Flight will pass observations via
   telephone to the 17 OWS for input into NTFS. The 17 OWS will relay forecasts, watches,
   warnings, and advisories to the 354 FW/CP and the relocated weather forecaster. The
   weather technician can also transmit observations via JAAWIN. The observer needs to set up
   a user name and password to be able to transmit data.
   6.5.2. Communications Outage Backup Plan. Should all telecommunications methods fail,
   either the crash net in 354 OSS/OSAM or runners will be used to disseminate weather
   information. If runners are used, weather information will be delivered to ATC and the
   Command Post only. All other agencies must arrange for pick up of weather information.
6.6. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is the next generation in weather dissemination
systems and is scheduled to replace NTFS in the early 2011 timeframe. There are no anticipated
impacts and/or degradation to product viewing and weather data dissemination in the transition
to JET. The transition to JET will include moving to a LAN-based platform where the server is
located in the EAFB NCC as opposed to the Base Ops building. This transition will create easier
weather data/product viewing with various agencies on base. However, limitations are incurred
for needed maintenance with the server being located outside the Weather Flight. Additionally,
with JET being LAN based, any degradation to the LAN and/or accessibility to the LAN will
hamper weather data viewing/dissemination. Revision of the 354FWI 15-101 may be needed
upon the implementation of JET.
 36                                                     354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011

Base.— An area 5 statute miles in radius centered on building 2827, Eielson AFB, AK.
Meteorological Watch (Metwatch).— The process of monitoring observed and forecast
weather and informing supported agencies when certain established weather conditions that
could affect their operations and/or pose a hazard to property/life occur or are expected to occur.
Mission Watch.— The Weather Flight will watch weather along routes of flight or other special
interest areas/items as required, by mutual arrangement with the supported customer.
Weather Advisory.— Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of
environmental phenomena impacting operations. Weather advisories issued with an advance
notice requirement are known as a Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA) and advisories issued to
provide notice of an event’s occurrence are known as an Observed Weather Advisory (OWA).
Weather Watch.— A special notice provided to advise of the potential for weather conditions
that may pose a hazard to property or life. When a Weather Watch is issued, customers must
take preparatory actions to ensure rapid response in the event a subsequent Weather Warning is
issued.
Weather Warning.— A special notice provided when an established weather condition is
occurring or imminent and poses a hazard to property or life. When a Weather Warning is
issued, customers must take immediate action to safeguard property and lives. There are two
types of Weather Warnings–those with no Desired Lead Time (i.e., observed warnings) and
those with Desired Lead Times (i.e., forecast warnings).

                    OBSERVATION COMPONENTS AND CRITERIA

A3.1. Observation Back-up and Supplementation. The FMQ-19 is considered a fully-
automated weather observing system. However, the FMQ-19 is not able to report all weather
elements that can be encoded in an observation. Furthermore, it may at times report
misrepresentative data or not report an element at all. During these situations, the FMQ-19 will
need augmenting. For further detail on local augmentation procedures, see section 3.5. Backing-
up the FMQ-19 will occur when a sensor is misreporting data or is broken. During this time,
only the element being misreported will be adjusted in the observation. Supplementation will
occur when required elements needing to be reported (i.e. tornadic activity) are occurring that are
beyond the FMQ-19’s sensor capabilities. Also during this time, only the element(s) the system
is unable to report will be added to the observation.
A3.2. Elements of Surface Observations.
   A3.2.1. Sky condition. Amount and height of clouds above ground level (AGL).

Table A3.1. Cloud Coverage
Nomenclature                                      Sky coverage
CLR (clear)                                       No clouds (below 12,000ft AGL)
FEW (few)                                         1/8 to 2/8 of the sky covered
SCT (scattered)                                   3/8 to 4/8 of the sky covered
BKN (broken                                       5/8 to 7/8 of the sky covered
OVC (overcast)                                    covering all of the sky


   A3.2.2. Ceiling. The lowest broken or overcast layer is defined as the ceiling. When
   phenomena such as fog completely block the view of the sky, the ceiling is defined by the
   vertical visibility into the obscuration (VV). If it is partially obscured (one cannot see all of
   the horizon), sky condition will be reported and a remark will be made to show what is
   obscuring the horizon. There are two additional items that may be used to further define the
   sky condition: CB—cloud likely containing a thunderstorm and TCU—cloud that has
   moderate vertical development which could later develop into thunderstorms and indicate
   potential turbulence.
   A3.2.3. Prevailing visibility and obstructions to vision. The prevailing visibility is the
   greatest unobstructed viewing distance over half or more of the horizon circle, not
   necessarily in contiguous sectors. The weather technician measures prevailing visibility
   using known landmarks during the day or unfocused lights of moderate intensity at night.
   Obstructions to visibility such as dust, haze, or smoke are reported whenever they reduce the
   prevailing visibility to less than seven statute miles. Precipitation is always reported when
   observed. Use the following table to interpret the observation:
    354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  47

       A3.2.4. Runway Visual Range (RVR). RVR is an instrumentally derived value that
       represents the horizontal distance (i.e., not slant range) an aircrew will see down the runway
       from the approach end. RVR is measured by transmissometers at both ends of the runway.
       The weather technician increases awareness of RVR values within 3 hours of a prevailing
       visibility forecast of 2 SM or less or if it is already occurring. RVR is reported when the
       prevailing visibility is less than or equal to one statute mile and/or the RVR is 6,000 feet or
       less. The lowest reported RVR is ―less than 1,000 feet‖ (M1000). If RVR sensor/system is
       inoperative on the active runway, RVR will be reported as ―RVRNO.‖ The RVR from the
       inactive end of the runway will not be reported in the event that the active end's system is
       inoperative.
       A3.2.5. Temperature and dew point. Reported to the nearest degree Celsius. An ―M‖
       preceding the number indicates a negative temperature (e.g. M05 is -5C).

                    transmitted worldwide in degrees from true north (the correction factor at EAFB is 20
                    degrees) with speed in knots. The direction in degrees can be compared to a compass
                    divided into 16ths with the winds coming from the direction provided (north winds are from
                    0 or 360 degrees, northeast winds are from 45 degrees, east winds are from 90 degrees, etc.).
                    A3.2.7. Altimeter Setting (ALSTG) and Pressure Altitude (PA). Readings of current
                    atmospheric pressure measured in inches of mercury and feet above standard sea level
                    pressure, respectively.
                    A3.2.8. Corrections. Corrections will be made anytime the observation contains an error and
                    another observation has not been sent. The remark ―COR‖ will follow the time of the
                    observation.
             A3.3. Types of Surface Weather Observations. The following types of observations are taken
             (by either the FMQ-19 or certified observer) and augmented/disseminated locally by the weather
             technician:
                    A3.3.1. Record Observation (METAR). This observation is taken 15 minutes before each

                       FORECAST COMPONENTS AND CRITERIA

A4.1. Elements of a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). A TAF contains several elements
and applies to the area within a 5 statute mile radius of the runway complex. A TAF is issued
every 8 hours and is valid for a 24-hour period. EAFB TAF file times are 0400Z, 1200Z, and
2000Z. Each TAF must be transmitted no later than 15 minutes past the file time and will
specify the time of occurrence to the nearest hour, duration, and intensity (where applicable) of
expected weather conditions. Guidance for this product is specified in AFMAN 15-124 and
AMC supplements. See instruction at the end of this attachment for a specific breakdown of the
TAF code. Attachment 4, Section A.4.1.2 contains a decoding of forecast weather phenomena.
These same codes are used to encode observations. A TAF will contain the forecast for the
winds, visibility and weather restricting that visibility, clouds to include ceilings, turbulence (to
include low-level wind shear) or icing affecting Category II aircraft (as defined in AFWA TN-
98/002, Table 2-7, Pages 2-21), minimum altimeter setting, and maximum/minimum
temperatures. Forecast heights are identified in feet above ground level (AGL), as appropriate.
Additionally, each line can contain remarks to better clarify the weather forecast. The first line
of every TAF will reflect conditions at the time of transmission. A Routine Transmission
Delayed (RTD) remark will preface the file time of any scheduled TAF if the transmission is
delayed beyond 15 minutes past the file time. Additional lines are required in a TAF whenever
the following is expected to occur and will be prefaced by BECMG (becoming by time
specified), FM (from time specified), or TEMPO (temporarily) remarks with the time of
expected occurrence and duration:
   A4.1.1. Wind. Speed, including gusts (when wind speeds are 10 knots or more and the gust
   exceeds the sustained winds by 10 knots or more), is forecast to be different by 10 knots or
   more, or the direction will change by more than 30 degrees when the speed (including gusts),
   is above 15 knots.
   A4.1.2. Prevailing visibility. Forecast to decrease to less than or, if below, increases to equal
   or exceed 3 statute miles, 2 statute miles, 1 statute mile, or 1/2 statute mile.
   A4.1.3. Precipitation and/or thunderstorm. Forecast to begin or end.
   A4.1.4. Ceiling. Forecast to decrease to less than or, if below, increase to equal or exceed
   3,000 feet, 1,000 feet, 300 feet, or 200 feet.
   A4.1.5. Aircraft icing or turbulence that is moderate or greater in intensity. For Category II
   aircraft (the KC-135 is a Category II aircraft) not associated with thunderstorms, from the
   surface to 10,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL).
   A4.1.6. Low-level wind shear. Not associated with thunderstorms.
   A4.1.7. Any elements that are in a Weather Warning and can be forecast in a TAF.
   A4.1.8. Remarks: There can be remarks about any condition that in the judgment of weather
   personnel are significant to airfield operations to include those beyond 5 SM of the runway
   (surface-based partial obscurations, precipitation to west, etc.). On the last line of the TAF in
   the remarks section, if the weather station is scheduled to close for any length of time, a
   remark ―LAST NO AMDS AFT D1D1T1T1 NEXT DDTT,‖ where D1D1 denotes the day the
 54                                                      354FWI15-101 13 DECEMBER 2011


   station closes; T1T1 denotes the time the station closes; DD denotes the day the station
   reopens; TT denotes the time the station reopens. For example, LAST NO AMDS AFT
   2512 NEXT 2818 is translated as the station closes on the 25th of month at 12Z and reopens
   on the 28th at 18Z. Additionally, a remark to list any amendment times (AMD 0205
   indicates an amendment at 0205Z) or corrections (COR 0205 indicates a correction at 0205Z)
   will be the last remark of any TAF so affected. In a corrected amendment, AMD COR 0205
   indicates a correction to an amendment at 0205Z.
A4.2. Forecast Amendment Criteria. Weather personnel will ensure that the TAF is always
representative of actual conditions. They will amend the TAF when the conditions described
below occur and were not forecast, or were forecast and did not occur, and the occurrence or lack
of occurrence lasts for 30 minutes or more.
   A4.2.1. Weather warning criteria. Amend when warning criteria are not in the original
   forecast, and the criteria have occurred or a weather warning has been issued. An
   amendment will also be issued when the criteria are included in the forecast and the weather
   warning was canceled. If the potential for the criteria continues to exist, the weather warning
   will remain issued and the TAF will not be amended unless it does not contain the criteria.
   A4.2.2. Ceiling/prevailing visibility. Decreases to less than or, if below, increases to equal
   or exceed 3,000 feet/3 statue miles, 1,000 feet/2 statute miles, 300 feet/1 statue mile, or 200-
   feet/1/2-statue mile.
   A4.2.3. Wind. Observed winds are 10 knots different from the forecast wind speed
   (including gusts) or the wind direction changes by more than 30 degrees when the observed
   or forecast wind speed (including gusts) are expected to be over 15 knots. For a forecast
   wind of 23012G17KT, an amendment will be issued if the direction changes by more than 30
   degrees or if the speeds were 2 knots (or less) or 22 knots (or more) sustained; 7 knots (or
   less) or 27 knots (or more) gusts.
   A4.2.4. Unforecast freezing precipitation. Begins or ends.
   A4.2.5. Aircraft icing or turbulence (for CAT II aircraft). Beginning or ending, not
   associated with thunderstorms, from surface to 10,000 feet MSL which first meets, exceeds,
   or decreases below moderate or greater thresholds.
   A4.2.6. Low-level wind shear. Not associated with thunderstorms is occurring and is
   expected to continue, or is expected to begin.
   A4.2.7. Thunderstorms. Incorrect start or ending times.
   A4.2.8. Representativeness. The forecaster determines the forecast to no longer be
   representative of the existing or expected conditions, even though it may not meet formal
   amendment thresholds.
   A4.2.9. TEMPO (temporary) group. Becomes predominant (lasts for more than an hour [1
   hour and 15 minutes for thunderstorms] and occurs 1/2 or more of the entire period) or
   doesn’t occur at all.

                     CHEMICAL DOWNWIND MESSAGE FORMAT

Upon request from CE Readiness, or any other exercising agency, we provide chemical
downwind messages (CDM). This message is used much like a toxic corridor. It is a forecast of
winds, stability, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and weather.

A chemical downwind message is valid for 6 hours and broken into three parts:

(W) Whiskey – first 2 hours of the forecast
(X) X-ray – second through fourth hour of the forecast
(Y) Yankee – fourth through sixth hour of the forecast

(a) Example of a chemical downwind message:

11 NOV 0600Z-1200Z

X120010418742
Y120010418742

Decoded CDM:

W120010418742 – Surface wind direction (direction blowing to)
W120010418742 – Maximum surface wind speed in kilometers per hour (use conversion chart
below)
W120010418742 – Air stability category…rather subjective (use stability codes below)
W120010418742 – Average temperature- for negative temps add 50 i.e., -03C=53
W120010418742 – Average relative humidity (use RH codes below)
W120010418742 – Significant weather phenomena (use phenomena codes below)
W120010418742 – Cloud cover (use cloud cover codes below)

                          EFFECTIVE DOWNWIND MESSAGE FORMAT
Upon request from CE Readiness, or any other exercising agency, we provide effective downwind messages (EDM).
This message is a bulletin prepared by AFWA with forecasted wind speed and direction to determine where and
when nuclear fallout will travel. EDM’s are issued twice daily at approximately 0500Z and 1700Z and valid for 12-
72 hours.

Procedures: EDMs are located under the ―FUAK‖ bulletin header for PAEI.
