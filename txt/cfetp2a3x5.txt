PART I

PREFACE

1. Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). This CFETP is a comprehensive education
and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 2A3X5, Advanced Fighter Aircraft Integrated
Avionics F-22/F-35/MQ-1/RQ-4/MQ-9 specialty. The 2A3X5 AFSC aligns the fifth generation fighter
aircraft and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) that have similar training and experience requirements
under one AFSC to better meet the needs of operational units. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear
career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training. This CFETP supersedes
CFETP 2A3X2, 1 November 2010. The official CFETP can be found at the Air Force E-Publishing
website: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/ . NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part
II to support duty position qualification training.

2. CFETP Parts. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors will use both parts to plan, manage,
and control training.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training decisions, CCAF, and career field path. Section C associates each skill level
with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates resource
constraints to accomplishing this plan, such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E
identifies transition training plans for the career field.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A provides an explanation of AETC course objectives and
trained proficiency levels. Section B identifies available support materials, such as Qualification Training
Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training. Section C identifies a training
course index that supervisors can use to determine if resources are available to support training. Included
here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section D identifies MAJCOM unique training
requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification
needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Section E identifies the Specialty Training Standard
(STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course/core task, and Career Development Course (CDC)
requirements.

PART 1

SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders,
training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and
efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade,
qualification, advanced and proficiency training. The CFETP also:

1.1. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training
delivery method.

1.2. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field
training process.

2. Use of the CFETP: This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, Training Detachment
(TD), and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II
of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the
resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy these
identified requirements. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for
inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of
courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
The AETC training manager for AFSC 2A3X5 will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC
and MFM to ensure currency and accuracy. The using MAJCOM representatives and AETC training
personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses
in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an
effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual
receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.

2.2. Apprentice (3-level): Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to
enhance their knowledge and skills. They will utilize the Career Development Courses, Qualification
Training, and available exportable courses for continued advancement. Once task certified, a trainee may
perform the task unsupervised. Apprentices can be considered for appointment as unit trainers.

2.3. Journeyman (5-level): Individuals must complete formal 5-level OJT training. This training
involves completion of the 2A355X CDCs, as well as completion of all identified core task qualification
training and any other required duty position training. Journeymen may be assigned job positions such as
quality assurance and various staff positions. Journeymen will be considered for appointment as unit
trainers after completion of the Air Force Training Course. Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for
promotion testing. They should also consider continuing their education toward a Community College of
the Air Force (CCAF) degree.

any other required duty position training. A 7-level can expect to fill various supervisory and
management positions such as shift leader, element chief, flight/section chief, and task certifier. They can
also be assigned to work in staff positions. Craftsmen should take courses to obtain added knowledge on
management of resources and personnel. Continued academic education through CCAF and higher
degree programs is encouraged. The AFSC shred is removed at the 7-skill level, at which point airframe
qualifications are identified by Special Equipment Identifier (SEI) codes. Shred identifiers and SEI codes
are provided in the ECD

2.5. Superintendent (9-level/CEM): A 9-level can be expected to fill positions such as flight NCOIC,
production supervisor, and various staff NCOIC jobs. Additional training in the areas of budget,
manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.
Individuals promoted to MSgt will complete the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy prior to
assuming the rank of SMSgt. Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career
AFSC are also highly encouraged.

3. Training Decisions:

 3.1. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum
of training requirements for the Advanced Fighter Aircraft Integrated Avionics career field. The spectrum
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. The strategy must
ensure we develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to
training. The following training decisions were made by the AFCFM, and MAJCOM Functional
Managers at the career field RPA and F-22 Utilization and Training Workshops held at Sheppard AFB
TX, 9-18 May 2012.

3.2. Initial Skills: The new 2A3X5 AFSC will have a separate 3-skill level awarding course dedicated to
each shred. The A-shred/F-22 course will be approximately 77 days long with a 35 day prerequisite
Avionics Fundamentals course. The C-shred/Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) course will be
approximately 74 days long with a 35 day prerequisite Avionics Fundamentals course identical to the F-
22. The B-shred/F-35 course is still in development at printing.

3.3. Five-Level Upgrade Training: The general portion of the 5-level CDCs will consist of one
volume. The aircraft systems portions will consist of three volumes for the A-shred (5 total) and two
volumes for the C-shred (4 total). Upgrade requirements also include completion of core tasks and
identified work center requirements for their assigned weapons system.

3.4. Seven-Level Upgrade Training: Completion of the 3-volume 2A375 CDC was incorporated as a
7-level upgrade requirement. The requirement to complete the 2AX7X CDC was removed. Airmen in
upgrade training for 2A375 7-level will be task qualified on all core tasks and identified work center
requirements for their assigned weapons system.

3.5. Continuation Training: The purpose of the continuation training program is to provide additional
training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty
positions. To define and standardize this training, MAJCOMs develop continuation training programs that
ensure individuals in the avionic career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their
career. The training program should identify both mandatory and optional training requirements. After

PART II

SECTION A—SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

1. Implementation: The STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and Training
Command. The STS is organized in attachments to this document for “General” training requirements
(applicable to all MDS), and individual attachments for each MDS, Pods and Avionics Fundamentals.

2. Purpose: As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS (Refer to applicable attachments):

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge,
and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. All
task/knowledge taught in the initial skills courses will be taught in the wartime initial skills courses.

2.2. Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks), by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.
Certification on all shop/flightline core tasks applicable to at least one Mission Design Series (MDS)
aircraft assigned must be completed for skill level upgrade. When a base has multiple MDSs or blocks
assigned, trainees are only required to complete core task training on MDSs or blocks assigned to their
unit of assignment.

2.3. Column 3 provides certification for OJT. It is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification/completed date.

2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes) show formal training and correspondence course requirements and
shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. When two codes are
used in columns 4A and 4B (e.g. 2b/b), the first code is the established requirement for resident training
on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of training provided in the course due to
equipment shortages or other resource constraints. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the
unit-training manager for current CDC listing.

3. Qualitative Requirements: Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

4. Job Qualification Standard: The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job
training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.
For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual
can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct
procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

4.1 Documentation. Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201. Automated
records, utilizing MIS reflecting this STS is highly encouraged

4.1.1. Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP. All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are
replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.



                                                     16
                                                                            CFETP 2A3X5, 1 January 2013


Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.
Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.

5. Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT). The STS serves as a guide for development of promotion tests
used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). SKTs are developed at the USAF
Occupational Measurement Squadron, by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career
fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references
listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program.
WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.

6. Recommendations: Report, through the Graduate Assessment Survey, unsatisfactory performance of
individual course graduates to the AETC Training Manager at 365 TRS/TRR, 609 9th Avenue Rm. 135,
Sheppard AFB, TX 76311-2335, DSN 736-7901. Please reference specific STS paragraphs.


SECTION B – 3-LEVEL COURSE OBJECTIVES

1. Introduction. Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is
measured through the use of an objective. An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she
knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task. Each objective is
comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard that states what is expected of the student for each task.
The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc). The
behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check). The standard is the
level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained (i.e. “with no
more than two instructor assists”).

2. Objective Measurement. Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured. All
objectives using the PC code indicate a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge. W
indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of
a block of instruction. PC/W indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate
measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.

3. Objective Standard. The standard for written examinations is 70%. Standards for performance
objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.
The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress, on each task. Instructor
assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or
part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. Students must satisfactorily complete all
PCs prior to taking the written test.

4. Proficiency Level. Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular
task or knowledge item. Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section A of this CFETP for an
explanation of the proficiency codes. Most task performance is taught to the ‘2b’ proficiency level which
means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task
(partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.
