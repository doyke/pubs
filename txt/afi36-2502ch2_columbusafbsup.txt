selection board recommendations and may elect not to use the full quota of promotions.
2.2.2.3. (Added)     The Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) provides program direction
and guidance, to include coordinating on all correspondence/information on the program. The
CCM coordinates with the Military Personnel Section (MPS), Career Development Section, on

board president and four members. The CCM will be the board president or, in the absence of

2.2.2.4. (Added)      The MPS determines the base-wide quota distribution with a 15 percent
selection rate each cycle. The MPS Superintendent approves the distribution. For supplemental
BTZ promotion to SrA, the MPS forwards a request by message to HQ AFPC/DPSOE for those
not previously considered.
2.3. MPS Identify Eligibles:
2.3.1.8. (Added) MPS will coordinate with the CCM by the second week of January, April,
July and October, on the number of promotion quotas, which units earn their own promotion
quotas, and when and where the base central selection board shall take place. The central
selection board will normally convene on/about the 18th day of the third month of each quarter,
i.e., March, June, September and December.
2.3.1.9. (Added)     Determine if large units (with seven or more eligible) will receive quotas
and make selections at unit level, and if so, will provide any affected units with quota(s).
2.3.1.10. (Added) Two months prior to the board, distribute BTZ unit eligibility rosters and
notify squadrons of the number of promotion quotas to be considered by the central selection
board.
2.3.1.11. (Added) Collect eligibility rosters from squadrons two weeks prior to board.
2.3.1.12. (Added) Notify squadrons of the date, time and place of the board at least two weeks
in advance of the board.
2.3.1.13. (Added)      Suspense units to forward completed nomination packages on each
nominee to arrive at the MPS two weeks prior to board convening.
2.3.1.14. (Added) As soon as possible after suspense date, determine if all nominees can meet
the board. Coordinate findings with the CCM and nominating units. If one or more nominees
cannot meet the board, a records-only board will be held.
2.3.2.3. (Added) One week prior to the board, 14 FSS/FSMPD will prepare a nomination
folder on each nominee to include a BTZ RIP, copies of all decoration citations, Individual
Fitness Assessment History and the AF IMT 1206, Nomination for Award limited to 18 lines,
including the headings.

alternates to be identified should selectees become ineligible for promotion.
2.3.4. (Added) Squadron Commanders:
2.3.4.1. (Added) Will use the unit eligibility list to identify nominees for BTZ promotion
consideration. An appropriate evaluation process should be used to determine nominees: unit
boards, records review, supervisor or first sergeant recommendation, etc.
2.3.4.2. (Added) Will consider all individuals meeting time in service (TIS) and time in grade
(TIG) requirements, even if they are TDY, on leave, or have a report not later than date
(RNLTD) on or after the first day of the first month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct) for the quarter
selections. Coordinate any availability issue through the CCM office.
2.3.4.3. (Added)         Review each Airman’s EPR(s), their personnel record via the Records

meet a unit or base central selection board. Underline the name of their nominee(s) on the unit
eligibility list, identify if the nominee(s) will physically be available to meet the central selection
board, sign the listing and return it to the MPS by the suspense date.

nominee. Use the following headings in the body of the nomination: Leadership and
Performance of Primary Duty; Significant Self-Improvement; and Base and Community
Involvement. Limit write-up to 18 lines, including headings. The write-up should cover
accomplishments that occurred prior to the suspense date of nomination packages to the MPS.
Use bullet format with thorough, but succinct statements.

for a unit BTZ board.
2.3.5. (Added) First Sergeants:
2.3.5.1. (Added) Inform each eligible individual on Part I and Part II of the unit listing to
review their RRL via vMPF to verify all data is accurate and complete. Instruct individuals they
 4                             AFI36-2502CH2_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 21 FEBRUARY 2013


must correct any erroneous data prior to the board convening. Only instruct individuals on Part
III of the unit listing to review their RRL if during review it is found the ineligible condition is
invalid and the member later becomes eligible.
2.3.5.2. (Added) Submit 5 copies of all decoration citations, Individual Fitness Assessment
History and the AF IMT 1206, Nomination for Award, to 14 FSS/FSMPD NLT established
suspense date.

central selection board or there will be a records-only board. A records-only board should be
considered when any nominee has PCS’d, will be TDY, deployed, emergency leave, quarters or
hospitalized on the date of the central selection board.
2.4.1.4. (Added) If a unit meets the requirements for a unit board, the board president will be
the squadron superintendent.
2.4.1.5. (Added) The board president will notify each board member of any changes to the
date, time and type of board. He or she will also ensure the fair and equal consideration of each
nominee.
2.4.1.5. (Added) Selection is based on the ―whole person‖ scoring of the AF IMT 1206,
Nomination for Award, decoration citations, and the BTZ RIP using a 6- to 10-point scale in .5
increments. This score will be used by individual board members to provide an order of merit, 1
through XX to the board president. Individual board members must break all ties to develop a
clear order of merit. Be mindful that a well-rounded, top performer must have participated in
Significant Self- Improvement and Base and Community Involvement.
2.4.1.5. (Added)    Uniform for all board members and nominees is the Service Dress Uniform
(Class A).
2.4.1.6. (Added)    Question Structure: Questions will consist of fact-based opinionated
answers (e.g., What is the Air Force Policy on tongue splitting? How do you feel about the
policy?)
2.4.1.7. (Added) Questions will come from the following areas:
2.4.1.7.1. (Added) Current Events.
2.4.1.7.2. (Added) AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development Guide.

2.4.1.7.9. (Added) The unit commander will notify the CCM and the Military Personnel
Section, Career Development office, via a Non-recommendation Memorandum if a BTZ selectee
becomes ineligible for promotion due to any quality force indicators (e.g., 2 or less EPR rating,
referral EPR, or failed Fitness Assessment). This must be accomplished prior to, but NLT, the
promotion effective date.
2.4.1.7.10. (Added) The MPS will remove a BTZ selectee from the list upon receipt of a Non-
recommendation memorandum from a unit commander. The first alternate selectee will be
promoted. If the first alternate selectee’s BTZ Date of Rank (DOR) has past, they will receive
the original BTZ DOR and effective date of the commander’s approval. The MPS will assist the
Airman in applying for a retroactive promotion effective date to HQ AFPC/DPSOE according to
AFI 36-2502, paragraph 1.12.
