                                    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction.
   1.1.1. This instruction implements the policies outlined in AFI 21-105, Aerospace Equipment Struc-
   tural Maintenance, and provides guidance for applying command approved aircraft markings.
   1.1.2. Forms Prescribed. AMC Forms 696-2, 700, 702, 704, and 706, AMC and AFRC Emblems
   (aircraft decals) can be requisitioned per paragraph 2.2.1.

1.2. Policy.
   1.2.1. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard markings will be applied in accordance with
   the applicable aircraft technical order, aircraft drawings, TO 1-1-8, Application of Organic Coatings
   and this instruction.
   1.2.2. Deviations from standard markings are authorized for 89 AW aircraft when approved by HQ
   USAF.
   1.2.3. Approval authority for optional markings. Final approval will come from the authority listed
   below. All levels of supervision have the responsibility to review the markings for tastefulness, appro-
   priateness, and adherence to copyright laws. Refer to Chapter 4 for further guidance.
       1.2.3.1. Nose Art: AMC/A4. E-mail request with wing CC approval, justification, and the design
       to mailto:amc.a4.aircraftmarkings@amc.af.mil.
       1.2.3.2. Tail Flash: AMC/A4. E-mail request with wing CC approval, justification, and the design
       to mailto:amc.a4.aircraftmarkings@amc.af.mil.
       1.2.3.3. Aircraft names (“City of” or “Spirit of” type markings): AF/CV. Route request through
       your wing CC to AMC/PA.
       1.2.3.4. Deleted
   1.2.4. All aircraft markings will be maintained intact, legible, and distinct in color (not faded). Com-
   mand standardization of markings (by mission design and series (MDS)) is of primary concern.
   1.2.5. When large sections of an aircraft are repainted (i.e., entire wing, fuselage, or empennage) they
   will be documented in GO81 and the individual AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data for
   tracking purposes.
   1.2.6. All exterior aircraft markings must match the gloss level of the basecoat. No approved diffuse
   clearcoats are available; low-gloss materials must be used for all markings on aircraft with lusterless
   paint schemes.
   1.2.7. Operational markings and structural coating/corrosion maintenance will take precedence over
   cosmetic refinements; markings, such as nose art, tail flash, and DCC names should be considered
   lowest priority work.
   1.2.8. Units participating in competitions, such as the Airlift Rodeo, will follow the guidelines estab-
   lished in the competition rules for aircraft appearance. Polishing bare metal surfaces and applying
   “commander” type markings specifically designed for competitions are prohibited.
4                                                                      AMCI21-105 11 MARCH 2004


    1.2.9. All optional markings must be removed from aircraft prior to transfer to other units. This does
    not apply to aircraft retiring to Aerospace Maintenance and Registration Center (AMARC). If an air-
    craft is to be permanently transferred to another MAJCOM, remove all organizational and MAJCOM
    insignia, unit identifiers, AFRC associate wing markings, AMC tail stripes, and all other optional
    markings. Aircraft scheduled for repaint in conjunction with programmed depot maintenance (PDM)
    need not have markings removed prior to aircraft departure. NOTE: All markings, including nose art,
    will be destroyed during depot repaint operations.

                                 AIRCRAFT MARKING METHODS

2.1. Stencils. Stencils may be used to apply all exterior markings. Apply stenciled markings with poly-
urethane, MIL-PRF-85285, type I or II. Prepackaged aerosol paints are not authorized for permanent air-
craft markings.

2.2. Decals. Decals may be applied to aircraft interiors and exteriors IAW TO 1-1-8. Requisition decals
through the air base group (ABG) at the air logistics center (ALC) having maintenance management
responsibility IAW TO 1-1-8, or Sacramento DAPS. Exterior color aircraft decals have a one-year shelf
life (adhesive film on the back) after manufacture; units will limit the quantity ordered to not more than a
one-year supply.
   2.2.1. AMC and AFRC decals are approved for aircraft application. Application of aircraft decals to
   non-aircraft equipment is prohibited. Decals should be requested through the Air Force Publication
   Distribution Center (AFPDC) web site at http://afpubs.hq.af.mil/onlineorder/default.asp. Users
   should use their organization’s account (MXG, AMXS, or equivalent); those without an account must
   request one via AF Form 1846, Request for and Record of Organizational Account (paper or elec-
   tronic) before placing orders. Instructions for completing AF Form 1846 are found on the AFPDC
   web site. Refer to Table 2.1. for applicable form numbers.

2.3. Silk-screening. The silk-screen printing process is approved for applying markings and insignia.
Only areas free from protruding bolts, screws, rivets, or complex contours should be silk-screened. If
used, silk-screen equipment will be procured using local purchase procedures (AFMAN 23-110) with
organizational and maintenance (O&M) funds.

2.4. Vinyl appliqués. Appliqués such as those used with computerized stencil cutters are approved for
application on AMC aircraft in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Finish must match the
gloss level of the basecoat.

                                      MANDATORY MARKINGS

3.1. Letters and Numerals. Any style font/letter comparable to vertical block letters and Arabic numer-
als will be used when applying mandatory markings to AMC aircraft, IAW TO 1-1-8.

3.2. Standard Air Force Markings. Mandatory markings will be applied IAW TO 1-1-8 and the appli-
cable table in this instruction. For identification, placement, and color of mandatory markings other than
those identified in this instruction, refer to the weapon system technical orders and system drawings.
    3.2.1. US Flag. Paint may be used only when high-quality templates or silk-screen processes are used.
    Flag decals can be obtained by submitting a DD Form 843, Requisition for Printing and Binding
    Service to Document Automation & Production Service (DAPS), 3200 Howard Street, McClellan
    AFB CA 95652-1335, (916) 643-4952, FAX (916) 643-2947 (or use Beale AFB operator at DSN
    368-1110 and ask for an off-base line for official call). Flag decals may be purchased with the Interna-
    tional Merchant Purchasing Authorization Card (IMPAC) card. The DoD Form 843 should be submit-
    ted directly from the requesting unit to DAPS. There is no form number or part number for flag decals;
    therefore a “short title” should be used. The short title is either “21-inch by 40-inch Matte Finish Flag
    Decal” or “24-inch by 48-inch Matte Finish Flag Decal,” as applicable. Flag decals have a one-year
    shelf life. For best results, use 3M edge sealer part # 4150 (designed for polyester decal films)

3.3. Standard AMC Markings:
    3.3.1. Command Insignia (Emblem).
    3.3.2. “AMC” Tail Letters.
    3.3.3. AMC Tail Stripes.
    3.3.4. Parent Wing Unit Identifier.
    3.3.5. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Associate Wing Unit Designator and Emblem. Active
    duty units with attached AFRC associate wings will apply the AFRC emblem and reserve unit identi-
    fier on their aircraft. In coordination with AFRC, AMC-gained reserve units will apply AMC
    emblems to their aircraft.

                                        OPTIONAL MARKINGS

4.1. Letters and Numerals. These markings may be applied using any style letter/numeral (font)
deemed appropriate by the wing commander. Size and location must remain standardized for all
wing-assigned aircraft.

4.2. Optional Markings. When used, the following optional markings will be applied IAW the tables in
this instruction. Changes/standardization of optional markings may be done on an attrition basis to mini-
mize workload, aircraft availability, and environmental impact.
    4.2.1. Nose art is authorized on one aircraft per flying squadron, plus the wing pride aircraft. Addi-
    tionally, one aircraft per wing may have the “Let’s Roll” graphic applied as nose art; it may be on one
    of the above aircraft, or in addition to the above aircraft. Nose art is not permitted on any aircraft fly-
    ing missions where local populations may consider it sensitive or offensive. Art will reflect a theme of
    civic and community pride, be distinctive, symbolic, and designed and maintained to the highest qual-
    ity standards. Positioning of nose art is at the discretion of the wing commander; however, it must be
    forward of the wing leading edge and not interfere with any mandatory markings. Nose art should be
    approximately two-thirds the size of the fuselage national star insignia, not to exceed three feet in
    diameter. All nose art applied to wing aircraft will be of standard size and location. Nose art and tail
    flash designs must be approved prior to installation; see paragraph 1.2.3. AMC-gained AFRC units
    will comply with HQ AFRC nose art guidance.
       4.2.1.1. On aircraft with lusterless paint schemes, nose art and tail flash must be applied using lus-
       terless paint and/or decals.
    4.2.2. Aircraft Names are authorized on AMC aircraft only after approval by USAF/CV, IAW AFI
    21-105, “Aerospace Equipment Structural Maintenance” and TO 1-1-8. The proposed name must
    either have a national or military theme or honor a locale adjacent to an AMC base or aircraft manu-
    facturing point. Route recommendations through your wing CC to AMC/PA; include the proposed
    name and detailed justification. If applied in addition to nose art, the aircraft name and nose art must
    be complementary; the font, size, and location may be changed to complement the nose art.
    4.2.3. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA) may be applied if applicable. AFOUA
    decals, with and without oak leaf clusters, are available from DAPS, McClellan CA 95652 (see para-
    graph 3.2.1.).
    4.2.4. Boom elevator markings may be applied IAW the appropriate table with the approval of the
    wing commander.
    4.2.5. Each wing commander may designate one aircraft to be the wing pride aircraft; this aircraft is
    authorized the additional markings stated below.
       4.2.5.1. Wing CC/CV names and Group Commander’s names (list all group commanders or
       none) may be used in place of the DCC names. The wing designator may be included in the name
       block.
       4.2.5.2. Tail Flash may contain colors/numbers of all the squadrons assigned to the wing, but must
       remain within the tail band stripes specified in the applicable table.
AMCI21-105 11 MARCH 2004                                                                                  9


      4.2.5.3. Wing mascot/logo may be applied as nose art (in addition to the one per flying squadron),
      Paragraphs 1.2.3. and 4.2.1. apply.

      4.2.5.4. Delete
   4.2.6. Dedicated Crew Chief (DCC) and assistant DCC names will be applied IAW TO 1-1-8 and the
   appropriate table in this instruction and removed prior to deployment or flight into combat zones
   (including transient aircraft). AMC/A4 or MXG/CCs are authorized to direct the removal of all names
   for the duration of contingency operations. The name will consist of the abbreviated rank, first name,
   and last name. The first name can be either the given proper name (William, Robert, Daniel, etc.) or
   the more familiar shorter form (Bill, Bob, Dan, etc.). The use of an individual’s middle name or initial
   is optional. For extremely long names, it is permissible to use the individual’s rank, first initial, and
   last name or to use smaller letters to accommodate the entire name. Nicknames are not authorized.
   Size and font are at the wing CC’s discretion; size not to exceed 2 ½ inches; standardized within the
   wing. Crew chief names will be placed in a block with a 1-inch wide outline, black in color. Unit mas-
   cot graphics, i.e., razorback and eagle head (outlines or silhouettes) may be used as the forward edge
   of the block in lieu of a 1-inch vertical black line. For standardization purposes, either all or none of
   the wing aircraft will bear the graphic. No background color is authorized. Names may be applied
   with vinyl letters or by stencil (use spray gun or roller) using Mil-PRF-85285 (standard aircraft exte-
   rior polyurethane paint) or latex paint.
   4.2.7. AMU/Squadron/Wing Colors. Each operational squadron may have its colors and/or logos
   applied within the boundaries of the tail stripes, or the entire wing may share one tail stripe design.
   4.2.8. Table 4.1. through Table 4.7. list the size, location and color of markings by aircraft type.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This interim change (IC) 04-1 provides guidance for approval of aircraft nose art and tail flash markings.

1.2.3.1. Nose Art: AMC/A4. E-mail request with wing CC approval, justification, and the design to
mailto:amc.a4.aircraftmarkings@amc.af.mil.

1.2.3.2. Tail Flash: AMC/A4. E-mail request with wing CC approval, justification, and the design to
mailto:amc.a4.aircraftmarkings@amc.af.mil.

1.2.3.4. Deleted

4.2.1. Nose art is authorized on one aircraft per flying squadron, plus the wing pride aircraft. Additionally,
one aircraft per wing may have the “Let’s Roll” graphic applied as nose art; it may be on one of the above
aircraft, or in addition to the above aircraft. Nose art is not permitted on any aircraft flying missions where
local populations may consider it sensitive or offensive. Art will reflect a theme of civic and community
pride, be distinctive, symbolic, and designed and maintained to the highest quality standards. Positioning
of nose art is at the discretion of the wing commander; however, it must be forward of the wing leading
edge and not interfere with any mandatory markings. Nose art should be approximately two-thirds the
size of the fuselage national star insignia, not to exceed three feet in diameter. All nose art applied to wing
aircraft will be of standard size and location. Nose art and tail flash designs must be approved prior to
installation; see paragraph 1.2.3. AMC-gained AFRC units will comply with HQ AFRC nose art guid-
ance.

4.2.6. Dedicated Crew Chief (DCC) and assistant DCC names will be applied IAW TO 1-1-8 and the
appropriate table in this instruction and removed prior to deployment or flight into combat zones (includ-
ing transient aircraft). AMC/A4 or MXG/CCs are authorized to direct the removal of all names for the
duration of contingency operations. The name will consist of the abbreviated rank, first name, and last
name. The first name can be either the given proper name (William, Robert, Daniel, etc.) or the more
familiar shorter form (Bill, Bob, Dan, etc.). The use of an individual’s middle name or initial is optional.
For extremely long names, it is permissible to use the individual’s rank, first initial, and last name or to
use smaller letters to accommodate the entire name. Nicknames are not authorized. Size and font are at the
wing CC’s discretion; size not to exceed 2 ½ inches; standardized within the wing. Crew chief names will
be placed in a block with a 1-inch wide outline, black in color. Unit mascot graphics, i.e., razorback and
eagle head (outlines or silhouettes) may be used as the forward edge of the block in lieu of a 1-inch verti-
cal black line. For standardization purposes, either all or none of the wing aircraft will bear the graphic.
