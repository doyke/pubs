SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a substantially revised publication and should be reviewed in its entirety.
1. General Information: This directive ensures that Federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) and Oklahoma Department of Labor Safety and Health inspectors are
allowed access to Tinker AFB to determine the adequacy of AF and contractor’s safety and
health programs. This instruction also establishes procedures to ensure inspectors are escorted as
required by AF and AFMC directives, and specifies out-briefing procedures.
2. Procedure: The 72d ABW Safety Office (72 ABW/SE) is responsible for all matters relative
to visits by Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) inspectors and must be notified in a timely
manner when such visits are known. The Wing Commander (72 ABW/CC) or the affected
organizational chief/commander will receive OSH inspection in- and out-briefings and sign
correspondence relative to OSH information requests and visits.
     2.1. The 72d ABW Safety Office (72 ABW/SE) will:
        2.1.1. Provide a Safety official to escort the Federal or State DOL OSH inspector.
        2.1.2. Determine the nature of the visit, notify the wing and/or OC-ALC Commanders,
        and ascertain if the Commander or the affected organizational chief/commander desires
        an in-briefing.
        2.1.3. Notify Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (72 AMDS/SGPB), Fire Chief (72
        ABW/CEF) or 76th Maintenance Wing Safety (76 MXW/SE), as warranted by the nature
        of the inspection, and escort the inspector to the appropriate office.

        further ensure proper clearance/escort into controlled/restricted areas.
        2.1.8. Ensure pictures are only taken of contractor operations and personnel. Otherwise,
        provide photographic or video support, if required, IAW AFI 91301, Para 10.1.2, which
        states, ―Videos or photographs taken on installations fall under the exclusive control of
        the installation commander. This video or photographic support might include
        processing the film taken by the inspector or gaining approval to take a picture or video
        from the commander’s representative. Air Force officials may review negatives,
        photographs and videos before release if they suspect possible disclosure of classified
        information without the review.‖
        2.1.9. For bioenvironmental or fire issues or safety issues in 76 MXW, 72 ABW Safety
        personnel will remain with the inspector until another escort from the appropriate area
        can be located.
        2.1.10. Arrange an out-briefing for concerned personnel and the ALC/wing Commander
        or the affected organizational chief/commander. Advise the OC-ALC Commander
