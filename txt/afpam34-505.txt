requested.

    2.1. Remains Transportation.
       2.1.1. You are eligible for the transportation entitlement listed in paragraph 2.1.2 if you
       die while properly admitted to a military medical facility of the armed forces (excludes
       Veterans Administration hospitals) in the United States, to include Alaska, Hawaii, the
       Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other territories and possessions of the United States.
           2.1.1.1. “Properly admitted” means you are placed under treatment or observation
           and you are provided room, board, and continuous nursing service in the area of the
           hospital where patients stay at least overnight.
           2.1.1.2. If you die in the emergency room without being properly admitted, no
           eligibility exists.
           2.1.1.3. Deaths occurring in Veterans Administration hospital after being properly
           admitted may be eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs Death Benefit
           entitlements.
       2.1.2. Transportation provided under this section may not be to a place further from the
       place of death than the decedent’s last place of permanent residence, and any amount
       paid under this section may not exceed the cost of transportation from the place of death
       to the decedent’s last place of permanent residence.
           2.1.2.1. If the place of burial is further distant than your last place of permanent
           residence the Air Force can pay no more than the cost to transport your remains to
           your last place of permanent residence. For example, you live in Orlando, Florida,
           and are visiting Biloxi, Mississippi. You become ill and are properly admitted to the
           Air Force Hospital, Keesler AFB, Mississippi, and subsequently die. You are entitled
           to transportation of your remains back to Orlando, Florida. However, if your NOK
           wants to bury you in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, the Air Force could pay
           no more than what it would have cost to return your remains to Orlando, Florida
           (your permanent address).
    2.2. Authorized Transportation Expenses.
       2.2.1. Removal of remains from place of death or where remains are released by
       authorities to a funeral home selected by your NOK for preparation, dressing, and
       casketing.
       2.2.2. An outer shipping container to protect casket if transportation is by commercial air
       or rail.
       2.2.3. Delivery of remains from the funeral home to a nearby airport or rail station.
       2.2.4. Cost of commercial air carrier or train. The movement of your remains by military
       aircraft in the United States is prohibited by law.
       2.2.5. Delivery of remains from the airport or rail station at destination to the funeral
       home selected by your NOK.
       2.2.6. Delivery of remains from the destination funeral home to the cemetery.
    2.3. Military Funeral Honors.
       2.3.1. The Air Force may provide military honors at your place of burial provided:
AFPAM34-505 15 APRIL 2011                                                                        3


          2.3.1.1. Your NOK or funeral director requests such honors by contacting the
          mortuary officer of the nearest active Air Force base at least 48 hours prior to the
          scheduled time/date of burial.
          2.3.1.2. There is sufficient time allotted to transition a funeral honors detail to the
          place of burial. Remember, the nearest servicing Air Force base may be several
          hundred miles away.
          2.3.1.3. Rendering the desired honors will not interfere with the execution of the
          base’s primary mission.
       2.3.2. Military honors ceremonial elements that may be requested are part of the standard
       Air Force funeral and include the following: pallbearers, firing party, bugler, color guard,
       Air Force chaplain, officer or noncommissioned officer in charge. NOTE: Any one or all
       of the elements may be requested.
          2.3.2.1. Whether the requested elements are provided depends on the capability of
          the base on the day requested.
          2.3.2.2. Should valid conditions or circumstances preclude the base from providing
          the requested honors, that base will, as a last resort, provide one military person to
          represent the Air Force at the place of interment and present the flag to your NOK, if
          requested.
       2.3.3. Flyover. If you served as a 3-star or 4-star general officer or as Chief Master
       Sergeant of the Air Force, or were awarded the Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Army
       Distinguished Service Cross, or Navy Cross, achieved at least one or more officially
       recognized aerial victories, or were a Prisoner of War; your closest NOK may request a
       flyover at the place of burial. The performance of a flyover depends on the availability of
       tactical aircraft at the given time and date, minimum weather requirements, and
       approvals for the required air space.
   2.4. Interment in the USAF Academy Cemetery, Colorado Springs, Colorado. You, your
   spouse, and dependent unmarried children under 21 years of age may be interred in the
   USAF Academy Cemetery provided you are a:
       2.4.1. Graduate of the USAF Academy.
       2.4.2. US Air Force general or lieutenant general.
       2.4.3. Former superintendent, commandant, dean of faculty, chief of staff, appointed

       1955 and 10 September 1957.
3. Veterans Administration (VA) Benefits. You are entitled to certain benefits administered
and extended by the VA. Listed below are VA benefits in general. Should you have specific
questions or circumstances concerning these benefits, please contact your nearest VA office for
assistance. The VA forms and pamphlets discussed in the following paragraphs may be obtained
from the nearest VA office.

     3.1. National Cemetery. You may be interred in a national cemetery, most of which are
     operated by the VA, while Arlington National Cemetery is operated by Department of the
     Army.
        3.1.1. All retirees, their spouses, and unmarried children under 21 years of age are
        eligible for burial in national cemeteries, including Arlington.

        pamphlet #VA-DMA-IS-1, Interments in National Cemeteries, or on the web at:
        www.cem.va.gov.
     3.2. Government Headstone. A government furnished headstone may be obtained to mark
     your grave. There are different styles and types of headstones and certain cemetery
     requirements that must be met. All details concerning these headstones may be found in VA
     Form 40-1330, Application for Standard Government Headstone or Marker for Installation
     in a Private or Local Cemetery.
     3.3. Burial Allowance. Your NOK may receive a small burial allowance from the VA.

     for Veterans and Dependents.
     3.4. Interment Flag. You are entitled to one interment flag to drape your casket, with
     ultimate presentation to your NOK. This flag is furnished by the VA, not the Air Force. The
     funeral director handling your arrangements and conducting your funeral obtains this flag by
     completing a prescribed VA form. The funeral director then gives the form to the nearest
     postmaster who, in turn, gives him/her the flag that will drape your casket.
4. How to Obtain Benefits.
     4.1. If your NOK wants to take advantage of some or all benefits when you die, he or she
     should do the following:
        4.1.1. Call the mortuary officer of the Air Force base nearest you. Inform the mortuary
        officer of the death and request their assistance in obtaining authorized transportation
        entitlements or funeral honors.
        4.1.2. Call a nearby funeral home to care for your remains and conduct desired
        arrangements and services.
     4.2. The mortuary officer will assist your NOK to the extent possible. If you are eligible for
     transportation, the mortuary officer will obtain a signed statement from your NOK listing the
     funeral home(s) selected and place of burial.
     4.3. The mortuary officer will instruct the funeral home(s) on direct billing to the Air Force
     for transportation. The mortuary officer will also arrange for requested honors within the
     base’s capability. If interment will be in another area, the mortuary officer will request the
     nearest base to provide requested honors to the extent possible.
     4.4. Your NOK must give the funeral home the official document (DD Form 214 or
     retirement orders) reflecting pertinent military service data. The document substantiates your
     status as a retiree for Air Force benefits and enables your NOK to obtain VA benefits such as
     interment in a national cemetery, headstone, interment flag, etc.
AFPAM34-505 15 APRIL 2011                                                                    5


   4.5. Your NOK will be responsible for paying any funeral home and cemetery expenses they
   incur.

in Attachment 1. This guide is designed to alleviate undue burden on your family members
upon your death. Take the time to carefully review the information and complete the attachment.
Provide copies of your expressed wishes contained within this attachment to your family
