                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Hazards and Human Factors.
     1.1.1. The safe operation of all government and civilian motor vehicles on the airfield is
     absolutely essential to aircraft operations and maintenance. Motor vehicles present a clear
     and definite danger to both aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard
     for established safety standards by vehicle operators are the primary causes of aircraft
     incidents/accidents, aircraft-vehicle mishaps, and personal injuries on the airfield. NOTE:
     For the purpose of this operating instruction, the term ―airfield‖ includes runways, taxiways,
     aircraft parking ramp/aprons, and associated maintenance/servicing areas where aircraft may
     be encountered.
1.2. General Requirements.
     1.2.1. The standards and directives on the following pages have been established for the
     control of motor vehicles and personnel operating on the airfield. Personnel assigned to the
     airfield will be knowledgeable of and comply with these requirements. Careful attention and
     strict adherence to flight safety precautions will prevent accidental damage to aircraft and
     personnel injury.
1.3. Technical Agreement and Norma de Execução Permanente NEP/OPS – 009 (SOP).
     1.3.1. In accordance with the Technical Agreement on Cooperation and Defense between the
     United States of America and Portugal dated 23 May 2002; the 65 ABW/CC does not have
     sole sovereignty over Lajes AB Airfield. The Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) and its support
     facilities shall be under the Command of the Air Base 4 Commander. The 65 ABW/CC shall
     only exercise command and control over United States equipment/materials and personnel.
     In accordance with NEP/OPS – 009, the PoAF executes the Airfield Driving Program for all

       NOTE: The use of non-standard terminology, such as ―go-ahead‖, ―cleared,‖ or other
       non-essential communications is prohibited due to the possibility of confusing individuals
       operating on airfield frequencies.


3.9. Radio Discipline.
   3.9.1. Due to the variety of frequencies monitored by control tower, it is imperative that all
   individuals use proper and concise terminology. The control tower has ultimate authority
   over all traffic entering the CMA and will issue, by radio or directional light gun signals,
   specific instructions that approve or disapprove the movement of vehicles, equipment or
   personnel in the CMA.
   3.9.2. It is essential to acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using
   appropriate call sign.
   3.9.3. Brevity is important. Radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   Controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their control
   duties. Conversely, vehicle operators must know exactly what the controller wants them to
   do.
LAJESFIELDI13-213                                                                            17


   3.9.4. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
   3.9.5. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time they
   proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
   advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
   intentions are.
   3.9.6. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground control
   and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always give
   aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
   3.9.7. The following example of phraseology will be used when requesting access across or
   in to a controlled movement area:

PROCEDURES                                                       PHRASEOLOGY

Driver: State whom you are calling and who you are               ―Tower, Airfield Two‖
(Use assigned radio call signs to initiate communications)

Control Tower response                                           ―Airfield Two, Tower‖

Driver: State who you are, location, and request                 ―Airfield Two on Foxtrot
                                                                 apron request to cross
                                                                 taxiways Papa and Mike and
                                                                 proceed onto taxiway Juliet‖

Control Tower response                                           "Airfield Two proceed across
                                                                 taxiways Papa, Mike and
                                                                 Juliet. Report when off"

Driver: Read back Control Tower’s instruction                    ―Airfield Two proceeding
                                                                 across taxiways Papa, Mike
                                                                 and Juliet. Will report when
                                                                 off‖

Driver: When out of the CMA Report-when off                      ―Tower Airfield Two off
                                                                 taxiways Papa and Mike‖

Control Tower acknowledgement                                    ―Airfield Two Roger‖

3.9.8. Airfield Management and Air Traffic Control will monitor radios and report improper
radio terminology/phraseology and lack of discipline over the frequency.
 18                                                                     LAJESFIELDI13-213


3.10. Key Phraseology and Points.
   3.10.1. The words ―clear‖, ―clearance‖ or any form thereof shall not be used over the radio
   by personnel operating on the airfield. This may be misunderstood by other vehicles or
   aircraft as permission to perform an action.
   3.10.2. Key words in the control tower’s transmission are PROCEED and HOLD.
   3.10.3. Always repeat the control tower’s directions when operating on or within 150 feet of
   the CMA to confirm the control tower's message was received and correctly understood.
   3.10.4. Notify control tower when leaving the runway by stating, ―Tower, [assigned call
   sign] off the runway at (your present location)‖.
   3.10.5. If tower’s radio transmission is garbled or unreadable DO NOT PROCEED ON THE
   CMA. Hold your position and ask control tower to repeat their last transmission.
   3.10.6. Before asking for permission onto/across the runway, scan the sky for approaching
   aircraft. This will prevent any unnecessary transmission or interruption of ATC services to
   aircraft on final.
3.11. Vehicle Call Signs.
   3.11.1. Vehicles operating in the CMA will be assigned call signs. All vehicle call signs
   must be coordinated through AM to ensure duplicated call signs are not used. All call signs
   will consist of a code word and may have a numerical suffix. The following call signs have
   been approved for use in the CMAs:

       3.13.2. The main Airfield entry point is located between buildings T-715 & T-716 (See
       Attachment 15).
3.14. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
   3.14.1. FOD is everyone’s responsibility. When entering the airfield area through the
   airfield ECP, unpaved surfaces, or FOD checkpoints, vehicle operators will stop and remove
   foreign materials from the tires. Motor vehicles will operate on paved surfaces to the
   maximum extent possible (See attachment 21). Personnel completing a FOD check will:
       3.14.1.1. Conduct a visual check to ensure external vehicle components are secured.
       3.14.1.2. Perform a thorough walk around the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or

   3.14.2. When FOD is observed on the airfield, USAF employed personnel will contact AM
   Ops. AM Ops will immediately contact the sweeper, if necessary.
3.15. Airfield Speed Limits.
   3.15.1. Except for responding emergency response vehicles, the following standards will be
   observed at all times when operating vehicles on the airfield. Emergency vehicles will
   automatically assume the right-of-way.
   Runway                                                         25 MPH (40 Km/h)

   Taxiways                                                       15 MPH (20 Km/h)

3.16. Taxiing Aircraft.
   3.16.1. Except for Follow-Me vehicles, under no circumstances will vehicles remain in front
   of, or drive into, the path of a taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will not pass between an aircraft and
   its ―Follow-Me‖ vehicle. Unauthorized vehicles will not pass under any part of an aircraft.
   3.16.2. All vehicle drivers, who are operating on taxiways or parking ramps/aprons, will
   give way to taxiing aircraft. Only as a last resort will vehicles drive off the paved surface to
   ensure adequate clearance for aircraft.
   3.16.3. When an aircraft is taxiing in the opposite direction, the vehicle operator will move
   to a distance of at least 25 feet from the wing tip of the aircraft. The vehicle operator is
   responsible for ensuring there is sufficient clearance between the vehicle and taxiing aircraft
   at all times and avoid jet blast hazards.
   3.16.4. If an aircraft is approaching a vehicle, position the vehicle in a location that is well
   clear of the aircraft's intended taxi route. During periods of darkness turn headlights
   off/parking lights on until the aircraft has passed. This will ensure that aircrew members will
   not be blinded or have their night vision impaired by vehicle headlights.
   3.16.5. Procedures for Operating Vehicles with Daytime Running Lights. Operators of
   vehicles that are equipped with vehicle Daytime Running Lights (DRL) must exercise
   extreme caution while operating vehicles during the hours of darkness. Operators must never
   point headlights toward taxiing or towed aircraft.
3.17. Vehicle Parking and Chocking Requirements.
   3.17.1. Vehicles will not be backed into or parked in the immediate vicinity of an aircraft (25
   feet in front of an aircraft and 200 feet to rear of an aircraft) except as authorized (i.e.
   loading/unloading, servicing, towing). A spotter will be used when a vehicle is backing
   towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks and a guide will be used to prevent the
   vehicle from backing into the aircraft.
   3.17.2. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they do not interfere with aircraft being
   serviced or towed. Ignitions will be turned off, key will be left in the ignition, parking brake
   set, and the transmission placed in reverse (manual) or park (automatic).
   3.17.3. When aircraft engines are operating or being started, no vehicle will be parked or
   driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet behind except as prescribed by applicable
   Technical Orders.
   3.17.4. Vehicle operators will ensure painted roadways/driving lanes are not blocked.
   Vehicles will not be parked directly toward an aircraft. All traffic flow on aircraft parking
   ramp/aprons will be accomplished with the driver’s side toward the aircraft. Vehicle
   operators will not drive diagonally across ramp/aprons.
   3.17.5. All vehicles will approach a parked aircraft with the driver’s side of the vehicle
   towards the aircraft. Vehicles parked at the side of an aircraft will remain clear of the wing
   tips and be clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit. All vehicles operating within
   25 feet of an aircraft will not exceed 5 MPH (10 Km/h).
LAJESFIELDI13-213                                                                             23


   3.17.6. All motor vehicles will activate emergency flashers when parked on the airfield
   during the hours of darkness or inclement weather.
   3.17.7. Vehicles will not be driven over fuel pits located on the parking ramps/aprons; fuel
   pit height may damage equipment. Fuel pits can be identified as large mounds built into the
   pavement and painted yellow.
   3.17.8. Vehicle and equipment with studded tires are not permitted to operate on the airfield
   without prior coordination with the Airfield Manager, Wing Safety, Civil Engineer,
   Transportation, and installation commander approval. The Assistant Airfield Manager will
   keep a memo of approved units/vehicles and areas authorized to use studded tires.
   3.17.9. If you are part of a convoy or being escorted, the driver with the radio must request
   permission for the exact number of vehicles in that convoy. The escort is then responsible for
   those vehicles.
   3.17.10. If a vehicle becomes separated from its escort they should not try and catch up with
   the convoy. There may be a limited amount of time before an aircraft lands or departs.
   3.17.11. Vehicle escorts and convoys in the uncontrolled movement area will remain
   behind/outside the white line that delineates the beginning of the CMA. Tower approval is
   required before proceeding onto the CMA .
3.18. Aircraft Towing.
