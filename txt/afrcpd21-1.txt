SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision deletes reference to System Support Division (SSD) (paragraph 2.1) and updates the attach-
ment, Measuring and Displaying Compliance with Policy.



1. Purpose. Congress closely monitors flying hours and equates them with readiness and combat capa-
bility. Through the Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) process, Headquarters
United States Air Force Logistics Division (HQ USAF/IL) and Secretary of the Air Force Cost and Eco-
nomics Division (SAF/FM) maintain responsibility for development of cost per flying hour (CPFH) logis-
tics cost factors directly associated with the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) flying hour program. To
ensure maximum resources are available to support mission expectations, the Air Force Reserve (AFRES)
must establish and maintain an effective AFCAIG CPFH program. This directive establishes policy for
the AFRES AFCAIG CPFH program. This directive applies to all Air Force Reserve personnel involved
in managing, tracking, reporting, and analyzing the AFRES AFCAIG CPFH program. See attachment 1
for measures used to comply with the policy.

2. The Air Force Reserve:
   2.1. Programs and budgets for the AFRES AFCAIG CPFH resources needed to support its fiscal year
   Operations & Maintenance (O&M) flying hour program. AFRES AFCAIG CPFH resources include
   Depot Level Reparables (DLR), System Support Division(SSD) and General Support Division (GSD)
   flying consumable supplies, and aviation fuel (AVFUEL).
   2.2. Tracks AFRES AFCAIG CPFH execution, identifies potential program funding shortfalls, and
   analyzes reasons for CPFH variances.

    2.3. Increases management focus on weapon system resource management to include advance plan-
    ning for program requirements and cost accountability.
    2.4. Operates and maintains weapon systems in a cost-effective manner and identifies cost savings
    initiatives to reduce overall O&M costs.

3. Responsibilities:
    3.1. HQ AFRES/LG/FM provides total management oversight of the AFRES AFCAIG CPFH pro-
    gram.
    3.2. HQ AFRES/FM/LG jointly develops the AFRES recommended AFCAIG CPFH factors in
    response to the annual Air Staff tasking.
    3.3. HQ AFRES/LG establishes unit AFRES AFCAIG CPFH targets based on anticipated program
    requirements identified in the unit AFCAIG submittal and financial plan.
    3.4. HQ AFRES/LG provides HQ AFRES/FM the recommended AFRES AFCAIG CPFH program
    funding needed to support the O&M flying hour program.
    3.5. HQ AFRES/LG provides command resource management advocacy and tracks the total AFRES
    AFCAIG CPFH execution for each Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft.
    3.6. Numbered Air Forces (NAF) and AFRES units/base logistics activities review the actual CPFH
    execution and notify HQ AFRES/LG staff of significant program requirement changes affecting the
    AFRES AFCAIG CPFH execution rates and program funding.
       3.6.1. Units/bases establish and maintain visibility of the weapon system program requirements
       affecting their current and future AFRC AFCAIG CPFH.
       3.6.2. Units/bases track the weapon system operating costs to the level of detail needed to
       identify reasons for CPFH variances between their unit target CPFH and actual execution CPFH.

               MEASURING AND DISPLAYING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Compliance with the AFRC AFCAIG CPFH program will be measured by analyzing the AFCAIG
approved CPFH rates against the execution CPFH rates for each MDS.
   A1.1.1. CPFH includes both fixed and variable elements of expense. Variable elements are costs that
   vary directly with changes in flying hours. The CPFH is calculated based on the dollars associated
   with those elements divided by the associated flying hours. A comparison of the actual CPFH against
   the approved CPFH measures how well AFRC is controlling the costs to fly the approved program.
   Measuring on a per hour basis provides a consistent metric that prevents distortions due to under-fly
   or over-fly situations.
   A1.1.2. See sample of AFRC AFCAIG CPFH Metric (figure A1.1). Data Sources: The AFCAIG
   approved factors that reside in ABIDES and are published in AFI 65-503. Historical/actual execution
   will be extracted from the financial system BQ data.

   A1.1.3. Desired trend is to have CPFH rate execution equal to or less than the approved AFCAIG rate
   at the end of the fiscal year. Progress should be reviewed monthly for significant deviations; however,
4                                                                          AFRCPD21-1 1 May 2000

    no goal should be set. Achievement of the desired trend implies that the approved AFCAIG rate was
    an accurate estimate of the requirements.
    A1.1.4. Key Assumptions. There are two main assumptions that underlie this metric: (1) The
    approved budgeted CPFH is an accurate estimate of the requirements and (2) the actual aircraft utili-
    zation, missions flown, and maintenance concepts are similar to what was forecasted. Any deviations
    to the programmed assumptions during the execution year can affect the accuracy of the measure, for
    example, contingency operations.

A1.2. Compliance with the AFRC AFCAIG CPFH program will also be measured by analyzing the
effectiveness of AFRC in funding and executing the flying hour program. Both the total program with
reimbursements and the direct O&M only program will be measured. The total program metric is the Per-
cent Total Hours Flown divided by the Percent Total Dollars Spent and is expressed as a percent. The
direct O&M metric is the Percent Presidentâ€™s Budget (PB) Hours Flown divided by the Percent PB Dol-
lars Spent and is expressed as a percent.
    A1.2.1. See sample metrics (Figure A1.2 and Figure A1.3). Figure A1.2 Calculation Formula: 100
    X (Percent Total Hours Flown/Percent Total Dollars Spent). Figure A1.3 Calculation Formula: 100 X
    (Percent PB Hours Flown /Percent PB Dollars Spent). Data Source(s): Hours flown will be obtained
    from HQ DOTS monthly flying hour report. Hours programmed will be obtained from ABIDES.
    Dollars budgeted will be obtained from ABIDES. Dollars spent will be obtained for the financial sys-
    tem BQ data.

    A1.2.2. The annual target is 100% at the end of the fiscal year. Progress should be reviewed monthly
    for significant deviations; however, no goal should be set. Achievement of 100 percent at the end of
    the fiscal year implies the budgeted cost per flying hour was sufficient to cover actual costs and that
    the flying units received sufficient dollars to fly their hours. Values above 100 imply over-funding
    while values less than 100 imply under-funding. Significant deviations from 100 percent should be
    reviewed to determine the cause (under-funding; over-funding, improperly costed flying hours, etc.)
    and to determine corrective action required to fix problems.
    A1.2.3. Key assumptions: Flying hours are programmed to requirements and funded as necessary,
    and the AF Cost Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) cost per flying hour is correct.
