receipt and/or process small package carrier deliveries (Note: Only the Joint Personnel Adjudication
System (JPAS) will be used to verify Security Clearance Eligibility, Investigation Status, and Access
Levels; therefore units must provide the 366 LRS an update immediately if an individual's Clearance
Eligibility and/or Access Level is downgraded or changed). Packages will be secured by constant
monitoring or classified storage (01T) until turned over to the customer. Supply personnel will open
each package as part of the receiving process. Upon identification of a classified item, inbound
receiving personnel will initiate and use the receiving checklist for classified material (AFI 24-203,
Attachment 7).

classified assets. 366 LRS/LGRM will be notified within 24 hours or next duty day when a vehicle
operator’s Clearance Eligibility and/or Access Level is downgraded or changed (loss of clearance,
change in name, etc.), as designated by the unit commander or proper authority (e.g., Security Forces
Squadron or Unit Security Manager).
5.1.20.1.1. (Added) Vehicle Operations Classified Receipt Listing Certification. The Vehicle
