SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Text was
modified in various sections to remove F-15 specific terminology; references to minor, major,
and emergency fuel systems maintenance were not technically accurate and have been removed;
definitions have been added for approved fuel systems facilities; document has been revised into
four sections: Approved fuel systems maintenance locations, General Maintenance Procedures,
External Fuel Tank Management, and Procedures for “Lost in Flight/Jettisoned” Tanks.

1. Approved Fuel Systems Maintenance Locations:
     1.1. General. Hangar 19 (Building 8681) and Hangar 20 (Building 17534) are designated as
     primary fuel systems repair facilities. Hangar 21 (Building 17508), Corrosion facility and
     Hangar 17, (Building 16670) Spot 1 are approved alternate repair facilities. In accordance
     with Technical Order (TO) 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel
     Cells, they will only be used when the primary repair facility is unavailable. Hangar 8
     (Building 14410) is an approved Temporary Repair facility. In accordance with TO 1-1-3, it
     will only be used as a last resort. Hardstands 28 and 38 are approved Outside Repair Areas
     and can be used without limitation. Hardstands 39, 40, 41, and 42 may also be used based on
     the recommendation of the Fuel Systems Section Chief and with approval from the 3
     MXG/CC, Bioenvonmental Engineering Flight, Fire Protection Services, and the Airfield
     Manager.
     1.2. Repair Facility/Area Definitions:
        1.2.1. Primary Repair Facility. A primary repair facility is one specifically built or
        modified for use as an aircraft fuel systems repair hangar. It is the recommended, or
        preferred, location to perform fuel tank/cell repair and should be used when available.
        Refuel/Defuel and fuel transfer are permitted in these facilities in accordance with TO 1-
        1-3.
        1.2.2. Alternate Repair Facility. An alternate repair facility is one specifically built or
        modified for use as a fuel systems repair facility. It’s the next recommended, or
        preferred, location to perform open fuel tank/cell repair. Refuel/Defuel and fuel transfer
        are permitted in these facilities in accordance with TO 1-1-3.
        1.2.3. Outside Repair Areas. Outside Repair Areas are typically aircraft parking spots
        on or near the flight line. When possible, these areas should be segregated from main
        flight line operations. Use of outside repair areas is highly dependent upon weather
        conditions and the complexity/duration of the maintenance task.
        1.2.4. Temporary Repair Facility. A temporary repair facility is one not specifically
        built or modified for use as an aircraft fuel systems repair hangar but has been approved
        and certified for use in accordance with TO 1-1-3. The use of a temporary facility is
        considered as a last resort.
     1.3. Placement of Aircraft for Open Fuel Tank Maintenance:
        1.3.1. All fighter aircraft, 3 WG or transient, will be towed to Hangar 19 (Building 8681)
        for open fuel tank maintenance. If Hangar 19 is unavailable, fighter aircraft will be
        towed to Hangar 17, Spot 1. This must be coordinated through 3 AMXS/90th Aircraft
        Maintenance Unit (AMU).
        1.3.2. All large frame aircraft, 3 WG or transient, will be towed to Hangar 20 (Building
        17534) This facility is capable of housing any mission design series (MDS) requiring
        maintenance, including C-5 aircraft.
            1.3.2.1. Although Hangar 21 (Building 17508) Corrosion Facility is an approved
            alternate facility, the use of outside repair areas may be necessary in the event the
            facility is not available.
3WGI21-110 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                     3


          1.3.2.2. In the event Hangar 20 and Hangar 21 are unavailable, the aircraft will be
          towed to an approved outside repair area. Hardstand 28 and 38 require no additional
          approval and are the preferred locations for outside maintenance.
2. General Maintenance Procedures:
   2.1. Responsibilities:
      2.1.1. Expediter/Tow Team Supervisor, prior to towing aircraft into a fuel systems
      maintenance facility will:

        3.2.3. Ensure external tanks brought to Hangar 19 for maintenance or stored in the
        vertical tank storage system (VTSS) are drained, secured, and standpipes/cannon plugs
        are capped. Ensure aft pivot ball, washer, and nut are attached to the tank.
        3.2.4. Load external tank discrepancies in integrated maintenance data system (IMDS),
        screen 149, for all off equipment repairs.

     annotated in forms and notify the owning organization of “jettisoned” or “lost in flight” tank
     serial numbers.
     4.3. Owning organization will initiate supply action to replace jettisoned tanks.
5. Information Collection. No information collections are required by this publication.
