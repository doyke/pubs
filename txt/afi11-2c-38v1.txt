1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
    1.6.1. Each training mission must be structured to achieve maximum training. Any by-product airlift
    opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training in any way and must com-
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                                 9


   ply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) instructions. Any use of flying training hours to
   accomplish other than direct training requirements must be approved by NGB/A3. It is essential that
   personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility resources as well as the perception of their
   misuse. EXCEPTION: The approval authority for off-station OCONUS training flights is 113 WG/
   CC. The approval authority for CONUS training flights is 201 AS/CC.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted, 201 AS/CC
   may allow initial qualification, upgrade or special qualification training on operational missions
   (except pilots, see below). Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness
   and the aircrew member receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401. NOTE: Unqualified pilots will not receive in-seat
   training while passengers are on board. Basic aircraft qualified pilots may receive MR training while
   passengers are on board. This includes operational missions when under the supervision of an instruc-
   tor.

1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.1. Aircrew mem-
bers entered in a training program leading to qualification (or requalification) should be dedicated to that
program on a full-time basis.
   1.7.1. Unit will notify (in writing) NGB/A3T before training time limits, Table 1.1., are exceeded.
       1.7.1.1. Ensure MFR or waiver request includes training difficulty, unit corrective action to
       resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date.
       1.7.1.2. SQ/CC may extend upgrade training time up to 60 days. Extensions exceeding 60 days
       require NGB/A3T approval.
   1.7.2. Training time starts with either (whichever occurs first):
       1.7.2.1. The first significant training event directly contributing to qualification and upgrade (e.g.,
       computer-based training (CBT) lesson, ground training, flight), or;
       1.7.2.2. 90 days after being attached or assigned to the unit after completion of the formal school.
   1.7.3. Training time ends with the successful completion of the last training requirement prior to eval-
   uation/certification.
   1.7.4. Training start delays beyond 90 days require NGB/A3T approval. Submit waivers IAW para
   1.5. of this instruction.

NOTE:
     1. May run concurrently with mission qualification training.

1.8. Requalification Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies requalification training limits and
requirements.

1.9. Training Folder Documentation. See Chapter 7 and Attachment 2.

1.10. Evaluator Usage. Use flight evaluators for any phase of training to capitalize on their expertise and
experience. Units may use flight evaluators as instructors for qualification and upgrade training. If an
evaluator is used as a primary instructor to train an individual or makes the recommendation for evalua-
tion, the same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation.

1.11. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
     1.11.1. All instructors should be MR (wing-level and below).
     1.11.2. When performing aircrew duties, the following personnel must be under the direct supervision
     of an instructor:
        1.11.2.1. All non-current aircrew members (see para 4.2.5.2. for exceptions).
        1.11.2.2. All aircrew members in initial, upgrade (to include special mission qualification train-
        ing) or requalification flying training. Upgrade students may fly without an instructor when per-
        forming duties not related to the upgrade, unless otherwise restricted in this paragraph.
        1.11.2.3. Any other personnel designated by the wing, operations group, or squadron command-
        ers.
     1.11.3. For unqualified, non-current, and FTL E (see para 4.3.1. for definition) aircrew members, an
     instructor will be at a set of controls (or primary duty station) during critical phases of flight.

1.12. Distribution. Units will establish hard copy distribution requirements of this AFI.
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                             11


1.13. Transfer of Aircrews. Before an aircrew member transfers from one unit to another, the gaining
unit will review, assess and assign the appropriate TL.

1.14. Aircrew Training—DNIF and Alert.
   1.14.1. Aircrew members whose status is “duty not involving flying (DNIF)” may log ground training
   events, including simulator training, if the member’s physical condition allows it. Consult the flight
   surgeon initiating AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
   and action if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations.
   1.14.2. Aircrew members performing alert duty (of any duration) may accomplish ground training
   that does not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment. Specify requirements and/
   or restrictions in MAJCOM supplement.

1.15. Information Management. HQ AMC Aircrew Training Division (A37T) manages a host of air-
crew information. The site address, https://private.amc.af.mil/A3/A37T/dot/dot.cfm, includes down-
load information for command-level training courses (e.g., TCAS). HQ ANG Operations Training
Division’s Mobility Air Forces Flying Training Branch (NGB/A3TM) hosts aircrew training information
at its website, https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AN-G6.

1.16. Failure to Progress. If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements, then conduct
a Progress Review Board (PRB). The PRB can recommend: continuation in training; or AFI 11-402, Avi-
ation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action; (e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board
(FEB) convened by the member’s wing commander). The ATS contractor will identify students who fail
to progress IAW the applicable ATS contract as outlined in Chapter 6.

1.17. Failure to Complete Training. If an aircrew member fails to complete a formal course, then the
formal school will send a recommendation to the individual’s unit. The recommendation will state
whether he or she should complete training in-unit, or return to the formal school to complete training, or
be referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment.

1.18. Mobility Pilot Designation (MPD) Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For standard-
ization, use the following:
   1.18.1. FP = “Qualified Pilot.” This designation (as a 2-digit code) will remain active during the
   MPD transition period for first pilots. (Note: FP will be phased out after the transition to MPD is com-
   plete).
   1.18.2. During the projected 3-year transition to replace copilot and aircraft commander training
   courses with MPD training, copilots will continue to upgrade to aircraft commander. MPD pilots
   should have a shorter time to upgrade to aircraft commander; training will be conducted locally.
       1.18.2.1. FPN – Qualified Pilot – Non-MR (MPD graduate in local MR training)
       1.18.2.2. FPQ – Qualified “MR” MPD pilot
       1.18.2.3. FPL – Qualified “MR” Direct left seat, cross-flow, OSA, or FAIP graduate
       1.18.2.4. FPR – Ready for AC certification (training complete)
       1.18.2.5. MP – Fully certified/qualified aircraft commander
12                                                                     AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


        1.18.2.6. MPN – Aircraft Commander – non-MR
     1.18.3. Application.
        1.18.3.1. MPD applies to pilots who have never been an aircraft commander only. Upon comple-
        tion of MPD pilot initial qualification (PIQ) training, newly assigned C-38-A pilots will be desig-
        nated as FP in ARMS. They will then progress through a series of standardized third character
        qualification codes (exact progression will depend upon prior experience and prerequisites).
        1.18.3.2. FP = Qualified Pilot (third letter designator distinguishes the status of a MPD pilot who
        completed formal training with evaluation (graduate).
        1.18.3.3. FPN = MPD pilot (graduate) currently in local MR training (NMR). See level of super-
        vision mission capabilities.
        1.18.3.4. FPQ = Qualified “MR” MPD pilot – can fly on any mission with an AC or IP.
        1.18.3.5. FPL = Qualified, direct left seat cross-flow pilot, OSA, FAIP graduate, before complet-
        ing MCT training.
        1.18.3.6. MP = Certified aircraft commander.
        1.18.3.7. MPN = Certified aircraft commander (non-MR)
NOTE: The third digit “N” (e.g., MPN) signifies the MP will be NMR for an extended period of time
(greater than a month). Do not use the third digit “N” for short duration (one month or less) NMR status,
such as those due to DNIF or currency deficiencies.

                              INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Description. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This chapter specifies min-
imum training requirements for initial qualification, requalification, conversion/difference qualification,
and senior officer courses. Initial qualification is accomplished by completion of C-38 (G100) contrac-
tor-developed formal simulator training course at Flight Safety Services Corporation.

2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites IAW AFI
11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction.
   2.2.1. Initial qualification. On completion of initial qualification training, aircrew members will be
   classified as basic aircraft qualified (BAQ). Aircrew members must then comply with mission quali-
   fication (Chapter 3) and continuation training (Chapter 4) requirements.
   2.2.2. In-unit training in lieu of formal school. When attendance at a formal school is not practical or
   quotas are not available, units will request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification training using for-
   mal school courseware. In-unit training should begin no later than 90 days after reporting or being
   attached to the 201 AS. NGB/A3T is the waiver authority.

2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial qualification

AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction.

2.5. Conversion/Difference Qualification Training Requirements.
14                                                                       AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


     2.5.1. Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the
     same MDS. However, when the differences between series are great enough, the training is consid-
     ered conversion training which requires completion of the formal school initial qualification course.
     If the new aircraft has the same mission as the current aircraft, there is no requirement for additional
     mission qualification training.
        2.5.1.1. Difference Training. Aircrew members will meet all initial qualification requirements in
        one aircraft prior to entering differences training in another model aircraft. Send recommendations
        through ANG channels to NGB/A3T when additional difference training requirements are identi-
        fied. Difference training will be documented using over-printed AF Form 4024, Training Accom-
        plishment Report, listing difference training requirements.
        2.5.1.2. Conversion Training. Conversion applies to units converting to another MDS. When
        possible, qualified personnel from other sources will provide the initial cadre. Depending on the
        MDS, it could be necessary for the 201 AS to form an initial cadre from squadron aircrew mem-
        bers for whom certain training qualification requirements may be waived. Converting units may
        request initial cadre waiver of primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time requirement. Additionally,
        include the most recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks’ section of the
        waiver. The following conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
            2.5.1.2.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight-examiner personnel to begin aircrew conver-
            sion using qualified personnel from other units if possible.
            2.5.1.2.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held
            (e.g., C-40 MP to C-38 EP) unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
            2.5.1.2.3. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and
            flight examiners by crew qualification.
     2.5.2. Prior Qualification. Prior-qualified aircrew members may be accelerated through the normal
     training program.

2.6. Multiple Qualifications. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one MDS aircraft for
aircrew members only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is economi-
cally justifiable. 201 AS/CC will designate which aircrew members will maintain qualification in more
than one aircraft only after approval by NGB/A3. When manning necessitates, 201 AS full-time pilots
may be qualified in more than one aircraft only after approval by NGB/A3. These pilots must be mission
qualified with at least 100 hours in command and have at least 1,250 hours of primary and secondary time
in military fixed wing aircraft. Aircrew members must be approved and re-certified for multiple qualifi-
cations annually by NGB/A3. Aircrew members maintaining dual qualification in different model aircraft
will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft for pilots (N/A for senior
officers; see para 2.7.).

2.7. Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 para 2.8.
identifies senior officer qualification requirements. These officers will be assigned FTL E for continua-
tion training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see para 4.3.1.5.., and
para 4.3.2.4.).
     2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior officers
     (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or qualification. 201 AS/

   DOT is responsible for determining training requirements based on the senior officer’s flying experi-
   ence and familiarity with the weapons system. NGB/A3T will approve the proposed training plan
   prior to execution.

2.8. Flight Surgeons. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 establishes flight surgeon initial qualification requirements.
Flight surgeons will complete a standardized online open book examination. Flight surgeons will accom-
plish ground egress training for each aircraft on which they fly. They must also be current in physiologi-
cal training and have a current flight physical. Flight surgeons will comply with Table 2.1. and Table 3.1.
(“FS” column) in this instruction. Flight surgeons are authorized multiple qualifications.

2.9. Reports. The ATS has a post-training feedback system that elicits information and comments from
students, supervisors, and examiners in order to continually improve, update, and refine the ATS. Com-
manders and supervisors will promote use of this feedback system to its fullest extent.

                                                Chapter 3

                 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for mission quali-
fication training. Except where specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission sequence or sequence
of items as necessary to use flying training hours effectively and accomplish the unit mission. Both pilots
must be qualified when passengers are on board according to AFI 11-401. Mission qualification training
may be accomplished with passengers on board the aircraft provided each aircrew member is current in all
basic mission capable (BMC) events listed in Table 4.1. In order to accomplish training on overseas mis-
sions, aircrew members must be current in all MR items listed in Table 4.1.

3.2. Mission Qualification Training Requirements. Complete all mission qualification requirements
IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Table 3.1.. All ground training requirements and flying training require-
ments must be accomplished prior to unit mission certification.
     3.2.1. MR (MR) requirements must be completed prior to being deemed MR. Local training or oper-
     ational missions may be flown before completing all MR items, provided the qualified aircrew mem-
     ber has a current flight physical, and has completed physiological, initial ground egress, marshaling
     (pilots only), and life support training.

3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All aircrew members will accomplish all events in Table 3.1.
(Exception: senior officers or staff officers maintaining BAQ). Ensure ground training requirements in
Table 2.1. have also been accomplished.

   2. Complete if not accomplished during initial qualification.
   3. G090 and G110 are requirements for flight surgeon initial qualification training.

3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. Basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) aircrew members pursuing MR status will accomplish Flight
   Training Level (FTL) D (see para 4.3.) continuation training requirements. Upon completion of mis-
   sion qualification training, the aircrew member’s training level (TL) will be immediately changed to
   FTL C and flying training requirements prorated from the date of mission qualification status.
   3.4.2. MR Certification. Pilots must complete at least one operational mission with an instructor prior
   to being certified as MR.
   3.4.3. Category II Aircrew Training. If not accomplished during initial qualification training and
   annotated on AF IMT 8, Cat II training and certification will be accomplished during Mission Quali-
   fication Training (MQT).

3.5. Theater Indoctrination (TI). Theater indoctrination (M060) will be conducted according to AFI
11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction. At a minimum, training should include a thorough review of the-
ater unique instrument requirements and procedures, use of non-DoD instrument approach procedures,
required instrumentation for specific approaches, theater weather conditions, local area procedures, and
host nation agreements. Unit commanders are responsible for the accomplishment of this training for all
assigned and attached aircrew members and will design a program to meet requirements unique to unit
operations. Completion of TI training does not require attainment of MR status.

3.6. Category II ILS Training. This section outlines the training program for C-38 pilots who are com-
mand-certified for category II ILS operations.
   3.6.1. Seat occupancy during category II ILS approach and landing training. A qualified category II
   ILS instructor or flight examiner pilot will occupy the appropriate seat, as applicable, during pilot cat-
   egory II ILS training.
   3.6.2. Training weather and runway requirements.
       3.6.2.1. Actual weather – no lower than a 200 foot ceiling and ½ mile visibility (runway visual
       range of 24) or 800 meters day and night.
       3.6.2.2. Crosswind component – 15 knots maximum.
       3.6.2.3. Runway length – at least computed landing distance (brakes and speed brakes) plus 2,000
       feet.
   3.6.3. Normally, the following ground and flight training requirements will be incorporated into the
   initial aircraft qualification course:
       3.6.3.1. Ground Training. The training program must provide pilots training in the following sub-
       jects:
           3.6.3.1.1. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II/III ILS and
           visual aids (e.g., approach lights, in-runway lights, transmissometers).
18                                                                       AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


            3.6.3.1.2. Using runway environment visual cues during category II weather conditions with
            respect to different glide slope angles, cockpit cutoff angles, and altitudes at which these visual
            cues are normally discernible.
            3.6.3.1.3. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II ILS airborne
            systems (e.g., flight director system; automatic approach coupler; system used to identify the
            decision height for category II approaches, instrumentation, and other systems and devices
            peculiar to the aircraft.
            3.6.3.1.4. Resolution of decision height or missed approach point or minimum descent alti-
            tude with component failures (ground or aircraft).
        3.6.3.2. Flight Training. Flight or simulator training will cover the following subjects:
            3.6.3.2.1. Resolution of decision height.
            3.6.3.2.2. Missed approach procedures.
            3.6.3.2.3. Runway visual range, uses, and limitations.
            3.6.3.2.4. Transition from instrument to visual flight cues.
            3.6.3.2.5. Effects of vertical and horizontal wind shear.
            3.6.3.2.6. Review of category II specifications.
            3.6.3.2.7. Practice at least one approach in each authorized equipment mode.

3.7. Category II ILS Training Certification. This applies to C-38 pilots in aircraft that are command-cer-
tified for category II ILS operations.
     3.7.1. Eligibility. Pilots should be administered initial category II ILS training and evaluation during
     their initial qualification training. If not accomplished at that time, category II ILS training will be
     accomplished during MQT.
     3.7.2. Scheduling. Two otherwise qualified pilots may receive category II ILS training and certifica-
     tion on the same flight while occupying seats together and supervised by an instructor or evaluator.
     When a single pilot is receiving training and certification, a qualified category II ILS pilot will occupy
     the opposite seat.

                                               Chapter 4

                                    CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training requirements
to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure aircrew members receive sufficient continuation
training to maintain individual proficiency.

4.2. Aircrew Status. Aircrew members are assigned to MR (MR), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), Basic
Aircraft Qualification (BAQ), or Non-MR (NMR) status.
   4.2.1. MR (MR). A MR aircrew member is defined as one who is current, qualified and, if required,
   certified in the squadron’s mission; that is, the aircrew members has completed mission qualification
   training (MQT) for the applicable crew position. All aircrew members, except senior officers, will be
   MR. An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in all events required for MR status
   reverts to BMC status. The aircrew member may not fly OCONUS until regaining currency in those
   events.
   4.2.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-MR aircrew member assigned to MAJCOM headquar-
   ters, NAF, TACC, AMWC, tanker airlift control element (TALCE), AMOG, formal schoolhouse, or
   direct reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification training and does not
   maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command or unit operational mission. The
   aircrew member may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and is able to attain
   full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days. BMC aircrew members may log instructor or
   evaluator time for the portion of the mission for which they are current and qualified. An aircrew
   member that has failed to maintain currency in events required for BMC status reverts to BAQ status.
   The aircrew member is not allowed to fly operational missions until regaining currency in those
   events.
   4.2.3. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). An aircrew member that has satisfactorily completed
   training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1. An
   aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in events required for BAQ status reverts to FLY
   status. The aircrew member must fly with an instructor on all sorties until regaining currency in those
   events. Pilots will fly without passengers onboard until regaining currency in those events.
   4.2.4. Loss of FLY Status. An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in events required
   for FLY status will not fly until the overdue events are accomplished.
   4.2.5. Non-MR (NMR). An individual who is non-current or unqualified in the aircraft, incomplete
   in required ground and/or flight continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission is a
   NMR crewmember. See paras 4.7. and 4.8.
       4.2.5.1. If an aircrew member is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training, OG/
       CC has two options:
          4.2.5.1.1. Waive the required training IAW para 4.8. The individual is then designated as an
          MR aircrew member. This should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity.
          4.2.5.1.2. Place the aircrew member in supervised status IAW para 4.2.5.2.
20                                                                     AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


        4.2.5.2. If the aircrew member is NMR for failure to maintain currency per para 4.8., place the
        aircrew member in supervised status for that event (and the aircrew member flies with an instruc-
        tor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished.

4.3. Training Levels (TL). SQ/CC or designated representative determines the TL prior to each semian-
nual period. Assign new aircrew members a TL during in-processing. Base TL on experience and profi-
ciency. Aircrew members may be assigned TL levels that are more restrictive, but never less restrictive,
than the requirements specified in this paragraph. TL definitions follow:
     4.3.1. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
        4.3.1.1. FTL A – Highly Experienced Crewmembers. This may include wing, operations group,
        and unit commanders, operations officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation positions, and any
        instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Unit commanders may assign highly experienced
        MR line aircrew members to this level. Individuals may or may not maintain MR status.
        4.3.1.2. FTL B – Experienced, MR aircrew members.
        4.3.1.3. FTL C – MR aircrew members. Inexperienced aircrew members should be designated
        FTL C.
        4.3.1.4. FTL D – BAQ aircrew members. Primarily designated for BAQ aircrew members who
        are pursuing MR status.
        4.3.1.5. FTL E – BAQ, Non-Instructor Staff (may include senior officers, MAJCOM, NAF, and
        TACC individuals who are not maintaining MR or instructor status). FTL E requirements are suf-
        ficient for BAQ and BMC status but are insufficient for MR status. Aircrew members assigned to
        FTL E will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
     4.3.2. Ground Training Levels (GTL).
        4.3.2.1. GTL 1 – Highly experienced aircrew members with 10 or more years of operational fly-
        ing in their rated specialty.
        4.3.2.2. GTL 2 – Experienced aircrew members with between 5 and 10 years of operational fly-
        ing.
        4.3.2.3. GTL 3 – Inexperienced aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
        4.3.2.4. GTL 4 – NMR senior officers and staff officers.

4.4. Training Requirements/Tables. Standardized ARMS training requirement identifiers and descrip-
tions are in Chapter 7. Unit-defined requirements are designated as “X” events (e.g., X020) and are
listed in applicable MAJCOM supplements.
     4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.
        4.4.1.1. In addition to events accomplished on training and operational missions, those flight
        events accomplished on a satisfactory initial qualification, mission qualification, specialized mis-
        sion qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited towards the individual’s currency
        requirements to establish subsequent due dates and semiannual flying event requirements.
        4.4.1.2. Aircrew members who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight eval-
        uation will not log continuation training requirements for those events graded unqualified (Q-3)
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                           21


      according to AFI 11-2SAM Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria (will be AFI              11-2C-38
      Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria), until requalified.
      4.4.1.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
      4.4.1.4. Instructor Training Requirements and Responsibilities. Instructors and examiners may
      credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating. EXCEPTION:
      Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or landings flown by another
      pilot.
   4.4.2. Simulator Credit for Training Events. Pilots may log continuation flying events accomplished
   in the simulator (FAA-certified Level C or better) unless otherwise specified by the respective event
   description in Chapter 7, MAJCOM supplement, or Table 4.2. Pilots may maintain or regain cur-
   rency events accomplished in the simulator.
      4.4.2.1. Simulator Refresher Course Requirements. All assigned and attached pilots will com-
      plete annual simulator training during the calendar year. Simulator training is provided by Flight
      Safety Services Corporation.
      4.4.2.2. NGB/A3T is the only agency authorized to submit course requirement changes to the
      contractor.
      4.4.2.3. The unit training office will be the central point of contact between all agencies and the
      contractor for scheduling simulator refresher training. 201 AS/DOT will forward simulator
      requirements for the next fiscal year (FY) to HQ NGB/A3T no later than 15 July annually.
      Requests must identify both the optimum (minimum) and maximum number of classes desired.
   4.4.3. Use the appropriate ARMS forms specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 to record all accom-
   plished training and to update the ARMS database. The HARM will provide event numbers to iden-
   tify each training requirement and establish local procedures to ensure timely data input to ARMS.
   4.4.4. Centralized aircrew training record. All training events will be recorded in the ARMS data-
   base.
      4.4.4.1. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry. Separate training events may
      be logged when the appropriate course material is intentionally covered in one training session.
      All one-time and PCS-in events will be entered into the ARMS database. These events need not
      be maintained on individual currency reports.

4.5. Ground Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Aircrew members (including flight surgeons) will comply with the requirements of Table 4.1.
   See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
      4.5.1.1. Failure to accomplish requirements in Table 4.1. leads to NMR status. See para 4.8. for
      regaining MR status.
      4.5.1.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.1. does not lead to NMR
      status but may restrict aircrew member from certain missions.
      4.5.1.3. MR requirements must be completed prior to participating in operational missions as a
      qualified aircrew member. Local training missions may be flown before completing all MR items,
      provided the member has a current flight physical, and has completed physiological, initial ground
22                                                                       AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


        egress, marshalling, and life support training. MR, BMC, and BAQ aircrew members will accom-
        plish and/or maintain the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) and
        the appropriate events in ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables.
     4.5.2. Attached aircrew members may accomplish ground training events at locations other than their
     units of attachment. The event must meet training standards and receive NGB/A3T approval. Mem-
     bers are responsible for reporting accomplished training to the unit HARM.
     4.5.3. Continuation Training. The following will be emphasized in continuation training courses:
        4.5.3.1. Crew resource management (CRM).
        4.5.3.2. Systems knowledge and operating procedures.
        4.5.3.3. Normal, emergency, and instrument flight procedures.
        4.5.3.4. Operational risk management (ORM).
        4.5.3.5. Mission-Oriented Simulator Training (MOST).
     4.5.4. Senior Officers who complete the Senior Officer Qualification Course (A004) and have a BAQ
     AF IMT 8 shall be assigned, at a minimum, FTL E continuation training requirements and GTL 4.
        4.5.4.1. If possible, schedule senior officers for the annual simulator refresher course (G250). If
        not, ensure that senior officers are afforded all of the training in the aircraft that would have been
        accomplished in the simulator. Provide this training on local sorties not on operational missions.
        Include approaches, transition, and all applicable CRM, emergency, and mission orientation brief-
        ings. Instructors will log annual CRM refresher (G230) and simulator refresher course (G250) for
        senior officers upon completion of local training sorties.

4.7. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines proration of training requirements for air-
crew members not available for flying duties or those changing TLs. Perform the following formula steps
to determine training requirements for a select training period:
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                          25


       Step 1 – Convert number of days available to number of months available (see Table 4.9.).
       Step 2 – Look up Event Volume required.
       Step 3 – Determine Prorated Event Volume required using the following formula:


                Number of Months Available
                x Event Volume
                ÷ 6 (Number of Months in the Semiannual training period)
                = Prorated Event Volume Required (round down to nearest whole number but
        not less than 1)

   4.7.1. When an aircrew member goes PCS to a unit flying the same aircraft model and has the same
   TL or lower, give credit for training accomplished at the previous assignment. Prorate training
   requirements based on the time available (time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number
   of days not available) during the training period. Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for
   CONUS and 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS. Subtract previous accomplishments from the pro-
   rated total to determine remaining requirements.

4.8. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 contains addi-
tional guidance. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to complete ground or semiannual flying continua-
tion training requirements. See Chapter 1 of this instruction for waivers.
   4.8.1. Flight Training. At the end of the semiannual training period, squadron commanders will
   review ARMS products for those aircrew members who failed to accomplish all required semiannual
   flying training events. Squadron commanders will either direct training necessary for the individual
   to regain MR status or consider a waiver. If the ARMS review shows enough flying events were
   recently accomplished to ensure MR proficiency, the squadron commander may waive the require-
   ments. The same flying training events will not be waived for two consecutive training periods. This
   waiver authority must be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure aircrew members receive the proper
   quantity of flying events to remain proficient and allow squadron commanders to determine MR sta-
   tus and additional training requirements when those training quotas are not met. EXCEPTION:
26                                                                    AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


     Events with a specific frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly) in the currency column of training tables
     will only be waived under extreme circumstances and only by NGB/A3T.
        4.8.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in super-
        vised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring that
        event. Aircrew members are non-current the day after event currency expires (e.g., an aircrew
        member who accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-current
        on 1 November). Regain currency IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
     4.8.2. Ground Training. Squadron commanders may waive ground continuation training. This
     waiver authority must be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the indi-
     vidual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e., waivers will not be based on a crewmem-
     ber’s availability). Squadron commanders will determine the allowable time period of the waiver.
     Training should be completed at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is allowed for unforeseen cir-
     cumstances and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment.

                                        UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for upgrade.

5.2. MR Upgrades. Flying time prerequisites required for aircraft commander (MP) upgrade are based
on an FP having gained knowledge and judgment required to effectively command unit missions.
Upgrade to MP requires demonstrated proficiency in mission planning, pre-departure, in-flight, and
post-flight procedures, special procedures and systems before certification. In-unit Upgrade is the pri-
mary method for MP qualification training.

5.3. Instructor Upgrade Program. Course is designed to teach selected aircrew members fundamentals
and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment, ability
to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.3.1. Prerequisites. See Table 5.1. and this section for instructor upgrade prerequisites.
       5.3.1.1. Instructor Preparatory Course (IPC). All instructor candidates must have attended an IPC
       at a formal Air Force school or at the unit level.
           5.3.1.1.1. IPC Guidance. Unit level IPC will be conducted according to a plan submitted to
           and approved by the appropriate operations group and NGB/A3T. Primary instructors will
           maintain course content and update when necessary. A record of course attendees will be
           maintained for at least 2 calendar years. An AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, will be
           issued to each graduate and signed by the primary instructor. Unit level IPC operating instruc-
           tions are permitted and encouraged.
           5.3.1.1.2. Unit level IPC. Each IPC program will have a primary instructor appointed by the
           applicable squadron commander to be responsible for course content, scheduling, records, and
           training of new IPC instructors. IPC staff may be of any size but should be limited to only
           enough to accomplish unit requirements.
   5.3.2. Ground Training.
       5.3.2.1. An instructor must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft systems and equipment, normal
       and emergency operating procedures, prohibited maneuvers, and aircraft performance under all
       conditions of flight. Instructor candidates will demonstrate knowledge by organizing and con-
       ducting ground briefings on a cross-section of subjects from applicable directives. Briefings may
       be conducted as part of the existing continuation training or flying safety program, but the briefing
       must be critiqued by a same crew position instructor for content, organization, and delivery.
       5.3.2.2. The instructor candidate will receive ground training on training documentation require-
       ments.
       5.3.2.3. Instructor candidates will satisfactorily complete a written examination prior to qualifica-
       tion or requalification. The examination will be prepared, administered and controlled by DOV.
       Record examination results on an AF IMT 8.
   5.3.3. Flying Training.
28                                                                     AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006


       5.3.3.1. IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis will be on right-seat pro-
       ficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, practical emergency situation set-up, and
       operating aircraft systems. A minimum of one touch and go landing should be accomplished in
       the left seat, emphasizing the differences in cockpit layout and aircrew duties that affect left seat
       instructing.
       5.3.3.2. An initial instructor flight evaluation is required and validated by certification board.
       Instructor candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct and perform
       selected maneuvers and items according to applicable directives.
       5.3.3.3. Instructor proficiency guidelines. In the first quarter, following upgrade, emphasis
       should be placed on flying the newly certified IP in the local pattern to reinforce upgrade training
       and to gain experience in the local flying environment.

5.4. Flight Evaluator Certification. Squadron commanders will identify instructors for flight examiner
certification. An instructor identified for certification as a flight evaluator must possess satisfactory
knowledge of AFI 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, AFI 11-2C-38 Vol-
ume 2, C-38 Evaluation Criteria, and applicable MAJCOM supplements. All flight examiners must be
fully qualified instructors.

NOTES:
  1. Pilots remaining in BAQ status are required an initial instrument/qualification flight evaluation
     and unit commander certification board. Pilots progressing onto MR status do not require a certi-
     fication board for initial instrument/qualification.
               2. Recommended by an instructor with the concurrence of the operations officer.
               3. Total/PAA time may be further restricted by OG/CC. See MAJCOM supplements.
               4. All flying-hour requirements must be attained prior to entry into an IP upgrade program. Simula-

                                AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. Normally, the ATS contractor provides academic and simulator training and the Air
Force conducts all flight training and evaluations.

6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. The ATS is civilian contractor-provided air-
crew training in concert with Air Force instruction. This chapter applies to all aircrew members attending
formal schools using ATS courseware or attending ATS initial, upgrade, or refresher training. Simulator
training contracts govern USAF-contractor relationships and obligations and may only be modified by the
contracting officer. Units will not levy additional requirements on contractors. Contact the ANG training
office with recommended changes to the aircrew training program.

6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. It is imperative that students com-
plete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will enroll on a full-time basis and be
relieved from duties not directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may continue
their normal duties as time permits.

6.4. Course Prerequisites. Each ATS course is designed and based on student prerequisites being met.
Prerequisites may include a minimum number of flying hours, squadron operations officer recommenda-
tion, and completion of applicable training guides. Consult the course summary document (CSD) to
determine student entry level for each course.

6.5. Lesson Objectives.
     6.5.1. Lesson Objective Development. All objectives must meet requirements of Instructional Sys-
     tems Development (ISD) process as defined in AFH 36-2235, Information for Designers of Instruc-
     tional Systems-ISD Executive Summary for Commanders and Managers.
     6.5.2. Lesson Objective Description. These are subject to changes in the contract.
     6.5.3. Lesson Objective Use. Instructors and examiners use lesson objectives as a reference docu-
     ment to establish training and evaluation standards. Submit recommended changes through MAJ-
     COM channels.
     6.5.4. Course Material. All student guides, training guides, line development guides, etc., will be pro-
     vided by the ATS contractor. Local procedures will be developed by unit training offices to ensure
     students bring the current version of the course material to the start of each class.

6.6. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training.
     6.6.1. CRM Development. CRM trains aircrew members to cope with potential problems in human
     behavior affecting crew performance. Documented studies of aircraft accidents and additional data
     suggests most human behavior problems observed among aircrews could be grouped into six catego-
     ries: situational awareness, crew coordination/flight integrity, communication, risk management/
     decision making, task management, and mission planning/debriefing.
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                              31


   6.6.2. CRM Program. Introduction to CRM is presented during initial qualification training and is
   imbedded in continuation/upgrade training.

6.7. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
   6.7.1. If a student’s training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the government rep-
   resentative (group training, operations officer, etc.). Following a joint ANG and ATS contractor
   review of the student’s record, ANG will determine whether to continue or terminate training.
   6.7.2. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training office for stu-
   dents who display substandard performance.
   6.7.3. Remediation Procedures. NGB/A3TM must receive prompt notification from the contractor of
   failed course completion. Remediation subsequent to a failed course may be the responsibility of the
   ATS contractor, ANG, or held jointly, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordi-
   nation is required to achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate ATS instruc-
   tor supervisor is encouraged.

6.8. Courseware Changes.
   6.8.1. Submit courseware changes through appropriate MAJCOM channels, with information copies
   to NGB/A3T.
   6.8.2. Master Task List (MTL) and Evaluation Standards Document (ESD).
       6.8.2.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD were developed (are required) to provide the basis
       for courseware development. The MTL/ESD will be approved by NGB/A3T and is the evaluation
       criteria for validating an aircrew member’s performance. Flight examiners and instructors who
       evaluate or train crewmembers will use the MTL/ESD to determine the ability of an individual to
       meet the performance levels required to be mission-qualified.
       6.8.2.2. MTL/ESD Use. Flight evaluators and instructors in the training and evaluation of crew-
       members will use the MTL/ESD. Distribution of the MTL/ESD is sufficient to ensure that each
       squadron has reference copies for each crew position. Recommended changes will be submitted
       through Air Force channels using an approved quality assurance change proposal (QACP) pro-
       cess. Changes to the MTL/ESD frequently result in changes to associated courseware.

6.9. Aircraft Flights for Contract Training Instructors.
   6.9.1. The ATS contractor provides opportunity for ANG instructors to observe trainee progress in
   ATDs. Likewise, ATS instructors may observe the trainee’s aircraft flights IAW the terms and condi-
   tions of the current government contract and only after NGB/A3 coordination and AF/A3O approval.
   If the contract does not specify a requirement for contract instructor flights to observe students, then
   flights are not authorized unless an exception to policy is approved by AF/CV. Exceptions to policy
   require NGB/A3 and AF/A3O coordination.
   6.9.2. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. The contractor shall identify, publish, and update (as
   appropriate) to NGB/A3T a list of designated aircrew training instructors to fly onboard C-38A air-
   craft. Each contracted flight operator will have a valid FAA class 2 physical to fly onboard ANG air-
   craft. Approval letter must be maintained by MAJCOM and unit training offices. See AFI 11-401 for
   more information.

6.10. Responsibilities.
     6.10.1. ATS Contractor.
        6.10.1.1. In the event that an aircrew member is not capable of achieving initial aircrew qualifica-
        tion, the contractor will coordinate with the unit training office to determine a course of action.
        6.10.1.2. Provide the units with the following training documentation:
            6.10.1.2.1. Course completion diploma.
            6.10.1.2.2. Applicable ATD grade slips.
            6.10.1.2.3. Objective completion statements of computer-based courseware (if applicable).
            6.10.1.2.4. Document any training, to include reasons, that was not accomplished.
        6.10.1.3. Ensure the simulator, CBT, along with other devices and training aids, enhance flight
        training programs. The instructor will conduct scheduled lessons and mission overviews prior to
        each ATD lesson. All necessary data to complete the ATD mission or assigned task will be pro-
        vided during the pre-mission period.
        6.10.1.4. Maintain an ANG-approved aircraft systems refresher (academics) program to supple-
        ment the simulator refresher training course. Ensure instructors:
            6.10.1.4.1. Provide an environment for the simulator training that is as realistic as possible.
            Attention will be directed to crew coordination throughout all phases of flight. Aircrews will
            utilize equipment in the trainer the same as they would in the aircraft.

            is to provide meaningful feedback to the appropriate levels of supervision (ANG and contrac-
            tor) on the student’s refresher training. In cases where the student requires more training than
            the time available, exhibits less than required preparation, or displays an attitude problem, the
            instructor must provide immediate documentation or feedback to the student’s unit through
            appropriate channels.
            6.10.1.4.4. Provide all students with a refresher training critique, which will be completed and
            processed according to guidance in Chapter 1 of this volume.
     6.10.2. NGB/A3T.
        6.10.2.1. Provide overall management authority for C-38A contract training.
        6.10.2.2. Ensure that contractor-provided academic and ATD training complies with the policies,
        guidelines, and directives established by HQ USAF, HQ AMC, HQ ANG, and the current ATS
        contract.
        6.10.2.3. Review all recommended initiatives directed toward the C-38A training contracts. This
        includes recommendations for changes submitted by the contractor or other ANG agencies.
        6.10.2.4. Coordinate ANG training requirements with the contractor to ensure effective utilization
        of all contractor-provided academic and ATD training.
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                          33

     corrected through coordination with the training contractor when required.
     6.10.2.6. Review all initial qualification and refresher training courses and mission scenarios.
     Changes should be made as necessary when aircraft systems, operating procedures, or mission and
     command training requirements are modified or changed.
     6.10.2.7. Submit annual student training requirements to the contractor as required by the con-
     tract.
  6.10.3. Squadron Training Office (DOT) will:
     6.10.3.1. Evaluate contractor instruction through the review of aircrew member critiques, evalua-
     tor feedback, schoolhouse feedback, and their own evaluations. Inform NGB/A3T if standards are
     compromised with recommendations for action/resolution by NGB/A3T.
     6.10.3.2. Review simulator refresher training courseware and provide recommendations to
     improve the program.
     6.10.3.3. No later than 45 days prior to the class start date units must inform contractor of class
     number, name, and SSN of personnel attending refresher simulator training.
     6.10.3.4. No later than 30 days prior to class start date all units must notify NGB/A3T and con-
     tractor of all allocations they do not plan to use.
     6.10.3.5. Units desiring to use returned quotas will notify NGB/A3T. In the event that more than
     one unit desires to utilize the quota, final determination will be made by NGB/A3T.
     6.10.3.6. Units desiring to trade quotas may do so without ANG approval; however, they must
     inform NGB/A3T before the trade occurs for accountability and billing purposes.
     6.10.3.7. Requests for additional training quotas will be submitted directly to NGB/A3T. NGB/
     A3T will take required action and inform applicable command of any new authorized classes.

                                                Attachment 2

                              AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training documentation.
Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF IMT 4023, Aircrew Train-
ing Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report, and AF IMT 4025,
Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew training guides (TG).
     A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022, for the ETCA formal training (either at formal
     school or in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit upgrade
     program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at formal school or
     in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.
        A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if corrective
        action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who evaluated
        the aircrew member’s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training deficiency on AF
        IMT 4023 or the training guide. Use the existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations that
        result in additional training.
        A2.1.1.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more
        than one training program in a short period of time may be combined into one AF Form 4022. For
        example, a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to AC may have his or her mission upgrade
        combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
     A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee’s gaining unit.
     Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and may enter appropriate com-
     ments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023.
     A2.1.3. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily accessi-
     ble to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
     A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF IMTs 4023 and 4024 or
     the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously accomplished or those, in
     which aircrew members require additional training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the
     current training period. Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and flight
     commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review. Monthly and quar-
     terly reviews will be annotated on AF IMT 4023 or in the training guide.
     A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, place the summary/closeout report (AF IMT 4025) in the indi-
     vidual’s flight evaluation folder (FEF) or in a permanent training folder, as specified in MAJCOM
     supplement. Squadrons will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents for 1 year, then return them to the air-
     crew member. Do not insert AF Form 4022, AF IMT 4023, or 4024 or training guides into FEFs.
     A2.1.6. If training guides are not used, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be used for ATS and for-
     mal school courses.
     A2.1.7. Units may overprint versions of AF Form 4022, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and/or 4025 IAW AFI
     33-360, Volume 2, Content Management Program-Information Management Tool. Unit overprints
     must be approved by appropriate MAJCOM (for AMC and AMC-gained AFRC and ANG units, HQ
     AMC/A37T is the approval authority).
AFI11-2C-38V1 20 APRIL 2006                                                                              63


   A2.1.8. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the unit should
   be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be considered all training con-
   ducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or artificial training device.

         Complete Theory about the subject and when used with a performance code, can
                         inspect, weigh, and design solutions related to the theory involved
                         with activities.

    A2.4.11. Required Proficiency Level (RPL). RPL for the specific event and task. Each event and
    task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level the crew member
    must achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a knowledge standard designated
    and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The standards for specific events are either
    listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and evaluation standards document (ESD) for each
    weapon system or identified in this instruction. For those weapons systems that do not have any RPL
    listing, all events will have an RPL of “3” for performance and “C” for knowledge (if knowledge stan-
    dards are used in addition to performance standards). EXCEPTION: One-time events required for
    familiarization and not listed in the MTL and ESD or this instruction will not have performance and
    knowledge standard assigned. Performance and knowledge standards are in Table A2.1.
