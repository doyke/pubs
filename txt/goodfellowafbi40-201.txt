1. Scope. This instruction establishes guidelines for protecting Air Force personnel from
occupational exposures to ionizing radiation. It provides specific procedures for the receipt and
shipment of RAM by Goodfellow Air Force Base (GAFB) units. It also outlines procedures
required by contractors prior to bringing RAM onto GAFB for the performance of specific
activities on a temporary basis. This instruction is required by Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) Standard 10 CFR 20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.
2. Program Requirements.
     2.1. Personnel Dosimetry Program.
        2.1.1. The GAFB Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO), normally the
        Bioenvironmental Engineer assigned to 17 MDOS/SGOJ, will conduct radiation
        dosimetry according to AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry.
        Personnel working in the following areas are monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation
        with Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs).
           2.1.1.1. MDG X-Ray (17 MDSS/SGSQ), building 1001, exchange frequency:
           quarterly.
           2.1.1.2. MDG Maintenance (17 MDSS/SGSM), building 1001, exchange frequency:
           quarterly.
        2.1.2. The IRSO will prepare RDL Listing 1523, Dosimetry Assignment Data, to enroll
        and dis-enroll personnel in the dosimeter program. The IRSO will also review, sign, and
        distribute RDL Listing 1499, Occupational Radiation Exposure Report when received
        from the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM).
        USAFSAM will annually prepare and distribute an AF Form 1527-1, Annual
        Occupational Exposure History to Ionizing Radiation. The AF Form 1527-1 is prepared
        annually for each individual who has been monitored for occupational exposure to
        ionizing radiation and is entered in the USAF Personnel Dosimetry Program. Each
        individual monitored on the TLD program will review the AF Form 1527-1, sign it, date
        it, and return the form to the IRSO for filing. The monitored individual will be provided
        a copy of the signed AF Form 1527-1 and a copy will be placed in the individual’s health
        record (if available).
        2.1.3. TLD Exchange Dates. TLDs will be exchanged the first working day in January,
        April, July, and October.
        2.1.4. Quality Assurance Requirements. The following personnel dosimeter action
        levels will be used by the IRSO as a guide in determining surveillance and control
        requirements.
           2.1.4.1. Overexposure Level. A personnel dosimeter result which exceeds the
           maximum permissible dose listed in Table 1.1 Every effort must be made to prevent
           exposures at or above this level.

NOTE: Results at or above this level will require a formal investigation and report to the USAF
Master Radiation Exposure Registry according to AFMAN 48-125.
           2.1.4.2. Abnormal Exposure Levels (AEL). Personal dosimeter results which, if
           continued on an annual basis, would exceed the levels in Table 1.1 above. A formal
           investigation is required by the IRSO to determine the cause of the exposure and must
           be made in accordance with AFMAN 48-125.
           2.1.4.3. Investigation Action Level (IAL). Personal dosimeter results above the IAL
           will trigger an investigation by the IRSO. The GAFB IAL set for TLD dosimeters is
           100 mrem per quarter. The IAL includes all on- and off-base, military and civilian
           exposures incurred while performing duties with an ionizing radiation exposure risk.
           Investigation results will be annotated on RDL Listing 1499 and reported to the 17
           MDG Aerospace Medicine Council (AMC). If an individual on the TLD program
           requires conversion to monthly monitoring (i.e., pregnancy), the requirements of
           section 2.1.4.4 will apply.
           2.1.4.4. Pregnant Female Action Level.
               2.1.4.4.1. The IRSO must notify USAFSAM/OEHHD at DSN 798-3499 of
               pregnant occupational radiation workers requiring monthly monitoring and
               priority reporting of results. AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Program, requires
               that the dose equivalent to an unborn child as a result of the mother’s occupational
               exposure be “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” (ALARA), not to exceed 5
               mSv (500 mrem) during the gestation period or 0.5 mSv (50 mrem) per month.
               Pregnant workers with occupational exposure must be placed on a monthly
               exchange program according to AFMAN 48-125, paragraph 2.13.6.
               2.1.4.4.2. The GAFB Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) office will investigate
               exposures to pregnant workers above 0.05 mSv (5 mrem) per month. Findings
               will be reported to the local Energy, Environmental, Safety and Occupational
               Health (EESOH) Council and AMC. Pregnant women will be encouraged to
4                                       GOODFELLOWAFBI40-201 22 NOVEMBER 2013


              advise their supervisors promptly that they are pregnant so that the total dose to
              the unborn child may be limited. They shall be offered reassignment, for the
              duration of pregnancy, from specific tasks that are likely to exceed 50 mrem
              during the gestation period.
       2.1.5. Supervisor involvement with the Personnel Dosimetry Program. The supervisor
       shall:
          2.1.5.1. Review dosimetry results (RDL Listing 1499) after it is sent to the section
          and maintain in the section “health and safety.” Supervisors are responsible for
          ensuring the enrollment of new personnel into the program. This is done by sending
          newly assigned personnel to Public Health (PH). PH will schedule appropriate
          medical requirements.
          2.1.5.2. Ensure TLDs are stored appropriately near, but not within, the radiation area.
          Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that TLDs are available for exchange on the
          day designated. TLDs that are lost, damaged, or suspected to be overexposed must be
          reported to the IRSO immediately.
          2.1.5.3. Be responsible for ensuring personnel who may have occupational exposure
          to ionizing radiation during TDY to GAFB are added to the TLD program for the
          duration of their assignment. Contact the BE office at 654-3126 for temporary TLDs.
          2.1.5.4. If personnel assigned to the GAFB TLD program receive TDY assignments,
          they must take their own TLD with them. Supervisors must notify the IRSO if the
          period conflicts with the normal exchange frequency (monthly/quarterly).
          2.1.5.5. Ascertain whether workers are being exposed to ionizing radiation from a
          job other than their primary Air Force job. Notify the IRSO of this within 30 days.
          Obtain the individual's exposure levels from their outside employer and provide these
          results to the IRSO each month to ensure worker exposures stay below the acceptable
          dosage prescribed in paragraph 2.1.4.1 of this section.
    2.2. Employee Training.
       2.2.1. Training Plan. There is no requirement for written unit, organization or
       installation Training Plans for radiation protection at GAFB. AFI 48-148, paragraph
       3.3.1 requires only personnel who have the potential to be occupationally exposed to 10
       percent of the annual dose limits (> 0.5 rem/yr) shall receive initial and annual training
       that is appropriate in breadth and depth to the radiation hazards present in the workplace.
       The GAFB personnel dosimetry program has shown that no work centers produce
       exposures at this level.
          2.2.1.1. Unit work centers with the potential for radiation exposure need to
          incorporate the hazard into their respective Job Safety Training Outline (JSTO) for
          employee awareness and training (see AFI 91-202, attachment 5). The specific
          equipment, personal protective equipment requirements, location of operating
          procedures, and potential exposure levels should be included.
       2.2.2. ALARA Training. AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, paragraph 3.3.1
       requires the IRSO to conduct ALARA training only to individuals who have the potential
       to be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation equivalent to 10 percent of the annual
GOODFELLOWAFBI40-201 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           5


     dose limit as part of their assigned duties (> 0.5 Rem/yr). The GAFB personnel
     doismetry program has shown that no work centers produce exposures at this level.
  2.3. Quality Assurance Programs. The IRSO will conduct an annual Radiation Protection
  Program review, document the findings, and report to the AMC and EESOH Councils each
  year. The review will include:
     2.3.1. All personnel dosimeter results for the previous year to identify adverse trends and
     ensure that appropriate actions have been taken on results which exceed action levels or
     standards.
     2.3.2. All radiation survey results for the previous year to ensure that all required surveys
     have been performed and documented properly, and those corrective actions, if
     necessary, have been accomplished.
     2.3.3. Local implementing directives (including base operating instructions) to ensure
     they are current.
     2.3.4. An update of the radiation source and radioactive material inventory.
     2.3.5. All USAF Radioactive Materials Licenses to ensure currency and compliance with
     requirements.
  2.4. Radiation Surveys. There are three types of surveys routinely conducted by the IRSO.
     2.4.1. Radiation Producing Equipment/Source Evaluation.
         2.4.1.1. BE personnel will consult the Air Force Institute for Occupational Health
         Report IOH-SD-BR-SR-2005-0004, Bioenvironmental Engineers Guide to Ionizing
         Radiation, for detailed information prior to conducting radiation surveys. Various
         inventory forms are included in this report to assist BE personnel in completing the
         assessment.
         2.4.1.2. This evaluation is normally conducted in conjunction with the routine
         industrial hygiene survey. Specific items of interest to be covered during the survey
         include:
            2.4.1.2.1. Review of dosimeter results, leak test results and storage areas, if
            applicable.
            2.4.1.2.2. Changes in operating procedures or equipment, or the physical layout
            of the shop.
            2.4.1.2.3. Placement of a radiation area warning sign and a Nuclear Regulatory
            Commission (NRC) Form 3, Notice to Employees.
            2.4.1.2.4. Adequacy of reference material and Technical Orders (TOs) as needed.
            2.4.1.2.5. Requirements for lead shielding and other engineering controls.
            2.4.1.2.6. Any other item required according to current health physics practices.
     2.4.2. Scatter Radiation Surveys. This survey shall be done when equipment or sources
     change. Consult the USAF AFIOH Report IOH-SD-BR-SR-2005-0004 for guidelines.

       2.4.3. Radioactive Materials/Electron Tubes Storage Area Surveys. All radioactive
       materials storage areas will be classified and inspected by the IRSO. Storage areas are
       designated as “Unrestricted” or “Restricted.” The following guidance will be used:
           2.4.3.1. Unrestricted Areas (Full Worker Access Permitted). The radiation intensity
           does not exceed 2 milli-roentgens per hour (2 mR/hr) at 1 meter from any one
           container (storage bin). All containers are posted with a radioactive material warning
           label. Also, a radioactive material warning sign must be posted in the storage area
           when in use. Survey frequency: annual when in use. GAFB has no temporary
           storage areas in use at this time. The Building 443 warehouse will be used for
           radioactive material storage if required. The IRSO will perform a survey on the
           radioactive material storage area prior to use.
           2.4.3.2. Restricted Areas (Secure Areas Which Prevent Entry of Unauthorized
           Personnel). Radioactive material or items exhibiting radiation intensities in excess of
           2 mR/hr at 1 foot from any single storage container must be stored in a restricted area.
           The radiation intensity at no point on the perimeter or restricted area will exceed
           2mR/hr. Survey frequency: quarterly. Surveys will ensure all warning signs, notices
           and radioactive material permits are properly posted, facilities are secure against
           unauthorized entry, and measures are in place to keep personnel exposures ALARA.
           BE personnel will take surface swipe samples in common work areas to ensure no
           removable radioactive contamination is present. NOTE: There are no radioactive
           material Restricted Areas on GAFB at this time.
           2.4.3.3. For all radioactive materials storage area surveys, public dose assessments
           will be performed to ensure members of the general public are not exposed to
           ionizing radiation above standards.
    2.5. Shipping and Receiving Radioactive Materials. The 17th Logistics Readiness
    Squadron, Cargo Movement Element (17 LRS/LGRDDC) will:
       2.5.1. Notify BE at 654-3126 to ensure all radioactive shipments are monitored
       according to 49 CFR and AFI 40-201 requirements.
       2.5.2. Ensure radioactive shipments are labeled in accordance with applicable
       Department of Transportation guidelines (49 CFR). BE will provide advice and
       assistance.
       2.5.3. Prior to using unit radiation storage areas, notify the IRSO.                  RAM
       owners/generators will normally keep the items at their facilities prior to shipping.
    2.6. Procuring RAM. Individuals or organizations shall not:
       2.6.1. Procure or accept RAM onto GAFB without coordination and approval of the
       IRSO. Units will provide details of the radioactive material in question prior to
       purchase/shipment. Any item containing radium requires written approval from the
       USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC) through the BE office.
       2.6.2. Procure or accept a permitted radioactive source as defined in 10 CFR. Only the
       IRSO has authority to request or modify a RAM permit, which must be coordinated and
       approved by the RIC.
GOODFELLOWAFBI40-201 22 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           7


     2.6.3. Procure or accept radioluminescent signs or markers (e.g., emergency exit signs
     containing tritium) without written approval of the RIC through the BE office. If one or
     more suspected radioluminescent signs are found, the IRSO will investigate and confirm.
     If the sign is found to contain tritium, CE and BE will ensure appropriate warning labels
     are placed on the device. CE will notify the RIC and provide with an inventory of the
     signs, and a plan for their replacement and disposal.
  2.7. Radioactive Material Inventory. Listed below are shops and workplaces where
  equipment producing ionizing radiation or RAM-containing devices (including check
  sources) is known to be used, stored or maintained as of the date of this instruction.

Terms
As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) Concept— The management and administrative
actions to reduce personnel radiation dose to as low as possible, consistent with existing
technology, cost, and operations requirements. The ALARA concept assumes no level of
radiation exposure is totally risk free. While the established maximum permissible dose is
conservative and offers a low risk of adverse health effects, we should make every effort to
reduce exposures to the lowest level reasonably achievable and thereby lower the health risk
associated with exposure.
Broken Arrow— Accident involving a nuclear weapon, warhead, or component.
Formal Components— Personnel dosimeter program, training, written operating instructions
(OI), quality assurance (QA) programs, radiation surveys, low level radioactive waste, permit
procedures, and proposed facilities or operations reviews.
Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity— Indefinite-delivery contracts may be used to acquire
supplies and/or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are not
known at the time of contract award. An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite
quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period (Taken from Federal
Acquisition Regulation, parts16.501-2 and 16.504).
Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO)— The individual designated to manage radiation
protection programs. The IRSO provides consultation and advice on the hazards associated with
radiation and the effectiveness of control measures. According to AFI 40-201, the IRSO should
be the most technically qualified person available and should have specific education, training
and professional experience to assure a capability commensurate with the assignment. There are
two distinct categories of RSOs: permit RSOs and the IRSO. A person can be a permit RSO and
a base IRSO at the same time. The base IRSO is designated by the Wing Commander. If

applicable, this individual coordinates with and assists individual permit RSOs to ensure a
comprehensive, coordinated radiation protection program is carried out at the unit level.
Ionizing Radiation— Alpha Radiation, Beta Radiation, Gamma Rays, X-Rays, or Neutron
Radiation emitted spontaneously by radioactive materials or emitted intentionally by radiation
producing devices, which upon interaction with matter, will form ions.
Permit (USAF Radioactive Material Permit)— Written authorization from the USAF
Radioisotope Committee for Air Force organizations to receive, distribute, possess, use, transfer,
or dispose of radioactive material. These permits are equivalent to an Nuclear Regulatory
Commission License.
Radiation— As the term “radiation” appears through the remainder of this plan it is understood
to mean “ionizing radiation” or radiation in that part of the electromagnetic spectrum which is
capable of producing ions, directly or indirectly, by interaction with matter.
Roentgen Equivalent Man (rem)— The special unit of dose equivalent. The dose equivalent in
rems is equal to the absorbed dose in Radiation Absorbed Dose (rads) multiplied by the quality
factor (1 rem = 0.01 sievert, the Standards International unit); (1 rem = 1000 millirem).
USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC)— A committee set up according to the Air Force
Master Materials License to coordinate the administrative and regulatory aspects of licensing,
receiving, possessing, using, distributing, storing, transporting, transferring and disposing of all
radioactive materials in the Air Force except that transferred from the Department of Energy to
the Department of Defense in nuclear weapon systems, certain radioactive parts of weapons
systems and nuclear reactor systems, parts and fuel controlled under section 91b of the Atomic
Energy Act.
