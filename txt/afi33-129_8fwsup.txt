3.10.4.1. (Added) Base Content Manager. Ensure that all appointed unit content managers
receive training through the Microsoft SharePoint® training slides, individual training with the
Base Content Manager, or attend the base Microsoft SharePoint® training course that is available
every month.        (T-2). SharePoint® training slides provided by 8 CS/SCXK at:

3.10.5.1.1. (Added) Only members identified on submitted appointment letters will receive
“full control”, while all other unit members will receive either “contribute” or “read only”
permissions. Any changes in personnel will require a new appointment letter. (T-2) The
template appointment letter is located on the Base Content Management Microsoft SharePoint®
site                                                                                      at:

3.13.4. (Added) Oversees all appointed unit content managers to ensure the proper
management of Microsoft SharePoint®, Evaluation Management System (EMS), and the Air
Force Portal(T-2).

3.14.11. (Added) Assign permissions to groups, not individuals. Group permissions will only
receive “contribute” or “read only” permissions. Assigning individual permissions creates a
permissions environment that is difficult to manage. Site-wide permissions for groups can be
viewed, individual permissions cannot. Group permissions support a role-based permissions
environment which allows a departing individual to be replaced by a new individual easily – the
new individual inherits all of the correct permissions for the role. (T-2)
3.14.11.1. (Added) Group names should always begin with the site name. Site group names
will be limited to owners, members and visitors groups (i.e., 8CS_Members). (T-2)

control permissions. (T-2)
3.14.11.4. (Added) The membership group should be limited to unit personnel and be assigned
contribute permissions. (T-2)
3.14.11.5. (Added) The visitors group will be limited to personnel included in the “NT
AUTHORITY\authenticated users” group and will be assigned read only permissions. (T-2)
3.14.12. (Added) Document library restricted permissions. Libraries will have an (R) appended
to the end of the document library name to notate a document library with restricted permissions.
