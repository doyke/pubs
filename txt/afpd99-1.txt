SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This AFPD has been completely revised in content and format and must be completely reviewed.
1. Overview. This AFPD establishes overarching Air Force test and evaluation (T&E) policy to
ensure T&E is fully and effectively integrated throughout the Defense acquisition system. The
fundamental purpose of T&E is to provide knowledge to assist in managing the risks involved in
developing, producing, operating, and sustaining systems and capabilities. T&E expertise must
 2                                                                      AFPD99-1 3 JUNE 2014


be brought to bear at the beginning of the system life cycle to provide earliest awareness about
the strengths and weaknesses of the system under development. The goal is early identification
of technical, operational, and system attributes and deficiencies, so that appropriate and timely
corrective actions can be developed prior to production and fielding of the system, if required.
The ultimate goal is to ensure the weapon systems and support systems the Air Force acquires
and maintains meet operational capability requirements.
     1.1. Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM). ILCM is the acquisition and sustainment
     framework for all Air Force acquisition programs. It describes a seamless governance with
     transparent processes that integrate all aspects of infrastructure, resource management, and
     business systems necessary for successful development, testing, acquisition, fielding,
     sustainment, and disposal of systems, subsystems, end items, and services to satisfy validated
     warfighter capability needs. The T&E community is a key stakeholder in the ILCM
     framework and works in concert with leadership, developers, acquirers, integrators, users,
     and sustainers to ensure success.
     1.2. Categories of Testing. Air Force testing falls into two overarching categories,
     developmental testing (which includes live fire test and evaluation) and operational testing.
     Integrated testing is not a separate category, but a concept for test management. Integrated
     testing is the collaborative planning and collaborative execution of test phases and events to
     provide shared data in support of independent analysis, evaluation and reporting by all
     stakeholders.
2. Policy. Air Force T&E policy applies to any Air Force organization whose mission includes
T&E roles and responsibilities.
     2.1. T&E activities shall:
        2.1.1. Be conducted to reduce program risk by identifying and helping to resolve design
        deficiencies as early as possible and throughout the acquisition process.
        2.1.2. Be structured to provide essential information to decision makers and determine
        whether systems are operationally effective, suitable, survivable, and safe for intended
        use. T&E results will inform the decision process before proceeding beyond low-rate
        initial production and/or fielding.
        2.1.3. Support the modification, upgrade, and continued sustainment of fielded systems.
        2.1.4. Be objective, unbiased, and free from outside influences. Objectivity is
        significantly enhanced when test organizations, both developmental and operational,
        report through a separate chain of command than the developing organization.
        2.1.5. Use integrated testing concepts to the maximum extent practical.
        2.1.6. Provide T&E expertise and insight to acquisition professionals and requirements
        developers to help ensure user-provided operational requirements and concepts are clear
        and testable prior to program initiation.
        2.1.7. Use only verified, validated and accredited modeling and simulation tools when
        appropriate to assess performance, reduce risk, or mitigate resource limitations.
        However, dedicated operational test and evaluation (OT&E) will not be based exclusively
        on computer modeling, simulation, or an analysis of information contained in program
        documents.
AFPD99-1 3 JUNE 2014                                                                           3


       2.1.8. Incorporate appropriate intelligence information into T&E planning to accurately
       portray threat environments, capabilities, and vulnerabilities.
   2.2. The Air Force will operate, maintain, and improve T&E facilities, including the Major
   Range and Test Facility Base and USAF Test Pilot School, in support of Air Force, DoD, and
   other user requirements. The Air Force will continually evaluate test infrastructure
   requirements and capabilities to ensure critical test infrastructure is available when needed,
   and avoid unnecessary duplication of test resources IAW DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and
   Test Facility Base (MRTFB).
   2.3. The Air Force will support the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored
   Joint T&E (JT&E) Program through participation in all phases of the JT&E process IAW
   DoDI 5010.41, Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Program.
   2.4. The Air Force will maintain a Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) for
   continuous evaluation of fielded weapon system capabilities.
3. Roles and Responsibilities. All Air Force T&E organizations must plan and conduct
integrated T&E as an efficient continuum in collaboration with other program stakeholders. As
such, the following organizational responsibilities are established.
   3.1. The Director of Test and Evaluation (AF/TE) is the chief T&E advisor to Air Force
   senior leadership, responsible for developing T&E policy, establishing T&E guidance,
   advocating for test resources to support weapons system development, and resolving
   developmental and operational test programmatic issues. AF/TE is also designated the Air
   Force Foreign Materiel Program (FMP) Executive Agent. AF/TE:
       3.1.1. Provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the
       formulation, review, and execution of T&E plans, policies, programs, and budgets.
       3.1.2. Manages the Air Force test infrastructure to ensure adequate T&E facilities,
       resources, and expertise are available to support system life cycle T&E activities.

Terms
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)â€”Test and evaluation conducted to evaluate
design approaches, validate analytical models, quantify contract technical performance and
manufacturing quality, measure progress in system engineering design and development,
minimize design risks, predict integrated system operational performance (effectiveness and
suitability) in the intended environment, and identify system problems (or deficiencies) to allow
for early and timely resolution. DT&E includes contractor testing and is conducted over the life
of the system to support acquisition and sustainment efforts.
Integrated Testingâ€”The collaborative planning and collaborative execution of test phases and
events to provide shared data in support of independent analysis, evaluation and reporting by all
stakeholders, particularly the developmental (both contractor and government) and operational
test and evaluation communities.
Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E)â€”An OSD-sponsored T&E program conducted among more
than one military Service to provide T&E information on combat operations issues and concepts.
JT&E does not support system acquisition.
Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E)â€”The firing of actual weapons (or surrogates if actual
weapons are not available) at components, subsystems, sub-assemblies, and/or full-up, system-
level targets or systems to examine personnel casualties, system vulnerabilities, or system
AFPD99-1 3 JUNE 2014                                                                            7


lethality; and the evaluation of the results of such testing. LFT&E is a statutory requirement for
certain systems as described in 10 U.S.C. Â§2366.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)â€”1) The field test, under realistic combat
conditions, of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the
purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions
for use in combat by typical military users; and the evaluation of the results of such test. (10
U.S.C. Â§139(a)(2)) 2) Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational
environment as possible to estimate the prospective system's operational effectiveness,
suitability, and operational capabilities. Note: There are several varieties of OT&E depending
on the purpose of the testing.
Test and Evaluation (T&E)â€”The act of generating empirical data during the research,
development or sustainment of systems, and the creation of information through analysis that is
useful to technical personnel and decision makers for reducing design and acquisition risks. The
process by which systems are measured against requirements and specifications, and the results
analyzed so as to gauge progress and provide feedback.
Refer to AFI 99-103,â€”Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, for a complete list of T&E
terms and definitions.
