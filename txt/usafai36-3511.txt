 2                                                          USAFAI36-3511 10 MARCH 2009




1. Selecting and Appointing Officer Representatives (OR) and Faculty Representatives
(FR). An OR is the military representative of HQ United States Air Force Academy Director of
Athletics (HQ USAFA/AD) at all contests, home and away. Each intercollegiate team may have
as many ORs as the Director of Athletics and the team staff deem necessary. For the purposes of
this instruction, civilian FRs will have the same responsibilities as ORs. However, FRs will not
serve as military representatives and will not be assigned to those teams with a majority of
civilian coaches without the prior coordination of the Director of Athletics.
     1.1. HQ USAFA/AD will select ORs for each sport depending on team composition and
     requirements.
        1.1.1. ORs will be captains or above or the equivalent for civilian faculty members.
        1.1.2. The primary OR will preferably come from the HQ USAFA, Dean of the Faculty
        (HQ USAFA/DF).
        1.1.3. The secondary OR may come from any other cadet-related organization at the
        Academy.
        1.1.4. As role models, the ORs should be the same gender as the athletes; this is required
        if no member of the coaching staff is the same gender as the team members.
        1.1.5. Officers or faculty members interested in becoming an OR will submit a
        memorandum through their chain of command to the Directorate of Athletics’
        Intercollegiate Liaison Branch Chief (HQ USAFA/ADPL) and the head coach
        indicating a date of availability, supervisor's approval, qualifications, and interest
        level in the sport.
     1.2. ORs serve a 3-year appointment, which may end at the request of the coach, the OR, or
     the Deputy Director of Athletics (HQ USAFA/ADP) with the concurrence of HQ
     USAFA/AD. ORs serving more than 4 years can continue with the concurrence of HQ
     USAFA/AD, HQ USAFA/DF, HQ USAFA/ADP and the head coach. The position will be
     reviewed annually.
2. General Responsibilities:
     2.1. Wear an appropriate AF uniform when performing official duties.
     2.2. Promote academic, military, physical and moral well-being of a team.
     2.3. Assist the coach in every way possible in establishing high morale and esprit de corps
     with the team.
     2.4. Attend team practices when possible.
     2.5. Attend scheduled contests, home and away. Normally, one OR will travel on overnight
     or air trips. Civilian FRs will not travel to away trips when all the coaches who travel are
     civilian. A military representative should be present on all away trips; either a coach or OR
     may satisfy this requirement.
        2.5.1. Be familiar with and comply with the Directorate of Athletics’ Operating
        Instruction (OI) ADOI 65-103, Corporate Card Procedures/Rules for Use. This OI
USAFAI36-3511 10 MARCH 2009                                                                      3


       outlines the proper use of the corporate card and dictates what it can and cannot be used
       for.
       2.5.2. Be familiar with and comply with Directorate of Athletics’ Force Protection
       Plan/Antiterrorism Awareness Plan (FP/AT). The OR will normally act as the FP/AT
       monitor.
   2.6. Attend OR meetings to discuss expectations and responsibilities.
   2.7. Serve as the recorder (non-voting member) of the team's eligibility committee meetings
   IAW USAFAI 36-3518, Intercollegiate Athletic Programs, paragraph 4.2.
   2.8. The primary OR will develop a plan of action for academic improvement with the
   coach, cadet-athlete and academic advisor (e.g., managing course loads, assigned extra
   instruction [EI] and weekend academic call to quarters [WACQ], practice, competition or
   travel restrictions) for athletes on academic probation or for athletes whose academic
   deficiency does not warrant probation but needs attention. The plan should be established
   within 2 weeks of the team's eligibility committee meeting. The OR will ensure cadet-
   athletes are aware of eligibility committee decisions and that they adhere to the academic
   improvement plan.
   2.9. Closely track cadet-athlete compliance with any eligibility committee directed action or
   restriction. The format for this tracking is left to the discretion of the ORs. For academically
   deficient cadet-athletes participating with an Academy Board waiver, this data should be
   forwarded to HQ USAFA/AD twice each month during the cadet-athlete’s competitive
   season.
   2.10. Submit a memorandum to the appropriate academic advisors and Academic Review
   Committee (ARC) Chairperson on behalf of athletes meeting an ARC.
3. Trip Responsibilities:
   3.1. Ensure the team maintains proper discipline and conduct throughout the trip. Per
   AFWCMAN 36-3501, The Cadet Sight Picture, Cadets on athletic trips (i.e. on approved
   Scheduling Committee Action [SCA], orders or attending a sanctioned event) will not
   consume alcoholic beverages without Commandant (USAFA/CW) approval. Cadets wishing
   to consume alcohol on athletic trips must coordinate their request to do so through HQ
   USAFA/AD before seeking approval from USAFA/CW.
   3.2. Ensure team dress is IAW AFCWMAN 36-3501.
   3.3. Ensure cadets do not travel in their own cars to away trips unless prior approval is
   obtained from HQ USAFA/AD or HQ USAFA/ADP.
   3.4. Prior to departure, the FP/AT monitor will be made aware of and brief any specific
   threats that may be of concern to the traveling party.
   3.5. Primary ORs should coordinate with cadet- athletes and academic departments for
   any academic testing material to be given while traveling. Tests will be administered
   IAW Dean of Faculty policy.
   3.6. Report to the Directorate of Athletics’ Intercollegiate Logistics Office (HQ
   USAFA/ADSL), as appropriate, 1 day prior to trip departure to pick up the OR book
   with the necessary paperwork and trip instructions.
 4                                                           USAFAI36-3511 10 MARCH 2009


        3.6.1. ORs will maintain receipts for all expenditures associated with the trip. In the
        event of a lost receipt, use USAFA Form 116, Statement of Absence of Receipt.
        3.6.2. Tax Exempt Status. The Air Force Academy Athletic Association (AFAAA) and
        the USAF Academy Directorate of Athletics (HQ USAFA/AD) are federal organizations
        coming under the authority of the Superintendent of the USAF Academy and the United
        States Air Force. Both the AFAAA and HQ USAFA/AD constitute instrumentalities of
        the United States Government and are entitled to all the immunities and privileges
        thereof.
            3.6.2.1. In addition, the AFAAA has been identified and established as a tax- exempt
            organization through both federal and state agencies. The following tax exemption
            numbers apply: Federal-84-0616189, State of Colorado-98-02665.
     3.7. An order-issuing official may authorize or approve a special conveyance (commercial
     rental car) when advantageous to the Government. Personal preference or minor
     inconvenience shall not be the basis for authorizing or approving special conveyance use.
        3.7.1. It is mandatory within the Department of Defense (DoD) to obtain rental vehicles
        through Commercial Travel Offices (CTO), when available. When selecting
        commercially rented vehicles, the lowest cost rental service that meets the mission
        requirements must be selected. Using companies that participate in the program is
        encouraged because their government rate includes full liability and vehicle loss and
        damage insurance coverage for the traveler and the government.
        3.7.2. In addition to the vehicle charge, the following expenses are reimbursable: fuel
        and oil; parking; garage; tolls (bridge, road, and tunnel); liability insurance required by
        the company furnishing the special conveyance; and, traveler access fee (when charged).
        NOTE: It should be rare that the renter be required to pay “liability insurance” as that
        should be covered in the government rate and waived if traveling on government orders.
            3.7.2.1. In the case of an accident, the rental car agency should make their claim
            against the government per the CTO contract. As the renter, ensure an accident report
            is filed with the local police and the appropriate supervisor is notified.
        3.7.3. For more information as well as ceiling rates and rental agreements, reference the
        following websites: http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart1/dtr_part_i_106.pdf or
        http://www.sddc.army.mil/Public/Home.
     3.8. Athletic teams are official mission programs of the United States Air Force Academy.
     They are self-insured entities of the United States Government. Claims arising out of team
     activities may be filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.1346b, 2671-2680 and
     AFI 51-501, Tort Claims. This statement will serve as proof of insurance.
4. Post-Trip Responsibilities:
     4.1. Complete USAFA Form 115, Post Contest Media Report, and submit to the Directorate
     of Athletics’ Communication Office (HQ USAFA/ADEC) by 0745 on the first duty day
     following the event.
     4.2. File USAFA Form 114, Post Trip Expense Report, after every away contest with the
     Directorate of Athletics’ Resources Office (HQ USAFA/ADF) within 2-3 days of completing
USAFAI36-3511 10 MARCH 2009                                                                            5

   associated trip costs.
   4.3. Settle all financial paper work to include USAFA Form 114, receipts and copy of orders
   with HQ USAFA/ADF.
   4.4. Return all academic testing material to the appropriate academic department.
5. Medical Treatment:
   5.1. The team athletic trainer will act as the focal point for all medical related issues. The
   trainer should provide all medical care for an acute injury or illness. If care above what can
   be provided by the trainer is required, you should first use military medical treatment
   facilities. If that is not practical, the athlete should be referred to the nearest civilian facility.
   The cadet should identify himself or herself as an Active Duty member and provide: name,
   social security number, squadron and USAFA mailing address. Direct that all bills be mailed
   to Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators at PGBA, Attn: SHCP (Active Duty), P.O.
   Box 870019, Surfside Beach, SC 29587-8719.
       5.1.1. Routine medical care is not authorized outside of the local area. AFI41-101,
       Obtaining Alternative Medical and Dental Care, defines a medical emergency as medical
       care received in order to prevent loss of limb, eyesight, body fluids, or prevent undue
       suffering.
       5.1.2. If practical, the cadet or trainer should contact Tri-Care at 1-800-395-4929 before
       receiving medical care at a civilian facility. This is not required in the case of an
       emergency. The use of civilian care must be reported to the cadet clinic at (719) 333-
       5125 or DSN 333-5125. If the athlete is hospitalized, the Command Center must be
       notified at (719) 333-2910 or DSN 333-2910 as well as the Air Officer Commanding
       responsible for the injured cadet.
           5.1.2.1. For athletes seen at any medical facility away from USAFA, the Chief,
           Athletic Training Branch (HQ USAFA/ADSMT) or the Associate Athletic Director
           of Sports Medicine (HQ USAFA/ADSM) and the Director of Athletics’ Executive
           Officer (HQ USAFA/ADA) must be notified of the injury and the name of the athlete.
           5.1.2.2. If surgery or hospitalization is required, the attending physician should be
           asked to call the Team Physician or Medical Officer on Call at 1-800-379-1455
           extension 5005 or 5000, or (719) 333-5000/5005.
       5.1.3. During competition, the OR or an assistant coach should accompany the injured
       athlete to the medical facility. At other times, the athletic trainer should accompany the
       athlete.
6. Unusual Occurrences:
