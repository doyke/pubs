                                     INTRODUCTION

1. These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-
job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs
provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable
elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task
performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task
certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-
party certification.

2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the
trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS
Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all
4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange
training for each module in the order that you decide.

3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to
review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each
module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is
expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow
him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach).
Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient
time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without
assistance.

4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an
objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used
as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the
objective, document task completion appropriately in the six-part folder.

6. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task
Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B of the six-part training
folder. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s six-part training
folder. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the Master Training Plan (MTP)
six-part training folder.

7. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need
remediation. Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and
document appropriately in the 6-part folder. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that
the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective
is met.




                                             iv
8. If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task
certifier/certifying official, the trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to
perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task
certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted
with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After
third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in the 6-part
folder.

9. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training.
Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s
career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace
Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position.
The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials,
trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace
Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we
encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:

REMARKS/NOTES:                      Review steps of the process one-on-one with medical
                                    technician and/or nursing personnel skilled and verified in
                                    hemodynamic waveform recognition. (Note: waveforms
                                    should always be compared with EKG rhythm to
                                    calculate correct measurements)

OBJECTIVE:                          The trainee will successfully demonstrate the performance
                                    aspects of identifying without error pulmonary catheter
                                    waveforms, to include: Right Atrium (RA), Right Ventricle
                                    (RV), Pulmonary Artery (PA), and Pulmonary Artery
                                    Wedge (PAW)

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.   After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the
     task.

2.   The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
     performance could become detrimental to patient safety at any time.




                                              55
3.     Ensure waveforms are graphed with the EKG strip for the purpose of identifying the four
cardiac hemodynamic waveforms.

4.     Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5.     Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s OJT
       record. Initial evaluation should be documented in the 797. All recurring evaluations
       should be documented on AF Form 1098.

1. Identify characteristics of Right Atrial waveform:
   a. Normal pressures 0 to 8 mm Hg
    b. Waveform characterized by constant movement of the a and v waves in
       the baseline
    c. The a wave is found with in the PR interval of the EKG rhythm
    d. The c wave is found mid to end QRS of the EKG rhythm
    e. The v wave is found after the T wave in the EKG rhythm
    f.   Fig 1-1 Right Atrial Waveform




                                       Fig 1-1


2. Identify characteristics of Right Ventricle waveform:
   a. Normal pressures 15- 25 mm Hg systolic, 0-8 mm Hg diastolic
   b. Characterized by sharp upstroke rising to a peak pressure which is
       normally two to three times greater than the mean right atrial pressure.
    c. Systole is after the QRS complex but before the peak of the T wave
    d. The sharp down stroke which then levels off as the baseline directly
       measures RVEDP (Right Ventricle End Diastolic Pressure) Note the
       absence of the dicrotic notch
    e. Note: Ventricular arrhythmias such as premature ventricle contractions,
       ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation may occur during
       insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter

3. Identify characteristics of Pulmonary Artery (PA) waveform:
   a. Normal pressures 15 - 25 mm Hg systolic, 6 -12 mm Hg diastolic
   b. Rapid upstroke to systole
   c. Smooth progressive runoff to diastole
   d. Presence of a dicrotic notch (closure of pulmonic valve)
   e. Systole is found after the QRS and before peak of T wave
   f.   Diastole is found near the end of QRS

4. Identify characteristics of Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP)
   waveform:
   a. Normal values are 4 -12 mm Hg
   b. Characterized a dramatic change and flattening of the PA waveform
      tracing.
   c. PAWP is the most accurate reflection of left atrial pressure, and
      therefore of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), or
      preload.
   d. The a wave is found near the end of the QRS of the EKG rhythm
   e. The c wave is not usually seen
   f. The v wave is found after the T wave in the EKG rhythm
