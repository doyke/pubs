1. General.
   1.1. Technical Installations.
      1.1.1. Technical installation work requires extensive design, planning and (or) non-bench stock
      material. This work is scheduled and implemented in an orderly manner to ensure the best use of
      402 MXSG/MXRI resources. 402 MXSG/MXRI accepts requests for technical installation work
      only from an organization’s engineering branch, process support branch or group/staff office if the
      organization has no engineering branch. Submit all requests for project work orders in writing.
      1.1.2. Project work orders are defined as those requests requiring extensive repair and (or) modi-
      fication to existing equipment or facilities, or those requiring specialized tools, equipment and (or)
      personnel. Base Civil Engineering (BCE) is responsible for maintaining real property, roads and
      grounds, real property installed equipment (RPIE) and utilities. Real property facilities and equip-
      ment are defined as lands, buildings, structures, utility systems, improvements and appurtenances
      as accounted for in real property records. 402 MXSG/MXRI provides a focal point for requesting
      and monitoring BCE support of industrial real property facilities and equipment. If the project
      work order impacts real property or real property installed equipment, any resulting AF Form 332,
      Base Civil Engineering Work Request, must be reviewed by Environmental Management
      Directorate Resources Management Division (WR-ALC/EMX).
   1.2. Material Categories.
      1.2.1. Recurring/Common Usage Items. Frequently used, normally stock listed and (or) commer-
      cially readily available, maintained as bench stock with established stock levels, for example,
      plumbing, hardware and electrical supplies.
      1.2.2. Nonrecurring/Common Usage Items. Infrequent use, nonrecurring basis, has depot supply
      stock level or available commercially. 402 MXSG/MXRI does not maintain bench stock for these
      items, unless there is a need for them to be immediately available. Special levels will be estab-
      lished for those items in bench stock/insurance.
      1.2.3. Recurring/Peculiar Items. Used frequently, though not normally stock listed and may not be
      readily available commercially, for example, peculiar equipment or machine items which must be
      replaced often (due to high percentage of failure rate). If local vendors can supply these items
      within an acceptable lead time, 402 MXSG/MXRITS will not maintain a stock level. However, if
      items must be immediately available and lead time is not acceptable, 402 MXSG/MXRI will
      maintain items in bench stock as insurance items.
      1.2.4. Nonrecurring/Peculiar Items. Seldom used, normally stock listed and commercial availabil-
      ity is questionable. Requirements are generated on an unprogrammed basis and occurrences of
      failure are difficult to forecast. It is not economically feasible to stock these items.
      1.2.5. Insurance Items. Insurance items are either obsolete, hard to obtain, high dollar or long lead
      time items. Insurance items are used in support of equipment repair by 402 MXSG/MXRIP. Items
      will be identified by equipment specialist and (or) shop personnel (402 MXSG/MXRIP) and will
      be maintained within the material area, 402 MXSG/MXRITS. If shop personnel identify new
      insurance items, the equipment specialist should be notified to establish proper equipment identi-
      fication and procedures. Insurance items no longer required for use on equipment will be identi-
      fied to material personnel for appropriate disposal. Material personnel should check with the
      equipment specialist before any action is taken on insurance items with locations.

    1.3. Security.
       1.3.1. The Programs and Support Branch (402 MXSG/MXRIT) ensures materials are secure at all
       times.
       1.3.2. The Material Function (402 MXSG/MXRITS) only issues materials to individuals with a
       valid work order, identifying the project or work order number, noun, national stock number
       (NSN) and (or) part number, quantity and name of individual receiving materials.
       1.3.3. All entrances to material storage areas, building 321 and material storage yard are secured.
       1.3.4. Only authorized personnel are allowed free access (without escort) to the material storage
       area. Authorized personnel include all 402 MXSG/MXRI supervisors, Engineering and Construc-
       tion Branch (402 MXSG/MXRIE) engineers/technicians and 402 MXSG/MXRITS planners/
       equipment specialists/schedulers. All other personnel are escorted to gain entry into the area.

2. Procedures. This paragraph establishes procedures for all DMAG product groups when requesting
support from 402 MXSG/MXRI for technical installation projects, preventive and predictive maintenance
and repair of depot maintenance non-real property facilities and equipment.

       not completed, is included in the request.
       2.1.4. Ensure project work orders do not overlap or duplicate other project work orders.
       2.1.5. Ensure project work order requests are submitted in writing or electronically. Corrective
       maintenance work orders are either entered into the FEM web site, https://femweb.robins.af.mil/
       or called in to the work order control clerk, extension 6-8975.
       2.1.6. Attach drawings, sketches and required data for design, planning and work performance
       and forward electronically to 402 MXSG/MXRITS.

       2.1.8. Ensure WR-ALC/EMX reviews project work order requests prior to design start to deter-
       mine possible environmental impact and the need for completion of AF Form 813, Request for
       Environmental Impact Analysis. Any project that is reviewed by WR-ALC/EMX must have an
       AF Form 813 accompanying the project work order prior to start of design so environmental con-
       cerns are recognized.
    2.2. Preventive Maintenance Request Procedures.
ROBINSAFBI21-127 1 DECEMBER 2006                                                                        5

       21-127, it will be returned to the requester stating the reason for disapproval. If the request is for
       real property work, the requester will be instructed to send the request with an AF Form 813 to
       WR-ALC/EMX prior to forwarding the package to 78th Civil Engineer Squadron (78 CES).

4. Industrial Board Working Group (IBWG).
    4.1. The purpose of the IBWG is to review project work orders, identify and assign work determined

        retention or turn-in to 78 LGS or DRMS.
        9.6.5. If possible, returns “serviceable” material residue, not needed for future requirements, to 78
        LGS for credit.

            ensure shelf-life material is current, properly marked and stored correctly.
            9.7.1.3. Age-dated material must have the age control date, either the manufacture or expira-
            tion date, indicated on each container at all times.
            9.7.1.4. If indirect material items become over-aged or if the expiration date cannot be deter-
            mined, material will be removed from issuable stock. Item must be lab-tested or sent to

10. Maintenance/Service Contract Function. Budgets and justifies annual funding for material
requirements. Manages the DMAG Service Contract Program. Responsibilities include providing service
contract program guidance to DMAG organizations and preparation, processing and management of ser-
vice contract requirements for the plant management functional area according to AFI 63-124, Perfor-
mance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA). Requirements for increase in funds over and above the initial
annual budget will be justified in writing to 402 MXW. Ensures purchase requests are coordinated with
402 MXW Safety Office (402 MXW/SE) for a review of the Statement of Work anytime a contractor is
working on a piece of government property (whether on or off-base) and anytime a contractor is hired to
perform work on-base (including manpower support), so 402 MXW/SE can determine what safety
requirements will be appropriate.
