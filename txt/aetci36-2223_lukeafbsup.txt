This supplement establishes policies and procedures for updating and maintaining data within the
Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS) program by the appropriate
agencies. GTIMS is a commercial software product purchased and implemented by the
56th Operations Group (56 OG) as the system all 56 OG squadrons will use for automated
tracking and analysis of daily flying operations. In the event of conflicting guidance, the
AETCIs or AFIs take precedence over this supplement. This document replaces 56 OG OI
11-11. Submit an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication to the OPR to
recommend changes to this publication.Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rds_series.cfm.

SUMMARY OF REVISONS

This document is substantially revised from 56 OG OI 11-11 and must be completely

published in AETCI 36-2223.

3.5.1.1. (Added) (Luke AFB) The 56 OSS/OST will be the 56 OG designated GTIMS Manager
(GM) and will work with the GTIMS functional system administrator (FSA) to oversee all
coordination, implementation, and execution of the GTIMS program. The 56 OSS GTIMS
Administration staff will be the designated GTIMS FSA and will be the primary point of contact
(POC) for GTIMS administrative issues.

3.6.2.5. (Added) (Luke AFB) Monitors the GTIMS database roster of current aircrew member’s
names to include last name, first name, middle initial, duty position, rank, social security
number, and call sign. On a monthly basis, the UGA will review the GTIMS database to ensure
roster names and permissions are current.

function of GTIMS. This applies only to non-grade sheet syllabus events with confirmation of
completion.

3.6.3.1.4. (Added) (Luke AFB) Ensure Military Training Route (MTR) data in GTIMS no later
than 1500L the day prior to the actual flight. If flying on Saturday or Sunday, data must be
entered by 1500L on Friday. Units must input the route, start and end times, entry and exit
points, and call sign. After 1500L, low level (LL) routes must be approved by calling Range
Scheduling or Snakeye, ref. 3.6.3.1.4.1., and entered on the GTIMS schedule no later than (NLT)
two hours before actual entry into the LL route.

3.6.3.1.4.1. (Added) (Luke AFB) Units with changes or additions must contact Range
Scheduling or Snakeye. If local time is 1500-1600 the day prior, contact Range Scheduling. If
after 1600L the day prior, contact Snakeye at DSN: 896-8818.

3.6.3.3. (Added) (Luke AFB) Ensure that the 56 TRS/PFT has provided GTIMS GA or FSA with
assigned students and class data for upcoming classes. Scheduling privileges will be granted to
the gaining squadron one week prior to a class’s first fly date.

with the GTIMS GM or FSA, who will coordinate with the designated GTIMS syllabus
developer.

3.6.3.5. (Added) (Luke AFB) 56 OSS Current Operations will enter the SOF schedule into the
Duty Manager after weekly Range Wars, and assign appropriate squadrons with time slots.
