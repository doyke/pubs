   4.1. Once munitions requirements are identified, the OPR will coordinate through 512/436 EMS
   Munitions Management to ensure training munitions are available. The specific munitions persons
   authorized or designated to draw munitions, and the scheduled pickup date/time will be included in
   the exercise plan IAW paragraph 3.

5. Munitions Accounting and Control.
NOTE: Explosive training items, although normally containing comparatively small amounts of explo-
sive material, can be extremely hazardous if not properly handled and used. Stringent control and
accountability are essential to ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands or are used in an unauthorized
manner. Experience has shown those items inadvertently left on training exercise areas or taken to quar-
ters and used for pranks or experimentation can result in serious mishaps.
   5.1. Accurate recording of munitions issued and expended by individuals will be accomplished as fol-
   lows:
       5.1.1. OPR or designated representative will submit a “Pull Sheet” to the munitions storage area
       representative for requested munitions.
       5.1.2. Individual designated to draw the munitions will be trained in the use, handling, and trans-
       portation of explosives.
   5.2. Munitions Issue/Turn-in Log. The individual designated to draw the munitions will make a phys-
   ical inventory before departing the pickup point. The munitions custodian should use an AF Form
   3126, General Purpose Form to record issue of munitions to individuals prior to leaving for the exer-
   cise site.
       5.2.1. The quantity expended and turned in will be recorded at the termination of the exercise.
       Discrepancies in accountability will be resolved before departing the exercise area.
   5.3. Storage:
       5.3.1. Explosive devices solely used for the exercise should be picked up from the MSA just prior
       to use, and will not be stored in any facility utilized by personnel for the duration of the exercise.
       5.3.2. Weapons and Munitions/Explosives will not be stored together nor stored with any unre-
       lated items.
   5.4. If temporary storage of munitions/explosives is necessary, the following conditions and precau-
   tions will be adhered to:
       5.4.1. Wing Safety will be notified in order to obtain an AF IMT 2047 a temporary explosive
       facility license, for storage of munitions/explosives. The license is valid only for the duration of
       the exercise.
       5.4.2. A minimum separation of 25 feet is required between licensed location(s) containing GBS
       and/or SPM explosives and adjacent operations, personnel, or other licensed locations. Where 25
       feet cannot be obtained, a 2 hour fire wall, constructed in accordance AFMAN 91-201 is required.
       5.4.3. Hazard Class/Division (HC/D) 1.1 and 1.2 shall never be stored anywhere within the base

       5.4.4. The structure or room used for storage shall be locked to prevent pilferage and unautho-
       rized handling. If the storage building or room cannot be locked then an armed guard will be
       present to protect the explosive inventory.
       5.4.5. Fire and chemical symbols must be posted.
       5.4.6. AF Form 2047 is not required for storage of less then 1,000 rounds of HC/D 1.4 small arms
       ammunition (.50 Caliber or less).

6. Training for Ground Burst Simulators (GBS) and Smoke Producing Munitions (SPM).
    6.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring all personnel who handle, transport, or use simu-
    lators and/or smoke producing munitions are properly trained.

                      PRIOR TO EXERCISE - SAFETY BRIEFING (SAMPLE)
1. Hazards and precautions for the handling and use of the explosives involved. Ensure only blank
ammunition is issued to exercise participants. NO LIVE AMMO. Personnel issued live ammo for secu-
rity reasons will be identified and will not be exercise participants or permitted in the exercise area. Only
EOD trained personnel will function simulators or smoke producing munitions. Ensure simulators are
only functioned at safe distances from personnel and equipment. Only qualified personnel will be issued
weapons. Should you have any questions about your weapon or ammunition notify a supervisor immedi-
ately.
2. Range/exercise area safety criteria. Do not function simulators or smoke grenades in dry grass or com-
bustibles. Ensure at least two water fire extinguishers are present and serviceable.
3. Procedures for handling of dud or misfired munitions. Only EOD personnel are allowed access to mis-
fired or dud ammunition. Identify misfires or duds and keep non-essential personnel at least 300 feet
away.
4. Procedures to ensure the control and accountability of munitions. All issued ammunition must be
accounted for at the conclusion of exercise. Munitions can only be stored in a 512/436 AW Safety
approved licensed location.
5. Range/exercise area clean-up requirements and procedures. All expended munitions residue is
accountable and must be returned to 436/512 EMS Munitions Management. All munitions packaging and
containers must be returned to Munitions Management.
6. All fires starting in the vicinity of ammunitions or explosives will be reported and fought immediately
with all available means to prevent spreading of fire and munitions involvement. However, if the fire
engulfs explosive materials or is supplying heat to it, or if the fire is so large that it cannot be extinguished
with the equipment at hand, the personnel involved shall evacuate and seek safety.
