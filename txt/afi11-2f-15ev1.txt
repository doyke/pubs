                (LIMFACS) affecting training.
                1.2.5.13.1.2.2. A completed squadron training health slide (revised)
                summarizing critical training issues.
            1.2.5.13.1.3. Report guidance and templates can be found at ACC/A3TO’s COP,
            https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AC-OP-02-66.
        1.2.5.13.2. End-of-Cycle Reporting. Squadrons will submit an End-of-Cycle
        Training Report NLT the 15th of October.
            1.2.5.13.2.1. Report all deviations from the training requirements in this volume
            or the RTM, after proration at the end of the training cycle.
            1.2.5.13.2.2. Squadrons deployed at the end of the training cycle are still required
            to submit an End-of-Cycle Report within the requirements of paragraph
            1.2.5.12.2 Squadrons will report the number of training months and waived
            number of deployed months.
            1.2.5.13.2.3. End-of-cycle report guidance and templates can be found at A3TO’s

            66.
        1.2.5.13.3. Shortfall and LIMFAC reporting. Report only significant shortfalls or
        LIMFACS that affect 20% or greater of assigned/attached aicrew and all
        events/sorties waived by the OG/CC.
            1.2.5.13.3.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
            accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to
            accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training weapons.
            1.2.5.13.3.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade
            training effectiveness. EXAMPLE: the squadron's ability to accomplish actual
            weapons deliveries is limited due to the lack of ranges that allow heavyweight
            munitions.
            1.2.5.13.3.3. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required (if
            applicable). The MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize noted
 8                                                            AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


                shortfalls/LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
     1.2.6. Individual aircrew will:
        1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
        certifications and training requirements. Reference AFI 11-202V2 for guidance on
        individual aircrew responsibilities relating to transporting qualification records [i.e. Flight
        Evaluation Folders (FEF)].
        1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this volume.
        1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flight activities for which they are
        qualified/certified, current, and prepared.
1.3. Processing Changes. Process changes using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication, IAW AFI 33-360 and AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program
(FMP), through local and MAJCOM training channels to ACC/A3TO. ACC/A3TO will forward
coordinated recommended changes to USAF/A3O-AT for approval.
1.4. Training. Aircrew training is designed to progress a crewmember from Initial
Qualification Training (IQT) (Basic Course or Transition/Re-Qualification Training), then to
Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
     1.4.1. IQT provides aircrew the basic training necessary to initially qualify in flight duties
     without regard to any specific unit's mission. See Chapter 2. Upon completion of IQT,
     aircrew attain Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for all
     follow-on training, including MQT. Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ
     is not a long-term status. Waiver authority for any aircrew other than general officers above
     the wing level to remain BAQ for longer than six months is MAJCOM/A3.
     1.4.2. MQT provides aircrew the advanced training necessary to qualify in flight duties that
     directly support a unit’s mission. See Chapter 3. Aircrew maintain BAQ status until
     complete with MQT and subsequently designated CMR or BMC. The Formal Training Unit
     (FTU) Instructor course is equivalent to a unit MQT program.
     1.4.3. CT consists of two aspects. The first involves training in the basic flight skills
     necessary to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific
     mission-related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions.
     1.4.4. RAP is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to
     accomplish a unit's core tasked missions, fulfill DOC statement mission requirements, and/or
     provide focus on mission sets as determined by the SQ/CC. Specific RAP instructions are
     issued by each MAJCOM via a RTM (see Chapter 4). Upon completion of IQT and MQT,
     aircrew will have received training in all the basic missions of the unit (see Chapter 3 for
     exceptions). After MQT completion, aircrew will then be assigned to a CMR or BMC
     manning position within the unit.
        1.4.4.1. CMR. A status that denotes an aircrew is receiving the minimum training
        required to be certified, current, and proficient in all of the primary DOC statement
        mission requirements of their assigned or attached unit.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                  9


         1.4.4.1.1. All combat unit (CC-coded) active duty API-1 and API-2 positions, and
         flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may
         designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR
         [EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line
         of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s and -2s to CMR and designate the
         overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew, with at
         least 50%, if available, designated CMR].
         1.4.4.1.2. CMR aircrew maintain currencies that affect CMR status, accomplish all
         core designated flight training (missions and events), and all mission ground training.
         As described in the RTM, failure to complete required CMR training (both flying and
         ground) or maintain currencies could result in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR)
         status (see paragraph 4.7) unless waived by the approval authority for the event in
         question. While N-CMR, aircrew may perform missions (including exercises and
         contingencies) and events in which they are certified and current at the discretion of
         the SQ/CC.
     1.4.4.2. BMC. A status that denotes an aircrew is receiving the minimum training
     required to be familiar with all (and may be certified, current, and proficient in some) of
     the primary DOC statement mission requirements of their assigned or attached unit.
     1.4.4.2.1. All active duty wing aircrew positions that are not designated CMR positions,
     are BMC positions. BMC positions are assigned to aircrew that have a primary job
     performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flight operation,
     or are FTU/USAFWS instructors, or operational test (OT) aircrew. Many of these aircrew
     are required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of or in
     addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons.
         1.4.4.2.2. BMC aircrew must be able to attain proficiency and, if required,
         certification/qualification in 30 days or less for those missions/events that they
         maintain familiarization only.
         1.4.4.2.3. BMC aircrew accomplish all mission related ground training designated by
         their attached SQ/CC.
         1.4.4.2.4. BMC aircrew may deploy and may participate in any mission for which
         they are proficient and certified/qualified, without additional training, as determined
         by the SQ/CC.
         1.4.4.2.5. As described in the RTM, failure to complete required BMC training (both
         flying and ground) results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status (see
         paragraph 4.7). While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine missions the aircrew may
         perform and the supervision required.
  1.4.5. Specialized Training. Training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit's
  assigned mission that is not required by every aircrew. Specialized training consists of
  upgrade training such as flight lead upgrade (FLUG), instructor pilot/WSO upgrade (IPUG,
  IWUG), etc., as well as CT to maintain certification, currency, and proficiency in unit tasked
  special capabilities and missions.
 10                                                          AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


      1.4.5.1. Specialized training is normally accomplished after an aircrew is assigned
      CMR/BMC status and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements except for
      Mission Commander (MC) and Flight Lead (FL) training. Unless otherwise specified,
      aircrew in CMR or BMC positions may hold special mission certifications as long as any
      additional training requirements are accomplished.
      1.4.5.2. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew that will train for and maintain
      special mission certifications.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This volume provides
   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flight and operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training
   program support to HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to
   ACC TRSS. Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade Operational
   Test Aircrew in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the OG/CC
   and submitted to ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles,
   maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel brief/debrief). Tactical
   training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators, countermeasures, and
   dissimilar aircraft as much as practical.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
      necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
      introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor
      (IP, IW) is required.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and flight lead (FL)-qualified SQ supervisors may allow any pilot to lead
      limited portions of a mission if appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used to
      allow the pilot to practice events in which the pilot is already certified and current or to
      help determine if the pilot is ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP or SQ supervisor is
      responsible for the flight at all times.
      1.5.4.3. Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As the
      tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead
      retains overall authority and responsibility.
1.6. Experienced (EXP) Aircrew Requirements.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                 11


   1.6.1. An experienced aircrew has one of the following:
      1.6.1.1. 500 hours PAI.
      1.6.1.2. 1,000 hours (FP/IP/MP), of which 300 are PAI.
      1.6.1.3. 600 fighter hours, of which 200 hours are PAI.
      1.6.1.4. Previously fighter experienced and 100 hours PAI.
   1.6.2. For pilots, hours are FP/IP/MP and fighter time is defined as FP/IP/MP hours logged
   in aircraft while assigned an AFSC of 11FX or sister service equivalent (e.g. Navy F-18
   pilot). Hours logged during Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) (either as a student
   or an instructor) are considered fighter time.
   1.6.3. For WSOs, fighter time is hours logged in aircraft while assigned an AFSC of 12FX
   Hours logged during IFF are considered fighter time.
   1.6.4. Hours logged in the Mission Training Center (MTC) accomplishing RTM-approved
   missions will be counted as “hours” when determining experience level. RAP MTC Mission
   hours will not exceed 20% of the total PAI required to meet the experienced threshold (ex:
   100 RAP MTC Mission hours out of 500 hours PAI may be used to meet the experience
   threshold). See the current RTM for guidance on approved RAP SIM Missions and logging
   procedures.
1.7. RAP Policy and Management:
   1.7.1. The RAP training cycle is each fiscal year and executed IAW the RTM. Each RAP
   CT status (i.e. BMC/CMR) is defined by a total number of RAP missions, broken down into
   mission types, plus specific weapons qualifications and associated events as determined by
   the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
   1.7.2. The total number of RAP missions for BMC/CMR is the primary factor for
   maintaining an individual's CT status. The breakout of mission types is provided as a
   guideline to be followed as closely as possible but minor variances are authorized (excludes
   Red Air allocations). Variations in mission types may be used as a basis for regression as
   directed by the SQ/CC. Certification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering
   the MAJCOM guidance and the individual's capabilities.
   1.7.3. An effective RAP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or
   a building block type mission [e.g. BFM, Basic Surface Attack (BSA), etc.]. Each mission
   requires successfully completing a majority of the events applicable to that sortie type, as
   determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
      1.7.3.1. Only one mission will be logged per sortie (day or night) unless separated by Air
      Refueling (AAR).
      1.7.3.2. Each mission on either side of the AAR must stand alone as an effective training
      mission.
      1.7.3.3. A maximum of two missions per sortie will be logged under these rules.
   1.7.4. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR.
   1.7.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
 12                                                        AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


      1.7.5.1. A 1-month look back at the CMR mission rate.
      1.7.5.2. Certification/qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at
      CMR.
      1.7.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed aircrew can complete the prorated number of
      mission and event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
      1.7.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current Verification
      (see paragraph 3.2.3) or Certification (see paragraph 3.2.4) as applicable to the
      assigned unit’s DOC statement.
   1.7.6. Wing CMR and BMC aircrew will fly the required monthly mission rate. If unable,
   refer to Regression, paragraph 4.7
   1.7.7. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew's experience level (as
   defined in paragraph 1.6) on the last day of the current training cycle.
1.8. Training Mission Program Development:
   1.8.1. RTM BMC/CMR mission and event requirements apply to all BMC and CMR aircrew
   as well as those carrying special mission certifications (see Attachment 2). The standard
   mission requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per
   training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. The current RTM takes precedence over
   this volume and may contain updated requirements, missions or events not yet incorporated
   in Attachment 2. The RTM dictates what MTC missions/events may be logged as RAP
   missions/events and what currencies may be updated. The RTM will dictate what number of
   RAP MTC missions may be used for lookback. The RTM applies to all F-15E aircrew.
   1.8.2. BAQ requirements are different from BMC or CMR requirements (see the RTM).
   1.8.3. Experiencing and collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing
   unit flight hour programs.
      1.8.3.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired
      proficiency in optimum time. RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to help
      aircrew reach “experienced” status (see paragraph 1.6) to achieve overall unit
      experience levels.
      1.8.3.2. Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are
      necessary in day to day unit operations. These include but are not limited to functional
      check flights (FCF), ferry flights, deployments, and air shows. For the annual training
      cycle, the MAJCOM may allocate in the RTM a block of sorties for these purposes.
   1.8.4. Unit flying hour programs (FHP) are allocated a number of attrition sorties that
   compensate for non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a
   training sortie (Basic Skills or BMC/CMR mission) is planned and flown, but a majority of
   valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts,
   etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it is essential that non-
   effective sorties are logged and reported appropriately.
1.9. Training Records and Reports:
   1.9.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                    13


       1.9.1.1. AFI 11-202V1
       1.9.1.2. AFI 11-202V2
       1.9.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
   1.9.2. Track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable):
       1.9.2.1. Ground training.
       1.9.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, mission types, and
       events cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.9.2.3. RAP mission requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month
       running totals for lookback commensurate with CT status (BMC/CMR).
       1.9.2.4. Currencies.
       1.9.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment
       attempts and hit/miss percentages.
   1.9.3. Units may fill in ARMS with either the date of the last FTU or USAFWS equivalent
   training accomplished, or the date of SQ/CC certification of MQT completion.
1.10. Aircrew Training Assessment:
   1.10.1. Aircrew will use all available training media (e.g. ACMI, URITS, DVR, etc.) on all
   tactical missions to aid in assessment of training requirements.
1.11. Aircrew Utilization Policy:
   1.11.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group tactical aircrew (API-1/-2/-6s) fill authorized
   positions IAW UMDs and that aircrew status is properly designated. The overall objective is
   that aircrew perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrew to valid, short-
   term tasks (escort officer, flight evaluation board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but
   must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flight
   proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced aircrew in the first year of their
   initial operational assignment, supervisors should limit non-flight duties to those related to
   combat activities.
   1.11.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1/-2
   aircrew are weapons and tactics officer, scheduler, flight safety officer (FSO), supervisor of
   flying (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ
   Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), SQ Flight Equipment Officer (FEO),
   electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to flight operations (range control
   officer [RCO], etc.). In some instances, such as squadron-assigned FSOs, API-1/-2s may be
   attached to the wing. API-1/-2s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff
   positions unless total wing aircrew API-1/-2 manning is 100 percent or better. CCs will
   ensure wing staff aircrew (API-6s) perform duties justified in manpower standards
   documents and authorized in UMDs.
1.12. Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance:
   1.12.1. In general, inexperienced API-1/-2 aircrew should receive sortie allocation priority
   over experienced aircrew. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
 14                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


        1.12.1.1. FTU and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade, Instructor
        CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties.
        1.12.1.2. Operational Units. CMR API-1/-2, MQT API-1/-2, CMR API-6, MQT API-
        6, and BMC.
        1.12.1.3. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES). Requirements directed by
        MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects and tasking, BMC training
        requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
     1.12.2. For wings consisting of both FTU (TF-coded) and CC-coded units, at least one of the
     following aircrew will maintain FTU instructor status: wing commander (WG/CC), vice
     wing commander (WG/CV), OG/CC, deputy operations group commander (OG/CD).
     1.12.3. API-8 rated personnel flight authorizations, ACC/IGS inspectors in API-6 billets,
     and Test Unit aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.
        1.12.3.1. API-8 and ACC/IGS crewmembers should fly the BMC mission rate, but they
        are not required to complete BMC-specific missions/events or meet monthly lookback
        requirements.
        1.12.3.2. Test Unit crewmembers will fly the BMC mission rate as a minimum and
        should meet monthly BMC lookback.
        1.12.3.3. Units should provide assigned API-6/-8 flyers adequate resources to maintain
        minimum training requirements. However, API-6/-8 flyer support will not come at the
        expense of the flying squadron’s primary mission.
            1.12.3.3.1. API-6 flyers will accomplish Basic Skills requirements with allotted
            BMC sorties.
            1.12.3.3.2. API-8 and ACC/IGS flyers will strive to accomplish Basic Skills
            requirements with allotted BMC sorties.
        1.12.3.4. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request
        relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flight hour adjustments for
        attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW
        MAJCOM directives.
     1.12.4. There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR aircrew. Table 1.1 defines the
     maximum sortie requirements for other aircrew per training cycle. On occasion, unique
     operations may require aircrew to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized;
     however, this may impact training of other aircrew.

   Senior Officer Course (SOC) training that will normally be conducted during formal syllabus
   courses at FTU squadrons.
   2.1.2. Local Training. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available
   within a reasonable time period, local IQT may be performed at the unit IAW the provisions
   of this chapter. Local IQT will be conducted using appropriate formal USAF Transition or
   Requalification Training Course syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements (securing
   waivers for deviations are described below). When local IQT is authorized, the gaining
   MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training.
2.2. Approval and Waiver for Local IQT.
   2.2.1. Gaining MAJCOM/A3 is approval authority to conduct local IQT.               Info HQ
   ACC/A3T.

                                          Chapter 3

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is a unit-developed training program that upgrades IQT-complete aircrew
to BMC or CMR status so as to accomplish the unit DOC statement missions. Guidance in this
chapter, which represents the minimum, is provided to assist SQ/CCs in developing their MQT
program, which must be approved by the OG/CC prior to use. Squadrons are allowed to further
tailor their programs for individual aircrew, based on current qualifications (i.e. Instructor),
certifications (e.g. Flight lead, Flight Examiner, etc.), experience, currency, documented
performance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a
recertification program for aircrew that have regressed from CMR to BMC or requalification
program for regression to BAQ to specifically address deficiencies that caused regression.
   3.1.1. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days starting from the aircrew’s first duty
   day in the gaining unit. If the aircrew elects to take leave prior to being entered into MQT,
   the timing will begin after the termination of the leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC
   certification of BMC/CMR status (subsequent to the successful completion of the MQT MSN
   qualification checkride). Notify MAJCOM/A3T (through MAJCOM/A3TO) either if training
   exceed the 90-day time period or there is a delay beginning MQT (e.g. due to security
   clearance) that exceeds 30 days.
   3.1.2. AAR and initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) flight training will be
   completed NLT 90 days from completion of MQT. AAR accomplished in IQT may fulfill
   MQT requirements. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until
   training is complete.
   3.1.3. Aircrew in MQT will not fly in FLAG-level exercises or WSEP. The OG/CC will
   determine MQT participation in other exercises not specifically enumerated in the MQT
   syllabus.
   3.1.4. Night MQT will satisfy any unaccomplished night training requirement(s) from IQT.
   If night training was accomplished in IQT, the SQ/CC may certify aircrew to BMC/CMR
   status without night MQT. All night training requires previously demonstrated proficiency
   and currency in similar day events, unless accomplished with an instructor. Night MQT may
   be combined with the Night Vision Goggle (NVG) upgrade. If not completed during the
   normal MQT flow, night MQT will be accomplished NLT 90 days from completion of MQT.
   3.1.5. Prior to SQ/CC certification of an aircrew’s CMR status the following must be
   accomplished:
       3.1.5.1. LASDT CAT I training (see paragraph 3.4.4.3).
       3.1.5.2. Initial qualification in all weapons delivery or employment events required for
       CMR. SQ/CC may approve the use of weapons qualifications accomplished in the FTU.
3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this
   requirement.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                   19


   3.2.2. Aircrew transferring into a different MAJCOM require Theater Indoctrination (TI)
   academics IAW AFI 11-202V1 prior to the first flight in the new MAJCOM AOR. TI
   academics may be accomplished during MQT academics or as part of the MQT Local Area
   Orientation (LAO) brief/mission.
   3.2.3. Initial Verification. Initial Verification of CMR aircrew will be completed within 90
   days after completing MQT (recommended, but not required for BMC aircrew). Failure to
   comply will result in regression to N-CMR until complete. Suggested briefing guides are at
   Attachment 3 and 4. Each aircrew will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory
   knowledge of the squadron’s primary DOC statement missions. Board composition will be
   established by the SQ/CC (OG/CC for wings composed of more than one MDS where
   aircrew from the different MDSs are Verifying together to a mixed MDS board). Desired
   composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO (chairman), weapons, electronic combat, intelligence, and
   plans representatives.
   3.2.4. Initial Certification. Aircrew assigned to nuclear-tasked squadrons will Certify IAW
   AFI 10-419, Dual Capable Aircraft Nuclear Tasking, Planning and Operational Procedures:
   F-15E/F-16. Aircrew who certify are exempt from verification requirements. Units with
   DOC statement-identified “core” aircrew may elect either to Verify or Certify aircrew not
   identified as their core members.
      3.2.4.1. Aircrew assigned to nuclear-tasked squadrons in, or in support of, USAFE will
      certify IAW both AFI 10-419 and ACO Directive 75-6, Special Weapons Training for
      Strike Aircrew, and will apply the most restrictive guidelines of the two documents.
      3.2.4.2. Initial Certification for all tasked aircrew will be completed within 90 days after
      completing MQT. With OG/CC approval, aircrew unable to meet this requirement due to
      unit deployments will, at a minimum, complete an initial Verification IAW paragraph
      3.2.3 Applicable aircrew will then Certify IAW AFI 10-419 within 45 days of returning
      from the unit deployment.
   3.2.5. Experienced F-15E aircrew (IAW paragraph 1.6) who accomplished initial
   Verification or Certification at a previous F-15E assignment may, at SQ/CC discretion,
   complete either an initial or a continuation Verification to meet the requirements of this
   section.
   3.2.6. Notify MAJCOM/A3T (through MAJCOM/A3TO) if either the Verification or
   Certification (if applicable) will exceed the time periods specified.
3.3. Simulator Training:
   3.3.1. The recommended minimum MQT training profiles that should be accomplish in the
   MTC are listed in paragraph 3.3.3 Each training device mission will include selected
   emergency procedures (EP), unusual attitude, and inadvertent weather entry procedures.
   MTC MQT-1 is a prerequisite for the first MQT flight.
   3.3.2. If a MTC is unavailable:
      3.3.2.1. PC-ATD may be used for MTC MQT-2 or MQT-3; however, MQT aircrew
      must have a minimum of two MTC missions prior to MTC MQT-4 for practicing unusual
      attitude recovery and EPs.
      3.3.2.2. A CFT may be used to accomplish appropriate switchology and EP training.
 20                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


   3.3.3. MQT MTC Profiles:
       3.3.3.1. MTC MQT-1--Local Area Orientation/Instruments. Normal ground
       operations, standard departure(s), navigation, emergency airfield procedures and
       approaches, published penetration and approach to primary alternates and home base,
       emergency divert procedures, and EPs to include departure recognition and recovery
       procedures for both autoroll and spin recoveries.

       procedures, emergency divert procedures, hung ordnance procedures.
       3.3.3.4. MTC MQT-4--Mission EPE. This evaluation will be administered by a SEFE
       IAW AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2F-15EV2, MAJCOM supplements, and unit directives.
3.4. Flight Training. At SQ/CC discretion, applicable missions from those listed below will be
used to build the local MQT program. MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron
missions. Maximum use of armament recording assets and captive missiles is encouraged on all
MQT missions. Non-effective (NE) student non-progression (SNP) “X” sorties are limited to 2
per phase (A/A and A/G) and 4 total for the entire program. Further “X” sorties require SQ/CC
written approval in the training records.
   3.4.1. Supervision. A SQ supervisor (SQ/CC or SQ/DO) or instructor (IP/IW) in the
   element is required unless specified otherwise. The SQ/CC will determine the proper flight
   position of the supervisor/instructor unless specified otherwise.
   3.4.2. Breaks-in-Training. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, a “P”
   sortie will be flown before continuing in the program.
   3.4.3. Practice EPs. All aircrew must conduct practice EPs on at least one MQT sortie. As a
   minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flight, and debriefing a simulated EP scenario
   to include airborne communication with the SOF.
   3.4.4. Minimum Sortie Requirements. The minimum sorties required in a local MQT
   program include: LAO/Instruments, Air Combat Training (ACBT) certification, Low
   Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT), A/G Training, and a formal AF Form 8 MSN
   evaluation (not required if portions of the MQT program are used to recertify aircrew who
   have regressed from CMR to BMC). Reference the paragraphs below for further details and
   recommended sortie flows that the SQ/CC may use to develop the unit's MQT program.
       3.4.4.1. LAO/Instrument. As described in the local MQT flow, this requirement may
       be combined with ACBT certification (e.g. AHC, BFM, etc.). The LAO/Instrument sortie
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                              21


     flow will be a minimum of two sorties for inexperienced aircrew, one sortie for
     experienced (EXCEPTION: sortie(s) not required for aircrew assigned to the 4 FW right
     out of FTU). These sorties will emphasize basic airmanship skills (i.e. instruments,
     formation) while providing the aircrew familiarity with the local operating area through
     reinforment of TI academics.
        3.4.4.1.1. Mission Objectives: Be familiar with local area requirements and
        instrument procedures. Specific Mission Tasks: Local area familiarization, emergency
        airfield(s) overflight/approach(s), instrument penetration/approach (home field), FDL
        procedures and normal and simulated emergency patterns and landings. (IP in the
        aircraft for pilots, IP/SQ sup for WSOs).
        3.4.4.1.2. Individual events may be accomplished anytime during MQT, however all
        events will be accomplished prior to SQ/CC certification of BMC/CMR status.
        3.4.4.1.3. Aircrew will demonstrate proficiency in the following events: trail
        departure, lost wingman, instrument approach, precision and non-precision (at least
        one approach will be flown at the unit's primary divert base), radar trail arrival.
     3.4.4.2. ACBT Certification. A/A training programs will be based on unit tasking and
     conducted IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, and applicable
     instructions. The following sorties (in sequence) will be used to become ACBT certified.
     Units may expand this program to achieve desired proficiency or capability. ACBT
     programs for aircrew with previous fighter experience may be individually tailored based
     on experience, currency, and documented performance. FTU graduates meet the
     requirements of this paragraph with the exception of ACT.
        3.4.4.2.1. MQT-AHC. May be combined with the LAO/Instrument sortie(s) as
        described above. Mission Objective: Familiarize aircrew with aircraft maneuvering
        capabilities and limitations. Specific Mission Tasks: ”G” warm-up and exercise (G-
        ex), pitchback/sliceback maneuvers, nose-high/low-airspeed recoveries, low speed
        (below 100 KIAS) handling characteristics, high AOA maneuvering, high and low
        speed rate/radius turns, and acceleration demonstrations.
        3.4.4.2.2. MQT-BFM. Mission Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in BFM skills.
        Specific mission tasks: Tactical formation, ranging exercises, A/A weapons
        employment, offensive, defensive, and high aspect setups.
        3.4.4.2.3. MQT-ACM. Mission Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in element A/A
        maneuvering primarily in the visual arena.              Specific Mission Tasks:
        Offensive/defensive setups (to include defensive ACM perch), A/A weapons
        employment, engaged/defensive/supporting fighter roles and responsibilities.
        3.4.4.2.4. MQT-ACT. Mission Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in element A/A
        employment primarily in the BVR arena. Specific Mission Tasks: Tactical
        formation, A/A weapons employment, defensive threat reactions, reforms,
        disengagement/egress.
     3.4.4.3. LASDT:
        3.4.4.3.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, aircrew need to be
        knowledgeable of aircraft handling and performance characteristics, tactical
 22                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


           formation, intercept, offensive maneuvering, defensive threat reactions, and basic
           navigation. Operations in the low altitude environment require a well-supervised
           LASDT program, including initial certification and currency requirements. LASDT
           completion certifies aircrew to conduct low altitude training (LOWAT) at or below
           1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block/category certification is required prior to performing
           unsupervised operations in that block/category.
           3.4.4.3.2. The LASDT program is built on a multi-phase training process IAW Table
           3.1 There is no time limit to progress beyond Category I and progress will be based
           upon individual aircrew proficiency and training availability. Progression through the
           program is based on instructor/SQ supervisor (SQ/CC or DO) assessment of aircrew
           performance, TR compliance, and judgment. All LASDT sorties will be supervised
           by an instructor or FL-qualified SQ supervisor (SQ/CC or DO) who is certified and
           current in LASDT.

Table 3.1. LOWAT Categories.
Category           Altitude Block        Minimum Requirements To Certify
I                  1,000-500             LASDT-1, -2, -3
II                 500-300               LOWAT Cat I Certified; LASDT-4, -5, -6
III                300-100               LOWAT Cat II Certified; LASDT-7, -8, -9
           3.4.4.3.3. Demonstrated proficiency down to 500 feet AGL is required for Category I
           certification and is normally accomplished during IQT and/or MQT. At SQ/CC
           discretion, units may accept an aircrew's LOWAT category certifications from other
           units. LOWAT Category I certification is a minimum requirement for CMR status.
           3.4.4.3.4. Entry into LASDT requires SQ/CC approval. The altitude to which an
           aircrew is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at
           which all tasks can be comfortably and proficiently performed. The goal is
           proficiency down to the minimum altitude necessary to execute the the squadron
           primary DOC statement missions. Upon successful completion of LASDT training,
           the SQ/CC will certify the aircrew to the minimum approved altitude of the LASDT
           category in which the aircrew was trained. With SQ/CC approval, low altitude
           training conducted at FTU/USAFWS may be used to fulfill LASDT certification
           requirements.
           3.4.4.3.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the flight;
           however, other compatible events may be accomplished as long as the objectives of
           the LASDT training are met. LASDT training will not be accomplished as an
           alternate mission. Training profiles will be developed to avoid over-tasking the
           upgrading aircrew, and upgrade sortie continuity should be emphasized.

   3.5.2. ACDE MTC. A MTC mission in full ACDE (anti-exposure suit liner may be
   substituted), harness, and G-suit. Within the mission profile, practice doffing simulated
   contaminated equipment. An ACDE MTC mission may use existing MTC mission profiles
   and count toward MTC RAP training cycle requirements. If an MTC is not available,
   squadrons will use their best available simulator or actual aircraft cockpit. The initial ACDE
   MTC should be conducted as close as possible to the day before (but not more than 30 days
   prior) to the ACDE flight.
   3.5.3. ACDE Flight. The ACDE flight will be accomplished once in a career. Flight
   profiles must consider limitations of operating while wearing ACDE. Full donning and
   doffing procedures/sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but the
   only portion of the ACDE worn in-flight will be mask, filter pack, and gloves.
      3.5.3.1. ACDE Flight Restrictions:
      3.5.3.1.1. Aircrew will be fully certified and current in an event prior to accomplishing
      that event on an ACDE sortie.
          3.5.3.1.2. Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL, except patterns/approaches and
          landing.
          3.5.3.1.3. No ACBT or night sorties. AAR requires an IP/IWSO in the flight.
          3.5.3.1.4. Weather minimums are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (4.8 km) visibility.
          3.5.3.1.5. Formations are limited to a two-ship. Only one aircrew per aircraft and no
          more than one pilot in the element can wear the ACDE while flying. Pilots in ACDE

          gear need an experienced aircrew in the Rear Cockpit (RCP). Pilots wearing ACDE
          gear will not fly in dissimilar formations. Minimum formation spacing is route unless
          fingertip is required for safe mission accomplishment (i.e., WX penetration)
      3.5.3.2. Operations supervision should not allow the ACDE flight when, in their
      judgment, temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations.
3.6. Flight Surgeons (FS) and Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) Training:
   3.6.1. Ground Training. FSs and GLOs who have not previously flown the F-15E will
   accomplish the following before the initial flight brief: aircraft general review; hanging
   harness/egress training (as applicable), Aircrew Flight Equipement (AFE) training; Anti-G
   Straining Maneuver (AGSM) training, and an instrument/EP simulator (if available) with an
   instructor (1 hour minimum). FSs will also ensure completion of AFI 11-202V2 qualification
   requirements as verified by the squadron Stan/Eval function and recorded in ARMs.
   3.6.2. Flight Training. The first flight will be with an IP and may be flown in conjunction
   with other training sorties. The brief and sortie will emphasize crew coordination,
   communications and equipment, instrument interpretation, and the aircraft's performance
   envelope.

       BMC rate and accomplish the BMC Basic Skills requirements as shown and noted in the
       RTM. Formal training syllabus-directed missions and approved test plan missions apply
       to lookback for TF and CB coded units respectively. Any CMR/BMC RAP mission
       listed in the RTM also counts toward lookback requirements.
          4.1.4.1.1. As long as AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2 periodic instructor
          evaluation requirements are met, instructors failing to accomplish Basic Skills
          requirements will not lose instructor qualification, but will require additional training
          as determined by the SQ/CC prior to performing instructor duties in the delinquent
          event.
          4.1.4.1.2. Aircrew assigned or attached to CB-coded units and the 475 Weapons
          Evaluation Group (WEG) do not need to maintain instructor qualification.
       4.1.4.2. Ground Training. As directed by the unit or SQ/CC.
          4.1.4.2.1. MTC requirements do not apply to USAFAWC and USAFWTC aircrew,
          with the following exception: Each crewmember must accomplish one graded (IAW
          this AFI) or evaluated (IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2) EP simulator per
          year. This training must be accomplished in a fully functional MTC, Unit Training
          Device (UTD) or Full Mission Trainer (FMT). Part task training devices and cockpit
          mock-ups are not acceptable. Waivers to this requirement will require ACC/A3
          approval.
       4.1.4.3. Flight Training. Unit or SQ/CC will direct additional sorties if programmed
       syllabus or test missions do not provide sufficient aircrew proficiency training.
       4.1.4.4. Weapons Events. Aircrew qualified in A/G or Multi-Role aircraft will maintain
       appropriate weapons delivery currencies. Instructors must be initially qualified in the
       weapons events they plan to instruct.
       4.1.4.5. MSN and INSTR (INIT and RQ) Evaluations will be conducted as applicable,
       IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2.

       aircrew unless required for syllabus requirements or to meet program objectives.
       4.1.4.7. 83 FWS aircrew will maintain ACBT currency and may fly in the RCP of
       aircraft participating in WSEP at the discretion of 83 FWS/CC.
       4.1.4.8. Visits/Deployments. Only qualified USAFWS instructors will be sent on
       weapons school visits/deployments. During visits, USAFWS instructors may perform FL
       and instructor duties during tactical missions. When flying with students during
       deployments to FTUs, USAFWS IPs will occupy the Front Cockpit (FCP).
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the Aircrew Ground
Training Requirements listed in the RTM (NOTE: The RTM will not include ancillary training
requirements). Where conflicts exist between the RTM and the reference guidance, the reference
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                29


guidance takes precedence. Waiver authority is IAW the reference guidance. Ground training
accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle
in which it was accomplished.
   4.2.1. MTC: The minimum training requirements in the RTM will be accomplished in the
   best available simulator. The MAJCOM (through the RTM) or the SQ/CC will determine the
   required supervision for CT MTC missions. Units will develop scenarios that cover RAP-
   event MTC missions based on unit tasking and general systems knowledge requirements.
   Emphasis should be placed on skill-set training not readily available during daily flight
   activities. Units will review scenarios each training cycle. Aircrew may receive credit for
   training accomplished in non-MTC devices or HHQ-directed simulator test support, etc., if
   approved by the SQ/CC. Units must track all aircrew device training used to satisfy Basic
   Skills and RAP mission requirements.
      4.2.1.1. During EP missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished each
      training cycle: unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather
      entry, controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, controlled and
      uncontrolled ejection parameters, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, and
      precision instrument procedures during aircraft emergencies. Aircrew may use EP MTC
      missions to satisfy Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT) currency
      requirements.
      4.2.1.2. During RAP-event missions, training in the following areas will be
      accomplished each training cycle:        DOC-statement relevant simulated combat
      employment; threat recognition, reactions and counter tactics; aircraft subsystem failure
      checklist procedures (i.e. degraded ops); controlled flight departure recognition and
      recovery procedures; controlled and uncontrolled ejection parameters.
      4.2.1.3. ACDE MTC. See paragraph 3.5.2 Initial ACDE MTC training will count
      toward fulfilling CT requirements.
   4.2.2. SEPT.
      4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
      procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. SEPTs
      should be accomplished in the best available simulator to the maximum extent possible;
      however, tabletop training is acceptable. Tabletop SEPT will be accomplished one-on-
      one or in small flight-sized groups as long as all members participate fully and share
      equal time responding to emergency situations. One aircrew should present a situation
      and another discusses actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a
      logical conclusion. Any MAJCOM, OG, and SQ special interest items (SIIs) related to
      aircraft employment should be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into
      squadron SEPT programs:
          4.2.2.1.1. SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
          4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps/incidents (when applicable)
          as baseline cases.

          4.2.2.1.3. Discuss at least one EP for each major subsystem (Hydraulics, Electrical,
          Fuel, Flight Controls, Engines) in each session. The EPs should also span all phases
          of flight.
          4.2.2.1.4. Accomplish a minimum of three supervised SEPTs each training cycle
          with an instructor or SQ supervisor (SQ/CC, SQ/DO, SQ/ADO, Flt/CC). Include
          minimum fuel and emergency divert training.
       4.2.2.2. Aircrew will accomplish one SEPT every month. SEPT currency will expire at
       the end of the month if accomplished before the 20th or at the end of the following month
       if accomplished on or after the 21st (expiration is a grounding item until SEPT
       accomplished).
       4.2.2.3. Completion of an EP MTC profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement (to
       include any EPE either in the MTC or on the IOS administering the EPE).
       4.2.2.4. Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly requirement for the
       instructor who administers this training.
   4.2.3. Weapons and Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons and
   tactics academic training program to satisfy MQT requirements. FLUG and Instructor
   upgrade flows will include weapons and tactics academic training commensurate with the
   level of upgrade being accomplished. SQ/CCs will provide guidance to unit weapons shops
   on an annual CT weapons and tactics academics program that will ensure all aircrew are
   informed/reminded of new/current F-15E weapons, systems, and mission-specific TTPs.
   4.2.4. CT Verification updates aircrew on their squadron's wartime mission. Each CMR
   aircrew will participate in a squadron CT Verification as a briefer, board member, or seminar
   participant. BMC aircrew should participate in a CT Verification to facilitate future upgrade
   to CMR status, at the discretion of the SQ/CC. Aircrew who participate in a unit deployment
   to a tasked AOR may receive credit for CT Verification.
   4.2.5. CT Certification. Aircrews assigned to nuclear-tasked squadrons will Certify IAW
   AFI 10-419 and ACE Directive 75-6 (whichever is most restrictive). Aircrews who Certify
   are exempt from Verification requirements.
   4.2.6. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). Aircrew will participate in CT CRM
   training at the frequency stated in the RTM (reference AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resourse
   Management Training Program). Training builds upon the basic cockpit management skills
   taught in undergraduate pilot/WSO training and FTUs. Briefs and debriefs will include the
   core curriculum of CRM training IAW AFI 11-290 and the appropriate MAJCOM
   Supplements. The instructor CRM course may be used to satisfy the periodic requirement.
   Training will be tracked in ARMS. Failure to attend CRM training results in grounding
   (waiverable by OG/CC, but for a period not to exceed six months).
   4.2.7. NVG Refresher Academics. Refresher training as a minimum will consist of
   common NVG hazards, F-15E-specific hazards and limitations, performing preflight
   adjustment procedures, and focusing on an eye chart or use of the Hoffman 20/20 tester.
4.3. Flight Training. All aircrew except API-8 and ACC/IGS inspectors will accomplish the
requirements as shown on the F-15E Basic Skills Training Cycle Requirements table, published
in the current RTM. Failure to accomplish these requirements will not affect BAQ, BMC, or
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                31


CMR status but may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. API-8 flyers and
ACC/IGS inspectors will strive to accomplish the requirements as shown on this table.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. FS, GLO:
       4.4.1.1. A fully qualified FS (IAW AFI 11-202V2) may fly any tactical mission. GLOs
       will fly with an experienced pilot. Initial checkouts will be IAW para 3.6
       4.4.1.2. FS flight rates and requirements will be IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V2.
   4.4.2. MAJCOM/NAF API -8 Aircrew and ACC/IGS Flight Inspectors:
       4.4.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted
       in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit.
       MAJCOM/A3T and NAF/A3 are reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
          4.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is
          maintained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.4.2.1.2. Review assigned aircrew accomplishments and currencies prior to
          authorizing aircrew to participate in MDT.
          4.4.2.1.3. Provide each aircrew with written documentation specifying the mission
          types and events the aircrew is authorized to fly.
       4.4.2.2. HHQ personnel maintaining BMC flight status are exempt from non-grounding
       academic ground training, NAAR, CW training, and special training programs within
       authorized mission areas. Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron and
       HHQ supervisors will determine aircrew qualifications to participate in squadron
       scenarios for MDT.
       4.4.2.3. HHQ aircrew will:
          4.4.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
          4.4.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation to the supporting
          SQ/CC, SQ/DO or authorized representative prior to flights with that squadron.
          4.4.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission, and in coordination with squadron
          supervision, determine that their ability and proficiency will not be exceeded.
       4.4.2.4. Instructor-qualified aircrew may perform instructor duties with the concurrence
       of the OG/CC.
4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency.
   4.5.1. See AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V2 for guidance on authorization to obtain
   multiple qualification.
       4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels and
       MAJCOM/A3T to MAJCOM/A3. All requests must contain full justification. Approval
       for multiple qualification requests must be provided to the appropriate host aviation
       resource management (HARM) office; flights are not authorized until aircraft assignment
       is updated in ARMS.
 32                                                         AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      is assigned to the specific position and aircraft requested, or rescinded by MAJCOM/A3.
   4.5.2. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft. WG/CCs will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft. Either the
   WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the same aircraft
   selected by the WG/CC).
   4.5.3. Multiple Requirements. Aircrew will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie
   requirements in their primary aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP mission and event
   requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, aircrew will fly an equitable distribution of
   emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, non-precision approaches, and precision
   approaches in each MDS to fulfill their Basic Skills requirements.
   4.5.4. Multiple Currencies. Aircrew will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft. They
   will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.5.5. As required by the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1 and Volume 2, multiple
   qualified aircrew must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.
   4.5.6. Paragraphs 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 do not apply to Foreign Military Sales variants of the
   F-15E (ex. F-15I, F-15K, F-15S, F-15SG, F-15SA, etc). These aircraft are considered the
   same MDS. See paragraph 6.6 for differences training required to transition from an FMS
   variant to the F-15E.
4.6. Currencies, Recurrencies and Requalification.
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.1 defines currency requirements for BAQ/BMC/CMR aircrew. If
   an aircrew loses a particular currency, thereby requiring recurrency, that mission or event
   may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency as noted.
      4.6.1.1. Non-current events must be satisfied before the aircrew is considered
      certified/qualified (as applicable) to perform those events unsupervised. Loss of
      currencies annotated as affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR (see
      paragraph 4.7). Loss of currencies identified as not affecting CMR do not require
      regression, although they may result in grounding until training is completed (e.g.
      Aircrew Flight Equipment).
      4.6.1.2. Unless otherwise specified, recurrency supervision may fly either in the opposite
      cockpit or in a flight position that offers effective control of the mission.
   4.6.2. AOS Currency Requirements. Units will comply with AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft
   Delivery, for additional currencies required for flight delivery of aircraft coordinated through
   ACC AOS.
   4.6.3. Landing Recurrency (pilot), Sortie Recurrency (WSO). Loss of landing or sortie
   currency requires the following action as applicable (timing starts from the last landing in
   either cockpit (pilot), last sortie (WSO)):
      4.6.3.1. 31-90 days (46-90 Days for Experienced): Regain landing or sortie currency
      IAW Table 4.1.
      4.6.3.2. 91-135 days: Above item, plus instructor supervised MTC (may be either a
      qualified IP/IW or MTC contract instructor) with the following emphasis items: AFTTP
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                    33


     3-1.F-15E tactics, normal/instrument procedures, and EPs. Note: The level of tactical
     training will be commensurate with the certifications/qualifications of the aircrew.
     4.6.3.3. 136-210 (225 for Experienced) days: All above items, plus closed and open
     book Stan/Eval examinations (IAW AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 6) and EPE (Mission EPE
     for CMR aircrew, Instrument or Mission EPE for BMC aircrew). The open/closed book
     exams and EPE will be documented on the AF Form 8 as SPOT evaluations IAW with
     AFI 11-202V2.
     4.6.3.4. 211 (Inexperienced) / 226 (Experienced) or more days: IQT (see paragraph
     1.4.1 and Chapter 2), LASDT re-certification (see paragraph 3.4.6), and weapons event
     requalification (see paragraph 5.2).
  4.6.4. Loss of Instructor Status and Requalification/Recurrency.
     4.6.4.1. In addition to the reasons listed in AFI 11-202V2 for losing Instructor
     qualification (e.g. failing a periodic evaluation), aircrew may lose instructor status for the
     following:
        4.6.4.1.1. Loss of instructor currency for greater than 180 days.
        4.6.4.1.2. They become noncurrent in a mission or event which causes removal from
        CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient
        importance to require complete decertification (but not a complete loss of
        qualification).
            4.6.4.1.2.1. As long as the affected aircrew still retains instructor qualification
            IAW AFI 11-202V2, recertification will be at the SQ/CC’s discretion.
            4.6.4.1.2.2. If the SQ/CC does not elect to decertify the individual or if the
            individual becomes noncurrent in missions or events which do not require
            removal from CMR/BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the
            instructor will not instruct that mission or event until the required currency is
            regained.
     4.6.4.2. Aircrew losing Instructor currency must accomplish the following:
        4.6.4.2.1. 61-180 Days. Instructor recurrency flight with another instructor in the
        same element. Sortie will be with an actual student to the max extent possible. Sortie
        may not be combined with a demanding mission recurrency sortie.
        4.6.4.2.2. Over 180 Days. Instructor evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-
        15EV2. Document evaluation on the AF Form 8 as a SPOT IAW AFI 11-202V2,
        Chapter 7.
  4.6.5. ACBT Recurrency. Aircrew losing currency in ACBT must accomplish the
  following events:
     4.6.5.1. 61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). BFM.
     4.6.5.2. 91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). AHC and BFM (NOTE: Events may be
     combined into one sortie; however, AHC must be completed before BFM.).
     4.6.5.3. Over 180 Days. Accomplish a tailored program as directed by the SQ/CC and
     documented in gradebook/training records.
     34                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


        4.6.6. NVG Demanding Mission Recurrency. Aircrew losing NVG demanding mission
        currency must accomplish the following events prior to unrestricted night operations. These
        items will be considered the only “NVG non-demanding” skill-sets/missions (i.e. daytime
        “non-demanding” skillsets/missions will not be used):
           4.6.6.1. 2-ship basic and tactical formation work, light drills and unit-specific mission
           elements.
           4.6.6.2. Minimum of one of the following night profiles or missions:
               4.6.6.2.1. Intercept IAW NVG-2 profile not to exceed 1v1, above 5,000 feet AGL or
               MSA whichever is higher.
               4.6.6.2.2. BSA above 5,000 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher (unless on TFR)
               4.6.6.2.3. Unopposed SAT above 5,000 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher IAW
               NVG-4 profile (unless on TF).
        4.6.7. JHMCS Recurrency: Pilots losing currency in JHMCS must accomplish the
        following:
           4.6.7.1. 121-180 Days (181-240 Experienced). Fly any JHMCS sortie with Table 4.1-
           directed supervision.
        4.6.7.2. Over 180 Days (240 Experienced). Re-accomplish JHMCS recertification IAW
        Chapter 6.

Table 4.1 NOTES: If not specified, supervisory requirements are IAW paragraph 4.6.1.2. See
Attachment 2 for specific mission, sortie and event definitions.
1. BAQ aircrew will fly supervised (IP/IWSO/SQ supervisor) when a non-demanding sortie is required.
2. Loss of currency for greater than six months results in unqualified status IAW AFI 11-202V2
3. Recurrency supervision level is IP in aircraft or chase, certified, current, and proficient in event. To
regain RCP IP landing currency, FCP must be occupied by a BMC/CMR pilot current and qualified in
landing.
4. Recurrency supervision for pilots is an Instructor certified, current, and proficient in event (in the
element). Recurrency supervision for WSOs is an experienced pilot (in the aircraft) certified, current, and
proficient in the event.
5. Recurrency supervision for pilots is an Instructor/FL Squadron Supervisor (in the element), certified,
current, and proficient in event (AAR requires an IP or FL Sq Supervisor). Recurrency supervision for
WSOs is an experienced pilot (in aircraft), certified, current, and proficient in the event.
6. If day VFR, the supervision level is a pilot, certified, current, and proficient in the event; all other times
require an IP IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
7. Recurrency supervision is a current, experienced crewmate in the same aircraft.
8. An instructor-taught academic review is required prior to recurrency flight.
9. Performance or instruction (from either cockpit) will update currency. For formal course instructors:
CT and exercise participation require currency as listed; formal syllabus training missions require 180
days currency.
10. Flight leads may update currency from either lead or wing position. Recurrency will be accomplished
from wing position. Wingmen will only update currency from wing position.
11. FTU instructors may fly the recurrency event IAW student syllabus guidelines.
12. Currency is required to perform the event at or below 1,000 feet AGL in the aircrew's LOWAT
category (Category I, II, III). Loss of currency requires regression to the next higher category that the
event is current. Operations in a lower block category will update the higher block categories. Recurrency
requires satisfactory performance in the following events: vertical awareness training, hard turns, tactical
formation, and offensive/defensive maneuvering.
13. See paragraph 4.6.4. IP RCP landing currency is 45 days. WIC student sorties count as instructor
sorties for currency.
15. Updated by an actual weapons release on a class A/B/C range.
16. No NVG demanding events (para A2.1.22.) are allowed during NVG recurrency sortie.
17. ACT (2v2 min) currency is required for ACT engagements greater than 2v2. ACT 2v2 event satisfies
this currency. Opposed A/G missions that constitute ACT (2v2 min) update this currency.
18. Supervision will be JHMCS current and certified IP or SQ Supervisor (SQ/CC or SQ/DO) in the
element.

     4.7. Regression (see Figure 4 1):
         4.7.1. BMC/CMR Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training
         missions and Contingency Operations sorties may be used for lookback. Only one RAP Basic
         Skills mission (AHC, Inst) may be applied toward lookback per month. If an aircrew does
         not meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CC can: regress the
         aircrew to N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable; remove the aircrew from a BMC/CMR manning
         position; or initiate action to remove the aircrew from active flight status.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                 37


       4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month lookback requires a review of the aircrew's 3-month
       sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, aircrew may, at SQ/CC discretion,
       remain in CMR/BMC status. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in
       regression to N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable, or the aircrew may be placed in probation
       status for 1 month at the SQ/CC's discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to
       remove an aircrew from probation and preserve the current status is to reestablish a 1-
       month lookback at the end of the probation period.
       4.7.1.2. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The aircrew must
       maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply
       probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1 if a new CMR/BMC aircrew fails to
       meet 1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month
       lookback will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status.
   4.7.2. Regression for Failed Evaluations. In addition to the requirements of AFI 11-202V2
   and AFI 11-2F-15EV2, aircrew who fail a periodic evaluation will regress to N-CMR/N-
   BMC as applicable. Aircrew will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until accomplishing AFI 11-
   202V2 requalification requirements and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
   4.7.3. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   qualification at the end of the training cycle will require:
       4.7.3.1. For events tasked as QUAL at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC,
       as applicable. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew must re-achieve qualification IAW
       initial-qualification standards in the deficient weapons event (See paragraph 5.2).
       Events accomplished for this requalification may count toward the cumulative CT event
       qualification required at the end of the next training cycle.
       4.7.3.2. For events tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC, as
       applicable. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew must accomplish at least three of the
       weapons deliveries under the supervision of a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events
       accomplished may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the
       end of the next training cycle.
4.8. End of Cycle Requirements. Aircrew who fail to complete mission or event requirements
by the end of training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude
of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9 for proration guidance. In all cases, report training
shortfalls IAW RTM instructions.
   4.8.1. Aircrew who fail to meet annual RAP Basic Skills event or minimum total sortie
   requirements may continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will
   determine if additional training is required.
   4.8.2. Failure to meet specific BMC and CMR mission type requirements will result in one
   of the following:
       4.8.2.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines the mission type
       deficiency is significant. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew will complete all deficient
       mission types. These missions may also be counted toward the total requirements for the
       new training cycle.

       4.8.2.2. Continuation at BMC/CMR if total RAP missions and lookback are maintained
       and the mission type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC. The SQ/CC
       will determine if any additional training is required to address shortfall.
   4.8.3. Failure to accomplish missions/events required for Special Capabilities or
   Certifications/Qualifications will result in loss of that certification/qualification. The SQ/CC
   will determine re-certification requirements. Requalification requirements are IAW AFI 11-
   202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC
may prorate any training requirements precluded by the following events: Initial arrival date in
squadron, Duties Not Involving Flight (DNIF), emergency leave, Consecutive Overseas Tour
(COT) leave, non-flying TDYs or exercises, or combat/contingency operations. Ordinary annual
leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather or other environmental
factors that prevent the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as
non-availability. The following guidelines apply:
   4.9.1. Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flight in the training
   cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period
   of cumulative non-flying calendar days.
   4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished, an aircrew's training cycle will start over at a
   prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT.
   4.9.4. No requirement may be prorated below one. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of
   less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower whole number (one or greater).
   4.9.5. Newly assigned or converted aircrew and aircrew achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th
   of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration
   purposes. A prorated share of RAP missions must be completed in CT.
   4.9.6. Night and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward
   prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the aircrew was
   declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM in the RTM.
   4.9.7. An aircrew's last month on station prior to PCSing may be prorated provided 1
   month's proration is not exceeded. Individuals PCSing may be considered CMR for reporting
   purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency,
   port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first.
   4.9.8. CMR aircrew who attend USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported
   throughout the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those aircrew will accomplish a prorated share of
   mission and event requirements.
   4.9.9. Contingency Operations. The following proration procedures are intended to
   provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program.
       4.9.9.1. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as
       contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward annual RAP
       requirements (except AAR) but will be used for lookback purposes. All events may be
       used to update currencies. Upon relief from contingency operations, units will prorate
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                39


      RAP missions and events for the period of time each individual was tasked. Additionally,
      proration is authorized for spin-up and reconstitution where home station flights are
      reduced by MAJCOM.
      4.9.9.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
      considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
      logged as RAP missions. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
      requirements, and these missions and events may not be prorated.
      4.9.9.3. Upon release from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
      the missions to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of
      valid RAP missions as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable mission
      proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion
      based on the events accomplished during valid RAP missions.
   4.9.10. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
   SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for
   the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flight).

Table 4.2. Proration Allowance.
                         CUMULATIVE            MONTHS OF
                         DAYS OF               PRORATION
                         NONFLYING             ALLOWED

                         Over 345              12
4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   qualifications or event requirements, re-certification/re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7
   4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7, the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the aircrew came off CMR/BMC status):
 40                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. Complete a SQ/CC approved re-certification program
      (documented in the gradebook/training records) to return the aircrew to CMR/BMC
      standards. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR/BMC aircrew must
      also meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC
      status. The missions and events accomplished during the re-certification program may be
      credited towards their total/type mission and event requirements for the training cycle as
      well as for their monthly mission requirement. In addition, all RAP event currencies must
      be regained. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-
      certification to CMR.
      4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as above, plus open/closed book qualification
      examinations (IAW AFI 11-202V2, Chap 6, and AFI 11-2F-15EV2). Open/closed book
      exams will be documented on the AF Form 8 as SPOT IAW AFI 11-202V2 Chapter 7.
      4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Reaccomplish a SQ/CC-directed MQT program to
      include a formal MSN evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2.
4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process:
   4.11.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR aircrew with a 1 and 3 month lookback
   requirement of 8 and 24 RAP missions respectively. On Feb 3, he flew an ACBT mission
   prior to departing for a non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. He reported back for flight
   duty on 6 Apr. What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return?
      4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as accountable CMR aircrew for
      reporting purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the
      mandatory 1 month lookback (Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew 1 RAP mission, failing
      the 1 month lookback. The Flt/CC then performed a 3 month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb).
      This showed that he flew only 20 missions for this period. Had he flown four more
      missions, his SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. However, with 20 missions,
      Capt Smith did not meet the 3 month lookback for a CMR aircrew. The SQ/CC could
      regress Capt Smith to Non-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still
      carrying him as CMR.
      4.11.1.2. The SQ/CC decided to carry Capt Smith on 1 month probation. On 1 Apr, Capt
      Smith's 1 month lookback (Mar) was 0 missions. The SQ/CC must now regress Capt
      Smith to Non-CMR. When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a re-
      certification program. Upon completing this program, Capt Smith will need to re-
      establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to do so would force him to be reported
      Non-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
      4.11.1.3. If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could
      fly a non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR
      purposes, Capt Smith would need to fly 8 RAP missions to recapture his 1-month
      lookback and get off probation. Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC
      flew him with an IP on his first few sorties in order to regain his landing, AAR, LOWAT,
      and Formation T/O and Landing currencies.
      4.11.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 Sep, the SQ/CC prorated two months off
      of Capt Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in
      one RAP mission category. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to Non-CMR if the
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                           41


      deficiency was deemed significant. After accomplishing the tailored recertification
      program (the deficient missions), the SQ/CC would re-certify Capt Smith to CMR. This
      training also counts for the new training cycle.

4.12. G-Awareness CT. Units will develop a CT program that provides feedback to aircrew
and imprints a proper AGSM so that it becomes an integral part of pulling Gs.
42                                                       AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


  4.12.1. The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, instructor, FS, and, if
  available, aerospace physiologist the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's DVR to
  ensure a proper AGSM is being performed. This program also makes assessment of the
  AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight. The assessment should be done as a normal
  part of tape review while debriefing other tactical portions of the mission.
  4.12.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
     4.12.2.1. Ground training/academics will focus on technique and assessment and will
     include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft/aircrew performance as a result
     of an ineffective AGSM. Emphasis will also be placed on briefing, debriefing, and
     assessing the proper AGSM during flight debriefs.
     4.12.2.2. Units will include "AGSM effectiveness" on MQT and "AGSM assessment" on
     FLUG and IPUG/IWUG grade sheets. These areas will be evaluated on upgrade sorties
     where a G-ex is required.
     4.12.2.3. FLs will emphasize G-awareness during appropriate portions of the flight brief.
     4.12.2.4. G-awareness exercises will be performed IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-3.F-
     15E, filmed in HUD only (for DVR equipped aircraft, ensure the actual HUD, not HUD
     repeater, is selected as one of the recording channels) and in hot mic (ensure RCP
     extraneous volumes are turned down so as not to bleed over on the recording).
     4.12.2.5. The tactical portion of all basic skill-set missions (BFM, BSA, ACM, etc.) will
     be flown in hot mic to enable assessment of the AGSM. Intercom volumes will be set at a
     level which is comfortable for the aircrew but still allow assessment of AGSM technique
     in the debrief. For demanding missions, it is highly desired for aircrew to fly in hot mic.
     The purpose of this is to identify breakdowns in the AGSM that commonly occur during
     high task portions of a mission.
  4.12.3. Aircrew identified as having poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be
  identified to the Flt/CC or appropriate SQ supervisor. SQ supervision will determine what
  action is required to improve the aircrew's G-tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if
  Commander-Directed Acceleration Training is required IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge
  Training for High-G Aircrew.
  4.12.4. The involvement of the aerospace medical team is important to the success of this
  program.
  4.12.5. Units will develop a program to ensure an A/A mission tape for each aircrew is
  reviewed each training cycle by the squadron FS, Aerospace Physiologist, or SQ/CC-
  designated squadron supervisor (SQ/DO, SQ/ADO, Flt CC).

               WEAPONS DELIVERY/EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and
maintaining CT qualification in the delivery of A/G weapons and the employment of A/A
weapons. Refer to "Glossary of Events" at Attachment 2 for further guidance on weapons
events.
5.2. Initial Qualification:
   5.2.1. Aircrew must accomplish initial qualification in any weapons event requiring qual at
   CMR/BMC. Initial qualification achieved in IQT or MQT satisfies requirements for CT
   initial qualification, but not for CT event requirements. Initial qualification will carry over
   for consecutive tours in the F-15E.
   5.2.2. Initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the aircrew has achieved a
   minimum of 3 hits (IAW AFTTP 3-1) out of 6 consecutive record deliveries (see paragraph
   A2.2.2.2).
   5.2.3. Strafe deliveries may be accomplished from basic (e.g. academic range pattern) or
   tactical (e.g. CAS-wheel) deliveries. Prior to initial qualification in strafe, there is no limit to
   the number of hot passes.
   5.2.4. A/A Missile. Qualification is achieved by meeting the qualification criteria for
   weapons employment IAW 11-2F-15EV2. Qualification in one missile category is assumed
   for other missile categories in such cases where only one type of missile was employed.
   5.2.5. A/A Gun. Qualification is achieved by meeting the qualification criteria for weapons
   employment IAW 11-2F-15EV2 and verified through tape assessment of an A/A gun
   engagement. Additionally, qualification may be achieved by an individual (i.e., element or
   team hit is not applicable for initial qualification) hit during a live fire pass on a Deployable
   Aerial Reflective Target/Aerial Gunnery Target System (DART/AGTS) target.
5.3. CT Qualification:
   5.3.1. These criteria establish the minimum standards for an aircrew to maintain
   qualification in the appropriate RAP-tasked weapons delivery events and do not necessarily
   determine evaluation criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g.,
   inspection/evaluation teams). These qualifications are valid throughout the subsequent
   training period.
   5.3.2. CT weapons deliveries will be tactical deliveries or intercepts simulating realistic
   employment of Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML) munitions, considering such factors
   as fuzing, safe separation, recovery using applicable safe escape maneuver, egress, etc. CT
   A/G weapons event requirements will be accomplished on scoreable ranges to the maximum
   extent practical.
   5.3.3. Aircrew will maintain weapons qualification IAW the following guidance (applies to
   each training period).
       5.3.3.1. Complete the RTM-directed minimum number of weapons events.
 44                                                        AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


       5.3.3.2. On at least 50% of each type weapons event, achieve hot-pass hit criteria IAW
       this volume or dry-pass hit criteria IAW “kill” criteria in AFTTP 3-1 Shot/Kill.
       Exception: A/A missile employment (see paragraph 5.3.6.).
   5.3.4. Failure to qualify in one event does not invalidate qualification in others. SQ/CCs may
   declare an aircrew unqualified in an event(s) and invalidate all previous record deliveries for
   that event at any time during a training cycle without affecting other weapons event
   qualifications. If qualification is required at BMC/CMR, failure to qualify will result in
   regression to N-BMC/N-CMR (see paragraph 4.7) until weapons re-qualification is
   accomplished.
   5.3.5. At the end of the training cycle, each aircrew's weapons delivery scores will be
   reviewed to assess the aircrew's weapons qualification. If qualified, the aircrew's weapons
   qualification is valid through the following training period.
   5.3.6. A/A weapons employment will be assessed for validity IAW AFTTP 3-1 Shot/Kill
   criteria and the results in each tasked weapon will be recorded for the current training period.
   Qual requires 75 percent valid shots for A/A missiles at pickle. FAM requires ten events,
   with no hit percentage specified.
   5.3.7. Gun Employment.
       5.3.7.1. Strafe. Maximum of four passes for record if planned delivery parameters
       remain the same. Multiple strafe for the same type event is authorized if cockpit rounds
       count is declared between events and the appropriate total number of rounds are available
       from the limiter. Aircrew will be charged actual rounds fired or rounds declared per
       event, whichever is greater, for each event.
       5.3.7.2. DART. DART qualification criteria (other than initial) using combat/tactical
       patterns, is one hit on DART as sole shooter; or at least one hit during sequential attack
       tactics when both shooters have fired on DART and tape reviews verify that sufficient
       tracking was accomplished during actual time of fire to warrant crediting a hit to each
       element member.
       5.3.7.3. AGTS/Improved AGTS (IAGTS). 5 sensor scored hits are required.
5.4. Weapons Delivery Parameters. The following event parameters and requirements form
the basic framework for aircrew weapons delivery training and all deliveries will conform to
limits established for each specific event.
   5.4.1. Gunnery Events. Pattern descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul criteria are
   contained in AFTTP 3-3.F-15E, Combat Fundamentals, AFI 11-2F-15E, Volume 3, F-15E
   Operations Procedures, and AFI 11-214.
       5.4.1.1. Low Angle Strafe (LAS). Dive angle of 15 degrees or less. Foul line is 2,000
       feet. Minimum recovery altitude (MRA) is 75 feet AGL. AFI 11-214 and AFI 11-2F15-
       EV3 restrictions for night deliveries apply. Aircraft rounds limiter will normally be set to
       provide at least 100 scoreable rounds per sortie.
       5.4.1.2. High Angle Strafe (HAS). Dive angle greater than 15 degrees. MRA is above
       aircrew LOWAT category minimums (day) / IAW AFI 11-214 and AFI 11-2F-15EV3
       (night). Aircraft rounds limiter will normally be set to provide at least 100 scoreable
       rounds per sortie.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                  45


     5.4.1.3. Hit Criteria. Dry-pass hit criteria, regardless of event type, is IAW kill criteria
     in AFTTP 3-1 Shot/Kill. Hot-pass hit criteria is IAW the following guidance (an “actual
     observed hit” is defined as either an acoustic-score count, RCO assessed “hit”, or tape-

           be computed to ensure safe escape/separation/fuze arm for ordnance
           simulated/delivered. MRA is the aircrew's LOWAT certification or range/target area
           restrictions, whichever is higher. If this delivery is used for a Laser Guided Bomb
           (LGB) event, use paragraph 5.4.3.2 Hit criteria is: 175 feet (53m).
   5.4.3. Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) Events:
       5.4.3.1. Enhanced Guided Bomb Unit (EGBU)-15/Air-to-Ground Missile (AGM)-
       130. A level or climbing delivery, initiated from a direct or indirect attack, designed to

           5.4.3.1.2. Hit criteria for simulated release is target locked on at data-link termination
           (with manual steering and target in FOV at data-link termination). Note: An aircrew
           delivering (but not guiding) a EGBU-15/AGM-130 does not receive credit for a
           EGBU-15/AGM-130 delivery. Tape review of the guiding aircraft will be used to
           evaluate delivery accuracy (target within FOV prior to guidance commands).
       5.4.3.2. LGB Event. An event in which the combat/training laser is employed to guide
       simulated/actual LGB ordnance during a given delivery. Minimum recovery is safe
       escape/fuze arm/guide time required for the ordinance being simulated/delivered. Hit
       criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1 A/G Shot/Kill Criteria.
           5.4.3.2.1. In case of a buddy guide delivery, only the releasing aircraft (or mule) will
           also receive credit for the particular delivery event (e.g. HARB if released above 10k
           feet). The guiding aircraft (guider) only receives credit for an LGB Event.
       5.4.3.3. Inertially Aided Munition (IAM). An event in which an aircraft system is used
       to determine release parameters for INS/GPS aided/guided munitions [e.g. Joint Direct
       Attack Munition (JDAM), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Small
       Diameter Bomb (SDB), etc.]. Simulated or actual delivery of ordnance is required. MRA
       is safe escape for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1
       A/G Shot/Kill Criteria.
           5.4.3.3.1. In the event that a member of a formation finds and designates the target
           to aid in IAM employment for another member of the formation (i.e. using FDL to
           transfer designations), the formation member that designated the target may take
           credit only for an IAM event, but the formation member that delivered the weapon
           may take credit for both a delivery event (e.g. HARB) and an IAM event.
           5.4.3.3.2. If an IAM also has the capability to be terminally guided by laser energy
           (e.g. GBU-54), aircrew may take credit for both an LGB event and an IAM event if
           the laser was used to affect terminal guidance of the weapon.
5.5. Full Scale/Live Ordnance. Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD) and live ordnance
training is essential to establish and maintain aircrew combat capability. As a goal, commanders
will attempt to give each aircrew the opportunity to deliver and employ as many types of

      upgrade, pilots and WSOs will be certified to instruct strike missions.
6.5. MC Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for upgrade to MC.
   6.5.1. MC Responsibilities. The MC is responsible for the plan, coordination, brief,
   execution, and debrief of large force packages (including joint/composite forces). MCs, once
   certified, are authorized to lead large force missions. MCs may delegate authority and
   responsibility for a portion of the mission to a deputy MC. For example, an F-15E MC tasked
   with an A/G role may delegate OCA MC duties to an OCA flight lead who is MC certified.
   6.5.2. MC Prerequisites. SQ/CCs will consider ability, judgment, technical expertise, skill,
   and experience when selecting crewmembers for mission commander upgrade. Minimum
   qualifications are 4-ship FL or IWSO.
   6.5.3. Ground Training. Upgrading MCs must satisfactorily complete the following unit
   developed blocks of instruction prior to certification:
      6.5.3.1. Mission Planning Considerations. Range space and availability, ATC
      restrictions/considerations/flight plans, AAR operations, inter-unit coordination, A/A and
      A/G force integration, Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) penetration and avoidance,
      on-range control agency coordination, GCI coordination.
      6.5.3.2. Review appropriate AFTTP 3-1 volumes for specific MC checklists and
      considerations.
   6.5.4. Flight Training. As a minimum, the upgrading MC will observe a certified MC
   during the planning, brief, flight, and debrief of at least one large force mission. Prior to
   certification, the MC upgradee will then plan, brief, fly, and debrief a minimum of one
   mission under the supervision of an IP, IWSO, or squadron supervisor (SQ/CC, SQ/DO,
   SQ/ADO, Flt/CC) who is MC certified. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for
   upgrade to MC.
      6.5.4.1. Unit tasks should drive force composition, adversaries, and minimum flight size.
      However, to count as a MC sortie, the upgrading MC must be acting as the MC for a
      large force mission responsible for two or more types of aircraft with four or more total
      aircraft or more than four F-15E aircraft versus a minimum of two pre-planned
      adversaries.
      6.5.4.2. The supervising MC will determine overall upgrade mission effectiveness in
      case of fallout.

   6.5.5. Certification. Following satisfactory completion of the above requirements, the
   SQ/CC will certify a new MC by placing a letter of certification in the training folder and
   indicating certification on letter of X's.
6.6. F-15E Variant Differences Training. Using AFI 11-202 Vol 1 definitions, transitioning
from an F-15E FMS variant to the F-15E requires differences training only; out-of-cycle
checkrides are not required. Landing currency (pilot) and Sortie currency (WSO) may be
transferred from the FMS F-15E variant to the F-15E, recurrency will be IAW para. 4.6.3.
Qualification/Re-qualification will be accomplished as necessary IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI
11-2F-15EV2. Differences training will be at the discretion of the SQ/CC using the following
guidelines.
   6.6.1. Academics. Academic instruction should be tailored to the aircrew's previous
   experience and should concentrate on the differences between the two variants and unit
   missions. Instruction should address avionics system, electrical systems, engine differences
   (as applicable), flight control system differences (as applicable), aircraft handling
   characteristics (including departure susceptibility), EPs, MSOGS normal and emergency
   operation (if transitioning from a LOX equipped A/C), both A/A and A/G radar modes, and
   cockpit layouts.

     6.6.4.4. DELETED
  6.6.5. EGBU-15/AGM-130 Instructor Upgrade. Only the most qualified EGBU-
  15/AGM-130 aircrew will upgrade to instructor. They will review all ground training and
  simulator requirements, paying particular attention to the opposite cockpit switchology
  (upgrading WSOs should fly at least one MTC in the FCP and upgrading pilots at least one
  MTC in the RCP). Flight training profiles will follow these guidelines:
     6.6.5.1. EGBUI-1, Systems/Tactics Instruction. Mission Objectives: Perform and
     instruct EGBU-15 tactics. Specific Tasks: Demonstrate ability to instruct mission
     planning, preflight, ground and airborne checks, opposite cockpit switchology, EO/IR
     search, target acquisition and lock-on, navigation, platform and gate slew, DL Pod
     operation, PSA maneuvers, level and stabilized climb deliveries, egress maneuver, crew
     coordination, captive weapon profiles, solving line-of-sight and other standoff problems,
     and min-comm tactics. Tasks: Same as EGBU-4. If stand-off tactics are not performed
     they should be discussed in detail in the debrief.
     6.6.5.2. AGMI-2, Combat Tactics Instruction. Mission Objectives: Demonstrate
     proficiency in systems instruction and tactics for the AGM-130. Emphasis will be on
     instruction of mission planning and briefs, ground and airborne system checks, crew
     coordination and pacing, in-flight control of navigation, formation, and tasks, search
     techniques and target acquisition, lock-on and terminal guidance, abnormal procedures,
     and low and medium altitude indirect attacks. Upgradee must demonstrate proficiency in
     mission reconstruction during the debrief.
  6.6.6. EGBU-15/AGM-130 CT:
     6.6.6.1. Academics. EGBU-15/AGM-130 refresher academics are required every 6
     months for all EGBU-15 qualified aircrew.
     6.6.6.2. Simulator Training. If a MTC certified for EGBU-15/AGM-130 training is
     available, EGBU-15/AGM-130 aircrew will devote at least 1.5 hours of MTC time during
     each training cycle to gain proficiency in target acquisition, tracking, and operation in a
     restricted ceiling and visibility environment. Both high and low altitude attack profiles
     will be accomplished. If a certified MTC is not available, the contractor simulator should
     be used, if practical.
     6.6.6.3. CT Flights. Profiles are at the discretion of the SQ/CC. The delivery of actual
     or inert weapons provides the only real validation of the unit training programs and
     systems reliability. Units should attempt to expend their allocation of EGBU-15/AGM-
     130 ordnance each training cycle. A squadron designated EGBU-15/AGM-130 officer
 56                                                         AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


       will set up a squadron training program to ensure training flights are as realistic as
       possible within the constraints of MAJCOM and airspace restrictions.
6.7. Pre-Deployment Spin-Up Training. Spin-up training will be IAW AFCENT Aviation
Unit Prep Message (AUPM) as posted on the 561 JTS SIPR Website
(http://www.nellis.af.smil.mil/units/561jts/aef/uscentaf.aspx) and modified as needed by the
SQ/CC to meet supported COCOM and associated air component requirements. The 561st JTS
has supplemental information available on the 561 JTS AOR Spin-up SIPR Website
(http://www.nellis.af.smil.mil/units/561jts/aef/) that aids the SQ/CC to focus on missionized
specific tasks and training. OG/CCs will ensure participating aircrew are ready to deploy and are
able to conduct all missions in support of expected tasks
6.8. NVG Certification: Upon successful completion of IQT IAW formal FTU course syllabi
(B-Course, TX1/2/3, and SOC), F-15E aircrew will be NVG certified. The purpose of this
section is to provide guidance on the certification of NVG FLs and instructors.
   6.8.1. NVG FL. Certified NVG pilots who upgrade to FL need one supervised (IP/IWSO or
   FL-certified SQ/CC or SQ/DO) flight as a FL on an NVG sortie before performing
   unsupervised NVG FL duties. The supervised flight may be conducted at anytime during or
   after the FLUG syllabus.
   6.8.2. NVG Instructor. A NVG Instructor must accomplish the following before being
   certified to perform instructor duties while using NVGs:
       6.8.2.1. Fly a total of 10 sorties with NVGs (this includes all sorties flown with NVGs
       from initial certification onward).
       6.8.2.2. Fly one supervised (IP/IWSO) instructional night sortie under NVGs before
       performing unsupervised night instructor duties while under NVGs.
   6.8.3. IAW AFI 11-401, NVG time as logged on the AF Form 781 may only be logged while
   actually using goggles.
6.9. JHMCS Certification. The purpose of this program is to certify aircrew in JHMCS
operation, employment, and instruction. The program outlined below is the minimum required
for certification and may be modified by SQ/CC based on unit needs, previous experience, and
documented performance.
   6.9.1. General Instructions.
       6.9.1.1. CMR/BMC pilots may conduct JHMCS certification separately or as part of any
       upgrade.
       6.9.1.2. JHMCS-Instructor can be flown in conjunction with unit IPUG/IWUG program.
   6.9.2. Ground Training. Academics will be accomplished locally or during MTC
   orientation (if available), but will be accomplished within 60 days prior to the first sortie. If
   more than 60 days elapse between academics and the first sortie, aircrew will re-accomplish
   academics.
   6.9.3. Flying Training. Basic JHMCS certification is two sorties. Instructors must complete
   JHMCS certification (IPs: both academics and flights, IWs: academics only) before
   instructing either on JHMCS certification sorties or sorties where the student pilot is using
   the JHMCS.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                    57

       JHMCS. Specific Mission Tasks: Practice JHMCS ground procedures, HMD alignment,
       HOTAS, display orientation/interpretation, radar/missile cueing, and High Off Boresight
       (HOBS) WEZ recognition/weapons employment with emphasis on crew coordination
       6.9.3.2. JHMCS-A/G. Skill-set Objectives: Introduce/practice A/G employment using
       JHMCS. Specific Mission Tasks: low-level navigation, threat reactions, 2-ship low and
       med altitude weapons employment, weapons employment in the CAS environment,
       HMD ground symbology interpretation, and TGP/Radar cueing all with an emphasis on
       crew coordination.
6.10. Homeland Air Defense Augmentation. This program applies to all aircrew tasked to
augment AF North (1 AF) in the Homeland Air Defense role for Peacetime Alert, NORAD
CONPLAN implementation or similar CONUS air defense emergency. The ground training
requirements of this section are for planning purposes and may be modified to meet unique unit
requirements.
   6.10.1. MQT/Certification. The following training requirements will be incorporated into
   the MQT and Air Defense certification programs of units identified for this mission in the
   unit DOC statement. Units tasked with Homeland Air Defense based on an AEF tasking will
   use the outline below as minimum criteria to certify aircrew (training not to precede actual
   tasking by greater than 6 months):
       6.10.1.1. Academics. AF North and ACC mission/organization, authentication
       procedures, applicable plans, facilities locations, call signs, ADA corridor procedures,
       safe passage procedures, alert procedures, ROE (NORAD Regulation 55-6), AFI 11-214
       procedures, and applicable sections of AFTTP 3-1.
       6.10.1.2. MTC Training. Two MTC missions dedicated to an Air Defense scenario
       including a SOCC scramble, handover, voice authentication, CAP procedures, controller-
       directed VID profiles, low altitude intercepts below 1,000 feet AGL, ECCM intercepts,
       and weapons employment.
   6.10.2. CT. Air Defense augmentees will accomplish the following annual training
   requirements:
       6.10.2.1. Academic and MTC training covering appropriate areas as listed above.
       6.10.2.2. Aircrew will maintain LOWAT currency IAW Table 4.1
   6.10.3. Air Defense Training Resources. Necessary materials for the training listed in
   paragraph 6.10.1.1, NORAD/CONR/Sector guidance, and Air Defense mission “Smart
   Packs” are available on the 1AF/A3V ASA One-Stop Shop SIPR web site.
   6.10.4. Low/Slow Speed VID Procedures:
       6.10.4.1. The purpose of this training is to assist units tasked to support OPERATION
       NOBLE EAGLE (ONE) or any Homeland Defense mission.
       6.10.4.2. The intent is to prepare aircrew for intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary
       and fixed wing).
 58                                                        AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


       6.10.4.3. Unit-developed academics should be conducted during weapons and tactics
       training with emphasis on ONE/Homeland Defense ROE and the specific TTPs and
       LIMFACs of operating the F-15E in the low/slow-speed environment.
       6.10.4.4. Flight training should, to the maximum extent possible, include helicopter and
       light aircraft operations and considerations. Creation of a realistic environment to allow
       full use of F-15E EID/ VID capabilities is essential to the conduct of low/slow-speed
       operations. SQ/CCs will determine the depth of ground and flight training necessary prior
       to participating in exercises and contingency operations.
6.11. CSAR. CSAR is a special capability used to support the recovery of downed aircrew in a
combat environment. This support includes on scene command (OSC), electronic and visual
search, threat suppression, helicopter escort and protection, and communications relay. Once
CSAR certified, certification is retained with aircraft MSN qualification (i.e. with a current MSN
check IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15EV2). The program below outlines the minimum
requirements to upgrade aircrew for CSAR operations. CSAR certification training will be
accomplished under the supervision of a certified CSAR instructor (see next paragraph). Search
and Rescue (SAR) is the peacetime subset that uses some of the skills of CSAR.
   6.11.1. Upon completion of CSAR-1 and CSAR-2, aircrew may fly as a CSAR wingman
   (formation position 2 or 4). Subsequent completion of CSAR-3 and CSAR-4 allows aircrew
   to lead CSAR missions from position 1 or 3 (pilots must also be FL certified). For
   instructors to be certified to instruct CSAR missions, they will teach a CSAR-3 or CSAR-4
   under the supervision of a certified CSAR IP/IWSO (may be accomplished in conjunction
   with IPUG/IWUG.
   6.11.2. CSAR certification and refresher training will be included as part of the Pre-
   Deployment Spin-up Training (see paragraph 6.7) for units tasked for CSAR during
   contingency operation deployments.
   6.11.3. Academics. See AFTTP 3-1.F-15E., Chapter 8, and JPub 3-50, Joint Doctrine for
   Personnel Recovery with the following highlights.
       6.11.3.1. General CSAR Procedures. Command and control, typical CSAR ordnance,
       tactics and techniques.
       6.11.3.2. Search Patterns and Procedures. Electronic and visual.
       6.11.3.3. Helicopter Escort. Rendezvous, rescue escort, and hover cover.
       6.11.3.4. Air Strike Control (ASC) Procedures. Target identification, ordnance
       selection, pre-strike preparation, target marking, strike control procedures, and bomb
       damage assessment (BDA).
   6.11.4. Flight Training. SQ/CCs may modify mission profiles as necessary to tailor initial
   and refresher training to unit and theater requirements. On-ground personnel acting as
   simulated survivor(s) are required on CSAR-1 and either CSAR-3, or CSAR-4. Helicopter
   support is required on CSAR-3, CSAR-4, and on either CSAR-1 or CSAR-2.
       6.11.4.1. CSAR-1 (Two to Four Aircraft, Survivor Required, Helicopter Required
       on CSAR-1 or CSAR-2). Mission Objective: Introduce search techniques and helicopter
       escort. Specific Mission Tasks: instructor introduces search procedures and helicopter
       escort. Ground personnel will demo ground marking techniques.

      ASC. Review search techniques and helicopter escort if assets are available. Specific
      Mission Tasks: instructor demonstrates OSC procedures using Number 2 as the
      communication focal point. Conduct search and suppression phases of a classic CSAR.
      Practice helicopter escort.
      6.11.4.3. CSAR-3 (Two to Four Aircraft, Survivor Required on CSAR-3 or CSAR-
      4, Helicopter Required). Mission Objectives: Demonstrate procedures and tactics
      necessary to coordinate and control an unopposed CSAR. Specific Mission Tasks: Lead a
      CSAR to include search, on-scene command, helicopter escort, and survivor preparation
      and pick-up.
      6.11.4.4. CSAR-4 (Two to Four Aircraft, Survivor Required on CSAR-3 or CSAR-
      4, Helicopter Required). Mission Objectives: Practice procedures and tactics necessary
      to coordinate and control an opposed CSAR. Specific Mission Tasks: Lead a CSAR to
      include search, OSC, threat suppression, helicopter escort, and survivor preparation and
      pick-up. The CSAR scenario should include as many outside assets as possible. These
      may include ground aggressors, strike fighters, FAC(A)s, etc.

   A2.1.8. Collateral Sorties. Sorties not directly related to combat employment or basic skills
   training but necessary for accomplishment of unit training programs, such as ferry flights,
   deployments, incentive flights, orientation flights, airshows, etc. MAJCOMs will normally
   assign collateral sorties in lump sum adjusted for local conditions and circumstances. These
   sorties are not required for RAP training purposes.
   A2.1.9. Commander Option Mission. Mission allocated by the unit commander to support
   individual training requirements and unit training objectives. BMC pilots may log a
   Commander Option Mission for any type of mission listed in the “Missions required” table of
   the RTM. CMR pilots may log any A-G mission from the same table or any other A-G
   mission deemed necessary by unit commander.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                  73


  A2.1.10. Contingency Sortie. A sortie tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency
  operation in which training is limited. These sorties are logged as Contingency Operations
  Sortie (SC13) in ARMS. These sorties and events accomplished on these sorties do not count
  towards annual RAP requirements, however, the sorties will be used for lookback and the
  events will be used to update currencies.
  A2.1.11. Defensive Counter Air (DCA). Mission designed to develop proficiency in
  Defensive Counter Air mission tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and
  planning; execution of tactics to detect, engage, and negate aircraft employing adversary
  tactics and weapons to penetrate protected airspace or target areas, and in-flight report.
  A2.1.12. Demanding Sortie. Sorties that task the aircrew to the extent that flight frequency
  and continuity are most critical. Missions and events requiring demanding mission currency
  are: (D)ACM, (D)ACT, LOWAT (below 1,000 feet AGL), CAS, SAT (except dry level
  passes at or above 500 feet), CFTR/LFE/COMAO, JFT, night missions, instructor duties,
  JAAT, aerial demonstrations, etc. SQ/CCs may add missions or events to the demanding list,
  depending on unit tasking and the individual's capabilities. Also see Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.1.13. Flight Lead 4-Ship (FL 4-Ship) Sortie. Special certification. Sortie where FL
  leads a flight of 4 or more. May be logged in conjunction with baseline training
  requirements.

  in the employment of the EGBU-15. Includes tactical mission planning, execution, and
  simulated or actual weapons delivery.
  A2.1.16. Instructor Sortie. Special qualification (see AFI 11-202V2). Sortie where the
  crewmember acted in an instructional capacity and valid combat training was secondary to
  execution of instructor duties.
  A2.1.17. Instrument Sortie. Basic skills sortie. Training designed to ensure instrument
  proficiency. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided they do not
  interfere with the primary goal of instrument training.
  A2.1.18. Mission Commander (MC) Mission. Special certification. Mission where
  aircrew acted as MC for a joint/composite mission responsible for two or more types of
  aircraft with four or more total aircraft, or more than four own MDS aircraft versus a
  minimum of two pre-planned adversary aircraft. May be logged in conjunction with other
  RAP mission requirements.
  A2.1.19. Night Sortie. Sortie where either takeoff or landing, and at least 50 percent of
  flight duration or 1 hour (whichever is less) occur between the end of evening civil twilight
  and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac
  (night definition IAW AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202V3).
  A2.1.20. Non-demanding Sortie. A day sortie that provides aircrew with the opportunity to
  regain basic flight proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been
 74                                                         AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


   underused during a non-flying period. Missions and events authorized on a non-demanding
   sortie are: Instruments, AHC, low level navigation at or above 500 feet AGL, basic weapons
   delivery, basic intercepts (to include Red Air flown under Limited training rules), BFM, etc.
   SQ/CCs may delete missions or events from this non-demanding list, depending on unit
   tasking and the individual's capabilities.
   A2.1.21. Non-effective Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a training mission, test
   mission, Basic Skills sortie, or collateral sortie that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE,
   maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish a sufficient number of planned events.
   A2.1.22. NVG Demanding Event: Includes: intercepts exceeding 1v1, BSA or SAT below
   5,000’ AGL or MSA whichever is higher (unless on TFR), opposed SAT and diving
   deliveries recovering below 5,000’ AGL.
   A2.1.23. Red Air Mission. A/A mission where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon systems,
   or maneuvering are limited to the extent that complete own MDS training is not
   accomplished. Restrictions that limit aircraft capabilities to some level which might be
   encountered in combat do not require logging the mission as Red Air. Instead of a minimum
   number required, Red Air mission allocations in the RTM have a maximum cap to limit
   degraded training.
   A2.1.24. Surface Attack Tactics (SAT). Mission designed to develop proficiency in A/G
   tactics in a combat environment. Mission elements include: mission planning, execution with
   actual or simulated threats, and weapons delivery IAW unit taskings, simulating UCML
   munitions, and SCLs against a tactical target during the day. Simulated attacks may be
   conducted against realistic targets IAW local restrictions. Mission types include: Strategic
   Attack (SA), Air Interdiction (AI), Offensive Counterair Air-to-Surface (OCA-S), Time-
   sensitive Targeting (TST), and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD).
   A2.1.25. Sweep Mission. Mission designed to develop proficiency in OCA sweep tactics.
   Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution of tactics
   designed to detect, engage, and negate simulated adversary aircraft which are operating
   within specific commit criteria (i.e., range, airspace corridor, vul time, etc.), and in-flight
   report. Intercept missions with Limited maneuvering that fulfill the above criteria may be
   logged as effective RAP training.
A2.2. Weapons Delivery Events. A delivery event is defined as a pass at a target on which
ordnance is expended or simulated and meets the criteria defining a specific weapon delivery
(EGBU-15, LGB, etc.). These delivery events will be used to update weapons qualifications and
currencies. Weapon events are defined in Chapter 5. All deliveries will be documented. If not
specified in a description, units will determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling or logging
weapons delivery events.
   A2.2.1. Delivery types:
       A2.2.1.1. Basic Delivery. A delivery using a conventional box pattern. It may be used
       as a record event only for initial qualification. There is no restriction on the number of
       dry passes made before or during basic deliveries in a record event for initial
       qualification; however, only the first two deliveries per event may be made for record.
AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011                                                                   75


     A2.2.1.2. Tactical Delivery. A delivery using patterns and techniques that minimize
     final flight path predictability, yet allow sufficient time for accurate weapons delivery.
     When a tactical delivery is flown for record, dry passes in the event are not permitted
     before or during the event. Wings level time on final will be limited to 5 seconds or less
     when aircraft will descend below 4,500 feet AGL. Timing will be from completion of
     roll-out until initiation of recovery. Exceeding 5 seconds will result in gross error. Level,
     LGB, and climbing deliveries may exceed 5 seconds. All tactical deliveries will
     normally include recovery to egress parameters.
  A2.2.2. Documentation:
     A2.2.2.1. Non-Record. Basic or Tactical weapons delivery accomplishments not
     credited toward weapons qualification.
     A2.2.2.2. Record. Conventional or nuclear delivery scored for individual weapons
     qualification. Scoring shall be accomplished by ground, air or AVTR scoring, as
     appropriate. A maximum of two (four for strafe) record deliveries may be accomplished
     during a mission from a single run-in heading. Additional record deliveries may be
     accomplished from headings differing by at least 90 degrees or on different targets. The
     first two (four for strafe) deliveries will be considered record unless otherwise declared
     prior to the roll-in to final. Record deliveries may not be preceded by non-record
     deliveries in the same event on the same mission. Scores will be documented by CEP and
     clock position. Additional guidelines are:
        A2.2.2.2.1. Basic. Must be scored on a Class A range.
        A2.2.2.2.2. Tactical. A minimum of 50% must be accomplished on a ground scored
        range (except for EGBU-15/AGM-130 events). Remaining record hits may be air
        scored by reference to known distances from the target.
        A2.2.2.2.3. Strafe. Aircraft rounds limiter will normally be set to deliver at least 100
        rounds per sortie. A minimum of 50 rounds per strafe event must be expended to
        satisfy RAP strafe requirements.
        A2.2.2.2.4. LGB. Designator and bomber functions may be accomplished
        simultaneously by a single aircraft or separately using buddy guide techniques. To
        record a complete LGB delivery, a simulated or actual weapons release and/or guide
        must be performed. Laser tracker accuracy may be scored by DVR or Laser Target
        Designator Scoring System (LTDSS).
     A2.2.2.3. RAP Tasking:
        A2.2.2.3.1. FAM. Weapons events tasked at FAM may be basic or tactical record
        deliveries. Each single pass counts as one delivery. Unless otherwise specified in the
        RTM or formal course syllabi, FAM tasking requires ten weapons deliveries or seven
        strafe passes per training cycle.
        A2.2.2.3.2. Qual. Weapons tasked at Qual must be tactical record deliveries. Qual
        tasking demonstrates the aircrew's capability to put appropriate ordnance on target.
        Unless otherwise specified in the RTM or formal course syllabi, Qual criteria is
        established for each event in Chapter 5.
 76                                                         AFI11-2F-15EV1 31 MARCH 2011


   A2.2.3. Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery Definitions to be Considered for Event
   Descriptions:
       A2.2.3.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended.
       Such dry passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the
       aircrew as gross error unless pass was dry because of safety interests, system
       malfunctions, basic delivery requirements, or directed for flight integrity purposes.
       A2.2.3.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent
       with established procedures or safety considerations. A foul will result in a gross error for
       that delivery (except non-accoustiscored strafe which will be penalized one-half the event
       score). Verbal warnings will not be substituted for fouls. A second foul or any dangerous
       pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that mission
       and a gross error score for the event. A foul will be charged IAW flying directive
       publications.

  receivers accomplish another rendezvous, hook-up and fuel transfer or dry hook-up.
  A2.3.3. Basic Intercept. A single or two-ship intercept performed with the express purpose
  of practicing fundamental radar acquisition and lock-on techniques, controlling intercept
  geometry against LIMITED maneuvering targets, recognizing weapons employment zones
  and taking valid shots, practicing proper switchology and radio commentary. Tasks are
  performed independent of actual or briefed threat capabilities and weapons, and
  environmental considerations. These intercepts will not update ACBT currency. One event
  may be logged per engagement.
