SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been reviewed IAW AFI 21-101 para. 8.3.4. Minor changes were made
throughout the publication to update the reference from FCF to CF/HSTCs. Additional
 2                                                          314AWI21-102 8 FEBRUARY 2013


formatting changes were made to paragraph 7. This publication supersedes 314 AWI 21-102, 04
November 2009.
1. Functional Check Flight (FCF). FCFs to include check flights (CF), functional check
flights (FCF), operational check flights (OCF), high speed taxi checks (HSTC) are performed to
ensure aircraft are safe for flight and capable of performing assigned missions. However, CFs
are not flown when the airworthiness of the aircraft can be determined by maintenance
operational checks prescribed by a technical directive.
2. Maintenance Responsibilities. The aircraft maintenance unit will ensure the following steps
are completed:
     2.1. Ensure all aircraft systems are fully operational or that known discrepancies will not
     affect the CF profile.
     2.2. Coordinate fuel load and cargo compartment configuration requirements then
     refuel/configure the aircraft according to aircrew request. To minimize brake and tire wear
     while performing HSTC, coordinate with the FCF aircrew to ensure the aircraft is configured
     with the minimum operational fuel requirements. Ensure aircraft is prepared for flight and the
     Exceptional/Conditional release is signed off.
     2.3. Prepare aircraft AFTO Form 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, series binder
     for review by QA. Ensure all AFTO Forms 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
     Document, since last flight, to include the original discrepancy, are delivered to QA for
     review no later than 3 hours prior to aircrew briefing on the day of the CF or HSTC.
3. Quality Assurance Responsibilities. Upon notification of a CF or HSTC requirement, the
following steps will be taken:
     3.1. Review the aircraft forms for maintenance accuracy and completed documentation.
     Prepare a concise statement of the reason for the CF or HSTC to be included in the
     discrepancy block of AFTO Form 781A. Place a blue border around the entire page and
     stamp the top with CF worksheet stamp.
     3.2. Insert the blue-bordered AFTO Form 781A CF worksheet in front of the of the AFTO
     Form 781A note page of the active forms and have the highlighted checklist ready for the
     aircrew briefing.
     3.3. Develop an aircrew briefing checklist specifically for HSTCs IAW T.O. 1-1-300,
     Acceptance/Functional Check Flt and Maintenance Operational Checks.
     3.4. On the day of the CF or HSTC, review all aircraft forms since last flight and verify
     aircraft status by calling the Maintenance Operations Center. Coordinate with the aircraft
     maintenance unit to load a job control number in G081. All CFs will use the following job
     control numbers: 8400-8449 as per LRAFBI 21-107, Job Control Number Assignment.
     3.5. Call applicable flying squadronsâ€™ operations desks to notify the aircrew that the aircraft
     and forms are ready for briefing and determine briefing location.
     3.6. Brief aircrew of the reason for the CF or HSTC and annotate the briefing in the next
     open block on the AF Form 2400, Functional Check Flight, or equivalent, Functional Check
     Flight Log. Ensure the aircrew is briefed on the purpose and extent of the CF/HSTC as well
314AWI21-102 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                3


   as previous maintenance problems and discrepancies recorded on the aircraft or engines
   related to the CF/HSTC.
4. Aircrew Responsibilities. The CF/HSTC will be accomplished using the information
contained in the FCF Information Handbook containing Technical Order (TO) 1-1-300, TO 1C-
130E(H)-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Manual,1C-130E(H)-6CL-1,
Acceptance and or Functional Check Flight Checklist, and 1C-130J-6CF-1, Acceptance or
Functional Check Flight Procedures.
   4.1. The aircraft commander will review the aircraft forms and applicable CF/HSTC TO and
   sign the log sheet to signify he/she has reviewed the FCF Read File. The aircraft commander
   will brief the aircrew on issues concerning the FCF Read File.
   4.2. Enter only CF/HSTC related discrepancies on the blue-bordered AFTO Form 781A.
   Discrepancies not CF/HSTC related are placed in the regular AFTO Forms 781A.
   4.3. The aircraft commander will annotate and complete the appropriate blocks on the
   completed applicable CF/HSTC checklist, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight
   Status and Maintenance Document, and blue-bordered AFTO Form 781A with the time and
   date the CF/HSTC was completed.
5. Off-Station CF/HSTC Procedures:
   5.1. The Temporary Duty (TDY) maintenance personnel will notify home station to verify
   the CF/HSTC requirement.
   5.2. The local (TDY location) QA will review all maintenance actions prior to CF/HSTC. If
   no local QA exists then the TDY maintenance personnel will contact home-station QA for
   guidance and instructions and to review all maintenance actions prior to CF/HSTC.
   5.3. If the Mission Design Series aircraft is not assigned at the transient base, then the
   owning unit must provide a qualified CF/HSTC pilot/crew and maintenance as required.
   5.4. The TDY maintenance personnel will contact the transient base flight operations unit
   and home-station to determine CF/HSTC pilot/crew availability/scheduling.
6. CF/HSTC Attempt/Release: The following steps will be accomplished:
   6.1. Upon completion of each CF/HSTC attempt/release, the QA technician will debrief the
   aircrew at the applicable maintenance debrief section and retrieve the applicable CF/HSTC
   checklist. The QA technician will sign off the CF/HSTC in G081 using his/her employee
   number for the aircrew.
   6.2. When the CF/HSTC aircraft is released, QA will complete all documentation on the AF
   Form 2400 or equivalent; or a computer automated FCF Log as required.
   6.3. QA will move the blue-bordered page from in front the AFTO Forms 781A to the last
   page and re-number it accordingly. QA will deliver the CF/HSTC completed checklist to the
   314th Maintenance Operations Flight Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation section to be
   filed in the aircraft jacket file.
   6.4. If the aircraft fails the CF/HSTC and is not released, QA will move the blue-bordered
   page from in front the AFTO Forms 781A to the last page and re-number it accordingly.
