1. Definitions
     1.1. Programming Plan (PPlan). A directive, coordinated document, consisting of a Basic
     Plan and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required, and outlines
     the responsibilities for achieving a given program objective. The primary types of actions for
     which PPlans are developed include: unit activations and inactivations; realignments
     involving the physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of weapons
     systems; unit conversions from one weapons system to another; beddown and/or integration
     of specialized systems or unique organizational constructs; and increases or decreases in a
     unit's Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI). The gaining MAJCOM is responsible for writing
     each PPlan.
     1.2. Programming Message (PMsg). A PMsg may be used in lieu of a PPlan when less
     comprehensive documentation will suffice to implement a program objective. For example, a
     PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action.
     A PMsg may also be used as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide
     basic guidance pertaining to a major program action while more comprehensive
     documentation is being developed. This is the method of choice when planning time is
     limited. See Attachment 3, Table A3.1 for further details.
     1.3. Documented Approval Authority. PPlans/PMsgs require documented approval
     authority. Following are the primary vehicles accepted as documented approval authority for
     developing a PPlan or a PMsg.
        1.3.1. Program Change Request (PCR). A PCR is a tool, submitted by a MAJCOM or
        the Air Staff, which is used to initiate proposed out-of-cycle changes to programs
        contained in the President's Budget (PB). Air Force program actions are authorized by the
        PB. Formulation of the PB is a cyclic process. HQ PACAF/A8P is the command OPR for
        most PCRs. However, depending on subject matter, other PACAF staff agencies may
PACAFI 10-501 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  3


     have occasion to develop PCRs. See AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air
     Force Programs, for additional guidance.
     1.3.2. Program Action Directive (PAD). PADs are generated at the Air Staff level and
     are used to direct MAJCOM development of PPlans/PMsgs for program actions already
     in the PB or which are to be worked into the PB through standard processes. In some
     instances, a MAJCOM may request authority to write a PAD or be directed to write a
     PAD by Air Staff, but this is the exception rather than the rule. See Air Force Instruction
     10-501, Program Action Directives and Programming Plans, for further guidance
     regarding PADs.
     1.3.3. Organizational Change Request (OCR). An OCR is a request for an organizational
     action such as a unit activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard
     structure. An OCR is not required for organizational changes resulting from approved
     force structure actions.
     1.3.4. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). The process under Public Law (PL) 100-
     526 and 101-510 that the DoD has used to reorganize its installation infrastructure to
     more efficiently and effectively support its force structure, increase operational readiness,
     and facilitate new ways of doing business through closure and/or realignment of military
     installations. MAJCOMs develop PPlans to implement approved BRAC actions although
     they are not part of the AF Strategic Basing process. The HQ PACAF proponent for
     BRAC-directed actions is HQ PACAF A5/8. See AFI 10-503, Chapter 1 for more
     information.
  1.4. Site Survey. An AF/A8PB authorized, MAJCOM action team visit to a particular
  location with the purpose to determine feasibility for a unit or mission beddown. The Site
  Survey may be used as a tool in the decision-making process for a proposed program change,
  or may be conducted to facilitate planning for a pre-determined program change. The gaining
  MAJCOM is the lead for each Site Survey. The HQ PACAF office of primary responsibility
  for Site Surveys is HQ PACAF/A8PB. See Site Survey approval process in AFI 10-503,
  Chap 3.
  1.5. Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA). Air Force Form 813,
  Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, initiates the required analytical assessment of
  environmental impacts associated with proposed program actions as mandated by the
  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-190) and Title 32 CFR Part
  989¸the Environmental Impact Process. Air Force Form 813 contains two main elements: the
  Purpose and Need for the Action and the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives
  (DOPAA). AF Form 813 (often referred to as "the DOPAA") identifies the need for the
  proposed action, defines the scope of the action, discusses reasonable alternatives, and helps
  in determining the appropriate level of environmental analysis required. The HQ PACAF
  focal point for DOPAA development associated with force structure and organizational
  changes is HQ PACAF/A7.
  1.6. Site Action Task Force (SATAF):
     1.6.1. The SATAF process provides periodic, on-scene assistance to unit-level agencies
     to accomplish a program objective. It employs a team of MAJCOM functional experts
     chartered to travel to an installation to identify all actions necessary to ensure a beddown
4                                                        PACAFI 10-501 19 FEBRUARY 2014


       or other basing action at that installation is successful. The gaining MAJCOM is the lead
       for each SATAF. For PACAF, appropriate members of the HQ PACAF and/or
       supporting command staffs, under the leadership of HQ PACAF/A8PB make up the
       SATAF team. The SATAF is also comprised of members from the affected unit(s), which
       are organized into functional working groups. Each working group has an assigned
       chairperson, who functions under the auspices of the SATAF Team Chief.
       1.6.2. A SATAF may be convened to support bringing a program, system, equipment
       and/or site to operational readiness. SATAFs are also conducted to facilitate unit
       activations, inactivations, deactivations, relocations, and conversions from one weapons
       system to another. Additionally, SATAFs are conducted for PACAF actions directed by
       BRAC. SATAFs for other types of actions occasionally occur and are conducted by the
       office responsible for the primary subject matter, if the subject is not strategic basing.
       PACAF/A8PB will issue the PPlan numbers for all PPlans regardless of subject.
       1.6.3. Whenever possible, documentation resulting from the SATAF process is
       incorporated into its respective PPlan. The documentation is comprised of minutes for
       each functional working group, action items and milestones identified by each working
       group, and an executive summary.
       1.6.4. Each action item and functional area is graded according to the following program
       assessment criteria: GREEN - program or action on track; objective and timing
       attainable; YELLOW - high-risk workarounds and/or insufficient information available
       for program assessment; RED - program or action objective will not be attained and/or
       prescribed timelines will not be met.
    1.7. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). A designated staff office or field-level agency
    that is responsible for a particular aspect of a PPlan or PMsg (i.e., functional annex OPR,
    action item OPR, milestone OPR, etc.).
    1.8. Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR). A designated staff office or field-level
    agency whose input is required to facilitate an OPR's accomplishment of a particular PPlan
    or PMsg related responsibility.
    1.9. Proponent. The office, unit, or activity, at any level, that initiates an Air Force basing
    action.
    1.10. PPlan Manager. A PPlan Manager is the individual appointed within HQ
    PACAF/A8PB to provide “cradle-to-grave” administrative oversight for a program action
    that requires a PPlan or PMsg. See Chapter 3 for information pertaining to the specific duties
    of PPlan Managers.
    1.11. Functional Area Manager. A Functional Area Manager is the focal point within an HQ
    PACAF staff agency tasked to provide key input to and/or track a PPlan or PMsg for that
    respective functional area. See Chapter 3 for information pertaining to the specific duties of
    Functional Area Managers.
    1.12. Unit Program Manager. Individual appointed by the unit commander to serve as the
    unit-level point of contact for implementation of a PPlan/PMsg. Specific duties of the Unit
    Program Manager will be spelled out in the applicable PPlan/PMsg.
PACAFI 10-501 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 5


   1.13. Milestones. Key events identified in the PPlan/PMsg which are essential to
   accomplishment of the programmed objective as scheduled.
   1.14. Action Items. Actions which must be initiated and completed at a specific time to
   support PPlan implementation. Action items which are critical to a particular milestone or
   milestones are identified as such within each PPlan.
   1.15. Critical Action. Action that must be completed/closed to achieve an associated
   milestone.
   1.16. Program Management System (PMS). Reporting associated with the implementation
   of PACAF PPlans is accomplished through the PMS, an electronic, web-based tracking
   system. See Attachment 4 for details on reporting and the use of PMS.
2. Policy
   2.1. Programming Plan Authority:
       2.1.1. The HQ PACAF Director of Strategy, Plans & Programs (HQ PACAF/A5/8) is the
       sole approval and release authority for PACAF PPlans and PMsgs.
       2.1.2. The PPlan/PMsg function resides within the Bases and Units Branch (HQ
       PACAF/A8PB). When a PPlan/PMsg requirement arises, HQ PACAF/A8PB will assign
       a PPlan/PMsg control number, establish the appropriate vehicle (PPlan or PMsg), and
       develop the finalized product for basing actions, only. See Chapter 3 for further details.
            2.1.2.1. As the command focal point for PPlans/PMsgs, HQ PACAF/A8PB is
            responsible for managing the associated Site Action Task Force (SATAF) process.
            See Chapter 3 for further details.
            2.1.2.2. HQ PACAF/A8PB is responsible for managing the PACAF PMS, an
            automated data base application used to track the implementation status of PACAF
            basing PPlans/PMsgs. In this capacity, HQ PACAF/A8PB controls system use and
            user support. See Attachment 4 for further details.
   2.2. PPlan/PMsg Development for non-basing actions:
       2.2.1. It is important to note that the PPlan is only one element in the overall planning
       process. Organizations may use the PPlan construct to accomplish non-basing actions.
       2.2.2. Requests for PPlan/PMsg number issuance will be submitted to HQ PACAF/A8P.
   2.3. Command Relationship: PACAF PPlans/PMsgs are directive upon the HQ PACAF staff
   and agencies subordinate to this headquarters. PACAF PPlans/PMsgs will not task higher-
   echelon agencies or non-PACAF agencies.
   2.4. Unit PPlans and NAF PPlans: PACAF units/NAFs may develop plans or supplements
   whenever the need to manage programming actions of any type, at the unit/NAF level, exists.
   Guidance/tasking contained in unit/NAF plans/supplements will neither supersede nor
   interfere with the guidance/tasking contained in any HQ PACAF PPlan. Unit/NAF PPlans
   will not task higher-echelon agencies or non-PACAF agencies. PPlan samples and templates,
   and sample PMsgs, can be obtained by contacting HQ PACAF/A8PB or can be found in
   Attachment 2 Tables A2.1. - A2.8.
   2.5. Joint Command PPlans.
6                                                      PACAFI 10-501 19 FEBRUARY 2014


       2.5.1. When a program action requires a joint-command PPlan/PMsg, tasking of
       agencies belonging to the other affected command is at the discretion of that command.
       PACAF will task its own agencies.
       2.5.2. When PACAF is the lead command for a joint command PPlan/PMsg, all
       guidance contained in this instruction will apply. When another command has the lead,
       guidance contained in that command's respective governing publication will apply. In all
       cases, actions for which PACAF is responsible will be tracked through the PMS or
       similar reporting systems designated by PACAF/A8PB.
       2.5.3. Normally, when assets are to be transferred from one command to the other, if a
       PPlan is required, the gaining command will serve as the lead command for PPlan
       development.
    2.6. Staff Support of PACAF PPlans/PMsgs:
       2.6.1. PPlan Functional OPRs.
          2.6.1.1. The staff agencies designated as the OPR for PPlans/PMsgs within their
          functional area will provide a point of contact to serve as the Functional Area
          Manager for each PPlan/PMsg tasking requirement. Specific Functional Area
          Manager responsibilities are outlined in Chapter 3.
          2.6.1.2. Overarching responsibility for reporting on the status of PPlan/PMsg
          milestone and action item tasking levied against HQ PACAF staff agencies rests with
          the designated OPR for PPlans within each functional area, through the assigned
          Functional Area Manager for each PPlan/PMsg. Thus, PPlan functional OPRs will
          ensure the establishment of internal administrative procedures to support the PMS
          reporting process within their directorate. HQ PACAF/A8PB will provide guidance,
          as necessary, to support this policy. See Attachment 4 for more information on
          reporting and the PMS.
    2.7. PPlan/PMsg Development Process.
       2.7.1. PPlans/PMsgs are developed to support the implementation of a variety of
       program actions. Each action must be approved by appropriate authority, and the
       approval must be documented.
       2.7.2. Development of the basing PPlan or PMsg is only one element in the overall
       planning process. The following information is provided to facilitate an understanding of
       where the PPlan/PMsg fits into the process and the importance of initiating the process in
       a timely manner.
          2.7.2.1. Step 1: Site Survey. Most basing actions actually begin with a request for a
          Site Survey (definition at para 1.4). AF/A8PB is the approval authority for a Site
          Survey and will issue a Site Survey Control Number upon approval. See AFI 10-503,
          Strategic Basing, for a description of the approval process.
          2.7.2.2. Step 2: Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The EIAP begins
          with the generation of a DOPAA (definition at para 1.5). Although the DOPAA can
          generally be completed within a month or two, completion of the associated EIAP can
          take as long as one year, depending on the program action. Early identification of
          program action requirements is highly recommended, not only to facilitate the EIAP,
PACAFI 10-501 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               7


         but also for programming outyear funding requirements. Note that although a PPlan
         or PMsg can be initiated or published prior to completion of the EIAP, and some
         supporting actions can be accomplished, no irreversible actions can take place until
         the EIAP is complete (no movement of assets; i.e., people, aircraft, etc.).
         2.7.2.3. Step 3A, If Applicable: Program Change Request (PCR). For force structure
         program actions, if the action is not already included in the President's Budget or
         being worked into the budget through the standard programming process, a PCR must
         be generated (definition at para 1.3). It can take as long as six months, or more in
         some cases, to draft, coordinate, and obtain approval of a PCR. PPlan/PMsg
         development can begin prior to PCR approval, but no irreversible actions may be
         taken until approval is granted. HQ PACAF/A8P is the command OPR for most
         PCRs. However, depending on subject matter, other PACAF staff agencies may have
         occasion to develop PCRs. Refer to AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air
         Force Programs, for additional guidance.
         2.7.2.4. Step 3B, If Applicable: Organizational Change Request (OCR). If the
         program action involves an organizational change that is not already reflected in the
         President's Budget, an OCR must be submitted to Air Staff, through HQ
         PACAF/A1M (see definition of OCR under para 1.3). An OCR takes approximately
         180 days for Air Staff approval. PPlan/PMsg development can begin prior to OCR
         approval, but no irreversible actions can be taken until approval is granted. Send
         completed OCRs to HQ PACAF/A1M following instructions in AFI 38-101, Air
         Force Organization.
         2.7.2.5. Step 4: Site Action Task Force (SATAF). Conduct a SATAF, if required.
         HQ PACF/A8PB will determine if a SATAF is needed. SATAF is defined under para
         1.6 Documentation from the SATAF will be incorporated into its respective PPlan. It
         generally takes anywhere from three to four months to complete the combined
         PPlan/SATAF portion of the planning process and to publish the documentation.
         Refer to Chapter 3 for further information on PPlan development and SATAFs.
         2.7.2.6. Step 5: Complete the basic PPlan or PMsg. Once approval authority has been
         confirmed and steps 1-3 above have been initiated, HQ PACAF/A8PB will
         accomplish the basic PPlan/PMsg for basing actions.
  2.8. Signatures on PPlans. To support the electronic processing of PPlans, signatures are not
  required on the basic plan and functional annexes. However, the basic plan and annexes must
  be annotated as “// SIGNED//” over the signature block of the designated approval authority.
  This policy does NOT negate the requirement for actual approval by the designated authority,
  which should be documented and maintained by each respective PPlan OPR.
  2.9. Electronic Publication of PPlans. HQ PACAF/A8P policy is to publish PPlans/PMsgs
  electronically. Once the PPlan or PMsg has been posted to the PACAF A5/8Web page, A8P
  will issue a notice to all intended recipients to announce publication.
     2.9.1. PPlans/PMsgs which are UNCLASSIFIED or FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
     (FOUO) will be posted on the PACAF A5/8 Web page. Click “Sections” from the top left
     side of the screen, then select “A8P – Programming Division” on the drop down menu.

        On the left hand column you will see a section called “Sites”, click on the “A8PB” link.
        Click on “A8PB Active Projects” on left side, then navigate folders to find desired file.

                                REPORTING PROCEDURES

A4.1. The Program Management System (PMS). Reporting associated with the
implementation of PPlans/PMsgs is normally accomplished through the Program Management
System (PMS). The exception is in AF-wide beddowns where contractor-developed tracking
systems are usually used. To access the PMS, visit the following address on the Internet:
https://application.eim.acc.af.mil/apps/pms/PACAF_PMS/default.aspx. Authorized access is
required to log into the PMS for reporting purposes (although no authorized access is required to
simply view PPlan data as a “user”). Contact the PACAF PMS administrator at HQ
PACAF/A8PB, DSN 449-0773 (E-mail pacaf.a8pb@us.af.mil) to obtain access.
   A4.1.1. Monthly Update Cycle: Updates on milestones and action items can be made at any
   time. This policy is spelled out within each PPlan/PMsg. Reporting agencies are strongly
   encouraged to update items within their area of responsibility as soon as possible after each
   milestone and action item is accomplished so the status of each PPlan/PMsg reflects real-
   time data to the greatest extent possible.
   A4.1.2. Directions on the use of the PMS are found via the link referenced in paragraph 4.1
   or via the PACAF A8PB web page. This page can be accessed through the PACAF A5/8
   Web page. Click “Sections” from the top left side of the screen, then select “A8P –
   Programming Division” on the drop down menu. On the left hand column you will see a
   section called “Sites”, click on the “A8PB” link. Click on “A8PB Active Projects” on left
   side, then navigate folders to find the PMS file.
A4.2. PPlan Manager Reporting Responsibilities: (Also see para 3.6)
   A4.2.1. The PPlan Manager will provide updates, in accordance with the prescribed
   reporting due date criteria set forth in the PPlan/PMsg, regarding the progress made towards
   meeting the program objective(s). This will be accomplished using the PMS and will entail
   providing an overall assessment of program status using the Red-Yellow-Green scale
   outlined under para 1.6.4. Follow the guidance under para A4.1.2 to find the applicable
   PPlan/ PMsg within the PMS.
A4.3. Functional Area Manager Reporting Responsibilities. Assigned HQ PACAF
Functional Area Managers are listed in each respective PPlan/PMsg. These individuals will
report on the status of actions within their area of responsibility in accordance with the due
date/submission criteria set forth in the PPlan/PMsg and the following guidance. Functional Area
Managers should also review para 3.9
   A4.3.1. HQ PACAF Functional Area Managers are responsible for reporting on all program
   milestones and action items within their functional area to the PPlan Manager. Thus, each
   Functional Area Manager is responsible for establishing internal reporting procedures within
   his/her functional area.
   A4.3.2. Use Table A4.1. for an action item prefix guide:
