This Instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-8, Employee Benefits and
Entitlements and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-807, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and
Holiday Observances by providing guidance and procedures supervisors need to schedule
civilian, non-bargaining unit employees for work. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form
(AF Form) 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form’s 847 from the
field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change eliminates the need for employees on Gliding work schedule to receive supervisory
approval to earn credit hours. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Form 270, AFRC Timecard
Worksheet will be used to record starting and stop times and eliminates the need for a Gliding
Schedule Log. There is clarification concerning earning credit hours for missed lunch periods
and earning compensatory time off for travel. There is no longer a primary regular day off and
primary 8-hour day for employees under the compressed work schedule.

1. Scope and Applicability. This instruction applies to all appropriated fund non-bargaining
unit civilian employees assigned to 452 Air Mobility Wing (AMW) units.
2. Hours of Operation. The normal hours of operation for the 452d AMW are 0730 to 1630,
Monday through Friday. Supervisors ensure adequate coverage of their functional areas during
these hours, including lunch periods.
3. Tours of Duty. Personnel not on a flexible work schedule, compressed work schedule, shift
work or special work schedules coordinated/documented with their supervisors will adhere to a
regular tour of duty. A regular tour of duty consists of five 8-hour days, Monday through Friday,
with a minimum 30-minute lunch period. The Wing Commander must approve exceptions.
    3.1. It is contrary to AFRC policy to change a tour of duty (regular, flexible or compressed)
    to avoid taking leave for military duty. Only employees assigned to gliding flexible
    schedules may make such adjustments.
4. Flexible Work Schedule (FWS):
    4.1. Organization commanders have the authority to approve/disapprove the use of a flexible
    work schedule by non-bargaining unit employees in their organization. A flexible work
    schedule should result in a positive impact on productivity, employee job satisfaction and
    incidental leave usage and maintain, if not increase, the support to our customers. A flexible
    work schedule does not provide for a regular day off each week or pay period.
       4.1.1. Flexitour: The flexitour workday is eight (8) hours between 0600 and 1800, plus a
       lunch period between 1100 and 1300, with all employees on duty during the core hours of
       0900 – 1500 unless on leave. A fixed arrival time is established for each employee
       between 0600 and 0900.        The lunch period must be at least 30 minutes in duration.
       Although there is no flexibility in start/stop times (all deviations in start and stop times
       must be accounted for by using credit hours, compensatory time off or leave), employees
       may temporarily alter starting, stopping and lunch times during the pay period with
       advance notice and supervisory approval to meet mission requirements (not to avoid
       taking leave for military duty).
       4.1.2. Employees may request a change to their fixed arrival, departure and/or lunch
       times for the subsequent pay period by submitting a Work Schedule Change Form to their
       supervisor for approval by the last Wednesday of the preceding pay period.
       4.1.3. Gliding: The gliding schedule workday is eight (8) hours between 0600 and 1800,
       plus a lunch period between 1100 and 1300. All employees are on duty during the core
       hours of 0900 – 1500 unless on leave. The lunch period must be at least 30 minutes in
       duration. Employees may alter starting and stopping times within the flexible time bands
       (0600-0900 and 1500-1800) without prior supervisory approval. Employees are
       responsible for scheduling their work to meet mission/customer requirements.
       Employees must record the start and stop times each day on AFRC Form 270, AFRC
       Timecard Worksheet.
    4.2. Credit hours are hours that an employee elects to work in excess of the basic work
    requirement under flexitour or gliding schedule.
       4.2.1. Credit hours may be earned only within an employee’s flexible work schedule.
       This means that an employee may earn credit hours only by working within the flexible
452AMWI36-402 3 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   3


      time bands of 0600 and the start of the normal tour and between the end of the normal
      tour and 1800, all hours between 0600 and 1800 on weekends, or as otherwise approved
      by the supervisor (before 0600 or after 1800). Credit hours can be earned for an
      occasional missed lunch period, but it is improper to routinely earn credit hours for
      missing part or all of the lunch period.
      4.2.2. Credit hours may be used on the day earned or during a subsequent day, week or
      pay period with supervisory approval, to allow the employee to be absent from an equal
      number of hours of the employee’s basic work requirement with no loss of basic pay.
      4.2.3. Credit hours are worked voluntarily by employees in excess of their fixed duty
      hours. Only one credit hour is earned for each hour of voluntary work in excess of the
      basic work requirement.
      4.2.4. Credit hours are worked at the election of the employee. They are distinguished
      from overtime hours in that they are not officially ordered and approved in advance by
      management.
      4.2.5. There is no limit to the amount of credit hours that an employee may earn during a
      pay period; however, only 24 credit hours may be carried into the next pay period.
      Therefore, credit hours earned in excess of 24 must be used during the pay period in
      which earned or they will be forfeited. Carry-over credit hours are retained indefinitely
      until used.
      4.2.6. Credit hours will be earned and used in quarter hour increments only.
   4.3. Employees relieved from working on a day designated as a holiday are entitled to their
   rate of basic pay on that day for a maximum of eight (8) hours.
   4.4. Overtime hours. Overtime hours are all hours in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours
   in a week that are officially ordered and approved in advance, but do not include credit hours.
   4.5. Record Keeping: Employees on flexible work schedule will use the AFRC Timecard to
   record start/stop times (for gliding schedule), credit hours earned and credit hours used.
5. Compressed Work Schedule (CWS):
   5.1. Employees may work eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day for a total of 80 hours in a
   pay period in lieu of a flexible or regular tour of duty. The CWS is a fixed schedule which
   does not allow for flexibility in reporting or quitting times.
   5.2. The CWS workday consists of work hours between 0600 and 1800. Fixed arrival,
   departure and lunch times are established for each employee. Arrival times are between
   0600 and 0800, departure times between 1500 and 1800 and lunch between 1100 and 1300.
   The lunch period must be at least 30 minutes and no more than 60 minutes in duration.
   5.3. The supervisor will determine a fixed regular day off (RDO) and 8-hour day which
   provides for office coverage or other mission requirements. The RDO and 8-hour day shall
   not be frequently adjusted for personal reasons.
   5.4. There is no legal authority for credit hours under CWS. Flexible and compressed work
   schedules cannot be combined.

6. Temporary Duty (TDY). When an employee covered by CWS or FWS is TDY, the
employee will normally switch to a traditional fixed schedule (8 hours a day, 40 hours a week)
during pay periods employee is TDY to conform to operations at the temporary work site.
7. Compensatory Time Off for Travel. Employees are entitled to compensatory time off for
time spent in a travel status away from the employee’s official duty station when such time is not
otherwise compensable.
    7.1. Travel status includes only the time actually spent traveling between the official duty
    station and a temporary duty station, or between two temporary duty stations, and the usual
    waiting time (no more than 1½ hours may be credited before scheduled departure of
    domestic flights and no more than 3 hours before departure of international flights) that
    precedes or interrupts such travel. NOTE: Ontario/Los Angeles International Airport (ONT)
    is within the official duty station of March Air Reserve Base (ARB). As a result,
    commuting time to and from ONT cannot be credited as compensatory time for travel,
    regardless of whether the commute is longer or shorter than the normal commute to March
    ARB. Compensatory time for travel begins upon arrival at ONT and ends when the traveler
    departs ONT for home.
    7.2. Employees must file requests for credit of compensatory time off for travel within 5
    workdays after returning to the official duty station, or within 5 workdays of returning from
    TDY or approved leave which immediately follows the TDY during which the compensatory
    time off for travel was earned, by submitting a travel itinerary, or any other documentation
    which supports the request. If not submitted within 5 workdays, the employee shall forfeit
    his or her claim to the compensatory time off for travel. Compensatory time off for travel
    shall be credited in increments of one-quarter of an hour (15 minutes).
    7.3. An employee must use the accrued compensatory time off for travel by the end of the
    26th pay period after the pay period in which it was earned or the employee must forfeit the
    compensatory time off.
