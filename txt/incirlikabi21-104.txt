Programs, collectively known as FOD/DOP Programs for Incirlik Air Base. This instruction
applies to all squadrons, units, detachments, temporary duty organizations, contractors and
personnel who work in, on, around, or travel through areas near aircraft, AGE, engines or
components thereof. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

These changes clarify responsibilities of each unit. The duplication of requirements in MXGOI
21-101 and IABI 21-104 have been removed in order to reduce confusion and increase
standardization. Additionally, the 39th Air Base Wing FOD Recognition Program has been
removed and is now an optional squadron level program.

   clearly labeled with the date, time and location of the discovery. If volume exceeds the
   finder’s removal capability, notify 39th Operations Squadron Airfield Management (39
   OS/OSAB) and request for sweeper to be dispatched immediately to clean the area.

   and pick up any debris or objects that may cause FOD (hardware, trash, etc.).

     possible. One is assigned to 39th Maintenance Squadron Transient Alert (39 MXS/MXMT)
     and the other is assigned to 39th Maintenance Squadron AGE Flight (39 MXS/MXMG).
        4.6.1. 39 MXS/MXMT is responsible for operating a FOD Boss on the flightline south of
        the runway, three times a week. Areas of responsibility include Alpha Ramp, Charlie
        Ramp and South Parallel Taxiway in between.
        4.6.2. 39 MXS/MXMG is responsible for operating a FOD Boss on the flightline north
        of the runway, three times a week. Areas of responsibility include AGE hardstand and
        North Parallel Taxiway from G-83 gate to hardstand 15. 39 MXS/MXMG may

5. Vehicle Operator/Vehicle FOD Prevention Requirements.
     5.1. Be familiar with Incirlik Air Base Instruction (IABI) 13-201, Airfield Driving Program,
     and adhere to all airfield signs and notifications. Perform vehicle/tire FOD checks wherever
     specified or appropriate.
     5.2. All vehicles that access the flightline will be free of litter, rocks or other debris. Litter,
     rocks and other debris will be removed from tires, engine compartments and the
     interior/exterior of the vehicle prior to entering the flightline. All vehicles accessing the
     flightline are subject to FOD checks.
        5.2.1. Additional equipment assigned to vehicles (i.e. flashlights, extension cords, etc.)
        will be annotated on the vehicle inspection form.
     5.3. Personnel will stop and perform roll-over FOD checks on all vehicle and equipment
     tires when entering all FOD checkpoints.
        5.3.1. Personnel will adhere to all airfield signs and notifications; complete a “Roll-
        Over” FOD check prior to entering the aircraft movement areas and in designated areas.
        During FOD checks, the vehicle must be secured from the possibility of inadvertent
        movement. If one individual remains behind the wheel during FOD checks, the engine
        may be left running with the vehicle in “park” (automatic transmissions) or “neutral”
        (manual transmissions) and the parking/emergency brake set. If there is no one available
        to sit behind the wheel during FOD checks, the engine must be turned “off” and the
        parking/emergency brake set. Automatic transmissions will be placed in “park”.
        Vehicles will be checked by the driver and/or vehicle occupants for FOD in the tire
        treads. For a roll-over FOD Check, all portions of vehicle tires must be carefully
        inspected by pulling forward (approx ½ tire rotation) after initial check of visible tire area
        to inspect remaining tire area.

         forced to depart the paved surface for any reason, another complete roll-over FOD
         check must be performed before entering the flightline. Vehicles that cross double
         yellow lines or otherwise drive on shoulders (asphalt) must re-accomplish a FOD
         check before proceeding back onto runway or taxiway concrete.
         5.3.1.2. Personnel will review IABI 13-202, Chapter 9 for FOD check point
         procedures in the loops.
  5.4. All government owned, leased or rental vehicles supporting flightline operations must
  have a FOD container. The unit’s vehicle control officer will determine the type and size of
  FOD container to use. All FOD containers must be secured to the vehicle, have a closable lid
  and “FOD” stenciled in a contrasting color, no smaller than 2-inch letters. The FOD
  container must be annotated on the vehicle inspection form.
     5.4.1. Vehicle operators are responsible for monitoring and emptying the FOD container
     after each work shift.
  5.5. For vehicles that routinely access the flightline, operators must ensure the vehicle has a
  locally manufactured or procured tool attached to the vehicle key ring for removing debris
  from the tire tread.
