for selecting the 94th Airlift Wing (94 AW) Airman (AMN), Noncommissioned Officer (NCO), Senior
Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO), and Company Grade Officer (CGO) of the Quarter and Year, and the

contributions toward accomplishing the mission of the United States Air Force and the 94 AW and who
have shown responsible citizenship in their respective communities. Refer to Department of Defense
(DoD) Manual 1348.33-M, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards, for the basis and description of

Decoration Program, for guidance on how to prepare, submit, process and record federal decorations and
awards. Refer to AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, for guidance on how to prepare and submit
USAF special trophy and award nominations. 94 MSS/DPM must review all supplements to this instruc-
tion. This applies to all members assigned and attached to the 94th Airlift Wing, Air Reserve Base.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

company grade officer (CGO) of the quarter and year program and a structured board scoring system to
include standardized scoring sheets for enlisted and officer programs. It also significantly changes the
award nomination formats for enlisted categories and implements them for CGO awards.
