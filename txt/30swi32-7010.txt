SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The revision of this publication is to update office names, procedures, and types of approvals that have
changed since the previous 18 August 1998 edition. The publication number reflects the series number.
Some minor editing has also been done. No content material or process has changed except that 30
MSG approval is no longer required for temporary siting requirements (paragraph 5.4.); that approval is
at the 30 CES Engineering or Operations Flight Chief level (paragraph 5.4.), and the Facilities Board
(FB) only approves siting for major construction and land use designation that differs from the current
General Plan (paragraph 1.1.).

3. New Programs Beddowns.
   3.1. The Program Requirement Division (30 SW/XPR), 1515 Iceland Ave, Bldg 8500, Suite 1,
   Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437-5244, serves as the initial point of contact for all government and/or
   new commercial entities requesting use of Vandenberg AFB and will relay all siting requests to 30
   CES/CECB on behalf of the requesting party during the Site Survey process, along with a program
   summary and statement that the 30 SW supports the proposed request per the Base Unit Beddown
   Program, AFI 10-503. The request will also identify potential base or range support requirements
   and will be relayed to the Base Planning Office (30 CES/CECB), 1172 Iceland Avenue, Bldg 11433,
   Vandenberg AFB CA 93437-6011, for all new programs and or facilities. The summary shall
   include a brief description of each program, along with an estimate as to when and for how long base
   support is required. If base support involves administrative and/or technical space, real property or
   facilities, the recommended locations should be included.
   3.2. When an entity requests to construct a new facility in support of a proposed new program, or an
   existing program assigned to Programs Requirement Division (30 SW/XPR), the Base Planning
   Office (30 CES/CECB) will be contacted by 30 SW/XPR via Site Survey invitation to evaluate
   commercial program requirements. The objective of this initial interaction is to establish a common
   understanding of the userâ€™s basic support requirements and how they can be met with 30 SW's
   capabilities without adversely impacting other current and projected Vandenberg AFB missions.
   3.3. If at any time project scope or requirements change from what was on an original siting request
   letter, 30 SW/XPR will initiate a revised siting request to 30 CES/CECB.
   3.4. Siting requests should, when possible, identify a prioritized list of candidate sites on
   Vandenberg AFB. 30 CES/CECB will coordinate the siting request with appropriate base agencies
   for concurrence and approvals (see Para. 6).
   3.5. All new programs/facility requirements will be coordinated through Environmental Planning
   (30 CES/CEVP) for applicability of an AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Analysis, and the
   Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) via the Site Survey process.
   3.6. In addition, all new programs/facility requirements will have coordination through 30th Space
   Communications Squadron (30 SCS/CD) to ensure communications requirements are addressed via
   the Site Survey process.
4. Facilities Board Approval.
   4.1. The Base Planning Office (30 CES/CECB) will address the Facilities Board bi-annually for all
   major construction sitings and land use changes that deviate from the current approved General Plan.
   4.2. Siting Definitions:
      4.2.1. Temporary Siting: Time based approval ranging from 90 days to 3 years exclusively for
      temporary type projects. A temporarily approved project is to be concluded or relocated off-base
      prior to the siting end date.
4                                                                          30SWI32-7010 8 MAY 2009


       4.2.2. Formal Siting: Final, official approval of a project or site use. Approval is based upon all
       outstanding siting issues having been addressed. Formal Siting is valid for 36 months. If in this
       period the project is not established on Vandenberg AFB, the site approval will need to be
       resubmitted for approval.
       4.2.3. Modular Structure Siting: Considered any temporary trailer, pre-engineered or
       "component" type constructed facility. Three years temporary siting approval is the maximum
       granted per the planned replacement of the modular facility with a permanent facility. HQ
       SAF/MI approval is required prior to siting any modular structure.
       4.2.4. Base Support/Laydown Area Approval: Granted in support of an awarded government
       contract for length of a projectâ€™s performance period.
5. Requests for Temporary Siting Requiring Base Support and Services.
    5.1. Validation and approval is required for every request for temporary use (in support of an
    awarded government/contractor/tenant contract) of any site on Vandenberg AFB. This includes site
    usage for temporary trailers and containers (those for construction activities), mission support type
    trailers and vaults, material storage/laydown and stockpile areas (short and long term), equipment
    parking, fenced lots, etc.
    5.2. The government project officer (30 CES/CECB) is responsible for monitoring the ongoing
    appearance and boundaries of the laydown/equipment areas. Base support and services approval
    will be suspended or terminated if site approval provisions are not observed during the siting period.
    5.3. The requester is responsible for maintaining the site in accordance with the directions of the
    granting government project officer, including complying with environmental rules according to the
    environmental, safety, and occupational health compliance assessment management plan
    (ESOHCAMP) applied by the base environmental office, 30 CES/CEV. After completion of the
    construction period, removal of all equipment and materials, and restoration of the site to original
    condition, is required at the expense of the requester.
    5.4. Requesters shall submit a AF Form 332 for base support at least 15 calendar days in advance of
    need date. After coordination through environmental, safety, and other offices as required on the AF
    Form 332, it must be signed by the 30 CES Engineering or Operations Flight Chief or their deputies,
    or higher, before approval is granted.

Terms
Component Planâ€”A detailed document comprised of graphics, textual data, and narrative that focuses
on functional areas that support the General Plan and the overall comprehensive planning effort.
Preparation of Component Plans is not specifically required by this instruction. Other installation
programs may require the preparation and maintenance of a Component Plan. Component Plan
information should be incorporated into the General Plan at an appropriate level of detail.
Comprehensive Planâ€”The combination of the General Plan, Component Plans, Special Plans and
Studies, and Maps that document a wide range of information necessary for decision-making. It
encompasses those specific resource documents and processes determined to be essential for planning
and managing an installation's physical assets in support of the mission. The comprehensive plan is the
all-encompassing description of the products, whereas comprehensive planning is the action associated
with the process and implementation.
Comprehensive Planningâ€”The ongoing, iterative, participatory process addressing the full range of
issues affecting or affected by an installation's development. Through this process, goals and objectives
are defined, issues are identified, information is gathered, alternative solutions are developed, and a
sound decision-making process is employed to select a preferred alternative for implementation.
General Planâ€”The document that provides the installation commander and other decision-makers a
condensed picture of an installation's capability to support the mission with its physical assets and
delivery systems. It is a general assessment of the installationâ€™s infrastructure and attributes for the
purpose of gauging development potential.
Mapâ€”A graphic representation, usually on a plane surface, and at an established scale, of natural or
built features on the earth surface, that generally encompasses the installation, surrounding area, and
region. The features are positioned relative to a coordinate reference system. Maps in most cases will be
computer generated. Maps support the General Plan, Component Plans, and Special Plans and Studies.
Special Plans and Studiesâ€”A source of planning information on a functional area required by a
specific Air Force program. Examples include Housing Community Plans, Integrated Natural Resources
Management Plans, Air Quality Studies, and Transportation Studies.
