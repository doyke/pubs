                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

2.1. Fitness Program. Students must participate in a scheduled physical training (PT) program
based on the provisions of AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, guidance from AETC, and the ALP-
IFT syllabus.
   2.1.1. Schedule students for a minimum of three PT sessions each week at times most
   compatible with student training activities. Group (flight, class, etc.) PT, if practical, is
   highly encouraged to build esprit de corps but is not required.
   2.1.2. Students unable to complete PT during the scheduled times must complete it during
   off-duty time. PT during off-duty hours does not violate crew rest.
2.2. End-of-Course Critiques. The 14 OG/CC approves an end-of-course critique program.
The IMSO will determine the critique’s content and medium and manage the program.
Administer the critique within 15 duty days of graduation. Use AETC Form 673, Student
Critique, or a 14 OG/CC-approved equivalent for written critiques. Forward critiques to AFSAT
and A3FP, who will review reports and initiate corrective action as necessary. (AETC Form 673
is prescribed in AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Flying Training Administration and
Management. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
2.3. Commander’s Review (CR) Process:
   2.3.1. Overview. The CR recommends a student’s elimination or retention in ALP-IFT. The
   CR process must be completed within 10 duty days from the date the initiating authority (IA)
   signs the AETC Form 145.

        consideration for follow-on training.
        2.3.4.2. Completes Sections III and V (if applicable) of AETC Form 145 and forwards
        the form with all applicable records to the approving authority (AA) for final review. The
        records include a written summary of the significant facts and specific rationale used in
        arriving at the recommendations.
        2.3.4.3. Terminates or completes the CR when it becomes apparent circumstances
        require convening an investigation into the student’s conduct, or when information
        surfaces that would cause the student to be medically disqualified.
     2.3.5. AA. The 14 OG/CC, or designated representative, is the AA. The AA:
        2.3.5.1. Eliminates or reinstates the student following coordination with AFSAT.
        2.3.5.2. Completes Section IV of AETC Form 145 and annotates any recommendations

                                 MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

3.1. Airsickness Procedures:
   3.1.1. Students must meet course training and syllabus maneuver item file (MIF) standards
   to continue flight training. Grade students against the absolute rating scale, regardless of the
   effect of airsickness. During the first eight sorties, the instructor may change the profile,
   momentarily take control of the aircraft or, if necessary, terminate the mission to help
   students overcome the effects of airsickness. As students progress in training, instructor
   assistance decreases.
   3.1.2. Instructors refer students who experience active airsickness (vomiting) or passive
   airsickness to the IMSO who will refer the student to a flight surgeon, aeromedical examiner,
   or medical technician for examination, counseling, and appropriate treatment as soon as
   practical and before the next flight. Airsickness medication or physiological adaptation with
   the Barany Chair or similar device is prohibited. Document episodes of airsickness on AF
   Form 4293 or a 14 OG/CC-approved equivalent.
   3.1.3. While resolving airsickness problems, students continue the normal syllabus flow,
   including flying.
   3.1.4. Students who become airsick on a post-solo sortie receive an overall grade of
   unsatisfactory (U).
3.2. Manifestation of Apprehension (MOA) Procedures. The IMSO requests a flight
surgeon, aeromedical examiner, or medical technician examination for a student with MOA
symptoms. If no psychological or physical problems are present, the student is deemed medically
qualified for flying duties. The decision to eliminate a student for MOA reasons is an operational
decision based on mission impairment and operational risk management. The 14 STUS/CC
reviews the student’s training record and enters justification for recommending elimination for
MOA.
3.3. Medical Elimination:
   3.3.1. The IA, with the concurrence of the attending flight surgeon, aeromedical examiner,
   or medical technician, makes a recommendation for medical elimination (AETC Form 145).
   The RA recommends whether or not the student should be considered for reinstatement at a
   later date.
   3.3.2. Eliminate students placed in duty not including flying status or its equivalent for more
   than 30 calendar days. The IMSO notifies 14 STUS/CC and AFSAT as soon as the medical
   elimination status becomes probable. Under normal circumstances, students medically
   eliminated return to their country until the medical condition is resolved and the student has
   been cleared through appropriate flight surgeon channels to return to flying.
   3.3.3. If the medical condition is resolved, the 14 OG/CC, in consultation with AFSAT,
   AETC/IA, and SAF/IA, as appropriate, determines where and when to reinstate the student in
   the training program or what action to take (for example, course waiver). Record the 14
   OG/CC’s decision in the student’s training folder on an AF Form 4293 or its 14 OG/CC-
AETCI36-2205V12 8 AUGUST 2012                                                        11


  approved equivalent. Reinstatement documentation is included in the student’s training
  folder.

                     TRAINING FOLDERS AND DOCUMENTATION

4.1. Introduction. Student training folders are for the exclusive use of the student’s civilian
instructor pilot, the IMSO, and the immediate chain of command. Specify procedures in
14 OG/CC guidance.
   4.1.1. All personnel must secure training folders and personal information folders to prevent
   unauthorized access. Information affecting student training that is inappropriate for public
   access or sensitive in nature is documented in this folder. The contractor approved for
   conducting formal training or maintaining training records must keep training folders in a
   secure location. When required, the IMSO and/or 14 STUS/CC maintain personal
   information folders on students to protect information of a personal nature not appropriate for
   the training folder. A student may access only his or her training folder.
   4.1.2. Record each aircraft, academic, and ground training event in the training folder.
4.2. Content. The following items are included in the training folder or TIMS/GTIMS, as
applicable: (Note: Grade sheets may be stored separately from the other folder items. The grade
sheets must be added to the other items when the student’s training folder is closed out.)
   4.2.1. AETC Form 101 (or 14 OG/CC-approved equivalent).
   4.2.2. AF Form 4293 (or 14 OG/CC-approved equivalent).
   4.2.3. Grade sheets.
   4.2.4. AETC Form 6.
   4.2.5. CR process paperwork, including the AETC Form 145.
   4.2.6. Messages (if applicable).
   4.2.7. Student résumé.
   4.2.8. Summary of training.
4.3. Documentation. Use AF Form 4293 (or 14 OG/CC-approved equivalent) to document
student training in the training folders. Instructors and the IMSO provide a concise summary of
the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin each entry with the
date, mission number (if applicable), and reason for the entry. End each entry with the signature,
printed name, grade, and duty title of the instructor making the entry. The student and civilian
FLT/CC initial all AF Form 4293 entries prior to the next syllabus-required event.
Documentation is required for the following:
   4.3.1. Nonpermanent medical disqualification or medical hold.
   4.3.2. Failure of the FAA pilot knowledge test. (Update AETC Form 101, if used.)
   4.3.3. Counseling sessions concerning training progress. Note: Document sessions
   concerning sensitive personal problems on AF IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling.
   The IMSO maintains these forms in the personal information folders. Annotate any
   counseling session conducted in the student’s training folder using an AF Form 4293.
AETCI36-2205V12 8 AUGUST 2012                                                                    13

   4.3.12. Missions graded overall fair (F) or unsatisfactory (U). Use the cause-and-effect
   format to document substandard performance
4.4. Student Training Records Disposition. The Registrar maintains student training records
for 1 year after completion of training. Include student résumés, all grade sheets, waivers, and all
copies of AF Form 4293. Refer to Table 4.1 for training documents distribution, including forms,
records, and reports.
