This instruction implements AFPD 21-4, Engineering Data. It provides policy and procedures for manag-
ing engineering data stored, distributed, and controlled by authorized AFMC Engineering Data Support
Centers (EDSC) or repositories. This instruction applies to all AFMC offices that use, analyze, evaluate,
maintain, modify, purchase, or store engineering data elements. This instruction does not apply to the Air
National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision is the initial publication of AFMCI 21-401, aligning it with AFPD 21-4, and substantially
revising AFMCR 67-26, Logistics Management of Repository Data,. It is limited to policy necessary to
accomplish engineering data storage, distribution, and control across AFMC. All nonpolicy processes and
procedures supporting this policy are contained in AFMCMAN 21-2, Engineering Data Storage, Distri-
bution, and Control.

Section A—Basis and Goals of AFMC Engineering Data Storage, Distribution, and Control

1. Purpose. Ensure EDSCs and EDSC users have adequate guidance and instructions for storing, distrib-
uting, and controlling the release of engineering data.
   1.1. Objectives: Provide reasonable assurance that engineering data storage, distribution, and control:
       1.1.1. Obligations and costs are in compliance with applicable policy.
       1.1.2. Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or
       misappropriation.
       1.1.3. Establishes internal management control procedures to effectively prevent waste, fraud,
       mismanagement, and to encourage timely correction of specific problems.

    1.2. Precepts. The following precepts apply to effective storage, distribution, and control of engineer-
    ing data:
       1.2.1. Engineering data requires specific policies and practices to ensure adequate safeguarding of
       costly and valuable resources.
       1.2.2. Storage, distribution, and control of engineering data in a variety of digital, card, or paper
       forms will be a continuing requirement.
