This publication implements AFPD 51-1, The Judge Advocate General's Corps. It provides
guidance and procedures on the active duty judge advocate accession programs of The Judge
Advocate General’s Corps (TJAGC). It implements the Funded Legal Education Program
(FLEP) (pursuant to DoD Directive 1322.12, Funded Legal Education, April 12, 2004) (certified
current as of April 23, 2007) and the Excess Leave Program (ELP). This instruction also
establishes the programs for direct appointment, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
(AFROTC), recall, and inter-service and intra-service transfer. This instruction applies to all
applications for active duty as a judge advocate in TJAGC. This publication does not apply to
the U.S. Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard. This instruction requires the collection
of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. The authority to collect and maintain the
records prescribed in this instruction is Title 10 United States Code Section 806. Air Force
System of Records Notice F051 AFJA C, Judge Advocate Personnel Records, applies. Each
form and format that is subject to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, and
required by this publication contains a Privacy Act Statement, either incorporated in the body of
the document or in a separate statement accompanying each document. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS), or any updated statement provided by the AF
Records Management office (SAF CIO/A6XA). The staff judge advocate interview report
referenced in paragraphs 2.5, 3.5, 5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3, 10.3, and 11.3 does not constitute a
“collection of information” defined in 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(c), Controlling Paperwork Burdens on
the Public, as identical questions are not posed to each applicant during the staff judge advocate
interviews. Therefore, the staff judge advocate interview report is exempt from licensing in
 2                                                                                         AFI51-101 13 NOVEMBER 2014

                                            Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for the active duty judge
advocate accession programs of The Judge Advocate General’s Corps (TJAGC).
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) recruits and selects officers and officer
   candidates for appointment and designation as judge advocates.
   1.2.2. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) exercises and provides academic program
   management, personnel accountability, control, and administrative support for officers
   selected for the Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP), Excess Leave Program (ELP), and
   the United States Air Force Academy–Excess Leave Program (U-ELP). Cadets selected for
   the Educational Delay Program will be assigned to AFIT only for academic program
   management.
   1.2.3. Wing Staff Judge Advocates (SJAs) play a pivotal role in interviewing TJAGC
   applicants to ensure the right people enter the Corps. At the conclusion of the interview,
   SJAs prepare a detailed, honest, and fully developed written assessment of an applicant’s
   perceived potential.
   1.2.4. The Professional Development Directorate, Office of The Judge Advocate
   General (JAX) provides information to the field regarding TJAGC’s accessions programs,
   hosts and coordinates the accessions boards, and serves as TJAG’s liaison with SJAs.
1.3. Recruiting Program Requirements. Recruiting and accessions form the life-blood of
TJAGC. The number and quality of new attorneys brought on active duty today will shape the
force structure for the next three decades. Active participation in our recruiting and retention
efforts is the responsibility of everyone in the Corps. All judge advocates are recruiters and must
work together to attract quality applicants.
   1.3.1. Law School Visits. JAX assigns recruiting responsibilities for law schools to specific
   legal offices based on geographical proximity. A list of these responsibilities is published on
   the JAX website.
       1.3.1.1. The SJA must ensure that they recruit at all assigned law schools once per
       semester (fall and spring). (T-1). This visit normally occurs as an on-campus interview
       (OCI) coordinated directly with law school career services officers (CSOs). SJAs must
       ensure they schedule OCIs by the law school deadline and input required OCI
       information into the Accessions and Recruiting Management System (ARMS). (T-1). If
       a base SJA is unable to make a required visit, the SJA must contact JAX immediately to
       obtain approval for other recruiting arrangements. (T-1).
       1.3.1.2. All efforts should be made to conduct informational interviews with all
       interested students. If this is not possible due to the number of interview requests, the
       interviewer may conduct an informational session at the law school. Sample recruiting
       briefings are available on the JAX website.
8                                                           AFI51-101 13 NOVEMBER 2014


       1.3.1.3. Judge advocates conducting law school visits should be familiar with the various
       TJAGC accession and summer internship programs. The JAG Corps public recruiting
       website located at www.airforce.com/jag and the JAX website contain helpful
       information for these visits.
       1.3.1.4. The SJA must ensure that judge advocates submit after-action reports through
       ARMS to JAX after every recruiting visit. (T-3). SJAs will ensure the reports are
       completed by 15 December for fall semester visits and 15 June for spring semester visits.
       (T-3). Using ARMS allows TJAG to access the reports immediately.
    1.3.2. ROTC Detachment Visits. JAX also assigns recruiting responsibilities for ROTC
    detachments to specific legal offices based on geographical proximity. A list of these
    responsibilities is published on the JAX website.
       1.3.2.1. The Air Force ROTC Educational Delay Program produces many high-quality
       judge advocates. Twice a year (fall and spring) every legal office should recruit at its
       assigned detachments for the Educational Delay Program. Since the educational delay
       board convenes in February of each year, offices should schedule spring visits as early as
       possible to give candidates time to apply.
       1.3.2.2. Greater attention to ROTC detachments requires additional time and effort for
       recruiters but offers tremendous potential. Accordingly, SJAs should seek opportunities
       to teach classes, lead seminars, or host detachments on a base visit—these are excellent
       ways to inform students about TJAGC.
    1.3.3. Alma Mater and Recruiting at National-Level Events.
       1.3.3.1. Alumni recruiting is a highly effective tool. All judge advocates are encouraged
       to visit and maintain contact with their law school alma maters. Prior to scheduling a
       formal visit to an alma mater, coordinate with JAX and the base legal office with
       responsibility for the school. Ideally, alma mater visits should coincide with the visits
       conducted by the responsible bases. With prior supervisory approval and approval from
       JAX, these visits may be nonchargeable leave or permissive TDY.
       1.3.3.2. JAGs participate annually in numerous recruiting events and diversity consortia
       nationwide. For certain events, JAX will hand-select and fund representatives of TJAGC
       to attend. SJAs should encourage their JAGs to volunteer for such opportunities.

                                           Chapter 2

                   FUNDED LEGAL EDUCATION PROGRAM (FLEP)

2.1. Program Description. The Secretary of the Air Force may direct the assignment of active
duty officers as students at American Bar Association (ABA)-approved law schools for a period
of training not to exceed 36 months leading to a Juris Doctor, and completion of legal licensing
requirements as further explained in para. 2.15. No more than 25 officers may commence such
training in any single fiscal year. JAX will not accept applications for FLEP during any period
in which the President is authorized by law to induct persons into the Armed Forces
involuntarily. During the FLEP, pay and allowances are authorized, and ordinary leave is
accumulated and may be granted. Officers in this program must, at a minimum, pursue a normal
day semester or quarter course schedule with the objective of receiving a Juris Doctor within 36
months. At the discretion of JAX and AFIT, officers may be directed to attend summer law
school sessions to accelerate their legal education. Before submitting an application for FLEP or
applying to law school, applicants must discuss this program with their functional manager at the
Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and obtain a conditional release from their career field
should TJAG select them for the FLEP.
2.2. Status of Personnel in Program. FLEP participants are active duty officers assigned to
AFIT. Officers will not engage in a course of conduct, activities, or lifestyle inconsistent with
that status. As active duty officers, FLEP students may not obtain any type of additional
employment without obtaining prior permission from JAX. FLEP students must submit an
application for paid off-duty employment in writing to the JAX Accessions Office. JAX will
process requests for paid off-duty employment in accordance with the Joint Ethics Regulation
and any other relevant law, authority, or guideline.
2.3. Eligibility. Title 10 U.S.C. §2004 establishes nonwaivable eligibility requirements. To be
eligible to apply for assignment under this program, an applicant must:
   2.3.1. Be a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force on extended active duty;
   2.3.2. Be a citizen of the United States;
   2.3.3. Have served on active duty (enlisted and/or commissioned service) for a period of not
   less than 2 years or no more than 6 years based upon the total active federal military service
   date (TAFMSD) at the time legal training begins.
       2.3.3.1. Periods of attendance at the United States Air Force Academy, United States
       Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, and the United States Coast Guard
       Academy do not count towards computation of the TAFMSD; however, periods spent at
       the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Preparatory School and in the Excess
       Leave Program (ELP) do.
   2.3.4. Be in the pay grade O-3 or below at the time legal training begins.
2.4. Program Prerequisites. Applicants must meet all of the following prerequisites:
   2.4.1. Be a graduate of a regionally accredited college or university with a baccalaureate

   2.4.2. Furnish a statement listing law schools where the applicant has been accepted or has
   applied. Do not delay the FLEP application process awaiting final acceptance by a law
   school. To participate in the FLEP, applicants ultimately must be accepted unconditionally
   for fall entry to a daytime program at an ABA-approved law school located in the United
   States. TJAG reserves the authority to specify the law school that the applicant will attend.
   2.4.3. Have completed the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and received the results
   from the Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS) or the Law School Admission
   Council (LSAC).
   2.4.4. If rated and on flying status, have served 3 years from the date of completion of the
   training which resulted in the award of an aeronautical rating as of the first day of law school
   classes.
2.5. Application Procedures. Applicants must apply online at www.airforce.com/jag.
   2.5.1. Applicants must interview with active duty SJAs at Air Force installations.
   Applicants must complete and submit their online application by 10 February of the calendar
   year of anticipated entry into law school. SJAs, or their designated accessions managers, will
   contact applicants to schedule their interviews. No later than the first day of the month in
   which the board will meet (e.g., 1 March if the board meets in March), the SJA will enter and
   submit to JAX the SJA’s interview report in the online Accessions Management System
   (AMS). (T-1).
   2.5.2. Upon the submission of an application, JAX will enter an assignment availability code
   (code 24) to remain in effect until 1 June of the calendar year of application. The code will
   be removed for all applicants not selected for the program.
2.6. Selection. TJAG selects applicants on a best-qualified basis, consistent with the needs of
the Air Force. TJAG appoints a board consisting of at least three active duty field grade judge
advocates to review the applications. The Director of JAX or another member of the JAX staff
serves as a member of the board. At least one board member should be a sitting or former SJA.
One member should be a former FLEP or ELP student. The JAX Chief of Accessions serves as
the board recorder. The board recommends selectees to TJAG who, at his or her discretion,
approves or disapproves the board’s recommendations, making final selections for appointment
under this program. Applicants are notified of the board results by letter or electronic mail (e-
mail).
2.7. Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC).
   2.7.1. The ADSC for participation in the FLEP is 2 years active duty for each academic year
   or part thereof of legal training. The minimum ADSC for individuals who initially
   participate in the Excess Leave Program (ELP) and then later complete their legal training in
   the FLEP is 5 years (e.g., 2 years as ELP and 1 year as FLEP = 5 years ADSC; 1 year as ELP
   and 2 years as FLEP = 5 years and 4 months ADSC).
   2.7.2. Officers who are dropped from the FLEP for deficiency in conduct, studies, or other
   reasons incur an ADSC of 1 year for each year or part thereof of participation in the FLEP.
   2.7.3. No portion of the FLEP period (including periods of legal internship) may be used to
   satisfy any preexisting ADSC. The ADSC for legal training under this program begins either
   at the termination or completion of this program, explained in para. 2.14, or upon completion
AFI51-101 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       11


   of any unfulfilled ADSC, whichever is later. Any existing, unfulfilled ADSC will commence
   upon termination or completion of the program, except the ADSC associated with the Post-
   9/11 GI Bill Transfer of Education Benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer of Education
   Benefits ADSC will run concurrent with the Legal Education ADSC if initiated prior to the
   commencement of or during the Legal Education ADSC. AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
   Commitments, Table 1.1.
   2.7.4. The combined active duty and inactive reserve commitment must total 8 years (e.g., 6
   years active duty and 2 years inactive reserve or 5 years active duty and 3 years inactive
   reserve).
   2.7.5. Each FLEP participant must complete an Air Force Form 63, Active Duty Service
   Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement.
2.8. Education Expenses.
   2.8.1. Applicants will incur all application expenses without reimbursement from the Air
   Force (e.g. law school applications and LSAT fees). The Air Force pays regularly
   established tuition and fees and additional allowances authorized by AFIT. Upon completion
   of law school, the individual officer is responsible for the fees and expenses of bar review
   courses and bar examinations.
   2.8.2. An officer who fails to complete the ADSC incurred in this program is subject to
   recoupment of a prorated portion of the cost of the tuition and other educational costs in an
   amount the Secretary of the Air Force determines.
2.9. Flying Status. According to AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical
Ratings and Badges, applicants for the program who are on flying status must include a separate
request for voluntary, permanent disqualification for aviation service. JAX will forward this
request to AFPC for those applicants selected for the program. AFPC will publish aeronautical
orders terminating the applicant’s flying status, effective the date of class entry.
2.10. AFIT and JAX Requirements. Officers in this program must comply with applicable
portions of AFITI 36-105, Civilian Institution Programs, unless AFIT has granted specific
exceptions. This includes, but is not limited to, officers maintaining a minimum 2.5 cumulative
GPA average on a 4.0 scale as detailed in AFITI 36-105. Any officer falling below this
minimum GPA requirement must immediately report the same to the AFIT representative and to
the Chief of Accessions and provide the same with an official law school transcript and any other
materials requested of the officer. Officers in law schools with a non-4.0 grading scale, must
obtain an official law school conversion to the 4.0 GPA scale with their cumulative GPA and
provide the same to the AFIT representative and the Chief of Accessions at the conclusion of
each law school semester or quarter attended. For questions, contact the Chief of Accessions.
2.11. Legal Internships.
   2.11.1. Legal internships are an integral part of legal training under the FLEP. During the
   first 2 years of the program, officers must perform legal internships during law school
   summer breaks. Internships must begin within 2 calendar days of the officer’s last
   examination or class, whichever is later, and may not end earlier than 2 calendar days before
   the start of fall classes. For periods in excess of this amount, the officer must comply with all
   leave and absence instructions and regulations and coordinate with AFIT and JAX.
 12                                                           AFI51-101 13 NOVEMBER 2014


       2.11.1.1. See Attachment 2 for internship program objectives. To the extent possible,
       the responsible legal offices should provide students with training opportunities in the
       legal areas identified during both summer internships.
   2.11.2. No later than 120 calendar days before law school summer break, each officer will
   notify AFIT and JAX of the beginning and ending dates of their summer break along with a
   list of the nearest Air Force installations. AFIT coordinates with JAX regarding the officer’s
   internship program and provides appropriate administrative support.
   2.11.3. JAX selects legal offices for all internship periods. Every effort will be made to
   assign students to the wing legal office at the Air Force installation nearest to the student’s
   law school. If circumstances warrant, internship duration and/or location can be curtailed or
   canceled at the discretion of TJAG or the Director of JAX.
   2.11.4. Officers must receive JAX approval for any leave during their internship that
   exceeds 10 duty days.
   2.11.5. No later than 14 calendar days after completion of each summer internship, the
   supervising SJA or supervising attorney shall complete an AF Form 77, Letter of Evaluation,
   and send a copy to JAX and AFIT. (T-3).
   2.11.6. Officers are not permitted to perform internships during the summer following
   completion of their third year of law school.
   2.11.7. Only TJAG or the Director of JAX is authorized to make exceptions to the policies
   contained in this paragraph.
2.12. Requests to Transfer Law Schools. Officers must coordinate and obtain approval from
JAX prior to applying for a law school transfer. Officers must submit transfer requests to JAX in
writing with a full explanation for why the transfer should be granted. JAX will coordinate with
AFIT on any submitted transfer requests prior to its decision. A transfer must not delay the
selectee’s anticipated graduation date or completion of legal licensing requirements. Officers
requesting to transfer to another law school will assume all costs and expenses associated with
such transfer without reimbursement from the Air Force.
2.13. Removal From Program. After consultation with TJAG, the AFIT commander may, at
his or her discretion, remove an officer from the program. TJAG may, at his or her sole
discretion, remove an officer from the program. Officers removed from the program for any
reason will be returned to their original career fields.
2.14. Program Completion.
   2.14.1. Participation in this program terminates upon completion of legal licensing
   requirements. See para. 2.15.
   2.14.2. Before graduation, officers are provided with follow-on assignment instructions.
   2.14.3. No later than 4 months before graduation, all officers must submit a memo to JAX
   that contains their projected graduation date, the jurisdiction and the date of their bar exam as
   required, and their projected bar admission date.
   2.14.4. Officers must obtain a legal license as soon as possible. In most jurisdictions, this
   requires passing a bar examination. In these jurisdictions, officers must take the first
   scheduled bar examination following graduation from law school either in the state where
AFI51-101 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                         13


   their law school is located or the state of their domicile. Officers requesting an exception to
   this location requirement must submit a written request justifying the reason(s) for such an
   exception to JAX, 120 days prior to the first day of the bar examination.
   2.14.5. Officers who fail to obtain a legal license as soon as possible, such as failing the first
   bar examination, must immediately notify the Chief of Accessions in writing detailing the
   circumstances surrounding the preparation and completion of the bar examination. The
   officer must also list the steps necessary to reattempt legal licensing, such as completing the
   next bar examination in either the same jurisdiction as their original examination or in any
   other jurisdiction authorized above. At his or her sole discretion, TJAG may return officers
   to their original career field who fail to obtain legal licensing for any reason, including failing
   a bar examination after their first attempt.
2.15. Designation as a Judge Advocate.
   2.15.1. At his or her sole discretion, TJAG designates an officer as a judge advocate IAW
   AFI 51-103, Judge Advocate Professional Development. Prior to designation, the officer
   must provide JAX with an official copy of his or her final law school transcript. Every judge
   advocate must be currently eligible to engage in the active practice of law in at least one
   jurisdiction. Therefore, the officer must provide proof that the officer is in active (or
   equivalent) status in to practice before the highest court of a United States (U.S.) state,
   commonwealth or territory, or the District of Columbia.
   2.15.2. Proof of good standing and admission to practice law is an original (e.g., raised or
   affixed official seal, original signatures, etc.) certificate or letter of good standing from the
   presiding judge, clerk, or other authorized official of the highest court of a state,
   commonwealth, territory, or of the District of Columbia of such jurisdiction. If the officer’s
   certificate or letter of good standing does not indicate his or her active (or equivalent) status,
   the officer must provide JAX a letter from the officer’s applicable bar indicating the officer’s
   status.

also AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. It is not charged against an officer’s leave account
and does not have to be repaid. No pay or allowances are authorized for such periods, and
ordinary leave is not accumulated. Officers continue to accrue time for promotion and
retirement purposes and remain eligible for other active duty benefits, such as medical services
