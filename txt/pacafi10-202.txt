                          PYRAMID NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

1.1. General. This instruction provides a system to expeditiously pass critical information to
HQ PACAF military and key civilian personnel. Primary method is an expanding telephonic
network (pyramid) to notify either only key personnel or the entire HQ Staff. An alternate
procedure is provided for recall during communications outages. The pyramid notification
system may be activated to implement a general recall, telephone standby, information relay, or
as a communications test of the notification system.
1.2. Responsibilities
   1.2.1. COMPACAF will direct activation of the Pyramid Notification System IAW
   established plans.
   1.2.2. Vice COMPACAF, when COMPACAF is unavailable, will direct activation of the
   pyramid notification system IAW established plans.
   1.2.3. Director of Operations, Plans and Policy (HQ PACAF A3/5), when COMPACAF and
   Vice COMPACAF are unavailable, will direct activation of the Pyramid Notification System
   IAW established plans.
   1.2.4. The PACAF Command Center (PCC) will develop and maintain procedures to notify
   each Directorate/Special Staff Agency.
   1.2.5. PACAF Command Center (PCC), when directed by appropriate authority (ref para
   1.2.1. thru 1.2.3.), will activate the HQ PACAF Pyramid Notification System. HQ
   PACAF/CCQ is the Headquarters Control Center (HCC) and will perform all accountability
   and strength accounting responsibilities.
   1.2.6. Directorates/Special Staff Agencies/Below the Line Units.
       1.2.6.1. Prepare and maintain organizational pyramid notification recall roster marking
       the roster "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY". E-mails shall be encrypted when they contain
       FOUO and/or Privacy Act Information. A sample format is provided in Figure 1.1. The
       recall rosters will be updated, as personnel changes occur to maintain the responsiveness
       of the system. Recall rosters and changes will be provided to the PACAF Command
       Center quarterly, or as changes occur.
          1.2.6.1.1. Recall rosters may be e-mailed provided they are sent from a ".mil" e-mail
          address to a ".mil" address. If providing a recall roster via e-mail, the following
          statement should be applied at the top of the e-mail: “The information herein is For
          Official Use Only (FOUO) which must be protected under the Privacy Act of
          1974, as amended. Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this PERSONAL
          INFORMATION may result in criminal and/or civil penalties.”
       1.2.6.2. Appoint a system monitor to maintain currency of the pyramid notification recall
       rosters. Provide the name of the system monitor to the PCC controller team via email
       (pacaf.a3pacafcommandcenter@us.af.mil).
 4                                                                PACAFI10-202 4 APRIL 2013


        1.2.6.2.1. Appoint Directorate Control Centers (DCC) representative by name to allow
        for HUCC to train and identify for coordination of data collection/reporting during
        activation of notification system.
        1.2.6.3. Distribute a current copy of the pyramid notification recall roster to each person
        listed in the diagram. All personnel will keep a copy of the recall roster with them at all
        times.
