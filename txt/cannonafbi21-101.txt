that maintain aircraft, aircraft systems, equipment, support equipment, and components
regardless of AFSC. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. Major
changes include removing inapplicable Cannon Air Force Base instructions pertaining to the
27th Fighter Wing and change the focus to the base reorganization to 27th Special Operations
Wing. This revision clarifies policy, regulation changes and corrects errors within the Sep 2006
edition. It has been revised in an effort to be more directive in nature, providing the user a clear
picture of responsibilities. Paragraph 4 (Added) incorporates information from paragraph 3.2
 2                                                CANNONAFBI21-101 21 NOVEMBER 2011


that did not pertain to equipment. All personnel should review this entire product for pertinent
changes.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Cannon Air Force Base will return to operational status as soon as practical after a
     mishap. The 27 SOW/CC or designated representative, as stated in AFI 10-2501, AF
     Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations, will determine the degree of
     emergency and make the immediate decision regarding the speed with which the runway is
     cleared. This decision is dictated by evaluation of alert status, number of returning aircraft,
     available weather alternates, and other operational criteria.
        1.1.1. Upon declaration of a potential or actual major aircraft accident on the runway or
        in close proximity, the following events will occur:
        1.1.2. All accident response agencies will be notified according to CAFB IEMP 10-2,
        Cannon Air Force Base Installation Emergency Management Plan.
        1.1.3. 27 SOMXG Quality Assurance (QA) will implement impoundment procedures for
        the affected aircraft using developed procedures in the Maintenance Operations Center
        (MOC) check list on all Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) that may have played a
        role in the mishap IAW 27 SOMXG MOC local check sheet. 27 SOMXG Quality
        Assurance Weight and Balance Program manager will be the focal point for any and all
        weight and balance issues during aircraft recovery operations.
        1.1.4. The MOC Senior Controller will notify the Special Operations Equipment
        Maintenance Squadron (SOEMS) Production Superintendent (ACES 2) of the mishap,
        and provide type of aircraft, location, amount of fuel on board, explosives on board, and
        known extent of aircraft damage. The Senior Controller will designate one aircraft
        maintenance radio net as the primary maintenance recovery operation net and direct all
        personnel not directly involved in the recovery operation to switch to an alternate net.
        The MOC will also notify all 27 SOMXG squadrons’ supervision that a crash recovery is
        in progress and to stand by to respond with additional personnel and equipment as
        directed by the on incident commander (IC).
        1.1.5. Once alerted of a recovery operation, 27 SOEMS Crash Recovery/Wheel and Tire
        (MXMMA) Shop’s Shift Supervisor will recall/assemble a recovery team and designate a
        Crash Recovery Team Chief with coordination of Flight Supervision and Squadron
        Maintenance Operations. A second team will be identified to sustain 24hr operations, if
        necessary.
        1.1.6. As required by the IC and Emergency Support Function (ESF) representative will
        provide manpower to assist in aircraft recovery procedures.
        1.1.7. The IC will request guidance from the 27 SOW/CC or 27 SOG/CC to determine
        risk and acceptable damage to aircraft if need for clearing of runway must be
        accomplished under emergency conditions. The IC will determine which of the
        following conditions exists:
            1.1.7.1. Emergency. This condition requires immediate runway clearance at the risk
            of losing personnel and equipment. Although rescue may be attempted, the runway
            will be cleared in 30 minutes or less.
CANNONAFBI21-101 21 NOVEMBER 2011                                                           3


        1.1.7.2. Urgent. This condition requires runway clearance as soon as possible after
        completion of rescue, fire fighting, and explosive ordinance disposal (EOD)
        operations. The runway will be cleared in less than 1 hour and 30 minutes, unless
        EOD consideration dictates otherwise, using techniques identified in applicable
        technical publications.
        1.1.7.3. Routine. This condition allows sufficient time to use recovery techniques to
        minimize further damage to aircraft and precludes exposing personnel or equipment
        to danger.
     1.1.8. The IC will use all assets available to ensure aircraft removal activities are
     conducted in a manner, which ensures the conditions of removal are met. Normally, this
     will be accomplished by the Crash, Damaged, or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR)
     representatives assigned to the 27 SOEMS/MXMMA section. After initial evaluation,
     the Crash Recovery Team Chief will coordinate with IC for any required assistance.
     Under certain conditions, such as "emergency" or "urgent", time may not permit the use
     of normal procedures. In this case, the IC and ESF will decide which removal methods
     are best, and which disaster response activities (such as EOD, fire fighting,
     decontamination, and rescue) defined in AFI 10-2501 may or may not proceed. Under
     these conditions, every on-base asset may be called into recovery operations.
     1.1.9. Recovery operations will proceed under the detailed instructions of AFI 10-2501
     and CAFB IEMP 10-2 to ensure all functions work as a cohesive team utilizing detailed
     plans for maintenance activities, Crash Recovery and/or Emergency Aircraft Removal
     Procedures and appropriate checklists. As a minimum equipment listed in AFI 21-101
     AFSOCSUP_1, Para 14.10.3 may be necessary for removal operations and used as a
     guide. A list of possible equipment is detailed below. When required, bulldozers, flatbed
     trucks, front-end loaders, cranes, forklifts, and a tractor trailers to transport CDDAR
     support equipment to the mishap site, as well as transport wreckage to the wreckage
     assembly point may be required for the recovery operation. A list of equipment status
     will be provided to the ESF upon notification of aircraft mishap.
  1.1.10. 27 SOMSG will:
        1.1.10.1. Provide emergency crash/fire response, as well as hazardous materials and
        spill containment capability beyond the scope of the unit spill teams.
        1.1.10.2. Provide security force personnel to secure mishap scene and the wreckage
        assembly point, as directed by the IC/ESF.
        1.1.10.3. Provide heavy equipment, i.e., bulldozers, cranes, and dump trucks, as
        required by the CDDAR Team Chief through the IC.
        1.1.10.4. Provide maintenance support to heavy equipment participating in the
        recovery operation, as directed by the IC/ESF.
        1.1.10.5. Provide on-scene fuel servicing of recovery support equipment, to include
        AGE and heavy equipment. Also, provide fuel sample/analysis of aircraft fuel IAW
        TO 42B-1-1 para 4.10 and AFI 23-201 para 7.20.
        1.1.10.6. Coordinate through the ESF for contracting support on specialized
        equipment not available to support recovery operations.
