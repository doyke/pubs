1. General.
    1.1. Program Goals: All aircrew members will be familiar with procedures and documentation
    requirements of this instruction. Purchase of aviation fuel not complying with this instruction may
    become the financial responsibility of the purchaser. Aircraft will be refueled/defueled at Department
    of Defense (DOD) locations unless DOD owned fuel is not available. Fuel may be procured from
    other sources using the following priority.
       1.1.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane fuel contracts.
       1.1.2. Foreign Government Air Forces.
       1.1.3. Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card Government into-plane locations.
       1.1.4. Open market purchases to include Shell International Trading Company (SITCO) agree-
       ment.
NOTE: DOD Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Enroute Supplements identify locations with
into-plane contracts. Additionally, the Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card web site
can be accessed directly on the Travis AFB Crew Dog web page or at https://www.airseacard.com.

2. AVPOL Documentation use and Procedures.
    2.1. AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, is used to log and store all AVPOL transac-
    tions and documentation. Log all transactions on the front of AF Form 664. Use one line entry per
    receipt/transaction. Insert supporting documentation into envelope. Exception: Specific aircrew pro-
    cedures (i.e., Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB’s)) may omit this requirement.
    2.2. Standard Form 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, is used to purchase aviation fuel and
    ground services at non-DOD locations that do not accept the AIR Card. In accordance with Defense
    Logistic Agency (DLA)regulations, the AF Form 315 and AF Form 15 will no longer be used to pur-
    chase fuel and services.
       2.2.1. Instructions for completing the Standard Form 44 are located in Attachment 2.
       2.2.2. Log all transactions on the front of AF Form 664. Place completed Standard Form 44 and

   2.4. Fund cites for ground and fuel services will be annotated by the Wing Refueling Document Con-
   trol Officer (WRDCO). Leave block 14 of Standard Form 44 blank.
   2.5. In cases where the merchant will not accept a Standard Form 44 or uses their own delivery ticket,
   ensure the following information is legibly entered on their paperwork: Quantity of fuel in U.S. gal-
   lons or exact statement of services rendered, aircraft tail number, flying squadron, and aircraft home
   station.
       2.5.1. Complete SF 44 with the statement: “Standard Form 44 not provided to merchant”.
       2.5.2. Leave “Seller” section blank and mark Block 20 as follows: “Standard Form 44 not pro-
       vided to merchant.” Insert merchant’s delivery ticket number.
       2.5.3. Attach a copy of delivery ticket to Standard Form 44.
       2.5.4. If problems with a merchant are encountered, make a note and place it inside the AF Form
       664. Write “Attention WRDCO” on the note. Include type of payment made.
       2.5.5. If merchant does not provide a signature, write: “merchant refused to sign” in block 20 of
       Standard Form 44.
NOTE: Do not sign purchase orders or invoices of merchants for foreign governments if a Stan-
dard Form 44 was used to purchase fuel or services. When a merchant requires both Standard
Form 44 and their own invoices, both forms should be clearly marked to indicate duplicate forms
were provided. This will prevent duplicate payments. Do not sign Standard Form 44 and AIR Card
receipt for the same purchase, sign one or the other. If the merchant insists on signatures upon both
receipts, notify the WRDCO promptly upon return to home station.
   2.6. Purchases at Canadian into-plane contract locations (i.e., Gander, Newfoundland) will be docu-
   mented using a local merchant’s invoice. Standard Form 44 and AIR Card will not be used. This is the
   only time the AIR Card will not be used for fuel purchases at a commercial location. Contractors will
   provide the crew with a copy of the invoice. Log the transaction and place a copy of invoice inside AF
   Form 664.
   2.7. Purchases at Shell International Trading Company (SITCO) agreement locations require present-
   ing the aircraft identaplate. The invoice must include: date of transaction, grade of product, quantity
   issued or defueled, unit of measure, and signature of Air Force representative. If the merchant also
   requires a Standard Form 44 in addition to their invoice, annotate on merchant’s invoice “AF Forms
   executed: Reference merchant invoice #____”. Log and place all documentation inside AF Form 664.
   2.8. Purchases at commercial airfields are accomplished using the AIR Card first, then Standard Form
   44. Refer to DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel and Services at Commercial Location, Appendix
   2, and Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of this instruction for guidelines on completing these forms.

    2.9. Purchases at foreign military airfields, including Replacement-In-Kind (RIK) locations, use host
    nation forms to record purchases. Information from the aircraft’s identaplate should be hand scribed
    on host nation forms. Log and place a copy inside AF Form 664.
NOTE: If contractors insist on completing their own forms or invoices in addition to DD Form
1898 Avfuels Into-Plane Sales Slip, the invoice must be annotated “Duplicate DD Form 1898 accom-
plished, reference DD Form 1898 #_____.”

           5.1.2.2. The boom operator will record in-flight off-loads on the DD Form 791, IAW AFM
           23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 1, Part 3. See Attachment 3 for further guidance.
       5.1.3. US Air Force, US Marine Corps, and US Navy Tail Numbers: Aircraft commanders will
       ensure tail numbers of receivers are verified after flight by the boom operator using USAF and
       USN/USMC Reliability and Maintainability Information System Spreadsheets (REMISS) avail-
       able at maintenance debrief and on the Crew Dog web page. Attempt to resolve tail number dis-
       crepancies with offending unit(s) at the earliest opportunity. Using REMISS will identify errors
       early and allow 60 AMW to recover a significant amount of fuel charges.
       5.1.4. In-flight issues from tanker to other aircraft will be recorded on DD Form 791, by the
       tanker boom operator.
TRAVISAFBI23-102 4 OCTOBER 2007                                                                            7


      5.1.5. Boom operators will ensure they have a DD Form 791, prior to departure for in-flight refu-
      eling missions. In-flight issues will not be consolidated.
      5.1.6. Prior to a scheduled in-flight refueling mission, boom operators should obtain information
      about aircraft to be refueled. All available mission profile information will be utilized and entered
      on DD Form 791. Do not rely on the receiver’s home station as an indicator of the possessing
      MAJCOM, they may have other MAJCOM’s aircraft attached to them.
         5.1.6.1. Obtain receiver information in-flight using the following means:
             5.1.6.1.1. Visually, if receiver has tail numbers clearly visible.
         5.1.6.2. By boom interphone on aircraft so equipped.
             5.1.6.2.1. By aircraft radio, if communications will not compromise EMISSION OPTION
             2, 3, or 4. Inter-plane radios will not be used during actual EMCON 2, 3, or 4 to obtain or
             verify air-refueling data, unless specifically authorized by competent authority. Utilizing
             HAVE QUICK II and/or Secure Voice should be considered.
NOTE: Under NO circumstances will any of this data be obtained by any of the aforementioned
means if it interferes with or threatens safety of flight.
         5.1.6.3. During post mission aircrew debrief, the boom operator will insure all information on
         DD Form 791 is correct and complete by validating with REMISS on Travis AFB Crew Dog
         web page.
             5.1.6.3.1. After validation with REMISS.
                 5.1.6.3.1.1. Enter aircraft MDS, organization, and mission call sign.
                 5.1.6.3.1.2. Ensure all information written on the form is clear and legible.
                 5.1.6.3.1.3. Information not obtained prior to or in-flight shall be obtained after flight.
             5.1.6.3.2. If unable to validate DD Form 791 information, call receiver aircraft’s home
             base and correct the problem.
                 5.1.6.3.2.1. “Known or suspected” aircraft serial numbers assigned to the unit being
                 refueled, but not necessarily the actual aircraft refueled, will not be used. Receiver unit
                 aircraft serial numbers are compared to fuel load reports at Travis AFB using REMISS
                 tables. If aircraft tail number being billed was in maintenance, or unable to fly; the fuel
                 bill will be rejected and 60 AMW will be liable for the fuel.
                 5.1.6.3.2.2. Incomplete DD Forms 791 should be turned into the SRDCO with a brief
                 written explanation in remarks block.
         5.1.6.4. DD Form 791 will be used for all in-flight off-load transactions and jettisons. All
         blocks will be filled out with the exception of gallons (pounds will be used for in flight refu-
         els). When tanker aircraft jettison fuel, jettisoned quantity will be charged to the command in
         possession of the aircraft. Transactions will be recorded in pounds on DD Form 791, clearly
         annotated as “jettisoned.”
         5.1.6.5. In the event a classified in-flight refueling was accomplished, complete DD Form 791
         with as much information as possible and forward to the WRDCO.

           5.1.6.6. Step-by-step instructions for completing a DD Form 791 are located in Attachment 3
           of this instruction.
       5.1.7. Upon mission completion, aircraft commanders will quality check all AF Form 664 entries
       and accompanying receipts for accuracy and legibility. Place a copy of all fuel documents into the
       AF Form 664. Use the following statement: “I validate all entries”. The aircraft commander will
       print name, squadron, mission number, date and sign below last entry on AF Form 664 to validate
       entries and contents. See Table 6.

6. Maintenance Procedures.
     6.1. Maintenance Personnel will:
        6.1.1. Appoint a Wing AVPOL advisory group representative.
        6.1.2. Ensure that a copy of DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel and Services at Commercial
        Location and this instruction are on board every aircraft; include examples of properly completed
        AF Forms 664, 1994, 1896, Standard Form 44, and DD Form 791.
        6.1.3. Ensure each assigned aircraft has a valid DD Form 1896, AIR Card, and that these items are
        on board. Validate the DODAAC, CIC, ORG, and tail number for each aircraft assigned. Notify
        the local Base Fuels Management Flight (LGRF) immediately upon inter/intra-aircraft transfer or
        other changes that would require a new identaplate issued to the aircraft.
        Example: If all 60 AMW aircraft deploying to a Tanker Task Force were to become assets
        of that theater commander and fuel liability would rest with same, then a new DD Form
        1896 would be cut for this event.
            6.1.3.1. If AIR Card is lost enroute, make an entry on the AF Form 781A. Documents search
            results and all relevant details.
TRAVISAFBI23-102 4 OCTOBER 2007                                                                        11


          6.1.3.2. If AIR Card is missing from a deployed aircraft, inform maintenance supervision and
          document missing card in the AF Form 781A.
          6.1.3.3. In either case call 1-866-308-3811 inform AIR Card support team the AIR Card for
          the aircraft is lost. The technician will give you a new card number to use for the remainder of
          the mission. Insure a new card is ordered upon aircraft’s return to home station.
      6.1.4. Prior to deployment, ensure an adequate supply of fuels transaction documents are onboard
      the aircraft to complete the deployment. Ensure each aircraft has a sufficient supply of AF Form
      664, for each mission.
      6.1.5. Prior to aircrew going into crew rest, insure aircraft commander signs all required Standard
      Form 44s for services.
   6.2. Maintenance debrief will establish procedures to:
      6.2.1. Hand carry completed AF Form 664 with all receipts to the WRDCO on a weekly basis.
      6.2.2. Ensure all flying hours and fuels issue data are recorded accurately on AFTO Form 781,
      and AFTO Form 781H. Make sure AFTO Form 781H, Block 17, “Servicing Certification”,
      reflects name, spelled out, of location where fuel servicing occurred. Abbreviations, such as
      TAFB, will not be used.
      6.2.3. Establish a suspense file for AFTO Form 781H after removal from aircraft jacket files or a
      copy of AFTO Form 781H for aircraft PCSing out. Retain for 90 days after inter-fund billing to
      provide a secondary audit trail for fuel issues and flying hours (Reference: DESC-I-31, Purchase
      of Aviation Fuel and Services at Commercial Location).

7. Base Fuels Management (LGRF).
   7.1. Base Fuels Management will:
      7.1.1. Appoint a Wing AVPOL Advisory Group representative.
      7.1.2. Process all fuel on-load and off-load documentation.
      7.1.3. Review the list of potential erroneous transactions provided by the WRDCO and annotate
      those transactions that are in fact erroneous. Return the annotated list to the WRDCO. Provide the
      WRDCO with the following data to be incorporated into the monthly AVPOL report:
          7.1.3.1. Organization.
          7.1.3.2. Mission/Design/Series (MDS).
          7.1.3.3. Total gallons consumed monthly/yearly.
          7.1.3.4. Total dollars monthly/yearly.
          7.1.3.5. Free Fuel.

      8.1.2. Provide DFAS-FV-OM a memorandum indicating the monthly AVPOL cost estimate
      based upon projected flying hours.
      8.1.3. Upon receipt of the previous months actual flying hour data, establish and provide
      DFAS-FV-OM a memorandum indicating necessary Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement
      Document (MORD) adjustments.
      8.1.4. Ensure DFAS-FV-OM is properly posting MORD adjustments on a monthly basis.
