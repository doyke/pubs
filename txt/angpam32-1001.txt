This pamphlet implements AFPD 10-10, Civil Aircraft Use of United States Air Force Airfields, and
AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities, and applies to Air National Guard (ANG) flying units that oper-
ate on public airports. This pamphlet provides guidance for negotiating fair and reasonable charges to the
Government (AF) for joint use of the flying facilities of a public airport.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

It adds clarification of responsibilities, standard forms and processes, allowable costs and calculation pro-
cedures. It corrects policy with regard to local operations agreements, joint participation projects and long
term leases.


1. General .
   1.1. Title 49, United States Code (USC), Chapter 471, ‘Airport Development (Title 49 USC, Sections
   47101-47129), provides that each of the airport’s facilities developed with financial assistance from
   the United States Government and each of the airport’s facilities usable for the landing and taking off
   of aircraft always will be available without charge for use by Government aircraft in common with
   other aircraft, except that if the use is substantial, the Government may be charged a reasonable share,
   proportionate to the use, of the cost of operating and maintaining the facility used.
   1.2. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Grant Assurance 27 defines substantial use as any one of
   the following:
       1.2.1. Five (5) or more Government aircraft regularly based at the airport or on land adjacent
       thereto
       1.2.2. The total number of movements (counting each landing as a movement) of Government air-
       craft is 300 or more in a month.
2                                                                     ANGPAM32-1001 8 APRIL 2003


       1.2.3. The gross accumulative weight of Government aircraft using the airport (the total move-
       ment of Government aircraft multiplied by gross weights of such aircraft) is in excess of five mil-
       lion pounds in a month.
    1.3. Where the ANG has aircraft permanently assigned on a civilian airport, substantial use will be
    acknowledged and a payment agreement made to reimburse the airport for a reasonable share, propor-
    tionate to the total military use (assigned and transient), of the cost of operating and maintaining the
    facilities used.

2. Responsibilities and Authorities.
    2.1. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Installations, (SAF/IEI), is responsible for policy and
    oversight for the Air Force's installation programs and is the approval authority for Airport Joint Use
    Agreements (AJUAs). All negotiated agreements must be submitted in writing to SAF/IEI for
    approval prior to signature by the concerned parties
    2.2. Air Force General Counsel, (SAF/GCN) will be a coordinating office on negotiated agreements
    to ensure they are legally sufficient prior to approval by SAF/IEI.
    2.3. The Air National Guard Civil Engineer, (ANG/CE) is responsible for negotiation of agreements
    where a based ANG unit is the host. Negotiations will be coordinated with all other military units
    assigned at or operating from the location. Authority to negotiate agreements and renewals will not be
    delegated to the field unit.
    2.4. United States Property and Fiscal Officer (USPFO), will act in a advisory role during negotia-
    tions for ANG and Army National Guard units, but will have no authority to conduct negotiations or
    agree to terms and conditions for the AJUA.
    2.5. ANG Units. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) will facilitate data collection and meetings, but will
    have no authority to conduct negotiations or agree to terms and conditions for the AJUA. Operations
    personnel will assist in collecting flight data and validating percentage of flying by non-ANG units.
    Various base offices will assist in calculating the value of ANG provided services

3. Standard Procedures and Formats. To ensure consistency among agreements, all AJUAs will fol-
low a standard process for calculation of fees and a standard format agreement (Attachment 2).
    3.1. Air National Guard Civil Engineer Programs Division (ANG/CEP) will initiate renewal negotia-
    tions with airport owner/operators not less than one (1) year prior to the expiration of the AJUA then
    in effect. The new AJUA should be signed by all parties prior to the expiration of the existing agree-
    ment.
       3.1.1. When a renewal can not be completed prior to expiration of the existing agreement, the unit
       must take steps to ensure all payments are terminated.
       3.1.2. If fiscal years are crossed while negotiations are ongoing, funds in the budget for each year
       should obligated via AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document
       (MORD), in accordance with Defense Finance and Accounting Service DFAS-DE 7010.2-R,
       Commercial Transactions at Base Level, until a final fee is agreed to. Missed payments are then
       made with these properly obligated funds.
ANGPAM32-1001 8 APRIL 2003                                                                                   3


      3.1.3. When a renewal can not be completed prior to expiration of the existing agreement, Title 42
      USC, Chapter 15A, Subchapter 1, Sec. 1856b allows a unit that is the primary source of fire pro-
      tection on the airport to continue to respond to civil aircraft emergencies.
   3.2. Mid-term renewals can be requested by either the Government (ANG) or the airport if services
   provided or costs incurred have changed significantly. Both parties must agree to a mid-term renego-
   tiation.
   3.3. The renewal process will be completed in four phases.
      3.3.1. Phase 1 - Data Collection. A copy of this pamphlet and associated cost worksheet will be
      provided to each airport prior to negotiations. The cost worksheet and control tower operations
      information must be collected by the airport and unit and forwarded to ANG/CEP prior to sched-
      uling a negotiation meeting.
          3.3.1.1. If the airport has an alternative budget document that clearly delineates joint use area
          operations and maintenance costs, it can be submitted in lieu of the cost worksheet.
          3.3.1.2. Control tower operations information should include, as a minimum, the total number
          of military operations for an entire fiscal or calendar year and the total number of all opera-
          tions for the same period.
      3.3.2. Phase 2 - Negotiation. A team from ANG/CEP will meet with unit representatives and air-
      port officials to reach an agreement in principal – new fee and term of agreement. This phase gen-
      erally concludes in a single meeting, but can require several meetings if additional data is required
      or there is disagreement over the cost calculation.
      3.3.3. Phase 3 - Draft Agreement. When an agreement in principal is reach, ANG/CEP will pro-
      duce a draft document using the standard format at Attachment 2. This draft will be sent electron-
      ically to the unit and airport officials for review. When the draft is approved by all parties it will be
      sent to SAF/IEI for approval to execute.
      3.3.4. Phase 4 - Final Agreement. After SAF/IEI approval, three originals of a final document will
      be forwarded to the unit for signatures. Following final signature by ANG/CE, originals will be
      provided to the unit base civil engineer (BCE), the airport authority and one will be maintained in
      ANG/CEP.
          3.3.4.1. Government signatures on the document are the Adjutant General, the United States
          Property and Fiscal Officer (coordination only) and ANG Civil Engineer (final signature on
          behalf of the Chief, Air National Guard).
          3.3.4.2. Airport signatures can vary depending on local requirements. Requested signature
          blocks should be identified by the airport during the draft review.
   3.4. If negotiations reach an impasse, the issue will be referred to the Air Force Audit Agency
   (AFAA) for a management advisory service (MAS). AFAA will review all airport and military costs
   and operations and issue a determination on the appropriate fee. This determination will be binding on
   the ANG and will limit any further negotiations.

4. Allowable Costs and Cost Sharing .
   4.1. The AJUA is not a contract or Federal award. It is a payment document. As such it does not
   require a contracting warrant for execution and is not subject to the cost accounting principals of
4                                                                      ANGPAM32-1001 8 APRIL 2003


    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian
    Tribal Governments.
    4.2. The AJUA fee will be determined by multiplying the airport’s operations and maintenance costs
    for the jointly used areas by the percentage of military operations and subtracting appropriate credits
    for military provided services.
    4.3. ANG will share in appropriate direct costs of operating and maintaining the jointly used areas.
    Attachment 3 is a guide to calculating allowable costs. This is just a guide and is not necessarily all
    inclusive. Additional categories may be included, but must be accompanied by supporting documen-
    tation. Alternative budget documents produced by the airport for other purposes may be submitted in
    lieu of this worksheet if they clearly delineate direct joint use area costs from all other airport costs.
       4.3.1. Direct costs do not include the overhead costs of operating the airport such as:
           4.3.1.1. Indirect costs (consulting fees, professional fees, environmental fines, training, facil-
           ity maintenance, etc.)
           4.3.1.2. Administrative overhead (administrative salaries, marketing, travel, postage, janito-
           rial, telephone, office supplies, uniforms etc.)
           4.3.1.3. Authority accounting (profit, overhead, debt service, depreciation, deferred mainte-
           nance, contingencies, etc.)
           4.3.1.4. Insurance (liability or fire)
       4.3.2. The jointly used areas are generally only the runways and taxiways of the airfield.
           4.3.2.1. Jointly used area costs do not include commercial areas such as terminals, parking
           ramps, maintenance hangars, parking garages, etc.
           4.3.2.2. Certain features of the airfield will not be excluded from the cost calculation simply
           because they are not routinely used by the based military aircraft. Example: the maintenance
           costs and traffic counts associated with a runway that is too short for the based aircraft will not
           be excluded since it could be used by military aircraft from other units.
       4.3.3. Where the airport, at the military’s written request, provides a service specifically and
       solely for the benefit of the military, 100% of the airport’s expense can be claimed under the
       AJUA. Specific supporting documentation of actual costs must be provided by the airport to jus-
       tify these 100% line items.
    4.4. Proportionate use is defined as the percentage of military operations. This will be calculated by
    dividing the total number of military operations by the total number of all operations as shown in a
    tower count for an entire fiscal year or calendar year.
       4.4.1. Weight based calculations will not be allowed. The operations and maintenance costs cov-
       ered by the AJUA are not affected by aircraft weight so it is not an appropriate metric for deter-
       mining the military proportionate use.
       4.4.2. Each unit that contributes to the total percentage of military operations, regardless of ser-
       vice, component or home station, will be individually responsible for their portion of the fee. The
       host, in most cases ANG, will be responsible for negotiating on behalf of all military users, but is
       not responsible for paying the whole fee. The total fee will be prorated to all military users based
       on their proportion of the military tower count.
ANGPAM32-1001 8 APRIL 2003                                                                                5


      4.4.3. Where helicopter operations are included in the military tower count, each helicopter oper-
      ation will be counted on an equal basis with fixed wing aircraft. No discount will be given since
      the costs covered under the AJUA are not dependent on the weight of the aircraft. The only excep-
      tion to this rule would be a location where the helicopter unit has it’s own landing pads and does
      not use the joint areas of the airport in any way. In this case, the helicopter count should be elimi-
      nated from the tower counts.
   4.5. Proportionate use by the government will be offset by any significant contributions in kind pro-
   vided by the military (fire protection services, control tower operations, weather services, snow
   removal equipment and operations, etc.).
      4.5.1. The offset for provided services is based on the value of the cost avoidance to the airport.
      Only the portion of a service the airport would be required to supply per FAA rules can be consid-
      ered an offset to the AJUA fee. Example: if the military fire department is primary on the airfield
      and the station has 24 people, but FAA would only require a station with 16, then the offset would
      be the value of salaries, vehicles, equipment, etc., for 16 people.
      4.5.2. Where fire protection is provided under a mutual aid agreement, the costs for either party
      (airport or ANG unit) will be considered as offsetting. Fire protection will not be a part of the cost
      calculation and the final agreement will only make reference to the mutual aid agreement.
      4.5.3. Only direct costs of providing the services will be considered when determining the offset
      since only direct airport costs are allowed as part of the AJUA fee.
   4.6. An inflation clause can be added to the calculated fee if all calculations are done using past year
   actual cost figures. If the calculation uses projected budget figures then inflation is already included
   and will not be added again.
      4.6.1. The maximum inflation allowable is the Air Force (AF) recognized consumer price index
      value. This will be added to each year’s fee over the term of the agreement and then converted
      back to a level annual payment to simplify accounting.

5. Terms and Conditions.
   5.1. AJUA payments can be made in a variety of ways depending on local requirements or desires
   (monthly, quarterly, annually). The standard document assumes payments will be made in arrears.
   Payment in advance can be allowed if additional language is added to the agreement stipulating a
   pro-rata return of the payment in the event of early termination.
   5.2. AJUAs will normally be for a period of five (5) years. AJUAs may be negotiated for a shorter
   period if there is sufficient justification provided by the airport. Longer AJUAs may be negotiated at
   the mutual agreement of both parties.
   5.3. If requested by both parties, a separate operations agreement can be drafted and signed at the
   local level. This operations agreement can cover such issues as airfield access and security, emergency
   procedures, snow plans, masterplanning arrangements, etc. but will not include any financial provi-
   sions. This agreement can be referenced in the AJUA if the signed document is submitted with the
   AJUA for staffing.
   5.4. Where fire protection is provided by the ANG or the airport exclusively, the local unit may draft
   and sign a separate fire operations agreement. This agreement can cover operational issues but will
6                                                                      ANGPAM32-1001 8 APRIL 2003


    not include any financial provisions. This agreement can be referenced in the AJUA if the signed doc-
    ument is submitted with the AJUA for staffing.
    5.5. Where air traffic control services are provided by the ANG, either through an air traffic control
    squadron or by contract services, the local unit may draft and sign a separate air traffic control opera-
    tions agreement. This agreement can cover operational issues but will not include any financial provi-
    sions. This agreement can be referenced in the AJUA if the signed document is submitted with the
    AJUA for staffing.

6. Related Issues - Major Repairs, New Construction and Leases.
    6.1. The AJUA covers operations and maintenance costs only. Major repair and/or new construction
    projects required in the jointly used areas of the airport are not included in the AJUA. ANG contribu-
    tion to any such project will be negotiated and covered in a separate written agreement with the
    owner/operator of the airport at the time the work is required. No offsets to the AJUA fee will be
    sought for joint participation in these projects. No increase in the AJUA fee will be granted for
    projects completed by the airport or the depreciation associated with them.
       6.1.1. Joint participation projects will be completed using a military construction cooperative
       agreement (MCCA). These agreements are separate and distinct from the AJUA and must be able
       to stand the audit test on their own merit. MCCAs can be initiated by the local BCE and are sub-
       mitted to ANG/CEP for approval and programming.
       6.1.2. Joint participation projects will be evaluate for approval based on three criteria. There must
       be a military need for the project, the project must not be eligible for Airport Improvement Project
       (AIP) funding through FAA, and there must be federal funds available for the project.
           6.1.2.1. If a project is eligible for FAA funding under the AIP program then the maximum fed-
           eral participation will be provided by FAA. ANG will not offset the FAA share of the project
           and can not, by law, offset the minimum contribution required by the airport.
    6.2. Long term leases for property occupied by ANG units are separate and distinct from the AJUA.
    While some AJUAs do run concurrently with the lease, they are separate programs and are not depen-
    dent upon each other. No offset to the AJUA fee will be sought for lease payments made and no
    increase in AJUA fee will be granted to the airport to supplement lease payments.
       6.2.1. In most cases, lease payments for property occupied by the ANG unit is at a nominal rate
       ($1 per year). This is consistent with FAA policy which states that aviaition related military units
       are not required to pay fair market value for leased property. This practice does not violate FAA
       Grant Assurances.
