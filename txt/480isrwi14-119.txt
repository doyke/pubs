1. 1. Overview:
        1.1.1. This instruction outlines the establishment and maintenance of the MIP. It directs
        actions and assigns responsibilities for implementing continuing improvements to the
        execution of assigned missions.          MIP focuses on recommended architectural,
        hardware/software, training, and work environment improvements to refine and enhance
        overall mission effectiveness. As such, it is intended to augment, not replace other
        programs such as Air Force Instruction (AFI) 38-401, The Air Force Innovative
        Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program, Air National Guard
        Instruction (ANGI) 38-401, Suggestion Program, AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons
        Learned Program, Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency
        (AFISRA) Instruction 10-415, Weapons and Tactics Program, Air Force Smart
        Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21), SAF/US(M), AFSO21 Playbook and other
        formal processes.
        1.1.2. ANG Intelligence Wings, Groups, and Squadrons engaged in Distributed Common
        Ground System (DCGS) Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) are requested
        to collaborate on ANG submitted improvements with the 480 ISR WG via regular e-
        mails and the 480 ISR WG Weapons & Tactics Community of Practice (CoP) on SIPRnet
        at
        “https://afkm.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=338.”
        1.1.3. AFRES and ANG Classic Associate Units may develop their own MIPs but should
        collaborate and integrate with their Regular Air Force counterparts to the maximum
        extent possible in order to facilitate solutions to shared issues.
        1.1.4. Crews should use the MIP program for mission improvements not tactical
        improvements, however, crew members should not delay submissions in order to
        determine the most appropriate channel to use. The unit’s MIP Office of Primary
        Responsibility (OPR) will ensure submissions are routed appropriately.
           1.1.4.1. Mission improvement examples include such things as the development of
           Unified Collection and Reporting Network (UNICORN), ergonomic enhancements to
           the workplace, modified internal crew procedures, creation of new software scripts, or
           anything that may improve mission operations.
               1.1.4.1.1. When mission improvements rely on or relate to the acquisition of new
               architectural, software, or hardware for the AF DCGS Weapons System baseline
               equipment, use the AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal and route through
               established channels.
           1.1.4.2. In contrast, tactics improvements address tactical deficiencies in the use of
           platforms, sensors, etc., often involving external DCGS entities. Follow procedure
           outlined in AFISRAI10-415 _480ISRWGSUP for recommending tactic
           improvements.
     1.2. Submission Procedures.
        1.2.1. Initiation. Any member may initiate a Mission Improvement Request (MIR) for
        consideration within the MIP. MIRs are submitted in accordance with local procedures
480ISRWI14-119 31 MAY 2013                                                                     3


     developed by the unit OPR. This could be via a website, blog, email, paper submission,
     or in person to the MIP OPR.
     1.2.2. Development. Once received, the MIP OPR will review the MIR. The OPR will
     communicate with the originator and anyone else with input on the proposal within seven
     duty days of the submission date. The OPR will work with the submitter to capture the
     essence of the concept, assign a locally developed numbering system to track each MIR
     through disposition and allocate/coordinate resources to assess the feasibility of the
     action item.
     1.2.3. Evaluation. Once the MIR is created, the OPR, using locally developed criteria,
     will make a determination on the best forum for MIR resolution. Then the MIP OPR will
     forward the MIR to the appropriate office for action. When possible, the originator
     should attend the forum when the MIR will be discussed. In the absence of the
     originator, the MIP OPR will present the MIR. For example, should the most appropriate
     disposition be a Crew Information File (CIF), AF 1067, Modification Proposal or other
     such specific process, the MIP OPR will work with the originator to create the document
     and forward through the appropriate local channels.
     1.2.4. Disposition. Disposition of the MIR occurs when it is fully implemented as a
     standard practice within the organization, or the item has been evaluated or rejected and
     the submitting member informed of the outcome and reason for disapproval. For
     instance, the MIR is incorporated into training for the affected crew position(s)
     checklists, local procedures, instructions, and policies are published and the Standards
     and Evaluations office has incorporated the procedure into evaluations as appropriate.
  1.3. Responsibilities.
