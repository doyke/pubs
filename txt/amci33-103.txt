                                            Chapter 1

                            TRAFFIC ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

1.1. Overview. The purpose of traffic analysis is to provide a detailed snapshot of all High
Frequency (HF) transmitted messages, Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) links, and phone
patches (ZAF). All Emergency Action Messages (EAM), aircraft (ACFT) advisories (FOX),
ZAFs, each time an ACFT type is supported, and ALE links, preprogrammed (PREPRO) ZAFs,
and Automatic Message Display (AMD) directly dialed ZAFs are totaled for each HF Global
Communications System (HFGCS) global station (STN). This data enables leadership, users,
potential users, and other agencies to acquire and maintain Situational Awareness (SA) of the
type and volume of support we provide to our users.
     1.1.1. This data is compiled at the end of each radio day (RADAY; 0001Z-2400Z).
     1.1.2. The entire traffic analysis must be complete prior to the end of the local duty day
     (2400L). Otherwise, a system administrator must change the Operating System‟s (OS) date
     to that of the specific RADAY in which traffic analysis is being co nducted.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. HFGCS Master Net Control Station (MNCS): The HFGCS NCS that has OPCON,
     for the RADAY that traffic analysis is being conducted for, is responsible for performing
     traffic analysis as described within paragraph 1.3. At the end of the RADAY, the MNCS
     will collect the following information for the previous RADAY:
        1.2.1.1. ALE Data. Tally all ALE data for each global STN:
            1.2.1.1.1. Total of links with all ground STNs and other global STNs combined.
            1.2.1.1.2. Total of links with only other global STNs.
            1.2.1.1.3. Total of links with ACFT.
            1.2.1.1.4. Total of PREPRO ZAF‟s (A.K.A. ALE Phone Patches).
            1.2.1.1.5. Total of AMD directly dialed ZAF‟s.
            1.2.1.1.6. Total of operator-assisted ALE ZAF‟s.
            1.2.1.1.7. Tally all links to all STNs combined, from each of the following ACFT:
               1.2.1.1.7.1. C-5
               1.2.1.1.7.2. C-9
               1.2.1.1.7.3. C-17
               1.2.1.1.7.4. C-141
               1.2.1.1.7.5. KC-10
               1.2.1.1.7.6. KC-135
               1.2.1.1.7.7. SAM
AMCI33-103 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   3


      1.2.1.2. ZAF total of each STN. Tally all non-ALE ZAF‟s, for each global STN, that
      began within the RADAY for which traffic analysis is being conducted for.
      1.2.1.3. FOX’s. Tally all FOX‟s for the entire RADAY.
      1.2.1.4. EAM’s. Tally all EAM‟s for the entire RADAY.
      1.2.1.5. ZAF total of entire HFGCS system. Tally all non-ALE ZAF‟s, of all the
      global STNs combined, for the entire RADAY.
      1.2.1.6. OEF/OIF traffic from JDG. Tally the total of FOX‟s, ZAF‟s, and all radio
      contacts (CTC), individually, for the Diego Garcia global STN.
      1.2.1.7. EAM & FOX totals in 3-hour increments. Tally the total of EAM‟s and
      FOX‟s, separately, for the following Zulu (Z) time periods.
          1.2.1.7.1. 0000Z-0259Z
          1.2.1.7.2. 0300Z-0559Z
          1.2.1.7.3. 0600Z-0859Z
          1.2.1.7.4. 0900Z-1159Z
          1.2.1.7.5. 1200Z-1459Z
          1.2.1.7.6. 1500Z-1759Z
          1.2.1.7.7. 1800Z-2059Z
          1.2.1.7.8. 2100Z-2359Z
      1.2.1.8. Mission support. Tally the total number of missions supported for each user
      (e.g. count the amount of P-1 Mystic Star missions supported, AFSPC missions, Navy
      missions, and the total number of instances that HF data support was provided to a user)
   1.2.2. HFGCS Network Control Station: The control station that is not the MNCS, for the
   RADAY that traffic analysis is being conducted for, is responsible for relaying the
   information pertaining to the stations they are in charge of no later than (NLT) within the
   first hour of the new RADAY (NLT 0059Z) to the NCS that is performing traffic analysis.
   The contact information for both HFGCS control stations is located on the HFGCS CoP site.
   Go to https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-SC-
   MC-15. Once logged into the HFGCS CoP open the “Org Charts/Station contact list”
   folder.
1.3. Performing Traffic Analysis. Note: Traffic analysis must be complete prior to the end
of the NCS’s local duty day (2400L). Otherwise, a system administrator must change the
OS’s date to that of the specific RADAY in which traffic analysis is being conducted.
   1.3.1. Begin traffic analysis immediately after the RADAY has ended. Follow the
   instructions in all subparagraphs and gather the data mentioned in paragraphs 1.1 & 1.2.1 in
   order to complete the Traffic Analysis Worksheet and the Metrics spreadsheet:
      1.3.1.1. Collect all HF Radio Facility Contact and Phone Patch Records, AF Form 3655,
      used for the previous RADAY.

    1.3.1.2. Collect all EAMs printed from the Strategic Automated Co mmand and Control
    System (SACCS) or manually typed or written on an Emergency Action Message, AF
    IMT 3654, processed for the previous RADAY.
    1.3.1.3. Collect all HF Radio Facility Foxtrot Message Blanks, AF Form 3656, processed
    for the previous RADAY.
    1.3.1.4. Collect all activity logs, from all global stations, for the previous RADAY.
    Acquire these activity logs by performing the following functions:
       1.3.1.4.1. Retrieve them from the log file server (NOTE: Some log files‟ upload to
       the file server are delayed up to 30-45 minutes; Waiting to download the files until
       0045Z, may reduce troubleshooting efforts.):
           1.3.1.4.1.1. Using a Non-secured Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET)
           Government Information System (GIS) with access to the location in which the
           activity logs and other traffic analysis files are stored on, open a web browser and
           go to the following Universal Resource Locator (URL) address:
              1.3.1.4.1.1.1. PRIMARY: https://logfiles1.hfgcs.amc.af.mil/logfiles
              1.3.1.4.1.1.2. ALTERNATE: https://logfiles2.hfgcs.amc.af.mil/logfiles
              1.3.1.4.1.1.3. If a message is displayed saying “There is a problem with this
              website's security certificate.”, select the option that says “Continue to this
              website (not recommended).”.
              1.3.1.4.1.1.4. If a message is displayed saying “The current webpage is trying
              to open a site in your Trused Sites list. Do you want to allow this?” Click
              “Yes”.
           1.3.1.4.1.2. A dialog box will eventually appear. Enter the following information
           into their correlating fields:
              1.3.1.4.1.2.1. USER NAME: HFGCS\user.name
                1.3.1.4.1.2.1.1. Replace “user.name” with your HFGCS domain user id
                (usually, firstname.lastname). Ensure after the acronym „HFGCS‟, a
                backslash “\”is used, not a forward slash “/”.
              1.3.1.4.1.2.2. PASSWORD: enter your HFGCS domain password
           1.3.1.4.1.3. Once logged on, select your desired STN. NOTE: IKF, NCS,
           NCS1, NCS2, WEBCALL1, and WEBCALL2 DO NOT apply to traffic analysis.
           1.3.1.4.1.4. In the STN‟s log file directory, download the ZIP file
           (MM_DD_YY.ZIP) that has the name that corresponds to the RADAY in which
           traffic analysis is being conducted for. Note: For instructions on how to
           download a file please consult your OS‟s or other software manuals. Or, seek
           guidance from your Communications Focal Point (CFP; AKA the „Help Desk‟).
           This is the same on how to use any software you may use to handle compressed
           files (e.g. ZIP files).
           1.3.1.4.1.5. Open the ZIP file.
AMCI33-103 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                    5


           1.3.1.4.1.6. When viewing the contents of the ZIP file, select the activity lo g with
           the name that correlates to the correct RADAY (MM_DD_YY.act), indicated by
           the file name ending in „.act‟. You may have to view the properties of each file to
           distinguish the difference between the files. The keywords you are looking for
           are „file type; ACT file‟. NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU SELECT THE
           ACTIVITY LOG THAT HAS THE FILE NAME THAT CORRESPONDS
           TO THE RELEVEANT RADAY.
              1.3.1.4.1.6.1. To enable viewing all file extensions in Microsoft (MS)
              Windows, open the control panel, open „Folder Options‟, select the „View‟
              tab, uncheck „Hide extensions for known file types‟, uncheck „Remember
              each folder‟s view settings‟, click „Apply‟, and then click „Ok‟.
           1.3.1.4.1.7. Extract the ACT file to its STN‟s folder. Normally, this is
           C:\STATIONS\XXX , where XXX is the correlating STN‟s ALE address. (e.g.
           Elmendorf global STN‟s ALE address is AED). NOTE: THIS LOCATION
           CAN ONLY BE CHANGED BY EDITING THE SOURCE CODE (SEE
           CHAPTER 2). To see a list of ALE addresses go to paragraph 1.3.1.6.1
           1.3.1.4.1.8. Return to the „Parent Directory‟ and repeat the tasks in paragraphs
           1.3.1.4.1.3. through 1.3.1.4.1.7. for the remaining STN‟s. Note: It may be
           necessary to leave the browser open and logged into the log file server, in order to
           aid in troubleshooting.
           1.3.1.4.1.9. IF AN ACT FILE IS MISSING, DO NOT PUT ANOTHER
           STN’S IN ITS PLACE OR CREATE A FICTICIOUS ACT FILE IN ITS
           PLACE, EVER. If a log is missing, complete the following:
              1.3.1.4.1.9.1. File an Incident Report (IR) with maintenance personnel.
              1.3.1.4.1.9.2. Follow the instructions in paragraph 1.3.1.4.2. or 1.3.1.4.3.
        1.3.1.4.2. Use the CCMS‟s „file maintenance‟ capability to backup the desired
        activity log:
           1.3.1.4.2.1. Acquire access to CCMS located on „Any Console‟ and connect to
           „Any Station‟, regardless of which STN‟s log file you are seeking.
           1.3.1.4.2.2. In the menu bar, select „Sys Mgmt‟, select „File Maintenance‟ sub-
           menu, and then select „Activity‟. A dialog box titled „Activity Log File
           Maintenance‟ will appear.
           1.3.1.4.2.3. In the „Location‟ field, select the desired STN. Wait for the CCMS
           to connect to the STN‟s database and retrieve the list of stored ACT files.
           1.3.1.4.2.4. In the „System Files‟ field, select the ACT file that has the name that
           corresponds with the RADAY in which traffic analysis is being conducted for
           (MM_DD_YY.ACT).
           1.3.1.4.2.5. In the „Backup Disk‟ field, select the „A: (ZIP)‟ radio button.
           1.3.1.4.2.6. Confirm that there is a blank formatted floppy disk inserted into the
           floppy drive.
6                                                     AMCI33-103 20 OCTOBER 2011


      1.3.1.4.2.7. Click the „Backup‟ button. A dialog box titled „File Backup Check‟
      should appear. Click the „Ok‟ button in this box.
      1.3.1.4.2.8. View the contents of the compressed ZIP file („filename‟.ZIP),
      located on the floppy disk, and confirm that the correct ACT file was successfully
      backed up. Repeat the instructions provided in paragraphs 1.3.1.4.2.1. through
      1.3.1.4.2.8. for all remaining STNs that were missing the necessary ACT file.
      1.3.1.4.2.9. Using the same NIPRNET GIS mentioned in paragraph 2.1.1.2,
      extract the ACT file(s) from the ZIP file(s) to the corresponding STN(s) folder(s),
      as described in paragraph 2.1.1.2.
         1.3.1.4.2.9.1. If that GIS does not have a properly functioning floppy drive,
         use another GIS to E-mail the ACT file(s) to a mailbox that can be accessed
         from the GIS that is being used to conduct traffic analysis. Note: Some
         government Exchange servers will not permit ZIP files to be sent or received.
    1.3.1.4.3. IN THE EVENT THE CCMS’s FILE MAINTENANCE
    CAPABILITY IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, manually locate and save
    the log files by performing the following tasks:
      1.3.1.4.3.1. Acquire access to CCMS located on „Any Console‟ and connect to
      „Any Station‟, regardless of which STN‟s log file you are seeking.
      1.3.1.4.3.2. In the menu bar, select „Sys Mgmt‟, select „Reports‟ sub-menu, and
      then select „Activity Log‟.
      1.3.1.4.3.3. In the „Activity Log Files Report‟ dialog box, select the desired STN
      in the „Location:‟ field, select the desired activity log (MM_DD_YY.act) in the
      „System Files‟ field, and then click view.
      1.3.1.4.3.4. Allow the system time to retrieve the log. When the log opens, save
      it to the desktop, using the „file-save-as‟ function. All efforts must be made to
      ensure you do not save the file as a Word or notepad document, do not c hange the
      file extension (file name ending in „.ACT‟), and do not change the contents of the
      file in any way.
         1.3.1.4.3.4.1. The alternative way to save the file is by using the following
         method:
           1.3.1.4.3.4.1.1. Minimize everything to the desktop (a keyboard shortcut is
           [windows key] + D). You should now be able to view the contents of the
           desktop.
           1.3.1.4.3.4.1.2. Open „My Computer‟ in order to view all storage devices.
           1.3.1.4.3.4.1.3. Open the „Apps‟ drive. This should be the „D:\‟ drive.
           1.3.1.4.3.4.1.4. Open the „temp‟ folder.
           1.3.1.4.3.4.1.5. „Right-click‟ the proper ACT file and then select „copy‟
           from the context menu. Note: If you cannot view the ACT file, in addition
           to following the directions in paragraph 1.3.1.4.1.6.1 Select the radio button
           to „Show hidden files and folders‟ and uncheck „Hide protected operating
AMCI33-103 20 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     7


                  system files‟.
                  1.3.1.4.3.4.1.6. Return to the desktop, „right-click‟ in an empty area, and
                  select „paste‟ from the context menu.
                  1.3.1.4.3.4.1.7. Once the ACT file has finished copying, „right-click‟ on it,
                  select the „Winzip‟ sub-menu from the context menu, and then select “add
                  to:” „MM_DD_YY.ZIP‟. Wait for file compression to complete. There
                  should now be a new file on the desktop with the same name as the ACT
                  file, except it ends in „.ZIP‟. Note: You must attain proper authorization
                  (e.g. HFGCS System Manager and/or the Designated Approval
                  Authority (DAA)) prior to using a preapproved portable Hard Disk
                  Drive (NOTHING with flash-based storage). If written, non-refutable,
                  authorization is obtained, this and the next step may be skipped; then
                  copy the ACT file to the device.
                  1.3.1.4.3.4.1.8. Copy the ZIP file to a properly formatted floppy disk.
                  Repeat the instructions provided in paragraphs 1.3.1.4.3.4.1.1. through
                  1.3.1.4.3.4.1.8. for all remaining STNs that were missing the necessary ACT
                  file.
                  1.3.1.4.3.4.1.9. Using the same NIPRNET GIS mentioned in paragraph
                  1.3.1.4.1.1., extract the ACT file(s) from the ZIP file(s) to the corresponding
                  STN(s) folder(s), as described in paragraph 1.3.1.4.1.1.
                      1.3.1.4.3.4.1.9.1. If that GIS does not have a properly functioning
                      floppy drive, use another GIS to E-mail the ACT file(s) to a mailbox that
                      can be accessed from the GIS that is being used to conduct traffic
                      analysis. Note: Some government Exchange servers will not permit
                      ZIP files to be sent or received.
     1.3.1.5. Run the traffic analysis script file (e.g. Traffic Anal ysis.pl) or a compiled
     executable version of the script. This will produce a spread sheet, or CSV file, named
     „MM_DD_YY.CSV‟, which corresponds to the previous RADAY. This file will be
     created in the directory in which the actual script or executable file is located, not where
     shortcuts are located (e.g. if the script or executable is located in „C:\STATIONS‟ and
     there is a shortcut to it on the desktop, the CSV file will be created in „C: \STATIONS‟).
     Note: Count the total number of blocks of calculated data that correspond to a global
     STN‟s ALE information. If there are more or less than 13, delete the CSV file and
     confirm all instructions in paragraph 1.3.1.4 were followed accurately.
        1.3.1.5.1. For details regarding the traffic analysis script (commonly referred to as
        the „traffic analysis program‟), see chapter 2.
        1.3.1.5.2. If the CSV file is created prior to discovering a missing ACT file, delete
        the CSV file prior to correcting the issue and rerunning the traffic analysis script.
        Additionally, do not run the script more than once. Otherwise, the data will be
        appended to the bottom of the data that was created in the previous instance the script
        was run.

    1.3.1.6. Use the data from the CSV file to manually fill out the traffic analysis
    worksheet. The ALE data is grouped by STN on the CSV file. However, sometimes an
    unknown error will cause the name of a STN to be altered. Only the following two
    instances should be ignored, as the calculated data is accurate.
       1.3.1.6.1. Sometimes the name of a STN is followed by „SPR‟ on the CSV file (e.g.
       ADWSPR). The data for that STN is still accurate and is to be used.
       1.3.1.6.2. Sometimes the name of a STN is substituted in the place of other STNs
       that follow the first instance of the copied STN‟s name. However, you will notice the
       values for the calculated data will all differ from every section of data that the STN‟s
       name was substituted for. Each block of data applies to one of the global STNs in
       alphabetical order of their ALE address, regardless of what STN is identified as
       the owner. (For example: ADW is the first STN, if the next block of data says it too
       is also ADW‟s information, but the values are different, then the second block of data
       belongs to AED. OR: If all blocks of data has ADW or ADWSPR identified as the
       owner, but there are 13 blocks of data, all with varying calculated data, then each
       block of data applies to one of the global STNs in alphabetical order of their ALE
       address.) The following is the alphabetical listing of the global STNs‟ ALE
       addresses:
           1.3.1.6.2.1. ADW = ANDREWS
           1.3.1.6.2.2. AED = ELMENDORF
           1.3.1.6.2.3. CRO = CROUGHTON
           1.3.1.6.2.4. GUA = GUAM (AKA ANDERSON)
           1.3.1.6.2.5. HAW = ASCENSION
           1.3.1.6.2.6. HIK = HICKAM
           1.3.1.6.2.7. ICZ = SIGONELLA
           1.3.1.6.2.8. JDG = DIEGO GARCIA
           1.3.1.6.2.9. JNR = PUERTO RICO (AKA SALINAS)
           1.3.1.6.2.10. JTY= YOKOTA
           1.3.1.6.2.11. MCC = MCCLELLAN (AKA WEST COAST)
           1.3.1.6.2.12. OFF = OFFUTT
           1.3.1.6.2.13. PLA = LAJES
    1.3.1.7. Use the filled out worksheet to aid in transcribing the data to the weekly metrics
    and the monthly/annual metrics. Normally, this is C:\STATIONS\#METRICS\YYYY\##
    MMM\, where „YYYY‟ is the correlating year and „## MMM‟ is the two digit month
    followed by a space and the three letter abbreviation of the month (e.g.
    C:\STATIONS\#METRICS\2010\06 JUN\). NOTE: THIS LOCATION CAN BE
    CHANGED AND WAS CREATED FOR CONVIENIENCE ONLY.
    1.3.1.8. Input the information from paragraphs 1.2.1.5. and 1.2.1.7. into the CSA power
    point slideshow on the SIPRNET GIS.
