NATO classified information, which can be obtained from the US Central Registry in Room 1B889.

4                                                                          AFHOI31-2 1 APRIL 1998

    4.1. NATO classified material normally flows from the SR, through the CP, to user offices. If user
    offices wish to transmit or transfer NATO classified material, that material shall be passed to the CP
    or the SR for transmission. Subregistry personnel will make sure that the material is properly
    wrapped and distributed through the proper channels.
    4.2. NATO Restricted (NR) material may be mailed directly by a NATO control point or NATO user.
       4.2.1. Double wrap NR material to be mailed. Mark the sealed inner wrapper with the forwarding
       and return addresses and NR markings. If the package is to be pouched, the secured pouch may
       serve as the outer wrapping. For mailing, mark the outer wrapper with forwarding and return
       addresses, and the marking: “Postmaster: Do Not Forward, Return to Sender."
       4.2.2. When NR material is mailed to addresses within the US and its territories, or to Army Post
       Office (APO)/ Fleet Post Office (FPO) addresses, it may be mailed via US Postal Service (USPS)
       First Class Mail. When mailed to addresses outside the US or its territories, NR will be sent via
       USPS registered mail or NATO member nation postal service.
       4.2.3. Note that you may also send NR material as first-class mail using an APO, FPO or interna-
       tional (geographical) address.
       4.2.4. Ensure the addressee has a need to know and is aware of procedures for handling NATO
       material.
    4.3. NATO unclassified material may be mailed as is US unclassified mail. NATO unclassified
    material is released only to non-NATO organizations and individuals when such release would not be
    detrimental to the best interests of NATO.

5. Granting NATO Access. Commanders of NATO control points delegate the authority to the primary
and alternate control point officers to grant NATO access.
    5.1. NS access requires the individual posses a final US Secret clearance and be briefed according to
    USSAN Instruction 1-69.
    5.2. NATO Confidential access requires the equivalent US clearance and established need-to-know.
    5.3. NATO Unclassified or NR access does not require a formal briefing, but must meet guidelines
    outlined in paragraphs 4.2.2. and 4.3.1.

6. Extraction Guidelines:
    6.1. Extract NATO information to allow individuals without NATO access to have limited access to
    information directly related to their assigned duties.
       6.1.1. The extracted information must be limited to the minimal amount required for mission
       accomplishment.
       6.1.2. Access to extracted information does not require a NATO access briefing.
    6.2. Apply US classification markings to pages containing extracted NATO classified information
    based on the classification of the page or portion from which the NATO information was extracted.
    6.3. US classified documents containing extracted NATO classified information shall be conspicu-
    ously marked on the cover or first page: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO (classification)
    INFORMATION.
AFHOI31-2 1 APRIL 1998                                                                                   5

      6.3.1. Show source of classification, that is, the source documents from which the classification is
      derived. If the classification is derived from more than one source, add the phrase “multiple
      sources” and keep the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the document.
      6.3.2. Show the organization and standard office symbol of the originator of the derivative docu-
      ments.

      6.4.1. Show the overall US classification at the top and bottom of each page.
      6.4.2. Refer to the following examples of equivalent US classifications:

NATO Secret ATOMAL                        Secret-Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data
NATO Confidential ATOMAL                  Confidential-Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data
COSMIC Top Secret                         Top Secret

NATO Restricted                           None
NATO Unclassified                         Unclassified

7. Destruction Guidelines:
   7.1. Annotate NS destruction on AF Form 310.
      7.1.1. For NS material, obtain signatures of two appropriately cleared and briefed persons

      8.1.1. Couriers must ensure that the material is kept in a sealed container until reaching their des-
      tination.
      8.1.2. Official couriers are not required for hand carrying NATO Unclassified material.

6                                                                         AFHOI31-2 1 APRIL 1998

       8.1.4. Courier destination must be specified. Individuals must read and sign courier instructions
       (USSAN 1-69).
    8.2. When hand-carrying NATO material internationally, use these guidelines:
       8.2.1. Official courier authorization is not required for international hand-carrying of NATO
       Unclassified material.
       8.2.2. Couriers hand-carrying NATO classified material internationally must be appointed in
       writing and possess a courier certificate as described in the USSAN Instruction 1-69.
           8.2.2.1. Upon return, the courier will report delivery or non-delivery of NATO material, and
           shall produce signed receipts for the delivered NATO material.
           8.2.2.2. For accountable purposes, the office which provided the NATO material must review
           signed receipts for all NATO classified material delivered against the list of materials dis-
           patched.

9. Reproduction Procedures. Reproduce NATO classified material only when it is essential to mission
accomplishment.
    9.1. NS reproduced documents must bear copy numbers as do the original documents. Copies shall
    reflect appropriate copy numbers.
       9.1.1. When a NATO user reproduces a NATO Secret document, ensure he or she provides a
       signed AF Form 310 to the NATO control point.
       9.1.2. When applying copy numbers to reproduced material, identify the office which reproduced
       the document, the copy number, the total number of copies reproduced, and the copy number of
       the original document. Example: 11 CS/SCSRAS reproduced four copies of a document with the
       original copy number being 116. The first reproduced copy would be 11 CS/SCSRAS Repro CY#
       1 of 4 CYs of CY #116. The second copy would be 11 CS/SCSRAS Repro CY# 2 of 4 CYs of CY
       #116, etc.
    9.2. NATO Confidential material requires control numbers on reproduced copies when required by
    the originator.
    9.3. NR material and below does not require control numbers.

10. Requisitioning Procedures:
    10.1. Process written requests for NATO documents through your NATO control point.
    10.2. Requests should contain short titles and file number; e.g., 4ATAF 1120.02/SHLOP/S5202/85
    and classification of document. It is important that the date of the desired document be provided as
    well.

11. Forms Prescribed:
    11.1. AF Form 310, Document Control Receipt.
AFHOI31-2 1 APRIL 1998                                        7
