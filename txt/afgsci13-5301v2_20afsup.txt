This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 13-530,
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Nuclear Operations and Air Force Global Strike
Command Instruction (AFGSC) 13-5301 Vol 2, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting
(REACT) Crew Standardization and Evaluation. The AFGSCI is published word-for-word
without editorial review. This supplement describes Twentieth Air Force (20 AF) procedures for
use in conjunction with the basic AFGSCI. Refer recommended changes and questions about
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through
appropriate publications/forms managers.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This rewrite does not change the content of the 20AF supplement. Its purpose is to implement
administrative corrections and to convert it to a stand-alone supplement.
1.3.2. All guidance and clarification requests must be submitted in signed memorandum format
and requested by senior crews or higher authority.
 2                                             AFGSCI13-5301V2_20AFSUP 11 JULY 2013


2.3.6. Requalification evaluations must be completed within 15-calendar days after completion
of individual training.
2.5.1.4. As a minimum, accomplish a random review of individual technical orders (for those
going on alert) in a particular squadron at mission planning every 6 months. This may be a
single squadron or multiple squadrons in the group.
3.1.1.1. (Added) Senior Crew evaluators will develop and execute the evaluator training
program and at a minimum will include items listed in paragraph 3.2.1. This training must be
documented and will include names, dates and topics instructed. Documentation will be
maintained for 1 year.
3.3.3.1. (Added) Evaluators may administer evaluations in the environment for which they are
certified, prior to any observation or certification for the remaining environment.
3.4. OG/CC appoints Senior Crew evaluators and notifies 20 AF/A3 via memorandum as soon
as possible.
3.4.4. Once waiver is approved, a replacement Senior Crew member will be appointed and 20
AF/A3 will be notified.
3.6.2.2. Annual observations will not be delegated lower than the Senior Crew level.
4.2.9. (Added) Before conducting an evaluation, evaluators must:
4.2.9.1. (Added) Prepare and review the selected script and associated materials.
4.2.9.2. (Added) Initiate an evaluation worksheet or locally generated worksheet for each crew
member to be checked. If requested by 20 AF/A3NV, the unit will provide a worksheet
containing crew member information for each crew member evaluated during 20 AF/A3NV
conducted unit evaluations.
4.2.9.3. (Added) Review the evaluatees’ records to ensure all Supplemental Training (ST) has
been accomplished and the evaluatees meet the requirements for evaluation.
4.2.9.4. (Added) Determine the ACP/SCP status of the crew.
4.2.9.5. (Added) Properly configure the MPT IAW the script and evaluator setup guide, as
applicable.
4.3. Evaluation scripts will be technically accurate in accordance with technical orders and
applicable directives.
4.3.3.3. (Added) If script requires crew to perform LCC Inspections or LCC Communication
Inspections, evaluators will provide stimuli requiring evaluatee to accomplish these checklists.
4.3.4.2. (Added) If a script allows the SCP to direct configuration actions, allow the crew to
direct all actions.
4.3.4.2.1. (Added) If directed actions were correct, but were directed to LCCs not designated
within the script, direct the SCP to accomplish specific actions (e.g. “For evaluation purposes,
accomplish the PLC-B, Echo will accomplish the enable.”) This method is preferred when the
directed actions are required JPRs.
4.3.4.2.2. (Added) If directed actions were not correct, follow directed actions and assess
errors accordingly.
AFGSCI13-5301V2_20AFSUP 11 JULY 2013                                                             3


4.3.9.1.3. (Added) Procedural entering arguments specified in technical orders and other
directives must not be "masked." "Masking" means using one element of status to suppress
another element of status to the extent that the second element of status is not easily detectable.
4.3.11.1. (Added) Scripts will measure performance in weapon system operation in a
peacetime environment and the majority of EWO performances in a wartime environment. The
early portion of the ride will consist primarily of weapon system events and may contain some
EWO preparation messages. This segment will transition into a wartime environment where the
primary focus is EWO. Expected weapon system effects (e.g., power and communications
losses, blast valves closing, etc.) should occur in this portion of the ride. The ride must have
opportunities for crews to demonstrate proper prioritization. Clock advances will be used to
clean up extraneous status.
4.3.15. (Added) On-line scripts must utilize a system to track changes made throughout the
scripts effective time. Units will include a List of Effective pages tracking all changes to the
script after publication date.
4.3.16. (Added) Units will number and date scripts to facilitate control and use.
4.4.5.1. (Added) Outside agencies will not prompt, challenge, or confirm any crew actions in
the MPT. Outside agencies will only provide guidance as directed by technical orders and
applicable directives.
4.4.5.2. (Added) The intent of the MPT evaluation is to assess the proficiency of the MCC
under evaluation and not the responses of outside agencies. If a crew asks another agency a
question, the response should be consistent with their technical orders or any other applicable
directives.
4.4.5.3. (Added) If the crew under evaluation queries an agency with a question yet has the
ability to answer the posed question from the resources within their LCC, evaluators will instruct
the crew to follow appropriate technical data.
4.5.1.1. (Added) Introducing Fire Status. Fire status will be presented using a status card in
accordance with paragraph 4.5.2.1. or a brief. When one piece of equipment is on fire, the status
card/brief will state, “You note smoke/heat coming from the indicated piece of equipment,
personal safety is not in jeopardy.” The evaluator must outline the affected area twice and
ensure the MCC is in position to observe the act. The level A TEPS begins upon completion of
outlining the affected area the second time. In the event the MCC does not respond to the fire
indications, or takes incorrect isolation actions, do not present additional status. Original
indications will remain present and unchanged. If the MCCM is about to interact with the
affected piece of equipment and is not wearing gloves, brief “You sense heat.” If smoke or heat
is coming from several pieces of equipment (e.g. smoke coming from the base of all four shock
isolators) the card/brief will state “You note smoke/heat coming from the base of all four shock
isolators, personal safety is not in jeopardy.” At no time should the status card or brief identify
by name a single piece of equipment (e.g. you note smoke/heat coming from the motor
generator).
4.5.1.2. (Added) NUDET Ground Burst/Near Miss Weapon System Indications.
4.5.1.2.1. (Added) LCC Status. Dial lines, SACCS, VHF, UHF MILSTAR, SCC and EWO 1
will be down. HVC and EWO 2 will remain up as long as there is interconnectivity within the
 4                                              AFGSCI13-5301V2_20AFSUP 11 JULY 2013


squadron or squadrons; however, both HVC and EWO 2 may be presented as
impaired/inoperative within the constraints listed in AFGSCI 13-5301v 4. UHF radio may be
presented up or down based on scenario requirements. EHF MILSTAR and VLF will be
operational. There should be a loss of commercial power with all associated indications. The
LCC may transition to diesel operation or remain on batteries depending on the scenario. [1] The
LCC will experience an LOPP and the diesel will not start.< [3, 5] LCEB blast valves should
close then reopen after the overpressure is no longer detected (approximately 20 minutes).<
MIIDS will either be in access or alarmed, depending on whether topside personnel were
evacuated to the tunnel junction/LCEB. The WSP will experience a Nuclear Event Detected
CIRCUMVENTION RESTART. Status indications on the WSCE VDU for destroyed LCCs
should include SLT VC # (where # is the timeslot of the destroyed LCC), LCC DOWN
indications, and no contact via HVC to isolated LCCs. These are scenario dependent. For
SACCS present Comm 1 and 2 lights on the SFU, line down indications, and KIV-7M ON LINE
LED blinking, FDX displayed, Channel 1 displayed IAW T.O. 21M-LGM30F-1-23, Figure 1-2.
4.5.1.2.2. (Added) LF Status. LF indications are dependent on missile launch and status
monitoring capability, seismic indication, and EMP status. Indications for an LF that has
launched are: CES, MSLA, DCBSY, LFNG, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5,
10, 26, 27, 28, and 29. For an LF that has not launched indications are (as appropriate for
previous sortie status): EN, SALRT, PGLV, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, GMR 2, 5, 26,
27, 28, and 29, and MOSR 42 will set and clear. The decision to have the sortie come up on the
diesel and report GMR 3 depends upon the scenario being simulated (support building destroyed
or not). If the LF diesel is simulated to be non-operational, present GMR 5 indications. LFs
may also be presented as LFDN. Destroyed LFs should be shown as LFDN.
4.5.1.3. (Added) Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP)/High Altitude Burst (HAB) Weapon System
Indications.
4.5.1.3.1. (Added) LCC Status. Dial lines, SACCS, VHF, UHF MILSTAR, SCC and EWO 1
will be down. HVC and EWO 2 will remain operational. UHF radio may be presented up or
down based on scenario requirements. EHF MILSTAR and VLF will be operational. The LCC
should experience a loss of primary power and may remain on batteries or transition to the diesel
depending on the scenario. [1] The LCC will experience an LOPP and the diesel will not start.<
MIIDS either will be in access or alarmed, depending on whether topside personnel were
evacuated to the tunnel junction/LCEB. The WSP and MMP radios will experience a Nuclear
Event Detected CIRCUMVENTION RESTART. For SACCS present Comm 1 and 2 lights on
the SFU, line down indications, and KIV-7M ONLINE blinking, FDX displayed, Channel 1
displayed, [PLCC] IAW TO 21M-LGM30F-1-23, Figure 1-2< [SCP] IAW script presentation.<
4.5.1.3.2. (Added) LF Status. LF indications are dependent on missile launch and status
monitoring capability, seismic indication, and EMP status. Indications for an LF that has
launched are: CES, MSLA, DCBSY, LFNG, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5,
10, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Indications for an LF that has not launched are: SALRT, MOSR 42 will
set and clear, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5, 26, 27, 28, and 29. LFs may also be presented
as LFDN. The decision to have the sortie transition to diesel and report GMR 3 depends upon
the scenario that is being simulated (LF diesel operational or not). If the LF diesel is simulated
to be non-operational, present GMR 5 indications.
AFGSCI13-5301V2_20AFSUP 11 JULY 2013                                                             5


4.5.2.1. (Added) When introducing information via status card, clearly state, “I have a status
card for the crew”, read the card out loud and place the card face up on the console between the
MCCC and DMCCC. If a level A TEPS applies, start the time upon completion of reading the
status card.
4.5.3. (Added) IPD Modem. Units will use W10 to program the IPD Modem not present for
PLCC crews. SCP crews will have an IPD Modem present.
4.5.4. (Added) Squadron Configuration Actions. Do not present any squadron configuration
actions until the MCC has initiated on their own configuration actions unless it is necessary for
proper presentation of a scenario (i.e. Pre-Launch Sequence prior to a PLC-B Stack). Do not
present blocks containing PLCAs or PLSQ within 10 seconds of Initial Commit Time (ICT).
However, it is permissible to program multiple PLCAs and/or PLSQ in the same block. If an
MCC immediately key turns after accomplishing configuration actions and the MPT does not
provide proper indications, brief proper indications and present the appropriate blocks to provide
positive launch indications. Any configuration blocks not presented prior to key turn do not need
to be presented after key turn unless they are necessary to provide proper launch indications.
4.5.5. (Added) Malfunctions Affecting Crew Performance. A malfunction affecting a crew’s
performance warrants a suspension of the evaluation and the MCC should be backed out of the
MPT. Evaluators should exercise sound professional judgment at all times. For example, during
the evaluation the MCC receives an Operator Input Device (OID) fault, which they did not
appear to cause. Once noticed by the MCC, the evaluators should brief “Disregard the OID
Fault,” and correct the status at the next scheduled break. In this instance, exiting the crew from
the MPT to correct a minor discrepancy may be more distracting than the indication itself. In a
second example, the WSCE VDU freezes up on one side of the console during the last scripted
event of an evaluation. The MCC has received and seen all of the indications (e.g., LFOS at
LF02) and the only actions remaining are a launch report and call to MMOC. It is acceptable to
brief, “Disregard the frozen WSCE VDU screen” and allow the crew to finish the last two items.
A general rule is if the erroneous status will affect the MCCs actions during the course of the
evaluation, they must be backed out of the MPT and the malfunction corrected.
4.5.5.1. (Added) Backout Procedures. If incorrect status can be corrected with minimal
confusion to the crew, correct the status immediately and do not have the crew exit the MPT. If
the status cannot be easily corrected, accomplish the backout procedures described below.
4.5.5.1.1. (Added) Note the current clock time and brief the crew to cease their actions and exit
the MPT.
4.5.5.1.2. (Added) One evaluator will escort the crew out of the MPT and ensure they are kept
under observation at all times. Do not allow the crew to discuss the evaluation. Limit the crew’s
contact with outside personnel to the greatest extent possible.
4.5.5.1.3. (Added) Correct status as expeditiously as possible.
4.5.5.1.4. (Added) When the status has been corrected, return crew to the MPT. Do not allow
them to accomplish any actions at this time.
4.5.5.1.5. (Added) Brief the crew on any configuration changes to the MPT, to include any
status that could not be reconstructed.

4.5.5.1.6. (Added) Brief the crew on all major events that have been accomplished and where
they are holding at this time.
4.5.5.1.7. (Added) Ensure the crew fully understands all status.
4.5.5.1.8. (Added) Hack the clock and restart evaluation presentation.
4.5.5.2. (Added) If numerous MPT malfunctions occur during the course of an evaluation, the
evaluators may want to consider terminating the evaluation earlier than the scripted scenario.
Before deviating from the approved scripted scenario, the evaluators must consider the
following:
4.5.5.2.1. (Added)   Determine if there is sufficient JPR task coverage to warrant a valid
evaluation.
4.5.5.2.2. (Added) Determine which JPRs would be omitted from the scenario by terminating
early.
4.5.5.2.3. (Added) Determine how long the MPT back out and reconfiguration will last.
Comparisons shall include approximate time for MPT back out, and number of MPT back outs
versus remaining scripted scenario time.
4.6.1.1. (Added) SACCS Status. Initial in-briefs for MPT evaluations must include the fact
that the MPT is configured as a HUTE, even for SCP crews due to MPT configuration. All
crews will receive indications in accordance with the actual SACCS configuration for the
scripted LCC location regardless of whether they are an SCP or PLCC crew.
4.6.3.1.1. (Added) Use the following verbiage as a guide for evaluation breaks, between script
events (e.g., clock advances), and for termination: "Are you satisfied all crew actions are
complete?” When the crew answers affirmatively, state "We will advance the clock to,”
“Standby for a status update,” or "Terminate," as applicable.
4.7.5. (Added) Ensure the MPT is returned to its baseline configuration upon completion of the
evaluation, to include resetting switches and cleaning documents.
4.8.3.1. (Added) If the evaluator desires to have the crew accomplish a task not required by the
actual situation, he/she should clearly identify this desire to the crew. Keep simulated problems
to a minimum consistent with evaluation requirements. Do not simulate performance Foxtrot
tasks in the operational environment.
5.1.6. Formal requests must include all information in Attachments 3 and 4 of this document.
5.2.2.2.1. (Added) In this case, do not advance the clock until it is obvious the crew is no
longer concerned with the situation, i.e. books have been closed and the MCC is awaiting new
status. At this time, ask the MCC “Are you satisfied all crew actions are complete?” If they
affirmatively answer “Yes” advance the clock, and award the appropriate error for the situation.
5.2.4.3.1. (Added) Example: A crew accomplishes LCC Equipment Shutdown when not
required due to an early reset attempt of the Emergency Fan Overload Rest (EFOR) button. A
critical error should be assessed at the moment the crew transitions to LCC Shutdown even if the
EFOR button was scripted to be un-resettable and LCC shutdown would have been required.
The important distinction is that at the time the crew made the decision to shutdown, it was not
required. Recovery however is possible if prior to releasing their command and control the crew
attempts reset of the EFOR again after waiting proper cool down time since their last attempt.

5.3.2.12.6. MCC is not required to brief location when declaring a security situation for
unexplained MIIDS alarm when declaring to their primary FSC over SCC line or MAF intercom.
6.1.5.1.1. (Added) Document field deviations using TEAMS generated Real World Deviation
(RWD) Worksheet.
