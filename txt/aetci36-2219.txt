Section A—Training Definitions and Planning

1. Use and Restrictions of Type 1 Training:
    1.1. AETC has Air Force-wide responsibility as the single manager of special training acquired (see
    AFI 36-2201, Volume 2, Air Force Training Program, Training Management) from civilian contrac-
    tors, educational institutions and, in some cases, other government agencies. Training of civilian
    employees in nongovernmental facilities is approved according to AFI 36-401, Employee Training
    and Development.
       1.1.1. Special contract training is a broader term than Type 1 training and includes formal or infor-
       mal type training. AETC Type 1 training is the formal training subset of this broader term. Refer-
       encing contract training as Type 1 is appropriate when training personnel at every level coordinate
       and take proper steps to formalize contract training to maintain proper management including but
       not limited to overseeing course design and documentation quality and completeness, creation of
       Type 1 course identifications (ID) and PDS codes (or parallel Type 1 formal AETC contract
       courses for flying training even though not signified with “1” in the course ID), managing sched-
       uling and allocations, resource issues, and proper student accounting and cost information. A good
       rule of thumb to determine whether contract training should be Type 1 training is to determine if
       the AF member should receive “formal” credit in the member’s official AF record for this training.
       In addition, ask the question, could a commander benefit from knowing a member has training on
       this system, task or skill in the member’s education and training profile?
       1.1.2. Conduct Type 1 training at a contractor's location or designated site under the control of
       AETC or another major command (MAJCOM). The training may cover technical, flying, or other
       kinds of training. This is often formal training of a one-time or limited nature contracted with
       civilian industrial or educational institutions and includes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
       courses. Training is normally used to train selected personnel to operate and maintain new sys-
       tems; often the personnel in training are the initial cadre and AETC instructors who, upon comple-
       tion of Type 1 Training, return to their technical TRW/TRG and develop other AETC formal
       courses. It may also feed the initial cadre of skilled maintenance, aircrew, system operator, or other
       type personnel required by MAJCOM or foreign militaries. However, Type 1 training will some-
       times apply to training situations other than those of a one-time and limited nature to include for-
       mal contract training that is longer in duration, if this is deemed appropriate.
       1.1.3. Type 1 training will not be used to:
           1.1.3.1. Provide the type of professional qualification that results in a baccalaureate or higher
           degree.
           1.1.3.2. Provide maintenance training flight training as defined in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
           Equipment Maintenance Management.
           1.1.3.3. Provide informal training, defined in AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Ser-
           vices Management and Control, as a function of contractor engineering technical services
           (CETS) under the description of contractor field services (CFS).
           1.1.3.4. Serve as an initial skills or AFSC awarding course, but may be used as a train the
           trainer strategy to prepare for creating an initial skills course.
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                                5


   1.2. Type 1 training includes participation with industry (PWI) which is authorized for skilled and
   experienced personnel. (See paragraph 2.)
   1.3. Use Type 1 Training as follows:
      1.3.1. Establish contract-training courses:
          1.3.1.1. Until AETC instructors and/or other key personnel are trained.
          1.3.1.2. Until equipment and/or facilities are available for Air Force-conducted training.
          1.3.1.3. Only after satisfying less costly means of training requirements are exhausted.
          1.3.1.4. When training requirements do not warrant establishment of an Air Force training
          capability.
      1.3.2. To track training embedded in acquisition contracts.
      1.3.3. To conduct contract-training courses at Air Force installations when practical.
      1.3.4. Do not enter students into contract training before completion of contractual action by
      AETC.
      1.3.5. To schedule contract training for an 8-hour training day.
      1.3.6. To arrange training as directed by a foreign government.

2. Participation with Industry:
   2.1. PWI is a contract arrangement permitting skilled and experienced personnel to participate in a
   production plant, research and development, or engineering environment with selected contractor
   employees. The purpose of PWI is to allow the transfer of information, data, or techniques needed to
   qualify skilled or experienced personnel on system or subsystem equipment, components, test proce-
   dures, design factors, or system evolution.
   2.2. PWI consists of maintenance seminars or over-the-shoulder observations under control of the
   contractor. Contractors provide Air Force personnel access to equipment, data, techniques, or key
   employees to accomplish the training. PWI may also include the study of schematics, blueprints, etc.,
   without contract employee supervision. PWI should conduct a prearranged schedule according to an
   outline such as a course chart. (Note: PWI may consist of a no-cost training agreement that specifies
   the government and contractor's responsibilities). Enter student’s names into the Air Force system of
   record (Military Personnel Data System/Oracle Training Administrator (MilPDS/OTA); Defense Inte-
   grated Management Human Resource System/Enterprise Learning Management (DIMHRS/ ELM)
   upon implementation when formal documentation is required.

3. Management:
   3.1. Headquarters-managed programs are defense system programs, projects, or activities that have a
   TPM, HQ AETC/A3T, or training acquisition manager, HQ AETC/A5TO, assigned as the command
   point of contact (POC). This action officer (AO) is the designated individual responsible for success-
   ful implementation or monitoring of the program, project, or activity. Typically, use these efforts for a
   new acquisition or technology initiative that has not matured.
   3.2. Wing and/or group-managed programs are defense system programs, projects, or activities that a
   TRW assigns as the command POC. The TRW is delegated the responsibility of implementation or
6                                                                      AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


    monitoring. These efforts are most likely in support of a mature defense system or technology. Just as
    a headquarters AO coordinates with all impacted TRWs to integrate new defense system training
    requirements into existing AETC operations, the wing, and/or group training management personnel
    assigned responsibility for a specified system must account for impacts to all AETC operations and
    any impacts to customer commands.
    3.3. Programs managed by Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) are activities worked
    through a US Government agreement with a foreign government. AFSAT is the designated unit
    responsible for successful implementation or monitoring of all Air Force-provided international train-
    ing in these programs, to include special contract training services to foreign customers.

4. Responsibilities for Planning and Initiating Type 1 Training:
    4.1. HQ AETC/A5T Acquisition Manager:
       4.1.1. Works closely with the appropriate program office, Air Staff, owning command MAJCOM,
       and training managers (TM) to determine the need for factory or contractor training to provide the
       necessary skill sets for training on new weapon systems.
       4.1.2. Coordinates for tracking purposes with AETC TPMs and TRW and TRG TMs to channel
       special contract training and/or training embedded in contracts to AETC Type 1 training.
       4.1.3. Engages as early as possible, AETC TPMs and TRW and TRG TMs in the process to
       ensure excellent instructional design oversight and smooth transition from special contract train-
       ing to AETC Type 1 courses and eventually to other types of AETC formal courses.
    4.2. HQ AETC/A3T/A3R TPM:
       4.2.1. Coordinates with AETC acquisition managers and TMs to transition special contract train-
       ing to AETC Type 1 training.
       4.2.2. Ensures AETC Type 1 courses are properly managed and resourced (when resourcing falls
       under AETC).
       4.2.3. Establishes priorities for contract training as required and approves programs for imple-
       mentation or procurement. Coordinates on approval of initiating AETC Type 1 training with
       Career Field Manager (CFM) and TM when other types of formal training are not practical, avail-
       able, or timely for training needs.
    4.3. TRW and TRG TM:
       4.3.1. In context of career field tasking and upon coordination with TPM and CFM, initiates
       AETC Type 1 training when other types of formal training are not practical, available, or timely
       for training needs.
       4.3.2. Performs necessary training management functions to support tracking of Type 1 courses
       for training embedded in acquisition contracts.
    4.4. Flying Training Course Personnel:
       4.4.1. Coordinate with 19 AF/A3 in the planning phase to initiate and launch flying training
       whether graduate or undergraduate level.

6. Validating Requirements:
      6.1. AETC, 2 AF, and 19 AF evaluate requests and determine whether the training request may be
      provided without specific HQ USAF approval.
      6.2. When validating the special training request, AETC, AFSAT, 2 AF, 19 AF, or responsible wing
      and/or group reviews Air Force program documents and decides to screen other Air Force agencies
      for similar training requirements. Agencies submit their requirements through the Air Force training
      and education system of record (MilPDS/OTA or DIMHRS/ELM upon implementation) or Joint
      Security Assistance Training procedures if appropriate.
      6.3. AFSAT validates all security assistance-training requirements.

7. Course Numbers and Titles. Assign Air Force course number, title, and personnel data system (PDS)
code to each course according to education training and course announcements (ETCA) procedures.

8. Accommodation of Requirements:
      8.1. Forward training requirements through the training planning system (TPS) to the TRW selected
      to do or arrange for the training. If the training is accomplished by another government agency (Type
      5, 9, B, D), the requirement information is normally sent directly to that agency, with information cop-
      ies to the participating TRW or TRG selected to do or arrange for the training. AFSAT will manage the
      requirement if the training for international customers only.
8                                                                      AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


    8.2. A Type 1 Training program begins with a request for purchase package (RFPP) which is prepared
    according to Attachment 2. You may not need a RFPP if training is embedded in the initial acquisi-
    tion contract.
    8.3. For requirements on programs managed at AETC, AO will review the RFPP and support infor-
    mation for completeness and adequacy in meeting training requirements and either approve the RFPP
    or return it to the wing and/or group for revision. After approval, take follow-on action to implement
    the RFPP. This follow-on action includes issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) by the AETC con-
    tracting squadron.
    8.4. For requirements on systems or programs managed by designated wing and/or group, the TRW/
    TRG training manager will ensure RFPP and support information are complete and adequate to meet
    the training requirement. The TRW/TRG has approval authority for RFPPs supported with locally
    secured resources.
    8.5. When contractual arrangements for training are completed, the training manager prepares the
    training schedule and furnishes reporting instructions and allocation through established procedures.
    The TRW/TRG will normally conduct training evaluations of Type 1 training where applicable.
    8.6. When special training requirements involve foreign military sales, comply with AFI 16-105 (I),
    as appropriate.

Section D—Control Documents and Instructional Materials

11. Developing Contract Training. Minimize course documentation requirements where possible while
ensuring adequate training and contractor accountability. Develop contract training within the standards
and intent of Air Force instructional systems development process (AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Sys-
tem Development).

12. Responsibilities:
     12.1. HQ AETC/A3T/A3F/A3Z/A5T. Have command responsibilities with the lead command
     regarding the preparation, coordination, and acquisition of training data for AETC-managed pro-

     13.2. AETC Course. AETC course design and development software is restricted to AETC person-
     nel.

14. Instructional Materials:
     14.1. Technical Data. Technical Data (technical order [TO] source documents and preliminary TOs)
     developed under AFPD 21-3, Technical Orders, are used for training courses when possible. Use
     S1000D technical data for courses on appropriate systems (Global Hawk, F22, CSAR-X, and others
     as they migrate to the newer specification). FTWs, TRWs, and TRGs maintain awareness of technical
     data preparation efforts and initial contract action as prescribed in AETC publications. When avail-
     able, use these publications as the primary texts for training courses.
     14.2. FTWs, TRWs, and TRGs. Indicate in the RFPP that data developed under system and/or
     equipment contracts is available to the training contractor in preliminary or final manuscript form
     before the training starts. Use this data to also meet AETC requirements for audiovisual products,

   mation Security Program Management. Appropriate guidance regarding classified materials in Type 1
   training must be included in the RFPP (DD Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Clas-
   sification Specification, and Attachment 2).

Section E—Logistical Support

16. Evaluating Logistical Support. Review logistical support for Type 1 course contracts on a
case-by-case basis, with a focus on cost and mission accomplishment.

17. Responsibilities:
   17.1. HQ AETC/A3T and 2 AF. These offices provide guidance and assistance to TRWs and TRGs
   on the programming, acquisition, distribution, authorization, maintenance, and use of property
   required to support Type 1 training. 2 AF should evaluate requests for government-furnished property
   (GFP) and assist TRWs and TRGs in maintaining training equipment.
   17.2. HQ AETC/A3F/A3Z and 19 AF. These offices provide guidance and assistance to FTWs on
   the programming, acquisition, distribution, authorization, maintenance, and use of property required
   supporting special training. 19 AF should evaluate requests for government-furnished property (GFP)
   and assist FTWs in maintaining training equipment.
   17.3. Supply HQ AETC/A4RM:
       17.3.1. Provides command assistance on supply difficulties.
       17.3.2. Monitors and verifies availability of equipment and other logistics support for training
       programs.
   17.4. FTWs, TRWs, and TRGs:
       17.4.1. Identify, evaluate, and ensure timely logistic support of GFP, to include spare parts, main-
       tenance, and refurbishment, during and at the completion of training.

       17.4.3. Monitor all GFP placed on loan to contractors, including movements into and out of the
       contractor facilities, and its final disposition.
       17.4.4. Ensure all GFP required by contractors for use in Type 1 training conducted at Air Force
       bases are available and properly accounted for.
12                                                                      AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


        17.4.5. For wing and/or group-designated programs, provide necessary logistic support informa-
        tion to AETC to permit followup on logistics management actions.
     17.5. AFSAT. AFSAT is responsible for coordinating all training support equipment required for
     their international customer’s special contract training.

18. Use of GFP:
     18.1. AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, discusses associated risks acquiring
     GFP may have on a projected training implementation schedule.
     18.2. Hold quantities of GFP provided for support of special training to a minimum, consistent with
     training quality as specified by the approved course control documents. Wise selection and allocation
     of property from either stock assets or production contracts will ensure operational and production
     programs are not disrupted. For contract special training courses, contractor-controlled equipment
     assets are used to the extent economically feasible to minimize the requirements for GFP. GFP pro-
     vided to contractors must be consistent with the equipment use by operational units. GFP shipped to a
     training contractor must be in serviceable condition unless prior agreement is made between the con-
     tracting officer and the contractor for use of items in reparable condition.
NOTE: A caution to be observed in negotiating training contracts concerns the designation of GFP and
contractor-furnished property (CFP). When equipment from an acquisition contract still in production is
required for training, you must obtain authorization for use from the contracting officer on the acquisition
contract. You will usually obtain this on a rent-free, noninterference basis. Responsibility for delay must
be determined when the delay occurs. The failure of a contractor to perform on one contract, which affects
his or her ability to perform on another contract, is not necessarily a cause for monetary adjustment on the
second contract.
     18.3. Program specially designed training equipment, system hardware, and standard items on a
     timely basis. Consider the required equipment delivery dates and planned training start dates. Once
     training equipment requirements are known, contract actions will begin as required by the applicable
     acquisition activity.
     18.4. Priority for allocation of property from AETC base assets will be in the order listed below:
NOTE: Approval of AETC is required for any deviation.
        18.4.1. Type 1 training established under AFI 36-2201, Volume 2.
        18.4.2. Conversion training-by-training detachments (TD).
        18.4.3. Resident and/or nonresident career field courses.
        18.4.4. Follow-on training by TDs.
        18.4.5. Operational support.
     18.5. Consider the following when determining if base assets will be made available to support Type
     1 training.
        18.5.1. The length of the course as it applies to temporary loan of in-use base assets.
        18.5.2. The possibilities of equipment substitution or alternate instructional methods.
        18.5.3. The use of items on hand.
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                                13


      18.5.4. The possibility of joint use of critical items.

19. Equipment for Type 1 Training:
   19.1. GFP required in support of Type 1 training will authorize training as shown on AETC Form
   259, Government Furnished Equipment List, included in the approved training contract. The executed
   contract is the authorization for the required property. No government-owned resources, supplies, or
   other property will be provided the contractor unless specifically referenced in the AETC Form 259 in
   the contract.
   19.2. The property administrator designated by the office exercising administrative responsibility for
   the contract administers the accountability record for GFP furnished to a training contractor. When
   GFP is transferred from a contract training site to an Air Force activity, the appropriate supply activity
   assumes accountability for the property in compliance with AFI 10-601, Capabilities-Based Require-
   ments Development.
   19.3. Accountability for GFP used in support of Type 1 training conducted at an Air Force base will
   reside at that base. For this reason, attach AETC Form 259 to contracts covering the training to iden-
   tify property required by the contractor. Account for such property on unit property records under the
   custody of Air Force personnel.
   19.4. When contractors conduct training at the contractor plant or a military site and training requires
   access to equipment and/or automated data processing equipment (ADPE) (computer time), but the
   training contract does not include it as GFP to the training contract; the situation does not require a
   supply action. The wing and/or group resources management from the activity controlling the equip-
   ment shall obtain authority for the use of such equipment. Review these requirements and confirm
   availability as a part of the narrative evaluation of the contractor’s proposal. List items with an expla-
   nation of any related actions and availability status on AETC Form 259A, Government Furnished
   Technical Data List. Annotate the form to indicate that such items are not GFP and keep the form sep-
   arate from the GFP listing.

20. Equipment for Depot-Level Special Training:
   20.1. Equipment required to accomplish Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) depot-level mainte-
   nance training is programmed and furnished by the AFMC activity having the training requirement.
   AETC on-hand or programmed assets are made available, if possible, upon request of the AFMC
   activity.
   20.2. Supply and procurement actions to fill GFP requirements, that are not available from AETC or
   AFMC on-hand or due-in assets, are accomplished by the AFMC activity.
   20.3. AFSAT schedules security assistance depot-level training and equipment training at an AFMC
   depot.

21. Centrally Acquired Training Equipment:
   21.1. Logistics support of all centrally acquired training equipment is a lead and/or using command
   responsibility and must not be contracted for by AETC.
   21.2. Intermediate and organizational maintenance is provided through either contract or Air Force
   resources, depending on such factors as cost, parts, in-house capability, etc.
14                                                                      AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008

24. Facilities Owned by Another Government Agency. If training is conducted at a non-Air Force,
government-owned facility, arrangements for use of the facility or its modification are negotiated with the
agency by HQ USAF. In this case, AETC furnishes the necessary information to HQ USAF.

25. Facilities at Air Force Installations Other than AETC Training FTWs, TRWs, and/or TRGs. If
training is conducted at an Air Force installation other than an AETC wing and/or group, the responsible
wing and/or group negotiates the use of the facility and any modification or construction necessary.
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                                 15

A2.13. Off-the-Shelf Courses. When training is desired from a contractor who has a commercial train-
ing course based upon an established catalog or market price, sold in substantial quantity to the public,
and sole source is justified, the following steps are taken:
     A2.13.1. The TRW prepares and submits a limited RFPP with the following information included on
     AF IMT 9:
        A2.13.1.1. Recommended source with name and phone number of contact.
        A2.13.1.2. Sole source justification.
        A2.13.1.3. Estimated training costs (prices obtained from printed catalog or brochure).

        dates. (If available, furnish names of students.)
     A2.13.2. Attach a copy of the contractor's catalog or brochure to the AF IMT 9.
     A2.13.3. If a contractor's brochure is not available; take care in developing a course chart to prevent
     requirements from being placed on the contractor to provide training that is outside or beyond the
     scope of the commercial course. Any change to the commercial course would prohibit processing a
     limited RFPP.
     A2.13.4. In this limited RFPP, required documents include:
        A2.13.4.1. AF IMT 9.
        A2.13.4.2. Contractor brochure or AETC Form 449.
        A2.13.4.3. AETC Form 259 when GFP is required. Use the remainder of the RFPP as necessary.
        A2.13.4.4. AETC Form 255.

A2.14. Communications Sent to AETC CONS. Any communication on an RFPP addressed to AETC
CONS must reference the particular RFPP number.

                                              Attachment 3

                      PROCESSING TYPE 1 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. Purpose. This attachment addresses the procedures and responsibilities for establishing: (a) a fis-
cal year operating training program and (b) out-of-cycle individual requests. This is not applicable to
AFSAT.

A3.2. Management. Manage training requirements processing between HQ AETC and 2 AF, TRWs,
and TRGs with minimal HQ AETC/A2/A3 intervention. The exception will be requirements associated
with select programs managed at the headquarters.

A3.3. Fiscal Year Operating Programs. List procedures and responsibilities for establishing fiscal year
operating programs chronologically.
   A3.3.1. TRWs and TRGs receive, review, and validate requirements for training, using the guidance
   in AFI 36-2201, Volume 2. The review includes a comparison of the requirement with the following:
       A3.3.1.1. Proper identification of equipment and technical data products.
       A3.3.1.2. Description and scope of training.
       A3.3.1.3. Planned use of graduates.
       A3.3.1.4. Number of persons by category (officers, airmen, civilians) for whom training is
       required.
       A3.3.1.5. Date trained personnel are required and earliest date personnel will be available for
       training.
       A3.3.1.6. Prerequisite qualifications of personnel that need training.
       A3.3.1.7. Status of requirement (firm or estimated).
       A3.3.1.8. Consistency of the training requirement with the training plans.
   A3.3.2. TRWs and TRGs determine tentative method to satisfy validated training requirements.

A3.4. Procedures and Responsibilities for Processing Individual Requests:
   A3.4.1. TPS receives requirement through the AF System of Record (MilPDS/OTA or DIMHRS/
   ELM upon implementation) from MAJCOMs or agencies. TMs along with 2 AF and AETC validate
   requirements and schedule.
   A3.4.2. TRWs and TRGs receive, review, and validate firm individual requests, as appropriate. Other
   MAJCOMs may be queried as necessary to determine Air Force-wide total requirements for training
   similar to that in the special training request. (If the review of the Air Force programs implies that
   other Air Force agencies may also have similar training needs, the training directorate initiates screen-
   ing correspondence requesting that statements of training requirements be submitted according to AFI
   36-2201, Volume 2.)
30                                                                        AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


     A3.4.3. TRWs and TRGs use AETC and TRW records of past and current training programs to deter-
     mine if a training capability exists within or outside of AETC. If it is determined, that training should
     be provided by another government agency, the training request obtains the necessary training quotas.
     A3.4.4. 2 AF Programming assigns Air Force PDS codes for Type 1 training courses. TMs input the
     course data into TPS, 2 AF validates, and course data is transmitted from TPS to the AF System of
     Record (MilPDS/OTA or DIMHRS/ELM upon implementation) after TMs send AETC Form 179A,
     Course Training Schedule for Allocations, to the 2 AF program manager.
     A3.4.5. Training managers:
        A3.4.5.1. Use TPS to validate training requirements, enter course data, and request course PDS
        codes.
        A3.4.5.2. Submit AETC Forms 179A to program schedules in TPS.
        A3.4.5.3. Use TTMS to flow courses to TTMS Student Accounting and enter student statuses and
        grades. (Note: This requires training managers to be assigned dual roles in TTMS.)
     A3.4.6. The program managers at 2 AF process AETC Forms 179A and flow course schedules from
     TPS to the OTA or DIMHRS ELM upon implementation.
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                              31


                                             Attachment 4

                        ESTABLISHING TYPE 1 CONTRACT TRAINING

A4.1. Purpose. This attachment outlines the procedures for acquiring Type 1 Training.
   A4.1.1. AFSAT will coordinate special contract training RFPP actions with AETC CONS/LGCI
   using guidance appropriate to meet the intent of this attachment, but has no requirement to use spe-
   cific forms identified.

A4.2. Requirements. Normal lead times required between contracting officer's receipt of the RFPP until
contract award date, are as follows:
   A4.2.1. Sole source and competitive requirements estimated to cost $100K or less--60 days.
   A4.2.2. All other requirements estimated to exceed $100K to $25M--180 days.
   A4.2.3. All requirements estimated to exceed $25M--240 days.
   A4.2.4. Proper planning and preparation is necessary to get greater than $100K requirements on con-
   tract and effort on the contract underway before the end of the fiscal year. RFPPs must submit by 1
   January of the fiscal year. The above lead times cover only contract actions. Add course preparation
   time to contract lead-time to determine the earliest possible training start date. Contractors must show
   performance against the contract in the same fiscal year that award is made. This paragraph does not
   apply to Air Force Security Assistance Training.

A4.3. Procedures and Responsibilities for Acquiring Type 1 Training:
   A4.3.1. HQ AETC/A3T determines whether the training requirement relates to a program managed
   by AETC or managed by a designated wing and/or group, and whether the requirement can be pro-
   cessed routinely or must be handled under emergency procedures. AFSAT makes this determination
   for special contract training in its programs.
       A4.3.1.1. (For AETC-managed Programs) Routine requirements, to include number, title, PDS
       code, security data, and date for submission are normally referred to the wing and/or group for the
       development of the RFPP. Reserve emergency requirements for those instances when sufficient
       time does not remain to follow normal procedures.
       A4.3.1.2. (For wing and/or group-managed Programs) The TRW assigns training request to the
       appropriate wing and/or group training manager for preparation of the RFPP. Construction instruc-
       tions are in Attachment 2. If essential items are in error or omitted, advise the originator and
       return, if required, the RFPP to the wing and/or group with recommendations for reaccomplish-
       ment.
       A4.3.1.3. (For AFSAT-managed Programs) Normally, program training managers prepare request
       RFPPs. However, some training requests are delegated to the wing and/or group. Handle these
       requests as described below.
   A4.3.2. TRWs and TRGs establish and maintain a control register of RFPPs. Prepare and coordinate
   the RFPP according to this instruction and applicable training publication. If training is conducted on
   a military facility, determine and resolve the need for a support agreement. When necessary, include
   logistical support and security requirements.
32                                                                     AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


     A4.3.3. TRWs and TRGs provide input relative to technical data and equipment for the preparation of
     the initial AETC Form 259 and AETC Form 259A. Also, provide facility data (adequacy and avail-
     ability) for inclusion on AETC Form 407A.
        A4.3.3.1. For off-the-shelf courses, enter cost on AF IMT 9 and attach a copy of the contractor's
        catalog, brochure, or outline.
        A4.3.3.2. Forward a copy of the initial AETC Form 259 for each course, identifying projected
        anticipated GFP to HQ AETC/A4RM. Include on the AETC Form 259 previously allocated assets
        that can be relocated upon termination of a prior contract and used to satisfy the GFP requirement.
        Complete the AETC Form 259 on both sides if GFP is required. Include a negative statement in
        the RFPP narrative if GFP is not required.
     A4.3.4. The TRW or TRG consults its base’s system materiel management branch (mission support
     group) to review its requirement for logistic support and the proposed source of such support. When
     GFP is involved, the using MAJCOM’s provisioning activity is responsible for maintenance and pro-
     vides all pertinent contract numbers that cover maintenance and/or spare/repair parts support. Enter
     this information in part II, column III "Remarks" of AETC Form 259. Also, include confirmation of
     maintenance and spares support in part II, column III "Remarks" of the final AETC Form 259 and
     attach it to the wing and/or group technical evaluations.
     A4.3.5. TRWs and TRGs obtain information on the potential availability of government billeting,
     messing, and transportation--approximate travel time according to ETCA (https://etca.ran-
     dolph.af.mil). Prepare the RFPP and submit it to HQ AETC/A3T and to all AETC offices required for
     coordination. For medical courses, route through HQ AETC/SGNU for their approval. For
     AETC-managed RFPPs, distribute one copy to HQ AETC/A3T and one copy to 2 AF/DO. For medi-
     cal courses, distribute one copy to HQ AETC/SGNU.
     A4.3.6. Guidance concerning additional security requirements generated after the submission of the
     RFPP by the wing and/or group must be included in the wing and/or group technical evaluation or by
     separate correspondence if the technical evaluation has previously been submitted.
NOTE: DoDD 5220.22 and AFI 31-601 require contracts containing DD Form 254 is coordinated
through the appropriate security forces office. This coordination should be obtained at the time the TM is
preparing the RFPP and should be shown in DD Form 254, item 15. Inspections.
     A4.3.7. HQ AETC/A4/7 monitors and confirms with OPR and verifies availability of GFP.
     A4.3.8. TRWs, TRGs, or AFSAT evaluate contractor proposals as follows:
        A4.3.8.1. Review the technical portion of proposals. The evaluation is based on the information
        in Attachment 5. Evaluations on competitive, negotiated proposals are made on a comparative
        basis to determine which proposals should be accepted in the best interest of the Air Force. Full
        justification stating reasons for acceptance or rejection is required.
        A4.3.8.2. Review the contractor's proposals to detect and validate any difference in GFP require-
        ments from those established by the initial AETC Forms 259 and 259A. When changes are
        required for GFP, the wing and/or group plans requirements division or the training resources
        branch prepares the updated AETC Forms 259 and 259A, to include the new requirements. Send a
        copy of the updated AETC Form 259 to the materiel management branch (mission support group)
        to verify availability of the GFP before submitting the evaluation to HQ AETC/A4RM.
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                            33


     A4.3.8.3. Determine the availability of military housing, messing, and transportation facilities for
     student use.
     A4.3.8.4. Prepare the evaluation correspondence according to Attachment 5 and forward elec-
     tronic copies to the appropriate contracting office within 10 workdays after receipt of proposal.
  A4.3.9. Before submitting evaluation to the appropriate contracting office, TRWs and TRGs review
  contractor proposals and technical evaluations to verify that:
     A4.3.9.1. Numbers of students are correct and properly identified.
     A4.3.9.2. Students’ entry prerequisites are correct.
     A4.3.9.3. Starting dates are compatible with training, GFP availability, and other lead-time
     requirements.
  A4.3.10. TRWs and TRGs ensure action has been initiated to determine:
     A4.3.10.1. Availability of government quarters, messing, and transportation.
     A4.3.10.2. Compatibility of security clearance requirement for students with course classification
     and facility access requirements. If not compatible, inform the contracting officer in writing of
     changes required and action initiated for the wing and/or group to revise the DD Form 254.
     A4.3.10.3. Whether an administration unit or training representative is required to perform evalu-
     ation duties as described in Attachment 5.
     A4.3.10.4. Examine suitability of:
         A4.3.10.4.1. Course content, length, and objectives.
         A4.3.10.4.2. Amount and type or preparation effort proposed.
         A4.3.10.4.3. Type and availability of training facilities.
  A4.3.11. HQ AETC/A3T validates training equipment, facilities, and support data products for those
  systems managed at headquarters. For medical courses, HQ AETC/SGNU validates training equip-
  ment, facilities, and support.
  A4.3.12. TRWs and TRGs notify the contracting officer in writing of any required changes in the
  RFPP prior to contract negotiations. When GFP is involved, attach a final (original) AETC Form 259
  and 259A to the evaluation.
  A4.3.13. TRWs and TRGs inform HQ AETC/A4/7 of any contract changes that will affect GFP avail-
  ability.
  A4.3.14. TRWs and TRGs confirm availability of GFP to HQ AETC/A4/7.
  A4.3.15. TRWs and TRGs confirm availability of technical data, and ADPE (computer time when
  required) to the wing and/or group project officer.
  A4.3.16. HQ AETC/A4/7 confirms availability of GFP and supply support to the appropriate contrac-
  tor office.
  A4.3.17. TMs (AFSAT excluded).
     A4.3.17.1. Submit AETC Form 179A to flow course schedules from TPS to OTA or DIMHRS/
     ELM.
34                                                                       AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


        A4.3.17.2. Ensure TTMS or impacted training system has the Type 1 course ready to receive stu-
        dent records from the AF system of record.
        A4.3.17.3. Use ETCA to enter course-reporting instructions. Ensure reporting instructions
        include: specific location, time, and person or organization to which the student should report for
        training; information pertaining to availability of government quarters, messing, and local area
        transportation for students. If hire of special conveyance within the area of the TDY station is
        authorized as more advantageous to the government, provide instructions for securing Govern-
        ment Services Administration (GSA) or low-cost rental vehicles. Address at training location to
        which student TDY orders should be sent to arrive 7 days prior to the start of training.
NOTE: In addition to the above reporting instruction, for courses funded by an agency other than AETC,
provide the address of the funding agency to which TDY orders should be sent to arrive 7 days prior to the
start of training.
        A4.3.17.4. Reporting instructions for no-cost or customer-service courses, including direction for
        using MAJCOMs agencies to instruct their personnel that the senior Air Force student will be
        responsible for providing necessary student data to the responsible TRW. This data will consist of:
            A4.3.17.4.1. (For Air Force students on TDY status) One copy of the individual's orders and
            amendments.
            A4.3.17.4.2. (For all other students) Legible roster with the name (last, first, middle initial),
            Social Security number, grade, command or assignment (Air Mobility Command, Air Combat
            Command, US Navy, etc.), sex, and complete organizational mailing address. Send this infor-
            mation to the responsible wing and/or group within 48 hours after start of training.
     A4.3.18. In all cases, the senior class member will be the class leader.
     A4.3.19. TMs input reporting instructions into ETCA before the releasing of quotas to the AF System
     of Record (MilPDS or DIMHRS/ELM upon implementation).
     A4.3.20. The TRW and TRG Materiel Management Branch (Mission Support Group) directs neces-
     sary requisitions, shipping, and local contracting actions upon assignment of a contract number or
     modification number to ensure timely arrival of all items of GFP at the training site.
     A4.3.21. TRW and TRGs notify the technical order distribution office (TODO) of TO requirements
     in support of the contract. When limited quantities of TOs are needed for short-term training contracts,
     submit AFTO Form 276, Special Requisition for Air Force Technical Order/CPIN (Computer Pro-
     gram Identification Number), according to TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, paragraph 6.3.
        A4.3.21.1. Authority to sign AFTO Form 276, and AFTO Form 187, Technical Orders Publica-
        tion Request, is delegated to the training group. When TOs are needed in large quantities and on a
        continuing basis, determine the best way to access or order the required TOs through the TODO
        according to TO 00-5-1, chapters 4 and 6.
        A4.3.21.2. When early training requirements must be satisfied using preliminary TOs, follows the
        guidance in TO 00-5-1, paragraph 6.2.6. Forecasting requirements for TOs to support training
        when wing and/or groups respond to data calls will assist the procuring activity to ensure an ade-
        quate copy number of copies are printed.
     A4.3.22. The TRW Materiel Management Branch (Mission Support Group):
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                               35


     A4.3.22.1. Immediately sends requests for command assistance to Supply (HQ AETC/A4RM)
     when supply delays are experienced.
     A4.3.22.2. Initiates actions to ensure change or destinations for items of GFP being obtained from
     previously programmed training equipment packages.
  A4.3.23. When it is necessary to modify an existing contract, sends a written request to the appropri-
  ate contracting office, with justification and supporting documents. Routing of AF IMT 9 for any con-
  tract modification initiated by the wing and/or group will be the same as original RFPP. The request
  for contract modification will be on an AF IMT 9 in all instances where additional funds are required,
  or by memorandum in all other instances.
  A4.3.24. The contractor conducts training.
  A4.3.25. TRWs and TRGs provide ongoing security guidance to the procuring contracting officer
  according to DoDD 5220.22 and AFI 31-401 and the security classification guide.
  A4.3.26. TRWs and TRGs or AFSAT evaluates training to ensure graduates meet the established
  standards, quality training is being provided, and all terms of the training contract are being met.
  Training provided under no-additional-cost agreements or by off-the-shelf courses does not need to be
  evaluated.
     A4.3.26.1. When training evaluation results indicate the contract is not being or has not been fully
     satisfied, immediately notify the administrative contracting officer and the procuring contracting
     officer.
     A4.3.26.2. For no-cost and, or, or and/or customer service courses, send two copies of AF Form
     1256, Certificate of Training, to each student's organization upon completion of training.
  A4.3.27. Before completion of training, the TRW Materiel Management Branch (Mission Support
  Group) informs HQ AETC/A4RM of items of GFP that are not obligated to be returned to a loaning
  activity and for which no requirement exists at the TRW. The length of the training contract governs
  this action. For contracts over 30 days in length, this action is taken 30 days before completion date.
  For contracts 30 days or less in length, this action is taken at the earliest possible date after start of
  training.
  A4.3.28. When applicable, HQ AETC/A4RM requests the wing and/or group to direct shipment of
  GFP items to other training sites to support other training programs.
  A4.3.29. TRWs and TRGs furnish disposition instructions to the contractor through the cognizant
  administrative contracting officer (with an information copy to A4RM) upon completion of the con-
  tract or any time that items of GFP are no longer required to support the contract. If the GFP is classi-
  fied, send an information copy to the security office.
  A4.3.30. TRWs and TRGs or AFSAT determine if training has been completed satisfactorily based on
  evaluation results obtained from Attachment 5 (disposition instructions issued for all govern-
  ment-furnished equipment and technical data, and all deliverable items specified in the contract
  received and acceptable). Payment of contractor services is handled through the DoD Wide Area
  Workflow (WAWF) secure Web-based system for electronic invoicing, receipt, and acceptance. Upon
  email notification that an invoice has been submitted in WAWF, the TPM will complete processing by
  accessing the WAWF secure web site (https://wawf.eb.mil/) and certify acceptance of the contractor

   discussed outside of the offices responsible for providing input and preparing technical evaluations.
   A5.1.2. Evaluations will be based upon the maximum allowable effort. When acceptance is recom-
   mended and/or exception is taken to the contractor's proposed effort (such as excessive or nonessential
   and recommendations are made to reduce or remove), the evaluator will fully explain the rationale for
   the acceptance and/or exception as backup for sound negotiation. Evaluations will include, but not be
   limited to, specific comments on each of the items listed below.
      A5.1.2.1. Introductory Paragraph. The first item will be an introductory paragraph. It may
      include comments regarding sole source contractors involved if competitive and, if applicable,
      identify wing and/or group management group participation.
      A5.1.2.2. Preparation for Training. Include:
          A5.1.2.2.1. Number and category of personnel required to prepare for training.

        solving them.
        A5.1.2.10. Recommendation. The evaluator recommends overall approval or disapproval of the
        contractor's proposal.
NOTE: Since the contracting officer is responsible for determining applicability or reasonableness of
cost items, such as overhead, general and administrative, direct labor rates, auto rental, and per diem, the
evaluation letter will not contain comments about these areas.

A5.2. Review of GFP Requirements:
     A5.2.1. The primary purpose of this review is to detect and validate any differences in GFP require-
     ments from the requirements established on the initial AETC Form 259 and 259A.
     A5.2.2. The group training support squadron validates GFP requirements and all government-fur-
     nished technical data requirements as follows:
        A5.2.2.1. Annotate AETC Form 259 to indicate quantities of equipment that can be provided
        from training group assets to include that which has been programmed and is not currently on
        hand but is scheduled to be delivered in time to satisfy the need date. Forward the AETC Form 259
        to Materiel Management Branch (Mission Support Group).
        A5.2.2.2. Prepare the final AETC Form 259A for submission to the training plans branch. Part II,
        column C, contains the latest availability status of required technical data.
        A5.2.2.3. When AETC assistance is required; provide HQ AETC/A3T updates and copies of
        applicable correspondence on GFP; specifically information related to inquiries about the avail-
        ability of GFP, responses to those inquiries, and all information on follow-up actions taken.
     A5.2.3. Materiel Management Branch (Mission Support Group) will complete actions required to
     determine availability of GFP as follows:
        A5.2.3.1. Review the contractor's proposals for spare parts and/or bit-and-piece requirements and
        actions necessary to support such requirements.
        A5.2.3.2. When government property, spares, bit-and-piece, and/or other supply support is avail-
        able at the training site (contractor's facility or other training site), obtain authority for its use in
        support of the training program, and furnish such authority to HQ AETC/A4RM. Use of equip-
        ment or other supply support is on a noninterference joint-use basis or full-time basis as the train-
        ing requirements dictate. All correspondence pertaining to this property must refer to the
        respective RFP number. Do not include ADPE (computer time) on AETC Form 259 as GFP. For
        information purposes only, confirm and annotate availability of ADPE requirements on AETC
        Form 259A.
        A5.2.3.3. Prepare AETC Form 259 after availability of GFP has been confirmed for submission
        to AETC as an attachment to the overall base evaluation of the contractor's proposal. Annotate
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                               39


      column C, part II, indicating the latest status of availability of required GFP. Provide information
      copies of all letters and messages obtaining GFP availability to HQ AETC/A4RM.
      A5.2.3.4. Advise HQ AETC/A4RM immediately when all arrangements for supply support of
      GFP or other material requirements have been completed.

A5.3. Training Evaluation Definitions:
   A5.3.1. Field Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis if training data from sources outside the for-
   mal training environment; for example, graduates, and supervisors in the using commands.
   A5.3.2. Internal Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of data from sources inside the formal
   training environment.
   A5.3.3. Support Evaluation. The determination of the adequacy of the dormitories, dining halls, and
   other support facilities and services impacting on student welfare and training effectiveness.

A5.4. Specific Procedures for Evaluating Type 1 Contract Training:
   A5.4.1. General Guidance:
      A5.4.1.1. Type 1 Training is evaluated to ensure graduates meet the established standards, quality
      training is being provided, and all terms of the training contract are being met.
      A5.4.1.2. Exact procedures used in conducting contract-training evaluations depend on a number
      of factors, such as:
          A5.4.1.2.1. Availability of an AETC training administrative unit or training representative.
          A5.4.1.2.2. Duration of course.
          A5.4.1.2.3. Total cost of the course.
          A5.4.1.2.4. Number of classes to be trained.
          A5.4.1.2.5. Class sizes and total trained personnel requirements.
          A5.4.1.2.6. Course documentation on which the contract is based.
          A5.4.1.2.7. Extent of the anticipated results of contractor preparation effort.
      A5.4.1.3. The method of evaluation is determined during the development of the training portion
      of the systems program and/or the training plan.
      A5.4.1.4. The scope of training evaluation must be based on cost-effectiveness factors including:
          A5.4.1.4.1. Cost of the training program.
          A5.4.1.4.2. Grade and experience level of the students being evaluated.
          A5.4.1.4.3. Degree of specificity of course objectives.
          A5.4.1.4.4. Reliability of results based on number of cases available and dependability of data
          source.
          A5.4.1.4.5. Potential usefulness of findings in correcting deficiencies and improving training.
          A5.4.1.4.6. Availability of resources.
40                                                                       AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008


        A5.4.1.5. Training evaluation projects and reports must be timely. After-the-fact summaries may
        be of some value; however, the objective should be to use findings for the correction or improve-
        ment of current training. Evaluation projects and procedures should provide for early reviews of
        training and training support.
     A5.4.2. Certification of Contractor Performance:
        A5.4.2.1. The responsible wing and/or group or AFSAT is required to evaluate special contract
        training in progress and certify satisfactory contract completion.
        A5.4.2.2. Wing and/or group(s) or AFSAT must report findings of any real or implied violation of
        special contract training contracts. These findings, with wing and/or group recommendations, are
        furnished to the contracting officer (AETC CONS). Information copies of such correspondence
        are furnished to the administrative contracting officer. Initiate Contractor Performance Assess-
        ment Reporting System (CPARS) on contractor performance.
     A5.4.3. Use of Student Evaluation Questionnaires:
        A5.4.3.1. As a minimum requirement, all AETC CONS-issued Type 1 training contracts must
        contain provisions for: (a) administration of student evaluation (AETC Form 258, Student Evalu-
        ation of Training) which is conducted by the contractor in the absence of a full-time training rep-
        resentative, and (b) transmittal of all completed evaluation forms to the wing and/or group. If
        forms contain derogatory remarks that imply unsatisfactory contractor performance, recommen-
        dations for corrective action must be made by the contractor and submitted to the wing and/or
        group or AFSAT.
        A5.4.3.2. Completed student critique forms and summaries are retained with the wing and/or
        group or AFSAT contract file according to the RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds/
        index.cfm.
     A5.4.4. Training Evaluation Visits:
        A5.4.4.1. The requirement for evaluation visits by wing and/or group or AFSAT representatives
        depends upon the availability and the qualifications of AETC (including AFSAT) personnel either
        stationed at or TDY to the training location or instructors (or senior Air Force students) attending
        the courses. Before certifications, each training program should be evaluated at least once by the
        wing and/or group offices of primary responsibility or selected representative using standard or
        modified evaluation procedures depending on the size of the program. For courses of relatively
        long duration or involving several classes, more than one evaluation (including wing and/or group
        representative visits) may be necessary. Personnel who make visits to evaluate contract-training
        programs will complete AETC Form 123 while at the training location.
        A5.4.4.2. The most effective evaluation of contract training and contractor performance occurs
        when a full-time representative of the wing and/or group is located at the training site and periodic
        visits are made. Based on the considerations outlined, the responsible TRW must determine if a
        full-time representative is justified.
        A5.4.4.3. The administrative unit and/or training representative keeps the wing and/or group
        informed of the effectiveness of the program (adequacy of instruction, training materials, training
        equipment, facilities, and training schedules), and any other matters related to the quality of train-
        ing and student achievement. When a Type 1 course is conducted at a base with a detachment, and
        in the absence of an administrative unit/training representative, the detachment commander
AETCI36-2219 18 APRIL 2008                                                                             41


     should be tasked to assist in the evaluation of contract training. Provide results to the responsible
     wing and/or group.
     A5.4.4.4. The administrative unit and/or training representative also keeps the wing and/or group
     informed of any possible program stoppage or slippage, major equipment changes, or condition
     which might present a future problem, particularly any indication of failure to meet contract obli-
     gations. In the latter case, the Technical Support and Training Flight (AETC CONS) is immedi-
     ately informed of circumstances involved, with wing and/or group's recommendations.
  A5.4.5. Use of Instructors in Student Status. Technical training instructors attending Type 1
  courses may be used to assist in evaluating contract training. Students who participate in the evalua-
  tion of contract training are furnished course control documents, evaluation checklists, and pertinent
  information regarding contractual requirements. However, they do not have authority to make any
  contractual change. Furnish evaluation results to the AETC training representative if assigned. If a
  training representative is not assigned, provide results to the responsible wing and/or group.
