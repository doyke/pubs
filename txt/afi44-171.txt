                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose for Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Operations.
   1.1.1. To deliver the highest quality, evidence-based, patient-centered care to enrolled
   patients through team-oriented processes, enhanced access, improved provider continuity,
   superior communications and coordinated prevention, education, and management of
   patients. This approach will provide operational health and readiness for all military
   members and promote optimal clinical currency for the members of the team.
   1.1.2. To create an innovative, rewarding, and productive practice environment that attracts
   and retains highly qualified, top performing medical professionals.
      1.1.2.1. To utilize to maximum effect the skills of all team members.
      1.1.2.2. To emphasize continuous improvement of team workflow processes and patient
      flow. PCMH operations integrate technological tools to enhance communications with
      patients and provide agile tracking of health parameters for individual patients and across
      the population of patients.
1.2. Goals of PCMH.
   1.2.1. Establish the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) as the Medical Home for enrolled
   beneficiaries.
   1.2.2. Provide optimal patient-centered care for enrolled patients using evidence-based
   clinical practice grounded in established population health principles.
   1.2.3. Establish standard processes, clinic alignment, roles for health care team members,
   and continuous improvement to execute the principles of PCMH.
1.3. Core Principles of PCMH.
   1.3.1. There are seven core principles of PCMH: patients will have a personal provider, the
   provider will direct the medical practice, the team will care for patients in a whole person
   orientation, patient care will be coordinated/integrated, quality of care and patient safety are
   paramount, the team will provide enhanced access, and payment will be reformed. In
   addition, medical homes will consistently measure and seek to improve performance within
   the core principles through innovation and continuous quality improvement initiatives.

                                         Chapter 3

                                  PCMH OPERATIONS

3.1. PCMH Clinic Structure.
   3.1.1. PCMH Team Composition.
      3.1.1.1. PCMH teams will be set up as follows: Family Health will have one registered
      nurse, five 4Ns and two providers, one being a board certified or board eligible Family
      Medicine Physician the other being a General Medical Officer (GMO), Physician
      Assistant (PA), Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP), or another Family Medicine Physician.
      Beginning in FY 2016 the PCMH staffing model for Family Health will be revised to the
      extended team model. The key features to this change include but are not limited to: 3 to
      5 provider teams and the addition of 4As to the teams. MTFs are authorized to transition
      to this model prior to FY2016 but must coordinate their transition through the PCMH
      Branch AFMOA/SGHC. (T-3). Pediatric teams will have two nurses, four 4Ns, one 4A
      and two providers, one will be a board eligible Pediatrician, the other may be a Pediatric
      Nurse Practitioner. PCMH teams will adhere to the guidelines, unless a variation is
      authorized by PCMH Branch, AFMOA/SGHC, (T-3). Team builds for IM, Flight
      Medicine, and GME programs will be developed through AFMOA, SG consultants, and
      the corporate process. Once established and programmed MTFs will adhere to the new
      staffing models, (T-3).
      3.1.1.2. All PCMH staff will be assigned to and consistently work with only one PCMH
      team to maintain continuity with their assigned provider team, (T-3).
   3.1.2. PCMH Team Enrollment.
      3.1.2.1. Family Health and Pediatrics PCMH teams will be enrolled to an average of
      1250 patients per provider; see section 4.3 of this instruction for provider enrollment
      guidance, (T-3). Flight Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Graduate Medical Education
      Clinics enrollment will be determined once those clinics are stood up. Once established,
      team enrollment levels will only be changed via coordination with the PCMH Branch,
      AFMOA/SGHC, (T-2).
   3.1.3. PCMH Team Support Functions.
      3.1.3.1. Other personnel in the MTF are considered integral to the optimization of
      PCMH operations and include, but are not be limited to:
         3.1.3.1.1. Internal Behavioral Health Consultant (IBHC) works as a consultant to the
         PCMs on behavioral health issues and provide brief evidenced-based interventions to
         patients across a wide variety of medical and mental health conditions.
         3.1.3.1.2. Behavioral Health Care Facilitator (BHCF) are specially trained registered
         nurse assigned to primary care clinics who track, monitor, and assist with adherence
         to pharmacological treatment. They primarily work with patients presenting with
         depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety, and
         provide updates to the PCM on treatment adherence and progression. The BHCF will
         collaborate closely with the IBHC provider and PCM team to coordinate behavioral
 22                                                           AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


          health care and provide motivational interviewing to assist patients with basic
          problem-solving to promote behavioral change where indicated, (T-3).
          3.1.3.1.3. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC) oversees and manages the installation
          EFMP-M program IAW AFI 40-701, Medical Support to Family Member Relocation
          and Exceptional Family Member Program. The SNC is an integral member of the
          overseas clearance process and identifies sponsors and their family members with
          special needs to determine the ongoing necessary medical and educational services
          required for family members based on specific conditions, to support access to
          specialized services at the current and projected duty assignment, and to protect
          federal rights and entitlements for mobile family members. The SNC, with the SGH,
          will provide initial and annual training to MTF clinical personnel on the use of DoD
          criteria for identifying family members with special medical and educational needs,
          and EFMP-M referral procedures, (T-3).
          3.1.3.1.4. Referral Management Center (RMC) Staff are responsible for following
          referral business rules IAW AFI 44-176, (T-3). Clinical teams should direct patients
          to go to the RMC after receiving a referral and prior to leaving the MTF. The RMC
          staff is responsible for briefing patients on the process of obtaining care via a referral
          and ensuring MTF staff is aware of current referral management processes.
          3.1.3.1.5. Pharmacist-provided services include, but are not limited to, services
          related to medication therapy management, ambulatory care, prescription renewal,
          over the counter medications, and medication reconciliation.
   3.1.4. Space requirements.
      3.1.4.1. PCMH Operations have found that a minimum of two exam rooms per provider
      and office space to accommodate the team create a more successful environment.
      3.1.4.2. Exam rooms should be configured in a standard fashion within each clinic to
      enable clinic flexibility and maximal use of space by available providers (T-3).
3.2. PCMH Neighborhood.
   3.2.1. The PCMH team is the central hub of patient information, primary care provision, and
   care coordination. All care that happens outside of the PCMH is considered part of the
   PCMH Neighborhood.
   3.2.2. The goal of the PCMH Neighborhood is to promote integrated, coordinated care
   throughout the entire health care system, including specialists, subspecialists, and other
   health care entities who are involved in care of the patient.
   3.2.3. PCMH teams and neighborhoods will need to effectively communicate, provide safe
   and timely coordination of care/hand-offs, and integrate care practices (such as co-
   management determinations, effective flow of information, etc.) in a bi-directional manner to
   provide the highest quality care to the patient, (T-3).
3.3. PCMH Special Programs.
   3.3.1. Preventive Health Assessment (PHA).
      3.3.1.1. PHA will be managed by Aerospace Medicine IAW AFI 44-170, Preventive
      Health Assessment.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 23


     3.3.1.2. The active component member’s primary assigned provider will continue to be
     responsible for any face-to-face visit required for PHA, but may direct another qualified
     provider to complete the exam as mission requirements dictate IAW AFI 44-170, (T-3).
     3.3.1.3. Staffing for the PHA cell will be assigned outside of the Family Health Clinic
     IAW AFI 44-170.
  3.3.2. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).
     3.3.2.1. Where existing, PRP clinics/programs will be aligned under Flight/Operational
     Medicine, (T-3).
     3.3.2.2. If the MTF does not have a separate PRP clinic, PRP patients may be enrolled to
     Flight Medicine or FHC as directed by MTF leadership.
     3.3.2.3. If PRP patients are enrolled in the FHC, distribution will be determined by
     MDG/CC. The MDG/CC and SGP should determine the best approach to meet access
     needs while maintaining requirements of the PRP program, (T-3).
  3.3.3. Enhanced Access.
     3.3.3.1. Enhanced Access describes a suite of strategies essential to PCMH. Access in
     this context should no longer be considered only an appointment with a provider, but
     rather the entire spectrum of options a MTF PCMH can deliver to provide care to the
     patient.
     3.3.3.2. Enhanced Access options include, but are not limited to, secure messaging,
     nurse/tech run clinics, Support Staff Protocols, Group Appointments, Nurse
     Advice/Telephone Consults, Pharm-D Clinics, and Physical Therapy Clinic within the
     PCMH Clinic.
     3.3.3.3. PCMH clinics will utilize Enhanced Access options and utilize the Enhanced
     Access Toolkit provided by AFMOA SGHC, (T-2).
 24                                                          AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 4

                             GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURES

4.1. Continuity of Care.
   4.1.1. Continuity is the foundation of PCMH and is defined as maintaining an ongoing
   personal relationship between the patient and their provider. To build this relationship
   requires continuity.
      4.1.1.1. MTFs will develop appointing protocols that will maximize continuity whereby
      enrollees are appointed to their assigned primary care manager or team to the maximum
      extent possible, (T-3).
      4.1.1.2. Under standard operations the strategies to maintain continuity within Family
      Health and Pediatric clinics should be executed with the goal of achieving the following:
          4.1.1.2.1. Patient - PCM (provider) continuity should be maintained at or greater than
          70%, (T-2).
          4.1.1.2.2. Patient - PCMH Team continuity should be maintained at or greater than
          90%, (T-2).
      4.1.1.3. Provider continuity, Team continuity, and cross booking standards for Internal
      Medicine, Flight/Operational Medicine, and GME clinics have not yet been standardized.
      All PCMH clinics will meet all access standards IAW AFI 44-176, (T-2).
      4.1.1.4. For all PCMH clinics the process of cross booking patients to other PCMH
      teams should be minimized; appointing protocols should be constructed with this goal in
      mind, (T-2).
             4.1.1.4.1.1. However, judicious use of cross booking within Family Health and
             Pediatric clinics may be used when necessary for acute access within 10% of
             available appointments to maintain patient-MTF continuity, (T-3).
          4.1.1.4.2. Under specific conditions of extended provider absences (deployment,
          hiring gaps, etc.), patients may be administratively re-empanelled equitably among
          the remaining PCMH providers for continuity purposes, with the expected impact on
          apparent cross booking and continuity rates.
      4.1.1.5. Every effort should be made to see AD patients within the empanelled clinic;
      AD should only be deferred to urgent care/ER locations during the duty day under
      appropriate clinical situations (i.e. true or suspected medical emergency) or during times
      of extreme provider shortage,(T-3).
      4.1.1.6. Residency clinics may require more cross-booking than non-residency clinics
      due to educational requirements that decrease provider availability in clinic. Residency
      leadership, in conjunction with GPMs, will manage schedules to minimize this to greatest
      extent possible.
      4.1.1.7. MTFs will utilize other strategies in order to maintain continuity, to include:
          4.1.1.7.1. The Access Checklist to assist in developing action plans to minimize
          effects of short and long term provider and clinic support staff shortages.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     25


          4.1.1.7.2. Ensuring processes are in place to provide backfill to any member of the
          PCMH team practicing in the clinic setting to provide for maximal patient continuity.
          4.1.1.7.3. Implementation of enhanced access (utilizing tools described in paragraph
          3.3.3. of this instruction) to the fullest extent possible within all PCMH clinics not
          only to improve continuity but to optimize care and improve access.
4.2. Appointment Availability.
   4.2.1. A minimum of 90 centrally available appointments per week per Family Health and
   Pediatric provider will be open and available to be centrally scheduled IAW AFI 44-176, (T-
   2).
   4.2.2. For weeks with fewer than five duty days (i.e., holiday, family day), the available
   appointment requirement will be prorated accordingly, typically at 18 appointments per day
   (i.e., 72 appointments if four days, 54 appointments if three days, etc.), (T-2).
   4.2.3. Centrally available appointments are those that may be booked at all levels to include
   appointing clerks, TRICARE On-Line (TOL), Nurse Advice Line and clinic personnel.
      4.2.3.1. Detail codes may be used when needed; however, excess use of detail codes may
      result in restriction of access and is discouraged.
      4.2.3.2. Freezing, blocking or other similar restrictions on the 90 centrally available
      appointments per week is prohibited, (T-3).
   4.2.4. During periods of leave/TDY, significant support staff shortages, or extended training
   (e.g. Operational Readiness Exercise [ORE], etc.) involving an entire day, schedules will
   reflect the prorated amount of centrally available appointments based on provider available
   time. These periods of absence are to be properly annotated within DMHRSi, (T-3).
   4.2.5. Clinical absences of one duty day or longer (i.e., leave, TDY) are not to be made-up
   and the required number of available appointments are to be prorated accordingly.
   4.2.6. For less than a full day absence, appointments are to be “made up”. These
   appointments should be as proximal to the time of absence as possible to maintain necessary
   access.
   4.2.7. The SGH, in coordination with the Squadron/CCs and Flight Commander, may waive
   the requirement to make up appointments lost to absences less than a full day if those
   absences are related to required medical group functions (required meetings, readiness-
   related functions, etc.) and the reduction in available appointments does not significantly
   impact patient access. A complete analysis of patient access and demand should be
   completed prior to this determination.
   4.2.8. The SGH, in conjunction with Squadron/CC, Flight Commander, Credentials
   Function, and when appropriate the SGP, may also waive number of available appointments
   based on issues that may affect provider ability to deliver safe/quality care, (T-3). These
   situations include, but are not limited to the following: experience level of providers
   (recently out of training), significant call responsibilities that affect reasonable provider
   “crew rest”, provider inpatient responsibilities, provider illness or other medical conditions.
   The SGH will document any waived requirements in Executive Staff Committee or ECOMS
   minutes, (T-3).
 26                                                            AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


   4.2.9. Providers are to have the authority, with reasonable lead-time, to adjust their
   schedule/templates as long as access and available appointment standards are maintained,
   (T-3). Routine schedule adjustments are not to result in patient cancellations/rescheduling,
   (T-3).
   4.2.10. The appointment availability standards will not apply to Internal Medicine, Flight
   Medicine or GME programs. These programs will continue to adhere to standards
   established between the MTF and AFMOA/SGHC PCMH Branch and must comply with
   AFI 44-176. In addition, each program needs to assess its true demand requirement for the
   empanelled population and meet that requirement.
   4.2.11. Physicians who provide additional services mandated by AFMS guidance (i.e.
   Allergy Extender) for the entire MTF population or perform mission essential functions (e.g.
   overseas clearance, deployment line processing, etc.) for the entire MTF population will have
   the requirement for centrally available appointments prorated accordingly, (T-3).
   4.2.12. Providers who have conditions that require shortened duty days will have available
   appointment requirement prorated to account for hours available in clinic, (T-3).
   4.2.13. At MTFs that offer inpatient care, active component physicians assigned to PCMH
   clinics will be required to perform inpatient duties within the scope of their credentials, (T-
   3). Inpatient rounding may take place during provider managed time. At locations where a
   PCMH clinic physician manages the entire inpatient medical service or there is significant
   shared inpatient workload, the requirement for centrally available appointments will be
   prorated accordingly, (T-3). Care should be taken to accurately measure the actual time
   spent involved in inpatient care in the process of this proration.
4.3. PCMH Enrollment.
   4.3.1. Enrollment targets will be based on the number of PCMs authorized at each MTF
   according to the applicable enrollment targets as set forth in the annual Performance Plan
   (PP), (T-2). Balancing of residency panels and actual enrollment numbers will be based on
   training guidelines established by the ACGME.
   4.3.2. Flexibility within actual enrollment to individual providers/teams is allowed as long as
   the facility maintains the overall patient/provider ratio required for the respective clinic type.
   Facilities may also consider balancing panels across teams based on additional duties (i.e.
   element leader 1,000; other clinic providers 1,300) using the same total enrollment
   requirements for the respective clinic.
   4.3.3. Facilities may consider balancing panels within a clinic/team based on patient acuity/
   complexity and demand (i.e. family physician 1,150; mid-level provider 1,350), as long as
   the facility/clinic total enrollment achieves the required ratios.
      4.3.3.1. Patients will be empanelled to providers based on the patient’s specific needs
      and the skill set of the provider, (T-3).
      4.3.3.2. PCM patient panels will be equalized across the MTF to ensure an acceptable
      distribution of patient acuity levels between PCMs, (T-3).
   4.3.4. Aggressive template management is used to enable provider-managed time providing
   standards for appointment availability are met by the provider. This can will be utilized for
   procedure visits, high-acuity care, MEBs, OPRs, etc.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    27


   4.3.5. Providers may be required at times to see “must see” patients such as contractors and
   Department of Defense Dependent School (DODDS) patients. These patients are not
   enrolled patients.
   4.3.6. PCM enrollments will be equalized across the clinic to distribute patient acuity levels
   that are appropriate to clinical training and experience between PCMs IAW paragraph 2.12.1.
   of this instruction, (T-3).
4.4. Staff Continuity.
   4.4.1. Every effort will be made to have two assigned technicians available and working
   with each provider on a daily basis (T-3). The minimum expectation is that continuity will be
   maintained between a provider and at least one of his/her assigned technicians for each clinic
   session, (T-3).
   4.4.2. All PCMH staff will be assigned to the PCMH clinic for a minimum of two years, (T-
   2). During that time they should be assigned to the same PCMH team unless mission
   performance would be adversely affected by keeping them in place, (T-2).
   4.4.3. During significant support staff shortages, the SGH may authorize clinics to have
   decreased appointments.
4.5. Huddles.
   4.5.1. Maximizing communication within the PCMH team is crucial.
   4.5.2. PCMH teams will conduct huddles IAW paragraphs 2.11.1-2.11.2 of this instruction.
4.6. Team Training/Continuous Improvement Activities.
   4.6.1. Additional time may be allotted for process improvement, team training, discussion of
   team roles, etc. and may be done at the team level or flight level (i.e. clinic training at
   monthly staff meeting).
4.7. Medical Home Patients.
   4.7.1. The MTF Executive Committee, based upon recommendations of the Population
   Health Function (PHF), must identify subsets of enrollees who make the MTF their “medical
   home” vs. those who are empanelled but obtain their health care elsewhere, (T-3).
   4.7.2. Local policies for specific approaches to preventive management of these subsets will
   need to be developed, (T-3).
4.8. Staff Availability.
   4.8.1. All clinics will establish a minimum staffing threshold to meet patient care needs, (T-
   2).
   4.8.2. All PCMH Clinic staff leaves, TDYs, and other planned time off should be
   projected/approved at a minimum of 6 months out, except in extenuating circumstances, and
   will be coordinated to minimize impact on access, (T-3). MTF leadership will establish local
   policy on this issue, (T-3).
       4.8.2.1. Schedule changes after appointments have been loaded into CHCS should be
       minimized and require SGH approval, (T-3).
28                                                       AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


     4.8.2.2. The GPM assists PCMH team leadership and Flight Commander/Flight Chief in
     projecting team member absences to provide adequate access.                The Flight
     Commander/Flight Chief maintains approval authority for all absences within the flight.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      29

                                  BUSINESS OPERATIONS

5.1. MEPRS.
   5.1.1. Each PCMH team will be assigned a unique 4-letter MEPRS (BGAx, BDAx etc.) and
   appropriate clinic builds, (T-3).
   5.1.2. Accuracy of MEPRS data is crucial. Staff will record accurate data for hours worked
   in their primary MEPRS, (T-3).
   5.1.3. All staff are required to use the proper MEPRS code for activities performed outside
   their primary clinical MEPRS (e.g. readiness training, fitness time, etc.) and accurately report
   actual hours for these additional activities, (T-3).
   5.1.4. To evaluate the efficiency of time allotted to patient care, all PCMH team personnel
   will report PCMH team-related hours in three DMHRSi subtasks: face-to-face patient care,
   non face-to-face patient care, and non-clinical administrative duties performed within the
   clinic, (T-3). Examples are as follows:
Task Number: BGAA_DMIS_FF
Task Name: Face-to-Face
Description: Face-to-Face Clinical Care

Task Number: BGAA_DMIS_NF
Task Name: Non Face-to-Face
Description: Non Face-to-Face Clinical Care (Reviewing Labs, Charting, etc.)

Task Number: BGAA_DMIS_NC
Task Name: Non Clinical
Description: Non Clinical Administrative Duties within the Clinic (Flt Meetings, Clinic Mgmt.,
etc.)
   5.1.5. Actual hours will be reported for each subtask.
5.2. Deployment Operations.
   5.2.1. Proper AEF block alignment is the responsibility of the MTF and will be worked in
   close coordination with AF/SG Family Medicine, Pediatric, Internal Medicine, or Flight
   Medicine Consultants as needed.
   5.2.2. The providers on a PCMH team will not be aligned in the same AEF block, (T-3).
   5.2.3. Technicians assigned to a specific provider may be assigned to the same AEF block as
   their provider as manning permits. NOTE: The senior 4N Functional Manager will provide
   skill level balancing for both in-garrison and garrison operations when assigning technicians
   to the same AEF block.
   5.2.4. Active component clinic nurses assigned to a PCMH team may be assigned to the
   same AEF block as one of the team providers.
30                                                          AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


  5.2.5. Consultant Balanced Deployments (CBD) are integral to the current deployment
  management. To maintain visibility for the AFSC specific consultants, it is the responsibility
  of the individual and/or MTFs to work though their MAJCOM to inform the AF/SG
  Consultant of any unique circumstances (i.e. board exams, surgery, pregnancy) which would
  preclude deploying during a specific block in the AEF cycle.
     5.2.5.1. The AF/SG Consultants will actively make recommendations regarding the
     personnel within their control to optimize the placement of the right personnel at the right
     time in the right location in support of deployed operations, as well as MTF garrison
     operations, (T-3).
     5.2.5.2. Active management and communication with the MAJCOM and consultant is
     essential to minimize the impact of deployment on MTF patient care.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   31

                     OPERATIONAL MEASUREMENTS/METRICS

6.1. Continuity of Care.
   6.1.1. Continuity of Care will be measured as:
       6.1.1.1. PCM Continuity: the percentage of patients seen by the provider to whom they
       are enrolled.
       6.1.1.2. Team Continuity:     the percentage of patients seen within the PCMH team
       provider pool.
6.2. HEDIS Measures.
   6.2.1. The most important currently available measure for patient preventive care is HEDIS
   derived data.
   6.2.2. PCMH Clinics will track patient HEDIS metrics that are appropriate to the patients
   enrolled in that clinic, (T-3).
   6.2.3. Currently tracked individual HEDIS measures are combined into a composite score
   based on national percentile ranks for each of the individual measures and presented as
   individual and composite scores.
   6.2.4. These HEDIS measures should be reviewed by the SGH with the providers on a
   monthly basis, (T-3).
6.3. Patient Satisfaction.
   6.3.1. Patient satisfaction will continue to be measured via the Service Delivery Assessment
   (SDA) until further notice.
   6.3.2. The results of the SDA will be reviewed with PCMH teams on a monthly basis, (T-3).
6.4. ED/UCC Utilization.
   6.4.1. While the goal of PCMH is to deliver care for all of our empanelled patients’ needs,
   there will be times when use of network emergency rooms or urgent care clinic may be
   appropriate.
   6.4.2. Use of emergency room or urgent care clinic by empanelled population will be
   measured at the MTF level.
   6.4.3. These data sets are available on the CarePoint Application Portal and will be reviewed
   with clinic staff on a monthly basis with POC to be determined by the MDG/CC. Suggested
   POC is SGH, GPM, or Flight Commander.
6.5. PCMH Metric Goals.
   6.5.1. All PCMH clinics, to include Family Health, Pediatrics, Flight Medicine, Internal
   Medicine, and Graduate Medical Education (GME) Clinics will strive to achieve or exceed
   the following PCMH goals:
       6.5.1.1. ED/UCC Utilization rate of less than 3.0 per 100 enrolled beneficiaries.
 32                                                         AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014


       6.5.1.2. Patient Satisfaction of 95% or greater as measured by the satisfied and very
       satisfied combined score for responses to the compiled standardized AFMS SDA
       questions.
       6.5.1.3. HEDIS score of 90th percentile or greater for each of the HEDIS measures
       identified by the MHS Clinical Quality Forum and Clinical Measures Steering Panel.
       6.5.1.4. Continuity is the foundation of PCMH and defined as a personal relationship
       between the patient and their provider. To build this relationship requires Continuity.
           6.5.1.4.1. MTFs will develop appointing protocols that will maximize continuity
           whereby enrollees are appointed to their assigned primary care manager or team to
           the maximum extent possible, (T-3).
           6.5.1.4.2. Efforts to meet continuity goals will be conducted in concert with and not
           at the expense of meeting access standards IAW AFI 44-176.
           6.5.1.4.3. Under standard operations the strategies to maintain continuity within
           Family Health and Pediatric clinics should be executed with the goal of achieving the
           following:
               6.5.1.4.3.1. Patient - PCM (provider) continuity should be maintained at or
               greater than 70%, (T-3).
               6.5.1.4.3.2. Patient - PCMH Team continuity should be maintained at or greater
               than 90%, (T-3).
               6.5.1.4.3.3. Continuity standards for Internal Medicine, Flight/Operational
               Medicine, and GME clinics have not yet been standardized.
               6.5.1.4.3.4. For all PCMH clinics, the AFMS cross booking goal is 0%.
                  6.5.1.4.3.4.1. Judicious use of cross booking may be used when necessary for
                  acute access in order to maintain patient-MTF continuity.
                    6.5.1.4.3.4.1.1. Within Family Health and Pediatric clinics, if necessary, up
                    to 10% of available appointments may be cross booked to maintain patient-
                    MTF continuity.
   6.5.2. SGHs will ensure that the identified PCMH metrics are tracked and presented to MTF
   leadership on a monthly basis, (T-3).
   6.5.3. MTFs not meeting the targeted goals for the above PCMH metrics will develop and
   implement strategies to reach these goals, (T-3).
6.6. Staff Satisfaction.
   6.6.1. AFMOA PCMH Branch will conduct twice yearly AFMS clinic staff (AD and GS
   employees) satisfaction surveys. PCMH staff are expected to participate in this survey to the
   maximum extent possible.
   6.6.2. Results of this survey are briefed to the AF/SG during the Strategic Objectives updates
   and disseminated to all MTFs in the Performance Management Forums.
AFI44-171 28 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 33


6.7. Secure Messaging Utilization.
   6.7.1. Patient Initiated Messages as well as Provider and Team Initiated Messages are to be
   tracked on a monthly basis by AFMOA SGHC staff and briefed at the Performance
   Management Forums.
6.8. Performance Management Forums.
   6.8.1. Air Force PCMH Operations are evaluated on a routine basis on their performance in
   the following: Readiness measures, Continuity, ED/UCC utilization, HEDIS, Patient
   Satisfaction, Secure messaging Utilization, Patient Safety and Quality measures, Business
   Plan execution, and Open encounters.
   6.8.2. MTFs will attend Performance Management Forums every 4 months in the group they
   are assigned, (T-3). MDG/CCs and/or other MTF staff as requested by the MDG/CC are
   given the opportunity to discuss their MTFs successes and challenges.
6.9. Inspections.
   6.9.1. The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) Unit Effectiveness Inspections (UEIs)
   includes a continual evaluation of PCMH operations (via the Program Managers, Self-
   Assessment Program Manager, Commanders, Wing Inspection Teams, MAJCOM/Inspector
   General (IG) and Surgeon General (SG)), and AFMOA. The Air Force Inspection Agency
   (AFIA) SG supports MAJCOM/IGs in conducting the medical component of the UEI
   Capstone Event IAW AFI 90-201, Air Force Inspection System.
   6.9.2. MTFs are inspected according to The Joint Commission/AAAHC PCMH
   accreditation standards as determined by the central AFMS accreditation contract.
   6.9.3. All AFMS MTFs will seek an evaluation of their PCMHs as directed by the AF/SG.
