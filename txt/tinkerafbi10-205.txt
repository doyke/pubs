SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision is required to add text message capability via AtHoc to the available notification
options. The instruction number is changed to TAFBI10-205 to comply with AFMC instructions
that an installation level document will be assigned the same number as the AFMC plan or
directive it supports.
1. Background and Policy. The 72d Air Base Wing Commander (72 ABW/CC), 72 ABW
Vice Commander (72 ABW/CV) or 72d Mission Support Group Commander (72 MSG/CC) in
72 ABW/CC’s absence) is the sole authority for implementing the provisions of this instruction.
Events causing a decision to implement notifications under this guidance do not allow time for
pre-coordination, discussion or planning at the time of execution. Each organization must
develop internal procedures to ensure compliance and widest dissemination to personnel on base
at the time of the event. Procedures contained within this instruction were developed by
functional area experts knowledgeable of the capabilities of the systems described herein. Use of
the systems described in this instruction should not prevent development of additional
notification methods within each unit; however, information passed via any other means should
be accurate and factual. In arriving at the decision to utilize the systems herein; the following
factors should be considered:
     1.1. Type of event. This might be a tornado warning, wild fire, active shooter, immediate
     Force Protection Condition (FPCON) change due to terrorist activity or other event that has
     the potential to endanger TAFB personnel if protective measures are not taken immediately.
     1.2. Actions Required. Personnel must take immediate protective measures to enhance
     personal safety to the maximum extent possible.
        1.2.1. Protective measures implemented and the termination of the protective measures
        must be as described in TAFB Plan 10-2 Installation Emergency Management
        Plan,(IEMP), TAFB Plan 10-245, Antiterrorism; TAFB Plan 31-101, Integrated Defense
        Plan, or other emergency action guidance specific to an operation or function. These
        plans                         are                    available                     at:
        https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/Tinker/72DVOC/Plans/Forms/AllItems.aspx           or
        through the organizational emergency or security manager.
2. Activation Of Disaster Response Force. The activation and recall procedures for any
required disaster response force or team will be as identified in the applicable instruction or plan
requiring the formation of that team.
3. Available Options. Five primary methods are available that provide timely, accurate
information to the installation personnel. These methods have been tested and verified and are
tested as prescribed in paragraph 4.2.11. They are:
     3.1. AtHoc system computer screen pop-up messages
     3.2. AtHoc system text messages.
     3.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS) Giant Voice (GV) activation.
     This system may be activated via the AtHoc interface or via a stand-alone system with
     consoles housed in the Installation Command Post (552 ACW/CP or CP) or base weather
     forecast station (72 OSS/OSW).
TINKERAFBI10-205 25 JUNE 2013                                                                  3


   3.4. 72 ABW Command Land Mobile Radio (LMR) net. Commanders will ensure the
   appropriate message is passed throughout their organizations.
   3.5. Pyramid Notifications. The CP and/or Weather Forecast Station will issue alerts via
   AtHoc computer pop-ups, GV or siren activation and the command LMR net. The CP will
   also initiate a prebuilt conference call with the duty stations specified in Attachment 3 and
   provide voiced notification of the event as required by Tinker plans. Each of these stations
   should develop internal procedures to ensure widest dissemination of this information to
   employees on station at the time of notification.
   3.6. Situations requiring the immediate personnel notification are as identified in the
   applicable plan prescribing the action.
   3.7. Many other systems are available to disseminate information throughout TAFB. The
   systems identified in paragraphs 3.1 thru 3.5 above are the primary systems for immediate
   notification. Other available methods may be utilized, time permitting, to further distribute
   necessary information throughout the installation.
4. Responsibilities. Organizational responsibilities for the dissemination of information and for
the maintenance of systems are as identified below. Paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7 identify
responsibilities for all Tinker organizations and personnel.
   4.1. Commander, 72d Air Base Wing will:
       4.1.1. Direct and/or approve the release of all installation-level emergency notification
       messages except those that are time-critical such as a tornado warning.
       4.1.2. Time permitting, advise installation leadership of the potential for events leading
       up to the dissemination of these messages and the necessity of ensuring their
       organizations are prepared to respond appropriately.
   4.2. CP (552 ACW/CP) will:
       4.2.1. Appoint a NCOIC of systems and alternate. The NCOIC of systems will be the
       Command Post office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the application/use of the
       AtHoc system.
       4.2.2. Maintain AtHoc and Giant Voice scenarios and report system outages to 72
       ABW/SC.
       4.2.3. Use the AtHoc system to initiate the various notifications, or to create pre-canned
       scenarios as needed to support a particular situation. Sensitive or Privacy Act protected
       personnel contact data will be accessed only on a need to know basis through
       administrative accounts.
       4.2.4. Not maintain distribution lists. 72 ABW/XP provides Senior and Full Crisis
       Action Team (CAT) rosters and 72 ABW/CEX provides Emergency Operations Center
       (EOC) rosters. The 552 ACW/XP maintains the Senior and Full 552 ACW Battle Staff
       rosters. For other distribution lists/rosters the end user managers/distribution lists
       managers are responsible for maintaining distribution lists according to areas of concern.
       This is accomplished through the AtHoc self service module. Initial sign up into AtHoc
       occurs when a member establishes a NIPR user account with 72 ABW/CS. (See Para
       4.4.5)
4                                                          TINKERAFBI10-205 25 JUNE 2013


       4.2.5. Conduct periodic local area network (LAN) silent tests to determine continuity of
       the “purple globe” signifying AtHoc presence on computers connected to the Tinker
       network. This is a pre-canned alert that end users do not see. This scenario will be sent
       only to desktop computer systems.
       4.2.6. Oversee CP controller training, to include AtHoc initial/recurring/refresher
       training requirements.
       4.2.7. Terminate alerts for situations that are no longer active to prevent end users from
       receiving outdated alerts.
       4.2.8. Maintain notification lists, access lists, and establish system checks/tests to ensure
       these channels are working.
       4.2.9. Ensure console operators are trained on AtHoc, Giant Voice, command LMR net
       and 24-hour work center telephone notification procedures, to include the termination of
       any messages disseminated via the AtHoc system.
       4.2.10. Be the primary function to activate and disseminate messages using the AtHoc,
       Giant Voice, command network and telephone notifications (except tornado warnings).
       4.2.11. Conduct tests of these systems as prescribed in AFI 10-2501 and AFI 10-207.
       Inform the 72 ABW/SC Help Desk of any inoperative systems immediately. The daily
       activation of Reveille, Retreat and Taps are considered to be daily tests of the GV system.
       4.2.12. Maintain a capability to conference call duty stations specified in Attachment 3.
       This will normally be done via a programmed button on the Siemens communications
       console that will call all work centers simultaneously.
    4.3. 72d Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (72 OSS/OSW) will:
       4.3.1. Ensure all weather technicians are trained on the use of AtHoc, Giant Voice, and
       Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS).
       4.3.2. Ensure appropriate personnel are trained on the procedures contained within this
       instruction.
       4.3.3. Be the primary function to activate the AtHoc for tornado watches and activate the
       AtHoc, Giant Voice and INWS for tornado warnings.
       4.3.4. The Weather Flight and CP will conduct tests every Saturday at 1200L in
       conjunction with the National Weather Service of the tornado sirens via the Giant Voice
       and INWS as well as a test of the tornado warning via AtHoc.
    4.4. 72 ABW Communications Directorate (72 ABW/SC) will:
       4.4.1. Manage AtHoc components (to include patches, updates, etc.) including, but not
       limited to, back-up procedures, Giant Voice integrations and AtHoc software installation
       to user computers.
       4.4.2. Manage and maintain the AtHoc user database. Delete users with no Sign-On
       activity in the past 120 days. .
       4.4.2.1. Maintain the INWS and Giant Voice. Maintain the Omnitec system located in
       Building 1100 and ensure voice messages, siren tones and digital voice (DV) messages
TINKERAFBI10-205 25 JUNE 2013                                                                   5


     can be relayed through this system. Maintain the computer interface to these systems to
     initiate daily Reveille, Retreat and Taps. See Attachment 2 for further details on this
     system.
     4.4.3. Ensure the 72 ABW/CC’s LMR net is operational and meets or exceeds the needs
     of net users. Ensure that only personnel authorized by 72 ABW/CC or the CP have
     access to the Commander’s net and that all users’ LMRs are encrypted as needed or
     directed.
     4.4.4. Maintain AtHoc and GV systems described in this instruction.
     4.4.5. Monitor external distribution lists. 72 ABW/SC will create external distribution
     lists and ensure these lists are validated with designated distribution list OPR’s, at a
     minimum, semi-annually. 72 ABW/XP provides Senior and Full Crisis Action Team
     (CAT) membership and 72 ABW/CEX provides Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
     membership. The 552 ACW/XP maintains the Senior and Full 552 ACW Battle Staff
     rosters. Any additional distribution lists created will require appropriate justification and
     an organizational OPRs. (See Para 4.2.4)

                    NOTIFICATION/WARNING SYSTEM DETAILS

A2.1. AtHoc
   A2.1.1. System details:
      A2.1.1.1. AFMC has selected AtHoc INWS Alerts Enterprise Edition as its unified
      alerting solution for network centric alerts, telephone notifications, Giant Voice (GV)
      activation and local COOP disaster recovery using INWS Alerts Mass Alerting System.
      The system is composed of six critical components: (1) a Network Alerting System
      (NAS) for desktop and email/text messaging notifications to all Tinker personnel both at
      work and/or at other locations; (2) a telephone alerting capability via commercial call
      center; (3) a capability to centrally manage, track and report alerts over other devices
      such as phones, pagers, GV and others; (4) integration with the GV systems; (5) a
      redundant local mass alerting system (INWS Alerts MAS) and (6) a failover capability at
      the server locations. Note: 552 ACW and 507 ARW desktops at TAFB have two desktop
      software clients, one pointing to their MAJCOM servers (for MAJCOM unique alerts)
      and the second pointing to local servers (for TAFB alerts). The TAFB local server will
      be the vehicle for disseminating these emergency messages.
   A2.1.2. How AtHoc works:
      A2.1.2.1. Network alerting (computer pop-ups) will address personnel desktops using
      the AtHoc desktop component: a small Executable program residing on personal
      computers. This component enables receipt of desktop alerts from the server. The
      application starts with Windows session logon. It resides in the system tray area, as a
      purple globe icon .
      A2.1.2.2. During normal duty hours, the primary notification method will be by LAN
      (pop-up or email). The telephone option will not be utilized except for duty stations as a
      potential backup for key staff. Alerts will not be sent to an individual’s home, cell phone,
      email or pager during normal duty hours.
      A2.1.2.3. All exercise alerts should be preceded by “EXERCISE – EXERCISE –
      EXERCISE” in the Alert header, to help ensure all personnel can differentiate between
      actual and exercise alerts.
      A2.1.2.4. Once the controller of the system drafts and releases an alert message, the
      system will retrieve the alert data and display the alert pop-up message, often
      accompanied by an audio message, as a persistent desktop pop-up:
 10                                                       TINKERAFBI10-205 25 JUNE 2013



Figure A2.1. Early Dismissal




      A2.1.2.5. Common uses of AtHoc emergency situations include physical/personnel
      security and/or weather events. The system can support other uses; however use will be
      limited to prevent overload of the support system and over exposure for employees.
      A2.1.2.6. Emergency situations include physical security (FPCON, Information
      Condition (INFOCON) changes, Helping Hand, etc.), significant weather events
      (tornado) and any other event which affects personnel or where immediate notification is
      needed. This can include installation-wide notices to avoid specific areas or an active
      shooter situation.
A2.2. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS)
   A2.2.1. The INWS consists of 16 remote siren sites spaced throughout TAFB that are
   designed to provide over-lapping, audible notification. Each has Digital Voice (DV) Chips
   with pre-recorded messages installed and each has standard tone ability installed (Steady
   Tone, Wail, fog horn, etc.). The INWS has the capability to sound manual audio signals
   (microphone, CD player, AtHoc).
   A2.2.2. There are three (3) control locations to initiate messages/warning sirens:
      A2.2.2.1. 552 ACW/CP capabilities: Voice Messages (microphone), Siren Tones and
      DV Messages.       A computer interface also exists in the CP to initiate daily
      Reveille/Retreat/Taps. An AtHoc interface is also available for 552 ACW/CP controller
      use.
      A2.2.2.2. 72 OSS/OSW capabilities: Voice Messages (microphone), Siren Tones, DV
      Messages and the AtHoc interface.
      A2.2.2.3. 72 ABW/SCOIP Building 1100 Omnitec capabilities: Voice Messages
      (microphone), Siren Tones, DV Messages and the computer interface to initiate daily
      Reveille/Retreat/Taps.
TINKERAFBI10-205 25 JUNE 2013                                                                  11


A2.3. 72 ABW Commander Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Network: Is a radio network linking
key 72 ABW organizational leaders.           This network may be monitored by other
commanders/leaders on the installation with the appropriate permissions. Responses and
acknowledgements by these leaders to announcements are not required; however, they must
make every effort to pass any pertinent emergency notifications described in this OI over their
own organizational radio networks.
A2.4. Pyramid Recall: The systems developed and mandated within each unit to ensure verbal
notifications are passed to organizational personnel in accordance with TAFB Plan 17. For the
purposes of this instruction, this recall will be initiated by the 552 ACW /CP and relayed to duty
stations. These work centers must establish procedures to ensure personnel both inside and
outside facilities are notified of the need to implement the appropriate protective measures.
