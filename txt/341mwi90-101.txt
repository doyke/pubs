SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document contains minor administrative changes. This eliminates all references to the
FATS database. Attachment 1 provides a current Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Summary
Report template.
1. Overview: A self-inspection program (SIP) provides an effective means of assessing mission
performance and organizational effectiveness through internal review. The intent is to provide
commanders with a tool for internal assessment of unit health and to complement external
inspections and assessments. Commanders are SIP customers and therefore dictate the quality of
 2                                                             341MWI90-101 9 JANUARY 2012


their SIP. They use SIP results to assess mission readiness and direct resources and energies to
correct deficiencies. A viable SIP requires a conscientious approach at all levels.
     1.1. Program Criteria: A SIP is beneficial if it does the following:
        1.1.1. Assigns SIP responsibilities.
        1.1.2. Is tailored to each unit’s structure and mission and contains mechanisms that
        ensure adequate periodic inspection coverage of the organization’s mission, resources,
        training and personnel programs. Mechanisms may consist of periodically administered
        checklists, quality control reviews, internal audits, functional inspections, management
        information systems, numerical summaries, analysis programs, etc.
        1.1.3. Establishes a method to identify, document, track and resolve deficiencies.
        1.1.4. Provides feedback to commanders.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Commander (341 MW/CC):
        2.1.1. Reviews/Approves Semi-Annual Self-Inspection Program Summary Reports.

            the appointment letter.
        2.2.2. Reviews critical and major SIP findings monthly and closes as appropriate.
     2.3. Wing SIP Monitor (341 MW/XP):
        2.3.1. Administers the 341 MW SIP and serves as the interface between 341 MW units
        and HQ AFGSC on matters concerning SIP.
        2.3.2. Manages the AFSPC SIP database and user accounts for the 341 MW.
        2.3.3. Develops SIP policy and guidance in the form of 341MWI90-101 and reviews it
        biennially.
        2.3.4. Conducts annual Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) of unit SIP programs to evaluate
        their effectiveness.
        2.3.5. Provides training to all SIP monitors on their duties and responsibilities.
        2.3.6. Distributes Air Force and AFGSC Special Interest Items (SIIs) to all SIP monitors.
        2.3.7. Reviews SIP findings monthly with the 341 MW/CV.
            2.3.7.1. Identifies deficiencies that have not been updated.

     2.4.1. The Director of Staff (341 MW/DS) or 341 MW/CV is the group-level reviewing
     authority for all wing staff agencies.
     2.4.2. Appoint SIP monitors (primary and alternate) in writing to manage the SIP and
     forward a copy of the appointment memorandum to the wing SIP monitor.
     2.4.3. Review squadron Semi-Annual Self-Inspection Program Summary Reports.
     2.4.4. Direct group self-inspections of any programs managed at the group level, as
     applicable. Reference paragraph 2.5.2.
     2.4.5. Conduct a monthly review of all open group discrepancies and all discrepancies
     recommended for closure by squadron commanders between the 16th and the 20th of
     each month.
        2.4.5.1. Ensure that monthly updates reflect corrective actions taken and evaluate if
        corrective actions are sufficient to warrant a closure recommendation.
        2.4.5.2. Refer deficiencies back to squadrons if further corrective actions are
        required.
     2.4.6. Recommend closure of critical and major SIP deficiencies within the group to the

     2.4.7. Due to the nature of 341 MDG, critical and major self-inspection findings and all

        functional area, and additional duty in the months of April and October.
        2.5.2.2. Ensure all checklist responses are justified or explained.           Every
        “yes/complies” response must be accompanied by an explanation of how the unit is in
        compliance. Every “no/does not comply” response must be accompanied by an
        explanation of the deviation and then be properly entered into the SIP database as a
        discrepancy. Briefly explain how items marked “N/A” do not apply to the unit.
        2.5.2.3. Provide Self-Inspection Program Summary Reports to the wing SIP monitor
        (see Attachment 2). Squadron commanders route through group commanders for
        endorsement.
        2.5.2.4. Conduct a monthly review of all open discrepancies and ensure the SIP
        database entries are updated between the 11th and the 15th of each month. Ensure
        monthly updates reflect corrective actions taken. Take aggressive corrective actions
        to resolve all discrepancies in a timely manner.
        2.5.2.5. Close minor SIP deficiencies within the squadron.
 4                                                          341MWI90-101 9 JANUARY 2012


            2.5.2.6. Recommend closure of all other deficiencies to the group commander or
            direct additional corrective actions within the unit.
     2.6. SIP Monitors and Functional Area Managers:
        2.6.1. SIP monitors manage SIP and maintain records in a continuity binder (see
        paragraph 4).
        2.6.2. SIP monitors ensure functional area managers (FAMs) are appointed in writing
        and maintain a copy of the appointment memorandum in the SIP binder. Additional duty
        appointment letters satisfy this requirement.
        2.6.3. Squadron and group SIP monitors draft the Self-Inspection Program Summary
        Reports (see Attachment #1) for the commander.
            2.6.3.1. Ensure FAMs have entered all self-inspection deficiencies into the SIP
            database, or enter them on their behalf, before presenting the report to the commander
            for signature.
            2.6.3.2. Provide a copy of all completed SIP checklists for commander review.
        2.6.4. Update all open database entries between the 1st and 10th of every month.

        than the 15th of the month. Provide status updates on all open deficiencies.
        2.6.6. Track open deficiencies until closed.
        2.6.7. Group SIP monitors brief group commanders on all group deficiencies and all
        squadron closure recommendations no later than the 20th of the month.
3. Checklist Development:
     3.1. Develop local checklists or tailor HAF and AFGSC checklists with unit-specific
     inspection items. Review all AFIs used for inspections before each self-inspection for
     currency. Ensure checklists reflect all requirements from all applicable instructions and
     HHQ guidance.
     3.2. List each checklist item as a single question, capable of being answered by either a
     “yes” or “no,” followed by a reference in parentheses. To aid in problem identification,
     questions should be worded so that compliance is indicated by a “yes” answer.
4. SIP Records: Maintain a SIP binder that contains the following:
     4.1. Table of contents or clearly labeled tabs.
     4.2. References:
        4.2.1. AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_1 (reference to where this is filed electronically is
        acceptable).
        4.2.2. Printed copy of 341MWI90-101, Commander’s Self-Inspection Program (SIP).
     4.3. Appointment letters for unit SIP monitor, FAMs, and subordinate unit SIP monitors.
     4.4. Checklists and Special Interest Items:
341MWI90-101 9 JANUARY 2012                                                               5


     4.4.1. All checklists used during SIP inspections. SIP monitors may maintain copies of
     all completed checklists in their SIP binder, or they may maintain them in the FAM
     program binders. A listing of all separately located checklists with their checklist
     number, publication date, and location will be maintained in the SIP monitor’s binder.
     4.4.2. Air Force and AFGSC SIIs (only if they apply to the unit). Maintain applicable
     SIIs for one year after closure.
  4.5. Reports:
     4.5.1. Completed Self-Inspection Program Summary Reports. Maintain copies for one
     year.
     4.5.2. Copy of any SAV report or any other formal inspections from 341 MW or external
     agencies (electronic version acceptable). Maintain copies for one year.
     4.5.3. Have readily available a copy of most recent unclassified 341 MW nuclear surety,
     operational readiness, and compliance inspection reports (electronic copy in SIPR
     acceptable for confidential/classified reports).
