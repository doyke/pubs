                                                Chapter 1

                               POLICY AND GENERAL STANDARDS

1.1. Applicability:
   1.1.1. This instruction contains criteria for design and construction of facilities on Air Force installa-
   tions (except family housing). Family housing criteria are contained in AFI 32-6002, Family Housing
   Programming, Design, and Construction (formerly AFR 88-25) , and Military Handbook 1190, Facil-
   ity Planning and Design Guide. The criteria in this chapter apply to all construction regardless of
   funding and also apply to:
       •   Properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
       •   Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve projects constructed on Air Force installations
           (Reserve and Active).
       •   Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve projects constructed on non-DoD property.
       1.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Command Standards. The Air Combat Command (ACC) Architectural
       and Interior Design Standards provide guidance for base appearance and any facility on ACC
       installations, tenants on ACC bases, and ACC units on other major command (MAJCOM) instal-
       lations. It covers all project types including Military Construction (MILCON), Operations and
       Management (O&M), Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF), P-341, and any base or tenant support by
       contract, in-house, Self-Help, Guard or Reserve Forces or Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy
       Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED HORSE) resources. ACC bases may establish
       stricter standards if they desire.
       1.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Regulatory Guidelines: The ACC Architectural and Interior Design
       Standards do not provide comprehensive technical information generally known to professional
       architects, planners, engineers and interior designers. This guide does not provide all the informa-
       tion needed to design and execute a successful project, but should be used in conjunction with
       other documents and project specific criteria. All ACC projects must comply with regulatory
       guidelines such as the local building code; the National Electric Code; Air Force Policy Directive
       (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and Facilities; Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 32-1008, Installa-
       tion Design; Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-1023, Design and Construction Standards and Execu-
       tion of Facility Construction Projects; AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming of Facility
       Construction Projects; AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming Nonappropriated Fund Facility
       Construction Projects; AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Mainte-
       nance, Repair, and Construction Projects; AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements; Air
       Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-1097, Sign Standards Pamphlet; AFI 32-7062, Air Force Compre-
       hensive Planning; the Interim Department of Defense Antiterrorism/Force Protection Construc-
       tion Standards; the Air Force Installation Force Protection Guide; Air Combat Command
       Instruction (ACCI) 32-1054, Exterior Signs; the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards
       (UFAS); the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); Military Handbook 1008C; National Fire
       Protection Agency (NFPA) 101; NFPA 1141; and the Uniform Building Code. This list is not
       meant to be all-inclusive. Architects, planners, engineers, and designers should check with their
       Design Agent or government project manager for the latest guidelines.
8                                                              AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


    1.1.2. These criteria apply to all Air Force installations in the fifty states, the District of Columbia,
    Puerto Rico, US territories and possessions, and as far as practical, at Air Force installations in foreign
    countries. In foreign countries, use local materials and construction methods if they produce econom-
    ical, energy efficient and safe facilities.

1.2. Space Criteria. Use AFH 32-1084, Standard Facility Requirements Handbook (formerly AFR
86-2), to determine space requirements instead of Military Handbook 1190. For Air National Guard facil-
ities, use ANG (AF) 86-2, National Guard Planning Factors.

1.3. Design Excellence. Excellence in design is a primary goal for all construction projects. Reaching
this goal requires a commitment by designers and administrators to quality architecture. Design new
facilities in harmony with the architectural character of existing facilities and the environment.
    1.3.1. Pay particular attention to: siting, economy, life cycle cost, functionality, energy conservation,
    interior and exterior details, and disabled access.
    1.3.2. Take special care to avoid adversely affecting the historic value of property listed (or eligible
    for listing) on the National Register of Historic Places, or located within the boundaries of an Historic
    District.

1.4. Design Flexibility. The Air Force usually owns and operates facilities from the time of construction
until the end of the structure's useful life. Over that period, the functional requirements of a building may
change drastically. For this reason, flexibility is a major design requirement for all buildings.

1.5. Selection of Materials and Components. Select economical materials by considering:
    •   Life cycle costs.
    •   Functional requirements.
    •   Fire safety.
    •   Expected length of use.
    •   Energy conservation and environmental factors (including renewable energy sources, local cli-
        matic conditions and construction practices).
    •   Environmental factors.
    •   Appearance.
    •   Maintainability.
    •   Recyclable materials (refer to AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Programs (formerly AFR
        19-15).
Use standardized structural, mechanical, and electrical systems and equipment wherever practicable.

1.6. Categories of Construction. To ensure the right kind of construction is programmed, classify each
project in one of four categories of construction.
    1.6.1. Permanent. This category of construction is required for most facilities at Air Force installa-
    tions in the United States. and its possessions. Permanent facilities:
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                       9


       •   Use design and construction quality suitable for a facility with a minimum life expectancy of
           25 years with low maintenance requirements.
       •   Show reasonable cost, justified by a life-cycle cost approach.
       •   Use energy-efficient, environmental-, health-, and fire-safe design and conform to the require-
           ments for non-combustible construction.
   1.6.2. Semipermanent. Semipermanent facilities are used during peacetime in US possessions,
   where permanent construction is not economically justified; where structures have a high potential for
   obsolescence; and in foreign countries according to mutual intergovernmental agreements. Semiper-
   manent facilities:
       •   Are structurally sound, energy efficient, and fire-, environmental- and health-safe.
       •   Cost less to build than permanent construction.
       •   Have a life expectancy more than 5 but less than 25 years with moderate maintenance.
       •   Normally use economical masonry, steel, or wood frame components.
       •   Are easy to maintain with economical but serviceable finishes.
   1.6.3. Temporary. Temporary facilities are low-cost structures for temporary use (less than 5 years)
   at Air Force installations worldwide, where the cost of operation may be relatively high, but mainte-
   nance is not a primary design consideration. Use of combustible materials is allowed, consistent with
   safeguarding life and property.
   1.6.4. Protective. Protective construction uses passive methods and materials to:
       •   Reduce or nullify the effects of an attack on an installation
       •   Enhance recoverability of the installation after attack.
       1.6.4.1. Protective construction includes:
           •   Separating and duplicating structures and activities.
           •   Strengthening (hardening) structures.
           •   Camouflaging or "toning down" painting.
           •   Physical protection against chemical, biological, and radiological agents.
       1.6.4.2. Protective construction does not include all elements of passive defense, such as control
       of electronic emissions, use of protective clothing, and so on.

1.7. Preservation of Historic Resources:
   1.7.1. Requirements for Compliance. DoD Directive 4710.1, Archaeological and Historic
   Resources Management, provides policy, prescribes procedures, and assigns responsibilities for man-
   aging archaeological and historic resources in and on waters and lands under DoD control. The Sec-
   retary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings
   may also apply; consult AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Management.
   1.7.2. Required Coordination. Coordinate all activities involving historic properties with the State
   Historic Preservation Officer. After coordination, obtain the comments of the Federal Advisory
10                                                              AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


     Council on Historic Preservation (reference 36 CFR 800, Protection of Historic and Cultural Proper-
     ties).
     1.7.3. Historic Preservation Plan and Archaeological Survey. Coordinate all construction, main-
     tenance, repair, rehabilitation, alteration, or addition work to a district, site, building, structure, or
     object with the installation Historic Preservation Plan for possible adverse effects. When appropriate,
     conduct archaeological surveys to verify whether archaeological features are present at construction
     sites.

1.8. Voluntary Standards. When practicable, use commercial voluntary standards instead of Govern-
ment-developed standards and specifications.

1.9. Model Building Codes. Comply with Air Force standards for design and construction and Military
Handbook 1190. If applicable standards are not available, comply with the current edition of the Building
Officials and Code Administrators code. For Air National Guard facilities, design to the locally-applica-
ble standard building code. Comply with local building codes where practical when constructing within
urban areas. In case of a conflict between Air Force standards and local building codes, the more strin-
gent requirement shall apply.

1.10. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Program. AFI 91-301, The US Air Force Occupa-
tional Safety, Fire Prevention, and Health Program (formerly AFR 127-12), establishes the Air Force
Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) program. The AFOSH program applies to all levels and orga-
nizations of the Air Force. AFI 91-302, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standards (formerly
AFR 8-14), establishes Air Force occupational safety and health standards. If no applicable standard is
available, refer to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. If no applicable
OSHA standard is available, refer to nationally recognized sources of health and safety criteria.

1.11. Fire Protection. This instruction implements Military Handbook 1008, Fire Protection for Facili-
ties Engineering, Design, and Construction.

1.12. Life Cycle Cost. Base design decisions on life cycle cost considerations. Studies must balance ini-
tial construction cost with the operating and maintenance costs over the anticipated life of the facility to
provide facilities at optimum cost. The anticipated life of the facility may exceed the 25 year minimum
life expectancy for permanent construction.

1.13. Economic Analysis. Conduct economic analyses routinely during the design process to ensure that
design alternatives are based on the total cost of ownership. Use the present value discounting approach
described in AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis and Program Evaluation for Resource Management (for-
merly AFR 173-15), and AFP 178-8, Economic Procedures Handbook, unless otherwise specified.

1.14. Asbestos Materials. Use of asbestos-containing materials may result in excessive exposure for
construction and maintenance personnel or building occupants. When exposure to asbestos fibers may
occur from maintenance, repair or demolition operations, notify the Bioenvironmental Engineering Ser-
vices office, and follow requirements and work practices in:
     •   AFI 32-1052, Facility Asbestos Management (formerly AFR 91-42).
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                    11


  •   AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Prevention, and Health Pro-
      gram (formerly AFR 127-12).
  •   The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 CFR 1926.58).
  •   EPA 40 CFR 763G, Asbestos Abatement Projects.
  1.14.1. Asbestos Removal Projects. Where the Bioenvironmental Engineering Services office
  determines that asbestos-containing materials pose a hazard, remove these materials. The Bioenvi-
  ronmental Engineering Services office approves methods and procedures.
  1.14.2. Substitution Studies. Where using nonfriable asbestos-containing material may result in
  worker or building occupant exposure above OSHA or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stan-
  dards and guidelines, conduct a substitution study to justify its use. Carefully evaluate each planned
  use of asbestos-containing material to determine if an asbestos-free material can be used. Compare
  costs, performance characteristics, and actual or potential health hazards (including eventual demoli-
  tion or removal at the end of the item's life) for each material. When an asbestos-containing material
  is clearly superior in performance and cost and doesn't present a health hazard to workers or building
  occupants, use the asbestos-containing material. When performance and cost for an asbestos-contain-
  ing material nearly equals an asbestos-free material, use the asbestos-free material.
  1.14.3. Documentation. Document all asbestos materials identified in facilities by the Base Civil
  Engineer and the Bioenvironmental Engineering Services office. Keep files, reports, studies, or other
  documents about asbestos.
  1.14.4. (Added-ACC) Special Paragraph. The ACC Architectural and Interior Design Standards
  must be followed in all these circumstances unless a waiver is obtained from HQ ACC/CE. All waiver
  requests must be a signed letter by the Base Civil Engineer of the requesting ACC base or the unit
  commander for units not on ACC bases. Submit the waiver request to HQ ACC/CE, 129 Andrews
  Street, Suite 102, Langley AFB, VA. 23665-2769. Submit the waiver request early in the design pro-
  cess, at least by the 35 percent design stage. Allow a minimum of 20 working days from the date of
  receipt for processing.

     AIR FORCE ENGINEERING TECHNICAL LETTERS (ETL) AND TECHNICAL DATA

2.1. Engineering Technical Letter:.
     2.1.1. Purpose. The ETL system provides specific design guidance, procedures, criteria, and stan-
     dards.
     2.1.2. Applicability. ETLs apply to all facilities constructed on Air Force installations except for
     family housing. ETLs are directive and apply to all levels of command, unless stated otherwise. An
     ETL remains in effect as long as it states, or until canceled, rescinded, or superseded by a later ETL.
     ETLs are distributed to major commands, design agents, and other special interest organizations.
     2.1.3. Responsibilities:
        2.1.3.1. HQ USAF/CE Field Operating Agencies:
            •   Determine need for ETLs.

                                                   Chapter 3

                      SELECTING ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING (A-E) FIRMS

3.1. Scope. This chapter provides detailed guidance for selecting A-E firms and negotiating contracts at
active Air Force and Air Force Reserve installations. It implements 40 U.S.C. 541-544, Federal Acquisi-
tion Regulation (FAR) subpart 36.6, and the applicable portions of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)
and Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS). The Air National Guard complies with ANG (AF) 88-1, Cri-
teria and Standards for Air National Guard Construction, through the US Property and Fiscal Office in
each state.

3.2. Definitions. FAR 36.102 provides definitions of professional and other A-E services. Other defini-
tions:
     •   Title I: These services are related to a specific construction project and consists of conducting
         field surveys and investigations to obtain design data, and preparing contract plans, specifications,
         and cost estimates.
     •   Title II: These services are related to a specific or proposed construction project and consists of
         supervision and inspection of construction.
     •   Base Comprehensive Plans: These services consist of conducting field surveys and investigations
         to obtain data and producing Air Base development plans.
     •   Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction related but are not connected
         with a specific construction project. The services consist of developing design criteria, fact find-
         ing studies, surveys, investigations, and the performance of environmental projects involving pre-
         vention, compliance, and restoration when the services of registered architects or engineers are
         required. Excluded are services that need not be performed by a registered engineer or architect
         such as providing design and construction equipment or computer programs.

3.3. Authorities:
     3.3.1. Title 10, U.S.C., sections 2807(a) and 9540(a), authorizes contracting for and administration of
     A-E services for project design. Title 10, U.S.C., section 9540(b) limits the portion of the A-E's fee
     for producing contract plans and specifications to 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction
     project. This doesn't include site investigations, studies, and surveys.
     3.3.2. Title 40, U.S.C., paragraphs 541-544, the Brooks Act, provides the authority, definitions, and
     basic procedures for the Federal Government's selection of A-E firms for professional services on
     facilities projects. Title 10, U.S.C., section 2855(a) applies the Brooks Act to military construction.
     3.3.3. FAR subpart 36.6 implements the Brooks Act by providing detailed procedures for:
         •   Submitting A-E qualification data and performance evaluations.
         •   Functioning of evaluation board(s).
         •   A-E selection criteria.
         •   A-E selection approval.
         •   Contract negotiation.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                     15


       •   Government cost estimates.
   It also covers clauses on responsibility for redesign and liability for design errors or deficiencies,
   design within funding limitations, oversight of A-E's work, and registration of designers.
   3.3.4. DFARS subpart 236.6 adds to the FAR:
       •   Selection criteria based on A-E expertise and experience, status as a small or small disadvan-
           taged firm, and the volume of previous DoD work.
       •   A special approval requirement when the design contract cost exceeds $500,000.
       •   Application to Military Construction (MILCON) of provisions for small business set-aside
           when the design contract cost is less than $85,000 [10 U.S.C. 2855(b)].
       •   Notifying Congress when the estimated A-E fee is $300,000 or more [10 U.S.C. 2807(b)].
   3.3.5. Advance approval of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Environmental Security) is
   required to use a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract estimated to exceed $25,000.

   3.4.2. Preselection Board. When the estimated A-E fee exceeds $25,000 (the small purchase limit),
   this board:
       •   Develops an evaluation procedure and conducts an evaluation of A-E candidates.
       •   Recommends three to six qualified A-Es to the selection board in a summary report.
   3.4.3. Selection Board. This board of registered engineers and architects:
       •   Evaluates and may interview the A-E firms on the preselection board list.
       •   Recommends three firms for selection authority approval.

3.5. Procedures:
   3.5.1. The preselection and selection boards decide the specific professional qualifications and capa-
   bilities necessary to accomplish the statement of work. The boards base their evaluations on:
       •   Information in the SFs 254, 255, and 1421 (or the DD Form 2631) from previous projects.

        •   Other data submitted per the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) synopsis.
        •   Interviews with A-E firms.
     3.5.2. The boards use the same procedures for all A-E firms considered. While the boards may mod-
     ify evaluation factors or add them (if they're stated in the CBD announcement) for a project, the
     boards must consider these essential factors listed in FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1:
        •   Professional qualifications.
        •   Specialized experience and technical competence.
        •   Capacity for timely accomplishment of work.
        •   Past performance.
        •   Geographic location.
        •   Volume of DoD work the candidate has done.
     3.5.3. The preselection board reviews all candidates and sends its recommendations to the selection
     board, which interviews each firm, either in person, by telephone, or by written reply to written ques-
     tions. Interviews cover:
        •   Required services.
        •   The firm's technical qualifications and experience with similar work.
        •   The firm's organization, capacity, and current workload.
        •   Key individuals who will work on the project.
        •   Design concepts the firm intends to use.
        •   The relative value of alternative approaches.
     3.5.4. Either short selection process described in FAR 36.602-5 may be used to select firms for con-
     tracts not expected to exceed the small purchase limitation (AFFARS 5336.602.5).
     3.5.5. The chairperson of each board must be a registered professional engineer or architect. The
     chairperson:
        •   Prepares a summary report of board activities, marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.
        •   Screens prospective board members to avoid potential conflict of interest.
        •   Uses careful judgment when assigning non-US. employees to boards.
     3.5.6. A person may not be a voting member of both boards for the same project.
     3.5.7. The Contracting Officer or his designee is a nonvoting member of the final selection board.

3.6. A-E Slate Selection Approving Authority. Approval authority for A-E slate selections is delegated
as follows:
     3.6.1. For Title I, Title, II, and Base Comprehensive Plan A-E services where the fee exceeds
     $500,000, The Civil Engineer, Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF/CE) is the A-E slate selection
     approving authority for Headquarters Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (HQ AFCEE)
     and Headquarters Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (HQ AFCESA) contracts. When the fee
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                        17


   is less than $500,000, the Commander (HQ AFCEE/CC or HQ AFCESA/CC) may approve the slate
   selection.
   3.6.2. For Title I, Title II, and Base Comprehensive Plan A-E services where the fee exceeds
   $500,000, the Major Command (MAJCOM) Civil Engineer is the A-E slate selection approving
   authority for MAJCOM contracts. When the fee is less than $500,000, the MAJCOM may delegate
   selection slate approval authority to the Base Civil Engineer.
   3.6.3. For other A-E services contracts where the fee exceeds $300,000, Deputy Assistant Secretary/
   Installations (SAF/MII) is the A-E slate selection approving authority. When the fee is less than
   $300,000, HQ USAF/CE is the A-E slate selection approving authority.
   3.6.4. The maximum A-E fee permitted under a contract is the basis for approval level and authority.
   On Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, base the fee on the initial plus renewal
   values of the contract. For example, a 2-year, $400,000 per year, IDIQ contract by a base would have
   a potential value of $800,000, and require approval by the MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
   3.6.5. All contracts requiring HQ USAF/CE or SAF/MII approval need two written approvals: the
   requirements, and the slate. Submit the following for approval. All approving authorities should
   review similar data before approving a slate.
       3.6.5.1. Obtain approval of the requirement before procurement action, submitting an explanation
       of why the work is needed, the basis for the contract scope, the length of the contract, and the min-
       imum and maximum quantity of work allowed under the contract. Include with the approval
       request a copy of the draft notice for the CBD, and the proposed selection factors and criteria and
       their weighted values.
       3.6.5.2. To ensure selection boards were professionally qualified to evaluate the A-E firms and
       the process was fair and equitable, slate approving authorities should review the following data
       before granting approval:
          •   A copy of the CBD announcement.
          •   A copy of the contract statement of work.
          •   Preselection and final selection board minutes.
          •   A listing of all board members by name, grade, professional discipline, organization, and
              whether members were registered as an architect or engineer.
          •   The letter of designation.
          •   A listing of all firms considered by the final selection board, including their status as a
              small or disadvantaged business, if applicable.
          •   The selection factors and criteria and their weighted values.
          •   Board member scorecards.
          •   Summary of members scoring and ranking of firms.
          •   Questions asked during A-E interviews.
          •   The slate in rank order.

        initial award.
        3.7.2.3. Under this type of contract, the contractor earns a minimum fee as per FAR 16.504.
        3.7.2.4. The delivery order (which may include one or more work orders) limitation must comply
        with AFFARS 5336.691, except the initial order when described in the CBD synopsis.
        3.7.2.5. A-Es receive contracts of 1 year with an optional 1-year extension.
        3.7.2.6. Yearly fees may not exceed the limitation in AFFARS 5336.691.
        3.7.2.7. Select A-Es according to the procedures for award of contracts over $25,000.
        3.7.2.8. State in the synopsis if the Contracting Officer may award multiple contracts from a sin-
        gle synopsis or notice of intent to contract [FAR 5.203(e)].
        3.7.2.9. Negotiate, in order of priority, with the firms listed on the final slate for each separate
        award.
     3.7.3. Environmental Compliance, Prevention, And Restoration Projects. IDIQ contracts follow
     the rules in paragraphs 3.6.2.1, 3.6.2.2, and 3.6.2.7 through 3.6.2.9, and the following:

                                      DESIGN MANAGEMENT

Section 5A—Guidance Applicable to All Included Programs

5.1. Design Standards and Criteria. Designers use Chapter 1 of this instruction; Military Handbook
1190, Facility Planning and Design; AFM 88-43 , Installation Design; and Engineering Technical Letters
(ETL) for guidance in preparing contract documentation. Major Commands (MAJCOM) provide func-
tional criteria. The Base Civil Engineer provides designers with local design guidance covering such
areas as architectural compatibility and aesthetics, the Base Comprehensive Plan, and maintainability.
See Chapter 7 of this instruction for medical Military Construction (MILCON) projects.

5.2. Standard Designs. Use standard designs, whether site-adapted or standard modules, that meet oper-
ational or functional requirements, when practical.

5.3. Environmental Quality Standards. All designs must meet:
   •   Applicable Federal, state, interstate, and local environmental standards and regulations in the
       United States, its trust territories, and possessions.
   •   Host nation standards and regulations in overseas locations or US Environmental Protection
       Agency (EPA) standards, whichever are stricter.

5.4. Energy Efficiency. Designers will:
   •   Consider energy efficiency in all new facilities.
   •   Apply energy efficiency to revitalization and modification projects to the maximum extent possi-
       ble.
   •   Comply with the standards in 42 U.S.C. 6834, Energy Conservation Standards for Existing Build-
       ings, when renovating buildings or designing new buildings.
   •   Evaluate renewable forms of energy in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2857, Use of Renewable Forms
       of Energy in New Facilities.

5.5. Design Funds. Pay the design cost from the same program (Operation and Maintenance [O&M],
MILCON, or nonappropriated funds] that funds the facility construction (3400 or 3600, 3300, or nonap-
propriated funds). For MILCON (P-321 and P-331 Funds) and minor construction (P-341 Funds)
projects, use P-313 (design) funds for design services and not for advanced planning functions. The
O&M account funds must be used for advance planning to support MILCON projects.

5.6. Design Reviews. The Design Agent is responsible for technical adequacy on all projects. The user
is responsible for functional adequacy.
   5.6.1. On MILCON projects, the Air Force may perform technical review when special expertise or
   local conditions justify this requirement.
22                                                             AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


     5.6.2. The MAJCOMs provide technical approval of all O&M and MAJCOM-funded nonappropri-
     ated fund projects, but may request technical assistance from HQ AFCESA/EN or Headquarters Air
     Force Center for Environmental Excellence Design Group (HQ AFCEE/DG).
     5.6.3. Joint Project Review. If lack of funding or other reasons delay by 120 or more calendar days
     a completely designed project from going to the contracting stage, the Base Contracting Officer, Base
     Civil Engineer, and user should jointly review the project again immediately before sending it to the
     contracting office.
     5.6.4. Floodplains and Wetlands Regulations. All Air Force construction projects in the US and its
     territories must conform with Executive Orders 11988, Floodplains Management, and 11990, Protec-
     tion of Wetlands.

5.7. Maintaining the Currency of Data in the Information Management System:
     5.7.1. Programming, Design, and Construction. Programming, Design, and Construction (PDC) is
     a management information system used by the Air Staff, MAJCOMs, Design Managers, and Con-
     struction Managers to provide:
        •   Management assessments of project cost.
        •   Dates of major milestones (both estimated and actual milestones are included).
        •   Information to help concerned organizations manage their projects.
        •   Data for Management Decisions
     5.7.2. Definitions:
        5.7.2.1. In design, the current working estimate (shown in PDC as the basic current working esti-
        mate) is the estimated cost to construct a complete facility. The current working estimate with
        additives (shown in the PDC as basic plus adds) is the estimated cost for the complete facility with
        additional amenities.
        5.7.2.2. In construction, the current working estimate provides the costs to complete the project
        under contract.

5.8. Controlling Costs:
     5.8.1. The Congress approves each project at a specific authorized and appropriated amount. Project
     obligations may not exceed a designated threshold amount without Congressional reapproval.
     5.8.2. A cost variation (10 U.S.C. 2853) is a change to the cost authorized for a MILCON project
     when the current working estimate of a project exceeds the authorization threshold or the scope is
     reduced by more than 25 percent of the congressionally approved scope. Prior congressional approval
     is not necessary for:
        •   Actions below the authorization threshold.
        •   Cost increases due solely to final settlement of a contractor's claim.
        •   Projects that the Construction Agent is completing in their entirety with obligated funds in an
            expired status.
     5.8.3. Requiring MAJCOMs aim to minimize cost increases by:
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                   23


       •   Involving users during the early stages of programming and design.
       •   Ensuring that the project definition fully describes all user requirements.
       •   Conducting effective design reviews and value engineering studies.
       •   Processing change requests promptly.
   5.8.4. Changes must meet the bona fide need rule and are funded from an appropriation depending
   upon the funding year (the fiscal year in which Congress funded the project) and the type of change.
   Consult the Program Management Division, Directorate of Military Construction (HQ USAF/CECM)
   or Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller) for Budget,
   Investment Directorate, Assistant for Construction (SAF/FMBIC) with questions on the proper use of
   prior year appropriations ("good year", expired, canceled).

5.9. Change Control:
   5.9.1. Scope Changes:
       5.9.1.1. MAJCOM Civil Engineers may approve increases in scope to 10 percent; and decreases
       in scope not exceeding 25 percent.
       5.9.1.2. Design Managers and Construction Managers send all requests for Air Force Reserve
       projects to the Directorate of Programs and Resources (HQ USAF/REX), 1150 Air Force Penta-
       gon, Washington DC 20330-1150, for approval.
       5.9.1.3. HQ USAF/CEC/REX may approve increases in scope between 10 and 25 percent.
       5.9.1.4. Congress must approve increases or decreases in scope exceeding 25 percent.
       5.9.1.5. When the MAJCOM or HQ USAF/CEC/REX approves increases in scope, the cost
       increase may not exceed the limits of program flexibility without processing a reprogramming
       request (paragraph 5.9.2.).
       5.9.1.6. For minor construction projects, costs may not exceed the $1.5 million Congressional
       ceiling.
   5.9.2. Reprogramming. The Construction Manager or Design Manager submits a reprogramming
   request when the current working estimate based on opened bids will exceed the appropriation thresh-
   old. When the appropriation and the authorization differ, the lesser amount controls. The Design
   Manager or Construction Manager and the requiring MAJCOM prepare the reprogramming request.

5.10. Resiting. MAJCOMs approve facility siting and resiting per AFI 32-7062, Base Comprehensive
Planning (formerly AFR 86-4).

5.11. Interior Design. The Design Manager obtains professional design services in accordance with the
current ETL on Air Force interior design policy. The requiring MAJCOM identifies projects to receive
full Comprehensive Interior Design and approves the interior design package.

5.12. Constructibility Reviews:
24                                                              AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


     5.12.1. Purpose. To ensure clarity of plans and specifications so that the design reflects a construct-
     ible facility and reduced modifications during construction which lead to higher costs and delayed
     contract completion.
     5.12.2. Responsibilities. The Design Agent, including the Base Civil Engineer, performs a construc-
     tibility review.
     5.12.3. Checklist. The current Construction Technical Letter (CTL) 88-7 on constructibility review
     lists items that a Design Manager or a Design Agent needs to check during a constructibility review.

5.13. Maintainability Reviews. The Base Civil Engineer Operations and Engineer flights jointly over-
see maintainability and reliability issues. They may use ETL 88-4, Reliability and Maintainability
(R&M) Design Checklist, during this review. The Base Civil Engineer annotates the project file with the
date of the review, all comments and recommendations made, and the results.

5.14. Value Engineering:
     5.14.1. Policy. The Air Force supports a strong value engineering program to provide cost-effective
     facilities. The goal of value engineering for all Air Force projects is to reduce the cost of facility own-
     ership without reducing quality:
        5.14.1.1. The requiring MAJCOM identifies projects for value engineering study and either con-
        ducts the study in-house or provides planning and design funds to the Design Agent. The MAJ-

             CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT ACCEPTANCE

Section 6A—Construction Management Procedures

6.1. Construction Funding. Headquarters US Air Force [Office of the Reserve, Programs and
Resources Directorate (HQ USAF/REX) for Air Force Reserve projects; Office of The Civil Engineer,
Directorate of Military Construction (HQ USAF/CEC) otherwise] authorizes issuing construction funds
to the Construction Agents. Funds are designated P-321 for projects in the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii; and
P-331 for overseas projects. The Construction Agent uses P-321 or P-331 funds for:
   •   The construction contract.
   •   The Construction Agent's fee (Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead) for administering contracts
       and overseeing construction activity.
   •   Architect-Engineer (A-E) construction supervision and inspection services (Title II as described
       in Chapter 3).
   •   Required A-E design after awarding construction (engineering and design or post-contract award
       services).

6.2. Construction Changes. Once construction is underway the following types of changes are
approved and funded as follows:
   •   Construction Agent Changes. Approved by the Construction Agent and funded with project
       contingency funds.
   •   Construction Agent Change Request. Submitted by the Construction Agent, approved by the
       Construction Manager and funded with project contingency funds.
   •   Air Force Change Request. Approved by the requiring MAJCOM and funded using project
       management reserve funds.

6.3. Construction Management Plans. During project design, the Design Manager develops a Con-
struction Management Plan for large or complicated projects and for those which will have a resident
Construction Manager. This plan is coordinated with the MAJCOM, HQ USAF/CEC or HQ USAF/REX,
and the Construction Agent. In developing the Construction Management Plan, the Design Manager
evaluates and justifies the need for a resident Construction Manager (for HQ USAF/CEC or REX
approval) and assigns resident Construction Manager responsibilities.

Section 6C—Acceptance Procedures

6.9. Applicable Programs. This section outlines the procedures and responsibilities for transferring and
accepting constructed facilities.

6.10. Types of MILCON Acceptance Inspections. MILCON projects require preliminary, prefinal, and
final inspections. The Construction Manager must ensure the participants receive a timely invitation for
any of these inspections.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                         35


   6.10.1. Preliminary Inspection. The Construction Agent and Air Force personnel identify deficien-
   cies, establish standards of quality for acceptance and mutually agree on a Beneficial Occupancy
   Date. The construction contractor does not attend.
   6.10.2. Prefinal Inspection. The Construction Agent and the contractor conduct a detailed and thor-
   ough inspection to identify construction deficiencies and remaining contractual items (such as sys-
   tems operating manuals, spare parts lists, as-built drawings, and training requirements). During the
   inspection they document deficiencies on a "punchlist."
   6.10.3. Final Inspection. The Construction Agent conducts this inspection with the Construction
   Manager, the Base Civil Engineer, the user, the base communications-computer systems officer, and
   the construction contractor. The Base Civil Engineer or the designated representative accepts the
   facility for the Air Force on DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, if
   satisfied the facility meets requirements and the plan to fix deficiencies is reasonable.

6.11. Acceptance Procedures for Non-MILCON Projects. MAJCOMs must supplement this instruc-
tion to establish procedures for accepting these projects.

6.12. Joint Occupancy:
   6.12.1. Approval. The Construction Manager may approve joint occupancy when it is advantageous
   to the Government.
   6.12.2. Joint Occupancy Date. The Construction Manager (working with the host or requiring
   MAJCOM) and the construction agent jointly determine the joint occupancy date.
   6.12.3. Facility Maintenance Responsibility. When agreeing to joint occupancy, the Air Force
   assumes responsibility for maintenance and repair of items not under warranty and for operations of
   portions of the facility occupied during joint occupancy.
   6.12.4. Contractor Occupancy After Joint Occupancy. When the Air Force agrees to let a contrac-
   tor continue to occupy or use a facility after it has accepted the facility, for any purpose other than to
   finish correcting deficiencies, the Air Force treats the contractor as a tenant and receives payment
   (according to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, US Air Force Budget Policies and Procedures[formerly AFR
   172-1, Volume 1 and AFR 172-8]) for any logistical support the Air Force provides to the contractor.

Section 6D—Construction Quality

6.13. Responsibilities. Everyone is responsible for quality.

6.14. Quality Assurance. Government personnel (from the Construction Agent for MILCON and from
the Base Civil Engineer otherwise) perform quality assurance and serve as the Contracting Officer's rep-
resentative.
   6.14.1. Construction quality assurance inspector:
       •   Ensures the quality control system functions properly and produces the specified end product.
       •   Coordinates the contractor's activities with base agencies.
       •   Observes the contractor's activities and reports deviations and hazardous practices to the Con-
           tracting Officer.

        •   Recommends final acceptance.
        •   Uses the knowledge, expertise, and experience of both the project design architects or engi-
            neers and those maintaining base facilities to ensure the contractor provides the quality con-
            struction that the contract documents specify.

6.15. Post-Occupancy Inspections:
     6.15.1. Requirement. A post-occupancy evaluation team conducts post-occupancy inspections 9 to
     11 months after the contractor completes construction. The purpose of a post-occupancy evaluation
     team inspection is to identify design or functional deficiencies and "lessons learned."
     6.15.2. Responsibilities. The MAJCOM authorizes post-occupancy inspections and the Construction
     Manager invites participants from all interested agencies (including the Construction Agent) who can
     benefit from the future incorporation of noteworthy factors resulting from this inspection. The Con-
     struction Manager summarizes "lessons learned" and distributes them to the Air Staff Civil Engineer,
     Field Operating Agency Directors, concerned MAJCOMs, and all Base Civil Engineers. The Con-
     struction Manager sends items of interest concerning Military Handbook 1190 or criteria to HQ
     USAF/CEC and to HQ AFCESA/EN. Base Civil Engineer personnel check 1-year warranty items
     even when a post-occupancy evaluation team inspection doesn't take place.

   the appropriate Design Agent and Construction Agent provides project management and technical
38                                                          AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


     oversight for medical MILCON projects. Other Design Agent and Construction Agent roles and
     responsibilities are similar to regular Air Force MILCON projects.

7.4. Policy and Criteria. Military Handbook 1191 is the primary source for policy and criteria for med-
ical MILCON projects. It provides general guidance, submittal requirements, design criteria, and con-
struction management procedures. Military Handbook 1191 is supplemented by Military Handbook
1190, Facility Planning and Design Guide, this instruction, and Engineering Technical Letters (ETL).

7.5. Functional Requirements. HQ AFMSA/SGSF and OASD(HA) jointly develop a Program for
Design, indicating room-by-room space requirements, and a Medical Facility Room Contents Listing,
indicating room-by-room equipment requirements. With input from the Base Medical Group and the
MAJCOM Surgeon General, OASD(HA) provides final approval of the Program for Design. HQ
AFMSA/SGSF develops a Design Narrative, describing functional and departmental relationships, with
input from the Base Medical Group.

7.6. Project Authorizations. OASD(HA) issues all design and construction authorizations, including
Architect-Engineer selection, design initiation, and contract advertising and award.

7.7. Design Approvals. OASD(HA) reviews and approves concept designs, and approves significant
changes in project scope due to changes in concepts of operation and addition or deletion of medical func-
tions.

7.8. Construction Changes. OASD(HA) must approve construction changes over $100,000 or that
exceed available contingency funds, and changes that add new medical services to a project, or exceed
approved scope or cost. Construction changes less than $100,000 are approved by the Design Manager or
Construction Manager.

7.9. Base Realignment and Closure Program. Medical projects in the Base Realignment and Closure
Program (BRAC) program receive funding from the Air Force BRAC MILCON program. However,
design and construction submittal procedures generally follow the medical MILCON procedures. The
Design Manager or Construction Manager acquires the required funding and issues all design and con-
struction authorizations to the design agent or construction agent.

7.10. Medical Unspecified Minor Construction Requirements. Process Medical Unspecified Minor
Construction (P-341) design and construction projects like medical MILCON projects, with OASD(HA)
providing all design and construction authorizations.

                                       Chapter 8 (Added-ACC)

                              ACC ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS

8.1. (Added-ACC) Architectural Design Policy:
   8.1.1. (Added-ACC) General. The special character of defense installations dictates compatibility
   over personal style. The limited size and function of ACC bases cannot accept the diverse opinions of
   the many design professionals without becoming cluttered and unsettled. In this context, "good
   design" is defined as design that contributes to the overall harmony and appearance of the base rather
   than design that attracts individual attention. Good examples of where ACC goals should lead are col-
   lege campuses and corporate office parks. Because we do not want monotony, every building does not
   have to be the same, but some common architectural element or theme should tie all buildings
   together to create architectural compatibility and enhance base appearance. Buildings that hold special
   importance on the base such as wing headquarters and chapels should stand out as object buildings.
   Other buildings should function as background buildings. All buildings should be aesthetically attrac-
   tive, convenient and logically laid out, technically sound, compatible with their environment and built
   with long-lasting materials and details that reduce life cycle costs. Responsible design and attention to
   detail will achieve this goal.
   8.1.2. (Added-ACC) Site Conditions. Provide site improvements and building forms appropriate to
   any new, future or existing buildings. Facilities having similar or related functions should be located
   in the same vicinity. Do not let parking dominate. Encourage pedestrian access. Relate building forms
   to each other. Create small clusters of related buildings as opposed to spreading buildings out across
   the landscape.
      8.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Environmental. Design facilities in ways to enhance environmental
      quality and minimize consumption of natural resources. Tightly cluster buildings that are related
      to each other creating walkable campuses. These clusters will reduce the amount of land use, util-
      ity costs to run utilities to large expanses of land, and vehicle costs to move from building to build-
      ing.
      8.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Layouts. Provide functional layouts that are logical and satisfy users'
      needs both inside and outside of the facility as well as layouts that have the ability to accommo-
      date other future users. Anticipate and plan for expansion.
      8.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) Low Maintenance. Use permanent low-maintenance exteriors that are
      compatible with ACC base standards and their natural and manmade environments. Use materials
      that do not require painting during their lifetime. Emphasize low life-cycle costs. Use indigenous
      landscaping that requires little or no irrigation and little or no maintenance.
      8.1.2.4. (Added-ACC) Aesthetics. Design buildings that are aesthetically attractive using mate-
      rials that are indigenous to the local area or the function of the base. Follow the Base Architectural
      Standards. Keep in mind that all buildings do not have to be "object" buildings. Facilities such as
      Wing Headquarters, chapels, public buildings, etc., should stand out as object buildings, whereas
      other buildings should blend into the background emphasizing the object buildings. Facilities
      should foster a sense of pride among its occupants.
      8.1.2.5. (Added-ACC) Technology. Provide technically sound buildings at low costs. Take
      advantage of emerging technologies.
40                                                             AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


        8.1.2.6. (Added-ACC) Cost. Reduce life-cycle costs. Concentrate on low life-cycle costs as
        opposed to low initial costs. Our facilities should be designed, constructed, and maintained to last
        decades. Reduce labor-intensive maintenance procedures.
        8.1.2.7. (Added-ACC) Approval. Obtain user approval of design concept layout prior to prede-
        sign conferences in order to prevent costly changes during final design, contracting and construc-
        tion. This is normally done through a Customer Concept Document prior to preparation of
        programming documents.
8.2. (Added-ACC) Site Design. The land in-between and around our buildings provides the fabric
which holds our bases together. As such, these areas need to be as well thought out as our buildings.
Well-designed outdoor spaces help create friendly, inviting, walkable communities. Site selection and
design are important to achieve compatibility with the Base General Plan. The following guidelines for
site location, site issues, pavements, landscaping, site amenities, site signage and infrastructure will help
contribute to this compatibility. Include all applicable standards including force protection/anti-terrorism.
     8.2.1. (Added-ACC) Location. Situate new buildings within compatible functional groups as deter-
     mined by the base master plan.
        8.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Complexes. Locate buildings supporting common functions such as civil
        engineering, administrative, or flying functions in complexes in order to share a common infra-
        structure of roads, parking, utilities and security. These tight clusters should read as one idea with
        similar details and materials that link them aesthetically as well as functionally. Provide enough
        space around a complex for expansion. Assume 10 percent expansion whenever other supporting
        data is not available.
        8.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Environmental. Design facilities in ways to enhance environmental
        quality and minimize consumption of natural resources. Clustered buildings reduce the amount of
        land use, utility costs to run utilities to large expanses of land, and vehicle costs to move from
        building to building.
        8.2.1.3. (Added-ACC) Traffic. When existing traffic patterns are changed by new construction
        proposals, provide adequate traffic alternatives to coincide with the construction of the new
        project. Locate buildings so that you can walk between buildings in a functional group. Only
        encourage driving when walking cannot be accommodated.
        8.2.1.4. (Added-ACC) Noise. Consider noise levels and attenuation requirements when locating
        facilities. Do not locate facilities in incompatible noise zones unless no other options are available.
     8.2.2. (Added-ACC) Site. Once the site has been selected, address every aspect of site planning early
     in the process, including building siting, relationship of interior spaces to the site, pavement, land-
     scaping, pedestrian access, signage, service equipment, infrastructure, and other barriers. Design
     facilities considering both the inside functional requirements of the buildings and the influence of the
     site. Include all applicable standards including force protection/anti-terrorism.
        8.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Site influence. Do not use sites that force building function into base-
        ments, third floors, or uneconomical shapes such as curves, diagonals, or long rectangles.
        8.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Open Area. Use sites that permit open landscape space around buildings
        to separate the building from required pavement. Prevent an overcrowded appearance. Do not
        allow pavements to come directly up to facilities except for especially selected, purely industrial
        uses.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                     41


     8.2.2.3. (Added-ACC) Existing Site Contours. After positive drainage away from buildings is
     developed, use existing or natural grades and contours to avoid excessive cut and fill operations.
     8.2.2.4. (Added-ACC) Setbacks. Sites need to allow minimum setbacks from other structures
     such as buildings, roads, and parking to meet force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01
     DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards
     8.2.2.5. (Added-ACC) Environmental. Site buildings in accordance with appropriate laws and
     directives regarding wetlands, flood plains, protected species habitat, and archeological sites.
     8.2.2.6. (Added-ACC) Screening. Screen utility equipment, dumpsters, and storage areas and
     meet the requirements of UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards. Use walls and
     mature landscaping or berms. Exterior recycling bins should be treated and screened as trash
     dumpsters.
  8.2.3. (Added-ACC) Pavements. Pavements include streets, parking lots, sidewalks, and airfield
  pavement.
     8.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) Parking. Use size, location, and screening to prevent parking from
     becoming a dominant feature. Use consistent angles and stall sizes in all parking areas. Use
     drop-off areas at high-use facilities to decrease close-in parking. Use raised parking islands to
     break up parking areas. Curb all parking lots and avoid using wheel stops/bumper blocks.
     8.2.3.2. (Added-ACC) Buildings and Parking Lots. Do not locate parking directly in front of
     buildings, entrances, or between the main viewing street and buildings. Locate parking to the side
     or behind buildings. When a building is located between a street and a parking lot the building
     appearance is improved and the parking is screened with minimum cost. Consider building shape
     and relationship to other buildings to provide as much screening as possible. Ensure the principle
     or main view of the building presents a pleasing and uncluttered appearance. The parking arrange-
     ment is a major factor in providing an orderly appearance. Ensure distances between facilities and
     parking areas are in accordance with UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for
     Buildings
     8.2.3.3. (Added-ACC) Parking Lot Size. Use separate smaller parking lots of 50 cars or less
     rather than one large lot. Where large parking lots exist, landscape approximately 10 percent of the
     area within the lot.
     8.2.3.4. (Added-ACC) Walking Distance. Design parking lots to limit walking distance. Use a
     maximum of 200 feet for most buildings; for transient and unaccompanied housing, limit luggage
     carrying and walking distance to 100 feet.
     8.2.3.5. (Added-ACC) Paving. Use economical asphalt paving for most vehicle parking areas,
     but avoid asphalt sidewalks and curbs. As a minimum, use concrete for sidewalks and curbs. Con-
     sider special unit pavers for courtyards, plazas, entrances, and other high-profile sites. Provide a
     landscape buffer between all buildings and paved areas.
     8.2.3.6. (Added-ACC) Streets. Avoid utility or other cuts in pavement. Whenever possible, use
     tunneling technologies to go under pavement with conduits or piping. Streets should intersect at
     right angles and offset intersections should be avoided.
     8.2.3.7. (Added-ACC) Curbing. Curb all parking, access roads and streets (except remote/iso-
     lated). All primary streets and all parking lots should be paved with integral concrete curbs and
42                                                             AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


        gutters. Painted curbs are very difficult to maintain so they should not be used. Provide mower
        ramps for access to grass areas.
        8.2.3.8. (Added-ACC) Walkways. Use concrete walkways at least 48 inches wide to link facili-
        ties and promote pedestrian use. Illuminate walkways used heavily at night. Provide walkways on
        at least one side of every street and between all facilities. Avoid placing utility poles or signs too
        close to sidewalks.
        8.2.3.9. (Added-ACC) Handicapped Access. Ensure handicapped access is provided at inter-
        sections, crosswalks and wherever UFAS or ADA require them to be.
        8.2.3.10. (Added-ACC) Drainage. Design paved areas to minimize drainage. Drain into natural
        water courses, detention and retention ponds.
     8.2.4. (Added-ACC) Landscape. The use of appropriate trees and other landscape plantings adds
     beauty to the base, promotes energy efficiency, inhibits erosion, reduces noises, and enhances safety
     by helping to control blowing/drifting snow. Landscape planting also supports national policy aimed
     at enhancing air quality. All landscape plantings should comply with the base land management plan.
     Develop functional rather than purely visual landscapes. Plan to reduce maintenance. Provide a land-
     scaped space uncluttered by vehicles in front, at the entrance, and between the main viewing street and
     buildings.
        8.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Plant Material. Consult the Base Architectural Standards for an appro-
        priate landscaping material list. Use indigenous, low maintenance, adapted trees and shrubs
        locally recommended for urban or street use that can survive without irrigation after the first sea-
        son (one year) warranty maintenance period. Do not use plant material that drops large amounts of
        fruit or seedpods. Select deciduous trees that drop all their leaves early in the fall season rather
        than those that retain brown leaves most of the winter and continue to be a maintenance problem
        for many months. Some trees to avoid are Sycamore, Beech, and some Oaks. Place mulch bed
        around all trees and shrubs. Consider fabric barriers that contain an effective pre-emergent herbi-
        cide that will provide protection for many years.
        8.2.4.2. (Added-ACC) Sustainable Landscaping. Landscaping practices should incorporate
        sound design planning while minimizing the requirement for fertilizers and pesticides. Use water
        efficient practices such as mulches, efficient irrigation systems (drip irrigation), and reclaimed
        water. Consider using boulders with plants, gravel blankets for grass, and pebbles for ground
        cover. Soften arid landscaping with varied contours and drought-tolerant plantings.
        8.2.4.3. (Added-ACC) Preservation. Preserve existing landscape where possible. Use consoli-
        dated development areas to help preserve the existing landscape. Avoid over planting and allow
        for natural growth and form of plants. Limit turf and keep it free of obstructions which require
        trimming. Define planting areas with walkways, edging, and concrete curbs.
        8.2.4.4. (Added-ACC) Mowing Strips. Provide planting beds with wide mowing strips. Mow-
        ing strips should eliminate hand trimming and edging caused by turf creeping into bedding plants.
        8.2.4.5. (Added-ACC) Surface Runoff. Use trees, shrubs, grass, and landscaping to reduce
        storm water runoff. Terrace steep slopes.
        8.2.4.6. (Added-ACC) Berms. Use berms to screen and restrict views. Limit berm slope to one
        foot in 10 feet. Do not use earth berms against building walls.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                        43


     8.2.4.7. (Added-ACC) Function. Use landscape to reduce energy cost, shade to prevent heat and
     glare, windbreaks to lessen air infiltration. Use landscape to screen unsightly views, control pedes-
     trian circulation, define entries, and accentuate outdoor amenities.
  8.2.5. (Added-ACC) Site Components. Site components include site furniture, bicycle racks, trash
  receptacles, etc. Site components and the spaces in between buildings should be as carefully planned
  as the spaces within buildings. These spaces provide a cost-effective way to provide pleasurable
  spaces. Encourage attention to detail concerning each of these site components. Work to reduce visual
  clutter, unnecessary signs, receptacles, etc. Include all applicable standards including force protection/
  anti-terrorism.
     8.2.5.1. (Added-ACC) Site Furniture. Site furniture is defined as furniture or other accessories
     provided in outdoor areas for the comfort or convenience of personnel. Examples are benches, lit-
     ter receptacles, ash cans, picnic tables, and bicycle racks. The design of site furnishings should
     respond to the local climate and cultural influences. Bases have established an overall plan that
     complements the installation architecture and environment. Use these for site furniture selection.
     8.2.5.2. (Added-ACC) Color. Use site furnishings to complement exterior color schemes. Limit
     colorful accents to high-profile sites. Ban the use of red ash cans and yellow pipe bollards.
     8.2.5.3. (Added-ACC) Materials. Use durable materials that are appropriate for the architectural
     context and the environment, such as factory finished metals, precast concrete, or quality wood. In
     hot climates, be careful of metal finishes that may burn anyone who might touch the object.
     8.2.5.4. (Added-ACC) Outdoor Seating. Provide comfortable benches or seat walls near build-
     ing entrances and in courtyards. Tables should be limited to informal gathering places such as pic-
     nic or dining areas.
     8.2.5.5. (Added-ACC) Receptacles. Place litter receptacles and planters on paved sites where
     they are clear of circulation. All litter receptacles require attached lids. Ash receptacles must
     match outdoor furniture.
     8.2.5.6. (Added-ACC) Bollards. Bollards shall be set into paving or placed in sleeves to allow
     access. Use bollards to enhance pedestrian protection and provide vehicle control.
     8.2.5.7. (Added-ACC) Bicycle Racks. Bicycle racks should be located near entrances in secure,
     visible areas. Racks must be on concrete, brick or block pads. Use simple, attractive racks.
     8.2.5.8. (Added-ACC) Other Assorted Items. Consider accessories such as newspaper vending
     machines, smoking receptacles, planters, refuse containers, and other equipment in design plans.
     Neutralize the visual impact of these items by painting, concealment, or removal. Develop a base
     standard that defines acceptable means of accomplishment. Locate these items in convenient yet
     discrete locations.
  8.2.6. (Added-ACC) Site Signage. Site signage must provide clear, consistent, and necessary direc-
  tion or information. Correctly designed and controlled signs can be a positive aspect of the installa-
  tion's overall professional image and appearance. Signage must follow ACCI 32-1054. National
  Highway Traffic Safety Administration signs must be used for all regulatory and warning traffic signs.
     8.2.6.1. (Added-ACC) Visual Clutter. Reduce visual clutter by eliminating super-graphics,
     poorly designed signs, and outdated information. Taping temporary signs on doors, walls, or win-
     dows is prohibited. Condense and consolidate information to minimize the number of signs. Stan-
44                                                           AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


        dardize the height of all signs by type. Use sign systems that will accommodate changes. All signs
        will be in accordance with UFC 3-120-01 Air Force Sign Standard and ACCI 32-1054 Exterior
        Signs.
        8.2.6.2. (Added-ACC) Color. All exterior signs will be consistent throughout each installation.
        Langley brown (Federal spec 21000) background is the ACC standard. Poles and back of signs
        should be painted or factory finished to match.
        8.2.6.3. (Added-ACC) Street Signs. Include the Command shield on all street signs. Color and
        lettering should be consistent across the installation. Ensure there is a street name sign for each
        street at intersections.
        8.2.6.4. (Added-ACC) Directional Signs. Install directional signs only where needed to guide
        visitors and new base personnel. Normally, only four entries should be displayed on a sign.
        8.2.6.5. (Added-ACC) Special Signs. Limit unique signing to high-visibility locations where
        highlights are required to support the architectural theme. Avoid plastic letters and marquee and
        warning signs on the outside of utility or equipment room doors unless required by code.
        8.2.6.6. (Added-ACC) Parking Signs. Reduce the number of parking signs by strictly limiting
        reserved parking, including temporary reserved parking. Standardize reserved parking designa-
        tions by installation.
        8.2.6.7. (Added-ACC) Temporary Sign Standards. Develop a simple base standard for tempo-
        rary signs such as a painted brown 4"x4" column with a wood base and a brown sign with white
        lettering.
     8.2.7. (Added-ACC) Infrastructure. Components of the installation infrastructure such as street
     and area lighting and fuel and water storage tanks must be considered when developing facilities.
     Emphasis should be placed on reducing visual impact by proper siting, painting, screening, or con-
     cealment. Utilities should be underground whenever possible. Allow sufficient capacity for future
     growth. Ensure all applicable standards are followed including force protection/anti terrorism.
        8.2.7.1. (Added-ACC) Color. New equipment should have a factory-applied color appropriate to
        the installation standards. Paint existing equipment to match. Avoid galvanized or green finishes.
        8.2.7.2. (Added-ACC) Screening. Use walls and landscaping to screen all utility equipment but
        maintain required access and clear zones. Avoid the use of metal or wood fencing. See the Base
        Architectural Standards for screening materials appropriate at each base.
        8.2.7.3. (Added-ACC) Special Purpose Lights. Use lighted bollards along high-use walkways,
        inset stair and wall lights for plazas and high-use walkways.
        8.2.7.4. (Added-ACC) Street and Parking Lights. Rectangular shaped luminaries are preferred
        for high-profile locations and dark colored cobra heads for outlying sites. Comply with the Base
        Architectural Standards. Use consistent lamp types. Metal halide lamps are preferred for most
        areas, but high-pressure sodium lamps may be used where necessary. Avoid bright finishes and
        trendy mountings. Avoid use of low-pressure sodium lamps.
        8.2.7.5. (Added-ACC) Fuel and Water Storage Tanks. Avoid multiple colors, super-graphics,
        logos, and glossy finishes. Colors should be consistent with the installation Base Architectural
        Standards. Elevated storage tanks may be used to display the Command shield if appropriately
        sized and proportioned (see UFC 3-120-01 Air Force Sign Standards for requirements)
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                         45


      8.2.7.6. (Added-ACC) Security. Use quartz lights in secure areas and controlled access points
      where an instant-on feature is required.
      8.2.7.7. (Added-ACC) Fire Protection. All facilities must be designed and constructed in accor-
      dance with Mil Handbook 1008B and other ETLS available through HQ ACC/CE.
      8.2.7.8. (Added-ACC) Sewer. When siting multiple facilities, gravity flow sewers are desired
      instead of individual pumping stations at each facility.
      8.2.7.9. (Added-ACC) Efficient Use of Utilities. New facilities must be designed and con-
      structed to minimize life cycle costs or exceed energy performance standards. Active and passive
      solar will be considered in new designs. Water conservation initiatives are encouraged. Many vari-
      eties of fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lighting will produce quality lighting.
8.3. (Added-ACC) Facility Design:
   8.3.1. (Added-ACC) General. Buildings and the areas around them provide not only our places of
   work and relaxation but also reflect our sense of pride in ourselves. As such, each building and its site
   should be aesthetically attractive, convenient for its users, technically sound, compatible with its envi-
   ronment, and built with long-lasting materials and details. Refer to the installation Base Architectural
   Standards for exterior base standards. Base standards establish an architectural theme in keeping with
   the existing historical styles, local climate, and construction standards. Provide economical construc-
   tion without compromising a high quality, architecturally pleasing, and professional military appear-
   ance. Ensure all standards are followed including force protection/anti-terrorism.
   8.3.2. (Added-ACC) Exterior. Requires careful management to achieve the desired overall compat-
   ibility. Each base has to define a context and direction based on existing built and natural environ-
   ment. Ensure that the exterior details respond to the building's use, location, and importance on base.
   Use of the following guidelines will achieve the desired ACC standard.
   8.3.3. (Added-ACC) Form. Use simple plans and building forms as well as conventional sloping
   roofs. Eave heights may vary as required by interior functional relationships, but do not use more than
   one pitch angle on a building. Do not combine two kinds of roof such as flat and sloping roofs on the
   same building unless it is clearly justified by the influence of adjacent architecture, building function
   or layout. Minimize corners, offsets, and curves on horizontal and vertical surfaces. Use only as
   clearly justified by the adjacent architecture, building function, or layout.
      8.3.3.1. (Added-ACC) New versus Old. Imitate and improve on existing base building forms to
      provide harmony between new and old. When new sloping roofed buildings are sited among exist-
      ing flat profiled buildings, steps must be taken to develop some secondary flat forms to relate the
      new to the old.
      8.3.3.2. (Added-ACC) Height. Except for dormitories, which are limited to three stories, limit
      buildings to two stories above ground. Do not use basements.
      8.3.3.3. (Added-ACC) Main Entrance. Emphasize the main entrance of all facilities, .
      8.3.3.4. (Added-ACC) Mechanical. Do not let mechanical systems become form-givers. Locate
      mechanical units to the rear or side of buildings. Design these features to blend in and to integrate
      with the building architecture in such a way that they are not prominent or detectable. Match mate-
      rials for mechanical enclosures to the building they serve; i.e., masonry with masonry. Use of
      roof-mounted equipment requires a waiver from HQ ACC/CE. If required, match the equipment
46                                                            AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


        enclosure to the roof or wall material, as much as possible. Equipment wells are also acceptable.
        As a minimum, screen any equipment at ground level with landscape. In arid climates architec-
        tural screens are required. When screening mechanical equipment, ensure adequate clearance as
        recommended by the equipment manufacturer is provided to allow for proper air circulation.
     8.3.4. (Added-ACC) Walls. Minimize use of curves, cants, or angles other than 90-degree corners.
     Use only as clearly justified by the adjacent architecture, building function or layout.
        8.3.4.1. (Added-ACC) Material. On exterior walls, use low maintenance, durable materials that
        are integrally colored and textured such as brick, split-face Concrete Masonry Units (CMU), split
        ribbed CMU, prominently exposed aggregate on precast concrete or other substrates, and inte-
        grally colored concrete that is textured by use of form liners. Brushed, honed, or sandblasted con-
        crete is not acceptable. Avoid materials that require painting. Use of bricks, blocks, or grout
        containing fly ash or other byproducts is encouraged. Use concrete containing fly ash or other
        recycled materials. Autoclaved cellular cement should be used where appropriate. On interior
        walls, the use of exposed or painted CMU is not allowed except in gymnasiums or industrial uses.
        8.3.4.2. (Added-ACC) Metal. Metal walls are only acceptable for extremely large buildings
        such as aircraft hangars and temporary buildings. See the metal building section of this document.
        8.3.4.3. (Added-ACC) Doors and Windows. Use energy-efficient doors, windows, and door/
        window frames. Consider if doors or windows from previous facility modifications can be reused/
        recycled. Use of doors, windows and door/window framing containing recycled materials is
        encouraged.
        8.3.4.4. (Added-ACC) Painting. Do not paint new buildings and do not use materials that are
        typically restored by painting such as stucco, metal fascia, and various kinds of siding. Do not
        paint CMU. Secondary doors may be painted as described in the next paragraph. On metal build-
        ings, select a factory prefinished material. See the Base Architectural Standards for this selection.
        8.3.4.5. (Added-ACC) Anodized Aluminum. Color anodized aluminum in neutral colors is rec-
        ommended for exterior metals normally associated with walls such as fascia, gutters, downspouts,
        windows, and building entrances. Fire exit doors and other secondary doors and frames may be
        painted for economy. When painting secondary doors and fire exits, they should be painted to
        match the primary color anodized entrances or painted to match adjacent walls; this is a designer
        option. The objective is to produce a simple appearance which is uncluttered by many colored
        shapes.
     8.3.5. (Added-ACC) Doors and Windows. Aluminum anodized, factory finished door and window
     frames are preferred for most locations. Avoid use of mirrored glazing. Operable windows and tinted,
     energy-efficient glazing are encouraged. Where appropriate, install window screens to take advantage
     of natural ventilation. Provide window screens where windows are operable and designed for ventila-
     tion. Windows that operate primarily to allow cleaning do not need screens. Provide screens for Unac-
     companied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH).
     8.3.6. (Added-ACC) Roofs. Use sloped roofs greater than 3:12 on ACC buildings. Use proven
     cost-effective roof systems with high durability and weather resistance such as factory-finished stand-
     ing-seam metal or shingle roof. These low-maintenance alternatives are required because of the poor
     maintenance history of flat multi-ply built-up roofs. Generally use a hip or gabled roof. Do not com-
     bine roofing materials such as metal and shingles on one roof. Make all of the building parts compat-
     ible with each other. Overhangs for weather protection and shade are desirable. Avoid roof- top
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                      47


  mechanical equipment. Where unavoidable make sure rooftop units are screened. Use of roof- top
  mechanical units requires a waiver from HQ ACC/CE. Roofing made from recycled materials is rec-
  ommended.
     8.3.6.1. (Added-ACC) Alternatives. Do not use low slope roofing if 3:12 or steeper pitch is fea-
     sible. Building form and size (extremely large buildings such as supply facilities or commissaries)
     may occasionally require lower slopes and other materials. Slopes as low as 1:12 are generally
     accepted for metal (consult with manufacturers for particulars). When a multi-ply built-up roof is
     used, slope the roof at 1/4:12 minimum. The slope is to be accomplished with structural members
     for new built-up roofs, not by tapering the insulation. Roofs with slopes under 3:12 require a
     waiver from HQ ACC/CE.
     8.3.6.2. (Added-ACC) Drainage. Provide continuous roof slope to the perimeter of the building.
     Do not design interior valleys or depressions that will form ponds if a roof drain becomes
     obstructed. Ensure overflow scuppers are provided in accordance with applicable codes for para-
     pets.
     8.3.6.3. (Added-ACC) Skylights and Clerestories. These features may be used where strong
     functional and economic justification dictates; fully document economic justification and submit
     with proposed design to include life-cycle cost of special ballast and control devices. Be sure to
     consider heat load and occupant comfort as part of the proposed design. General area lighting for
     warehouses is not considered strong enough functional justification to compensate for the gener-
     ally high maintenance associated with large numbers of skylights on a flat roof.
     8.3.6.4. (Added-ACC) Metal Fascia. Do not use wide metal fascias with flat roofed buildings. If
     a band is desired around the top of a building, provide it with masonry detailing such as projec-
     tions, soldier course, or stack bond. Masonry detailing provides a more durable maintenance free
     fascia that does not require painting.
  8.3.7. (Added-ACC) Additions. When building additions are proposed, careful coordination is
  required to determine if the addition should match the old building or if the old building should be
  changed and brought up to ACC standards at the same time as the addition.
     8.3.7.1. (Added-ACC) Small Additions. When additions are less than 25% of the existing build-
     ing's floor area, design additions to match the original construction.
     8.3.7.2. (Added-ACC) Large Additions. When additions exceed 40% of the original building
     area, the addition and the original construction are required to comply with ACC standards. For
     example, a flat-roofed building of 10,000 square feet needs an addition of 5,000 square feet. In this
     example 5,000 is more than 40%. Therefore the addition shall have a sloped roof per this instruc-
     tion, and the roof of the original building shall be replaced with a sloped roof.
     8.3.7.3. (Added-ACC) Compatibility. In either case (large or small), when additions are com-
     plete, they should be architecturally compatible rather than obvious add-ons.
     8.3.7.4. (Added-ACC) Fire Sprinklers. Designers of additions need to evaluate the need for
     sprinkler protection for both the new and existing structures IAW Mil Handbook 1008B and NFPA
     101
  8.3.8. (Added-ACC) Metal Buildings. Metal buildings may be used for only large structures such as
  hangars or temporary facilities. Large buildings are still required to have a masonry base proportion-
  ate to the height of the building. Temporary buildings must be removed within 1 year. All temporary
48                                                             AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


     buildings and large buildings except hangars require a waiver from HQ ACC/CE. Specialized facili-
     ties such as water towers and fuel tanks may be metal.
        8.3.8.1. (Added-ACC) Location. Use metal buildings where they are compatible with adjacent
        structures. Do not use metal buildings in highly visible locations unless other metal buildings sur-
        round them. Metal buildings used anywhere should be well screened with walls or vegetation.
        Large structures require a masonry base proportional to the height of the building. When design-
        ing a new metal building, consider using a textured, integrally colored masonry base for durability.
        8.3.8.2. (Added-ACC) Finish. Use factory applied finishes with more than 15-year warranties.
        8.3.8.3. (Added-ACC) Submit Site Justification. At the programming stage, submit siting cri-
        teria and waiver request to HQ ACC/CE. Indicate adjacent building construction. If the building is
        isolated, describe how visible it is from major, minor, or service roads. State reason for selection
        of metal over masonry in addition to cost consideration.
        8.3.8.4. (Added-ACC) Protective Masonry. Provide protection on the exterior of buildings
        where impact to metal panels is probable. For example, integrally colored and textured masonry
        should be used at entrances, at corners, exterior wainscot to four feet high where vehicles are
        parked next to buildings, around forklift operations, and at loading docks.
     8.3.9. (Added-ACC) Colors. Each installation is required to have an exterior color standard. The
     Command standard is to use neutral colors such as grey, tan or beige or colors that occur naturally in
     traditional building materials as the field colors with complementary trim colors which are compatible
     with regional color motifs. Use neutral anodized colors such as brown tone or gray tone neutral. Judg-
     ment has to be exercised in selection of colors for isolated miscellaneous features such as exit doors,
     downspouts, etc. In some cases, a building benefits from having isolated features colored to match
     adjacent light-colored walls. This is very important on older buildings with many windows and doors.
     Coloring trim a contrasting color can produce a cluttered appearance.
        8.3.9.1. (Added-ACC) Wall Materials. Select neutral colors such as beiges and browns.
        8.3.9.2. (Added-ACC) Exterior Metals. Use neutral anodized colors such as bronze. When alu-
        minum, hollow metal, and wood are mixed on one building, hollow metal and wood may be
        painted to match the aluminum color or adjacent walls. In any case, do not use a third color that
        does not match the bronze metals. Use one trim color to the greatest extent possible.
        8.3.9.3. (Added-ACC) New Work. Do not paint new masonry.
        8.3.9.4. (Added-ACC) Color Use. Usually two colors on a building produce the best appear-
        ance--one wall color and one trim color. Do not use more than three colors--one wall color and two
        trim or accent colors such as exposed aggregate fascia, columns, beams, etc.
     8.3.10. (Added-ACC) Utility and Dumpster Enclosures. Provide an enclosed yard to conceal mis-
     cellaneous support items such as generators, transformers, trash, lawn equipment, flammable storage,
     HVAC, meters, and aboveground tanks.
        8.3.10.1. (Added-ACC) Enclosures. Match enclosing walls to the building wall material. Split
        faced CMU is a good durable material. When this is not possible, metal slats and planting may be
        used. In some cases, plant material by itself may be used to conceal the service area, but it must
        functionally conceal the service area at the time of planting. All enclosures need to be at least 6
        feet tall. If the items being concealed are taller than 6 feet, then the enclosure should be as tall as
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                       49


     the tallest item in the enclosures plus 6 inches. The use of open panel block is permitted when
     enclosing electrical substations, transformers, or switches for proper heat dissipation.
     8.3.10.2. (Added-ACC) Gates. Provide gates for trash enclosures or where accessibility or ser-
     viceability is an issue of concern/function.
     8.3.10.3. (Added-ACC) Subdivide. Organize and layout the service yards by responsibility. For
     instance, HVAC equipment should not be in the trash enclosure. Many of the functions may
     require separation and separate access such as tools, lawn mowers, fuel, etc.
     8.3.10.4. (Added-ACC) Pavement. Provide vehicular access and surfacing such as pavement,
     grass pavers, or gravel to reduce maintenance. Use concrete curbs or edging.
     8.3.10.5. (Added-ACC) Service Areas. Integrate service areas with the building design and
     match adjacent materials.
  8.3.11. (Added-ACC) K-SPAN. K-SPAN use and application are more suited to forward operating
  locations of CENTCOM and SOUTHCOM, or during contingency operations. In all cases, K-SPAN
  facilities to be located on ACC bases require HQ ACC/CE siting approval prior to purchase, delivery,
  or start of work. Treat inflatable buildings the same.
     8.3.11.1. (Added-ACC) Use. Limit K-SPAN to storage applications outside the main area of
     ACC bases such as weapon storage areas.
     8.3.11.2. (Added-ACC) Structural. Provide additional reinforcing and structural analysis when
     either design wind load or design live load exceeds allowable values for a K-SPAN structure of
     given width and height. Consider K-SPAN structures with a factory finished metal.
     8.3.11.3. (Added-ACC) Site Justification. Submit site justification with programming docu-
     ments. Provide enough information about the intended site to satisfy HQ ACC/CE that the
     K-SPAN buildings will be compatible with their surroundings. Indicate what is in the site vicinity
     and if the buildings are visible from roads or populated areas.
  8.3.12. (Added-ACC) Solar Application. Integrate solar components with roof or wall forms. Give
  preference to passive solar applications over active solar applications. Do not let solar components
  clutter or break the normal building form line. EXAMPLE: Vertical collectors should look like glass
  walls and roof collectors should match the roof slope. EXCEPTIONS: When collectors do not look
  like walls or match roof slopes, screen them from view with materials that coordinate with the build-
  ing material.
  8.3.13. (Added-ACC) Facility Signs. Provide signs that comply with base architectural compatibil-
  ity. Comply with sign standards provided in ACCI 32-1054. Limit signs to function identification and
  street address, and ensure they are easily readable from the street. Avoid miscellaneous emblems,
  logos, and direct-paint applications. Standardize building address sign size and placement on each
  installation. One unit identification sign is permitted for each facility.
     8.3.13.1. (Added-ACC) Moving Signs. Do not use moving or revolving signs.
     8.3.13.2. (Added-ACC) Monument. Use of pole-mounted or AAFES concession monument
     signs is a local base decision that has to consider suitability in terms of base architectural compat-
     ibility issues. Base personnel should decide this issue.

        8.3.13.3. (Added-ACC) Lettering Size. For signs other than those covered by ACCI 32-1054,
        size lettering according to the functional viewing distance. Keep sign sizes to a minimum. The rule
        to follow for readability is one inch of letter height for each 25 feet of view distance. EXAMPLE:
        If a sign is intended to be read from a passing car using a road 100 feet away, the largest sign let-
        tering would be 4 inches (100 divided by 25 equal 4). Do not oversize.
        8.3.13.4. (Added-ACC) AAFES/DeCA/Commercial Signs. Logo and lettering supplied by
        AAFES/DeCA/or the parent organization are required to be light to dark bronze. It must also be in
        compliance with the standards that follow.
           8.3.13.4.1. (Added-ACC) Format shall be AAFES logo followed by facility name; i.e.,
           AAFES BASE EXCHANGE. This format shall be used for all AAFES facilities including
           shoppettes, laundry and dry cleaners, military clothing sales, and class six stores.
           8.3.13.4.2. (Added-ACC) Logo and facility name shall be the same height and positioned on
           one continuous horizontal line wherever possible.
           8.3.13.4.3. (Added-ACC) Facility name shall be spelled out completely with individual let-
           ters.
           8.3.13.4.4. (Added-ACC) Logo and letters shall be mounted directly to the building fascia or
           exterior wall adjacent to the facility's main entrance. The back edge of logo and letters shall be
           1/4 inch from the face of the wall or fascia.
           8.3.13.4.5. (Added-ACC) Logo and letters shall be light or dark bronze anodized aluminum
           or other noncorrosive material in a light or dark bronze color. Select finish color for maximum
           contrast and readability.
           8.3.13.4.6. (Added-ACC) Logo and letters shall be available in even height increments from
           2 to 16 inches. Choose the appropriate size and color for each facility and location.
           8.3.13.4.7. (Added-ACC) The ratio of height to depth of logo and letters shall be approxi-
           mately 8 to 1.
        8.3.13.5. (Added-ACC) Lighted Signs. Internally lighted signs create a commercial impression
        that is not compatible with ACC goals. When night visibility is functionally required, use external
        flood or spot lights that illuminate both the sign and adjacent landscape or building. Illumination
        of the sign with its surroundings makes a better impression and improves orientation.
        8.3.13.6. (Added-ACC) Lettering. All lettering on all base signs should be of the same style.
        Uppercase Helvetica medium type style is recommended.
     8.3.14. (Added-ACC) Exterior Graphics, Striping and Banding:
        8.3.14.1. (Added-ACC) Super Graphics. Painted stripes and letters may be used to rehabilitate
        large, plain, existing buildings. Design graphics to function: define entrances, identify building
        numbers, and conceal clutter. Proportion graphics to the building size. Do not exceed 3 feet in
        height of letters or banding for the largest buildings.
        8.3.14.2. (Added-ACC) Use. Use graphics to relate buildings to each other instead of making a
        building prominent.
        8.3.14.3. (Added-ACC) Limits. Graphics are not required on every building. Too much graphic
        work reduces a building to a billboard. Except for painted masonry and metal buildings, identifi-
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                         51


     cation signage should be located in adjacent landscaped space at eye level rather than being
     attached to walls or fascia. This will provide a better impression of the total base. A building's
     order of importance should be established by factors such as quality of architecture and landscape,
     not size and location of signage.
     8.3.14.4. (Added-ACC) New Buildings. Do not use high-color contrasting bands and stripes on
     new buildings. Use masonry detailing, or texture changes to provide interest. This does not apply
     to exposed aggregate panels when used as a fascia.
     8.3.14.5. (Added-ACC) Structural Elements. Do not paint structural columns and beams. This
     approach generally creates clutter. Instead, design a banding scheme that relates the building to
     other buildings on the base.
  8.3.15. (Added-ACC) Force Protection/Anti-Terrorism (UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiter-
  rorism Standards for Buildings). Coordinate and integrate force protection/anti-terrorism elements
  such as walls, blast protection and fences with base and building architecture as well as good architec-
  tural practices. For instance, during site planning cluster buildings that are functionally compatible
  with strong boundaries and move parking away from the cluster. Use distance in a positive way. Dur-
  ing facility site design, use landscaping, bollards, planters, and other site amenities as barriers. Pro-
  vide adequate lighting. Place utilities underground. In facility design, elevate the first floor, construct
  blast protection by surfacing it with the same materials as the building that it is protecting, and mini-
  mize signage. Good force protection/anti-terrorism planning and design is compatible with good plan-
  ning and architectural practices.

                                          Chapter 9 (Added-ACC)

                                ACC INTERIOR DESIGN STANDARDS

9.1. (Added-ACC) Interior Design Policy:
     9.1.1. (Added-ACC) These standards have been developed to provide for the best possible coordina-
     tion of interior finishes and furnishings for long-lasting maintainable interiors.
     9.1.2. (Added-ACC) These standards are developed around an understanding of the elements and
     principles of design and of how the industry operates, not around personal likes and dislikes.
     9.1.3. (Added-ACC) Each year the Color Association of the United States (CAUS) develops a color
     palette for the succeeding year. This palette changes gradually each year and is the guide by which
     manufacturers determine the colorways in which they will produce their products. Whether it be fash-
     ion or automobiles, refrigerators or ceramic tile, these color palettes influence manufacturers. The
     images of the pink and black tile bathrooms of the 50s, the avocado green or harvest gold kitchen
     appliances and laminate countertops of the late 60s and early 70s, and the mauve and teal color
     schemes of the 80s is why it is a mistake to use faddish colors in permanent finishes. All in-vogue or
     trendy colors become dated once wallcovering, carpet or other manufacturers change their color pal-
     ette.
     9.1.4. (Added-ACC) The Air Combat Command standards ensure materials purchased and installed
     in our facilities will perform well in respect to both aesthetics and durability.
9.2. (Added-ACC) Command Standards. Air Combat Command standards vary based on whether a
finish is permanent or non-permanent. The differentiation is necessary due to annual CAUS color palette
changes. Generally permanent finishes last longer and consequently need to be a color that will not
become dated after a few years. Non-permanent finishes do not last as long and can be updated as palettes
change.
9.3. (Added-ACC) Permanent Finishes:
     9.3.1. (Added-ACC) Permanent finishes are generally the hard surface structural interior design
     (SID) finishes that will last 15 to 20 years and whose removal and re-installation can be costly and
     may cause a major disruption to the facility. Such items as vinyl composition tile (VCT), ceramic, and
     other hard surface tiles, plastic laminates, toilet partitions, lockers, window blinds, all modular or sys-
     tems furniture panels, work surfaces, flipper doors, etc., are considered permanent finishes.
     9.3.2. (Added-ACC) Command standards require that all permanent finishes be in either brown-tone
     or grey-tone neutrals. These neutral shades can be from very light (such as off-white) to a mid-range
     neutral of the same shade (taupe). Neutrals with obvious pink, yellow, or blue undertones should be
     avoided.
9.4. (Added-ACC) Non-permanent Finishes:
     9.4.1. (Added-ACC) Carpet, paint, vinyl wallcovering, upholstery, artwork, etc. are considered
     non-permanent finishes. Non-permanent finishes will last from 5 to 7 years under most conditions.
     9.4.2. (Added-ACC) Command standards allow non-permanent finishes to be any coloration appro-
     priate to the facility. Most often these finishes will be in mid-range colorations. Very seldom would
     there be a use for pastel or very bright colors in ACC facilities.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                        53


   9.4.3. (Added-ACC) While non-permanent finishes are permitted in various colors, it is highly rec-
   ommended that in office and other work areas, vinyl wallcovering or painted wall surfaces be kept in
   a neutral coloration. Light reflective surfaces are important to a productive work environment.
   Develop a neutral shell for the interior space of work areas, allowing the carpet, upholstery, artwork
   and accessories to provide the color accents. Since many facilities frequently change occupants or
   even function, this neutral shell provides a solid base for future flexibility.
9.5. (Added-ACC) Finishes and Treatments:
   9.5.1. (Added-ACC) Carpet. (See ETL 99-06: Air Force Carpet Standard and the ACC Carpet
   Guidance). In most facilities a bold tweed or patterned nylon commercial grade loop pile carpet is
   appropriate. Bold tweed means yarns of several different colors, not various shades of the same color.
   This allows for several upholstery color combinations within a facility. The majority of yarns must be
   in mid-range to dark tones to increase the carpet's soil hiding capabilities. In most cases, a dense loop
   pile is the most hardwearing type of carpet. The face weight should be a minimum of 26 oz/sy.
   Equally important is the density of a carpet product. Density is a key factor in soiling and resiliency.
   In an adequately dense pile, dirt will remain on the surface so that it is easily vacuumed away. In addi-
   tion, more compact fibers are less likely to crush since tufts tend to support each other in the upright
   position. ACC recommends a minimum density factor of 5,000 for commercial carpets. Refer to ETL
   00-06, Table 1 to calculate minimum pile weight to density ratios. Solution-dyed carpets are recom-
   mended for medical facilities, Child Development Centers, lodging facilities and Youth Centers. Ole-
   fin and polyester (PET) carpet fibers do not meet heavy or severe wear classifications required for the
   majority of ACC facilities. Polyester carpet is currently manufactured only in cut pile products and its
   crush resistance is poor. Olefin and polyester carpeting has limited use in light or moderate wear
   applications possibly including military family housing.
      9.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Carpet Tile/6' Vinyl Backed. Use of carpet tile is strongly recom-
      mended in office areas with systems or modular furniture. Installation techniques are available
      which allow carpet tile removal and installation without disassembling systems furniture arrange-
      ment. Carpet tile or its associated 6-foot wide rolled goods should also be used in corridors. Tile or
      6-foot vinyl-backed products must be installed with manufacturer's recommended releasable
      adhesive. Extra tiles or yardage from the same dye lot may be ordered to replace tiles or patch as
      necessary. Bold tweed patterns or textures help to hide seaming.
      9.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) Solid Carpet/Border. Use of solid-colored carpet is approved only for
      Distinguished Visitors quarters in lodging facilities. Carpet borders may be solid in color. They
      may be installed with either carpet tile or roll goods. Do not over-do borders within a facility.
   9.5.2. (Added-ACC) Hard Surface Flooring. Hard surface or resilient flooring should be used
   mainly in heavy abuse areas, wet rooms or walk-off areas to provide superior wearability and
   cleanability, for exceptions see the Housing Guide and the Unaccompanied Personnel Housing Guide.
      9.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Ceramic Tile, Porcelain Tile, Natural Stone and Cast Stone Flooring.
      A mottled, flecked, or speckled floor tile should be used. Use a medium to dark toned grout that
      coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled appearance. Tile banding accents or pat-
      terns are allowed on walls and floors, provided the accent is another neutral shade that coordinates
      with the dominate tile color. Install with a coordinating base of the same material.
      9.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) VCT, Sheet Vinyl, Laminate Flooring, Stratica ®, etc. A m o t t l e d ,
      flecked, speckled, wood or stone pattern should be used. Avoid very light tones. Install with a
54                                                              AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


        coordinating vinyl or rubber base. Laminate flooring is not recommended for commercial applica-
        tions.
     9.5.3. (Added-ACC) Vinyl or Rubber Base and Carpet Base. Vinyl or rubber base color should
     coordinate with the floor or wall surface. Do not use an accent color for the base. A no-toe profile base
     should be used with carpet tile installations. A 4-inch carpet base surged with a coordinating thread or
     capped with a coordinating neutral vinyl or rubber carpet cap can be used in carpeted areas. If carpet
     base is to be used in place of a vinyl or rubber cove base, it should be the same product that meets the
     wall whether field or border carpet.
     9.5.4. (Added-ACC) Vinyl Wallcovering. Type II wallcovering is recommended in most applica-
     tions for its superior durability and inherent ability to hide wall imperfections. Type I has very limited
     use in most ACC facilities. A vertical texture or pattern will help hide seaming and a heavy overall
     texture will hide nail holes or other damage that may occur during the life of the product. Napped
     material or wall carpet cannot be used as an interior finish.
     9.5.5. (Added-ACC) Paint. Use a low-sheen, latex enamel for all painted surfaces. Flat paint is dif-
     ficult to maintain. Use a semi-gloss finish for trim paint.
     9.5.6. (Added-ACC) Wainscot and Chair Rail. Wainscot is not recommended in most areas. Dark
     paneled wainscot has the effect of visually reducing the size of small office spaces, while in hallways
     it has a railroading effect. A Type II heavy duty vinyl wallcovering installed floor to ceiling will have
     a better effect. The purpose of chair rail is to protect wall surfaces from being marred by chair backs.
     Therefore, the chair back height must be considered to properly locate the chair rail. It may be stained
     or painted to coordinate with the other woodwork or doors. Wainscot and chair rail should be no more
     than 36" high in rooms and no more than 42" high in corridors. Heavy vinyl bumper guards may also
     be used to protect walls in corridors where needed. These should be in neutral tones to coordinate with
     the walls.
     9.5.7. (Added-ACC) Laminates and Solid Surfacing. Laminate surfaces are more easily main-
     tained if they have a flecked, speckled, mottled, textured or stone look in a matte finish. Soiling and
     water spotting is nearly invisible on this type of surface. Solid surfacing material (Corian ®, Avonite
     ®, etc.) has an extended life cycle and superior reparability, but is a costly alternative to plastic lami-
     nate and should be considered with caution.
     9.5.8. (Added-ACC) Doors and Door Frames. Depending on the quality of the doors, they may be
     either stained or painted. If painted, select a color to blend or coordinate with the walls. Paint should
     be a semi-gloss finish. It is not recommended to paint doors and jambs in accent colors as this frag-
     ments the space. Use artwork, upholsteries, etc. for color.
     9.5.9. (Added-ACC) Window Blinds. Vertical blinds or metal horizontal blinds should be in
     off-white or light neutrals. Dark blinds that match the anodized finish of the window frames are
     acceptable, provided the windows are of reflective glass to prevent heat build-up.
     9.5.10. (Added-ACC) Ceilings. In almost all facilities, ceilings (whether painted or ceiling tile), are
     to be white or off-white. Textured ceiling tiles in 2-foot squares with a tegular edge are recommended.
     9.5.11. (Added-ACC) Systems/Pre-wired Workstations/Modular Furniture. All panel fabrics,
     work surfaces, flipper doors, etc., are to be in either brown-tone or gray-tone neutrals. Removable tack
     boards can be purchased in a colored or patterned accent fabric. Only one type of systems furniture
     should be used per building in order to allow greater flexibility in reconfiguration as occupants' needs
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                        55


  change and to provide continuity throughout the space. In open office areas with systems furniture,
  carpet tile is recommended. Installation techniques are available which allow carpet tile removal and
  installation without disassembling systems furniture arrangement.
  9.5.12. (Added-ACC) Interior Signage. Interior signage should coordinate with the facility color
  scheme. Neutral colors or brushed metals are preferred in most buildings. Select a style with
  user-friendly changeable inserts to increase flexibility and life span. Text should be a contrasting color
  from the background. Type style and size should be easily legible. Ensure that all new signage is ADA
  compliant. Signage should provide for ease of traffic flow throughout the facility, and clearly delin-
  eate office locations.

                                  MAINTENANCE INSTALLATION

10.1. (Added-ACC) Maintenance and Installation:
     10.1.1. (Added-ACC) Always install products according to manufacturer's specifications. Use qual-
     ified and reputable installers. Warranties will not be valid unless these are done.
     10.1.2. (Added-ACC) Any finish or furnishing product is only as good as the maintenance it
     receives. A regular maintenance program is crucial to the longevity of any material used in a facility.
     In most cases, cleaning and maintenance must conform to manufacturer's instructions to validate war-
     ranties.

11.1. (Added-ACC) Affirmative Procurement Policy:
   11.1.1. (Added-ACC) The ACC Affirmative Procurement Policy encourages the purchase/use of
   items containing recycled materials if the price and availability are reasonable, the item meets reason-
   able performance specifications, and it would not result in inadequate competition. Use of insulation
   and cement/concrete containing fly ash is required.

Terms
Budget Authorization Account Number (BAAN)—Assigned by HQ USAF for budgetary, accounting
and control purposes, to identify military construction projects at a specified Air Force base or for a
special program; for example, 843 FAC where 84 specifies the authorization year, 3 the funding year, FA
the base, and C the specific project.
Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) Services—Includes structure-related finishes and items which
62                                                              AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005


are a standard design requirement, as well as selection of furnishings and preparation of furniture
placement plans, furnishings specifications, and estimates.
Construction Agent (CA)—The Department of Defense component responsible for the technical
execution of project construction. For Air Force Military Construction Projects, this is normally the
Army Corps of Engineers or Naval Facilities Engineering Command. Normally, the Base Civil Engineer
is the construction agent for base-level construction contracts procured through an Air Force contracting
office.
Construction Manager (CM)—The Air Force organization designated to manage construction, provide
Air Force interface with the Construction Agent, and provide updates on construction milestones to the
Air Staff and major commands for specific projects.
Contracting Officer—A designated government official authorized to enter into, administer, and
terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.
Cost Growth—The difference between the current construction contract amount and the construction
contract award amount. The estimated cost of outstanding claims will be included in the current contract
amount. Contract modifications which may be excluded are:
     •   Modifications issued under a "variations in estimated quantities" clause in the contract, or
     •   Planned modifications when a contract is awarded, providing they are within the scope of the
         project and could not have been included in the original contract because criteria was not avail-
         able, or other similar circumstances.
Design Agent—The Department of Defense component responsible for technical execution of project
design. For Air Force Military Construction Projects, this is normally the Army Corps of Engineers or
Naval Facilities Engineering Command. Normally, the Base Civil Engineer is the design agent for
base-level design contracts procured through an Air Force contracting office.
Design Deficiency—Consists of either design errors or omissions. Examples of design deficiencies for
which potential A-E liability should be evaluated:
     •   Conflicts between the plans and specifications, among the plans, or among the specifications.
     •   Designs which result in inadequate structures or systems to support necessary loads, carry neces-
         sary fluids or power, or provide sufficient heating or cooling, or are in any way insufficient to per-
         form their intended functions.
     •   Omission of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, or other component necessary for the
         safe, efficient, and proper functioning of the designed item.
     •   Omission of specifications or plans necessary to properly instruct construction contractors during
         their contract performance.
Design Manager (DM)—The Air Force organization designated to manage the design, provide Air Force
interface with the design agent, and provide updates on design milestones to the Air Staff and major
commands for specific projects.
Financial Completion (FC) Date—The date the disbursing agent pays (expenses) the final projects bills.
Health Facilities Office (HFO)—Field representative of the Surgeon General during design and
construction of medical facilities.
AFI32-1023_ACCSUP1_I 23 JUNE 2005                                                                      63


Host Major Command—The organization with real estate responsibility for the installation on which a
project constructed.
Inspection—The construction agent's review of all phases of the construction work to ascertain quality or
state of work and to determine compliance with plans and specifications and contract provisions. This
includes, but is not limited to, such items as checking layout of the construction in the field and safety
compliance; inspecting workmanship and materials to determine conformity with contract documents;
reviewing laboratory tests and analyses of materials; completing and submitting field and progress
reports; and checking monthly and final estimates as a basis for contractor payment.
Lost Design—That portion of design cost for work which is deleted or redesigned at additional cost.
Scope not awarded (such as additive bid items) and changes in criteria, siting, and requirements usually
result in lost design. Lost design is not reported if the project is canceled and reported as breakage.
Management Reserve Account—Contingency funds used to support modifications in a construction
contract resulting from user changes or other changes directed by the construction manager.
Military Construction Program (MILCON)—The program approved annually by the Congress in the
Military Construction Appropriation Act.
Physical Completion (PC) Date—The date the project is physically complete and all deficiencies listed
on the reverse side of DD Form 1354 have been corrected.
