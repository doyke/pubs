                                  GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Section 1A—Purpose, Scope & Description of this Handbook

1.1. Purpose, Scope & Description of this Handbook.
   1.1.1. Purpose. AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S),
   prescribes standardized processes for all materiel management activities operated or
   supported by the Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S). It applies to all ILS-S users.
   1.1.2. Description of Parts. This volume is divided into the following parts:
      1.1.2.1. AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 1, ILS-S, Materiel Management Operations
      provides system interface guidance related to the execution of materiel management
      processes outlined in AFMAN 23-122.
      1.1.2.2. AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 2, ILS-S, Standard Base Supply System Operations
      specifies the functional and technical processes applicable to status inquiries, notices,
      record maintenance and associated information within the Standard Base Supply System
      (SBSS).
      1.1.2.3. AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 3, ILS-S, Standard Base Supply System Reference
      specifies the functional and technical processes applicable to system operations within
      the SBSS.
      1.1.2.4. AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 4, ILS-S, Ancillary Components addresses the Air
      Force Supply Central Database (AFSCDB) and the Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S).
      The AFSCDB is designed to replicate the SBSS processes without changing its business
      practices. This part of the handbook provides detailed information on the AFSCDB.
      Additionally, an introduction to the ES-S and link to the online ES-S handbook is
      provided.
   1.1.3. Relation to other Publications. If the information in this handbook appears to
   conflict with between the various volumes, parts, or chapters of this handbook, the conflicts
   will be referred to the publication OPR for resolution.
   1.1.4. Changes to this publication. Command staff offices or AF bases desiring to make
   recommended changes to the information contained herein will make such recommendations
   through their respective MAJCOM/command chain. Supplements to this publication are
   allowed at MAJCOM level or higher and must be routed to the OPR of this publication for
   coordination prior to certification and approval.
   1.1.5. Construct. This manual has the same construct as AFI 23-101 and AFMAN 23-122.
   While not all sections within AFI 23-101 have associated procedures enumerated in AFMAN
   23-122 or this publication, those sections where procedures/processes are detailed have the
   same section titles. For example, Sec. 5D, Equipment Management is the same section in
   AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122, and Ch 5.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   23


       1.1.5.1. Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 for reference
       information as well as identification of legacy AF supply chain functions with updated
       terminology.
       1.1.5.2. The Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) system is the overarching term
       used to describe the system(s) used by base retail materiel management operations. The
       ILS-S is comprised of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Enterprise Solution –
       Supply (ES-S), and the Air Force Supply Centralized Database (AFSCDB). In many
       cases the term ILS-S is used to identify system related functions/references. Where
       applicable, in some instances, specific identification of SBSS or ES-S is used for more
       detailed identification.

      1.3.3.2. Part 1 - 120-25 Day Conversion Procedures. The conversion upload package is
      processed as a separate entity, and no other transactions are input. Any rejects resulting
      from input during this period should be corrected and processed before the next
      scheduled period. The establishment of a host or satellite account consists of multiple
      steps which must be followed in the sequence provided in this section.
          1.3.3.2.1. Load the applicable Information Technology (IT) system software using
          the normal Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) procedures. The DECC notifies the
          Remote Processing Station (RPS) operator when the software is loaded.
          1.3.3.2.2. Process all normal end-of-day reports. Process R03 for normal distribution.
          For non-autonomous satellite transfers, process those A&F reports prescribed by
          DFAS-DE 7077.10-M. For other transfers, process all End of Month (EOM) reports
          and those A&F reports prescribed by DFAS-DE 7077.10-M. Note: If it is determined
          that resizing is necessary, follow all instructions Para. 1.3.4 below. If it is determined
          that resizing is not necessary, proceed to Para 1.3.3.2.6.
          1.3.3.2.3. Run NGV027, Fail Safe.
              1.3.3.2.3.1. Correct all errors before continuing.
              1.3.3.2.3.2. Label the list BEFORE CONVERSION.
          1.3.3.2.4. Process an IRUDUMP to dump Data Base Area to Tape Label the file
          dump PRIOR TO REHOME/ADD NEW ACCOUNT. Note: If it is determined that
          resizing is necessary, follow all instructions Para 1.3.4 below. If it is determined that
          resizing is not necessary, proceed to Para 1.3.3.2.6.
          1.3.3.2.5. A complete resizing of the gaining CSB existing computer data base record
          area should be considered at this point. Failure to resize can result in many problems
          (For example, too many data base records for the space allocated will reduce system
          performance). To determine if resizing is required, take the following steps:
              1.3.3.2.5.1. Use the NGV027 instructions in Para 1.3.3.2.3 above and the
              NGV027 of the affected satellite(s) to add the individual record area totals
              together. If it is determined that a resize is necessary, follow the steps outlined in
              Para 1.3.4 below.
          1.3.3.2.6. Establish applicable IT system Terminal Security.

         1.3.3.2.7. Load applicable IT system areas. If gangs 2 through 4 are being loaded, it
         is not necessary to do the initial load of IT system areas. However, if this is the only
         applicable IT system database on the system, then the initial load of IT system areas
         must be completed. Enter the following command: @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-
         LOAD/SYSAREAS (RUNID = SYSLOD)
         1.3.3.2.8. Load Base Constants.          Process   NGV068A     or   NGV068B,       Base

      the next phase. Most of the inputs at this point in the conversion process were made from
      the pre-conversion item, Para. 1.3.3.3.5 through 1.3.3.4.1 of this section. The steps
      which follow process all the required phrases and the remaining support data. Create
      these data files on the system, then load and process them through the pseudo. For
      additional information on pseudo processing, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3. Note: An

      must be reloaded. The actions listed below complete the conversion process.
      1.3.3.6. Since the conversion program suppressed all normal transactions, the R22
      becomes the auditable document for accounting purposes. The following statement, with
      signatures, will be affixed to the last page of the listing:

      possible so that the SMAG manager can submit a revised AFSF operating program.
   1.3.4. Resizing the Database.
      1.3.4.1. Resizing Procedures. Before resizing, you must first download the database. The
      following run will download the database records to a cataloged tape file
      xGV0*DBDWNLD. It then rewinds the tape, sorts the records by executing NGV058,
      and then writes the sorted output to tape file xGV0*GV-xTP. X equals primary gang.
      Before downloading the database, it must be as free as possible of errors. The download
      program (NGV057) will run with limited pointer errors; however, page errors will abort
      NGV057. First verify your database with Data Management Utility (DMU) and
      NDA500. Remember to ensure all users are advised ahead of time and do not attempt to
      utilize the system until after all resizing procedures have been completed.
          1.3.4.1.1. Process all pseudo inputs and run any required SIFS utilities to clear out
          SIFS data.
          1.3.4.1.2. Process RPTRUN (crossover) on the primary and process all mandatory
          reports on the secondary including RPTEON on the secondary.

         1.3.4.1.3. Process all mandatory reports, including RPTEON, on the primary. Note:
         Important; do not initialize BOD (beginning-of-day). There can be no transactions
         during these resize procedures.
         1.3.4.1.4. Process the following jobs. Ensure they are error free before continuing
         with the next step:

Figure 1.2. Required Jobs for the NGV057 Program.




         1.3.4.1.5. Once the above steps have been accomplished error free, download the
         database. This run downloads the database to tape, rewinds the tape for reading by
         NGV058, then writes the sorted records to a new tape file called xGV0*GV-xTP. x
         equals primary gang. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.DNLOADx
         1.3.4.1.6. After this job finishes, print your output. Visually compare record totals
         downloaded against the output from Verify/GV-x. Totals for most records should
         match. Not all records are downloaded because some are re-created by the upload
         program. Also members or records belonging to empty sets are deleted on the
         download. As stated, download will walk the owners through the members. One thing
         to keep in mind or check for is blank stock numbers on the ITEM-RECORDS.
         Although NGV057 will download these records, NGV052 will NOT upload these
         records because the CALC key is built from the 101-STOCK-NUMBER and 101-
         SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR. If the DNLOADx aborts or a restart is required for any
         reason, just restart DNLOADx. As stated earlier, the DNLOADx does not delete or
         modify database records.
      1.3.4.2. Executing NGVU31. NGVU31 reads and resizes the schema absolute SBSS-
      SCHEMA based upon input from the RPS operator. NGVU31 is menu-driven and
      manual intervention of the output files should not be done. NGVU31 interfaces with
      NDAU31 for schema modification. Manually processing NDAU31 can cause disastrous
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    37


       results. Therefore, SBSS will use NGVU31 to resize their applicable schema. Prior to
       executing NGVU31, save your catalog statements from your DBRUN$ file. NGVU31
       will not put your disk assignments on your new catalog elements. If you don't use disk
       assignments, then there is no need to save these elements. The reason we don't use the
       disk assignments is if your database administrator (DBA) has all disk assignments set to a
       particular size, the new sizes may affect other files on that pack/disk.
           1.3.4.2.1. NGVU31 may be executed anytime and the ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
           run can be processed later. Personnel may size the area(s) in the morning and not
           actually install the new sizes or schema until later. The only run that changes sizes or
           areas is the element created in the file 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-
           SCHEMA. NGVU31 can be executed many times, but actual database sizing changes
           will not take place until the ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA is processed. You must
           process NGVU31 with a nonexempt user-ID.

           1.3.4.2.3. To install new Universal Data System (UDS) and SBSS-SCHEMA,
           process the @START and the @ADD statements below. Also DO NOT start this run
           if your DMC has a UDS dump or UDS reload scheduled. It will not work. This run
           will update the UDS. It will copy the SBSS-SCHEMA into your
           DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA. file and copy all the new catalog statements into
           your       0GV0*DBRUN$.           file.                                     @START
           0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA                           Note: Review the PR
           for errors. Breakpoint file is 0GV0<ALN>*DELSBS. Errors are OK here because the
           program may be trying to delete a file that does not exist. Also, the breakpoint file
           0GV0<ALN>*INSTALL. must have 0-Fatal, 0-Errors on the INSTALL and
           EXPORT portion only. If you have a warning, go to that line and determine if the
           warning was serious. It will show you if that instruction was successful or not. There
           are too many warnings to list. Therefore, determine which type of warning it was.

         REMARKS are okay. Register the new SBSS-SCHEMA just resized via NGVU31 by
         processing the following: @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR
         1.3.4.2.4. Review the catalog statements in your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file for the
         particular gang you resized. They must have the new sizes in the resized areas. If the
         disk assignment options are used, you must ensure the correct disk assignments are
         there. Note: Do not continue until this step is correct!
      1.3.4.3. Post Sizing Procedures. Now you are ready to upload the database. This job will
      read the tape created by the DNLOADx program. The upload may take anywhere
      between 2 and 6 hours to complete based upon the size of your database and system
      saturation. NGV052 will be the longest running upload program because this is the one
      that stores all the item details. After upload, be sure to verify your database. This list
      should be compared with the one before the download. As stated earlier, there will be
      some records not reloaded. Since some application programs may leave empty sets or
      orphan records on the system, they will not be uploaded. Before starting your UPLOAD,
      ensure you modify your new catalog (@CAT) statements in 0GV0*DBRUN$. Process
      the following jobs to reload the database:

Figure 1.5. Modifying New Catalog Statement in 0GV0*DBRUNS.




         1.3.4.3.1. For the ACCOMMODATE option, after you have processed the runstream
         ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA, you have to use ACOPY to reload the incoming
         database.

       1.3.4.4. Resizing TXHIST-GV Area. The transaction history area does not belong to any
       set and does not point outside itself. The download and upload procedures are not
       required to resize this DMS area. This section will cover the steps required to resize your
       TXHIST-GV area. The storage method used for this area is DMS-CALC.
          1.3.4.4.1. Presizing Procedures. Process all reports, including RPTEON on your
          secondary gang. Your secondary gang must be closed out:
              1.3.4.4.1.1. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x (x = secondary gang
              number)
              1.3.4.4.1.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x (x = secondary gang
              number)
          1.3.4.4.2. Process all reports, including RPTEON on your primary gang. Your
          primary gang must be closed out. DMS-CALC uses the input 901-STOCK-NUMBER
          to store the 901 records, then processes the following jobs. x equals primary gang
          number:          @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                           @ADD
          0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31
          1.3.4.4.3. Enter option 1. NGVU31 will prompt for record counts. TAB forward to
          the TXN-HIST field and enter the required number of transactions. Leave all other
          fields on this screen blank. Return to main menu and enter option 5. This will list
          your track sizes for the TXHIST area. If you entered the wrong counts, take option 1
          and reinput your correct count. When ready, continue.

Section 2A—Overview

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines reference information for various planning processes in
materiel management. These processes include Stockage Procedures; War Reserve Materiel;
Degraded Operations; and Readiness Spares Packages and Kits.            Additional Materiel
Management guidance on these processes can be found in AFI 23-101, Materiel Management
and in AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures.

Section 2B—Stockage Procedure

2.2. Stockage Procedure
     2.2.1. Readiness Based Level (RBL) Procedures and Transactions.
        2.2.1.1. Purpose: To provide the procedures and transactions used in the ILS-S to
        implement and maintain centrally computed stock levels RBL.
        2.2.1.2. The Centrally Computed Level (XCA) Transaction is used by AFMC,
        Contractor ICPs, or MAJCOMs to establish, update, or delete centrally computed RBL
        stock levels.

Notes:
1. Reduced Level Flag “S” is used to notify ILS-S that the activity generating the
XCA (AFMC, CICP, or MAJCOM) is aware that the centrally computed stock
level quantity is less than the approved minimum or fixed level(s) at the base.
2. These codes are defined as follows:

Table 2.2. Reconciliation/Update Codes.
       Code         Explanation
       U            A centrally computed level is being provided, or a quantity change
                    is required on a level already loaded.
       R            A level receipt acknowledgment (XCC) has not been received at the
                    XCA generating activity.
       D            The central leveling activity has determined that an entire ISG or
                    bachelor NSN has been removed from RBL computation. Delete
                    RBL pushed levels.
       N            A base has reported a zero daily demand rate and is no longer
                    considered a user of an item. Delete the centrally computed level.
       3. Normally blank. Use TEX code A: Used for re-inputting the XCA to bypass a
       612 (XCA STOCK NUMBER LOADED IN ISG WITH SUBSTITUTES)
       reject.
       TEX code T: Used when a 611 (ITEM RECORD NOT LOADED FOR
       READINESS BASED LEVELING) reject occurs for a stock number that is not
       loaded in the ILS-S.
       4. This field may contain data for D035K purposes but it will be ignored in
       SBSS.
       5. The Optional Application Data field may be used as needed to further
       identify the reason for the central level.
    2.2.2. Level Receipt Acknowledgement.
         2.2.2.1. XCC transactions are used to acknowledge receipt of an AFMC or Contractor
         Inventory Control Point (CICP) centrally computed stock level at the base. In cases
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    43


        where the date of RBL is greater than 210 days old, the ILS-S programmatically initiates
        follow up action to validate the level. See output XCC transaction format in Table 2.3
        2.2.2.2. When an XCA transaction successfully processes in the ILS-S, an XCC
        transaction is produced. When the ILS-S inline follow up program is processed and a
        RBL exists with a date of approval greater than 210 days ago, the ILS-S will generate an
        XCC with an “O” in position 42. The ILS-S will generate an F152 (ISG source code 9 is
        loaded in the ISG) management notice instead of an XCC when a stock number with an
        ISG source code 9 is loaded in the ISG for the item. For these cases, an offline follow up
        must be generated via the manual creation of an XCC to AFMC or a CICP. Upon receipt
        of the follow up, the source of the XCA will send the base an XCA to either delete or
        update the RBL. If after 240 days beyond the RBL approval date, a reply has still not
        received from the source of XCA, the central level will be programmatically deleted by
        the ILS-S and a system-generated XCC will be forwarded to the source of XCA. The
        XCC will contain 99999 in positions 25-29 and a T in position 42. If the XCC
        transaction does not pass the wholesale system edits, a 7MS reject notification is returned
        to the base. Para 2.2.3 provides instructions for correcting central level reject (7MS)
        conditions.

Notes:
1. TEX Code. Normally blank. TEX Code C notifies AFMC/CICP initiator of
the XCA that the RBL was loaded with a different quantity than the quantity on
the XCA. This occurs when an RBL was received with a quantity greater than a
maximum or fixed level. This precludes the source of the XCA from responding
to an XCC with a 7MS reject transaction. TEX code C should not be used when
reprocessing an XCA as the result of a 612 (Stock Number Loaded in ISG with
Substitutes) reject.
2. NSN. Taken from the original XCA input. If the XCC is manually prepared
as the result of a 612 reject, ensure these fields reflect the same information as
the incoming XCA.
3. Interchangeable & Substitute Subgroup Code. Taken from original XCA. If
the XCC is manually prepared, these fields may be blank.
4. The ILS-S will normally take this code from the input XCA. The ILS-S may
assign a different code as the result of reprocessing XCA rejects. The ILS-S will
assign an O in position 42 if the central level RBL allocation date is greater than
210 days and the XCA source either has not updated or deleted the central level.
The ILS-S will assign a T in position 42 when a central level RBL is
programmatically deleted because the date of approval is over 240 days. The
ILS-S will assign an N in position 42 if a base has reported a zero daily demand
rate and is no longer considered a user of an item. The centrally computed level
is deleted.
5. RBL exists for the NSN in the XCA transaction, use code C. If the central
level is not loaded in the ILS-S, use incompatibility code I.
6. Positions 25-29 may contain 99999 when the original XCA does not pass
certain edits or when manually prepared after an F031 (Item Record Source
Code is Other Than Alpha) management notice has been worked.
7. This is the Date Level Computed from the XCA.

  2.2.4. Centrally Computed Levels vs. Approved Minimum or Fixed Levels.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                47


     2.2.4.1. There are two instances when a centrally computed RBL level can be less than
     an approved minimum or fixed level: 1) there is insufficient worldwide requirement to
     allocate to the minimum/fixed level, or 2) the base’s minimum/fixed level is not
     registered in the D035E (or other central leveling) system. This section provides detailed
     instruction for identifying and rectifying (where appropriate) these instances. .
     Exception: Any item identified as Low Density Levels (LDL) required in support of base
     communications-electronic needs are exempt from insufficient RBL pushes. When
     approved LDLs exist in D035E or other centrally leveling system, the central leveling
     system will honor those LDL needs even if the worldwide Organizational Intermediate
     Maintenance (OIM) requirement is less than the sum of the LDLs.
     2.2.4.2. When a readiness based level RBL is less than the approved minimum/fixed
     level quantity due to insufficient worldwide requirement, the RBL level will be identified
     with an “S” in position 7 of the XCA transaction. The ILS-S will establish the RBL level
     for the quantity on the XCA and store the “S” in the 216-RBL-Override field on the RBL
     adjusted level detail. An F233 management notice (RBL QUANTITY LESS THAN
     MINIMUM/FIXED LEVEL QUANTITIES) and a 16L automatic inquiry will be
     produced to notify the LRS CC/AO; however, no further action is necessary.
     2.2.4.3. If the RBL quantity is less than the approved minimum/fixed level quantity and
     the XCA does not contain an “S” in position 7, then the base’s minimum/fixed level is
     probably not registered in the D035 system, and therefore not included in the worldwide
     (D200A) requirement. In this situation, the ILS-S programmatically initiates the
     following actions:
        2.2.4.3.1. The ILS-S will still establish an RBL adjusted level detail for the quantity
        on the XCA input.
        2.2.4.3.2. The ILS-S will generate an XE4 with an “I” in position 67 for each
        Base/AFMC SCM-R approved minimum/fixed level (type level A-C or E) loaded to
        the NSN and any interchangeable items linked to the NSN. The XE4 will notify
        AFMC/CICP there is a mismatch between the RBL quantity and the approved
        minimum/fixed level. If the ASL is base-initiated, D035E/CICP central leveling
        system will compare the XE4 to the RBL database. If the XE4 and the RBL do not
        match, an ASL Reject Notification (XE5) with reject code “R” will be returned to the
        reporting base. This indicates that the Materiel Manager did not input the approved
        base-initiated ASL into the RBL database. These rejects need to be corrected
        immediately (see Para 2.2.24 for XE5 corrective actions) because releveling in the
        Materiel Management system is suppressed as discussed in the paragraph below. If
        the ASL is predetermined, the XE4 will automatically register (load) the reported
        ASL to the RBL database and determine whether or not to perform an out-of-cycle
        RBL allocation.
        2.2.4.3.3. The ILS-S will suppress releveling on this NSN for eight days to give
        AFMC (or CICP) time to react to the mismatch. The four-position Julian date will be
        stored in the 101-Filler-4 field when the XCA is processed. Releveling will compare
        the 101-Filler-4 date with the current computer date and bypass releveling until the
        difference equals eight days. After the eighth day, the item will be releveled and the
        101-Filler-4 date will be deleted. If an XCA is received before the eighth day of
48                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        suppressed releveling that matches the base level, then the 101-filler-field (XE4 date)
        will be blanked. At this time, the RBL will become the base Requisitioning Objective
        (RO). Note: For visibility of this situation, the 101-Filler-4 date is located on an
        inquiry next to the heading: “XE4 Date.”
        2.2.4.3.4. The ILS-S will produce an F233 management notice to notify AFMC
        SCM-R Stock Control Activity that a mismatch condition exists. AFMC SCM-R
        Stock Control can use this information to coordinate with their MAJCOM RBL
        monitor, who, in turn, will coordinate with AFMC/CICP on the need for an out-of-
        cycle RBL allocation.
        2.2.4.3.5. Program NGV915/R47 RBL Mismatch Report will identify these
        mismatch conditions. The R47 provides the capability to list all stock numbers where
        the RBL quantity is less than the approved minimum or fixed level. This report
        serves as a management tool to help ensure AFMC (or the CICP) has taken action to
        register your approved adjusted levels in D035E (or the CICP central leveling
        system). The R47 can be used in lieu of/or in addition to the F233 management
        notice. At a minimum, it should be run ASAP after the quarterly RBL allocation
        takes place.
        2.2.4.3.6. Program NGV917/R49 RBL Misallocation List will identify situations
        where an RBL may be misallocated. This product will be used by AFMC SCM-R
        Stock Control Activity to ensure that RBLs are applied properly when a local I&SG
        relationship exists to ensure erroneous RO are not reported to the D035/CICP central
        leveling system. At a minimum, the R49 should be run ASAP after the quarterly
        RBL allocation takes place. The specific conditions that this product will identify are
        as follows:
           2.2.4.3.6.1. Selection Number 1. Items with an RBL loaded against the master or
           interchangeable stock number and a substitute item within the group has no RBL
           assigned. Corrective action is taken to determine if the RBL needs to be split to
           allocate a portion of the RBL to the substitute item.
           2.2.4.3.6.2. Selection Number 2. Items that have multiple substitute stock
           numbers in the group and not all substitutes have an RBL assigned. Corrective
           action is taken to determine if the substitute stock numbers without an RBL need
           to have a portion of the RBL loaded.
           2.2.4.3.6.3. Selection Number 3. Substitute item with an RBL assigned and there
           are master and interchangeable items in the group without an RBL assigned.
           Corrective action is taken to determine if the master/interchangeable item should
           have an RBL loaded and to validate the RBL on the substitute.
  2.2.5. ILS-S XCA Processing
     2.2.5.1. AFMC communicates centrally computed RBLs to bases via XCA transactions.
     There are a number of ILS-S edits and AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel actions required to successfully process
     XCA transactions. The ILS-S will edit the XCA transactions as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   49


        2.2.5.1.1. The ILS-S will check to see if the stock number is loaded. If the stock
        number in the XCA image is not loaded, the input will generate a 611 reject, Stock
        Number Not Loaded for Readiness Based Level. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
        Activity or LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel monitor must check either
        the online D043A or FEDLOG system to determine if the stock number provided by
        the XCA image belongs to an ISG.
        2.2.5.1.2. If the stock number is in an ISG and at least one of the stock numbers in
        that ISG is loaded in the ILS-S, process TRIC FIL to load the stock number and TRIC
        FIS to link the NSNs in a ILS-S ISG. Reprocess the original XCA transaction.
        2.2.5.1.3. If the stock number is not loaded in the D043B system or none of the
        NSNs in the ISG are loaded at that base, reprocess the XCA image with transaction
        code “T” in position 80. An XCC output image will be produced with “99999” in the
        quantity field, a reconciliation/update code of “N” in position 42 and a
        compatible/incompatible code “I” in position 58. This XCC will advise the XCA
        source that your base is not a user of the item in question.
     2.2.5.2. The ILS-S will check the item record for a numeric parts preference code
     (NPPC) of 3, 5, or 9. Items assigned these NPPCs are not normally included in the
     Readiness Based Leveling allocation. If the NPPC is loaded, the ILS-S will produce an
     F031 management notice, and a BVACO9 SNUD inquiry. When Stock Control
     personnel receive an F031 management notice, they must determine the specific NPPC
     assigned and research either the D043A or FEDLOG to determine if the item is properly
     coded. However, the only NPPCs that are actually listed in FEDLOG are NPPCs 4 and
     9. If the NPPC assigned to the NSN in question is a “2” then check to see if the NSN has
     a phrase code N assigned to it because a phrase code N in the D043A or FEDLOG
     equates to an NPPC “2” in the ILS-S. If the NPPC assigned to the NSN in question is a
     “5” then check to see if the NSN has an acquisition advice code (AAC) of Y assigned to
     it because an AAC Y equates to an NPPC “5” in the ILS-S. AFMC SCM-R Stock
     Control Activity will notify bases of items with a NPPC 2, 3, 4, or 5 loaded against them
     via a monthly listing. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will coordinate with
     using activities on NPPC 2, 3, and 5 items to determine if there is still a valid requirement
     and whether these stock numbers should be retained in the cataloging system as an Air
     Force used item. If the NPPC stock number needs to be retained, the LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity will submit an AF Form 86 with reason code 6 requesting
     reinstatement of the stock number. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control section will take
     actions to delete NPPC 2 and 5 items which are not recommended for retention.
     Customer Service will contact all known users on stock numbers with NPPC 3 loaded
     against them to ensure that all assets are immediately turned into the LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity for disposal. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will take
     action to delete NPPC 3 items once all assets have been turn-in by the LRS. NPPC 9
     items will be managed by AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity. (Note: If the NPPC
     is “4” and this code does not show up in D043A or FEDLOG, contact your TCTO
     monitor to determine if the NPPC “4” is valid).
        2.2.5.2.1. If you determine that the item is not properly coded, process an FCD to
        remove the NPPC and then notify the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity to
        reprocess the original XCA transaction. If the item in question is in an ISG, consider
50                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        the fact that the input transaction reflected the D043B master stock number, not the
        base master.
        2.2.5.2.2. If an ISG exists, it is the base master that is coded with the NPPC, and the
        D043B does not have an NPPC, then process FIS transactions (using source code 9)
        to change the base master item to an interchangeable or substitute item, as deemed
        locally appropriate (see chapter 8 for FIS processing). After this is done, reprocess
        the original XCA (as reflected on the input image on the F031 management notice).
        If the D043B master item appears to be properly coded with an NPPC or if the item is
        not in an ISG and the NPPC appears to be correct, contact your MAJCOM RBL
        monitor. The MAJCOM RBL monitor in turn will coordinate with the RBL monitor
        at the wholesale activity that initiated the RBL to verify the NPPC and to determine if
        the item should either be excluded from the RBL allocation or if some other action is
        necessary.
        2.2.5.2.3. If the NPPC on the D043B master item is verified as correct or the item is
        not in an ISG and the NPPC is verified as correct, manually prepare a level receipt
        acknowledgment (XCC) transaction (using the F031 input image) with an “I” in
        position 58 and a quantity of 99999. Process the XCC through DLATS and then
        destroy the F031 notice.
        2.2.5.2.4. If the NPPC on the D043B master item is not correct or the item is not in
        an ISG and the NPPC is not correct, process a stock control data change (FCD) to
        remove the NPPC, and reprocess the original Centrally Computed Level (XCA)
        transaction using the F031 input image.
     2.2.5.3. The ILS-S will process the XCA (codes R or U) in the following way:
        2.2.5.3.1. The ILS-S will set the RBL Flag on the item record. If the national stock
        number is in an ISG, the ILS-S will set the RBL Flag ON for each NSN in the group.
            2.2.5.3.1.1. The ILS-S will load the adjusted level detail against the input
            national stock number when the NSN is a bachelor item.
            2.2.5.3.1.2. The ILS-S will load the adjusted level detail against the input NSN
            for items in the interchangeable and substitute group (master and interchangeable
            only). If the ISG contains a substitute, a 612 reject will be produced.
            2.2.5.3.1.3. The ILS-S will prepare a level receipt acknowledgment (XCC). The
            NSN will be the same as on the original XCA transaction.
            2.2.5.3.1.4. The ILS-S will blank the file status quarter code field and set the item
            record releveling flag for releveling/file status.
     2.2.5.4. The ILS-S will process the XCA (reconciliation/update codes D or N) in the
     following way:
        2.2.5.4.1. The ILS-S will delete the RBL adjusted level detail for the input NSN. If
        the item is in an ISG, the ILS-S will delete the adjusted level detail for the input NSN.
        2.2.5.4.2. If any stock number in the ISG has an RBL loaded, then the RBL flag will
        remain on for all national stock numbers in the interchangeable and substitute group.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   51


        2.2.5.4.3. The ILS-S will blank the file status quarter code field and set the item
        record releveling flag for releveling/file status.
        2.2.5.4.4. If the item meets the range criteria for a demand level, then the ILS-S will
        compute, restore, and use the demand level.
        2.2.5.4.5. The ILS-S will prepare a level receipt acknowledgement (XCC), except
        when the NSN is not loaded.
     2.2.5.5. The ILS-S will check the reconciliation/update code for D, N, R, or U (see XCA
     input format for definition of codes). If the code is listed as anything else, the ILS-S will
     produce a 003 reject (DOES NOT PASS FUNDS AVAIL EDIT). AFMC SCM-R Stock
     Control Activity or LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel must then verify the
     code with the item manager and reprocess the XCA with the correct code.
     2.2.5.6. The ILS-S will check the Centrally Computed Level in positions 25–29 for
     numbers. If positions 25–29 contain letters or special characters, the ILS-S will produce
     a level receipt acknowledgment (XCC) with 99999 in positions 25–29.
     2.2.5.7. The ILS-S will check the date level computed in positions 75–78 to see if the
     date is greater than the detail date of last approval, and equal to or less than the current
     computer generated date. If positions 75–79 are less than the detail date of last approval,
     or greater than the current computer generated date, the ILS-S will produce a level receipt
     acknowledgment (XCC) with 99999 in positions 25–29.
     2.2.5.8. If any substitute stock number (relationship code S) has an ISG source code
     equal to 9, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     personnel must determine if any portion of the RBL quantity should be applied against
     the substitute stock number. This action is necessary because AFMC and other central
     leveling activities allocate RBL quantities on the D043B master item for the entire
     D043B group regardless of how individual bases have items linked locally. To make this
     determination, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity personnel must check the D043B system to see if the substitute item is in the
     same D043B ISG as the base master. If the items are in the same D043B group, then the
     RBL quantity will have to be divided up among the base master/interchangeable
     relationship and the base substitute(s).
     2.2.5.9. If required, divide the RBL quantity among the master/interchangeable stock
     number and substitute stock numbers. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel must prepare and process XCA inputs
     against the master and each substitute stock number that has ISG source code 9. These
     XCA inputs must have a transaction code A in position 80 and the appropriate quantity to
     be applied to the master and each individual substitute. Note: If substitute items exist
     with ISG source code other than 9, then no manually prepared XCA is necessary because
     these items will either get an RBL themselves or SNUD ISG processing will change them
     to interchangeable items. The sum of the quantities on these XCA inputs cannot exceed
     the quantity on the original XCA. Personnel must ensure an XCA is processed against
     the master and all substitute stock numbers that have ISG source code 9, even if the
     quantity is not sufficient to apply a positive level to each stock number. If the quantity is
     not sufficient to divide among the master and all substitute items, process an XCA with a
52                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


     zero level for the master or for each substitute without a positive RBL level in the group.
     For AFMC and CICP-managed items, after the XCA transactions with an A in position
     80 are processed (regardless of how the RBL quantity is divided up), AFMC SCM-R
     Stock Control Activity or LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel must manually
     prepare and send one level receipt acknowledgment (XCC) transaction for the group
     reflecting the stock number and quantity received on the original XCA transaction (from
     the 612 reject input image). If this action is not performed correctly, AFMC/CICPs will
     return a 7MS reject that must also be manually worked.
     2.2.5.10. When the base closure flag is ON, the RBL central level will not be loaded;
     however, a level receipt acknowledgment (XCC) with 99999 in positions 25–29 and
     reconciliation/update code N and an incompatibility code I will be produced. XCC will
     not be produced for RIDs other than Fxx.
     2.2.5.11. When the RBL quantity is greater than an approved maximum or fixed level
     loaded at the base, the ILS-S will change the RBL quantity to equal the quantity on the
     maximum or fixed level. For AFMC/CICP-managed items, the ILS-S will generate an
     XCC with a C in position 7 to notify the appropriate central leveling system of the change
     to the RBL quantity. In addition, it will generate an XE4 on the maximum or fixed level
     to ensure the level is accurately registered in the central leveling system.
     2.2.5.12. When an F432 management notice (depot overhaul item) is received and
     permanent suppression is desired, delete the RBL detail immediately and load a
     maximum adjusted stock level of 0. If the NSN should be ordered by immediate level
     maintenance, i.e., Wing/Base for programmed depot maintenance (PDM), follow the
     instructions in AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5.
  2.2.6. Central Level Inquiry.
     2.2.6.1. When an AFMC/CICP-managed NSN is identified that has at least one demand
     but does not have a central level RBL loaded, the ILS-S produces a Central Level inquiry
     (DIC XCE). The procedures for processing the XCE and the XCE transaction format are
     detailed in this section.
     2.2.6.2. A Central Level inquiry (DIC XCE) is output by the ILS-S during releveling or
     file status when an item is identified that has at least one demand but does not have a
     central level loaded. Upon receipt of the XCE, the source of the RBL will determine if a
     central level is available for the requested stock number. If a central level exists, they
     will return an XCA. After the XCA is generated or if no central level is available, the
     source of the central level will treat the XCE the same as an XCB (see AFH 23-123, Vol
     2, Pt 2, Ch 5). The XCE transaction format is provided below. The date the XCE was
     generated is stored in the first four positions of the 101-XCE-Date field. This date will
     be deleted upon receipt of an XCA. If no XCA is received within 90 days of the inquiry,
     the ILS-S releveling program will format another XCE and update the date in 101-XCE-
     Date. The date the XCE was generated is visible on an item record inquiry next to the
     heading: “XCE Date.” The LVL transaction input can be used to generate an XCE on an
     as-needed basis. The LVL transaction format is provided in Para 2.2.40
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    53

      2.2.6.3. A DDR confirmation request may be generated by AFMC or CICP central
      leveling systems when wholesale personnel suspect an item (ISG roll-up or bachelor
      item) has an erroneous DDR (greater than .75) or when the central leveling system has
      not received an updated DDR/PBR report image (XCB) in over 90 days. An XCD may
      also be internally created as result of a Redistribution Order (RDO) denial (B7x) or
      manually input to force a new (XCB) output to the central leveling system. This input
      will create a 4G history for the input stock number and for every item in ISG. The 4G
      histories will be scanned by the D28 to generate an XCB output.

  2.2.7. Customer Oriented Leveling Technique (COLT) Procedures.
     2.2.7.1. Purpose: To provide the procedures and methodology used by the Customer
     Oriented Leveling Technique (COLT) to compute and maintain centrally computed stock
     levels for Non-AF-managed items.
     2.2.7.2. COLT computes base stock levels for Non-AF-managed consumable (XB3) and
     equipment (NF1) items. COLT uses a marginal analysis method to assign levels items
     that provide the best reduction in expected backorders per dollar. Its logic considers DLA
     support levels, demand variability, demand rates, pipeline times, unit price, and other
     factors to minimize expected backorders. This section describes how the COLT system
     works and how the ILS-S receives and implements COLT levels.
        2.2.7.2.1. The overall objective of COLT is to minimize base-wide unit customer
        wait time per given investment. COLT does this by minimizing time-weighted
        expected backorders (EBO) per dollar. CWT is then computed as EBO/Daily Demand
        Rate across all items for the base account. This results in COLT providing Air Force
        bases with a collective set of stock levels that will produce the lowest base-wide unit
        customer wait time (CWT) across all Non-AF-managed items for the given
        investment.
        2.2.7.2.2. Most of the COLT processes are managed centrally by the AF COLT
        Team. This team is managed at AFMC with team members at several locations.
     2.2.7.3. Centrally computed COLT levels override base computed stock levels and any
     existing adjusted stock levels (ASL) and become the basis for base peace-time
     consumable item stock requisitioning. However, COLT will honor existing ASLs when
     computing its levels. For items without a centrally computed COLT level that meet the
     range criteria for a base computed stock level, the ILS-S will continue to calculate and
     use base computed stock levels. Thus, sometimes the base supply system computes the
     initial level until the quarterly COLT level is computed and overrides it.
     2.2.7.4. The computation of COLT levels considers both base-level usage data and
     resupply pipeline times, including depot delay. As shown in Figure 2.3 the COLT
     process considers all parts, wholesale and retail, of the inventory pipeline – not just the
     base portions. The COLT process uses base specific data to determine the optimum levels
     for minimal base-wide unit customer wait time per investment. There are two primary
     sources of data for COLT: the Air Force Supply Centralized Database and the DLA
     database.

        2.2.7.5. The input data from the Air Force Supply Centralized Database provides most of
        the COLT input data referred to as the COLT Input File. Data from SBSS accounts are
        provided to the Centralized Database daily. So by obtaining data from this source, COLT
        is getting actual base data for each base without having to go through the MAJCOMs or
        bases.
           2.2.7.5.1. The COLT Input File is a comma-delimited, variable length file. Table 2.8
           provides the record layout.

          2.2.7.5.2. The input data from DLA provides data on DLA stock availability and
          depot delay and is referred to as the Wholesale Delay Time (WDT) Input File. Data
          from DLA is provided to the AF COLT Team quarterly. The AF COLT Team
          reformats the data provided by DLA to form the WDT Input File. The WDT Input
          File is an MS Access database file with a single table.

       2.2.7.6. COLT leveling applies to most Non-AF-managed consumable items (XB3) and
       equipment items (NF1). Thus COLT levels, DLA, GSA, and other services consumable
       items; it does not level contractor ICP items. An item must have a positive cumulative
       recurring demand to be considered for a COLT level. In addition, COLT does not
       produce stock levels for items with stockage priority code (SPC) E or acquisition advice
       codes (AACs) F, L, V or Y. Items that do not receive a COLT level will be considered
       for levels by the SBSS retail system. It is important to note that there is a difference
       between not being considered for a level by COLT and receiving a COLT level of 0.
       Items meeting the criteria above will receive a COLT level, but that level will sometimes
       be 0. In determining the levels, COLT weighs numerous factors for every item and
       optimizes across all considered items for that stock record account number within a given
       cost target. Sometimes it is better to provide a zero level on one item so that other items
       can receive greater stock levels. Any backorders on the first item will be more than offset
       by the availability of other items due to their increased levels.
       2.2.7.7. COLT is processed quarterly at AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity for each
       base running COLT. To spread the workload, COLT levels are computed for one-third of
       the bases each month of the quarter. The COLT input data is extracted during the third
       week of each month and the levels computed immediately afterwards. The AFMC SCM-
       R Stock Control Activity COLT Team reviews all levels to ensure the model is operating
       properly and that the computed levels are reasonable. The levels are then provided to
       MAJCOMs and the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity for their optional review.
       Afterwards, the levels are sent to the base via DAAS for automatic loading into the ILS-
       S.
          2.2.7.7.1. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity COLT Team communicates
          centrally computed COLT levels to the ILS-S via electronic transactions (TRIC
          XCA). Note: the COLT reorder point (ROP) is also transmitted on the XCA
          transaction. The XCA transactions are transceived through DLATS. After the COLT
          transaction passes internal edits, the ILS-S loads the COLT level on a type F adjusted
          stock level detail. The application SRAN tasking field has “COLT” in the first four
          positions. The COLT levels will always be sent to bases on the AFMC master NSN
          for items coded as interchangeables (I) in an interchangeable and substitute group
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   61


        (I&SG). Items in I&SGs but coded as substitutes (S) are treated as bachelor items for
        COLT processing. Refer to Para 2.2.1 for XCA processing procedures.
        2.2.7.7.2. COLT levels must differ from the existing COLT level by more the square
        root of the existing level. During level computation, if the model deems an item
        should be assigned a level equal to the existing level minus the square root, the level
        will be increased to equal the existing level. That item will continue to compete for
        levels. However, unless that item receives more than the existing level plus the square
        root, it will not change. If the model determines the desired level is within a square
        root of the existing level (from existing level – sqrt[existing level] to existing level +
        sqrt[existing level]), then the existing level will not change. This rule provides for
        stability by preventing trivially small changes to the level, which can cause
        requisitions, excess, and workload for little gain.
     2.2.7.8. COLT has several constraints (caps) to control the depth of leveling.
        2.2.7.8.1. Stockage Priority Code (SPC) 5 items are capped at the existing on hand
        balance. If there is no on-hand balance, then the COLT level will be forced to zero.
        2.2.7.8.2. The total COLT level is capped at $4K extended cost (if the SBSS demand
        level = 0) or $5K more than SBSS demand level (if the SBSS demand level > 0).
        COLT will sometimes provide significantly more depth of levels than the SBSS
        computed demand level. Doing so can produce stockage problems and requisition
        rejections. This cap reduces the likelihood of those events.
        2.2.7.8.3. The COLT leveling is stopped when the COLT computed                   expected
        backorders (EBO) are less than 0.0027 (about one demand per year).              This cap
        prevents the model from continuing to assign levels to an item when the         projected
        backorder days are less than 1 per year. That is, it stops when the model is    receiving
        minimal returns.
        2.2.7.8.4. COLT uses the same economic order quantity (EOQ) as the SBSS-
        computed demand level, which is capped at one year’s demand quantity. COLT also
        constrains the COLT reorder point (ROP) to one year’s demand quantity. These caps
        are designed to prevent overstocking.
        2.2.7.8.5. COLT uses the same Shelf Life Code (SLC) as SBSS. COLT uses the
        SLC to look up the number of days of shelf life. This is multiplied by the Daily
        Demand Rate times ½. The resulting value is the COLT SLC cap.
        2.2.7.8.6. There are several rules in COLT that restrict when to start leveling an item.
        As described in the COLT item identification, items with certain AACs or with a SPC
        E will receive no COLT level. Below are additional rules.
        2.2.7.8.7. COLT restricts stock levels for IEU items (FSG 84 and FSC 4240) and
        HAZMAT items (IEX 9). COLT only provides levels on these items if SBSS demand
        level > 0. In addition, COLT will not stock any item with a Max Level of 0 or an
        SPC of E. This restriction accommodates MAJCOM policies limiting the use of IEU
        and HAZMAT items in SBSS.
        2.2.7.8.8. COLT has an initial leveling rule to prevent initially stocking an item when
        the chance of a future demand is small. COLT will push a 0 level on these items.
62                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        The criteria are: Number of User Demands are 0 or 1, bench stock level is 0, date of
        last demand older than 90 days or date of first demand less than 365 days old, no on
        hand balance, not SPC 5, and not MIC 1. Any item meeting all these criteria will
        receive a 0 level.
        2.2.7.8.9. COLT has an “exclusion/zero” list maintained by the AF COLT team,
        modified by the MAJCOMs/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity that excludes
        items in identified federal stock classes (FSC) at identified bases from receiving
        positive levels. Additions or changes are approved by MAJCOMs/AFMC SCM-R
        Stock Control Activity and sent to the AF COLT Team. The AF COLT Team will
        review and update the database. If an item is from the listed FSCs at the listed base,
        then COLT will push a 0 level. This keeps entire stock classes from receiving
        positive levels even though they might have demands. If the exclusion/zero list
        forces a zero level, then when the COLT level is loaded, an “X” will be placed in
        position 6 of the application SRAN tasking field on the Type F COLT ASL.
        2.2.7.8.10. If a base closure flag is set on an item, COLT will not provide a new level
        for it and will delete any existing COLT level. SBSS will take over and set the
        demand level to 0. The 0 demand level will prevent replenishment requisitions;
        however due outs and Adjusted Stock Levels will still be replenished and considered
        as part of the requisitioning objective. The base closure flag can be used for mission
        changes where an item is no longer going to be used on that base.
     2.2.7.9. Below are rules that override the COLT logic, forcing a level more or less than
     COLT would otherwise compute.
        2.2.7.9.1. There is an exception for Mission Impact Code (MIC) 1 and Stockage
        Priority Code (SPC) A items. COLT guarantees a positive level on these items (unless
        they have an SPC 5 assigned with no on-hand assets). This ensures In addition, if the
        COLT level is greater than 1, then the reorder point is set to at least 1. Further, the
        ROP is set to at least 2 if the level is at greater than 2 and the pipeline quantity is at
        least 2. These rules ensure these critical items are likely to have some stock available
        to prevent MICAPS.
        2.2.7.9.2. COLT will honor approved adjusted stock levels. COLT will assign levels
        that are at least equal to the approved minimum level quantity, no more than the
        approved maximum level quantity, or a quantity equal to the approved fixed level
        loaded at the base.
        2.2.7.9.3. COLT considers bench stock and consumable readiness spares packages in
        its leveling. So consideration of bench stock/CRSP is required to provide the best
        overall support to the customer. COLT considers an average of 75% of the bench
        stock plus CRSP level to be on-hand to reduce backorders.
        2.2.7.9.4. COLT uses the standard SBSS mission change details (see Para 2.2.9) to
        modify demand for changing missions. The DDR is either increased or decreased
        appropriately prior to any COLT computation.
     2.2.7.10. COLT has a special pre-processor for the Air Mobility Command (AMC)
     Forward Supply Location (FSL) Spares.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  63


        2.2.7.10.1. Forward Supply Locations (FSLs) are part of the AMC Forward Supply
        System (FSS) and provide stock in the AMC Strategic Airlift en route system
        supporting the C-5 and C-17 strategic airlift.
        2.2.7.10.2. The FSL Pre-processor uses special FSL logic to compute a level and
        passes that to the primary COLT model. When COLT levels are computed for the
        base, FSL levels are treated like ASLs that must be met. In order to determine which
        items to level, a candidate file is required. The candidate NSNs and FSLs are
        determined by AMC and are an input to the COLT computational process. AMC
        provides a quarterly file to COLT containing all applicable stock numbers by FSL
        category. The file also contains data on percentage of demands from the FSS (vice
        regular base) and two-year demand values. The FSS logic uses both individual base
        data, and FSS-wide data to determine levels. The logic has been in use at AMC and
        is similar to logic in RBL (D035E) for AF-managed items. The COLT FSS logic
        uses a proactive demand forecasting algorithm; that is an FSL can receive positive
        levels where there is sufficient likelihood of future need based on historical fleet-wide
        demand.
        2.2.7.10.3. When COLT levels are loaded, the application SRAN tasking field on the
        Type F ASL has “COLT” in the first four positions. If the FSL logic drives the
        levels, then position 6 will have an “F”.
  2.2.8. Proactive Demand Leveling (PDL) Program.
     2.2.8.1. Provide the procedures and methodology used by the Proactive Demand
     Leveling (PDL) Technique to compute stock levels for DLA-managed sparsely used
     items.
        2.2.8.1.1. This narrative describes how the PDL system works and how the ILS-S
        receives and implements PDL levels.
        2.2.8.1.2. The overall objective of PDL is to reduce the number of cause code A (and
        B) MICAPs on DLA-managed consumable items. Items with little or no demands
        and no level at a particular base can have MICAPs, often a significant portion of the
        MICAP incidents and hours. PDL tries to predict which items might have a future
        MICAP and place levels there in advance of the demands. PDL does this by using
        demands at bases using the same weapon system as a base targeted to potentially
        receive levels. Since the target base has little or no demands, the other bases
        “donate” their demand histories. PDL uses this demand data along with MICAP
        information, and unit price to determine if an item will actually be leveled.
        2.2.8.1.3. The basic PDL logic does the following. Potentially level an item at a
        targeted base if:
           2.2.8.1.3.1. A sufficient number of bases in the enterprise have used an item in
           the past
           2.2.8.1.3.2. And those bases use the same weapon system as the targeted bass
           2.2.8.1.3.3. And the item has caused a MICAP in the past
           2.2.8.1.3.4. And the item is economical
64                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.2.8.1.4. Most of the PDL processes are now managed centrally by the AFMC
        SCM-R Stock Control Activity PDL Team.
     2.2.8.2. Although PDL is a standalone model, it uses some COLT data in its computation
     and it uses the COLT system to push the resulting levels to the base. PDL runs as a pre-
     processor to COLT, using a special PDL data as well as COLT input files (Table 2.8) to
     compute the PDL levels. Those levels are passed to COLT which treats them like
     minimum ASLs. That is, COLT starts leveling at the PDL quantity (rather than 0) and
     could allocate more to the item. Although it’s rare for COLT to allocate more since there
     is little or no local demand. The final level is pushed to the base by COLT.
     2.2.8.3. PDL is limited to Non-AF-managed consumable items. There are certain items
     that are excluded from consideration. Since PDL is using enterprise-wide demands, the
     definition of what to consider is also required.
        2.2.8.3.1. Certain items are excluded from consideration:
            2.2.8.3.1.1. Hazardous material items are excluded. Issue exception code cannot
            be 8 or 9 and the Health Hazard Flag must be blank or 0
            2.2.8.3.1.2. “Alpha” NIINs are excluded. NIINs must begin with a number;
            NIINs beginning with a letter (such as L, N, or P) are excluded.
            2.2.8.3.1.3. Terminal items are excluded. Acquisition advice code cannot be V or
            Y.
            2.2.8.3.1.4. Certain Federal Supply Classes (FSC)/Federal Supply Groups (FSG)
            are excluded. Current exclusions include FSC 4240, 6135, 6140, 6165, 6465,
            6810, 6820, 6830, 6840, 6850, 7910, 7930, 8960, 9110, 9130, 9135, 9140, 9150,
            and 9160; and FSG 65, 80, and 84
        2.2.8.3.2. For each MDS/Target Base (or groups of target bases) the following
        information is required: list of enterprise bases to use (called the donor bases), # of
        donor bases that must have a demand, standard reporting designators (SRDs) to use,
        unit price thresholds, list of target bases, and a unique name. This information is
        called the MDS Run Definition. If all values are the same for two different target
        bases, then the same MDS Run Definition is used for both. However, if anything is
        different, then a different MDS Run Definition is required.
     2.2.8.4. PDL Process.
        2.2.8.4.1. PDL is processed quarterly by the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
        PDL Team for each base using PDL. The schedule is the same as the COLT schedule.
        COLT levels are computed for one-third of the bases each month of the quarter. PDL
        levels will be computed about 1 week prior to the COLT levels being run each month.
        The PDL data is extracted and the pre-processor run right away. The Central PDL
        Team reviews all levels to ensure the model is operating properly and that the
        computed levels are reasonable. The levels are then provided to the AFMC SCM-R
        Weapon System Management/Stock Control Activity for their optional review.
        Afterwards, the PDL levels are automatically sent to the primary COLT model after
        the review period.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 65


         2.2.8.4.2. An AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Management/Stock Control Activity
         review is incorporated into the process.         AFMC SCM-R Weapon System
         Management/Stock Control Activity will have about 1 week to review PDL levels
         prior to being passed to the COLT model for processing. Spreadsheets with detailed
         data will be provided on the COLT Enterprise Information System (EIS)/SharePoint
         site. The user should review the items based on their own criteria. However, the goal
         of the review is to make sure that the results make sense and to eliminate items that
         are questionable. PDL levels will be pushed if the PDL Team is not notified of
         changes (default is to push).
      2.2.8.5. Computing PDL Levels Details.
         2.2.8.5.1. The PDL computation goes through four steps: Importing, Computing
         MDS results, Computing Target Base results, and Exporting Data. The data imported
         is a special data extraction from the AF Supply Central Databank, described in the
         next section. The next step uses the PDL algorithm to identify potential items for
         leveling for any base using the MDS and the demand criteria. The third step uses the
         potential list of items and a COLT input file for the targeted base to identify the
         specific items to be leveled at a given target base. Finally, the data can be exported
         for review and submission to the main COLT model.
         2.2.8.5.2. The PDL data file is extracted from the AF Supply Central Databank using
         Oracle scripts. The file is a fixed-width, standard text file. The pulls all items that
         meet the following criteria:
              2.2.8.5.2.1. Budget Code (BC) = 9
              2.2.8.5.2.2. ERRCD = XB3 or XF3
              2.2.8.5.2.3. Depot Routing Identifier (RID) = S** (DLA Managed)

              2.2.8.5.2.5. Health Hazard Flag (HHF) = Blank or 0 (Not HAZMAT)
              2.2.8.5.2.6. Acquisition Advice Code (AAC) NOT V or Y (Not terminal item)
              2.2.8.5.2.7. Not Stockage Priority Code (SPC) E
              2.2.8.5.2.8. No Base Closure Flag Loaded
              2.2.8.5.2.9. No Mission Change Loss Loaded
              2.2.8.5.2.10. Unit Price (UP) < $2K (further modified later)
              2.2.8.5.2.11. Not an “alpha” NIIN (0-9 in 1st position of NIIN)
              2.2.8.5.2.12. Positive CRD or ND

           2.2.8.5.3. The PDL algorithm is an enterprise-wide demand leveling system as
           follows:
              2.2.8.5.3.1. If a sufficient number of bases in the enterprise have used an item in
              the past
              2.2.8.5.3.2. and those bases use the same weapon system as the “target base”
              2.2.8.5.3.3. and the item has caused a MICAP in the past
              2.2.8.5.3.4. Then potentially level the item at the target base
           2.2.8.5.4. The sufficient number of bases is determined by the “PDL Criteria”. For
           each MDS Run, the number of bases with demands is provided. Usually it is referred
           to as X out of Y – for example, 3 out of 10 bases examined must have had a demand.
           In this case, the demand means both cumulative recurring demands (CRD) and
           number of user demands (ND). Therefore the rule is:
              2.2.8.5.4.1. The number of bases with positive CRD >= MDS Run Criteria
              2.2.8.5.4.2. The number of bases with positive ND >= MDS Run Criteria
           2.2.8.5.5. The weapon system is determined by using Standard Reporting
           Designators (SRDs) contained on Weapon System Details (WSDs). Part of the run
           definition is the list of donor bases and the list of SRDs. The WSDs for each donor
           base are examined, pulling out NSNs that have the identified SRDs.
68                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.2.8.5.6. A past MICAP at a base is reflected in the Mission Impact Code (MIC)
        being set to 1. So if any of the donor bases have a MIC 1 set and a positive demand
        level, then we can infer the item has had a past MICAP and will be considered for
        PDL leveling.
     2.2.8.6. The PDL business rules further restrict items to receive PDL levels. These rules
     are used to control cost, remove unwanted items, and improve predictability.
        2.2.8.6.1. In order to restrict the items considered for levels, an NSN being
        considered must meet the following rules:
            2.2.8.6.1.1. Budget Code (BC) = 9
            2.2.8.6.1.2. ERRCD = XB3 or XF3
            2.2.8.6.1.3. Depot Routing Identifier (RID) = S** (DLA Managed)
            2.2.8.6.1.4. Issue Exception Code (IEX) NOT 8 or 9 (Not HAZMAT)
            2.2.8.6.1.5. Health Hazard Flag (HHF) = Blank or 0 (Not HAZMAT)
            2.2.8.6.1.6. Acquisition Advice Code (AAC) NOT V or Y (Not terminal item)

        2.2.8.6.2. DL has two Unit Price (UP) thresholds: lower UP threshold and upper UP
        threshold; which are set for each MDS Run Definition. The upper threshold removes
        all NSNs more than the upper threshold value while the lower threshold removes
        some additional items based on location of demands. The lower threshold defaults to
        $100 and the upper threshold defaults to $751. The details are:
            2.2.8.6.2.1. $0 < UP < UP Lower Threshold. Potentially level any item at the
            target base that meets the other rules
            2.2.8.6.2.2. UP Lower Threshold < UP < UP Upper Threshold. Potentially level
            an item at the target base only if the cumulative recurring demands are positive at
            the target base
            2.2.8.6.2.3. UP Upper Threshold < UP. Do not level the item using PDL
        2.2.8.6.3. There are certain Federal Stock Classes (FSCs) or Federal Stock Groups
        (FSGs) that we do not want to include in PDL. The list of exclusions can be changed
        for all users within the model. However, the current list is:

        2.2.8.6.4. MICAPs on items that have other sources of levels would not result in a
        Cause Code A or B MICAP. Since PDL was designed to reduce Cause Code A and B
        MICAPs, these items are eliminated from receiving PDL levels. Specifically, if the
        item at the Target base has any of the following, it will not receive a PDL level:
            2.2.8.6.4.1. Min Adjusted Stock Level (ASL)
            2.2.8.6.4.2. Fixed ASL
            2.2.8.6.4.3. Max 0 ASL
            2.2.8.6.4.4. Bench Stock
            2.2.8.6.4.5. Positive Demand Level and not previous PDL caused
     2.2.8.7. If an item passes all the previous rules, it will receive a PDL level. That is, if it
     passes the algorithm checks (sufficient number of bases with past demands, with the right
     SRDs, and a past MICAP) and business rules (Basic Rules, UP thresholds, FSC
     exclusions, and no other levels) then level at the target.
        2.2.8.7.1. The PDL level is the average lot size. Average Lot Size = Cumulative
        Recurring Demands / Number of User Demands, rounded. An Average Lot Size can
70                                                        AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        be computed for the target base (if it has demands) or for the enterprise based on total
        CRD and total ND for the donor bases. Below shows when each Lot Size is used:
        2.2.8.7.2. $0 < UP < UP Lower Threshold. Use the target base lot size if there are
        demands (CRD>0 and ND>0). Otherwise, used the enterprise lot size
        2.2.8.7.3. UP Lower Threshold < UP < UP Upper Threshold. Use the target base lot
        size (since there must be demands)
        2.2.8.7.4. The PDL level is capped by a Max ASL (>0) if one exists at the Target
        SRAN.
        2.2.8.7.5. The PDL level can be modified by the Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) if the
        option is selected. The QUP option is available for each MDS Run definition. If an
        item has a QUP at the Target base or any donor base, take the largest QUP code for
        the donor and target bases. Convert the QUP code into a QUP quantity (ex., QUP=Q,
        QUP Qty=100). Take the larger of the PDL level and the QUP Qty if the QUP option
        is set.
        2.2.8.7.6. If a PDL level already exists at the Target base, the new PDL level will be
        used as an update to that level.
        2.2.8.7.7. If an item is used for multiple MDS at the same Target base, the PDL level
        is computed for each MDS and COLT takes the largest of the PDL levels computed.
     2.2.8.8. PDL will delete an existing level if all of these conditions exist:
        2.2.8.8.1. Date of Last Demand over 2 years old. Old or no demands at the target
        base. Don’t delete items with only recent demands at the target base
        2.2.8.8.2. Last PDL level placed over 1 year ago. No longer qualifies for PDL. But
        don’t delete items that qualified recently for a PDL level to reduce volatility
        2.2.8.8.3. First PDL placed over 2 years ago. Give the levels time to work.
     2.2.8.9. When an ILS-S demand level exceeds an existing PDL, the PDL ASL is
     programmatically deleted. If an item has an ILS-S demand level for a quantity less than
     the PDL level, maintain the PDL ASL. For the PDL items with no ILS-S demand level,
     review the PDL ASL at least every two years to ensure the item is still a required asset. If
     so, maintain the PDL ASL as long as the criterion for proactively stocking the item
     applies. PDL items will fall under AF retention policy when the PDL criteria no longer
     applies and the PDL ASL is deleted.
        2.2.8.9.1. Purpose: Discuss the GU1M2MWG.NEW HQ AMC PCL01 Discoverer
        Query that provides the user with the worldwide data supporting a pre-defined
        weapon system/Grounds support. Users should include all or a portion of the
        worldwide locations with like weapon system/Grounds support configurations.
        2.2.8.9.2. Program Logic. The DISCOVERER script selects item records based on
        the following criteria:
            2.2.8.9.2.1. Budget code = 9.
            2.2.8.9.2.2. ERRCD = XB3 or XF3.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               71


            2.2.8.9.2.3. First position of RID = S.
            2.2.8.9.2.4. Unit price < $1,500
            2.2.8.9.2.5. Health hazard flag = blank or 0.
            2.2.8.9.2.6. Issue Exception Code NOT equal to 8 or 9.
            2.2.8.9.2.7. Acquisition Advice Code NOT equal to V or Y.
            2.2.8.9.2.8. SRAN = SRANs provided by AFMC SCM-R.
            2.2.8.9.2.9. Weapon System Detail (WSD) SRD = SRD provided by AFMC
            SCM-R. Note: The WSD can be identified as 216 adjusted stock level records
            with level justification code 0.
     2.2.8.10. The following actions will be performed:
        2.2.8.10.1. Sign on to ILS-S DISCOVERER and process the public script,
        GU1M2MWG.NEW HQ AMC PCL01. It is highly recommended using the “Create
        Queries” option, as the “View Queries” option is not user friendly when using
        parameters.
        2.2.8.10.2. Export the DISCOVERER output file by selecting “Export” under the file
        tab. Click “Next”, and change the format to “Text (Tab delimited) (*.txt)”. Change
        file save directory to the PCL01 directory. Make sure the export is with the file name
        PCL01IN.txt. You will need to know the base SRAN(S) and SRD(S) needed before
        starting the DISCOVERER query. Note: If DISCOVERER displays an extensive
        runtime and will not complete, process the program entering one SRAN at a time.
        Merge the files together to form a single PCL01IN.txt file.
        2.2.8.10.3. File for input to AMC PCL01, filename should be PCL01IN.txt. Special
        Processing Instructions: The PCL01 DISCOVERER query selects records using the
        SRD in the weapon system detail (WSD – 216 adjusted stock level records).
        Therefore, it is possible that a stock number can be active at a SRAN and have a stock
        level or bench stock detail present, yet have no demands for the input SRD(s). In
        those cases, PCL01 treats the stock number as a new requirement and will build FIL
        and 1F3 transactions. If the FIL inputs reject the 1F3 load may not be necessary. To
        work this problem, process AMC program GVL43. See Section C for additional
        instructions. The GVL43 reads the PCL01 FIL/1F3 output file and deletes invalid
        FIL/1F3 inputs. It will also reformat the long FIL output by PCL01 to a short FIL
        when the stock number is present under a different system designator.
     2.2.8.11. Purpose: Describe how the output data is used by the PCL01 program to
     compute PDLs and produce the transactions for implementing the PDLs in the ILS-S.
     The PCL01 COBOL program reads the DISCOVERER output file. The PCL01
     identifies, using base weapon system details, potential NSNs to assign a proactive
     adjusted stock level or bench stock authorization at a particular SRAN. The PCL01
     program is downloadable from the AFMC Portal Site
        2.2.8.11.1. Candidate stock numbers must have at least one SRAN with a MIC of 1
        and must have positive Cumulative Recurring Demand (CRD) at that SRAN. The
        number of required bases with a positive demand is a program option. This is a good
72                                                   AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


     way to control the cost of loading proactive levels. As the number of required bases
     with a positive demand increases, the investment cost decreases. PCL01 will build
     data/work files that identify candidate items for proactive stocking for any SRAN.
     This SRAN does not have to be one used in the DISCOVERER query. Although this
     capability exists, it is an exception and not the norm. AFMC SCM-R may enter the
     output SRANS via file rather than keying in each SRAN individually. This option is
     activated by creating TXT file PCL01SRANS.TXT. Place the file in the PCL01
     folder. Records in the file must contain the SRAN in positions 1 – 4. The file can
     contain up to 200 SRAN records.
     2.2.8.11.2. The following actions will be performed:
        2.2.8.11.2.1. Open the      PC    folder PCL01.      Double click on the file
        PCL01CBL.exe.
        2.2.8.11.2.2. Click “continue” if the data is correct.
        2.2.8.11.2.3. Enter the range parameter, this is the number of SRANs that must
        have a positive cumulative recurring demand before a PDL will be generated.
        Click “continue” to proceed.
        2.2.8.11.2.4. The display of the next screen depends upon how the PCL01
        SRAN(S) is entered. If the SRAN(s) is input via the PCL01SRANS.TXT file,
        then go to Para 2.2.8.11.2.6, otherwise continue to Para 2.2.8.11.2.5
        2.2.8.11.2.5. Enter the SRAN(s) that requires proactive levels. Click “continue”
        to proceed. Click “add more SRANs” to continue entering SRANs.
        2.2.8.11.2.6. Review the SRANs input (manually or thru the PCL01SRANS.TXT
        file). Click “continue” to proceed. Click “re-enter SRAN data” to repeat the step.
        2.2.8.11.2.7. If changes are needed to the PCL01SRANS.TXT file, restart the
        PCL01 from the beginning.
        2.2.8.11.2.8. Click “continue” after viewing data on the next two screens.
        2.2.8.11.2.9. Click “Exit Program”.
        2.2.8.11.2.10. Output.
            2.2.8.11.2.10.1. PCL01OUT.TXT – This file is delimited and contains

                2.2.8.11.2.10.6. PCL01MAJ.TXT – Contains the estimated cost of proactive
                levels by MAJCOM. The actual cost is determined through the GVL43
                program (see Section C) in file AMC0*GVL43-VALUE.
     2.2.8.12. Purpose: Describe how the output files are tailored for input to the SBSS. Once
     the candidate list from PCL01 is reviewed, the GVL43 Program reads the PCL01 output
     files and provides the capability to validate the FIL/1F3 output and build FIL, 1F3, and
     FCD inputs for subsequent processing in the SBSS. It also provides a way to validate all
     inputs prior to processing in the SBSS (see Para 2.2.8.12.1). GVL43 program is
     downloadable from the AFMC Portal Site.
        2.2.8.12.1. The GVL43 program reads the FIL file output by PCL01. It checks to see
        if the stock number in the FIL transaction exists for the input system designator. If the
        stock number already exists, the FIL transaction is removed from the file. The
        program also checks to see if the stock number in the FIL is in the ILS-S for another
        system designator. If it is, the “long” FIL transaction is converted to a “short” FIL
        transaction format. Next, FCDs are built to change the SPC for all FIL inputs to a 4.
        For 1F3 transaction inputs, GVL43 checks for a FIL and whether the item record is
        loaded in the ILS-S. If the item record is not loaded and no FIL transaction has been
        generated for input, the 1F3 transaction is written to an error file (AMC0*GV-L43-
        ER1F3). An FCD transaction is created to change the SPC to 4 for any 1F3 input that
        has an item record with a SPC of 5. The 1F3 transaction is deleted if the stock number
        already has a demand level or bench stock authorization. Updated FIL and 1F3
        transaction files are output for processing in the SBSS.
        2.2.8.12.2. The following actions will be performed:
            2.2.8.12.2.1. The GVL43 program requires the following Executive Control
            Language (ECL), program absolute and support files. Ensure all files are on your
            system before starting the program.

AMC0*PCL01FIL (PCL01 outputs file PCL01FILXXXX.TXT (where XXXX equals the base
SRAN)).
AMC0*PCL011F3 (PCL01 outputs file PCL011F3XXXX.TXT (where XXXX equals the base
SRAN)).
Output files:

Note: For ILS-S processing: Process GVL43. Process the output FIL file. Then process the
GVL43 again to verify all the FIL inputs were successful. The FIL transaction file on the second
run should be empty. Next process the 1F3 file (from second run of GVL43). Process the GVL43
again (third time) to verify that all the 1F3 inputs ran correctly. Review the AMC0*GV-L43-
ER1F3 file and manually build a FIL transaction input to process these 1F3 inputs.

   2.2.9. Mission Change and New Activation Spares Support List Procedures and
   Transactions.
       2.2.9.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures and transactions used by the ILS-S to
       generate, load, and implement a Mission Change or New Activation Spares Support List
       (NASSL).
       2.2.9.2. The mission change detail effective date is the date when the mission change
       daily demand rates (MCDDR) and the mission change daily demand frequency rates
       (MCDDFR) begin being used by the requirements computation to affect item demand
       levels and requisition quantities. The load dates for mission change gains must be within
       9 days of data collection or consolidation to ensure the demand data are still valid.
       Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) Demand Data Input 1SD inputs that are older than
       9 days will reject.
       2.2.9.3. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will coordinate actions if
       the base will use the override routing identifier code (RID) during requisitioning to pass
       requisitions to the losing base at the time of 1SD load. Before the NASSL gaining base
       can use this option, the effective date must be past and the losing base must have loss
       detail records loaded. Requirements computation can then determine excesses that may
       be shipped to the gaining base. Depending upon the advice code used, requisitions that
       cannot be filled will be passed or killed by the losing base. Appropriate supply status
       will be provided.
           2.2.9.3.1. SRD-based Consumption Data Source Base and NASSL Gaining Base
           SRAN. If more than one base is used for source data, specify the base and SRAN
           that will consolidate the data using program R65/NGV910, SRD Demand Data
           Analysis and Consolidation.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               75


     2.2.9.4. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will manage all MCD
     transactional/coordination processes and establish a mission change document file that
     contains all correspondence on the mission change processing, R37/NGV853 (SRD
     Demand Data Analysis) listings processed to monitor the accuracy of SRD data, annual
     update option of A01/NGV849 (Standard Reporting Designator File) update which
     replaces all previous listings, along with input and output from processing programs
     NGV433 , Mission change special level detail load/change, (TRIC 1SDHDR) and
     NGV436, Mission Change, Detail Change, (TRIC 1XT). The A01/NGV849 will be
     processed using the update option to update the date of first demand and quantity on the
     SRD record at least annually.
     2.2.9.5. Mission Change/NASSL SRD-based Consumption Data Collection Process.
     SRD-based consumption data collection is accomplished by the D13/NGV833, Daily
     SRD Update Program, which automatically collects data for all type organization codes
     and SRDs, except Znn SRDs. At least 6 months of data are needed to calculate a realistic
     average daily demand rate on an item. If the date of first demand recorded on the SRD
     record is less than 180 days, then 180 days will be used in the computations of the daily
     demand rate.
     2.2.9.6. When notified, the AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will
     process the following:

            2.2.9.7.2.3. Create 216 Loss Details. The NASSL losing base processing of the
            1SD images results in the ILS-S creation of a Mission Change Special Level
            Detail Record (216 record) with a Type Level Flag equal to “H”.
     2.2.9.8. The ILS-S calculates mission change/NASSL gaining and losing base demand
     levels for items with mission change special levels using the recoverable and consumable
     item leveling techniques. However, the mission change item daily demand rates (DDRs)
     are adjusted upward or downward based upon the type level codes: type level code G
     indicates an increase, and type level code H a decrease. The resulting demand levels
     (influenced by the mission change daily demand rates loaded at the base) are stored on
     the item record. Type level codes G and H influence how the DDR is adjusted, as
     follows:
        2.2.9.8.1. If the mission change level contains a mission change percent base repair
        (PBR) (stored in tenths) in the duplicate detail flag field, the mission change PBR is
        used to compute levels under these conditions: 1) if data are available from less than
        one quarter's repair cycle, or 2) if a PBR override is not loaded on the mission change
        detail.
            2.2.9.8.1.1. If the mission change level contains a PBR override (stored in tenths)
            in the project code field, the override PBR is used to compute levels regardless of
            the 1) data on the repair cycle record, or 2) the mission change PBR stored on the
            mission change adjusted level.
        2.2.9.8.2. Three daily demand rate elements are computed by the releveling program
        and then stored on the Requirements Group Data Record and Requirements Group
        Data Extension Record. These DDR elements are calculated as follows:
        2.2.9.8.3. The net DDR for all mission change details for an item or group of items is
        determined according to its effective dates, as follows:
        2.2.9.8.3.1. Effective Date Less than Current Date. If the detail effective date is
        equal to or less than the current date, the net DDR is stored in the net balance of
        effective mission change details of the extension record. When the current date is
        less than the support date, the remaining days must equal 365 days.
            2.2.9.8.3.2. Storing the Net DDR. Regardless of the detail effective date, the net
            DDR is stored in the net balance of all mission change details field of the
            extension record. When the current date is less than the support date, the
            remaining days must equal 365 days.
            2.2.9.8.3.3. Standard DDR. The standard DDR is calculated by the ILS-S from
            recorded demand data.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 77


                 2.2.9.8.3.4. Summing DDRs. Finally, the system adds to the standard DDR the
                 mission change DDR. The sum of these two DDRs is then stored on the group
                 record. This sum is the DDR used by the ILS-S to calculate stock levels in
                 support of the mission change. The summed DDR is also used at the mission
                 change base/the NASSL gaining and losing bases in determining reportable
                 excesses and for initiating requisition cancellation requests.
        2.2.9.9. The ILS-S programmatically deletes mission change details when the mission
        support date exceeds the current date by 365 days.
   2.2.10. Program NGV547, NASSL, Requisition Upgrade Program.
        2.2.10.1. Program NGV547, NASSL, Requisition Upgrade Program, must be processed
        if requisitions must be upgraded for any reason. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for
        processing instructions.
        2.2.10.2. Purpose: To provide necessary indicative data and accumulated demand data
        for use by program NGV433 (Mission change special level detail load/change). These
        data, together with the mission-change-gain or loss-data record, will be used by program
        NGV433 to establish applicable mission change/NASSL special level detail records and,
        if required, item records.
        2.2.10.3. Must be input during in-line processing. Program NGV433 (TRIC 1SDHDR)
        must be processed before these inputs.
        2.2.10.4. . Output will be rejects and/or management notices, SNUD add (DIC BDFA),
        and requisitions, depending on options loaded by program NGV433.

Notes:
1. The RIC code (positions 4–6) and data (positions 7–57) are generated from the item
record and repair cycle record of the source base (base where data are collected).
2. This SRD daily demand rate (positions 75–79) is computed by the reports program from
the SRD demand data record or the source base item record, depending on the option
selected. Program R37/NGV853 uses the DDR formula. Program NGV710 computes the
DDR based on the selection options from the input parameter in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
Ch 6. The DDR consists of two whole numbers and three decimal positions (xx.xxx).
Special levels and additive levels are not considered as part of this computation.
3. This SRD daily demand frequency rate (positions 80-83) is computed by the reports
program from the source base item record. Program NGV710 computes the DDFR based on
the selection options from the input parameter in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6. The DDFR
consists of four decimal positions.
4. SRAN Where Data Collected (positions 84–87). This field is generated by the reports
program from the base constants-1 record at the base where data were collected or
consolidated.
5. Date Prepared (positions 88–92). This field is generated by the reports program when the
1SD data inputs are produced.
6. Base Factor (positions 93–95). This field is generated by the reports program from the
input parameter.
7. Standard Reporting Designator (positions 96–98). This field is generated by the reports
program from the input parameter and the SRD demand data record.
8. Mission Impact Code (position 72). This field is generated by the reports program based
on the contents of the MISSION-IMPACT-CODE field on the ITEM-RECORD. This code
has the same criteria as an SPC. Unlike the SPC, the Mission Impact Code applies to all
ERRCDs (not just XB3 items). The Mission Impact Code is never downgraded, and it is not
restricted to backorder items.
9. Bench Stock Flag (position 73). This field is generated by the reports program based on
the contents of the BENCH-STOCK-FLAG field on the ITEM-RECORD. Managers use this
code when deciding on whether to put that item on bench stock or not.
10. This field is generated by the reports program from the item record at the base where the
data was collected or consolidated.
11. The application and impact of SPCs depends upon whether the gaining base already has
the item record loaded when the 1SD is processed. Table 2.12. summarizes the scenarios
and impacts of 1SD SPC values. MAJCOMS may want to screen 1SDs for SPC E and
change them before input. If the item record already exists with an SPC E, gaining base
personnel should consider changing the item record SPC to allow requisitioning.

not take place even though the requisition action flag (position 30) is an R.
b. If the item record is already loaded and has a demand level established, requisition action may
occur. Enter the Ordinal date (format is YYDDD, for example, 89107). See Note 9.
5. Mission Support Effective Date. The mission support date must be equal to or greater than
the detail effective date. Increased or decreased support requirements are first expected on this
date. After this date (as normal demand data are accumulated), the effect of the detail DDR and
DDFR begins to decline.
6. System Designator. The system designator must be authorized. It will be used on all item
record and detail record loads.
7. Application Code. This application code may be blank or contain an alpha or numeric
character. If not blank, the code will be used on new item record loads only. This field will be
ignored when pos. 7 contains an H (loss).
8. Exception Codes. These fields (positions 25-28) may be blank. If they are not blank, the
exception phrase record must be loaded. These codes will be loaded to all input item records.
(This code will be on the mission change data record for use by the TRIC 1SD load. Ensure the
exception code/s are loaded prior to processing 1SDs.)
9. Requisition Action Flag. This field may be blank. If not, it must contain an R to indicate
requisitioning when the mission change special level detail record is loaded. The field and
positions 31-53 will be ignored under these conditions:
a. The input type level code (position 7) is H (loss)
b. When the detail record is loaded, the level detail effective date (positions 11-15) is greater
than the current processing date. Also see Note 4.
10. Media and Status Code. This field cannot be blank if position 30 contains an R; it must
contain an authorized code as stated in DLM 4000.25-1-M, Military Standard Requisitioning and
Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP). This code will be output on all requisitions.
11. Supplementary Address. This field may be blank, contain a valid supplementary address, or
contain an alpha or numeric date significant to the requisitioner (if preceded by a Y in position
32). This supplementary address will be output on all requisitions. Assignment of a valid
supplementary address (for example, FBxxxx) will affect signal code assignment.
12. Advice Code. This field may be blank. If not, it must contain 2C, 2G, 2H, 2W, 6C, or 6X.
The advice code will be output on all requisitions.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    83


13. Requisition Priority Designator. This field cannot be blank if position 30 contains an R; it
must contain numbers 01 through 15. The requisition priority designator will be output on all
requisitions.
14. Required Delivery Date. This field may be blank. If not, it must contain only numbers and
be greater than all zeros. For NASSL loads, when the required delivery date field contains 999,
XO3 is moved to the RDD field of outgoing requisitions. When the required delivery date field
is 999, the application field must contain a NASSL serial number. (See Note 20 below.)
15. Project Code. This field may be blank. If not, it must contain an authorized project code as
listed in https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=MC-LG-02-
63-24&Filter=MC-LG-02-63 When assigned, the project code will be output on all requisitions.
16. Requisition Override System Designator. This field may be blank. If not, it must contain
01, Al-A9, B0-B9, or C0-C9. The requisition override system designator will be output on all
requisitions.
17. Requisition Override Routing Identifier Code. This field may be blank. If the field is not
blank, the routing identifier record must be loaded. This routing identifier code will be output on
all requisitions.
18. SRAN Where Data Collected. This field must contain the SRAN of the base where the 1SD
data was collected or consolidated. This field must contain numbers only. During processing of
the 1SD data inputs, the SRAN in positions 68-71 must be equal to this SRAN. If position 7
equals an H (loss), this SRAN must be equal to the SRAN loaded for the system designator
entered in positions 21-22 of the program select format.
19. Application. This field cannot be blank; it must identify the command letter, program action
document, or message that authorized use or load of the mission change levels. Pos. 58 must
contain either an (n) M (message), L (letter) or P (program action document). Pos. 58-67 must
be structured in one of the following ways (see Note 20 below for NASSL level loads):
a. If position 58 equals M (message), positions 59-64 must contain all numbers to show the date
and time group of the message. Position 65 must contain a letter from A-L to denote the month
(A = Jan, B = Feb, etc.); and positions 66-67 must contain the last two positions of the year. For
example: if the AETC message number 261800Z Dec 93 was the authorizing document,
positions 58-67 should contain M261800L93.
b. If position 58 equals L (letter) or P (program action document), positions 59-61 must contain
letters to show the command or office symbol, and positions 62-67 must contain numbers to
show the date, month, and year. For example, if AMC/A4 letter dated 26 Dec 93 was the
authorizing document, positions 58-67 should contain LAMC261293.
20. The following information applies:
a. For NASSL level loads, position 58 must equal N (NASSL), positions 59-66 must contain a
NASSL serial number, and position 67 must be blank. The NASSL serial number is formatted as
follows: TYPE NASSL - 2 positions numeric; MAJCOM CODE - 1st position alphanumeric,
2nd position numeric; SERIAL NUMBER - 4 positions numeric.
b. During inline processing (TRIC 1SD), the constant NSSL and the serial number is moved to
the DUO-DOCUMENT-NUMBER field on the due-in detail record. The four-position SRAN-
WHERE-DATA-COLLECTED, the constant N, and the eight-position serial number are moved
to the application field on the adjusted stock level detail.
21. Suppress SNUD Add Flag. This field may be blank or contain an S. (An S will suppress
output of SNUD add (BDFA) on new item loads during the inline processing of the 1SD data
inputs.)
 84                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


22. Percent of Base Repair Override. This field may be blank, contain an A or 0-9. Leave it
blank if override of the computed percent of base repair is not desired. Enter zero to indicate
zero percent of base repair, one to indicate ten percent, etc. Enter an A for 100 percent base
repair capability.
23. Factor Computations Flag. This field must be blank or contain a Y.
a. If the field is blank, then transaction history records (TTPC 4D) created during inline
processing of the 1SD data inputs will show the program factor (percent of effect the new detail
had on the level) only on marginal ALS reportable items (report code 6 or 7).
b. If the field contains a Y, then all transaction history records (TTPC 4D) will show the
program factor. The inline processing time will significantly increase because of the additional
interfaces with the requirements computation program.
24. If the Requisition Action Flag field contains an R, then the Factor Computations Flag field
(position 78) must contain a Y.
25. First/Next Standard Reporting Designator. This field must contain a valid SRD that is
loaded to the standard equate designator record. For procedures and definition of the standard
equate designator record, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 8.
26. Change Factor. This field must contain only numbers greater than zero, and will contain the
change factor (no decimal positions).
27. Additional SRD or Change Factor Fields. These fields consist of 18 additional SRD or
change factor fields and must be in the same format as instructed for positions 81-86.
28. A maximum of 19 SRDs and their respective change factors may be loaded and processed.
If 19 SRDs are not used, then the last three positions must be three asterisks (***).
   2.2.12. Program NGV436 (Change Mission Change Details).
        2.2.12.1. Purpose. To call program NGV436 (Change Mission Change Details and/or
        Flag Item Record for Releveling) to change special level detail records meeting the
        selection criteria with the data entered in the program select and parameter images. To
        flag the applicable item records for releveling when position 69 contains an R.
        2.2.12.2. Input Restrictions. RPS/main system. Must be input in twilight after the END
        input has been processed and prior to any report (RPT) processing. A complete IRU
        dump must be taken before processing this program. The IRU dump must be reloaded if
        program abnormally terminates for any reason.
        2.2.12.3. Outputs. REJ 001 - Input columns with X below are invalid. Correct invalid
        condition and reinput. REJ 201 - NO CHANGE-TO DATA ON SELECT CARD.
        Correct the program select image and reinput if necessary. MGT 217 - NO DETAILS
        OR ITEM RECORDS UPDATED. After the ITMDTL-AREA has been scanned, if no
        detail records meeting the program select format criteria were found or the change-to data
        already equaled the detail record data, this management notice is generated.

Notes:
1. First/Next SRD. This field must contain a valid SRD that is loaded to the standard
equate designator record. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 8, for procedures and
definition. When parameters are input, the detail record's SRD must be equal to one of
the input SRDs. If the SRDs are not equal, the detail or detail's item record will not be
selected.
2. Multiplier. This field cannot be blank and must contain only numbers. It consists of a
one-position whole number and two decimal positions (decimal point assumed X.XX).
This field is used to increase or decrease the detail records DDR and DDFR (for example,
to increase the applicable detail record's DDR and DDFR by 50 percent, enter 150 and the
program will multiply the detail record's DDR and DDFR by 1.50; to decrease the detail
record DDR and DDFR by 10 percent, enter 010).
a. If selecting specific detail records by SRD and the detail record's DDR and DDFR are
not to be changed, enter all zeros (000) in the applicable multiplier field.
b. If position 69 of the program select image equals R, this field must contain all zeros
(000).
3. Additional SRD or Multipliers. Positions 7-78 consist of twelve additional SRD or
multiplier fields and must be in the same format as instructed for positions 1-6 (Notes 1
and 2 above).
4. A maximum of 39 SRDs and their respective multipliers may be selected by entering
up to three parameter inputs.
a. If the maximum (39 SRDs = 3 parameters) is not selected, the three positions
immediately following the last multiplier must contain three asterisks (***) to denote the
end of the SRDs and multipliers.
b. If the number of SRDs and multipliers fills a parameter but is not equal to 39, (one or
two parameter inputs), the parameter input must be followed by another input containing
three asterisks (***) in positions 1-3.


  2.2.13. TRIC DMC (Mission Change Detail Delete).
      2.2.13.1. Purpose: To explain the selective deletion of mission change/NASSL details
      procedures process. TRIC DMC (Mission Change Detail Delete) changes the detail
      mission support date to the current Julian date minus 366. TRIC DMC does not actually
      delete the detail, it merely prepares the detail for deletion by TRIC LVL; that is, and the
      detail will not actually be deleted until requirements computation (releveling) has been
      performed.
      2.2.13.2. Input Restrictions.   May be input at any terminal based upon the user-
      ID/password.
      2.2.13.3. Output. No output is produced if the input processes successfully. The
      following rejects apply: 074, 097, 155, 158, 179, 295, 775, and 799. See AFH 23-123,
      Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for reject explanations.

Notes:
1. Duplicate Detail Override Flag. Use an asterisk to establish multiple ASL records and
override REJ 072. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for more information on REJ 072 and the
edits performed on ASL record loads.
2. Stock Number. Adjusted Stock Levels may not be loaded to adjunct stock numbers (dash (-)
stock numbers) other than -1 numbers.

3. Input Level Quantity. This field must contain numbers greater than zero; except for
maximum levels, which may be all zeros. Quantity for bench stock items cannot exceed three
times the authorized quantity on the master bench stock detail. A 156 reject notice will occur if
the application field of the 1F3 input has a master bench stock detail, and the amount authorized
is exceeded by three times. If it is required to process a 1F3 against multiple bench stock details
on a stock number, see the application data requirements described in Para. 2.2.26.
4. Organization Code. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for details.
a. When processing a Base/AFMC SCM-R initiated ASL, use the organization code of the
activity requiring the level.
b. When processing a predetermined ASL request use organization code 007 for the B and E
accounts.
c. When processing a level for a bench stock item, use the organization code from the activity
requiring the level. If a level is established to support multiple master bench stock details that
are loaded against one stock number, use organization/shop code 007SC. See AFMAN 23-122,
Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning for more information on loading ASLs to support bench stock
authorizations.
5. Shop Code. Use the shop code of the activity requesting the level if the request is base-
initiated. Use shop code SC for directed levels applicable to B and E accounts. When
processing a level for a bench stock item, use the shop code from the activity requiring the level.
6. Application Data. This field has preset formats that contain the reason and application data
(e.g., bench stock/regulation) for ASL record loads. See Para. 2.2.26. for the application data
format.
7. Reason Why Code. See the format for the appropriate RWC (Para 2.2.27.).
8. Standard Reporting Designator. Enter an authorized SRD. If none exists for the end item,
enter the SRD for the next higher assembly. This field must contain a valid SRD for wholesale-
contractor managed assets. For the rare occurrence no SRD applies, enter ZZZ.
9. Project Code. The project code further identifies the reason for the ASL record and may be
used to augment support for a particular project. See
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=MC-LG-02-63-
24&Filter=MC-LG-02-63 for authorized project codes.
10. Type Level Flag. This entry must be compatible with positions 68 and 69. If the input
creates an invalid file condition, program control underlines the applicable fields with Xs and
outputs REJ 001. See Para. 2.2.16 for more information on Type Level Flag.
11. Level Justification Code. See the format for the appropriate LJC (Para. 2.2.28.). This code
must be compatible with the entries in positions 66 and 69. If the input creates an invalid record
condition, program control underlines the appropriate fields with Xs and outputs REJ 001.
12. Approval Flag. See the format for approval flag in Para. 2.2.29. This code must be
compatible with the entries in positions 66 and 68. If the input creates an invalid record
condition, program control underlines the applicable fields with Xs and outputs REJ 001.
13. Major Command Code. For a base-initiated request, enter the MAJCOM code of the
organization. For a command directed level enter the MAJCOM code of the organization
requiring the level. The MAJCOM code is not used for HQ AFMC (ICP), wholesale-contractor,
or HQ USAF directed levels.
14. Approval Date. If the approval date is left blank a memo ASL record will be established.

        2.2.16.1. Purpose: To provide the transactions used in the ILS-S to change ASLs This
        input does not affect the approval/validation and review/established dates.
           2.2.16.1.1. The 1F3 Change Input. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity may
           process 1F3 change inputs to update the quantity, application, sustainment flag,
           reason why code, SRD, project code, level directed by, major command, LJC,
           approval flag, shop repair capability, type level flag, or fixed level variable factor on
           ASL detail records. The input change data are subject to the same edit criteria as
           ASL loads.
           2.2.16.1.2. Changing Established ASL Quantities. Establishing higher quantities on
           established ASL detail records may be accomplished by preparing a new ASL request
           for the higher quantity. Once received, process an ASL load (1F3L) transaction to
           establish a memo ASL detail record in the system. Remember, the system will not
           allow establishment of a “duplicate” ASL for the same item or within the same group
           of items for any particular organization so you will process the new ASL with the
           higher quantity load transaction using a Duplicate Detail Override Flag (DDOF). The
           DDOF performs two important functions: (1) it allows the loading of the new or
           greater quantity ASL as memo, and; (2) it allows the old or lesser quantity ASL to
           support established customer requirements. If the quantity increase is approved, you
           will delete the old firm ASL(s) for the lesser quantity and firm up the new ASL with
           the higher quantity with an ASL approval date transaction (1F3A). See Para. 2.2.18
           for more information on the approval date. If the request for an increase in the ASL
           is not approved, you will delete the memo ASL detail record with an ASL delete
           transaction (1F3D). See Para 2.2.12 for more information on deleting ASL records.

  2.2.21. Guide To Assigning The Type Level Flag (TLF).
        2.2.21.1. Purpose: To define the different types of ASLs and the criteria and guidelines
        for assigning type level flags to the ILS-S ASL detail records.
        2.2.21.2. Types of Adjusted Stock Levels. There are three different types of Adjusted
        Stock Levels available in the ILS-S: minimum; maximum; and fixed. The following
        paragraphs describe the different types and common usages of ASLs in the ILS-S,
        distinguished by the Type Level Flag (TLF).
           2.2.21.2.1. Minimum Levels. A minimum ASL is one of the more common types of
           ASL used in the ILS-S and is defined as the minimum quantity of an item required to
           be available to support operations--regardless of demand activity. In other words, use
           minimum-type ASLs when the requirement dictates “no less than” a specified amount
           of stock (stockage floor) available to satisfy requirements. The following paragraphs
           provide a brief description of the three different types of minimum ASLs available for
           use.
                2.2.21.2.1.1. Minimum Level - Type Level Flag A. Type A minimum levels do
                not initiate stock replenishment action every time the stock balance is reduced. In
                fact, the inventory position must drop below one-third of the minimum level
                quantity before the system initiates stock replenishment. In general terms, the
                inventory position is the amount of base stock on hand and/or on order to support
                requirements. Additionally, the ILS-S automatically deletes type A minimum
                levels when the computed demand-based stock level (Item Record Demand Level,
                COLT or RBL computed) equals or exceeds the ASL quantity. NOTE: Can be
                used only with Level of Approval Flag B--Temporary. See Para 2.2.15 for
                minimum level load instructions.
                2.2.21.2.1.2. Minimum Level - Type Level Flag B. Type B minimum levels
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  101


             function identically to type level flag A minimum levels with one important
             difference--the system initiates stock replenishment when the inventory position
             drops to one less than the minimum level quantity. Therefore, before establishing
             type B minimum levels, the customer or materiel management personnel should
             justify why the one-third replenish methodology will not support operational
             requirements. NOTE: Can be used only with Level of Approval Flag B--
             Temporary. See Para.2.2.15 for load instructions.
             2.2.21.2.1.3. Minimum Level - Type Level Flag C. Type C minimum levels also
             use a one-less stock replenishment methodology. The distinguishing feature of
             type C minimum levels is that the system will not automatically delete the ASL
             record but will place the level in a Memo status when the computed demand-
             based stock level equals or exceeds the minimum level quantity. Therefore, use
             type level C minimum levels when you expect the computed demand-based stock
             level to fluctuate above or below the minimum level quantity. NOTE: Can be
             used only with Level of Approval Flag A--Directed or C--Permanent. See Para
             2.2.15 for load instructions.
          2.2.21.2.2. Maximum Levels. Maximum levels (stockage ceiling) are used to restrict
          stockage. Examples of when to use maximum levels include projected base phase-
          downs and limited storage capacity. Maximum-type ASLs will not begin to restrict
          stockage until the computed demand-based stock level exceeds the maximum level
          quantity. Maximum type levels are identified in the ILS-S with Type Level Flag D.
          NOTE: Can be used with any Level of Approval Flag. See Para 2.2.10 for load
          instructions
          2.2.21.2.3. Fixed Levels. Fixed ASLs maintain a constant quantity of an item to
          meet mission requirements. Therefore, the quantity specified on a fixed level may be
          determined without regard to any established demand history. Another distinguishing
          feature of the fixed-type level is that the ILS-S treats this level as controlling stock
          level (in the absence of COLT or RBL) when established on an individual item or
          group of items. To enforce this control, the ILS-S performs edits on items before the
          establishment of fixed or other multiple ASLs. The reorder point for fixed ASLs is
          normally one less than the fixed level quantity. However, fixed ASL reorder points
          may be adjusted using a Variable Reorder Factor (VRF). Fixed levels are identified
          in the ILS-S with Type Level Flag E. Note: Can be used with any Level of Approval
          Flag. See Para 2.2.10 for load instructions.
          2.2.21.2.4. The following Guide indicated in Table 2.24 will be used to assign Type
          Level Flags.

           2.2.21.2.4.1. Selecting the Appropriate Type Level Flag.
               2.2.21.2.4.1.1. Determine from the level justification the minimum,
               maximum, or fixed level required (column I). There is only one type level
               flag in column E applicable to a maximum level (D) and one to a fixed level
               (E). If a minimum level is required, continue to the next step.
               2.2.21.2.4.1.2. Determine (Column II) whether or not the detail record can be
               deleted if the demand level exceeds the total minimum level quantity. The
               ILS-S automatically deletes the detail record for Type Level Flags “A and B”.
               2.2.21.2.4.1.3. Determine (Column III) whether or not the detail record is
               considered Permanent or Temporary. The ILS-S automatically deletes
               Temporary Levels upon the previously negotiated expiration date. For
               example, a Weapon System Modification needing three years to complete
               would have an expiration date three years from the date of approval and
               would automatically delete upon reaching expiration date.
               2.2.21.2.4.1.4. Determine (Column IV) if the reorder point must be one less
               than the adjusted level quantity or if one third of the minimum level is
               sufficient. Note: This decision affects the number of stock requisitions that
               must be submitted in order to maintain adequate stock. If a reorder point of
               one less than the minimum level is used, stock requisitioning will be on a one-
               for-one basis each time a non-repair cycle item is issued or each time a repair
               cycle asset is shipped or condemned. Ordinarily, if one-third of the minimum
               level quantity satisfies the expected demand during the order and shipping
               time, then use the one-third reorder point.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               103


                2.2.21.2.4.1.5. Select (Column V) the type level flag as required by the
                determinations noted above.
                2.2.21.2.4.1.6. Additional Processing Consideration for Maximum Levels -
                Type Level Flag D. Even though storage restrictions drive most maximum
                ASL applications, the following business rules must be considered before
                maximum ASLs are established.
                2.2.21.2.4.1.7. Interchangeable and Substitute Groups. Maximum ASLs are
                restricted to one level per each master and interchangeable relationship or
                bachelor items. The system rejects any attempt to establish a maximum ASL
                when one already exists for that same or group of items.
                2.2.21.2.4.1.8. Additional Processing Consideration for Fixed Levels - Type
                Level Flag E.
                2.2.21.2.4.1.9. Identical to maximum levels, fixed ASLs are also restricted to
                one per ISG or bachelor item. Consider that if a minimum (no less) or
                maximum (no more) ASL requirement has already been established in the
                ILS-S for the item, loading a fixed level by definition (no more or less)
                contradicts the other type ASLs. Fixed levels are considered the controlling
                stock level (in the absence of an RBL level) in the ILS-S. Corrective action
                in this situation would encompass deleting the minimum and maximum ASLs,
                adjusting the fixed level quantity accordingly to capture support for all
                requirements, and reprocessing the fixed level load input. See Para 2.2.15 for
                establishment details.
         2.2.21.2.5. Variable Reorder Factor (VRF). Normally, the reorder point for a fixed
         level is set to one less than the fixed level quantity. However, when a fixed level is
         established or updated in the ILS-S, an external decision can be made to set a
         different reorder point by specifying a variable reorder factor (VRF). The VRF can
         be set to any decimal factor between .1 and .9 and will reduce the item reorder point
         (ROP) accordingly. See Figure 2.5

   2.2.23. Adjusted Stock Level Load, Change, Delete Transaction (XE4).
        2.2.23.1. Purpose: To produce an output transaction (XE4) for each firm minimum,
        maximum, and fixed ASL detail record containing type level flags A, B, C, D, or E. The
        ILS-S produces a XE4 transaction as a result of a 1F3 add, change, or delete transaction
        for a recoverable-type item.
        2.2.23.2. The XE4 load (ASL transaction code L) notification is sent to the wholesale
        D035E RBL system. If the ASL is base-initiated, D035E will compare the XE4 to the
        RBL database. If the XE4 and the RBL database match, an ASL confirmation
        notification (XE6) will be returned to the reporting base. If the XE4 and the RBL
        database do not match, an ASL Reject Notification (XE5) with XE4 reject code “R” will
        be returned to the reporting base. XE4 change (ASL transaction code C) notifications are
        produced for each firm level whenever the level directed by code, ASL quantity, and/or
        validation date is changed. XE4 delete (ASL Transaction Code D) notifications are
        produced when firm levels are deleted or changed to memo.

Notes:
1. Adjusted Stock Level Transaction Codes. See Table 2.33. for appropriate
assignment.
2. Type Level Flag. Type level flags A, B, and C will always have type level flag A in
this field.
3. The demand level and net adjustment fields will be constant 00000.
4. Adjusted Stock Level Quantity. The Adjusted Stock Level quantity will be the ASL
quantity or the CHPMSK (234) detail quantity.
5. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code. Leave Blank if desired. TEX Code “I” in this
field means that an XCA was received without a Reduced Level Flag of “S” in position
7 and an RBL quantity less than the approved minimum level(s) loaded in the ILS-S.
The XE4 is transmitted with an “I” in position 67 to notify the central leveling system
of the minimum level(s) loaded at the base so the central leveling system will
recompute the RBL level.6. The XE4 output will include a CHPMSK flag from the
234 CHPMSK detail loaded for a recoverable item.
7. Approval/Operational Date. This field will show the operational date for full
complement of end article (ISSL), date of approval, or current Julian date for ASL
deletes.


   2.2.24. Adjusted Stock Level Reject Notification For HQ AFMC-Managed Items
   (XE5).
        2.2.24.1. Purpose: To inform a base-level activity that an ASL report transaction (XE4)
        cannot be accepted by the AFMC RBL (D035E) system because of an error condition.
        2.2.24.2. Correct error conditions identified by reject codes. For reject conditions that
        require modification to the ILS-S ASL detail record, make any modifications necessary
        with 1F3(x) transactions. Processing of 1F3 transactions will create new ASL report
        (XE4) transactions as applicable. If modifications to the ASL detail record are not
        required, Stock Control will change positions 1-3 to XE4, blank position 67, correct the
        error condition, and forward the corrected transaction to DLATS. Note: Destroy XE5
        rejects received for equipment items (positions 68-69 FE), as no further action is required
        for these rejects.

   2.2.26. Guidelines For Assigning Application Source Data
       2.2.26.1. Purpose: To provide instructions and guidelines for documenting directive
       source data on ILS-S ASL detail records.
       2.2.26.2. Loading and Changing Application Source Data. The application source data
       justification for the load of an ASL detail record is entered in positions 44-50 of ASL
       load input transactions. These data are entered in change inputs if a change to the data
       already loaded is desired.
       2.2.26.3. Level Directed by Code. The application source data are determined by the
       level directed by code (A – AFMC, B – Base, C – MAJCOM, D – HQ USAF).
          2.2.26.3.1. If the level directed by code is B (base-initiated), enter the Technical
          Order (TO), Figure, and Index, or other identifying data which denotes the end item
          application.
          2.2.26.3.2. If the level directed by code is A (HQ AFMC), C (MAJCOM), or D (HQ
          USAF), use Table 2.28 to enter the application source data indicating the need for the
          ASL.

Table 2.28. Application Source.
 ASL Directive
   Source                             ASL Load Input Instructions
Bench Stock        - For ASLs loaded to support a single bench stock, enter B in position
(B)                44 of the ASL load transaction.

Regulation (R)     or “R” (if regulation) in position 44 of the ASL load transaction,
                   followed by the manual number in positions 45-50. For example, if
                   the directive source is AFMAN 23-122, enter “M” in position 44
                   and “23122” in positions 45-49.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 111


Letter/email (L)   - For ASLs directed by Letter, enter “L” in position 44 of the ASL
or                 load transaction; for ASLs directed by a Message, enter “T” in
Message (T)        position 44 of the ASL load transaction.
                   - Enter the office address symbol of the message or letter originator
                   in positions 45-50 of the ASL load transaction or other applicable data
                   as needed.
                   - Enter the message number in positions 45-50 of the ASL load
                   transaction or other applicable data as needed.
   2.2.27. Guidelines for Assigning the Reason Why Code (RWC)
       2.2.27.1. Purpose: To provide guidelines for assigning reason why codes on ILS-S ASL
       records. The assignment of this code is determined by the reason or justification which
       warrants establishment of the adjusted level. Assign the code which most accurately
       describes the level requirement. The RWC may also be used to retain weapon system
       assets under the Life of Systems Stock (LSS) support concept.

   2.2.28. Guidelines for Assigning the Level Justification Code (ljc)
       2.2.28.1. Purpose: To provide guidelines for assigning level justification codes on ILS-S
       ASL records. The assignment of this code is determined by the reason or justification
       which warrants establishment of the adjusted level. Assign the code which most
       accurately describes the level requirement. The LJC may also be used to retain weapon
       system assets under the Life of Systems Stock (LSS) support concept.

Table 2.30. Level Justification Code.

      support both a deployment and normal base missions. LJC M may
      be assigned only to HQ AFMC managed items with ERRCD XD*.
  N   FAD IV and V units may negotiate for adjusted levels other than        Note 2
      LJC 0 through J or P through U only if stocks are required in
      support of higher priority missions (FAD I - III) and fall under the
      provisions of LJC K, L, or M. Under these circumstances, assign
      LJC N. LJC N may be assigned only to HQ AFMC managed items
      with ERRCD XD*.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 115


   P       Spares peculiar to systems operated by a single command and
           deployed to a limited number of locations. Under these
           circumstances, the operating command and SM/MM may jointly
           decide that deployment of spares to the principal operating
           locations is the most effective method of providing support.
           Adjusted levels may be negotiated by the base and the SM/MM as
           necessary to implement such a decision. These negotiated levels
           will be assigned LJC P. LJC P may be assigned with ERRCD,
           XD*, XF3, or XB3.
   R       Negotiation of adjusted levels not authorized by any other LJC
           requires specific approval by AF/A4LM. Only HQ AFMC
           managed items having ERRCD XD* are covered by this
           paragraph. Requests for the authority to negotiate as provided by
           LJC R are forwarded through HQ AFMC for review and comment
           prior to consideration by HQ USAF. HQ USAF approval
           authorizes negotiation only. It does NOT grant the authority to
           stock specific items or quantities. As a minimum, the requests for
           the authority to negotiate must indicate the mission, condition, and
           situation to be supported, the approximate number of items and
           estimated dollar value for which negotiated levels will be
           requested. LJC R may be assigned to HQ AFMC managed items
           with ERRCD XD*.
   S       Base/AFMC SCM-R initiated adjusted levels for ERRCD XD*
           which do not affect the stock level, as when a minimum level is
           less than the demand level. The level of approval code is always B;
           the type of adjusted level code is always C. LJC S may be assigned
           only to HQ AFMC managed items with ERRCD XD*.
   T       ISSL adjusted levels which will become Life of Systems Stock
           (LSS). LJC T may be assigned with any ERRCD.
   U       Bare Base Support Items. LJC U may be assigned with any
           ERRCD.
   V       Mission support kits to support recurring exercises and
           deployments of a unit not authorized a MRSP. LJC V may be
           assigned with any ERRCD.
Notes:
1. The adjusted level detail must always be memo.
2. LJC codes K through N can be assigned only when no other LJC applies.
   2.2.29. Guidelines for Assigning the Approval Flag
        2.2.29.1. Purpose: To provide guidelines for assigning approval flag on ILS-S ASL
        records. The flag identifies the appropriate level of approval required for ASL requests.

   2.2.32. Stockage Priority Codes (SPC).
       2.2.32.1. Purpose. The ILS-S programmatically assigns SPCs to consumable items
       (ERRCD XB3). The ILS-S requirements program uses SPCs to help determine when the
       items should be stocked for future use. SPCs are also used to prevent item stockage
       (preclude creating a demand level). Additionally, SPCs are used in conjunction with SPC
       subgroup codes (see Table 2.73) to help prioritize unfunded requirements via the
       production of Funds Requirements Cards (FRC).
       2.2.32.2. Assigning SPCs. SPC codes are categorized into groups: 1-5, A-E, J-N, and /
       (slash), S, T, U. When the SPC codes are assigned or changed, the ILS-S
       programmatically changes the 101-DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED to reflect the current date.
       The ILS-S assigns SPCs to consumable item records as detailed below. Table 2.35
       summarizes the SPC assignment rules.

         2.2.32.2.1. SPC 1-5. SPC codes 1-5 may be changed with FCD inputs. However,
         these codes are normally assigned to consumable item records as follows:
         2.2.32.2.2. SPC 1 – 4. SPC codes 1-4 are assigned to EOQ items when due-outs are
         established. The UJC assigned to the input determines which SPC code is assigned to
         the EOQ item record.
         2.2.32.2.3. SPC 5. SPC code 5 is assigned to new EOQ items when they are loaded.
         2.2.32.2.4. ISG Items. When consumable items are I&S grouped, the Master item in
         the group is assigned the highest SPC from among all items within the group.
         2.2.32.2.5. SPC 0. An SPC of zero (0) is assigned to items when the first customer
         backorder for the item has a MICAP (regardless of budget code) or UJC AR (budget
         code 8 only) priority. This identifies to the releveling program that a demand level
         needs to be computed. Once the demand level is established, the item SPC is
         changed to 1.
      2.2.32.3. Updating SPCs. Depending on the 101-DATE-OF-LAST-DEMAND of an
      item, SPCs are programmatically upgraded or downgraded as follows:
         2.2.32.3.1. SPCs 1 – 3. SPCs 1-3 are downgraded by 1 when file status is completed
         on an item record, and there is no customer demand over the previous 90 days. For
         instance, an item with an SPC of 1 is downgraded to SPC 2 if, after 90 days since the
         101-DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED, no additional customer demands have occurred for the
         item.
         2.2.32.3.2. SPC 4. SPC 4 is downgraded to 5 when file status is completed on an
         item record, and more than 180 days have passed since the last customer demand.
         2.2.32.3.3. SPC 1 – 4 Without Backorders. For SPC 1-4, if there is a demand (but no
         backorder) the SPC remains as currently assigned. If the item is backordered, the
         SPC can be upgraded depending on the UJC of the due out. Item SPCs can be
         manually changed via an FCD input.
      2.2.32.4. Non-Numeric SPCs.
         2.2.32.4.1. SPCs A – E. SPC codes A-E are equated to codes 1-5 for programmed
         decisions. Codes A-E must be assigned by Stock Control and changed with FCD
         inputs. SPCs A-E are not programmatically upgraded or downgraded.
            2.2.32.4.1.1. SPC E. SPC E is used to prevent automatic stock replenishment
            requisitioning action for EOQ items which cannot or should not be stocked.
            2.2.32.4.1.2. Non NSN Items. When a demand level is first computed for a non-
            NSN consumable item, an SPC E is automatically assigned by the releveling
            program. If local management wants to begin stocking the item, the SPC code
            should be changed to equal the current value of the item 101-MISSION-
            IMPACT-CODE.
            2.2.32.4.1.3. SPC E for Equipment Items. SPC E can be manually assigned to
            equipment items to exclude them from the normal automatic due-out release
            sequence. To remove an SPC E from an equipment item, process an FCD and
            change the code to a 5.
      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 121


                    2.2.32.4.2. SPCs J-N. SPC codes J-N are equated to codes 1-5 for program
                    decisions. Codes J-N must be assigned by Stock Control with FCD inputs. When
                    these codes are assigned, MACR restrictions are bypassed, except for annual orders
                    authorized. MACR factoring of requisitions will apply. FRCs are not produced.
                    Depending on the DOLD of an item, SPC codes J-N are up- or downgraded as
                    follows:
                       2.2.32.4.2.1. SPC J – L Downgrades. Codes J-L are downgraded by 1 during file
                       status if an item has not had a demand for 90 days.
                       2.2.32.4.2.2. SPC M Downgrade. Code M is downgraded to N if an item has not
                       had a demand for 180 days.
                       2.2.32.4.2.3. SPC N Upgrade. Code N is upgraded to M if the DOLD is less than
                       180 days, and the current number of demands is greater than zero.
                    2.2.32.4.3. SPC / (slash) S, T, and U. SPC codes /, S, T, U are equated to SPCs A-D
                    for programmed decisions. Codes /, S, T, U must be assigned by and changed by
                    Stock Control with FCD inputs. These SPCs are not upgraded or downgraded (as
                    outlined above). When codes /, S, T, U are assigned, MACR restrictions are
                    bypassed, except for annual orders authorized. MACR factoring of requisitions will
                    apply, but FRCs are not produced.
             2.2.32.5. Review of SPCs. SPC A-E, J-N, and /, S, T, and U identify EOQ item records
             that must be reviewed quarterly. Stock Control must run a local query program or an as-
             required report (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6) to select and list the EOQ item records
             for review. Stock Control must file the listing after it has been reviewed. Keep the
             listing on file until the next quarterly review is made.
             2.2.32.6. Summary of SPC Characteristics. Table 2.36               summarizes the SPC
             characteristics detailed in the previous paragraphs.

Notes:
1. ECC Request. Enter an E whenever an ECC image is desired; otherwise, leave blank. Any
other character in this field will be ignored.
2. Inquiry Indicator. Enter an I, a stock number, and system designator on screen FCD/149.
The FCD screen is required to process this option. The screen will fill with all current stock
control data that is loaded on the item record.
3. Force Code. Enter an F to override exception codes already on the item record; otherwise,
leave blank. Do not use the force code unless the initiator has already coordinated the change
with the responsible exception code monitor. If input is made to enter an exception code on an
item record and another code already exists, a management notice will be printed to reflect the
existing code.
4. NPPC. Enter the NPPC to be loaded to the item record or an asterisk (*) to blank existing
codes. When the NPPC is a 4 and the ISG source code is an alpha (for example, A4), the
asterisk (*) option cannot be used to blank the NPPC code.
5. Supply Point Flag. Enter a P to load the supply point flag or leave blank if no change is
required.
6. Multiple DIFM Flag. Enter a D to load the multiple DIFM flag. The Combat Operations
Support Flight is responsible for the multiple DIFM flag.
7. Functional Check Flag. To load a functional check flag to an item record, enter an F (process
an FRR to load a repair shop, if one is not already loaded). Inspection is responsible for loading
and deleting functional check flag and suspect materiel flags.
8. C-factor. See Para. 2.2.34.
9. Stockage Priority Code. When changing item records in the B account (type stock record
account B), take the following action:
a. For repair cycle items (ERRCD XD*/XF3), this field does not apply. Maintenance priority
codes are assigned and updated under program control.
b. For EOQ items (ERRCD XB3), this field contains the stockage priority code (codes 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, A, B, C, D, or E). If any other code is input, an F999 reject notice will occur.

c. For those EOQ items (ERRCD XB3) which are authorized to bypass MACR factors, an @
must be entered in this field. When personnel enter an @ in this field, the ILS-S will change the
stockage priority codes to J, K, L, M, /, S, T, or U. MACR bypass is not authorized for stockage
priority codes 5 or E.
d. When a demand level is first computed for a non-NSN consumable item, an SPC E is
automatically assigned by the releveling program. If local management wants to begin stocking
the item, the SPC code should be changed to equal the current value of the item 101-MISSION-
IMPACT-CODE. See Para. 2.2.32. for additional details about SPCs.
10. Mission Support Kits. Enter an M for mission support kits or leave blank if no change is
required.
11. Issue Exception Code. Enter the desired exception code to be loaded to or changed on the
item record (Note 3). Leave blank if no change is required. An exception phrase record must
already be loaded for the input code or an F999 management notice is generated if an exception
code is not loaded.
a. IEX 9. The base Bioenvironmental Engineering Service will determine the correct code
according to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. Inspection is responsible (in conjunction with the
Base Environmental Flight) for managing the assignment and deletion of issue exception code 9.
Note: This function may be performed by the Hazardous Materiel Pharmacy as assigned.
b. Issue exception codes E or K edits are specified in reject notice 477 (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information about rejects). Before loading IEX E or K, ensure all
outstanding transactions (degraded operations, etc.) are processed.
c. Assign issue exception code N to identify those controlled item code items that are authorized
on bench stock. When an FCD is input, the other assets flag that identifies bench stock items
will not be assigned by the ILS-S. The ILS-S will assign the bench stock flag when it is
processing the master bench stock inputs.
d. Issue exception code O can only be assigned by FCD input if the RAMPS-Report-Codes are
not 5 or 7.
e. Issue Exception Code or Blank (position 41). A bin label request (WLC) transaction will be
produced when IEX 9 is added or deleted from the item record. When issue exception code 9 is
loaded, the ILS-S will produce an F228 management notice. See Para. 5.2.14. for more
information on issue exception codes.
12. Excess Exception Code. Enter the desired exception code to be loaded to or changed on the
item record (Note 3). Leave blank if no change is required. An exception phrase record must
already be loaded for the input code or an F999 management notice is generated if an exception
code is not loaded.
13. Requisition Exception Code. Enter the desired exception code to be loaded to or changed on
the item record (Note 3). Leave blank if no change is required. An exception phrase record must
already be loaded for the input code or an F999 management notice is generated if an exception
code is not loaded.
a. Requisition exception codes 1 and 3 will be restricted to status/SNUD processing. These
codes will not be loaded through FCD processing.
b. Requisition exception code 2, is restricted to item records with routing identifier codes of
JB*.
14. Shipment Exception Code. Enter the desired exception code to be loaded to or changed on
the item record (Note 3). Leave blank if no change is required. An exception phrase record must

already be loaded for the input code or an F999 management notice is generated if an exception
code is not loaded.
15. Base Closure Flag. To load the base closure flag to the item record, enter a B.
16. Health Hazard Flag. To load the health hazard flag to the item record, enter an H in position
45. Inspection is responsible (in conjunction with the Base Environmental Flight) for managing
the assignment and deletion of the health hazard flag.
17. TCTO Flag. To load the TCTO flag to the item record, enter a T.
18. Mission Change ISSL Delete Flag (position 47). An "I" will appear on the FCD/149 screen
when the inquiry is used if a mission change ISSL is loaded. Program NGV849/A01 will
produce FCD inputs with an asterisk (*) to delete the mission change data flag.
19. Suspect Materiel Flag. To load the suspect materiel flag to the item record, enter an S.
20. Source of Restriction. Enter the source document, which required the assignment of the
input code--that is, TO, message, letter, etc. If desired, use this field as determined locally, to
identify the individual or section/element making the input, the reason for the input, technical
order, or other references, etc. Any data in this field will be copied on the ECC output if an E is
reflected in position 4 of the FCD input.
21. Enter an asterisk (*) to delete the flag or blank existing data. The exception code monitor,
designated for a specific code, is responsible for processing FCD inputs to change that code.
22. Fast Transportation Denial Code. Loading this denial code will prevent assignment of RDD
777 and Project Code 780 to stock replenishment requisitions that otherwise meet the ILS-S
criteria for RDD/Project code assignment. The denial code should be assigned when notified by
either the LRS/Materiel Management Activity or the source of supply that the cost of fast
transportation is prohibitive based on the size or weight of the item.
   2.2.34. C-Factors.
       2.2.34.1. Purpose: Describe the ILS-S logic for assigning C-factors.
       2.2.34.2. In May 2002, the Air Force Supply Executive Board approved implementation
       of a new C-factor assignment policy based on item mission impact, historical demand,
       and unit price criteria. The C-factor is a multiplier of the standard deviation in the
       computation of the base safety levels. The improved policy was implemented in the ILS-
       S in October 2002. Bases will not deviate from the ILS-S C-factor assignment policy
       without MAJCOM/A4 and AF/A4LM approval. If an exception C-factor is approved,
       follow the procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 to assign the exception C-factor
       in the ILS-S.
       2.2.34.3. C-factor Assignment Logic. The current ILS-S logic for assigning C-factors is
       detailed in Table 2.38 Note: Any item that does not meet the criteria in the table for a
       C-factor of 2 or 3 is assigned a default C-factor of 1.

   Note: C-factor 2 is authorized for items in WRM/MRSP or on supply points, and for any
   other items that satisfy direct or indirect weapon system or support equipment needs.

2.2.34.4. The standard deviation for an ISG is the highest C-factor loaded to the M-(master) or I-
(interchangeable) type items. For example, if the master item has a C-factor of 1 and an
interchangeable has a C-factor of 2, the 2 is used to calculate safety levels.
2.2.34.5. A C-factor of 1 is used in the consumable item economic range models to determine
whether an item should be stocked. Once an item successfully satisfies the range model, the
appropriate C-factor, based on the item mission impact, unit price, and historical demand, will be
used in demand level calculations.
2.2.34.6. There is capability within the ILS-S to assign a C-factor of zero (0). However, users
must understand that the assignment of a zero C-factor will result in no SLQ for the item.
Contact MAJCOM/A4 prior to assigning any C-factor of zero. If an exception C-factor is
approved, follow the procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 to assign the exception C-
factor.
   2.2.35. Base Repair Cycle Time (BRCT).
       2.2.35.1. Purpose: Define and describe the ILS-S calculation of the average BCRT.
       2.2.35.2. Discussion. The BRCT is a measure of the average number of days it takes to
       successfully repair a recoverable item in a base repair shop. The BRCT is item specific.
       When an item is a master or interchangeable within an ISG, the BRCT represents the
       average base repair cycle time across all grouped items.
       2.2.35.3. Calculating Average Repair Cycle Days. Each time a recoverable item is
       turned in to LRS/Materiel Management Activity, the ILS-S calculates and stores the
       number of days that the item was in the base repair cycle. The ILS-S calculation follows:
       (Date of turn in – date of issue – awaiting parts (AWP) days – maintenance delay days)
       AWP and maintenance delays are documented via Due in From Maintenance (DIFM)
       status codes. Additional information about the DIFM status codes that indicate AWP
       delays and maintenance delay DIFM status codes are provided in AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt
       1, Ch 4.
       2.2.35.4. Repair Cycle Day Calculation. The actual repair cycle days are stored on the
       repair cycle record by the turn-in program. The average base repair cycle days for an
       item are calculated by the ILS-S during requirements computations. The average BRCT
       for an item is used in ILS-S RCDL calculations. To calculate the average BRCT for an
       item, the ILS-S uses data from all quarters of the repair cycle record. Note the number of
       days used as the repair cycle time for calculating Repair Cycle Demand Levels (RCDL)
       is based on the maintenance priority code as described below:
           2.2.35.4.1. Maintenance Priority Code (MPC) 4 or 7. When the maintenance priority
           code is 4 or 7 (non-critical item) and the average repair cycle days are greater than 10,
           the ILS-S uses 10 days. When the average repair cycle days are less than 10, the ILS-
           S uses the actual days.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   127


        2.2.35.4.2. MPC 3, C, L, or T. When the maintenance priority code is 3, C, L, or T
        (critical item) and the average repair cycle days are less than 4, the ILS-S uses 4 days.
        Otherwise, the actual average repair cycle days are used.
     2.2.35.5. Computing Demand Levels. If less than 4 serviceable TINs are used to
     calculate the BRCT, and the computed average is less than 4 days, the ILS-S defaults to a
     4 day BRCT to compute demand levels. Similarly, if the calculated BRCT is based on
     less than 4 serviceable TINs and the average BRCT is less than 9 days, then the ILS-S
     defaults to a 9 day BRCT for calculating demand levels. However, if the item average
     BRCT is calculated for 4 or more serviceable TINs, then the calculated average BRCT is
     used in the demand level calculation. Finally, if a computed BRCT for an ERRCD XD1
     item exceeds 6 days, the ILS-S uses a 6-day BRCT to calculate demand levels for these
     items.
     2.2.35.6. Exception BRCT. Under normal conditions, the exception repair cycle days
     field on the repair cycle record is blank because the average number of repair cycle days
     is calculated by the ILS-S during the requirements computation process. Be careful when
     you enter zeros in this field; this action will result in the repair cycle quantity portion of
     the demand level becoming zero. Take the following actions to request, load, and update
     exception repair cycle days.
        2.2.35.6.1. Requesting Exception BRCTs.          Requests for          BRCT exceptions
        concerning groups or categories of items must be justified and        submitted by Stock
        Control through command channels to AF/A4LM for approval.              The Stock Control
        Officer or equivalent is authorized to approve exceptions on an       individual line item
        basis.
        2.2.35.6.2. Loading Exception BRCT. When approved, Stock Control will load the
        approved exception repair cycle days on the applicable repair cycle records with FRR
        inputs prepared as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. Exception repair cycle
        days normally override the average RCT and may be loaded to the repair cycle record
        only when approved and documented. However, loading exception repair cycle days
        on an interchangeable or supplemental stock record (-2) will not affect the
        requirements computation process (the loaded BRCT does not override the computed
        BRCT). Exception repair cycle days must be loaded to the repair cycle record as
        follows:
            2.2.35.6.2.1. ISG Items. If exception days apply to a master/interchangeable
            group, the exception data must be loaded to the master repair cycle record.
            2.2.35.6.2.2. Supplemental Records. If exception days are required on stock
            numbers that also have a supplemental record (-2 stock number), the exception
            data must be loaded to the repair cycle record for the basic stock number.
        2.2.35.6.3. Reviewing Exception BRCT. Stock Control personnel must review all
        repair cycle records that contain exception repair cycle days quarterly. To review
        these records, use the Repair Cycle Data List (Q04) or a locally devised query
        program. Delete exception BRCTs when they are no longer required or when their
        use is no longer justified. Also delete any exception BRCT loaded to interchangeable

          or supplemental records. If applicable, load the exception data to the master/basic
          repair cycle record.
   2.2.36. Base Consumption Data Report Format (7SC).
       2.2.36.1. Purpose: The Air Force Secondary Item Requirements System (SIRS)
       (D200A) requires base consumption data to compute quarterly buy and repair
       requirements for Air Force-managed items. In the future, the ILS-S will provide the
       required base failure data by NSN, MAJCOM, and weapon system each quarter via Base
       Consumption Data Report (7SC) transactions.
       2.2.36.2. 7SC transactions are generated for all stock numbers with an F(x)(x) routing
       identifier and an ERRCD of ‘XD’ or ‘XF’ or ‘XB’ only if the quarterly RTS, NRTS, or
       COND quantity is non-zero. Note the NRTS, RTS, and COND quantities for all items
       are floored at zero. That is, if the positive quantity during a quarter is greater than the
       negative quantity, the 7SC transaction reports the positive difference. If the negative
       quantity during a quarter is greater than the positive quantity, zero is reported. Items that
       meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the 7SC process:
          2.2.36.2.1. Stock numbers with ‘P’ or ‘L’ in position 5 of the stock number field.
          2.2.36.2.2. Stock numbers with ‘ND’ in positions 5 and 6 of the stock number field.
          2.2.36.2.3. Stock numbers with ‘X’ in position 14 of the stock number field.
       2.2.36.3. The transaction histories and selection logic for generating recoverable
       (XF3/XD2) and consumable (XB3) item 7SC transactions is provided Table 2.39

   2.2.37. Counting Base Assets.
        2.2.37.1. Purpose: Provide additional details for determining “base assets.”
        2.2.37.2. A count of total base assets is used as the basis for ILS-S consumable and
        recoverable item reorder decisions. Total base assets are defined as the sum of:
           2.2.37.2.1. Item record serviceable balance.
           2.2.37.2.2. Unserviceable XD*, XF3, and XB3 items with detail organization code
           920 and unserviceable status code is H.
           2.2.37.2.3. Firm DIFM balance (DIFM status flag = 0, 3, 4).
           2.2.37.2.4. Supply Point/MSK detail balance.
           2.2.37.2.5. Due-in balance. This balance includes due-in details with a special
           requirement flag R, which determines the quantity of items to be requisitioned. The
           total asset field on inquiries includes the due-in balance with the special requirements
           flag.
   2.2.38. Requirements Computation.
        2.2.38.1. Purpose: To describe the process and procedures associated with the
        requirements computation. Within the ILS-S, requirements computation is the
        comparison of the inventory position to the total base need. As a result of this
        comparison, the ILS-S may produce due-in cancellation requests (ACl), requisitions
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 133


     (A0x), notices (such as funds requirement images (FRC)) that require some external
     action, and release on-hand balances to due-outs.
     2.2.38.2. Before the ILS-S can perform requirements computation, the inline application
     programs must store an R in the requirements computation flag field of an item record
     whenever an adjustment in the assets or demand data is made. (For the ILS-S
     transactions (TRICs) that store an R on the item record, see Table 2.42) After an R is
     stored on the item record, the requirements scan program can begin requirements
     computation. The requirements scan program performs requirements computation as
     follows:
        2.2.38.2.1. Selecting Item Records for Review. The requirements scan program first
        reviews all item records for an R stored in the requirements computation flag field.
        The number of records reviewed is recorded daily on the 027-ITEM-ACCOUNTING-
        CONTROL-RECORD. Note: If an item is a master or interchangeable, the entire
        group is reviewed. For example, if a master item requires review, the ILS-S first
        consolidates data from all related interchangeable items in the ISG and then reviews
        all the records together. If the item record does not contain an R, the record is
        bypassed. If the item record contains an R, the ILS-S performs requirements
        computation or file status as follows:
            2.2.38.2.1.1. Requirements computation only is performed if the file status
            quarter code equals the current quarter code. This denotes that file status has
            already been accomplished for this item during the current quarter. If the
            inventory position is below the total base need and the item is EOQ, the item
            record demand level may be recomputed and adjusted. If so, the date of last
            releveling is then updated.
            2.2.38.2.1.2. File status is performed if the file status quarter code does not equal
            the current quarter code. This denotes that file status has not been accomplished
            for this item during the current quarter. To perform file status, the ILS-S follows
            the procedures outlined for Type Redistributable Category Review Code “A.”
            The item record demand level and the date of last releveling are then updated.
            For additional information on file status processing in the ILS-S, see Para 2.2.41.
        2.2.38.2.2. Reviewing Selected Item Records. When an item is reviewed under
        requirements computation, the ILS-S takes the following actions:
            2.2.38.2.2.1. Blanks the item record requirements computation flag field.
            2.2.38.2.2.2. Produces stock replenishment requisitions or fund requirement
            inputs each time the inventory position are equal to or less than the reorder point.
            Specific procedures for requisitioning can be found in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B,
            Order and Requisitioning.
            2.2.38.2.2.3. Due-in cancellation requests are automatically produced whenever
            an item is reviewed during requirements computation or file status and an excess
            condition exists. A status detail record is created with status code ZD -
            cancellation requested by requisitioning activity - in the status field. Other status
            details and the due-in detail will not be altered by the ILS-S until the source of
            supply confirms the cancellation. Due-in excess is the portion of the total assets
134                                              AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      that exceeds the total base needs. The system requests cancellation requests for
      the quantity above the requisitioning objective plus due-outs. Due-ins with
      special requirements flag R or T are figured into the requisitioning objective when
      computing the requisition quantity; however, they are not considered as assets
      when computing due-in excess. Requests for cancellation are determined and
      AC1 transactions are produced according to the following rules:
         2.2.38.2.2.3.1. Requisition cancellation requests will be automatically created
         and sent to the source of supply for excess due-ins using the following
         sequence:
           2.2.38.2.2.3.1.1. Priorities 01-10 not marked for a due-out are canceled
           first.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.1.2. Priorities 11-15 and 99 are then sorted in descending date
           sequence (newest first), and cancellations are requested in that order.
         2.2.38.2.2.3.2. When a partial cancellation is requested, the ILS-S will update
         the existing status detail (ZD) to show total computed excess. If no ZD status
         detail exists, the ILS-S will establish one. Other status details and due-in
         details will not be altered by the ILS-S until the source of supply confirms
         cancellation.
         2.2.38.2.2.3.3. When an excess due-in exists on local purchase items, the ILS-
         S will not change the existing status. It will create a new status detail for the
         excess quantity only.
         2.2.38.2.2.3.4. Due-in assets in excess of the requisitioning objective are
         considered for cancellation by the requirements computation process
         EXCEPT in the following instances:
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.1. Due-ins contain a special requirements flag R.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.2. Due-ins in the CONUS have shipped status on file.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.3. Due-ins marked for a specific due-out. In this case, the
           ILS-S will request cancellation of that portion of the due-in quantity in
           excess of the due-out quantity.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.4. The due-in excess is less than the quantity unit pack
           (QUP).
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.5. Due-in details contain a suppress cancellation flag of S.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.6. Local purchase due-ins have a status detail containing a
           quantity variance code.
           2.2.38.2.2.3.4.7. Local purchase due-ins have a status detail containing a
           purchase order number, have a dollar value of the cancellation quantity less
           than $50, have NO quantity variance code, and are NOT equipment (FE
           account) or materiel management (FB account) items. If an item is a supply
           item, then the item record number of demands must also be one or less. The
           item record (or ISG) must have a maximum level or computed mission
           change level of zero. The base closure/phase-down flag must be 1.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 135


            2.2.38.2.2.4. Releases due-outs when a serviceable balance exists. This is true in
            most cases, except that due-out details are not released for NPPC 4 items that
            contain a TEX code period (.), 8, X, or Z. In addition, if the item to be released is
            in an I&S group and the item is in a lower D043B subgroup (as indicated by the
            ISG source code on the item record), an I023 Management Notice will be
            produced. For example, if the item requested has a source code of BA and the
            available item has a source code of AA, it will not be automatically released. See
            AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information on the I023 Management
            Notice.
            2.2.38.2.2.5. Creates an FEX (forced excess reporting) for unserviceable
            equipment. A redistributable materiel (excess) detail is created for reportable
            items with a source of supply other than AFMC. If an excess detail does not exist
            in the ILS-S, one is created.
  2.2.39. DIC/TRIC for Requirements Computation.
     2.2.39.1. Purpose: Provide the DIC/TRIC codes which when processed will store an R
     in the requirement computation flag field of the item record.
     2.2.39.2. The table below provide list of the DIC/TRICs that update the requirements
     computation flag on the item record.

   2.2.40. Releveling Input (LVL).
   2.2.40.1. Purpose: Provide the input format for the LVL transaction. The LVL transaction
   generates releveling and/or file status on the input stock number. It may also generate an
   XCE for RBL items.
       2.2.40.2. Output. The LVL transaction creates an RBL Inquiry Image (XCE) or normal
       re-leveling output.
       2.2.40.3. Input Restrictions. None.

Contractors (1st position of the RID ‘F’) with ERRC designators XD*, XF3, or XB3,
regardless of demand data on the item record. When processed with the L, re-leveling is
not accomplished--only output of the XCE.
   2.2.41. File Status Processing.
       2.2.41.1. Purpose: Describe the file status process and procedures. File status is
       conducted once each quarter (90 days), to review and update the item record demand
       levels, identify excesses, and delete inactive item records.
       2.2.41.2. File status must be processed against all item records at least once each quarter.
       File status on item records with an alpha budget code or a budget code 8 must be initiated
       and completed during the first week of each new quarter. This is essential because file
       status writes TTPC 4G transaction history records that the D28 report uses to provide
       updated usage data to the Readiness Based Leveling system at AFMC. (If the major
       command determines that file status will be processed more frequently, Computer
       Operations must run program S01/NGV815; this program blanks the item record file
       status quarter code.) Stock Control must determine the type of excess to be processed.
       Stock Control must also, together with the Computer Operations, carefully schedule the
       quarterly file status processing so that the output does not create an excessive workload
       for other flights within the ILS-S.
       2.2.41.3. It is vital the RBL has the most current usage data to allocate worldwide levels.
       If usage data used by RBL is outdated, worldwide levels will not be optimally allocated.
       When processed against item records, file status accomplishes the following:
           2.2.41.3.1. Updates the Demand Level on Each Item Record. Demand levels are
           calculated by the ILS-S for an item or group of items as follows:
              2.2.41.3.1.1. Demand levels are normally recomputed at least quarterly during
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              139


           file status.
           2.2.41.3.1.2. Record Demand Level Computation Data. Transaction histories
           (TTPC 4G) are written by the ILS-S each time an item is reviewed by the ILS-S
           for a demand level change. Produces an I104 management notice when a demand
           level is first established for part-numbered items when the source of supply is
           J(x)(x). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information on the I104
           management notice. An I104 management notice will not be produced unless the
           cost to stock the item is greater than the cost not to stock the item. The cost to
           stock and not to stock can be obtained from requirements computation INQ.
           Assigns stockage priority code E to all part-numbered items when a demand level
           is first established. External management action is needed to stock a local
           purchase item (source of supply J(x)(x)).

         2.2.41.3.10. File status quarter code updates.
             2.2.41.3.10.1. Updates the file status quarter code. This code, calculated by the
             ILS-S, is based on the current date, as follows:

Table 2.44. Code and Date.
          Current
Code      Date
1 or A    001-091
2 or B    092-182
3 or C    183-273
4 or D    274 plus
             2.2.41.3.10.2. File status quarter codes are assigned by the ILS-S. File status
             quarter codes A-D are assigned during requirements computation and file status
             processing. These file status quarter codes are assigned when the redistributable
             materiel (excess) category code is a letter (relevel, report redistributable materiel,
             and request due-in cancellation
                2.2.41.3.10.2.1. File status quarter codes 1-4 are assigned during file status
                processing. File status quarter codes are assigned when the redistributable
                materiel (excess) category code is a number (relevel and request due-in
                cancellation
                2.2.41.3.10.2.2. Any other file status quarter codes are assigned when the
                application program adds an octal 040 bit to the file status quarter code field.
                File status quarter codes are used as a programming technique, and are
                removed by the ILS-S the next time file status is performed.
         2.2.41.3.11. 468 Reject Notices. When a demand level cannot be calculated for an
         item or a group of items, a 468 reject notice is produced by the ILS-S. For instance, a
         468 reject notice is created when an item is frozen therefore a demand level cannot be
         computed. One line of the 468 reject notices contain an I047-I099 or I139
         management notice. The error conditions and corrective actions are outlined in AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7.
   2.2.42. Asset Status/Excess Report Request Transaction - DZE
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 141


     2.2.42.1. Purpose. To assign or update RAMPS reporting codes in the ILS-S or to
     request one-time asset status or excess reports for the wholesale item manager.
     2.2.42.2. Input Restrictions. None.
     2.2.42.3. Output. Updated item record, asset status, or excess report.
     2.2.42.4. Input Format and Entry Requirements. Screen DZE/153.
     2.2.42.5. DZE Processing Methods. ICPs responsible for item management prepare
     DZE, Asset Status/Excess Report Requests, and forward them to the appropriate bases for
     processing. The different report codes on the DZE indicate the frequency and type of
     reporting required. The ILS-S processing of the Asset Status/Excess Report Request
     (DZE) depends upon the RIC of the initiating wholesale activity and the reporting code.
        2.2.42.5.1. DZE Processing for AFMC and Contractor ICPs. DZEs from AFMC and
        contractor ICPs serve two purposes. DZE transactions can be used to 1) code stock
        numbers for periodic asset reporting, or 2) initiate one-time asset reports.
            2.2.42.5.1.1. Coding stock numbers for periodic asset reporting. Air Force and
            contractor ICP materiel managers use DZE transactions to assign RAMPS report
            codes 0-7 to ILS-S item records of stock numbers that require periodic asset
            status/transaction reporting. When a DZE is received by a base, the ILS-S checks
            the input reporting code (0-7) to see if it is consistent with the item record
            ERRCD and RIC. When these codes are not consistent, the ILS-S produces a
            SNUD registration (BDF transaction) and the item record is not be updated.
            When these codes are compatible, the item record AF-RAMPS-REPORT-CODE
            is updated for all system designators. If the item is in an ISG as a master or
            interchangeable relationship established by D043B, the ILS-S will also update
            every other master or interchangeable stock number in the Interchangeable and
            Substitute Group (ISG) with an alpha order code. If the input stock number is in
            an ISG established by any other process than D043B, then the input stock number
            will be changed to a substitute. If RAMPS report codes 5 or 7 are assigned and an
            inventory has not been completed within 30 days, the system will interface with
            the special inventory (1GP) program to request a special inventory. The
            Inventory Section uses the special inventory output notice to conduct a special
            inventory to ensure the reported assets will be accurate. The system will then
            create transaction histories (TTPC 4B, 4G), if required, for each updated stock
            number. The system uses these transaction histories during end-of-day D28
            processing to produce asset status/transaction reports. Future transactions that
            affect inventory levels of RAMPS report-coded item records will also result in
            new asset status/transaction reports.
            2.2.42.5.1.2. Initiating One-Time Asset Status Reports. AF and contractor ICP
            materiel managers initiate Asset Status/Excess Report Requests (DZE) with report
            code 8 to request updated base asset status reports as needed. DZE transactions
            are forwarded to bases for processing. If the input routing identifier code (in
            positions 67-69) is not valid or it is J**, the ILS-S will ignore the request. If the
            item record is not loaded in the ILS-S, the system will produce a DZF (Para
            2.2.43) to advise the requestor that the stock number is not loaded. If all edits are
 142                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


            passed, the system will create a transaction history record that will be used during
            end-of-day D28 processing to produce asset status reports.
         2.2.42.5.2. DZE Processing for DLA, GSA, and Other Service ICPs. DoD ICPs
         other than AFMC and contractor ICPs can use DZE transactions to obtain one-time
         asset status reports and one-time excess reports.
            2.2.42.5.2.1. One-Time Asset Status Report (code Z). DLA, GSA, and other
            Service may request asset status reports from Air Force bases as needed. These
            requests are forwarded to all registered users, via AFMC data systems, as Asset
            Status/Excess Report Request (DZE) transactions with report code Z. When the
            DZE is processed in the ILS-S a DZF, Asset Status Report (Para 2.2.43) will be
            produced and forwarded to the requesting activity. If the item record is not
            loaded or there are no assets to report then a DZF is not produced.
         2.2.42.5.3. One-Time Excess Report (Code P) Requests. When wholesale inventory
         managers need to buy additional inventory they may first query retail activities for
         excess redistributable assets that may be used as a procurement offset. Wholesale
         inventory managers will request a report of the quantity of redistributable assets
         available at the retail level using DZE with report P. These one-time excess report
         requests are forwarded to all registered users, via AFMC data systems, to all
         registered users.
            2.2.42.5.3.1. Conditions where bases do not respond. If the requesting routing
            identifier code on the DZE transaction is J**, the ILS-S will not produce an
            excess report. Further, if the item record is not loaded for the one-time excess
            report request or there are no redistributable balances to report, a report will not
            be produced. Additionally, if the item/group contains previously reported excess
            details for which a response has not been received, then the ILS-S will not
            produce an excess report.
            2.2.42.5.3.2. Base responses to excess report requests. If all edits are passed and
            ILS-S calculations reveal a reportable excess condition exists, the system will
            produce a Report of Customer Excess (FTE) and create an excess detail. Note, an
            excess report detail is eliminated when the quantity reported is no longer excess
            and/or when disposition instructions have been received from the appropriate
            agency and shipping action taken. The format for the FTE transaction is provided
            in Para. 2.2.44 The format for an Excess report detail is provided in this section.
            The ILS-S will report against each system designator as necessary. The system
            will consider the serviceable assets on the item record for the input stock number
            and will report the computed excess quantity. Note the ILS-S will only consider
            and report on the input stock number. Finally, the ILS-S will not report
            redistributable (excess) assets in an ISG that have a numeric parts preference
            code.

is assigned. For AFMC organizations, fund code 29 is assigned. For all other
organizations, fund code 17 is assigned.
6. Excess Exception Code. If the item is reported, the excess exception code in
position 54 must be blanked before submission.
7. Project Code. This field will contain the project code from the FEX input (if
applicable) or RDE if the base closure flag is set on the item record. Otherwise, this
field will be a blank.
8. Supply Condition Code. Code B will be assigned for serviceable excess recapped
tires (-2 stock number). Code A will be assigned for all other serviceable excess.
9. Reporting Base Routing Identifier Code – For satellite accounts the Host RID is
assigned.

       2.2.45.1. Purpose. Provide details about when and how base redistributable (excess)
       materiel is managed by exception in the ILS-S.
       2.2.45.2. Excess Exception Codes. Excess Exception Codes (EEX) are used to identify
       items not subject to normal excess reporting. Excess exception codes are loaded to item
       records using FCD transactions (See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure).
       2.2.45.3. Prior to EEX codes being used, exception phrase records must be loaded in the
       ILS-S as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
          2.2.45.3.1. The exception notice code (ENC) ‘P’ on the exception phrase record
          denotes that a phrase corresponding to the exception code must be printed on the
          output document.
          2.2.45.3.2. The ENC ‘R’ on the exception phrase record denotes the transaction must
          be rejected. For example, an excess exception code (EEX) of 7 is assigned to an item
          record and contains an ENC equal to ‘R.’ The ILS-S would reject any transaction that
          uses the EEX 7 as part of input data in the system. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
          Activity will maintain an Exception Control Card (ECC) supporting the use of each
          EEX if required.
       2.2.45.4. Excess Management Actions. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
       should make sure EEX code assignments are justified and used only when necessary.

  2.2.49. DoD and MAJCOM Equipment Excess Procedures.
      2.2.49.1. Purpose. Introduce the AFEMS Excess Equipment Redistribution Program.
      2.2.49.2. AFEMS Excess Equipment Redistribution Program. The AFEMS Excess
      Equipment Redistribution Program was developed to redistribute excess base funded
      (budget code 9/Z) equipment among Air Force installations. This objective is met
      through the establishment of standard excess reporting procedures and by matching needs
      against those reported excesses. When excesses are matched to needs, AFEMS creates
      and forwards RDOs to the ILS-S. The ES-S component of ILS-S has a comprehensive
      capability that matches excess equipment assets to requirements and allows users (role-
      based) to direct redistribution. Air Force Data Services (AFDS) provides the excess asset
      and Memo due-out data through an interface with ES-S. The Asset Distribution List
      (ADL) from Equipment Requirements System (ERS) provides the requirements data.
      ES-S matches excess assets to unfilled requirements and presents the user a view of
      recommended matches (asset linked to requisition). The user has the option not to accept
      the match and process the asset to another requisition based on operational needs at the
      time. When the user makes a decision to redistribute an asset, ES-S presents the
      appropriate transaction screens to the user in chronological order of processing. The user
      validates the data populated in the screens and submits the transactions to the applicable
      SBSS accounts for processing. ES-S automatically performs a final check to validate the
      requisition is still viable and asset is still available before allowing the transactions to
      process. Equipment Redistribution Reports are available and used to verify the
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             151


     effectiveness of the redistribution functionality. See Chapter 9 of the ES-S User’s
     Manual for more information on the Manage Excess Equipment Redistribution
     capabilities.
     2.2.49.3. Scope.    All bases will participate in the AFEMS Excess Equipment
     Redistribution Program. The ILS-S reports equipment shortages (XSA) and serviceable
     equipment excesses (XGG) daily to the AFEMS. See Equipment Management for the
     XSA and XGG transaction formats. The excesses are matched to the shortages by the
     AFEMS and RDOs are generated when matches occur.
     2.2.49.4. AFEMS Excess Equipment Redistribution Program Responsibilities.
        2.2.49.4.1. AFMC SCM-R Information            Technology     Activity/   LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity Responsibilities.
           2.2.49.4.1.1. Establish procedures and guidelines.
           2.2.49.4.1.2. Develop management tools to evaluate effectiveness of the system.
        2.2.49.4.2. AFEMS Responsibilities:
           2.2.49.4.2.1. Function as single point program manager.
           2.2.49.4.2.2. Evaluate system effectiveness.
           2.2.49.4.2.3. Monitor program and provide status briefings as required.
           2.2.49.4.2.4. Process excesses and shortages reported by the bases daily and
           provide output to the ILS-S via the Defense Data Network (DDN).
           2.2.49.4.2.5. Furnish statistical data to major commands as requested.
           2.2.49.4.2.6. Maintain current records of all excesses and shortages reported
           under the program.
           2.2.49.4.2.7. Generate follow-up transactions (BF7) to the shipping base and
           shipment notification (99S) transactions and denial notices (AE*) to the gaining
           base.
           2.2.49.4.2.8. Provide excess disposition notices (XSI) for base funded (BC 9 or
           Z) equipment items that have been excess at the base for over 120 days. See Ch 5
           for the XSI transaction format.
        2.2.49.4.3. Base Responsibilities.
           2.2.49.4.3.1. When the D24 is processed, XGG transactions are output and
           automatically forwarded to AFEMS. Additionally, FCD transactions are created
           for the equipment items, that when processed in the ILS-S, will load an Excess
           Exception Code (EEX) of “A” to the equipment item records. The FCD
           transactions are created on all budget code 9 and Z item records that meet the
           following criteria:

                 2.2.49.4.3.1.5. Fifth position of NSN is 0 (zero), L, or P.
                 2.2.49.4.3.1.6. EEX is blank.
         2.2.49.4.4. The AFEMS directed RDOs will be processed on a non-reimbursable
         basis, and issues to organizations will be made on a free issue basis.
         2.2.49.4.5. The shipping base is responsible for the packing, crating, and
         transportation of all directed shipments.
         2.2.49.4.6. System and procedural problems or recommended improvements will be
         forwarded through command channels to HQ AFMC/LE and AFMC SCM-R
         Information Technology Activity/ LRS/Materiel Management Activity respectively.
      2.2.49.5. Redistribution Input/Output Transactions.
         2.2.49.5.1. The AFEMS will provide an excess disposition notice transaction (XSI)
         to the ILS-S when a report excess is over 120 days old.
         2.2.49.5.2. XSA outputs are produced daily for budget code 9 and Z memo due-outs.
         XSA outputs require no external review.
         2.2.49.5.3. Input to the AFEMS excess equipment program of all XGG and XSA
         outputs received from the ILS-S creates the following input:
             2.2.49.5.3.1. The A2* transaction is sent through DDN to the shipping base and
             creates an RDO. See Para 2.2.53 for the A2* transaction format.
             2.2.49.5.3.2. The 99S transaction input is sent through DDN to the receiving base
             and creates a due-in detail record in the ILS-S. See Para 2.2.50 for the 99S
             transaction format.
             2.2.49.5.3.3. The XSI transaction is sent through DDN to the base reporting an
             excess for over 120 days. This input creates an excess report (FTE) or TRM, as
             applicable, and changes the assigned excess exception code from A to 2
             preventing further reporting through the AFEMS. Prior to the actual 120th day
             and when storage space is a problem, a base may request FEX input authority for
             specific items. During the 120 days that an excess base funded equipment asset is
             reported to AFEMS, these additional actions may take place: If the base GSD
             stock fund has not been reimbursed for the asset, attempts may be made to sell the
             item, even if at a reduced price. Last resort would be to free issue the asset to a
             local base requester. If the SMAG has been reimbursed for the asset, it may be
             issued free to a local base requester. See Equipment Management for the XSI
             transaction format.
             2.2.49.5.3.4. The AE1 transaction is sent through DDN to the receiving base to
             cancel their due-in detail when the shipping base has denied the RDO. See Ch 5
             for additional information about AE1 transactions.
             2.2.49.5.3.5. The AFEMS-directed RDO and due-in detail record serial numbers
             start daily with A001 and can go through A999.
             2.2.49.5.3.6. The BF7 transaction is sent through DDN to the shipping base when
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                153


             the receiving base has not confirmed or denied an RDO. See Para 2.2.55 for the
             BF7 transaction format.
             2.2.49.5.3.7. Anytime an equipment item is shipped, the ILS-S generates a
             Shipping or Receiving Report (XGI) transaction to notify AFEMS of the
             shipment. See Table 5.167 for additional information about equipment item
             Shipping or Receiving Reports.
      2.2.49.6. Reporting L and P Stock Numbered Items.
         2.2.49.6.1. The AFEMS will provide the online capability to review all reported
         excesses, and to record and view descriptive data for L and P stock numbered
         equipment excesses. If a requirement exists at your base for an excess item at another
         base, in the AFEMS equipment excess program, contact that base stock control
         excess monitor for lateral support.
         2.2.49.6.2. The LRS CC/AO has the option to retain L and P equipment excesses
         without reporting to the AFEMS equipment excess program if a future requirement is
         expected due to the nature of the asset. Use FEXs that contain A in position 54
         output by file status as the indication of excess. Other means may also be used at
         local discretion.
         2.2.49.6.3. Excess L and P stock numbered items will be reported to the AFEMS
         using the XGG to report the excess quantity and the AFEMS online transaction local
         purchase description (ILPD). Ensure the identity of the losing organization, which
         will make available the shop name for those specialized items which are applicable to
         only one or two organizations. This information is not required for those items which
         have a widespread application, such as office machines and air conditioners.
         2.2.49.6.4. Do not report AFMC-managed centrally procured L and P stock
         numbered items to the AFEMS equipment excess program. Report these items to the
         applicable IM.
   2.2.50. Prepositioned Materiel Receipts - Input/Output (99S).
      2.2.50.1. Purpose. Provide the format for a Propositioned Materiel Receipt transaction
      for equipment item redistributions. The 99S transaction is produced by the Air Force
      Equipment Management System whenever AFEMS has matched an equipment shortage
      to a reported excess. When the 99S is processed, the ILS-S creates a due-in detail against
      which the base that will receive the excess asset. The 99S transaction is also used in
      Automated Mission Change/Base Closure actions to transfer due-outs and to establish a
      due-in and a credit DIFM detail.

   2.2.51. Redistribution Order (RDO) Asset Release Rules.
      2.2.51.1. Purpose. Explain the rules for releasing base assets for shipment in response to
      wholesale source of supply-initiated RDOs.
      2.2.51.2. Processing Directly into SBSS. When an A2*/A4* is processed directly into
      the SBSS (either through SIFS or screen processing), the ILS-S releases serviceable
      assets (identified by A or B in position 71) according to the A2*/A4* input priority.
      Note: RDO’s for Contractor ICP managed items will be allowed to release down to
      zero.
          2.2.51.2.1. RDOs for MICAPs (RDD equals 999 or N**). All available assets will
          be automatically released to zero balance. The asset release sequence is as follows:
              2.2.51.2.1.1. Input NSN item record balance.
              2.2.51.2.1.2. Item record balance on other NSNs within the same ISG. One way
              interchangeability rules are enforced.
              2.2.51.2.1.3. Supply point assets with the input NSN.
              2.2.51.2.1.4. Non-deployed MSK assets with the input NSN.
              2.2.51.2.1.5. Non-deployed RSP assets with the input NSN.
              2.2.51.2.1.6. If the total RDO quantity cannot be satisfied via the release of assets
              with the requested NSN, then assets will be released for other qualifying NSNs
156                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             within the ISG, beginning with supply point assets, followed by non-deployed
             MSK assets, and non-deployed RSP assets. If assets are located in off-base
             supply points, or are in deployed status, or are in DIFM status, an I136
             management notice will be produced and a RDO/Referral suspense detail record
             will be created. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for additional information
             about the I136 management notice.
         2.2.51.2.2. RDOs for Non-MICAPs (priority 01-15). Item record balance will be
         automatically released to the requisition objective (RO). When the item record
         balance is equal to or less than the RO, the RDO will be denied. The asset release
         sequence follows:
             2.2.51.2.2.1. Input NSN item record balance.
             2.2.51.2.2.2. Item record balance on other NSNs within the same ISG. One way
             interchangeability rules are enforced.
             2.2.51.2.2.3. Supply points assets with the input NSN.
             2.2.51.2.2.4. Non-deployed MSK assets with the input NSN.
             2.2.51.2.2.5. If the total RDO quantity cannot be satisfied via the release of assets
             with the requested NSN, then assets will be released for other qualifying NSNs
             within the ISG, beginning with supply point assets, followed by non-deployed
             MSK assets. When non-MICAP RDOs are processed, item records will be
             released beginning with input stock number and continuing through the ISG until
             either the RDO quantity is filled or the ISG quantity equals the RO. If assets are
             located in off-base supply points, or are in deployed status, or DIFM status then
             an I136 management notice will be produced and an RDO/Referral suspense
             detail record will be created.
      2.2.51.3. Processing through ES-S. When an A2* is passed through ES-S (that is,
      DLATS sends the A2* to ES-S vs. directly to a specific SBSS), the A2* will be subject to
      some slightly different asset availability rules. These rules are designed to ensure that the
      A2* is acknowledged (either or confirmed or denied) as soon as possible and to reduce
      the number of A2* suspended on RDO suspense details. The asset availability rules used
      in this process are very similar to those used for the ES-S automatic lateral support
      (sourcing) component (see Chapter 12 of the ES-S User’s Manual for more information).
      That is, asset availability is based on the priority of the A2* as compared to the base asset
      position and automatic accessibility of the assets (freeze codes, deployed indicators, etc.).
      The Shipment Exception Code does not apply to RDO processing. Note: RDO’s for
      Contractor ICP managed items will be passed through ES-S to the applicable SBSS
      without additional edits.
  2.2.52. Common RDO (A2*), Referral Order (A4*), and Excess Disposition Shipment
  (FTR) Rejects and Corrective Actions.
      2.2.52.1. Purpose. Discuss common RDO/referral order reject conditions and corrective
      actions. For a complete list of rejects see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7.
      2.2.52.2. Common RDO and Referral Order Rejects.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               157


        2.2.52.2.1. 224 Reject. This reject occurs when an FTR is processed and the
        shipment has already taken place. If the shipment has been previously processed,
        destroy the input. If the input document number is incorrect, correct and re-input the
        FTR.
        2.2.52.2.2. 296 Reject. This reject occurs when the item record of the input stock
        number is frozen. Corrective action is explained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8
        for freeze code load and delete for budget code 8 stock numbers.
        2.2.52.2.3. 307 Reject. This reject occurs when the reason for disposal code is blank
        or in error. Correct and reinput.
        2.2.52.2.4. 321 Reject. This reject occurs when the supplementary address field on
        the referral order is blank or in error. Correct and re-input. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
        Pt 2, Ch 5 for additional details about how to correct the supplementary address.
        2.2.52.2.5. 326 Reject. This reject occurs when the TEX code is not authorized. If
        the supplementary address field of the A2*/A4* contains YDISPL, the TEX code
        cannot be used in manual operations.
        2.2.52.2.6. 329 Reject. This reject occurs when the unit of issue is unequal or in
        error. Correct the unit of issue and/or quantity and re-input. If necessary, contact
        Records Maintenance for assistance and the requesting organization to verify the
        quantity desired.
        2.2.52.2.7. 352 Reject. This reject occurs when the input routing identifier or vendor
        code is blank or in error. Correct the routing identifier code and re-input. The
        routing identifier code may not be blank or contain special characters. On FT inputs,
        the shipped-to storage point cannot be blank, GGO, S9(x), SMS, HR1, or contain
        code S01. When the input is an SHP and the TEX code is R, positions 4-6 of the
        input must contain a ship-to routing identifier code.
        2.2.52.2.8. 362 Reject. This reject occurs when a shipment requires special handling.
        For A2E/A4E shipments, the shipment must be made offline. Process the shipment
        using manual procedures with TRIC SHP. For SHP transactions, prepare the
        document offline and re-input using manual procedures.
        2.2.52.2.9. 369 Reject. This reject occurs when an A2*/A4* is processed and the
        shipping destination record is not on file for the DODAAC being shipped to. To clear
        this reject, either load the shipping destination record and re-input (See AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 loading instructions) or manually prepare the RDO/referral order for
        re-input. When manually preparing the RDO/referral order, provide a valid “ship-to”
        address in positions 86-141 of the A2*/A4* input. When there is a ship-to DODAAC
        in the supplementary address field of the original document, use its address in lieu of
        the requisition DODAAC address. It’s important to check for a ship-to DODAAC in
        the supplementary address field to ensure the property is shipped to the correct
        destination. The address provided in positions 86-141 will be printed on the shipping
        document and used as the “ship-to” address.
        2.2.52.2.10. 392 Reject. This reject occurs when processing a TRM input for a
        serviceable balance when the item does not meet the criteria for automatic disposal
158                                                 AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      action. To reprocess the TRM, a transaction exception code must be entered to
      bypass the criteria.
      2.2.52.2.11. 444 Reject. This reject occurs when the system designator/routing
      identifier and SRAN cannot be located in the BASE CONSTANTS-1 record. Work
      with the Computer Operations section to ensure that the BASE CONSTANTS-1
      record is loaded correctly.
      2.2.52.2.12. 469 Reject. This reject occurs when erroneous status is processed.
      Determine the reasons for the conflict between the input and the recorded status.
      Correct the input and reprocess if in error. If the input is correct, as related to
      recorded records, take action to verify that the reject was not caused as a result of
      duplicate processing of status inputs.
      2.2.52.2.13. 520 Reject. This reject occurs when an A2*/A4* is processed for a
      retail outlet item (IEX E OR K). When this reject is received, the BSS/IEE must be
      contacted to determine if the required item(s) are available for shipment. If the
      item(s) are available, the A2*/A4* must be reprocessed with a dash (-) in position 80
      and the appropriate TEX code in position 73. For an A2*/A4* (screen #162), there is
      no place to put the dash, so the general-purpose screen (#051) must be used.
      However, for an A2*/A4* (screen #163), position 80 is the last position of the SRAN
      compare field.
      2.2.52.2.14. 528 Reject. This reject occurs when processing a disposal follow-up
      transaction from DLADS. Document Control should take actions outlined below.
         2.2.52.2.14.1. Reason for Reject. The AFX/AFZ follow-up contains an advice
         code in positions 65-66 to indicate the reason for the follow-up. The reason for
         the reject can be determined by using the following advice codes:
             2.2.52.2.14.1.1. Advice Code 35. This code tells you that the quantities in the
             AS3 sent by LRS/Materiel Management Activity and the XR1 sent by your
             DLADS did not match when they were received by DLADS.
             2.2.52.2.14.1.2. Advice Code 36. This code tells you that DLADS received
             the DLADS-generated XR1 transaction but has not received the LRS/Materiel
             Management Activity -generated AS3 status document. The matching
             shipment-suspense detail transportation control number is blank. This must
             be updated with the transportation control number that the A5J was shipped
             under.
             2.2.52.2.14.1.3. Advice Code 37. This is the opposite of advice code 36.
             This advice code tells you that the DLADS received the LRS/Materiel
             Management Activity-generated AS3 status document but has not received the
             corresponding XR1 transaction from your supporting DLADS. This advice
             code will create a 528 reject from the initial input.
             2.2.52.2.14.1.4. If you receive a large number of AFX/AFZ follow-ups with
             advice code 37, you should contact your DLADS to determine why they are
             not forwarding the required XR1 transaction to the DLADS.
             2.2.52.2.14.1.5. You will only receive a 528 reject notice when the computer
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              159


               cannot automatically respond to the AFX/AFZ follow-up or there is a
               discrepancy in the quantity shipped and the quantity received by the DLADS.
            2.2.52.2.14.2. Processing Actions:
               2.2.52.2.14.2.1. Document Control will review the A5J document in file to
               determine the actual quantity received by the DLADS.
               2.2.52.2.14.2.2. If the quantity matches the 528 reject quantity, reprocess the
               AFX/AFZ input with a C in position 44 and the actual quantity signed for on
               the A5J disposal document in positions 25-29. This will cause an ASZ
               response to be automatically produced and sent to DLADS to clear the
               suspense. No further processing is necessary.
               2.2.52.2.14.2.3. If the quantities on the A5J and the 528 reject do not match,
               determine if a special inventory and reverse-post action have already been
               accomplished. If no special inventory action has been accomplished, forward
               a copy of the 528 reject notice to the Inventory Section for special inventory
               action. Now, reprocess the AFX/AFZ reject with an R in position 44 and the
               actual quantity which was received by the local DLADS in positions 25-29.
               This will cause an ASZ response to be automatically produced and sent to
               DLADS to clear the suspense. No further processing is necessary.
               2.2.52.2.14.2.4. When a signed copy of the A5J disposal document is not in
               the document control file, contact the DLADS and determine if they have
               received the shipment/transfer. Verify the quantity DLA DS received and
               obtain a signed duplicate copy of the document. If the quantity received by
               DLADS and the quantity shipped by LRS/Materiel Management Activity
               match, reprocess the AFX/AFZ with a C in position 44 and the actual quantity
               which was received by the local DLADS in positions 25-29. This will cause
               an ASZ response to be automatically produced and sent to DLADS to clear
               the suspense. No further processing is necessary.
               2.2.52.2.14.2.5. If DLADS confirms only a partial receipt or indicates that the
               shipment was not received, make note of the facts and the amount of quantity
               variance on the 528 reject and forward the reject to Inventory for special
               inventory action. Now, reprocess the AFX/AFZ reject with an R in position
               44 and the actual quantity which was received by the local DLADS in
               positions 25-29. This will cause an ASZ response to be automatically
               produced and sent to DLADS to clear the suspense. No further processing is
               necessary.

187-200       14 Detail Document Number                  Note 10
Notes:
1. Routing Identifier Code (positions 4-6). This is the routing identifier code of the
base that will ship the materiel identified in the A2*/A4* transaction. It should equal a
routing identifier code on the shipping base’s constants record. When positions 4-6 are
blank, positions 77-80 will be edited for an equal SRAN in the base constants record.
If an equal SRAN is located, the program assigns the routing identifier code for the
SRAN in positions 4-6. This enables AFMC to convert to the revised format. For
redistribution order inputs for items with IEX E and K, the BSS/IEE will be contacted
to determine if the required items are available for shipment. If the items are available,
reprocess the redistribution/referral order input with blanks in positions 77-79 and a
dash (-) in position 80. Must equal 001-CSB-RID or a 444 Reject will occur. This
reject occurs when the system designator/routing identifier and SRAN cannot be
located in the BASE CONSTANTS-1 record. Work with the Computer Operations
section to ensure that the BASE CONSTANTS-1 record is loaded correctly. See Para.
2.2.57.
2. These fields may be left blank on input; however, a media status code 2 will be
assigned to position 7 by the program. If the input priority in positions 60-61 is blank,
then priority 13 will be assigned under program control.
3. Supplementary Address (positions 45-50). Leave positions 45-50 blank for
manually prepared RDOs, unless the RDO is being prepared to clear a 369 reject or the
item manager supplied the supplementary address by message or phone call. When
preparing a manual RDO as a result of a 369 reject, it is extremely important to use the
supplementary address from the original input, since it is used to determine where to
ship the property. This reject occurs when an A2*/A4* is processed and the shipping
destination record is not on file for the DODAAC being shipped to. To clear this reject,
either load the shipping destination record and re-input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
Ch 8) for loading instructions) or manually prepare the RDO/referral order for re-input.
When manually preparing the RDO/referral order, provide a valid “ship-to” address in
positions 86-141 of the A2*/A4* input. When there is a ship-to DODAAC in the
supplementary address field of the original document, use its address in lieu of the
requisition DODAAC address. It’s important to check for a ship-to DODAAC in the
supplementary address field to ensure the property is shipped to the correct destination.
The address provided in positions 86-141 will be printed on the shipping document and
used as the “ship-to” address. See Para. 2.2.57.
4. Document Identifier Code (positions 1-3) and Signal Code (position 51).
Redistribution orders A2E and A25 and referral orders A4E and A45 must be
processed using manual procedures, except those directing transfer to DLADS. See
Para. 2.2.52. information about 362 rejects. This reject occurs when a shipment
requires special handling. For A2E/A4E shipments, the shipment must be made offline.
162                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


Process the shipment using manual procedures with TRIC SHP. For SHP transactions,
prepare the document offline and reinput using manual procedures. When the
supplementary address contains YDISPL, prepare a TRM input (see AFH 23-123, Vol
2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for input format).
5. Distribution Code (positions 54-56). A two (2) in position 54 of the A4* input
image identifies reimbursable redistributions. A three (3) in position 54 of the A4*
input image identifies Lateral Reparable TAV. A blank in position 54 of the input A4*
input image identifies AFMC directed RDO. Positions 55 and 56 contain the system
designator.
6. Condition codes, can be A, B or F.
7. TEX/Denial Code (position 73). This code applies when an RDO is reinput to deny
the RDO (using denial codes D, E, F, G, W, or X), to ship off of a specific detail or
substitute stock number, to reinput the A2x/A4x to decrease and/or delete the RDO
suspense detail (220) (TEX *); to let the ILS-S determine where to ship the asset from
(TEX R) or for manual operations (TEX 6). See Para. 2.2.52. for a definition of these
codes. TEX code 6 only applies to priority designator 01-03 MICAP RDOs.
a. If positions 4-6 are blank and position 73 contains an alpha character, manual
operations will not apply.
b. For manual operations, position 73 must contain TEX code 6, positions 4-6 contain
the base RIC, positions 77-80 are left blank (to avoid a 326 REJ), and the A2*/A4* is
reinput.
8. This field is to be used to provide the address for a shipment when the shipping
destination record is not loaded (clears a 369 reject). See Para. 2.2.58. When clearing
a 369 reject, if there is a “ship-to” DODAAC in the supplementary address field, be
sure and use the address that corresponds to it; otherwise, use the shipping address that
corresponds to the requisition DODAAC as normal. This is extremely important since
it determines where the property is shipped to. The address provided in positions 86-
141 will be printed on the shipping document and used as the “ship-to” address. If the
Shipping Destination Record is loaded this input will not override it.
9. This field is to provide additional shipping instructions as needed.
10. This field will contain the MSK, Supply Point, or RSP detail document if the asset
is being shipped directly from the supply point, MSK, or RSP detail.
11. If this is a reinput from an RDO/Referral suspense detail (220 detail), then do the
following:
a. If shipping from detail, use the NSN from the detail.
b. If shipping from substitute, use substitute NSN.
12. If this is a reinput from an RDO/Referral suspense detail (220 detail), then use the
quantity from the supply point/MSK detail, or substitute NSNs.
13. If this is a reinput from an RDO/Referral suspense detail (220 detail), then use the
suffix code on the 220 detail record.

14. Routing Identifier Code (positions 74-76). When processing this transaction
inline, input the RID of the base that directed the movement of materiel identified in
the A2*/A4* transaction.

  2.2.57. ILS-S Responses to RDO and Referral Order Follow-ups
      2.2.57.1. Purpose. Explain how the ILS-S responds to ICP RDO follow-up (BF7)
      transactions and referral order follow-up (AF*) transactions.
          2.2.57.1.1. Responses to RDO Follow-up Transactions. The ILS-S response to ICP-
          initiated BF7 transactions depends upon the status of the RDO when the wholesale
          follow-up transaction is received. See Para 2.2.55 for the BF7 format.
             2.2.57.1.1.1. RDO/referral orders with Shipment Suspense Records. If a
             shipment suspense detail is on file with transportation data, the ILS-S outputs a
             BL7 follow-up reply transaction. The BL7 transaction provides the RDO
             shipping status to the ICP. See Para 2.2.56 for the BL7 transaction format.
             Alternatively, if a shipment suspense detail is on file in the ILS-S without
             transportation data, the system produces an I147 management notice indicating
             the shipment requires research, and sends an AE6 status transaction (with status
             code BD) to the ICP. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for details on the I147
             management notice and how to research the shipment. Supply Requirements
             Section personnel will try to locate the released asset and initiate the appropriate
             actions depending on the results of their search.
             2.2.57.1.1.2. Asset Not Located or Not Shipped. If the shipped asset cannot be
             located or if shipment action cannot be completed, Requirements Section
             personnel prepare a shipment denial (B7*) status input by hand (according to
             Para 2.2.54) and begin action to reconcile the asset balance, e.g., special
             inventory, reverse-post, etc.
             2.2.57.1.1.3. RDO/referral order Suspense Detail Exists. If no shipment suspense
             detail is on file, the ILS-S will search for an RDO/Referral suspense Detail. If an
             RDO/Referral suspense Detail exists, the system produces an I147 Management
             Notice and a one (1) is stored in position 5 of the 220-Filler-1 field on the
             RDO/Referral Suspense Detail. The I147 Management Notice provides the 220
             detail record number. Requirements Section personnel should take action to
             expeditiously resolve the suspended condition, i.e., actually complete the
             shipment or deny the RDO as soon as possible. If any subsequent BF7 follow-ups
168                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             are received for the same RDO, position 5 of the Filler 1 field will be incremented
             by one.
             2.2.57.1.1.4. No Record of the RDO. If no shipment suspense detail or
             RDO/Referral suspense detail exists in the, the system will reformat the RDO
             follow-up request (BF7) and process the BF7 as an A2* transaction, effectively
             re-establishing the original RDO.
         2.2.57.1.2. Responses to referral order follow-up Transactions. The ILS-S response
         to ICP-initiated referral order follow-up (AF*) transactions depends upon the status
         of the referral order when the wholesale follow-up transaction is received. When the
         referral order follow-up is received, the ILS-S searches for a Shipped Not Credited
         (SNC) detail (for distribution code 2 Referrals) or a Shipment Suspense detail (for
         distribution code 3 Referrals). If neither an SNC nor a Shipment Suspense detail
         exists, the system looks for an RDO/Referral Order Suspense detail.
             2.2.57.1.2.1. Shipment Suspense or Shipped Not Credited Detail Exists. If an
             SNC or Shipment Suspense detail exists, and the detail does not reflect shipment
             data, then the ILS-S produces and transmits an AE* transaction with status code
             “BA.” If an SNC or Shipment Suspense detail exists with shipment data, then the
             system produces and transmits an AS* transaction to communicate the shipment
             status to the ICP.
             2.2.57.1.2.2. RDO/referral order suspense detail exists. If an RDO/referral order
             suspense detail exists, the system produces an I147 Management Notice with a
             one (1) in position 5 of the 220-Filler-1 field on the 220 RDO/referral order
             Suspense detail. The I147 Management Notice will list the 220 detail record.
             Stock Control personnel should take action to expeditiously resolve the suspended
             condition, i.e., honor or deny the referral order as soon as possible. If any
             subsequent follow-ups are received, then position 5 of the 220-FILLER-1 field
             will be incremented by one.
             2.2.57.1.2.3. No Shipment Suspense, Shipped Not Credited, or RDO/Referral
             Suspense Detail Exists. If there is no record of the referral order (as indicated by
             the lack of a Shipment Suspense, SNC, or RDO/referral order suspense detail),
             the ILS-S outputs an AE* transaction with “BF” status to indicate to the ICP that
             the base has no record of the referral order. See Ch 5 for a complete discussion of
             AE*
  2.2.58. Nondirected Shipment (SHP) Input.
      2.2.58.1. Purpose. To provide a format to force shipments when AFMC SCM-R Stock
      Control Activity, LRS/Materiel Management Activity or major commands decide that
      shipping action will be taken. This input is normally used for lateral support shipments,
      shipments to vendors for exchange value type items, automatic returns to a contractor or
      from an MSK, supply point, MRSP, or WRM detail, and (4) unserviceable (R920RW)
      asset shipments.

Notes:
1. Routing Identifier Code (positions 4-6). Leave the RIC field blank unless the
shipment is lateral support to other Air Force bases. In those cases, positions 4-6 will
contain the applicable D** RIC of the Receiving base of the property and equates to
the RIC of the DODAAC in the supplementary address.
a. If shipment is to an activity other than an Air Force base, and the item is
170                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


serviceable a Redistribution/Referral Order (A2/A4) must be received/processed.
JLS is no longer a valid RIC for lateral support shipments. Also unserviceable
property can still be processed with TRIC SHP.
b. If shipment is done manually, enter JBW.
c. If the TEX code is R, enter RIC.
2. If this is a shipment from a detail, enter the following data:
a. Ship-to routing identifier code in positions 4-6.
b. Supply condition code A in position 44.
c. Ship-to SRAN in positions 45-50.
d. Fourteen digit document number in positions 67-80.
3. Document Number (positions 30-43) and Supplementary Address (positions 45-
50). The document number and supplementary address must be entered when
shipment is done manually or when the consignee provides a document number for
lateral or equipment shipments.
a. If positions 30-43 contain a document number, positions 45-50 must contain the
ship-to SRAN.
b. If positions 30-43 are blank on input, the MILSTRIP document number will be
program assigned using the ship-from SRAN, current date, and next available serial
number.
4. Supply Condition Code (position 44). Any authorized SCC may be used.
However, when the input is for shipment from a DIFM unserviceable detail record,
the SCC must be equal to the MCC on the detail (otherwise a 260 reject may occur).
The SCC is usually Q for Deficiency Report shipments.
5. Supplementary Address (positions 45-50). If this field is blank, the program will
select the ship-to SRAN from the shipping override record or from the shipping
destination record if RIMCS data are available. If the ship-to SRAN cannot be
determined, the input will be rejected. The SRAN/DODAAC must be valid and not
one of the following ZZZZZZ, 999999, FB0000, or FE0000 or you will receive a 303
reject.
a. If shipment is to non-DoD government agency, enter the applicable FEDSTRIP
code (DLM 4000.25, Vol 6, Logistics Systems Interoperability Support Services).
b. If shipment is a return of vendor-owned assets, enter EYO and the numeric vendor
code.
c. If shipment is base-generated to AF contractors, other DoD agencies, etc., enter
the applicable SRAN or ship-to address.
d. If shipment is unserviceable and the consignee is other than the ship-to storage
point, enter ship-to consignee.
e. For RIW items, no supplementary address is authorized. If the item record
contains a one (1) in the program control flag (for RIW items) and the input is
unserviceable, enter the five-digit numeric serial number in positions 46-50. Make
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               171


certain that position 45 is blank.
6. TEX Code (position 51). The computer produces only an SSC detail when the
TEX code field in position 51 is blank. For TEX code (FIA) assignment, see DFAS-
DE 7077.10M.
a. If shipment results from receipt of 1) materiel damaged in shipment, 2) and
unacceptable substitute, or 3) discrepant materiel when credit is allowed, enter TEX
code P. Make certain that positions 4-6 contain the RIC of the item record and that
positions 45-50 contain the ship-to SRAN or the EY**** contractor activity number
(applicable to budget code 9 or Z).
b. If the Deficiency Report reply indicates credit is to be given for the shipment,
enter TEX code R.
c. If the Deficiency Report reply does not indicate credit will be given, leave blank.
d. If shipment results from receipt of materiel with defects not discovered at the time
of receipt, and if credit is allowed, enter TEX code Z (applicable to budget code 9 or
Z).
e. If shipment is done manually, enter TEX code 6.
f. If shipment is done manually and from a detail, but automatic replenishment is not
desired, enter TEX code F.
g. If shipment is NOT done manually, i.e. is from a detail, but automatic
replenishment is not desired, enter TEX code ‘+’.
h. If shipment is for misidentified items, enter TEX code Q.
i. If you desire to bypass receiving a 520 REJ on IEX codes E and K edits, enter
TEX code A.
j. If you desire to print the output shipping document to the input function, enter
TEX code @. Leave TEX code blank when shipping items from a detail record.
7. Fund Code (positions 52-53). This field will include the following:
a. If shipment is a base-acquired investment item (BC Z) for Air Force Supply Chain
(AFSC ) activities, enter fund code 28.
b. If shipment is a base-acquired investment item (BC Z) for DMA activities, enter
fund code 8c.
c. If shipment is a base-acquired investment item for other than AFSC or DMA
activities, enter fund code 17.
d. If the item record budget code is V (vehicles), disregard note 7 and refer to note 8.
e. If shipment is an unserviceable item shipped to other services, the first position of
the fund code will contain the second position of the item record RIC. The last
position of the fund code will be as follows: enter K if the budget code is S, or enter
J if the budget code is T (when the repair cycle record contains project code 3AC or
3AL). Project code “3AL” is used to identify the automatic return of an
unserviceable, condition code “E”/”F”, NIMSC 5 item for which a replacement will
be requisitioned. Consider the following example: If RIC is FLZ (note L in second
172                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


position) and the budget code is T, then the fund code will be LJ.
8. If the item record budget code is V (vehicles), enter the vehicle registration
number as follows:
a. Enter the first two characters (model year) in positions 52-53.
b. Enter the remaining six characters in positions 67-72.
9. Signal Code (position 54). This field will be blank on input. The computer will
assign signal codes as follows:
a. If positions 45-46 contain FB, FE, FD, or FG, the signal code will be M.
b. If positions 45-47 contain EYO, the signal code will be M.
c. If shipment is for unserviceable items to other services, the signal code will be C.
d. If other than the above, the signal code will be K.
10. Priority Designator (positions 60-61). This field will include the following:
Shipment Priorities are assigned as follows:
a) Input Priority from Turn-in (Automatic Retrograde) or Shipment,
b) Shipment Priority on the SEX Override Record (as applicable) for TIN and SHP;
   (For Retrograde Shipments resulting from Turn-ins, the Maintenance Action

  2.2.60. Shipment Exception Code (SEX) Management.
      2.2.60.1. Purpose. To list and explain shipment exception (SEX) codes, shipment
      modifier, and shipment override records used in the ILS-S to suppress automatic
      shipments. This attachment also details the effects of processing exception coded
      shipments in the ILS-S.
      2.2.60.2. SEX Assignment Criteria. SEX codes are one-digit, alpha/numeric codes
      assigned to items to either restrict shipment or modify output shipment transactions. The
      AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity is responsible for the management and assignment
      of each SEX code, to include maintaining an exception control (ECC) image (as required)
      for each item.
          2.2.60.2.1. Preclude Automatic Shipment. SEX codes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 will cause the
          ILS-S to preclude automatic shipment.
          2.2.60.2.2. External Review Required. SEX codes are also used to identify shipments
          that require external management review before shipment action is taken.
      2.2.60.3. Exception Phrase Record (EPR). The basis for all exception code management
      is the EPR. The EPR supporting shipment exception codes is used to justify and explain
      the reason for assigned shipment exceptions. When normal shipment procedures do not
      satisfy local, MAJCOM, or source of supply requirements, the AFMC SCM-R Stock
      Control Activity may use a combination of exception (SEX) codes, shipment modifiers,
      and shipment overrides to restrict or modify out-bound base shipments. See AFH 23-123,
      Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning exception phrase record creation and
      management.
      2.2.60.4. Exception Notice Code (ENC). The exception notice code (ENC) is contained
      on each EPR in the ILS-S. The ENC is used to augment individual SEX codes and is used
      to either stop (ENC R) or allow (ENC P) shipment processing under special conditions.
      ENC R will “reject” any attempt to automatically ship the item. ENC P will “process”
      and produce a notice of shipment. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more
      information.

       phrases, and ECC management requirements for each SEX code.

        change SEX codes (Stock Control Data Change transaction) when contacted and only if
        the changes are required to meet mission needs. When SEX codes no longer apply, delete
        the SEX with a Stock Control Data Change transaction.
        2.2.60.7. Effects of SEX Code Assignment. Shipment exception codes assigned to items
        in the ILS-S may or may not effect outbound shipment processing. The effect of item
        SEX codes may be altered when combined with the transaction identification code
        (TRIC) and ENC. See Table 2.62 below for specific processing effects.

      2.2.60.8. Shipment Modifier Options. Special mission needs occasionally require some
      modification of normal shipment processing. Therefore, modifier options were developed
      for use to manage special shipment requirements.
         2.2.60.8.1. Precautions for Use. There are potential problems inherit in using
         shipment modifier options. Before selecting any shipment modifier option, gain a
         thorough understanding of all six options and their use.
         2.2.60.8.2. Shipment Modifier Load Options. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
         Activity personnel may load shipment modifier records to modify internal processing
         and output shipment (DD 1348-1A) documents. A SEX code must be loaded to the
         item record for which a shipment modifier record has been created. Once the
         shipment modifier record is established with the modified data elements, the data
         fields on the modifier record will overlay normal input and/or output data. See AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for loading, changing and deleting shipment modifier
         records.
      2.2.60.9. Shipment Override Options. Shipment override record data elements override
      normal shipment data elements when processing automatic shipments, except for RIW
      items. When shipment override records are used, the ship-to-SRAN, mark-for, priority
      designator, and project code data elements in the shipment override record take
      precedence over the respective data elements contained on the ILS-S repair cycle record.
      Three options have been created to exercise the shipment override flag field on the
      shipment modifier record. Note: AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity personnel will
      control all changes, additions, and deletions to shipment override records.
         2.2.60.9.1. Option 1 – Support Center Pacific (SCP). The SCP option is used to
         designate a base operating or participating under SCP procedures. When this option is
         used, turn-in transactions with maintenance action taken code (MATC) 1 through 7 or
         D will be changed by the ILS-S to MATC code D. The item will be shipped to the
         override ship-to-SRAN data element specified.
         2.2.60.9.2. Option 2 - Suppress DD 1348-1A Output Document. This option applies
         to input shipment and replies to reports of excess transactions. To use this option,
         ensure no other supported satellite SRAN uses the shipment exception code you have
         selected. The ILS-S outputs three copies of the DD 1348-1A when this option is used.
             2.2.60.9.2.1. Exclusions for Use. Do not use shipment override option 2 if
             property is to move through Transportation channels. Transportation movement
             requires six copies of the DD 1348-1A. Only three copies of the DD 1348-1A will
             be produced if shipment override option 2 is used. However, if this option is used
             in error, you will need to create the additional copies manually.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             181


         2.2.60.9.3. Option 3 - Suppress Shipment Suspense Detail Record and SSC Output
         Image. The ILS-S will not create a shipment suspense detail record or corresponding
         shipment suspense output (SSC) image when shipment override option 3 is used. Use
         option 3 only for shipment transactions. This option is normally used when property
         is shipped to a collocated account, or when Transportation channels are not used to
         move property. Option 3 can also be used to suppress shipment suspense detail record
         and SSC output image creation when transporting a mission support kit (MSK),
         mobility readiness spares package (MRSP), or a war reserve materiel (WRM) kit to
         its destination. Note: Obtain one-time requests for kit movement by telephone. The
         ILS-S disregards this option if reimbursement is required and a shipped not credited
         (SNC) detail record is created. Make certain no other satellite SRAN located on the
         ILS-S computer uses the SEX code you have selected.

   2.3.2. Unit Cost Ratio (UCR) Impacts.
       2.3.2.1. Purpose. To present factors which affect the gross sales to operating obligations
       plus credit returns (UCR) ratio. The primary objective is to achieve the approved ratio by
       the close of the fiscal year. At most activities the ratio tends to be high at the beginning
       of each fiscal year and gradually decreases as the year progresses. Historically, this is
       because Due-Out commitments carried over from the prior fiscal year become Stock
       Fund obligations early on causing a "bow wave" in the ratio which gradually diminishes.
       It should be noted that all elements in the computation of the ratio are cumulative and
       therefore variations in the ratio become less pronounced as the cumulative values
       increase during the course of the year.
       2.3.2.2. Increase Sales and Lower Ratio. Issues/sales to customers (ISU/MSI) increase
       sales and lower the ratio.
       2.3.2.3. Decrease Obligations and Lower Ratio. The following transactions decrease
       obligations and lower the ratio:
          2.3.2.3.1. Discounts earned on purchases resulting from prompt payment of invoices.
          2.3.2.3.2. RNB detail deletions (1DR) with blank TEX code.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                183


        2.3.2.3.3. Trade in allowance on purchases of materiel toward similar materiel.
     2.3.2.4. Increase Total Obligations and Increase Ratio.      The following transactions
     increase total obligations and increase the ratio:
        2.3.2.4.1. Stock replenishment requisitions to normal sources of supply.
        2.3.2.4.2. Requisitions for initial spares (for example, MCD changes, Readiness
        Spares Packages (RSP) for new modified weapon systems) stockage policy changes
        and increases in WRM requirements.
        2.3.2.4.3. Forced bill payment on a receipt when no RNB exists.
        2.3.2.4.4. Repair expenses of SMAG assets (for example, Air Force-owned
        containers).
        2.3.2.4.5. Expenses incurred from termination of a contract.
        2.3.2.4.6. Transportation expenses paid to a local purchase vendor.
        2.3.2.4.7. Postponement of requisitions that support obligated due-outs (TEX 7, Z) to
        the next fiscal year. This increases the ratio at the beginning of the following year
        when the requisitions are submitted (creates an obligation in the following year
        without a demand).
        2.3.2.4.8. Increases to stockage levels eventually impact the ratio whenever stock
        requisitions are produced. The following are examples of increases to stockage
        levels:
            2.3.2.4.8.1. Base/AFMC SCM-R initiated adjusted levels (for example, levels in
            support of bench stock authorizations - directed by code D).
            2.3.2.4.8.2. Forced demand data input (FCL) to increase demands.
            2.3.2.4.8.3. Issues processed as recurring instead of nonrecurring.
            2.3.2.4.8.4. Due-out cancellations with TEX 9 (recurring demands are not
            decreased).
            2.3.2.4.8.5. Invalid use of priorities on issue requests (for example, UJC AZ
            results in stockage priority code 2 and will cause a demand level faster than UJC
            CZ).
     2.3.2.5. Decrease Sales and Increase Ratio. Credit turn-ins (TIN) will decrease gross
     sales.
     2.3.2.6. Individual Transactions That Impact Ratio. The following transactions taken
     individually impact the ratio as depicted below:
        2.3.2.6.1. Local purchase requisitions, status and adjustments:
            2.3.2.6.1.1. A requisition has no impact until a LPS is processed.
            2.3.2.6.1.2. Processing an LPS increases obligations and increases the ratio.
            2.3.2.6.1.3. Processing an LPA to increase/decrease the dollar value of the due-in
            will likewise affect the ratio.
 184                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


          2.3.2.6.2. Due in cancellations:
             2.3.2.6.2.1. AE1/AE9 on depot and TRIC LCC on local purchase requisitions
             (with firm status) decrease obligations and the ratio.
             2.3.2.6.2.2. Cancellation of a local purchase due-ins without LPS on file has no
             impact.
          2.3.2.6.3. Shipments of excess transportation expenses for excess materiel returned to
          depots increase obligations and the ratio.
          2.3.2.6.4. Receipts (REC):
             2.3.2.6.4.1. Receipt not due-in transactions increase the ratio by increasing
             obligations.
             2.3.2.6.4.2. Items received free (MILSTRIP status BN) decrease obligations and
             the ratio.
             2.3.2.6.4.3. Receipts of requisitions with Signal code D have no impact.
          2.3.2.6.5. Requisitions for lateral support:
             2.3.2.6.5.1. If the requisition supports the customer due-out, the ratio decreases
             because there is a sale with no obligation.
             2.3.2.6.5.2. If the requisition is for stock (for example, mission change details),
             there is no impact because there will be no billing.
       2.3.2.7. Transactions That Have No Impact on Ratio. The following transactions have
       no impact on the ratio:
          2.3.2.7.1. Nonreimbursable (free) issues.
          2.3.2.7.2. Ordering customer due-outs from DLADS.
          2.3.2.7.3. Equipment unfunded due-outs (TEX 8, H, or D).
          2.3.2.7.4. RSP transfers (1KT).
          2.3.2.7.5. Noncredit turn-ins (TIN).
       2.3.2.8. Trial Balance Worksheet Computation Of Gross Sales To Obligations Plus
       Credit Returns (Unit Cost Ratio).
          2.3.2.8.1. Purpose. To provide a worksheet for computing operating obligations
          using the same logic as the AR(M)1307 Report (Working Capital Funds Accounting
          Report).

   2.3.4. Example of MACR Factor Development.
      2.3.4.1. Example of MACR Procedure. To determine factors to use in the MACR, you
      must first compute the value of requisitions you anticipate making for the remainder of
      the fiscal year. Then compare this value to the value of TFA that has not been processed
      as requisitions. If the value of anticipated requisitions is greater than the value of TFA, a
      deficit exists and MACR factors are in order. The above matrices in paragraph above
      will be used in the following example of the MACR development process. These
      hypothetical figures will be used as a basis:
         2.3.4.1.1. Total projected requirement            2,000 million
         2.3.4.1.2. Total Financial Authority (TFA)        1,875 million
         2.3.4.1.3. Deficit                                  125 thousand     Note:
         Remember that the figure for total projected requirement and TFA represents
         projections for the remainder of the fiscal year.
      2.3.4.2. Items Normally Not Suppressed. No suppression of ordering should be applied
      to items that are highly essential for missions or that have high sales potential.
         2.3.4.2.1. Mission essential items. SPC 1 identifies MICAP items; SPC code 2
         identifies urgency of need code A items. SPC 1 and 2 items in all subgroups will
         therefore normally be requisitioned at 100 percent. To signify 100 percent
         requisitioning of these items, enter a blank (b) (as above) in matrix positions A1, A2,
         B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, and D2.
         2.3.4.2.2. Sales potential items. Normally items having high sales potential will also
         be requisitioned at 100 percent. These items are usually bench stock and Base
         Service Store items. (Recall that A is bench stock, B is individual equipment, C
         represents Base Service Store and tool issue items, and D is other items.) To
         eliminate high sales potential items from consideration temporarily, enter blanks in
         matrix positions A3, A4, C3, and C4.
      2.3.4.3. Subgroup B Item Chosen to Reduce Deficit. To continue the example situation,
      suppose an AF policy decision is made to reduce some individual equipment
 188                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       requirements (subgroup B). Funds managers entered blanks in B1 and B2 to withhold
       suppression of critical materiel, but B3 and B4 were not affected by those designations.
       Note in Matrix 1 (Table 2.65.) that the total projected expenditures in B3 were 10,000,
       and in B4, 20,000. Assuming a 10-percent reduction in those two areas, we can
       formulate Table 2.65. (Notice that the figure of a 10-percent reduction is adjusted
       upward when the percent factor is factored in. See note below.)

Table 2.65. Example MACR Requisition Objective--Buy.
Matrix       Percent          Value of 10-percent             Net Value
Pos.         Factor           Reduction
B3           50               1000(x5)                        5,000
B4           40               2000(x6)                        12,000
Note: When computing the actual MACR factor, subtract the first number of the
percent factor from 10 (the reduction of 10 percent). The first number in 10 is 1.
For example, if the percent-reduction factor number is 10, subtract (10-1 = 9) and
9 becomes the number used in computing the net values of reductions. If the
percent factor number is 40 (as in B4 above), subtract 4 from 10 to get 6, and use
6 to compute net reduction value. Enter percent factors of 50 (B3) and 40 (B4) in
Table 2.65. The net value of these two reductions is only $17,000, leaving a
$108,000 deficit (from the original $125,000 deficit) to contend with.
       2.3.4.4. SPC Subgroup D Items Chosen to Reduce Deficit Further. The least essential of
       the category of items is SPC subgroup D. A significant reduction may be possible in this
       area. Enter 50 in position D2, 10 in position D3, and 10 in position D4 of Table 2.66

Table 2.66. Second Example MACR Requisition Objective--Buy.
Matrix          Percent        Value of 10-percent Net Reduction Value
Position        Factor
D2              50             3,000(x5) 15,000
D3              10             5,000(x9) 45,000
D4              10             1,500(x9) 13,500
           2.3.4.4.1. A net decrease of $90,500 ($17,000 from Table 2.65 plus $73,500 from
           Table 2.66) has now been realized, and to this point, no significant impact on mission
           capability or customer support has been made. But with $34,500 (of the original
           $125,000 deficit) yet to be reduced, the only alternative is to apply cuts in some of the
           high-dollar areas.
       2.3.4.5. High-Demand Items Chosen To Reduce Deficit Further. Before using high-
       demand items to reduce the deficit, here are a few points to keep in mind. The use of the
       factor does not eliminate the requirement. It only delays the requisition process. Even if
       a zero factor is used, the program will always compute a minimum requisition quantity of
       the OS&T and safety level quantity plus one. Thus the MACR technique, if applied
       carefully and without FRC inputs, will make backorders less likely to occur. Remember
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  189


       that backorders that occur on items that have a specified level of stockage will cause the
       quantity you are required to maintain to go up. Another point to remember is that when
       MACR adjustments are being made, the computer is responding to two sets of
       instructions, making it possible to stock excess materiel. To spread the remaining deficit
       evenly throughout the high-demand area, use the following factors and enter 50 in C3 and
       C4 of Table 2.67. At this point, the full $125,000 deficit ($17,000 from Table 2.65,
       $73,500 from Table 2.66, and $35,000 from Table 2.67) has been eliminated.

Table 2.67. Example MACR Requisition Objective--No Buy.
Matrix         Percent         Value Of 10-Percent Net Reduction Value
Position       Factor
C3             50              4000(x5) 20,000
C4             50              3000(x5) 15,000
       2.3.4.6. Results. A net decrease in requirements of $125,000 has been made, resolving
       the deficit problem. At this point, an FRC input decision must be made and the actual
       factors computed. Recall that a policy change brought about the reduction in subgroup B,
       individual equipment. Presumably, then, FRCs will be desired for B3 and B4 (but not B1
       and B2, which are priority items). Now go back to the Table of MACR factors Table
       2.68 The new matrix will be as follows, with the letters in place in B3 and B4 indicating
       FRC processing and the appropriate percent factors.

       2.3.4.7. At this point, load the MACR factors on the MACR record using a MACR load,
       change, or delete input (TRIC 1LM).
       2.3.4.8. Delayed Effect of Adjustments. Do not look for immediate results when these
       factors are applied. The MACR factor adjusts the requisitioning quantity at the same
       time that a requirement to requisition is generated. Usually it will be 90 days minimum
       (one file status quarter) before any impact will be noticed. For this reason, once the
       factors are loaded, they should not be changed for one full quarter unless a change is
       essential. Of course, this time lag factor has no bearing on the decision of whether or not
       to use FRCs.

MACR II (332).
5. If MUC equals 11-55 or 59-60, enter dollars and cents. The amount in the GSD
MACR II (332) will be increased or decreased (depending on position 29) by the
amount in positions 36-43.
6. If MUC equals 11-55 or 59-60, enter dollars and cents. (For example, 0000055
is read as $5.55). If MUC equals 61-62, enter dollars only. (For example,
00000555 equals $555.00.) If MUC equals 63-74 leave blank.
7. Percentages are entered in whole numbers from 000 to 100.


   2.3.7. MACR Factors.
      2.3.7.1. Purpose. MACR factors provide a short term, orderly means to stabilize
      programs. Need for MACR Factors. As a rule, MACR factors are necessary any time
      that a deficit can be anticipated. Deficits can occur when the value of anticipated
      requisitions is greater than the value of TFA. Command and local changes in
      requirements can make adjustments necessary.
      2.3.7.2. Stockage Requirements Adjustments. Stock requirements are based on stock
      fund stratification data. No adjustments in this data are made except in operating levels
      and numerical stockage objective requirements. Operating level requirements are
      adjusted to compensate for the lag between demands and obligations dictated by the
      reorder point. At times, adjustments in the form of increases or decreases in stockage
      levels can also be directed by division managers or others at a local level. These changes,
      if approved, are reflected in the operating program. They will be taken into account
      when TFA and requirements are compared.
         2.3.7.2.1. Formula. The sum of the due-out and the factored EOQ plus the order and
         shipping time (O&ST) plus the safety level quantities (SLQ) minus the sum of assets
         on hand (AOH) and due-in (DI) equals the adjusted requisition quantity (ARQ).
         EXAMPLE: (DO + FEOQ) + OST + SLQ - (AOH + DI) = ARQ.                   Note: The
         factored EOQ equals the EOQ times the factor percentage plus .999.
         2.3.7.2.2. Table of MACR factors. In the following table of MACR factors, the
         percent of the EOQ quantity to be requisitioned is given. The factors also provide a
         way of indicating when funds requisition inputs (FRCs) should be produced.

Note: A 7 means 70 percent of requirement is placed on order either by
requisition or FRC image. The other 30 percent is ignored as a
requirement by the computer and will be included in the next
requirements computation.
          2.3.7.2.3. MACR factor by SPC subgroup. To accommodate a MACR factor by SPC
          subgroup within SPC, a 16-character matrix (4 SPC sub-groups across times 4 SPC
          codes down) must be provided in the MACR. Each of the 16 positions in the matrix
          controls an individual subgroup as follows:

 Note: SPC subgroup A is bench stock, B is individual equipment, C is Base Service Store
 and tool issue items, and D is all items not falling in subgroups A, B, or C.

          2.3.7.2.5. Table 2 74 shows how the matrix, when loaded as above, establishes the
          EOQ and FRC directives as follows. Either a number, letter, or blank will appear in
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               195


        the subgroup matrix. If a number appears, it indicates the percentage (9 = 90 percent)
        of EOQ that should be ordered.
            2.3.7.2.5.1. A number indicates the percentage and that no FRC images should be
            produced.
            2.3.7.2.5.2. A letter indicates the percentage of EOQ to order (A = 10 percent; H
            = 80 percent) and that FRC inputs should be produced.
            2.3.7.2.5.3. A blank indicates 100 percent of the EOQ should be ordered and no
            FRC inputs should be produced.
            2.3.7.2.5.4. A plus indicates 100 percent of the EOQ should be ordered and FRC
            inputs should be produced.
        2.3.7.2.6. Illustrative examples. The following list demonstrates how the example
        matrix is to be interpreted. Refer first to the example matrix (Table 2.74) and then to
        the MACR (Table 2.72) to understand the interpretations:
            2.3.7.2.6.1. For SPC 1, all subgroups, compute and requisition 100 percent of the
            EOQ and do not produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.2. For SPC 2, subgroups A and C, compute and requisition 100 percent
            of the EOQ and do not produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.3. For SPC 2, subgroups B and D, compute 100 percent of the EOQ and
            produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.4. For SPC 3, subgroups A and C, compute and requisition 100 percent
            of the EOQ and do not produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.5. For SPC 3, subgroup B, compute 80 percent of the EOQ and produce
            FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.6. For SPC 3, subgroup D, compute 50 percent of the EOQ and produce
            FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.7. For SPC 4, subgroup A, compute and requisition 90 percent of the
            EOQ and do not produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.8. For SPC 4, subgroup B, compute 50 percent of the EOQ and produce
            FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.9. For SPC 4, subgroup C, compute and requisition 70 percent of the
            EOQ and do not produce FRC inputs.
            2.3.7.2.6.10. For SPC 4, subgroup D, requisition 0 percent of the EOQ and
            produce FRC inputs.
     2.3.7.3. Effects of FRCs. After the MACR factor has been used to adjust the requisition
     quantity, an FRC input is produced if necessary. Note: See below for a word of
     precaution on the use of FRCs in MACR factors.
        2.3.7.3.1. If no FRC is necessary and the extended dollar value of the requisition is
        equal to or less than the maximum obligation for stock replenishment, a requisition is
        prepared. However, if the extended dollar value is greater than the maximum
196                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         obligation, an FRC is produced even though not requested in MACR factors due to
         the maximum obligation flag. This system is useful as a way of seeing that managers
         do not overstock and exceed the stockage objectives. It also serves as a caution to
         managers to reconsider requisitions in this circumstance.
         2.3.7.3.2. UND. A UND is a part of the MACR control system. The urgency of
         need operates in conjunction with other MACR controls discussed above. The
         MACR has an urgency of need funding flag, either A (highest priority), B, C, or E
         (lowest priority). When a request is processed, there is an urgency of need
         automatically factored into the request. For instance, if the MACR flag is B and the
         issue request is B or A, and the extended dollar value of the requisition is equal to or
         less than the value loaded to the MACR for due-out requisition, the computer will
         requisition the item. If the request is C, or the extended dollar value is greater than
         the value loaded to the MACR for due-out requisitions, the computer will not
         requisition but will produce an FRC.
         2.3.7.3.3. Deficit Exists. Once it is found that a deficit exists (value of anticipated
         acquisitions exceeds authorized TFA), the stock fund manager and Stock Control
         personnel must make two decisions:
            2.3.7.3.3.1. Decrease of requisitions. In deciding which items to decrease,
            questions about the comparatively essential nature of the SPC of different items
            must be considered. This decision must in turn be influenced by questions of
            sales potential and the limits of the budget.
            2.3.7.3.3.2. Disadvantage of FRCs. Before deciding whether or not to produce
            FRCs to help in planning requisitions, managers should realize the disadvantages
            of using FRCs. The MACR factor system itself provides an automated and highly
            selective way of slowing down orders. FRCs will delay orders further and
            increase the potential for backorders. Remember that the time lag between FRC
            production and actual requisitioning (administrative lead-time) is not considered
            when O&ST is computed. Consequently, for every day an FRC is held, a day of
            stock and pipeline time is lost, thus delaying issue and/or computation of
            projected requirements. Therefore, while FRCs can be helpful, as a rule, they
            should be used only when there are changes in requisition objectives made at a
            command level or when circumstances make future forecasting of needs
            extremely uncertain.
      2.3.7.4. Analytical Tools for Development of MACR Factors.
         2.3.7.4.1. R45 Report. The MACR Factor Analysis Report (R45/NGV862) is the
         primary tool to use in developing MACR factors. It provides for asset stratification
         by SPC and SPC subgroup. The Stock Fund Stratification Program (M20/NGV827)
         is also useful in determining the adjustment amount.
         2.3.7.4.2. Three Matrices.     In addition to the stratification, three matrices are
         provided:
            2.3.7.4.2.1. Matrix 1—Table 2.75 (Actual RO). In this matrix, the values of the
            EOQ segment of the computed requisitioning objective are listed. As in the
            previous matrix, 16 elements of data (4 SPC codes and 4 subgroups) are provided.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    197


               All values appear in whole dollars. The following is an example:

               2.3.7.4.2.2. Matrix 2--Table 2.76 (MACR RO-BUY). This matrix lists the
               values of matrix 1 after suppression (a percent of the total value). For example, in
               SPC 1A, the original amount in matrix 1 was 10,000. Ninety percent of that
               amount is the value after a suppression of 10 percent. Hence, SPC 1A appears as
               9,000(90). In matrix 2, the suppression values are 10 percent for SPC 1, 20% for
               SPC 2, 30% for SPC 3, and 50% for SPC 4.

               model that you can use in working out an approach to requisitioning problems
               through use of the MACR factors. The symbol (b) means blank and implies no
               change (that is, you continue to order 100 % of the stock objective). A (b)
               followed by a number "percent factor" designates an area that should not be
               changed if possible, but that can be subject to lowering of requisitioned quantities.
               A number standing alone designates an area of relatively low priority where initial
               cuts in requisition quantities can be made.

       2.3.8.1. Purpose. To assist you in your decision-making process when placing MACR
       controls on an account. The following information is from a study (Stock Fund Analysis,
       LS890212) conducted by the AFLMA in June 1989.
          2.3.8.1.1. There is no right or wrong MACR factor. Each SMAG manager has to
          apply MACR factors based on the health of their Operating Program and the mission
          of their base.
          2.3.8.1.2. MACR factors will reduce the total dollar value of requisitions for an
          SBSS account and will consequently reduce on-hand inventory. The amount of the
          reduction is proportional to the severity of the MACR alternatives.
          2.3.8.1.3. MACR factors will only work to resolve short-term (6 to 8 months) SMAG
          problems and cannot be used from one fiscal year to the next, unless net customer
          demands decline. If customer demands are on a decreasing trend line, MACR
          factoring is an excellent tool to proactively control the outlay of SMAG dollars and
          the subsequent reduction in inventory.
          2.3.8.1.4. Application of the MACR factor will reduce customer support (backorders
          increase) and generate additional workload for both retail (receipt processing) and
          wholesale (requisition processing and shipping) systems.
          2.3.8.1.5. Holding FRC at base level for a secondary review will reduce customer
          support and increase workload without any real savings.
          2.3.8.1.6. MACR factoring options should be used to control the SMAG when
          customer demands are on the decline or to correct short-term deviations in the SMAG
          operating program. However, MACR factoring is not recommended as a long-term
          solution to correct year-to-year SMAG demands to operating obligations ratio
          imbalances.

Notes:
1. Enter an L to load, a C to change, an I to inquire, or a D to delete a special spares detail. A
code of R indicates a receipt of a transferred special spares detail. The action code R will be
placed in the 1KK input as a result of processing NGV471 spares transfer.
2. Valid TEX codes are 7, P, M, or U. This field may only be used in conjunction with the issue
flag.
3. Enter an N to inhibit automatic MSI processing for this individual line item. A Y will be stored
on the detail if no entry is made.
4. No longer required (still reflected on screen).
5. The item record of the stock number cannot have a NPPC equal to 3 or 9. It must be an ERRC
equal to X in the first position.
6. Enter the system designator applicable to the item record. Mandatory entry on all inputs.
7. Enter the applicable code to be generated in the ISU.
8. Enter the SRD of the end item supported by this line item. This is a mandatory input on loads,
not required on deletes. Required on changes only if it is changing. There must be an MRSP-
IRSP-Control record loaded with the same SRD. If data is entered into this field, all other changes
(except a UTC change) are ignored.
9. The document number is broken down as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       205


Figure 2.14. Document Number Construction.
Position 30 = U
Positions 31-33 = Organization Code >099 <999.
Positions 34-35 = Shop Code
Positions 36-39 = Zeros
Positions 40-43 = Detail Item Number.
10. Must be numeric and greater than zero when the prime sub flag equals a P. Will always be
zero for substitute details (prime sub flag equals an S). This field, for loads, will contain the total
authorization including supportable and unsupportable.
11. Enter a P when loading a prime detail or an S when loading a substitute detail. If it is
required to change an existing substitute detail to the prime detail, enter the stock number of the
substitute detail and the substitute document number in their respective fields and a P in this
field. The prime will be changed to a substitute and the substitute will become the new prime.
The prime detail will be deleted when the on-hand quantity is zero and there are no due-outs on
file for that stock number and document number. ***Changes leave blank unless you are
changing a sub to a prime.***
12. Enter the applicable UTC. Mandatory on loads, not required on deletes. Required on
changes only if it is changing. A MRSP-IRSP-Control record must be loaded with the same
UTC.
13. Enter the applicable project when the issue program is to be called. Leave blank when the
issue flag is to be left blank. If data is entered into this field, all other changes (except an SRD
change) are ignored.
14. If applicable, enter the letter A through Z that represents the ISG subgroup that maintenance
has verified as containing the least acceptable item. This field can be left blank.
15. Must equal 1, 2, 3, or 4. This is a mandatory entry on loads. Optional for changes, not
required on deletes.
16. Enter the applicable logistics increment code. May be blank. To blank this field on a
change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position.
17. Only applicable when the action code equals an L. If used, it must equal an I. ISSUE
INTERFACING INSTRUCTIONS: NO ISSUE INTERFACE WILL TAKE PLACE FOR THE
UNSUPPORTABLE QUANTITY WHEN THE SUPPORTABILITY CODE equals an F.
18. MUST BE ALPHA. Cannot be blank when using the issue flag.
19. Mandatory for loads. Enter the two-position MAJCOM code of the reporting major
command.
20. Must be an H.

cannot be blanked.

22. Numeric. To blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position.
23. Mandatory for loads. This field will be edited as follows:
Positions 84-86 = 157/158/159
Positions 87-90 = Any alpha/numeric combination.
24. (A/N) Mandatory for loads. On a change input enter the change to ASL. Optional for
changes.
25. May be blank if no unsupportable quantity is loaded. On loads of an unsupportable quantity,
may be a blank or F. An F is used to identify items not supportable because of base or command
 206                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


fiscal restraints (no funds available). Leave blank when changing an existing unsupportable
quantity. An asterisk (*) will blank the supportability code and the supportability quantity field.
26. When used, must be numeric. On initial detail loads, its purpose is for issue interface
computations. On loads, this category must have an entry or it will reject.
a. When supportability code equals an F, this field must be 00000 or greater.
b. When making changes to the unsupportable quantity field, input the new quantity. Do not put
a supportability code in on changes unless the unsupportable quantity was previously blank.
There is no issue interface on changes.
27. (A/N). Use as locally determined.
28. Mandatory for loads. This field will be edited for alpha, numeric. On a change input, enter
the change to POB.
29. Mandatory for loads. Enter the two-position MAJCOM code of the using major command.
On change inputs, enter the change to MAJCOM code.
30. (A/N) Use as locally determined.
31. Normally, the following data elements would not be entered into a terminal. When these
details are transferred to another account, program NGV471 will enter this information into the
input along with an action code of R.
32. This will only apply when the action code equals R. This field will reflect the actual
quantity that was transferred for this stock number and document number. When processed, this
quantity will be picked up as the detail on-hand quantity.
33. Enter the Moving Average Cost (extended cost).
   2.4.3. MSK/MRSP/WRM Transfers Between Kits (1KT).
       2.4.3.1. The 1KT input can fill the requirements of a specific detail from any of seven
       different MSK/MRSP/WRM detail records or it can transfer a specified quantity to and
       from detail records. Prime detail records can also be deleted. When required, the
       computer can load or delete substitute detail records automatically. NOTE: 1KT inputs
       cannot be reverse-posted and require inputs to correct any processing errors.
       2.4.3.2. Input Preparation.
           2.4.3.2.1. Leave the action quantity blank when the requirements of the gaining detail
           document number are to be filled from assets recorded on MSK/MRSP/WRM detail
           records specified by the input stock number, system designator, and parameters. The
           total quantity transferred will be a combination of the following.
               2.4.3.2.1.1. The gaining primes
               2.4.3.2.1.2. The authorized quantity minus on-hand assets (including substitutes)
               2.4.3.2.1.3. The due-outs (except when due-out action flag M is used)
               2.4.3.2.1.4. When processing serialized reporting assets, you must process TRIC
               DSR or XHB prior to transfer. Serialized reporting assets cannot be transferred
               using the 1KT multiple option.
           2.4.3.2.2. Transfer the resulting quantity from those assets recorded on the detail
           record as specified by the first parameter of the input. When the deficiency is not
           satisfied by the detail record of the first parameter, check the detail record of the
           second parameter.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               207


        2.4.3.2.3. Continue checking each parameter until all have been verified or the
        deficiency has been satisfied.
        2.4.3.2.4. When the asset position of the gaining detail record does not match the
        authorized quantity, an F206 management notice will be produced.
        2.4.3.2.5. When an action quantity is entered, the computer will transfer this quantity
        to and from the detail record specified by the input.
            2.4.3.2.5.1. Rejects occur when the gaining detail record asset position and the
            action quantity exceed the authorized quantity.
            2.4.3.2.5.2. Rejects occur when a selected detail record is deployed.
     2.4.3.3. Process for Outputs.
        2.4.3.3.1. The computer prepares a transfer document for each transaction.
        2.4.3.3.2. If output of documents is not desired but you wish to enter specific
        quantities, enter a 6 in the input TEX code position.
     2.4.3.4. Due-Out Action Flag. Enter an M when due-outs are not to be considered in the
     authorized versus on-hand computations, and the program will ignore any due-outs. An
     F202 management notice will be produced when due-outs are greater than on-hand
     quantities.
     2.4.3.5. Output Documents.
        2.4.3.5.1. 1KT. The 1KT routine produces a transfer document (see Para. XXX ) for
        each transfer unless TEX code 6 is used.
        2.4.3.5.2. Procedures. When the transfer document is received, the WRM monitor
        will do the following.
            2.4.3.5.2.1. Clear the suspensed creation sheet.
            2.4.3.5.2.2. Transfer assets between or coordinate with kit custodians for the
            transfer.
            2.4.3.5.2.3. Sign the transfer document.
            2.4.3.5.2.4. Distribute documents as follows.
                2.4.3.5.2.4.1. Copy 1 to Document Control
                2.4.3.5.2.4.2. Copy 2 to the losing kit or organization
                2.4.3.5.2.4.3. Copy 3 to the gaining kit or organization
            2.4.3.5.2.5. When serialized reporting assets are transferred, a F117 management
            notice will be output at function 444.
     2.4.3.6. Degraded Operations Transfers. When the Degraded Operations option is used,
     the WRM monitor hand-writes three copies of the transfer document. After the transfer,
     the WRM/RSP monitor signs and distributes the document. “For CSC/MSIA:
     ********** If a print document is not required, these procedures must be used.”
     2.4.3.7. Rejects and Management Notices.
208                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         2.4.3.7.1. Rejects. The WRM/RSP manager reviews rejects for correction and
         reinput. When reprocessing is not necessary, remove and destroy the suspense
         creation sheet.
         2.4.3.7.2. Management Notices. Review management notices for necessary action.
         When excess due-outs result from processing a transfer, request an inquiry of the
         gaining detail record document number. Review the due-outs of the gaining detail
         record for possible cancellation, cancellation and reestablishment under a losing
         detail record, or any additional applicable action.
      2.4.3.8. Document Flow For 1KT
         2.4.3.8.1. WRM Monitor.
             2.4.3.8.1.1. Prepare the necessary 1KT inputs and a suspense file for each.
             (Suspenses are not necessary for manual inputs.) Establish suspense files by
             preparing two copies of the input creation. However, any method consistent with
             good management is acceptable.
             2.4.3.8.1.2. Send the input creation to a terminal operator or Distribution.
         2.4.3.8.2. Terminal Operator/Distribution.
             2.4.3.8.2.1. Input a 1KT by a terminal or send it to Computer Operations.

                         to bases.                be necessary.
Note: The suspension of inbound BLAMES and ES-S incoming transaction processing impacts
the host and all associated satellites so close coordination is required. Satellites experiencing
problems forcing them into degraded operations (including exercises) should notify Host
accounts as soon as possible.
   2.5.3. Base Level Data Required to Support Degraded Operations.
       2.5.3.1. The table below portrays the typical data needed to support degraded operations.
       The LRS CC/AO or equivalent may add or delete products they deem necessary to
       support degraded operations in their organization.
       2.5.3.2. The AFSCDB/NGV301M is the primary source for ES-S record data. However,
       if the AFSCDB is unavailable for more than 48 hours then consider processing
       NGV301M anyway to stage the required data for degraded operations. If neither of these
       options (AFSCDB or NGV301M output) is feasible then legacy reports (either those
       listed or equivalent) must be processed. The CTC will ensure the data required to support
       degraded operations is updated/downloaded at least as frequently as indicated and readily
       available when degraded operations are initiated.

   2.5.5. Degraded Operations Backlog Processing Sequence.
       2.5.5.1. The table below provides the sequence for processing degraded operations
       transaction backlogs.
       2.5.5.2. The sequence of document identifier codes (DIC) and transaction identification
       codes (TRIC) is not all-inclusive. Local discretion should be used to consider local
       conditions and processing restrictions.
       2.5.5.3. If a formal declaration of degraded operations is not made and CT is not
       established, the recovery will be accomplished in TRIC/Date/Time sequence, that is,
       process the transactions in the sequence they were created. When recovering deployed
       transactions, process the transactions in the sequence they were created. The Item
       Record Loads will be sorted as a group and the rest of the transactions will be processed
       as they would have on the mainframe, if one had been available during the deployed
       operation.

Notes:
1. TEX 6 ISU with the same stock number should be processed first.
2. EXTREME CAUTION must be used in sequencing these documents. The following
is recommended:
a. Sort alpha in position 1. This will put the ISU before the TIN.
b. Sort into document number sequence (positions 30-43). This will put each ISU
before its respective TIN.
c. Manually select all TINs which do not have a matching ISU and put them first.
3. TEX 6 for A2x/A4x is only authorized on priority 01-03. TEX 6 must be placed in
position 73 of the A2x/A4x (not in 51 like most transactions).
  2.5.6. Preparation of DD 1348-1A, (ISU/MSI/DUO/DOR/A2x/SHP/A5J Documents).
     2.5.6.1. The DD 1348-1A will be prepared as an auditable document to support asset
     movements during degraded operations. Prepare DD 1348-1A for all degraded issues
     (including MSI), shipments, transfers, and releases. Also prepare this form for repair
     cycle (XD/XF) due-outs. Ensure all documents are annotated with classification and/or
     NWRM in red ink, as applicable. Hand receipts will also be created when applicable.
     Note: If Asset Management is available then document labels can be used for on-base
     movements.
     2.5.6.2. Until more sophisticated tools are available, use either the fillable PDF version
     of DD 1348-1A or equivalent local facsimile (e.g., Excel, Notepad, or Access).
     2.5.6.3. ISU/MSI. Prepare ISU/MSI documents IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order
     and Requisitioning and Ch 5.
         2.5.6.3.1. If the ERRCD of the item is XD/XF, enter DIFM in block C. Enter
         degraded operations in block BB and TEX 6 in position 51.
         2.5.6.3.2. SHP/A2x/A4x/A5J. Prepare SHP/A2x/A4x/A5J documents IAW Ch 5.
         Ensure the following:
            2.5.6.3.2.1. If a document number is not provided when a degraded operations
            shipment is required, the section/element or flight creating the DD 1348-1A
            obtains the next sequential number from the offline Supply Document Register
            maintained by Requirements.
            2.5.6.3.2.2. Ensure that the security classification and controlled item code are
            annotated in block X.
            2.5.6.3.2.3. If the source document contains a fund code in positions 52-53, and
            the MILSTRIP advice code in positions 65-66 is other than 2E, annotate
224                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             REIMBURSABLE in block Y.
             2.5.6.3.2.4. If the mode of transportation is other than consignee pickup, enter the
             national motor freight classification code in block L and the type cargo code in
             block G of the DD 1348-1A.
             2.5.6.3.2.5. If applicable, enter MICAP in block C. When these entries are made,
             the appropriate MICAP identification will be entered in positions 62-64 of the
             output.
             2.5.6.3.2.6. If applicable, enter additional information from the source document
             onto DD 1348-1A.
         2.5.6.3.3. Sensitive Item Receipts. Create a sensitive item handling hand receipt (AF
         Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt) IAW AFMAN 23-122, Ch 2 when the item
         record contains a controlled item code of the following A-H, K, L, O, S, T, Q, R, 1, 2,
         3, 4, or $ (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 para. 5.3.12 for the Classified Hand
         Receipt Output format).

 Note:
 1. Enter an L to load, a C to change, an I to inquire or a D to delete an IRSP detail. A code of R
 indicates a receipt of a transferred IRSP detail. The action code R is placed in the 1LK input as a
 result of processing NGV471 MRSP/IRSP transfer.
 2. Valid TEX codes are 7, P, M, or U. This field is ignored if not used in conjunction with the
 issue flag.
 3. Enter an N to inhibit automatic MSI processing for this individual line item. A Y is stored on
 the detail if no entry is made.
 4. Enter a ( N ), Non Mission Capable or a ( P ) Partial Mission Capable.
 5. The item record of the stock number cannot have a NPPC equal to 3 or 9. It must be an ERRC
 equal to X in the first position.
 6. Enter the system designator applicable to the item record. Mandatory entry on all inputs.
 7. Enter the applicable code to be generated in the ISU.
 8. Enter the SRD of the end item supported by this line item. This is a mandatory entry on loads,
 not required on deletes. Required on changes only if it is changing. There must be an MRSP-
 IRSP-CONTROL record loaded with the same SRD. If data is entered into this field, all other
 changes (except a UTC change) are ignored.
 9. Enter A for RR concept IRSP or B for RRR concept IRSP. Leave blank when not applicable.
 Enter an asterisk (*) to blank this field on a change input.
 10. The document number is broken down as follows:

Figure 2.29. Document Number Construct.
Position 30 = W
Positions 31-33 = ORGANIZATION CODE >099 <999.
Positions 34-35 = SHOP CODE
Positions 36-39 = ZEROS
Positions 40-43 = NUMERICS > 0.
11. Must be numeric and greater than zero when the prime sub flag equals P. Will always be
zero for substitute details (prime sub flag equals S). This field, for loads, contains the total
authorization including both supportable and unsupportable. Authorized quantity can be all
zeroes only when the IRSP wartime requirement is greater than zero.
12. Enter a P when loading a prime detail or an S when loading a substitute detail. If it is
required to change an existing substitute detail to the prime detail, enter the stock number of the
substitute detail and the substitute document number in their respective fields and a P in this
field. The prime will be changed to a substitute and the substitute will become the new prime.
***Changes leave blank unless you are changing a sub to a prime.***
13. Enter the applicable UTC. Mandatory on loads, not required on deletes. Required on
changes only if it is changing. An MRSP-IRSP-Control record must be loaded with the same
UTC. If data is entered into this field, all other changes (except an SRD change) are ignored.
14. Enter the applicable project when the issue program is to be called. Leave blank when the
issue flag is to be left blank.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     237


15. Must equal 1, 2, 3, or 4. This is a mandatory entry on loads. If the note code is 1, 3, or 4,
the percent application must be entered. On changes when 2 is entered, the percent application
will automatically be changed to zeros. Optional for changes, not required on deletes.
16. Enter the applicable logistics increment code. May be blank. To blank this field on a
change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position.
17. Only applies when the action code equals an L. If used it must equal an I. Issue interfacing
instructions: no issue interface will take place for the unsupportable quantity when the
supportability code equals F.
18. Must be Alpha. Cannot be blank when using the issue flag.
19. Must equal numerics and be greater than zero when the note code is other than 2. To blank
this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position. It cannot be blanked if the
note code is other than 2.
20. Must be B, D, or K.
21. Alpha/Numeric. To blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last
position.
22. Numeric. To blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position.
23. Must be numeric and greater than or equal to the authorized quantity. Mandatory if the item
record ERRCD = XD(x). Cannot be zero if the authorized quantity is equal to zero. This allows
an authorized quantity of zero with an IRSP wartime requirement of one or more.
24. May be blank if not loading an unsupportable quantity. On loads of an unsupportable
quantity, must be blank or F. An F is used to identify items not supportable because of base or
command fiscal restraints (no funds available). Leave blank when changing an existing
unsupportable quantity. An asterisk (*) will blank the supportability code and the unsupportable
quantity field.
25. When used, must be numeric. On initial detail loads, its purpose is for issue interface
computations. On loads, this category must have an entry or it will reject.
a. When supportability code equals an F, this field must be 00000 or greater.
b. When making changes to the unsupportable quantity field, input the new quantity. The
program will overlay the existing quantity with this new one. This is a single field. Do not put a
supportability code in on changes unless the unsupportable quantity was previously blank. There
is no issue interface on changes.
26. This will only apply when the action code equals R. The structure of this document number
will be as follows:

   2.6.3. High Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK)/Contingency High Priority Mission
   Support Kit (CHPMSK) Load, Change, Inquire, Delete, And Receipt (1HM).
       2.6.3.1. Purpose. To provide an input to load, change, inquire, delete, and receipt for
       High Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK) details.
           2.6.3.1.1. Requirements.
              2.6.3.1.1.1. Load. Prior to loading an HPMSK detail, a MRSP/IRSP serial
              number record and MRSP/IRSP control record must be loaded for the input UTC,
              SRD, org code, and shop code. The minimum data elements required to load an
              HPMSK detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system designator, SRD,
              document number, authorized quantity, unit type code, prime/sub flag, note code,
              and type spares code.
              2.6.3.1.1.2. Change. The minimum data elements required to change an
              HPMSK/CHPMSK detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system
              designator, and document number. The following fields may be blanked by
              placing an asterisk (*) in the last position of the field: Mission Capability Code,
              Maintenance Repair Concept, Increment Code, Percent Application, Work Unit
              Code, Quantity Per Application, or Supportability Code.
              2.6.3.1.1.3. Inquire.  The only data elements required to inquire a
              HPMSK/CHPMSK detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system
              designator, and document number.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  243


               2.6.3.1.1.4. Delete.   The only data elements required to delete an
               HPMSK/CHPMSK detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system
               designator, and document number. If this input deletes the last detail loaded for a
               MRSP/IRSP control record, the control record will also be deleted.
               2.6.3.1.1.5. Receipt. The minimum data elements required to receipt for a
               transferred HPMSK detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system
               designator, SRD, document number, authorized quantity, unit type code,
               prime/sub flag, note code, type spares code. The shipping document number and
               transferred quantity are programmatically generated at the time of transfer by
               program NGV471.
           2.6.3.1.2. Authorizations. Authorizations are always carried on the prime detail.
           Substitute details are created by other inline programs or may be created with 1HM
           inputs provided a prime detail exists.
        2.6.3.2. Input Restrictions. Terminal or RPS/main system.
        2.6.3.3. Output. The only output generated by this input is management notices, rejects,
        or issue documents. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for applicable notices.

   Delete and Receipt (1NK)
      2.6.4.1. Purpose. To load, change, inquire, delete or receipt for a Non-Airborne Mobility
      Readiness Spares Package (NAMRSP).
         2.6.4.1.1. Requirements.
             2.6.4.1.1.1. load. Prior to loading a NAMRSP detail, an MRSP/IRSP serial
             number record and MRSP/IRSP control record must be loaded for the input UTC,
             SRD, organization code, and shop code. The minimum data elements required to
             load a NAMRSP detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system designator,
             SRD, document number, authorized quantity, prime/sub flag, unit type code, note
             code, and type spares code.
             2.6.4.1.1.2. Change. The minimum data elements required to change a NAMRSP
             detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system designator, and document
             number. The following fields may be blanked by placing an asterisk (*) in the
             last position of the field: Mission Capability Code, Maintenance Repair Concept,
             Increment Code, Percent Application, Work Unit Code, Quantity Per Application,
             or Supportability Code.
             2.6.4.1.1.3. Inquire. The only data elements required to inquire a NAMRSP
             detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system designator, and document
             number.
             2.6.4.1.1.4. Delete. The only data elements required to delete a NAMRSP detail
             are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system designator, document number, and
             Type Spares Code. If this input deletes the last detail loaded for an MRSP/IRSP
             control record, the control record will also be deleted.
             2.6.4.1.1.5. Receipt. The minimum data elements required to receipt for a
             transferred NAMRSP detail are: TRIC, action code, stock number, system
             designator, SRD, document number, authorized quantity, unit type code,

                prime/sub flag, note code, type spares code. The shipping document number and
                transferred quantity are programmatically generated at the time of transfer by
                program NGV471.
                2.6.4.1.1.6. Authorizations. Authorizations are always carried on the prime
                detail. Substitute authorizations are created by other inline programs or may be
                created with 1NK inputs provided a prime detail exists.
        2.6.4.2. Input Restrictions. Terminal or RPS/main system.
        2.6.4.3. Output. The only output generated by this input is management notices or
        rejects. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for applicable notices.

blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position. It cannot be blanked
if the note code is other than two.
20. Enter a T for Temporary MSK. Enter a P for Permanent MSK.
21. To blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last position.
22. To blank this field on a change input, enter an asterisk (*) in the last positions.
23. (A/N).
24. Normally, the following data elements would not be entered into a terminal. When these
details are transferred to another account, program NGV471 will enter this information into the
input along with an action code of R. This will only apply when the action code equals R. The
structure of this document number will be as follows:
Positions 91-96 = SRAN of Losing Base
Positions 97-100 = Date of Shipping Document
Positions 101-104 = Shipping Document Serial Number.
25. This will only apply when the action code equals an R. This field will reflect the actual
quantity that was transferred for this stock number and document number. When processed, this
quantity will be picked up as the on-hand quantity.
26. If applicable, enter the letter A through Z that represents the ISG subgroup that maintenance
has verified as containing the least acceptable item. This field can be left blank
27. Enter the Moving Average Cost (extended cost).
28. Used to bypass 632 REJ notice (Input QTY Plus Sup PT and MSK Auth QTY Exceeds RO).
Under special and temporary circumstances the 632 REJ notice can be bypassed using
transaction exception code “Y” in position 60 of the input of the 1MK. This will load/change the
MSK detail but it will not correct the underlying problem with the RO not being adequate to
cover the requirement so an I140 MGT notice (MSK Auth QTY Exceeds RO) will be produced
when requirements computation is performed on the item. These situations should be monitored
closely and corrected as soon as possible.

             in view of mission requirements. Therefore, detailed drawings/blueprints or
             MIL standard specifications should not be used if commercial off-the-shelf
             products are acceptable and they cost less.
             b. Price. Include the unit price, if known, and an allowable tolerance. This
             data will be used by Base Contracting personnel to ensure that items with
             unacceptably high prices are not used. If the price is not known, enter an
             estimated unit price. Determine whether the customer's price estimates are
             reasonable by comparing them to those for similar items already loaded in
             the account or listed in ML's. This will ensure that proper ERRCD and
             budget code, as well as the proper price, is assigned.
             c. Bench/mockup set. If the form is for a bench/mockup set, list all major

       3.2.1.2. Local purchase requisition coding.         Local purchase requisition (A0*)
       transactions contain specific coding that allows for identification of specific contracting
       offices and purchasing information. Local purchase codes such as: Type Contracting;
       Type of Procurement Instrument; and Vendor are required to further identify specific
       requisitions for items procured locally.
       3.2.1.3. Type procurement code. The Type Procurement Code (Table 3.2) located on
       the ILS-S item record, determines the appropriate routing identifier record to be updated
       when processing requisitions, status, or cancellations.

AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    301


   3.3.1. Receipt Acknowledgement and Follow-Up.
        3.3.1.1. Purpose. To describe the processes and transactions used by the retail materiel
        management process to acknowledge receipt processing and to respond to follow-ups
        from wholesale activities.
        3.3.1.2. Two Processes. The ILS-S acknowledges receipts with wholesale activities
        through two distinct methods.      These methods are the Materiel Receipt
        Acknowledgement (MRA) process and the Receipt Acknowledgement for RAMPS-
        reportable items process.
        3.3.1.3. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement (MRA) Process. The MRA process applies
        to all base materiel receipts (excluding local purchase, local manufacture, lateral support,
        and receipts with serial numbers 9900-9999) regardless of the wholesale source of
        supply. The process uses three transactions: The Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement
        Notice (DRA); the Follow-up to Delinquent Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement (DRF);
        and the Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Reply to Follow-up (DRB). These
        transactions are explained below.
           3.3.1.3.1. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Notice (DRA). The DRA transaction
           is generated by the ILS-S whenever a materiel receipt (REC) transaction is processed.
           The DRA notifies the source of supply when a shipment from a wholesale source of
           supply is received. DRAs are not produced for local purchase (JBB), local
           manufacture (JBD), lateral support (JLS/Dxx), and receipts containing serial numbers
           9900 through 9999.
               3.3.1.3.1.1. Input. See Receipt Input (AFI 24-203, Preparation And Movement
               of Air Force Cargo)
               3.3.1.3.1.2. Output: The DRA will be output through the RPS/main system for
               transmission through DLATS. Table 3.20 provides the DRA output format.

                             discrepant receipt, in which the quantity received
                             does not match applicable status or due-in detail
                             records. DLATS will reject MRA transactions

                             DRA/DRB, RP 25-29) to the reporting activity with a
                             narrative reject stating: “Unit of Issue contains
                             blanks or special characters.” The quantity in RP 25-
                             29 is invalid. Reporting activities will correct and
                             resubmit the DRA/DRB upon receipt of the narrative
                             message reject.

                             based on the TEX code or quantity variation flag and
                             the dollar value of the discrepant portion of the
                             shipment. See Table 3.21.

             3.3.1.3.2. Follow-up to Delinquent Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement (DRF). If a
             Materiel Receipt Acknowledgment (DRA) transaction is not received within a
             specified time, the source of supply sends the base a follow-up to Delinquent Materiel
             Receipt Acknowledgement (DRF) transaction.
                3.3.1.3.2.1. Due-In Check. When a DRF is received and the due-in detail is
                found with a document number matching that of the DRF input, a DRB is
                automatically transmitted from the base to the source of supply. If no due-in is
                found, an I103 MGT notice (Due-in Detail Not Loaded for Input Document
                Number) will be output displaying the input image, ISG number, date of last
                transaction, and system designator. Customer Support must use the I103 MGT
                notice to research the consolidated transaction history (CTH) to determine why
                the due-in is no longer loaded. Once the reason is determined, Customer Support
                will manually format a DRB (Table 3.20) and forward the image back to the
                source of supply.
                3.3.1.3.2.2. Input. Processed via the pseudo reader in the remote processing
                station (RPS). The DRF format is provided in Table 3.22.
                3.3.1.3.2.3. Output. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Reply to Follow-up
                (DRB) will be output for transmittal through DLATS if the due-in detail is loaded.
                If due-in detail is not loaded an I103 MGT notice will output to function 062.

              3.3.1.3.3. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Reply to Follow-up (DRB). A DRB is
              a response to a Follow-up for Delinquent Materiel Receipt Acknowledgment (DRF).
              When a DRF transaction is processed in the ILS-S and the due-in detail record is
              found with a document number matching that of the DRF input, the system produces
              a Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Reply to Follow-up (DRB) transaction to
              provide receipt status to the source of supply. The DRB transaction will also be
              prepared manually in response to an I103 MGT notice.

                       submission.
       3.3.1.4. Receipt Acknowledgment for Recoverable Assembly Management Process
       System (RAMPS)-reportable Items. The process used by the ILS-S to acknowledge
       receipt of RAMPS-reportable items is very similar to the MRA process. However, these
       processes differ in two ways. First, while the MRA process applies to all items receipts
       (with the exceptions noted earlier), the Receipt Acknowledgment for RAMPS-reportable
       items only applies to AF and C-ICP managed items reportable through the D28/NGV868
       RAMPS report (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5). The transactions used to implement
       receipt acknowledgment for RAMPS-reportable items are produced in batch as part of the
       D28 report rather than at the time of receipt.
          3.3.1.4.1. Reporting Transactions. When bases receive reportable items, the ILS-S
          produces and sends D6x (Materiel Receipt, other than Procurement Instrument
          Source) or D4S (Materiel Receipt, Procurement Instrument Source) transactions to
          the AF source of supply. The D6* and D4S transaction formats are provided in AFH
          23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5.
          3.3.1.4.2. Materiel Receipt Follow-up (DXB) transaction. If the source of supply
          does not receive a Materiel Receipt transaction (D6*) within a specified time, the
          source of supply sends the base a Materiel Receipt Follow-up (DXB) transaction.

             Follow-up (7K6) transactions. If the requisition is still due-in at a base, the system
             produces a 7K6 transaction reflecting the quantity still due-in. If the due-in detail
             record does not exist in the ILS-S, the system produces a 7K6 report with zeros in the
             due-in quantity field. The rest of data in this report (except for document identifier
             code, quantity, and date) will be the same data contained in the DXB.

Section 4A—Overview

4.1. Overview. This chapter outlines reference information for materiel management processes
associated with the making and maintaining of materiel. These processes include Repair Cycle &
awaiting parts (AWP). Additional materiel management guidance on these processes can be
found in AFI 23-101 and in AFMAN 23-122.

Section 4B—Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)

4.2. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO).
   4.2.1. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) information. TCTOs are intended to
   expedite the accomplishment of retrofit changes to end articles/items, parts, and materiel
   within specific time periods and reduce the probability of accidents/unreliability of systems
   or equipment due to non-compliance IAW TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance
   Technical Order Process and AFI 21-101 Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
   Management, (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI21-202.pdf).

   4.3.1. Standard DIFM Status Codes.
         4.3.1.1. Purpose. To explain standard DIFM status codes used to reflect the current and
         previous status of the item. The DIFM status code is located on the DIFM detail record
         and is loaded to the DIFM detail record with a DFM input (see Para 4.3.2).
         4.3.1.2. DIFM Status Codes. The status codes in Table 4.1 are used to track items in the
         repair cycle.

Notes:
1        DIFM status codes that count as pre-repair (before) delayed maintenance
         days.
2        DIFM status codes that count as post-repair (after) delayed maintenance
         days.
3        DIFM Status codes that count as repair cycle days.
4        DIFM status codes that count as awaiting part(s) days. See AFI 23-101,
         Sec. 2C, Financial Management for examples of AWP time computations.
5        DIFM status code that counts as repair cycle days for ACC and PACAF
         only. For all others, these codes count as delayed maintenance days.
6        When the first AWP due-out is established, the code on the end item DIFM
         detail record will be changed to AWP under program control. When the
         second AWP due-out is established, the code will change from AWP to
         02P. Subsequent processing will increment or decrement the status code
         counter as appropriate, i.e., sequential processing will result in a code
         assignment: AWP, 02P, 03P, 04P, etc. 03P, 02P, AWP, FWP. DFM inputs
         attempting to change the DIFM status code from AWP or (nn)P will reject
         325.
7        DWO should be assigned to UJC AR/BR requirements when Maintenance
         determines the asset must be retained on the system. This status code
         applies when an asset request for an AWP requirement results in a due-out.
         There will be no status automatically assigned to the DIFM detail that is
         created and Maintenance has 3 days to determine if the reparable asset
         should be removed from the AWP end item for a bench check, or if it is
         more practical to leave the AWP end item on the system and wait for a sub-
         component replacement item. If Maintenance decides to keep the asset on
         the system, they will assign DIFM status code DWO (UJC AR/BR, retained
         on system). If Maintenance decides to remove the asset for bench check,
         normal procedures for local repair or delivery to a central repair facility
         apply.
8        Status code FEM will be assigned when the request has UJC AU, BU, or
         CU, and the delivery destination field contains FEM.
9        When the last AWP due-out is released or canceled, the code on the end
         item DIFM detail record will be changed to FWP under program control.
         DIFM codes attempting to change the DIFM status code to FWP will also
         output a 318 REJ notice (Status Field Blank or in Error). When the status
         of an item changes from FWP, the DFM input must contain a force code (F)
         in position 62 in addition to the new status code. Without the force code, a
         318 REJ notice will occur.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  313


10          LRS/Materiel Management Activity may assign TIN status code when the
            item is in their possession and the turn-in cannot be processed because the
            item record is frozen, an identity problem exists, or similar conditions exist.
            Ensure that processing standards for NRTS code 1 items are adhered to and
            assign a DIFM location code indicating the supply location. All credit
            DIFM details will have status code TIN (Turn-in to LRS/Materiel
            Management Activity ) assigned under program control at time of turn-in.
11          Status code VHM can only be applied against type organization V or T.
12          These codes count as repair cycle days when changed to a repair-type DIFM
            status code.
13          MWI, PDM, TCG, and TOC are considered a separate category of delayed
            maintenance time and stored in the Delayed Other Days field on the DIFM
            detail record.
14          Status code MWP counts as awaiting parts days and must be manually
            updated using DFM input processing.
15          Days are not counted as issued DIFM days when items are in DIFM status
            codes AWP, CTR, DWP, MWI, MWP, PDM, TCG, and TOC.
16          When the DIFM status field is changed to CTR, an I125 MGT notice
            (Contract Repair Only the Quantity Indicated Time XXXX) will be printed.
            This notice will reflect the number of items that should be repaired based on
            the computed requirements. When items are no longer required for base
            support, the number shown in the condemn field of the management notice
            will be for the entire DIFM detail quantity. In this instance, status code
            CTR will not be loaded to the DIFM detail and the items no longer needed
            should be turned in as excess to the base requirements. The TIN
            (transaction identification number) input should have the action taken code
            7 in pos. 62 and TRM in pos. 48-50. When a known requirement exists, but
            it is not apparent from the computed requirement, a force code (F) in
            position 62 of the DFM input will allow status code CTR to be assigned and
            the repair field of the management notice will show the entire DIFM
            quantity.
17          When DIFM status CEH is used the last three digits of the CE work order
            number must be entered in positions 52-54 of the DFM input or reject 429
            will occur.

     4.3.2. Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) Updates.
        4.3.2.1. Purpose. To describe the procedures for updating DIFM records in the ILS-S.
 314                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        4.3.2.2. DIFM Detail Records. Replacement requests using activity code X (Expedite), R
        (Routine), J (Maintenance IT system), or S (Supply Point) with demand codes N, R, T, or
        U will automatically place the removed item under DIFM procedures when the request
        either issues or backorders. (Detailed information on the issue of repair cycle items is
        available in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning)
        4.3.2.3. All issues to Contract Maintenance or in-house repair (activity code C) are
        placed under DIFM control regardless of ERRCD or demand code. A DIFM detail record
        is established in the ILS-S to track the removed item through the repair cycle and to
        ensure that assets are, 1) repaired, 2) evacuated, or 3) condemned, as quickly as possible.
        The status and location of each item will be updated as soon as each applicable
        maintenance activity provides the new information.
        4.3.2.4. DIFM Detail Change Transaction. The DIFM Detail Change transaction is used
        to change selected data on the DIFM and unserviceable detail records. The DIFM Detail
        Change transaction input allows updating of repair shop, location, and status on the
        DIFM detail record. Only memo and firm DIFM detail records (DIFM status flags 0, 1, 3,
        and 4) can be updated by the DIFM Detail Change transaction input. DIFM Detail
        Change transaction inputs will never result in any update to a credit DIFM detail record
        (DIFM status flag 2), since a credit detail indicates the DIFM is no longer in
        Maintenance. Updated data resulting from DIFM Detail Change transaction inputs will
        appear on the next DIFM listing. Note: The date of last change field is updated only
        when the DIFM status field is changed.
           4.3.2.4.1. Input Format and Entry Requirements. DIFM Detail Change transaction
           transactions must be input during inline processing. The DFM input format and entry
           requirements are below.
           4.3.2.4.2. Output. When a terminal is used, I006 MGT Notice (Input Accepted) will
           be printed. This management notice will also contain the phrase NO UPDATE if the
           input did not result in an update to the DIFM detail. Other rejects/management
           notices may also be produced (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 ) for additional
           information on reject and management notices.

Notes:
1. These fields will be left blank unless a change is desired.
2. This data is carried over from the DIFM detail record and has no effect on internal processing.
3. Enter 6-position Deficiency Report number in pos. 45-50. For example, report number 87-1234
would be entered as 7-1234 or 871234.
4. Leave blank unless DIFM status code CEH is used in positions 63-65. For CEH only, enter the
last three digits of the CE work order number from AF Form 1445, Materials and Equipment List
(Approved for EF in WIMS). The last three digits of the work order number must be all numeric or
reject 429 will occur.
5. The input system designator must equal (be the same as) the detail system designator.
6. Input force disposition code D if the DIFM is to be force reported.
7. An asterisk (*) in the least significant character of any of these fields will result in the
corresponding field on the DIFM detail record being blanked.
8. Enter a locally assigned code to indicate the location of the DIFM asset. Normally the
applicable shop code is used for this purpose (for example, HS for hydraulic shop, or HS1, HS2,
etc., when there is more than one hydraulic shop on base). If the item has been turned in to the
Materiel Management Activity, enter a meaningful location to indicate the location of the asset
pending turn-in (for example, FSC for Flight Service Center, INE for Inspection, etc.). If the item
is in Contract Maintenance, enter any meaningful data to identify the vendor/contractor or the
estimated repair date (ERD) using the last three digits of the Julian date.
9. Enter an F to force load specific DIFM status codes as indicated in Para 4.3.1, Standard DIFM
Status Codes.
10. When a change is desired, this field must contain a three position alpha code or a Z in the most
significant character (position 63) followed by two alpha/numeric characters. (See Table 4.1 for
standard DIFM status codes.)
11. This field may be blank or contain a specific DIFM flag. Regardless of the input DIFM flag, a
search will be made, and if any detail can be located (other than credit), it will be updated. Based
on the input DIFM flag, the program will search for DIFM detail records in the following sequence
and update whenever the first equal condition is encountered:
a. Input DIFM status flag is 0, 2, 3, 4 or blank:
(1) Firm DIFM with equal document number.
 316                                                              AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


(2) Memo DIFM with equal document number.
b. Input DIFM status flag 1:
(1) Memo DIFM with equal document number.
(2) Firm DIFM with equal document number.
12. Positions 67-80 are used differently as indicated under the following conditions:
a) For firm DIFM details (DIFM status flag 0, 3, 4) for type organization codes 7, 8, 9, G, I, or V,
positions 74-76 can be used to update the SRD, WUC, or CC on the DIFM detail record. The
change-to data must be entered in the following format:


Figure 4.1. Inputs for DIFM Details (Status Flag 0,3, & 4).
POS    FIELD DESIGNATION

67-73 Blank

74-76 SRD (SRD changes are not authorized against unserviceable detail records).

77-78 WUC

79-80 CC

Note: A DIT input must be processed to update these fields on a memo or credit DIFM detail
record. Updating the mark-for field of the due-out detail record will update the DIFM detail
record at the same time.

b) For activity code C DIFM detail records which were established as a result of processing an
RAR receipt at the repair base, positions 67-80 can be used to enter the RAR due-out document
number as shown in print positions 67-80 of the original issue document. Normally, this field on
the DIFM detail record will not require update unless it was necessary to reverse-post an RAR
turn-in. When a due-out document is loaded to a DIFM detail record in this manner, the RAR
indicator will be set to an R.

c) When disposition instructions have been requested for Deficiency Report exhibits, the report
date will be entered in positions 77-80 to update this data on the DIFM unserviceable detail
record.

    4.3.3. DIFM Penalty Charges.
        4.3.3.1. Purpose. To describe the assessment of DIFM penalty charges.
        4.3.3.2. Penalty Charge. A penalty charge equal to the 022-Markup-Price may be
        assessed to Materiel Support Division (budget code 8) XD2 items that remain in DIFM
        status for over 60 days.
        4.3.3.3. Criteria for Assessment. Budget Code 8, XD2 assets will be reviewed by the
        inline follow-up processing and if the following criteria is met the customer will be
        charged the 022-Markup-Price, a transaction history (TTPC: 7Y, DOCID: 1PU) will be
        created, and the DIFM Status Flag will be changed to a 4.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    317


          4.3.3.3.1. Current DIFM status code is other than MWI, PDM, CTR, AWP, DWP,
          TCG, TOC, or (nn)P.
          4.3.3.3.2. (Current 002-JULIAN-DATE minus 203-ISSUE-DUO-RELEASE-
          DATE minus the 203-AWP-DAYS minus the 203-DELAYED-OTHER-
          DAYS) > 60 days.
       4.3.3.4. Credit Upon Turn-In. When the DIFM item is eventually turned in, credit will be
       granted based on the serviceability of the turn-in. If the item is turned in serviceable then
       the 101-STANDARD-PRICE will be credited. If the item is unserviceable, the 022-
       Mark-Up price will be credited.
    4.3.4. Specifying the Condition of Returned Materiel.
       4.3.4.1. Purpose. To provide a list of the action taken codes used on turn-in requests for
       DIFM items to indicate the actions taken by maintenance and LRS/Materiel Management
       Activity.

AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                            319


           cumulative recurring demands by the
           quantity turned in.
           c. When the item turned in is a Deficiency
           Report exhibit, use supply condition code
           Q and action taken code C. For Deficiency
           Report credit policy, see the materiel
           deficiency procedures.
Notes:
1. Action taken code D is used to indicate an item was 1) bench checked at a
forward operating base, dispersed operating base, or en route base, 2) found
to be unserviceable, and 3) transferred to a main operating base or home base
for repair. If a turn-in input contains a supplementary address in positions 45-
50, action taken code D will cause the item to be shipped to that address. Do
not use code D for turn-in of items with ERRCD XB, and do not use it when
shipping unserviceable items to Inventory Managers, special repair activities,
or other official depot level repair functions.
2. Under the conditions listed below, items turned in with other action taken
codes will be shipped to other Air Force bases and the code will be
automatically changed to D.
a. Override record address. When the override record correlates with the
shipment exception code, the item is shipped to the override record address.
b. Reparable destination address. When the reparable destination/ disposition
code contains an address, the item is shipped to that address.
c. Missing address reject. When the turn-in does not direct a shipment to
another Air Force base, an invalid action taken code reject will be generated.
3. Action Taken Code 8 forces the automatic shipment of items to AFMC
depots. Do not use it with ERRCD XB items; do not use it for shipment to
sources of supply other than AFMC; and do not use it when the Inventory
Manager directs the return of an AWP asset for lack of parts.
  4.3.5. Maintenance Turnaround Processing.
      4.3.5.1. Purpose. To describe the processing of maintenance turnarounds (TRN) and the
      TRN input transaction.
      4.3.5.2. Effects of TRN Processing. Processing a TRN will have the same effect as an
      issue, repair and subsequent serviceable turn-in of a XD*/XF* asset. The TRN will
      update both the demand data on the item record and the repair cycle data on the repair
      cycle record. The fields that will be updated on the item/repair cycle record are as
      follows.
          4.3.5.2.1. Item Record. Number of demands, cumulative recurring demands, and
          DOLD for the item record current period.
 320                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


           4.3.5.2.2. Repair Cycle Record. Number of assets repaired, current quarter net repair
           cycle days, and action taken code for the Repair Cycle Record Current quarter.
           Note: If TRN is used for Supply Point items, then the DOLT on the supply point
           detail record will not be updated.
        4.3.5.3. TRN Data. Data for processing a TRN will be provided to the TRN manager by
        the maintenance activity on AFTO Form 350. The TRN manager will use the AFTO
        Form 350 to prepare and process a maintenance turnaround input.
           4.3.5.3.1. TRN Stock Number. Local quick reference lists may be developed to allow
           for identification of high demand items by the TRN manager.
           4.3.5.3.2. TRN Document Number. The LRS CC/AO must choose from two different
           options for the TRN document number.
                 4.3.5.3.2.1. Option 1 is to use the actual Organization and Shop Code of the
                 maintenance activity in the TRN document number.
                 4.3.5.3.2.2. Option 2 is to use organization code 009 followed by a locally
                 assigned production control identification number in the shop code field. When
                 production control numbers are used, the TRN manager will assign each
                 Maintenance Production Control being supported a number between 01 and 99. If
                 this option is used the TRN manager must ensure that type organization code I is
                 loaded to the OCCR for organization code 009.
        4.3.5.4. TRN Input Format. The TRN input is used to update demand and repair cycle
        data on an item repaired in maintenance but not physically processed through the
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
           4.3.5.4.1. Input Format and Entry Requirement Restrictions. RPS/main system or any
           terminal during normal inline processing. Additionally, TRNs may be processed
           through the maintenance informational system. The input format and entry
           requirements are listed below.
           4.3.5.4.2. Output. If input is through the RPS/main system, an I122 MGT notice
           (Maintenance Turn-Around Transaction Process On) or the applicable reject will be
           output. If the input is through a terminal, management notices I006 MGT and I122
           MGT notice, or an or applicable reject, will be printed back to the input function.

1           Enter either the shop code of the maintenance activity which generated the AFTO
            Form 350 or the shop code of the repair activity in positions 4-5.
2           Part number requests will contain a P in position 8, followed by the 14 most
            significant positions of the part number. If the part number is loaded it will
            convert to the appropriate stock number. The TRN manager coordinates all
            required research by Maintenance (part number) and Supply (stock number) to
            ensure all part numbers are converted to a valid stock number and stock numbers
            are loaded in the computer.
3           Normally, the quantity will be one. Do not combine data from multiple AFTO
            Forms 350 on a single input. If the correct quantity cannot be determined return
            the AFTO Form 350 for completion prior to processing.
4           The document number will be constructed as in Table 4.5.

5           Maintenance Action Taken Code must be A, F, G, K, L, OR Z. The AFTO Form
            350 will be returned to the appropriate maintenance activity if a valid action
            taken code is not entered.
6           Leave positions 65-67 blank unless a 256 reject has been received indicating
            manual computation of net repair days is needed because the repair cycle record
            quarters are blank. When blank, the net repair cycle days will be computed
            programmatically. The net repair cycle days are computed as follows.
                    New current QTR RCT. = [(Sum of 5 quarters RCT divided by sum of 5
                    quarters RTS) times the TRN input quantity] + current QTR RCT
            To manually compute the repair cycle days, multiply the net repair cycle days on
            the AFTO Form 350 by the quantity turned around. Enter the result in positions
            65-67.
            Net repair cycle days divided by the quantity turned around cannot be greater
            than 15 days or less than 1 day. If the correct number of days cannot be
            determined, return the AFTO Form 350 for completion prior to processing.
7           If type organization is V, G, I, 7, 8, or 9, these fields cannot be blank.

       locally determined until TRN processing is verified.
          4.3.5.5.1. Successful Processing. Successful processing of a TRN is indicated by an
          I122 MGT notice. When the I122 MGT notice is received the AFTO Form 350 may
          be disposed of. The I122 MGT notice will be distributed as follows:
              4.3.5.5.1.1. Copy 1--applicable Production Control
              4.3.5.5.1.2. Copy 2--TRN Manager
              4.3.5.5.1.3. Copies 3 and 4--as locally determined.
          4.3.5.5.2. Daily Document Register. The Daily Document Register (D04) may also
          be used to monitor TRN processing. The D04 lists all transactions that processed the
          day before. The AFTO 350 should be compared to the D04 to ensure the TRN input
          has been processed. When this option is used, the TRN manager will retain copy 2 of
          the register, distribute copy 3 to the applicable Production Control, and use copy 4 as
          locally determined.
   4.3.6. Awaiting Parts (AWP) Checklist.
       4.3.6.1. Purpose. To describe and explain the usage of the AWP checklist at base level.
       4.3.6.2. Use of AWP Checklists. The use of an AWP checklist to assist in requesting
       parts and monitoring active AWP requisitions is mandatory. The checklist should be used
       for requesting parts and monitoring active AWP requisitions. The MAJCOM and local
       LRS CC/AO may supplement it.

  4.3.7. General AWP Processing Procedures.
      4.3.7.1. Purpose. This section contains general AWP processing procedures for
      requesting repair parts, mark-for field requirements, serviceability requirements, ILS-S
      associated detail records, and reporting AWP changes.
      4.3.7.2. AWP Responsibilities. The LRS/Materiel            Management      Activity   and
      Maintenance have the following responsibilities:
         4.3.7.2.1. The FSC will:
             4.3.7.2.1.1. Convert requested part numbers to valid stock numbers when
             required publications are available.
             4.3.7.2.1.2. Place customer demands on the ILS-S for repair parts (MAJCOM
             option).
             4.3.7.2.1.3. Store the end-item until all bits and pieces have been received
             (MAJCOM option).
      4.3.7.3. Customer Request for Repair Parts. Organizational requests for bits and pieces to
      repair unserviceable end-items in the maintenance repair cycle will be prepared as
      specified in Para 5.2.1 Use either urgency justification code (UJC) AR or BR, as
      appropriate.
      4.3.7.4. DIFM Detail Record Status Updates. Close coordination is required between
      Maintenance and the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to ensure that DIFM update
      (DFM) transactions are processed as required to update the D23/NGV905 when the status
      of the DIFM end-item changes. See Para 4.3.2 for more information concerning the
      DFM transaction. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more information concerning
      the D23 program. Note: Maintenance organizations must ensure that the correct AWP
      delivery destination is entered in the organization record (OCCR) when AWP repair parts
      are to be delivered directly to maintenance shop holding areas.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               325


     4.3.7.5. ILS-S AWP Processing. Depending upon the transaction exception code (TEX)
     used, AWP customer backorder processing will be as follows for UJC AR/BR. Bases
     submit AWP requisitions for repair parts on a “fill or backorder” basis. The ILS-S will
     automatically assign project code “AWP” to the due-in detail record and generate a
     corresponding requisition A0(*) output transaction with AWP in the project code field,
     and requisition advice code 6L (AFMC-managed). See Ch 5 for more information
     concerning the requisition project code and advice code fields. Note: Repair Cycle
     Support or the AWP monitor, in conjunction with Maintenance, will decide the proper
     action required when unsatisfactory supply status is received for parts to repair cycle
     items containing ERRCD XF3.
        4.3.7.5.1. Mark-For Field Edits. If the customer issue (ISU) input transaction
        contains a blank TEX code, or any TEX code except 4, 6, E or Y, then the input
        mark-for field, positions 67-80, must contain a DIFM or authorized/in-use detail
        record document number. If the detail record cannot be located, the ILS-S will reject
        the issue request. If the DIFM quantity is greater than one, or if more than one DIFM
        detail record is located for the stock number in the ILS-S (such as one firm and one
        memo detail), then the TEX code must be 4 (fill or kill). Once killed, firm customer
        backorder (due-out) records will be established for the repair parts, and DIFM status
        (AWP) assigned to the end-item DIFM detail record.
            4.3.7.5.1.1. When the customer issue request contains TEX E, the mark-for field,
            positions 67-80, must be structured as specified in Para 5.2.11 For example, the
            end-item serial number must be entered in pos. 67-73, the standard reporting
            designator (SRD) in positions 74-76, the work unit code (WUC) in positions 77-
            78, and the command code in positions 79-80.
            4.3.7.5.1.2. When the customer issue request contains TEX code 4, 6, or V, the
            mark-for field is not edited by the ILS-S because customer backorder (due-out)
            records are not created. Additionally, the SRD must be entered in the project code
            field, positions 57-59.
        4.3.7.5.2. Memo Due-Out Processing. When the decision is made to firm up an
        existing AWP memo due-out, the applicable advice code and AWP project code must
        be entered in the special requisition (SPR) transaction. Note: The advice code cannot
        be modified if left blank. Therefore, only the project code can be modified using a
        due-in/due-out update (DIT) transaction. See Para 5.2.71 for more information
        concerning DIT transaction processing.
        4.3.7.5.3. DIFM Status Code Assignment. The ILS-S normally assigns AWP status
        codes on DIFM detail records. The following DIFM status codes will be assigned as a
        result of AWP processing:
            4.3.7.5.3.1. When the first bit and piece AWP due-out is established, status code
            “AWP” will be assigned to the end-item DIFM detail record.
            4.3.7.5.3.2. When the second bit and piece AWP due-out is established, status
            code AWP will be changed to “02P” on the end-item DIFM detail record by the
            ILS-S. When the third bit and piece due-out is established, status code 02P will be
            increased to 03P, etc.
326                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             4.3.7.5.3.3. As bit and piece AWP due-outs due-out release (DOR), cancel
             (DOC), etc., the DIFM status code will be decreased by the ILS-S from 03P to
             02P; from 02P to AWP; etc., on the end-item DIFM detail record.
             4.3.7.5.3.4. When the last bit and piece AWP due-out is released or canceled, the
             ILS-S will automatically change the DIFM status code from AWP to “FWP” on
             the end-item DIFM detail record. Additionally, the DIFM advice code and
             transaction date will be blanked.
      4.3.7.6. AWP Validation Listing (D19) Processing. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
      Function will review Part I of the D19, AWP Validation Listing, to ensure a linked due-in
      exists for each AWP due-out, shipment status or realistic estimated delivery dates, and
      additional or special action follow-ups as required. Note: The applicable AFMC SCM-R
      Stock Control Function may define specific limited actions for the AWP monitor to
      perform such as lateral support or preparation and processing of follow-up transactions.
      See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for D19 processing procedures and output formats.
      Lateral support is authorized for AWP requirements only if it will resolve the AWP
      condition for the end item.
      4.3.7.7. Returning Assets to Serviceable Condition. Both LRS/Materiel Management
      Activity and Maintenance must closely monitor AWP end-items to ensure that assets are
      returned to serviceable condition as soon as possible. As appropriate, cannibalization
      action, local purchase of bit and piece parts, supply difficulty letters, manual follow-ups,
      and lateral support should all be utilized when appropriate. See the AWP checklist in
      Para 4.3.6 for a list of actions that should be taken.
      4.3.7.8. AWP Hold Times. AWP hold times for items not centrally managed by AFMC
      or other DoD agencies will be determined by the base. When establishing local AWP
      hold times, consider the availability of parts, sources of repair, pipeline times, etc. Items
      not centrally managed normally include items coded for local procurement, and items
      procured locally under HQ AFMC contracts for commercial type aircraft.
  4.3.8. Special AWP Processing Procedures.
      4.3.8.1. Purpose. To describe special procedures concerning ILS-S processing and
      management of Awaiting Parts (AWP) customer backorders.
      4.3.8.2. AWP Repair Cycle Item. When a repair cycle item (ERRCD XF/XD) is required
      to repair an unserviceable end-item, process the customer issue request with urgency
      justification code (UJC) AR or BR. The issue request must contain the AWP end-item
      DIFM detail document number in positions 67-80. If other repair bits and pieces are on
      order for the unserviceable end-item when maintenance receives the ordered repair cycle
      item, the maintenance shop scheduler will initiate action to load DIFM status code
      “DWP” on the DIFM detail record of the item received using a DIFM status update
      (DFM) transaction. DWP status indicates the item received is a component of another
      repair cycle item in AWP status. The specific time periods for maintaining items in DWP
      status are the same as those required for items in AWP status. See Para 4.3.1 for more
      information concerning the loading of DWP status on the DIFM detail record using the
      DFM transaction input.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  327


     4.3.8.3. AWP Bit and Piece. If the bits and pieces received are required for an off-base
     activity and extended periods of time (greater than 2 days) are required for delivery to the
     requester, the DIFM detail record for the AWP end-item will be coded “TWP.” TWP
     status indicates bits and pieces required for repair are currently in-transit. The specific
     time period for maintaining an item in TWP status is 10 calendar days plus the AWP
     days.
     4.3.8.4. AWP Requisition Status and Cancellation Codes. The ILS-S will generate a 421
     reject (input must be coded with TEX 9, P, or R)when CB (quantity not available)
     requisition status is received for an AWP requisition, and the status (AE1) transaction
     does not contain transaction exception code (TEX) 9 or R in position 51. See Para 5.2.87
     for more information concerning CB status code processing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
     2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 421 reject.
        4.3.8.4.1. TEX 9. TEX 9 indicates both the due-in and due-out detail records should
        both be canceled. If the input TEX (position 51) equals 9, the ILS-S will internally
        create and process a customer due-out cancellation transaction with maintenance
        action taken code (ATC) B and TEX 9. Note: The cancellation of due-in and due-out
        detail records will not reduce the cumulative recurring demand (CRD) for the repair
        parts cancelled because the end-item has been coded lack of parts (NRTS 4). See
        Para 5.2.100 for more information concerning the due-out cancellation transaction
        input.
        4.3.8.4.2. TEX R. TEX R indicates the due-in detail record should be canceled and a
        new requisition with a new requisition document number should be created for the
        canceled quantity.
        4.3.8.4.3. Assignment of TEX 9 or R. Assignment of TEX 9 or R on AWP
        requisition cancellations will be jointly determined by Maintenance and LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity.
            4.3.8.4.3.1. The fourth line on the 421 Reject indicates the applicable customer
            due-out so that the AWP manager can readily identify the requester.
            4.3.8.4.3.2. If the joint decision is to cancel both the due-in and due-out detail
            records, the AWP manager will advise Maintenance to turn the AWP end-item in
            to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity for evacuation (maintenance action
            taken code 4).
            4.3.8.4.3.3. The AWP manager will enter TEX 9 in position 51 of the requisition
            status (AE1) transaction and reprocess the transaction to cancel the due-in and
            due-out detail records. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more information
            concerning requisition status processing.
     4.3.8.5. Storing AWP End-Items in Maintenance Shops. Each MAJCOM has the option
     of storing AWP end-items in the maintenance shops. The establishment, location, and
     maintenance of AWP suspense files will also be determined by the MAJCOM. The
     LRS/accountable officer is responsible for: 1) requisitioning, 2) lateral support, 3) follow-
     up, 4) monitoring status. LRS/maintenance is responsible for evacuating reparable end-
     items. If the AWP end-item is stored in maintenance shops, the shops will request all bits
     and pieces from the applicable Customer Service function with the appropriate urgency
328                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      justification code (AR/BR) and the end-item DIFM detail document number. A copy of
      the AWP Validation Listing (D19) will be provided to each shop storing AWP end-items
      for the management, monitoring, and processing of AWP end-items. AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
      Pt 2, Ch 5 for more information concerning the D19 program.
      4.3.8.6. Cross-Cannibalization. Both LRS/Materiel Management Activity and
      maintenance shop managers are responsible for reviewing the D19 report to determine if
      cross-cannibalization is possible. Cross-cannibalization of serviceable bits and pieces
      from one AWP end-item to another may serve to repair one or more AWP end items.
      When cross-cannibalization is possible, the maintenance shop is responsible for
      providing the LRS/Materiel Management Activity AWP manager with the end-item
      DIFM document number(s) and the bits and pieces involved. This joint responsibility
      concerning cross-cannibalization ensures the ILS-S contains a record of cannibalization
      actions and the most updated status for each DIFM.
      4.3.8.7. AFMC Directed Evacuation. Regional repair bases (for example, CRFs and
      Primary Supply Points) will be exempt from AFMC directed evacuation because their
      repair need is based on multiple base locations not just the asset position at the regional
      repair base. MAJCOMs will supplement this portion of the manual to indicate bases that
      will be partially or totally exempt from this process because they function as a regional
      repair base. Note: Exemption does not mean that AFMC will not respond to AWP
      reporting, exemption means that XE8 disposition directions from AFMC can always be
      denied. Also normal processing would apply to those accounts identified as exempt to
      include credit determination.
         4.3.8.7.1. When an XE8 is received with AWP disposition code 2 (evacuate) or 3
         (dispose), the disposition code will be stored in the Disposition Response Code field
         (second position of the FILLER-2) of the appropriate DIFM detail. These details will
         be listed on the DIFM-AWP Disposition Report (D41/NGV887). The D41 will be
         made available to the Flight Service Center (FSC) and maintenance for daily review.
         4.3.8.7.2. The FSC and AFMC SCM-R Weapon System/Stock Control Activity will
         review the D41 on a daily basis. The FSC will notify maintenance to turn-in the AWP
         end-item(s) listed on the D41 with disposition code 2 or 3. Maintenance will be
         directed to cease all attempts to repair the asset and turn the asset in within one
         workday. Maintenance will be advised that credit will not be allowed for items on the
         list with disposition code 2 or 3 (regardless of serviceability because the item is
         excess to the base/AF needs) so these items should be evacuated or disposed of as
         directed. Any remaining bit and piece due-outs should be cancelled. Note: When the
         XE8 is initially received an I115 MGT notice (End Item DIFM Disposition Code
         Changed to 2 or 3) will be produced and output to function number 059 (Repair
         Cycle) or if function number 059 is not loaded the I115 MGT notice will output to
         function number 444 (RPS). The I115 MGT notice can be used to provide advance
         notice to maintenance that an AWP end item must be evacuated.
         4.3.8.7.3. Maintenance will use Action Taken Code 8 (bench checked--return to
         depot facility by direction of system manager or item manager) on the unserviceable
         turn-in resulting from AWP disposition code 2. Items with AWP disposition code 3
         will be sent to DLADS.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 329


          4.3.8.7.4. Condition Code F will normally be used on the unserviceable turn-in,
          however, condition code G is authorized if the AWP end-item being evacuated is
          missing components. A complete list of items missing (stock number, quantity,
          ERRCD, and nomenclature) will be annotated on the reverse side of the condition tag
          or on a separate list securely attached to the condition tag. When condition code G is
          used, the FSC (or supply turn-in point) must validate that any ERRCD XF/XD items
          listed as missing were previously evacuated (as indicated by the presence of a credit
          DIFM detail). This is to ensure that these component items are not removed and
          retained prior to turn-in of the end item.
          4.3.8.7.5. When evacuation or disposal is directed, Maintenance is authorized to
          evacuate or dispose of an item in the same Interchange and Substitution group (ISG)
          as the item on the D41. However, any item being turned-in for disposal (disposition
          response code 3) must also be in AWP condition and in the same or less preferred
          subgroup in the ISG. For example, if the directed evacuation/disposal is received on
          an item in subgroup AB, then any other AWP item in the same (AB) or lesser (AA)
          subgroup can be turned-in for disposal, but items in subgroup AC and higher cannot
          be turned in to satisfy the disposal direction. Items turned in for evacuation
          (disposition response code 2) must also be in AWP condition but the subgroup
          restriction does not apply (that is, any item in the ISG, even more preferred
          subgroups, can be evacuated to comply with the evacuation directive). Note: When a
          different item (than the specific one directed) is evacuated/disposed of, additional
          actions are necessary to ensure the AFMC database is updated correctly. In this
          situation, an XE9 denial must be submitted on the original evacuation/disposition
          request. This will ensure that the appropriate suspense record in the AFMC database
          is updated. The actual evacuation/disposition action on the other item will also
          generate a XE7 deletion report to remove its record from the AFMC database.
          4.3.8.7.6. FSC (and all turn-in points) will check all serviceable turn-ins against the
          D41 and if the document number is listed with disposition code 2 or 3 then credit will
          be denied. Use credit code N in position 52 of the turn-in to deny credit.
          4.3.8.7.7. Once the disposition is determined, FSC will input an XE9 with the
          appropriate response (D, S, or E) code. See Table 4.7 for response code definitions.

a. Response Code D = used to decline return or disposal (deny) of the asset.
b. Response Code S = used to confirm disposal of the asset.
c. Response Code E = used to confirm evacuation/shipment (NRTS) of the
asset.
   4.3.9. Base Contract Maintenance
       4.3.9.1. Purpose. To describe the procedures that apply when items require repairs that
       must be contracted for (contract maintenance).
       4.3.9.2. Activity Code C. Any item in stock that requires contract maintenance will be
       issued using activity code C. This type of issue will result in DIFM control regardless of
       ERRCD or demand code. Demand data is not updated when activity code C is used. See
       Ch 5, for the ISU format and processing.
       4.3.9.3. AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. AF Form 9 will be used to process items to
       contract maintenance for repair. The AF Form 9 will include the appropriate fund cite,
       signatures, a suggested repair contractor and a statement that the item will be returned to
       the maintenance activity. A copy of the AF Form 9 will be provided to DIFM monitor in
       the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and the DIFM monitor will change the DIFM
       status to CTR. The maintenance activity will retain a copy of the AF Form 9 in suspense
       until the property is returned. When the item is returned, the maintenance activity must
       verify the condition of the item, prepare an DD 1574, Serviceable Tag-Materiel and turn-
       in the item to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
       4.3.9.4. Non-stock listed (part-numbered) items. When the maintenance activity
       determines a nonstick listed (part-numbered) item needs to be repaired and no repair
       capability exists on base, initiate an AF Form 9. When an AF Form 9 is initiated to repair
       a part-numbered item, LRS/Materiel Management Activity will coordinate with the
       maintenance activity to determine if an AF Form 86, needs to be initiated.
       4.3.9.5. Condemnations. The procedure described for EAID items in Para 5.4.4.12
       (Condemnation or Cannibalization of Equipment on Contract Repair), will be used to
       clear DIFM records for items condemned or cannibalized while out for contract repair
       from Base Contract Maintenance (for example, GSA Federal Prison Industries Tire
       Recapping and Repairing).
   4.3.10. Calibration/Repair And Return Request (RAR).
       4.3.10.1. Purpose. To provide an input format for processing supplies and equipment to
       a repair activity using calibration/repair and return procedures.
       4.3.10.2. Input Restrictions. None.

c. If the project code is 175 (COOL BARGE), or Y31 (PACER GOOSE), enter TEX code X in
position 51 when automatic due-out and requisitioning action are required.
10. The ILS-S will assign the applicable delivery/Supply response priority to output issue
documents (computed with FAD and UND). Higher priority/UND combinations may be
manually processed.
11. The following information applies:
a. If MILSTRIP time frame (days) standards will not satisfy the customer’s requirement, enter
the applicable required delivery date (RDD). If the UND is B or C, the RDD must be greater
than 21 days past which exceeds MILSTRIP standards.
b. If the issue request is for planned requirements that contain unusual lead time, enter an X
followed by the number of months before the property is required.
12. The following information applies:
a. For bases operating under the SBSS/ IMDS CDB /CAMS-FM (G081) interface, the following
fields are mandatory on all issue requests processed on LRS/Materiel Management Activity
terminals with activity code J. The IMDS CDB /CAMS-FM ID must be an alpha character and
the Job Control Number must contain numeric characters in positions 82-86 and alpha/numeric
characters in positions 87-93. Enter this data anywhere in blocks F through I on the AF Form
2005.
b. Use the following serial numbers for the SBSS/ IMDS CDB /CAMS-FM interface to ensure
output information is routed correctly.

Notes:
1. Enter the delivery destination code or leave blank. If left blank, the ILS-S will assign the
delivery destination from the delivery destination field of the organization (518) record.
2. Leave the IEX blank on initial preparation when the requesting activity does not have
assignment /manager responsibility (Para. 5.2.17. ). For a non-expendable item request
initiated by Base Civil Engineer, IEX G may be entered. See Para. 5.2.14. for more
information.
3. Part numbered item customer requests will contain P in position 8 followed by the first 14
positions of the part number.
4. The customer must provide these data. If the request is submitted in a letter or called in,
EAE will enter the applicable data in the required positions of AF Form 2005.
5. EAE determines the activity code through the ERRC and Use Code.
6. For activity code E, the customer provides detail document number if the authorized/in-use
detail record already exists in the ILS-S. The EAE assigns the detail document number for
new authorizations.
7. The work order number must be entered for Civil Engineer request (type organization code
A or B).
8. The following information applies:
a. If the customer request is for serviceable items, enter supply condition code A or leave
blank.
b. If the customer request is for items identified with NPPC 4 (TCTO), enter supply condition
code D.
c. If the customer request is for items identified with NPPC 9 (unacceptable for Air Force
use), enter supply condition code J. Supply condition code J is not authorized for
replenishment issues to detail records.
9. Leave blank unless the FAD of the intended user differs from the FAD of the requesting
organization.
10. If the input issue request is a verified MICAP incident and contains a MICAP reportable
UJC, enter an N in position 54.
11. Project codes will be assigned by the ILS-S to requests for WRM items.
a. If the request is for laundry and dry cleaning equipment (Allowance Source Code 534) and
the TEX code is D, enter 534 or reject 279 will occur (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 ).
b. If the project code is 175 (COOL BARGE), or Y31 (PACER GOOSE), be sure that the
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 339


TEX code in position 51 is an X when automatic due-out and requisition action are required.
12. The applicable delivery/Supply response priority will be assigned to the output issue
document (computed with FAD and UND). Higher priority/UJC combinations may be
manually input when justified to meet mission requirements.
13. This data is optional and may be left blank if not provided by the custodian.
14. The following information applies:
a. If MILSTRIP time standards will not satisfy the customer requirement, enter the customer’s
required delivery date (RDD).
b. If the request is for planned requirements containing unusual lead time, enter X followed by
the number of months before the property is required.
15. For organizations operating under the JOCAS II concept, this field is mandatory on all
customer issue requests. The 12 digit alpha/numeric JOCAS number consists of the Job Order
Number (positions 1-8), and the Work Breakdown Structure (positions 9-12). The JOCAS
number must be entered or a 484 Reject will be produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7
for more information.
16. The following information applies:
a. If required, enter the requisition advice code. See Para 5.2.45 for more information.
b. If the request is for accountable equipment (activity code E), this field must contain one of
the following requisition advice codes if the item is centrally procured by the source of supply
(alpha budget code other than Z): 6J, 6H, 6G, 6R, 6S, or 6E. See Para 5.2.45 for more
information concerning requisition advice codes. If the item is not centrally procured by the
source of supply, enter appropriate requisition advice code or leave blank.
c. If the source of supply is other than AFMC, and the requisition advice code is blank or 6(*),
the ILS-S will assign requisition advice code 2D.
17. If the customer request is for non-accountable equipment (activity code is P), the
applicable authority for issue flag (Para 5.2.6) must be entered unless the item ERRCD equals
NF1.
18. If the TEX code is % (percent), enter a percentage of discount between 01 and 99. See
Para 5.2.11 for more information.


  5.2.3. Issue From Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions and Transaction
  Format.
      5.2.3.1. Purpose. To explain preparation instructions, internal edits, and procedures to
      issue assets from ILS-S Supply Point, MSK, WRM, WRM/In-Use, MRSP, and
      unserviceable detail records.
      5.2.3.2. General Issue from Detail Record Processing. The issue of assets from ILS-S
      detail records requires an Issue from Detail input transaction. See Para 5.2.4 for the MSI
      input transaction format. The issue from detail record input transaction requires the
      following combination of activity code and type of issue codes:
340                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.2.3.2.1. If the activity code in position 30 is C, position 53 must contain M, R, S,
         U, or W.
         5.2.3.2.2. If the activity code is R, position 53 must be E, M, R, U, or W.
         5.2.3.2.3. If the activity code is X or J position 53 must be E, M, U, or W.
         5.2.3.2.4. If the activity code is P, position 53 must be R.
         5.2.3.2.5. If the activity code is S, position 53 must also be S. Additionally, positions
         72-80 must contain the supply point detail document number (Para 5.2.12).
      5.2.3.3. TEX Code. If position 53 contains an R, the TEX code in position 51 must be
      blank, D, or @. All other MSI input transactions must contain a blank or 6 in position
      51.
         5.2.3.3.1. TEX D - This TEX code is used when reimbursement is not required as
         determined locally. Caution: Do not use this TEX unless approval has been provided
         by the Funds Manager.
         5.2.3.3.2. TEX Blank - TEX Blank, upon issue from MRSP detail records, routes the
         output issue documents to the function number identified on the MRSP-IRSP-
         CONTROL record. If the 025-OUTPUT-FUN-NUMBER is blank, the output
         document is returned to the input terminal.
         5.2.3.3.3. TEX 6 – for use with degraded operations procedures.
         5.2.3.3.4. TEX @. TEX @, upon issue from MRSP detail records, routes the output
         issue documents to the input terminal. TEX @ overrides the function number on the
         MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL record.
      5.2.3.4. Automatic Issue of Assets Located on Detail Records. In some cases, the ILS-S
      automatically searches for, and issues, assets from detail records. For expedite and
      routine issue requests, the ILS-S takes the following actions:
         5.2.3.4.1. Mission Support Kit (MSK) and Supply Point Assets. If a routine or
         expedite issue request (activity codes J, R, and X)--other than manual processing
         (TEX 6), TEX code 8, H, or Z cannot be satisfied, the ILS-S will search for
         MSK/supply point details with the requested stock number. If assets are available for
         issue located on MSK detail records (not deployed), or on supply point detail records,
         the ILS-S will kill the unsatisfied quantity and provide an I023 MGT notice.
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity, in coordination with the requesting organization,
         should take action to issue the available assets from the detail records. See AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
         5.2.3.4.2. Mobility Readiness Support Package (MRSP) and In-Place Readiness
         Support Package (IRSP) Assets. In some cases, the ILS-S will automatically issue
         available assets located on MRSP or IRSP detail records. However, all of the
         following conditions must be met:
             5.2.3.4.2.1. The issue request activity code equals X, R, or J.
             5.2.3.4.2.2. The UND is A or B.
             5.2.3.4.2.3. The MRSP or IRSP detail authorize-withdrawal-flag is not set to N.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                341


            5.2.3.4.2.4. The MRSP detail is not deployed.
            5.2.3.4.2.5. The MAJCOM is authorized MRSP/IRSP withdrawal. Note:
            MAJCOMs that are authorized automatic withdrawal of MRSP/IRSP are
            contained on the 025-MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL record. See Ch 2 for load
            instructions.
            5.2.3.4.2.6. The withdrawal will not reduce assets on hand below the required
            percentage fill rate on the MRSP/IRSP control record. Note: The ILS-S will
            issue to zero balance if the input UJC is MICAP and the percent fill is less than
            100% on the MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL Record.
            5.2.3.4.2.7. If all of the above conditions are met, the ILS-S automatically
            formats an Issue from Detail (MSI) transaction to issue the asset from the detail
            record. See Para 5.2.4 for more information and input format for the MSI input
            transaction. The ILS-S continues to process MSI transactions until the requested
            quantity is satisfied. All unsatisfied quantities are killed and an I023 MGT notice
            is provided.
            5.2.3.4.2.8. ISU requests with TEX M can issue from RSP/IRSP kits if all of the
            above conditions are met. This prevents bypassing assets that were receipted in
            between getting the I023 MGT Notice and trying to backorder with a TEX M.
            (Note: This does not apply if assets have been DOR’d to an MSK or Supply
            Point. The request will bypass them and backorder.)
     5.2.3.5. Manual Issue of Items Maintained on Detail Records. Issues of equipment,
     supply point, MSK, MRSP, and WRM items require corresponding ILS-S detail records.
     If the corresponding detail record cannot be located, the ILS-S rejects the issue request.
     If the request is an issue from supply point, MSK, MRSP, WRM/in-use, or unserviceable
     details, the issue input transaction rejects if the requested stock number is frozen for
     inventory or if insufficient quantities are available. If the request is satisfied from an
     unserviceable detail record, the ILS-S rejects the input if the unserviceable detail or the
     item record for input stock number and system designator cannot be found. If the issue
     input transaction activity code is unequal to S, the ILS-S rejects if the input contains
     organization code 005. If the request is for a WRM or MRSP detail record item and the
     detail record contains a least acceptable code, the issue request could result in either an
     issue or backorder depending on the value of the least acceptable code. If the 101-ISG-
     SOURCE code has an equal or greater value than the least acceptable code, the asset can
     be issued. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2F, Readiness Spares Packages and Kits for detailed
     procedures.
        5.2.3.5.1. Issues from Supply Point Detail Records. All issues from supply point
        detail records are considered “over-the-counter.” The recipient’s signature is required
        for all over-the-counter issues from supply point detail records. When a demand is
        placed on the supply point and the item is available, supply point personnel select the
        item from the applicable location and prepare an issue from detail (MSI) transaction.
        The following codes apply to the MSI transaction input:
            5.2.3.5.1.1. Enter activity code C (functional check) or S (supply point) in
            position 30 and S in position 53.
342                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.2.3.5.1.2. Enter the organization and shop code of the requesting activity in
         positions 31-35.
         5.2.3.5.1.3. Enter the next sequential serial number in positions 36-39.
         5.2.3.5.1.4. Enter the supply point item number in positions 40-43.
         5.2.3.5.1.5. Enter the appropriate demand code in position 44.
         5.2.3.5.1.6. Enter the organization code, shop code (supply point number), and
         serial number of the supply point detail in positions 72-80.
         5.2.3.5.1.7. Each supply point maintains a locally-devised serial number log,
         using numbers 0001 through 9999. When 9999 has been assigned, supply point
         personnel start the log over with 0001. The purpose of this log is to assign a
         sequential serial number to the document number date field (positions 36-39) of
         each issue from the supply point transaction. This technique permits multiple
         issues of a single item during one day's processing.
         5.2.3.5.1.8. The ILS-S will return the supply point output issue document (DD
         1348-1A) to the input terminal function if a terminal function is available at the
         supply point. Supply points operating without a terminal function (or a terminal
         function which is inoperative) process issues from the supply point using
         degraded operations procedures (TEX 6).
         5.2.3.5.1.9. When the supply point detail contains a type authorization code D,
         the input MSI transaction must be processed with TEX F (replenishment) in
         position 54. Note: When the input MSI stock number contains a dash two (-2)
         and the replenishment TEX code in position 54 is 4 or V, the replenishment issue
         contains the dash two stock number.     Note: Fast Moving Items. Use TRN
         procedures to record the demand data instead of processing MSI for fast moving
         items from supply points. However, when TRN procedures are used, the supply
         point detail DOLT is not updated.
      5.2.3.5.2. Issues from Mission Support Kit (MSK) Detail Records.              Enter the
      following data:
         5.2.3.5.2.1. Activity code C, X, or R in position 30 of the MSI input transaction.

         5.2.3.5.6. Issues From Unsupportable Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)
         Detail Records.
             5.2.3.5.6.1. Processing issues. Process issues from unsupportable MRSP details
             using TRIC MSI (Para 5.2.4).
             5.2.3.5.6.2. Processing MSI input transactions. Process MSI input transactions
             using the stock number and document number (positions 72-80) of the
             unsupportable MRSP detail. Enter TEX U in position 51 of the MSI input.
      5.2.3.6. Issue Request Input Functions. Customer issue requests may be input at any
      LRS/Materiel Management Activity terminal or the RPS/main system.
      5.2.3.7. Issue Request Output Documents. Customer issue request output (DD 1348-1A)
      documents normally print on the applicable warehouse terminal determined by the
      warehouse location for the item. Under the materiel management IT processing, the
      output issue document will be printed on the 4100 printer or hip printer unless the
      following exceptions are present:
         5.2.3.7.1. If the item record contains a blank warehouse location, the issue output
         document will be returned to the input function.
         5.2.3.7.2. If the request is issued from a supply point, MSK, MRSP, WRM, or in-use
         detail record, the output issue document will be returned to the input function.
         5.2.3.7.3. If the request is for a satellite account, the output issue document will be
         returned to the input function.
         5.2.3.7.4. If the input TEX requires, the DD 1348-1A (output) issue document will be
         returned to the input function. See Para 5.2.11 for more information. Additionally,
         if the input delivery destination contains PIK, an I143MGT notice (Document
         Returned to Input Device) will be produced on the warehouse terminal. Note:
         Degraded operations issue requests do not produce a DD 1348-1A output issue
         document.
      5.2.3.8. Automatic Detail Record Replenishment. An automatic replenishment issue
      occurs each time an issue is made from a Supply Point, MSK, WRM spares, or
      MRSP/IRSP detail record, unless automatic replenishment is bypassed using TEX F in
      position 54 of the MSI input transaction. When stockage conditions permit, multiple
      MSI input issue transactions may be processed on a given item (bypassing automatic
      replenishment), or a consolidated replenishment may be manually processed at the close
      of the processing day.
  5.2.4. Issue From Detail Record Transaction Format.
      5.2.4.1. Purpose. To explain preparation instructions and processing of the issue from
      detail record (MSI) input transaction. The issue from detail record (MSI) input
      transaction is used to issue items from Supply Point, MSK, WRM, WCDO, WRM/In-
      Use, RSP, and unserviceable detail records.
      5.2.4.2. Input Restrictions. None.

AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    347


E - WRM/In-Use
R - Unserviceable
a. If the request is satisfied from WRM detail records, position 53 equals U, W, or E, and
the end-item is MICAP reportable, use the applicable MICAP UJC. See Para. 5.2.9. for
more information.
b. If the end-item is not MICAP reportable, use the appropriate UJC.
8. The applicable delivery/Supply response priority will be assigned to the output issue
document (DD 1348-1A) based upon the assigned FAD and UJC. Higher FAD and UJC
combinations may be used when justified.
9. For bases operating under the SBSS/ IMDS CDB interface, these fields are mandatory
on all customer issue requests processed on LRS/Materiel Management Activity terminals
with activity code J. The IMDS CDB Unit ID must be an alpha character or a 001 Reject is
produced. Enter the current date anywhere in blocks F through I on the AF Form 2005.
10. For organizations operating under the JOCAS II concept this field is mandatory on all
customer issue requests. The 12 digit alpha/numeric JOCAS number consists of positions
1-8 (Job Order Number), and positions 9-12 (Work Breakdown Structure). The JOCAS
number must be entered or a 484 Reject will be produced.
11. If required, enter the requisition advice code. See Para 5.2.45 for more information.
12. If the activity code equals P and the type account code equals E (equipment), enter the
applicable authority for issue flag (Para 5.2.6). No ILS-S edit is performed on authority for
issue flags for ERRCD NF1 items.
13. If position 53 (activity code of detail) equals M, U, or W and the Asset Status Flag
equals P for partial deployment, enter D, or leave blank. Entering D will decrease the
deployed quantity and no entry (blank) will decrease the on-hand quantity.
14. If the customer issue request is from an organization with type organization code 7, 8,
or 9, or the input UJC is MICAP, enter the command code of the possessing command if
unequal to the requesting unit’s command code. Example: An Air Combat Command
(ACC) unit requests an item to repair a piece of equipment belonging to Air Mobility
Command (AMC). Enter command code 1L (AMC) in this field.
15. If the issue request is from a deployed organization (positions 4-6 equal SAM), the first
four positions of this field (positions 124-127) must contain the applicable 8000 series
requisition serial number.
  5.2.5. Common Coding Required For Issue Inputs.
      5.2.5.1. Common Issue Request Coding. Once customer issue requests are received and
      validated by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, completion of the request involves
      a variety of coding to specify: the requesting organization; priority of the request; end-
      item or system; and specific processing requirements or exception processing. The
      following paragraphs explain some of the common coding required to complete customer
      issue requests in the ILS-S.
348                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.5.1.1. Force Activity Designator (FAD). The force activity designator (FAD) is a
      one-position numeric character that may be entered on customer issue requests. The
      FAD signifies the relative order of importance of a supported organization requesting
      supplies and equipment items. Additionally, the ILS-S uses the FAD, in conjunction
      with the Urgency of Need Designator (UND), to determine the priority designator
      assigned to output requisition transactions used for customer backorders. The HQ
      USAF Program Document (short title PD) is the authority for FAD assignment for
      Air Force organizations, sections/elements, activities, and/or projects. See Para 5.2.7
      for more information concerning the assignment and use of FAD codes on customer
      issue requests.
      5.2.5.1.2. Urgency of Need Designator (UND). The UND is used to express varying
      degrees of urgency when operational effectiveness is impacted due to non-availability
      of requested materiel. In other words, the UND describes if the lack of materiel
      causes; mission impairment, mission prevention, work stoppage, work slow-down, or
      little impact at all. The UND is expressed in the first position of the Urgency
      Justification Code (UJC). Note: Three of the six UNDs will produce MICAP report
      transactions for backorders. See Para 5.2.8 for more information concerning the
      assignment and use of UNDs on customer issue requests.
      5.2.5.1.3. Urgency Justification Code (UJC). The UJC is a two-position combination
      that identifies the UND for the customer and the specific type of requirement
      (justification) or end-item. Standard Air Force UJCs have been established for all
      customer issue requests. See Para 5.2.9 for more information concerning the
      assignment and use of the UJC on customer issue requests.
      5.2.5.1.4. Demand Code. The demand code determines whether the requested items
      will be required by the customer on an initial, recurring, or non-recurring basis. This
      determination is very important because the ILS-S uses the results in the creation and
      modification of demand-based stock levels. The inappropriate use of demand codes
      can result in the creation of excess or insufficient base stock levels. For example, if
      the customer requests the same items on a recurring basis, the LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity will store the demand data and stock the item for future
      requirements accordingly. Conversely, if the item is required by the customer as a
      onetime, non-recurring need, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity would not stock
      the item since it may never be required by the customer in the future. The demand
      code is only one of many variables used in the creation of demand-based stock levels,
      but is one of the most important. In some cases, the demand code also determines if
      due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM) detail establishment and control is warranted. See
      Para 5.2.10 for more information concerning the assignment and use of demand
      codes on customer issue requests.
      5.2.5.1.5. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code. TEX codes are used to identify
      specific situations or exception processing required on customer issue requests. TEX
      codes cover a wide array of processing topics such as reimbursement, automatic
      replenishment, requisitioning, backorders, substitute item issues, fill or kill
      processing, degraded operations processing, and printing of output DD 1348-1A issue
      documents. See Para 5.2.11 for more information concerning the assignment and use
      of TEX codes on customer issue requests.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               349


        5.2.5.1.6. Mark-For Field. The mark-for field is used for a variety of purposes on
        customer issue requests. Mark-for requirements are normally based upon the type of
        maintenance organization and/or the type of item being requested. The mark-for is
        also used to further identify and specify end-item applications. Examples of mark-for
        requirements are: tail number; standard reporting designator (SRD); job order
        number (JON); individual name; warranty date; work unit code (WUC); and vehicle
        registration number. See Para 5.2.12 for more information and processing
        instructions concerning mark-for requirements on customer issue requests.
     5.2.5.2. ILS-S Processing of Customer Issue Requests. All customer issue requests are
     edited for completeness and correctness by the ILS-S. Numerous edits are applied
     including: available assets; master and interchangeable assets; different units of issue;
     activity codes; document numbers; etc. ILS-S processing edits are also based upon
     whether the assets are warehoused or located on detail records as follows:
        5.2.5.2.1. Issue of Stocked Items in Warehouse Locations. Under normal conditions,
        the ILS-S will issue the number of items for the requested stock number to the
        customer if assets are available, and no other exception processing is required.
        However, there are conditions where the system will issue other than requested assets
        when requested assets are not available, and other acceptable assets exist. If customer
        issue requests can be satisfied from stocked (warehoused) items, a customer issue
        request for expendable or non-expendable item (ISU) transaction must be prepared
        and processed in the ILS-S. See Para 5.2.13 for more information and processing
        instructions concerning ILS-S processing of customer requests for warehoused assets.
        5.2.5.2.2. Issue of Items Managed on ILS-S Detail Records. In some cases, available
        assets may be managed on, and issued from, ILS-S detail records such as; MSK,
        MRSP, IRSP, or Supply Point detail records. When detail record items are the only
        assets available for issue, the item(s), and based upon the priority of the customer
        request, two results are possible. First, items may be turned into the LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity for subsequent issue to the customer by processing a turn-in
        transaction. Second, under certain conditions, the ILS-S will automatically issue
        items directly from detail records. To manually issue items from ILS-S detail
        records, an issue from detail record transaction must be prepared and processed in the
        ILS-S. See Para 5.2.3 for more information concerning automatic and manual issues
        from ILS-S detail records. See Para 5.2.4 for the issue from detail record input
        transaction format and processing instructions. Note: Unless overrides are applied,
        issues to replenish detail record balances are automatically processed by the ILS-S.
        See AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5.
     5.2.5.3. Customer Issue (DD 1348-1A) Output Document. When customer requests are
     satisfied via the issue of available assets in the ILS-S, whether from warehouses, detail
     records, or for an already established customer backorder, an output issue document is
     produced. The output issue document (DD 1348-1A) is primarily used to pull the item
     from LRS/Materiel Management Activity stocks, identify special processing
     requirements, obtain signatures confirming customer receipt, and satisfy audit trail
     requirements. See Para 5.2.15 for the DD 1348-1A issue document output format. See
     Para 5.2.16 for more information concerning DD 1348-1A document flow and
     processing instructions.

       5.2.5.4. Common Issue Processing Management Notices.             During issue request
       processing, the ILS-S may provide management notices to assist in the completion of the
       customer request. Common management notices produced from issue processing
       include: other available assets; memo backorder (due-out) establishment; exception
       processing requirements; requisitioning actions; and successful issue completion. See
       Para 5.2.17 for output formats and processing instructions for common customer issue
       request management notices.
       5.2.5.5. Financial Error Correction for Customer Issue Requests. During issue
       processing in the ILS-S, it is possible for requesting organization financial accounts to be
       overcharged or undercharged. This normally occurs when item costs have been
       erroneously assigned or changed on ILS-S item records. Customers should check the
       Daily Document Register (D04) and PFMR/OCCR Update and Reconciliation Listing
       (D11) daily to detect financial errors. See AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for additional
       details concerning D04 and D11 reports. When financial errors are discovered, and the
       customer is not at fault, the customer may request record reversal action to correct the
       error. After record reversal processing has occurred, the item will be re-issued to the
       customer with the correct price. See AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more
       information concerning record reversal transaction processing. Note: Record reversal is
       limited to financial errors detected in the current fiscal year.
       5.2.5.6. Customer Issue Request Exception Processing. There are items and situations
       where special materiel handling or management attention is required to successfully
       fulfill customer issue requests. The ILS-S uses issue exception (IEX) codes to: identify
       special conditions required; control the issue of certain items; ensure limited stocks are
       used to the best advantage; retain certain items required for stand-by specific positions;
       and to advise when additional processing must be accomplished. See Para 5.2.14 for a
       list of approved issue exception codes and processing instructions.
   5.2.6. Authority For Issue Flag.
       5.2.6.1. Purpose. To identify and describe the one-position authority for issue flag. The
       authority for issue flag must be entered on customer issue requests for non-accountable
       (activity code P) equipment items, unless the ERRCD equals NF1.

    5.2.7. Force Activity Designator (FAD).
       5.2.7.1. Purpose. To explain the Force Activity Designator (FAD) on customer issue
       requests. The FAD is also used in combination with the UND to determine the priority
       designator to be assigned on requisition (A0(*)) transactions. See Para 5.2.90 for more
       information.
       5.2.7.2. FAD Authority and Assignment Rules. The HQ USAF Program Document (PD)
       is the authority for the assignment of FAD codes for initial and future requirements of Air
       Force sections/elements, activities, and projects. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for
       more information concerning FAD code load, change, and delete on organization records.
          5.2.7.2.1. FAD Override Option. If the requesting organization is an Air Force
          activity and the requested item will be used in direct support of an organization
          containing a higher FAD, the FAD of the organization being supported should be
          used. This is called the “FAD override” option. Note: The FAD override option
          should be used as sparingly as possible, since the higher FAD equates to a higher
          requisition priority if the request must be backordered. Therefore, FAD overrides
          should only be used for special emphasis programs listed in the HQ USAF PD and
          not for routine administrative support.
          5.2.7.2.2. When supported organizations containing a higher FAD are not supported
          by the requesting organization on a predominant, continuing basis, the FAD override
          option should only be used on a case by case customer request basis.
          5.2.7.2.3. When supported organizations containing a higher FAD are supported on a
          routine, continuing basis, but not predominantly, a separate organizational cost center
          record (OCCR) should be established for the supported organization containing the
          higher FAD.
 352                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


          5.2.7.2.4. When supported organizations containing a higher FAD are predominantly
          supported on a continuing basis, the higher FAD will be loaded to the existing OCCR
          of the requesting organization.
          5.2.7.2.5. If the FAD is blank on the customer issue request, the ILS-S will assign the
          FAD from the applicable organization (518) record.
    5.2.8. Urgency of Need Designator (UND)
       5.2.8.1. Purpose. To explain the one-position alpha/numeric character used to express
       varying degrees of urgency on customer issue requests. The UND is used to express
       situations when operational effectiveness is jeopardized due to materiel non-availability.
       Additionally, the UND is also used, in conjunction with the FAD code, by ILS-S
       requisitioning programs to determine requisition priority.
       5.2.8.2. UND Assignment Rules. The UND is contained in the first position of the
       urgency justification code (UJC). See Para 5.2.9 for applicable UJCs. For a more
       detailed discussion of existing UNDs, see DoD 4140.1-R.
       5.2.8.3. UND Assignment and Usage. Assign the UND to customer issue requests as
       described in Table 5.8

Table 5.8. UND Assignment and Usage.
UND        Assignment and Usage
A          Use UND A on customer issue requests and backorders when continued
           materiel non-availability prevents an Air Force organization/activity from
           performing its combat/support missions or tasks, or training for such missions
           or tasks. The commanding officer of the supported organization will be
           responsible for ensuring the urgency of the requirement is commensurate with
           assigned mission objectives. Requests for items supporting MICAP reportable
           weapon systems or end-items will be backordered as MICAP (UND 1, J, /) or
           as a delayed discrepancy (UJC BQ), except time change/TCTO requirements.
           Additionally, UJC AA, AZ, and AW will not be used for backorders against
           aircraft tail numbers or end-items containing a MICAP reportable SRD. See
           Para. 5.2.23. for more information concerning MICAP customer backorders. If
           UND A is assigned, be prepared to justify its usage.
1          Use UND 1 on customer backorders when lack of the requested item prevents
           primary mission accomplishment because the end-item is not operationally
           ready, out-of-commission, or inoperative. Backorders containing UND 1 will
           produce a MICAP report with MICAP condition codes E, G, K, P, U, V, or W
           if the requested item contains a MICAP-reportable SRD. The ILS-S converts
           UND 1 to UND A for determining the appropriate requisition priority on
           customer backorders. If UND 1 is assigned, be prepared to justify its usage.
J          Use UND J on customer backorders when lack of the requested item impairs
           primary mission accomplishment because the end-item is not fully equipped or
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     353


            is operating in a limited or restricted capacity. Backorders containing UND J
            will produce a MICAP report with MICAP condition codes F, L, or R if the
            requested item contains a MICAP-reportable SRD. The ILS-S converts UND J
            to UND A for determining the appropriate requisition priority on customer
            backorders. If UND J is assigned, be prepared to justify its usage.
/ (Slash)   Use UND / (Slash) on customer backorders when the requested item is required
            to satisfy a MICAP requirement caused by battle damage. Backorders
            containing UND / will produce a MICAP report with MICAP condition code M
            if the requested item contains a MICAP-reportable SRD. The ILS-S converts
            UND / to UND A for determining the requisition priority on customer
            backorders. Note: UND / is only authorized when the MICAP condition was
            caused by hostile actions. If UND / is assigned, be prepared to justify its usage.
B           Use UND B on customer issue requests and backorders when lack of the
            requested item impairs an Air Force organization/activity from performing
            assigned combat/support mission or tasks. Additionally, use UND B when
            training for such missions and tasks can be accomplished, but with decreased
            effectiveness and efficiency. To determine effectiveness and efficiency,
            consider alternatives such as feasible work-arounds, emergency procedures,
            controlled cannibalization, equipment redundancy, modification of equipment,
            use of substitute items, etc. Note: UND B may also be assigned when an
            organization/activity anticipates that materiel deficiencies will prevent
            performance of assigned missions or tasks, if materiel is not available during
            the following time frames:

            Organizations assigned FAD I, II, or III:

            CONUS: Days 8-11 (inclusive)

            OCONUS: Day 13-16 or day 18-21 (inclusive) (depending on geographical
            area)

            Organizations assigned FAD IV or V:

            CONUS: Day 12-24 (inclusive)

            OCONUS: Day 17-52 or day 22-92 (inclusive) (depending on geographical
            area)
C           Use UND C on customer issue requests and backorders when another UND
            does not qualify for assignment. Use UND C on customer issue requests and
            backorders for stock replenishment actions, initial lay-ins, etc.

   5.2.9. Urgency Justification Code (UJC).
        5.2.9.1. Purpose. To explain the two-position alpha/numeric urgency justification code
        (UJC) assigned to customer issue requests. The UJC combines the customer urgency of
        need (UND) and type of requirement (justification) as described below.
        5.2.9.2. MICAP UJC Assignment Rules. When MICAP customer issue requests are
        verified for backorder, the first position of the UJC (UND) will be replaced with the
        applicable MICAP UND (1, J, or /). Once replaced, the ILS-S will create a MICAP
        report (B9M) transaction with a corresponding MICAP condition code as listed below.
        5.2.9.3. MICAP Required Delivery Date (RDD) Assignment Rules. Assign MICAP
        required delivery dates as defined in Table 5.10
        5.2.9.4. UJC Assignment and Usage. Assign UJCs as described in Table 5.9.

Notes:
1. UJC AK and BK are assigned only by HQ AFMC activities containing 20 or 23 series SRANs
(except 2300).
2. Submit customer issue requests for new or increased pre-positioned WRM requirements using
UND C. If an overriding operational situation justifies immediate supply support, the using
MAJCOM may authorize the use of UND B.
3. UJC AV and BV are assigned when circumstances such as unit activation, deployments, etc.,
dictate the use of priority requisitioning to obtain equipment, and when the lack of requested items
would prevent or impair the accomplishment of the unit's mission.
4. Assign FAD 3 for DC conditions. When backordered, UJC AZ creates a priority 03 requisition
and UJC BZ creates a priority 06 requisition.

 Notes:
 1. CONUS activities scheduled for overseas deployment are authorized to enter 999 in
 positions 62-64 of MICAP requisitions. Process the customer issue request with the
 appropriate MICAP UJC in positions 65-66, 999 in positions 62-64, and TEX 7 in position 51.
 The requisition will be prepared offline.
 2. The RDD on MICAP requisitions (positions 62-64) and due-in detail records for CONUS
 bases will contain NA in the first two positions followed by the last position of the UJC. For
 example: NAA identifies a 1A UJC. When the source of supply is other than an Air Force
 depot, the first position will contain an N followed by two zeros.
 3. For OCONUS bases, the RDD on due-in detail records and MICAP requisitions will
 contain the same information as CONUS bases.
   5.2.10. Demand Code.
       5.2.10.1. Purpose. To explain the one-position demand code assigned to customer issue
       requests. Demand codes determine if customer demands will be captured and recorded in
       the ILS-S for computing demand-based stock levels. The demand code also determines,
       under certain situations, whether DIFM control will be established.

                        LRS/Materiel Management Activity;
                        consequently, demand data are not
                        updated on the item record and DIFM
                        control is not established.
C         CONTRACTOR    Description: A request from a
                        contractor for items required in support
                        of authorized contracts. This code is
                        used only when it is anticipated that a
                        like item will not be returned. Effect:
                        Contractor support issues will not
                        update the item record demand data
                        and DIFM control is not established.

                        unserviceable or condemned. Used for
                        items commonly required in day-to-day       See Note 7 for
                        operations which may be requested in        examples.
                        the future. Effect: Recurring demand
                        codes will update the item record date
                        of first demand (if blank), date of last
                        demand, number of demands,
                        cumulative recurring demands, and
                        establish DIFM control. These demand
                        codes also update repair cycle
                        record/repair cycle data when the
                        removed item is returned from
                        maintenance shops.

                        anticipated to be non-repetitive. Effect:
                        Nonrecurring demands are not                See Note 8 for
                        considered as demands against               examples.
                        LRS/Materiel Management Activity;
                        consequently, demand data are not
                        updated on the item record. This
                        demand code will establish DIFM

                                 cycle data on the repair cycle record.
                                 These demand codes will be used on all
                                 issues to supply point, MSK, and
                                 MRSP details.

             System                                      accountability documents (for example,
                                                         DD 200, Financial Liability Investigation
                                                         of Properly Loss, IAD, etc.).
Notes:
1. The following information applies:
a. If it is determined to phase out items in stock due to lack of use or end-item phase-down, assign
demand code N to all issue requests.
b. If munitions (CAD/PAD) items are requested, assign demand code N.
2. Assign the demand code as follows:
I - Initial Issue
J - Initial Issue--Training Aids.
K - Initial Issue--Special Projects.
L - Initial Issue--Assembly/Disassembly.
M - Initial Issue--Mockup/Test Stand.
N - Initial Issue--All other.
3. Demand code T and U are restricted to ICBM maintenance organizations.
4. The following information applies:
a. If the customer issue request is ultimately backordered, and the ILS-S produces a requisition
(A0(*)) transaction, the issue request demand code is converted to the requisition demand code. See
Para 5.2.10 for more information.
b. If the request is for inactivated items, demand code I is assigned. This demand code will be
entered only in requisition (A0(*)) transactions applicable to inactivated items by the DLA
Transaction Service (DLATS). See DLM 4000.25-1-M.
c. If the request is for equipment, assign the demand code as depicted in Table 5.12.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  363


5. If demand code I is used on an issue request to replenish a supportable MRSP detail record, any
quantity available above the requisitioning objective will be issued. Any remaining unfilled
quantities will be backordered. If the issue request is to replenish unsupportable MRSP detail
records, the requirement is always backordered.
6. Examples of initial requests are: requirements for initial shortages; items to be installed in bench
test sets/mockups; items lost in flight, fire, or crash; TCTO kits; and bits and pieces to build TCTO
kits. The establishment or increases to authorized quantities for WRM, MRSP, and IRSP detail
records are also included in initial requirements.
7. Recurring requests include issues for normal day-to-day operations including maintenance, time
change requirements, and equipment items for which replacement is anticipated. Recurring requests
are used for any item for which a continuing requirement is expected to exist. Recurring requests
may also be used for regularly scheduled transient flights.
8. Non-recurring requests include items issued to perform modification, replacement items in kits
with a newer item (retrofit), and requests for non-regularly scheduled transient aircraft support when
the item requested is not common to the system supported by the base.


  5.2.11. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code.
      5.2.11.1. Purpose. To describe the TEX code and the effect each code has on customer
      issue requests. Dual TEX code usage combines two or more TEX code functionalities as
      described below. Note: Use of the dual TEX codes has the same effect on issue
      transaction processing as the normal TEX code, except that the DD 1348-1A (output
      issue document) will be printed on the input terminal.
      5.2.11.2. Funds Availability Edits. Funds availability edits are not performed by the
      ILS-S when the: item’s budget code is other than 8 or 9; backordered assets are stored on
      Supply secondary or detail records; TEX on the issue request equals D (free) or 6 (done
      using degraded operations procedures); supported organization code equals 002, 004,
      005, 010; routing identifier code (RIC) equals HR1 or JBR; urgency of need designator
      (UND) equals 1 (except 1T), J, or / (slash) (MICAP). Note: If sufficient funds are not
      available to cover the total cost of the backorder, a 907 reject is produced. See DFAS-DE
      7077.10-M for more information and correction procedures. For financial error
      correction on customer issue requests, refer to Para 5.2.1.4.5
      5.2.11.3. TEX D or R Usage. To establish a customer backorder with no charge for an
      AFMC-managed (budget code 8 only) item, process the customer issue request with TEX
      D or R. If the budget code is other than 8, a 279 reject is produced. Note: The 279
      reject is not produced for laundry and dry cleaning equipment if allowance source code
      (ASC) 534 is used in the input project code field. The use of TEX D or R is restricted
      and must be used according to Air Force policy instructions. The SMAG Manager at
      each base determines validity of TEX D or R customer requirements. When free issuing
      any budget code 8 items the SMAG manager must notify HQ AFMC/A4YF for approval.

B        S       REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRED. This TEX code is used as
                 determined locally and/or by the MAJCOM to identify those issue
                 requests by non-tenant organizations that require reimbursement. (See
                 Note 2)
C        NA      SUBSTITUTE ISSUE. This TEX code is used to issue a different
                 (substitute) NSN to a detail record such as MRSP, IRSP, WRM, and
                 Supply Point.
D        R       REIMBURSEMENT NOT REQUIRED. This TEX code is used as
                 determined locally to identify those issue requests that do not require
                 reimbursement; i.e., redistribution of excesses, etc. In other words, this
                 TEX code is used for the free issue and free backorder/DOR of selected
                 items. The use of TEX D pertains to activity code X, R, J, and D issue
                 requests only. Do not use TEX D without the approval of the SMAG
                 Manager. The SMAG Manager is responsible for the complete review of
                 TEX D issues and due-outs. For AFMC-managed (budget code 8) items,
                 the Funds Manager must receive a list of selected items identified as non-
                 reimbursable from an appropriate higher authority; i.e., MAJCOM, PM,
                 or the Air Staff and ensure HQ AFMC/A4YF is provided the list. Using
                 a TEX D to create a “free” due-out for budget code 8 items allows for the
                 requisition to be automatically created. To ensure that only approved
                 items are processed with TEX D, the Funds Manager will review the
                 Base Supply Surveillance Report (D20), Part One, Free Issue and Credit
                 Code Y Turn-ins. If there are free issue transactions appearing on the
                 D20 that were not authorized, each free issue transaction will be record
                 reversal and reprocessed without TEX code D.
E        NA      NO END-ITEM DOCUMENT NUMBER ON AWP REQUEST.
                 Normal mark-for field edits apply.
F        NA      ISSUE FROM DETAIL WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT. Do not
                 replenish the supply point, MSK, WRM, or MRSP detail.
G        NA      DO NOT REQUISITION. Suppress other asset notice (Processing will
                 be the same as TEX code 7.)
H        NA      DO NOT ISSUE, DO NOT REQUISITION, ESTABLISH DUE-OUT.
                 Due-out will be established, assets will not be issued, and requisition
                 action will not be taken. The due-out will be un-obligated until
                 requisitioned from other than a free source of supply. This code is
                 restricted to DLADS withdrawals, chemical warfare gear, unfunded
                 mobility supplies and equipment, and CEERS L and P equipment

              F, except that the ILS-S will automatically interface with the FSP

              Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG) manager who must get
              approval from HQ AFMC/A4YF. Using a TEX R creates a “free” due-
              out for budget code 8 items without creating a requisition.
R      NA     ISSUE FROM SUPPLY POINT DETAIL. This code applies only to
              supply point details for type account code K, type authorization codes C,
              I, P, S, T, or Z, non-additive details. Processing is the same as a blank
              TEX code, except that the ILS-S will automatically interface with the
              FSP program to reduce the authorized quantity on the supply point detail
              by the quantity in the MSI.
T      NA     ISSUE REQUESTED STOCK NUMBER ONLY. When used, the ILS-
              S bypasses the ISG group and only the requested stock number requested
              will be issued or backordered. When the customer issue request input
              results in a backorder (due-out) of an item that contains a relationship
              code of M or I, an F017 MGT notice (Item Requested Not Fully
              Interchangeable) will be produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7
              for processing instructions.
U      NA     DO NOT ISSUE. Establish customer backorder (due-out) for
              unsupportable code MRSP/IRSP requirements only.

W     NA   Degraded Operations. Same as TEX code 6, with the exception that the
           ILS-S-generated requisition date (at time of processing instead of the
           document number date) is assigned to the ISU/DOR field on the DIFM
           detail. TEX code W is applicable only to MSI input transactions.
X     NA   SHIP TO SUPPLEMENTARY ADDRESS. When TEX X is used in
           support of project COOL BARGE (175) or PACER GOOSE (Y31), the
           project code must be 175 or Y31 if automatic due-out and requisitioning
           are required. For other uses when TEX X is contained in the due-out
           detail, the requisitioning programs will place the first six positions of the
           organization title in the supplementary address of the due-in detail and
           requisition.
Y     NA   COMBINATION TEX E, 5, AND 7. Do not requisition. Disregard edits
           for end-item document number and reasonable quantity.
Z     NA   DO NOT ISSUE, DO NOT REQUISITION, ESTABLISH MEMO
           DUE-OUT. This code will be used to establish an obligated memo due-
           out. On-hand quantities will be issued/released only when the specified
           due-in linked to the due-out is received. Note: When an off-base
           supply point issue request is processed and the type authorization on the
           supply point detail record equals D, TEX Z will establish a linked due-in
           detail record and direct shipment to an off-base supply point.
1     NA   DO NOT REQUISITION OR AUTOMATICALLY RELEASE DUE-
           OUT. Same as TEX 7. In addition, the due-out release programs will
           not automatically release due-outs.
2     K    DISREGARD AUTHORIZED VS ON-HAND QUANTITY EDITS ON
           ISSUE TO SUPPLY POINT, MSK, WRM, OR MRSP. (See Note 2)
3     NA   BYPASS FUNDS AVAILABILITY ON THIS REQUEST. Do not use
           this TEX code without prior approval of the budget officer. See AFH
           23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for reject 907.
4     V    FILL OR KILL. Used on priority issue requests for any quantity not
           filled. Demand data are not updated for the killed portion of the issue
           request. Activity codes C and L are not authorized to use this code. (See
           Note 2)
6     NA   Degraded Operations. For the input stock number and system
           designator, the total balance must be sufficient to process the input
           quantity, or the request will produce a 290 reject. Reject 290 will freeze
           the item records of the input stock number and system designator with
           freeze code I. Transactions done using degraded operations procedures
           should be held to an absolute minimum since they increase the possibility
           of errors and warehouse refusals.
7     P    DO NOT REQUISITION. If the request cannot be filled and results in a
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   367


                   due-out, the due-out will be memo and requisitioning action will not be
                   taken. The ILS-S will bypass authorized quantity edits when used on
                   issue to WRM or MRSP details. (See Note 2)
8        NA        DO NOT ISSUE. Establish a due-out and disregard reasonable quantity
                   edit. If type account code is B, a firm obligated due-out will be
                   established and requisitioning action taken. If type account code is E and
                   the item record budget code is Z or 9, a memo unobligated due-out will
                   be established. No requisitioning action will be taken. If type account
                   code is E and the item record budget code is alpha (except Z), this TEX
                   code will be disregarded by the issue program.
%        NA        REDUCED PRICE ISSUE. At the option of the LRS CC/AO, items
                   with MIC 3, 4, or blank and ERRC XB3 or NF1 (with IEX E/6 or 3/K)
                   may be offered for sale at a reduced price (in lieu of transfer to disposal)
                   after 365 days in retention. ERRC XB3 or ERRC NF1 (with IEX E/6 or
                   3/K) items with MIC 1 or 2 assigned may be sold at a reduced price after
                   700 days in retention (i.e., 30 days before the full retention period is
                   met). Budget codes 1 and 9 are the only budget codes allowed. The
                   percentage discount (from 01 up to a maximum of 99 percent off) is also
                   a LRS CC/AO option. Only items on hand will be discounted and
                   backordering at a reduced price is not allowed. To ensure only items
                   approved by the LRS CC/AO are issued, the Funds Manager should
                   review the Base Supply Surveillance Report (D20), part 11, Reduced
                   Price Issues. Issue inputs not meeting the above conditions will produce
                   a non-cumulative 001 reject. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
                   corrective action.
@        NA        PRINT OUTPUT DOCUMENT ON INPUT FUNCTION. May be used
                   on UND A or B ISU inputs to bypass assignment of TEX code 4 when
                   original input resulted in a 295 reject. When TRIC is MSI, this code is
                   authorized for unserviceable MRSP and IRSP issues.
.        NA        Internally assigned by issue programs to allow issue of excess
(perio             expendable peacetime operating stock (POS) above the requisition
d)                 objective to satisfy initial WRM requirements. Unsatisfied quantities
                   will be backordered with TEX period (.). This TEX code is applicable
                   only to supportable WRM requirements, budget codes 1 and 9, ERRCD
                   XF and XB.
Notes:
1. TEX codes are not authorized and will be blanked by the ILS-S for part numbered item
requests (P in position 5 of the stock number).
a. If a reject is produced which requires reprocessing of the issue request with a TEX code,
use the part/reference number cross-reference to obtain the stock number.

 b. If an applicable stock number is found for the part-numbered item requested, reprocess
 the customer issue request using the stock number.
 2. Use of dual TEX codes will cause the output issue document (DD 1348-1A) to print at
 the input terminal.

Note: Enter the serial number as follows:
a. If the requested items are used on aircraft, enter the aircraft two position year and five-position
serial number/equipment identification (tail number) code. For other than aircraft requests enter
the last seven positions of the serial number.
b. If a serial number or tail number is not available, and the maintenance activity is supported by
IMDS CDB, enter the locally constructed four-digit IMDS CDB equipment identification code in
positions 70-73.
c. If the locally constructed four-digit IMDS CDB equipment identification code is used in
positions 70-73, and the year of manufacture is not known, positions 67-69 may be non-significant
numeric characters in this field.
d. If the maintenance activity is not supported by IMDS CDB, and no serial number or tail number
exists, use non-significant numeric characters in this field.
e. If the requested items are for communications-electronics (CE) activities supported by IMDS
CDB and a serial number exists, enter zeros in positions 67-68 (instead of the equipment serial
number) and the locally constructed five-digit IMDS CDB equipment identification in positions 69-
73.
f. If the requested items are SPRAM (activity code D with a blank mark-for), the ILS-S
automatically assigns the major command code, SRD of ZZZ, and work unit code ZZ. See Para
5.2.22.2 for additional information about SPRAM item issues.


    5.2.13. ILS-S Edit Of Customer Issue Requests.
        5.2.13.1. Purpose. To explain internal ILS-S processing of the different types of
        customer issue requests.
        5.2.13.2. General Updates. Recurring customer issue requests are designed to update
        ILS-S demand data. Additionally, the ILS-S updates applicable item and detail record
        balances as appropriate upon issue of stock. If required, the ILS-S creates substitute
        detail records for equipment item issues. Any time activity code E, J, M, P, R, S, U, W,
        or X customer issue requests are killed, the ILS-S provides an I023 MGT notice. See
        AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
        5.2.13.3. ILS-S Edits. All customer issue (ISU) input transactions are edited by the ILS-
        S with the exceptions listed below. Any error in the issue transaction input that cannot be
        corrected by the ILS-S will be rejected (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7). Line 1 of the
        reject output document will be identical to line 1 of the input image with the following
        exceptions:
            5.2.13.3.1. Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC). If the MMAC is
            blank on the input issue transaction, the ILS-S will assign the MMAC loaded on the
            item record.
            5.2.13.3.2. Urgency Justification Code (UJC). If the input UJC is AR or BR, the
            ILS-S will automatically assign the AWP delivery destination from the organization
            (518) record, regardless of the input entry. If the delivery destination is blank and the
            input UJC is not AR or BR, the delivery destination from the organization (518)
372                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      record is assigned on the issue output document or due-out detail (backorder) record.
      If the input issue transaction contains a blank UJC, the ILS-S assigns UJC CZ. See
      Para 5.2.9 for more information.
      5.2.13.3.3. Customer Issue Request Priorities. Customer issue request processing by
      LRS/Materiel Management Activities depends a great deal upon the priority of the
      request. Priority handling requirements may be locally established at the option of
      the commander of the delivery function. However, priority handling is not required
      unless needed to meet maximum delivery times. Customer Service or other
      applicable LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel involved with receiving
      customer issue requests may question requested delivery priorities which appear to
      contain an inflated UJC/UND. Note: While priority challenges may reduce the
      number of violations that can occur in the Air Force ILS-S and reduce total costs, the
      customer bears ultimate authority and responsibility for the UJC/UND used on
      requests.
      5.2.13.3.4. Fill or Kill Customer Issue Requests. Many priority customer issue
      requests are processed in the ILS-S as “Fill or Kill” when the input TEX code is
      blank. If the following conditions are met, the ILS-S automatically processes the
      customer issue request as fill or kill (TEX 4):
         5.2.13.3.4.1. Customer issue requests with urgency of need designator (UND) A.
         5.2.13.3.4.2. Customer issue requests with urgency justification code (UJC) BR,
         BO, or BQ.
         5.2.13.3.4.3. Customer issue requests with UND C for items containing NPPC 2
         or 5. Note: When an input issue request is killed, take action as outlined AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
      5.2.13.3.5. AWP Customer Issue Requests. If the customer issue request is to satisfy
      AWP requirements, the ILS-S performs the following edits on the input ISU
      transaction: the UJC in positions 65-66 must equal AR or BR, and positions 67-80
      must contain the end-item document number in the mark-for field. See Para 5.2.12
      for the correct mark-for usage. Additionally, positions 94-95 must contain the end-
      item system designator (TEX code not equal to E or Y), and positions 118-120 must
      contain the end-item standard reporting designator (SRD). Note: If the ILS-S
      cannot locate the end-item document number or system designator, the input is
      rejected. Establish a memo (TEX 7) backorder (due-out) for the repair cycle
      (ERRCD XD(*)/XF(*)) AWP end-item when maintenance elects to order bits and
      pieces (instead of the end-item) for repair. For this low priority-type requirement,
      assign urgency justification code (UJC) CZ. Processing in this manner provides
      visibility through ILS-S DIFM and AWP reports, while excluding the requirement
      from priority management. If the issue transaction contains TEX E, normal issue
      (ISU) transaction formats cannot be used. Additionally, if the quantity requested is
      greater than one (1) for the end-item document number identified in positions 67-80,
      or multiple DIFM details exist, the ILS-S will process the input issue (ISU)
      transaction as fill or kill. Note:       Customer backorders (due-out) cannot be
      established against multiple DIFM detail quantities due to automated AWP status
      update techniques.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 373


        5.2.13.3.6. Equipment Item Customer Issue Requests. The following action is taken
        by the ILS-S for customer issue requests for equipment items:
           5.2.13.3.6.1. Authority for issue flag. If the customer request is for non-
           accountable equipment (activity code is P), enter the appropriate authority for
           issue flag in position 115 of the input issue (ISU) transaction (Para 5.2.6). Note:
           No ILS-S edits are performed for requested equipment items containing ERRCD
           NF1.
           5.2.13.3.6.2. Interchangeable equipment issues for equipment management code
           (EMC) 1 items. If the input authority for issue flag is Z, and requested assets are
           not available, the ILS-S will attempt to issue interchangeable assets if the
           interchangeable asset(s) contains equipment management code (EMC) 1.
           Otherwise, the ILS-S will “kill” the request and produce an I023 (other asset)
           MGT notice. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and
           processing instructions.
           5.2.13.3.6.3. Equipment items containing NPPC 9. If the requested equipment
           item contains NPPC 9 (unacceptable for Air Force use), the ILS-S will change the
           input TEX code to 4 (fill or kill) and continue processing unless TEX code 6 is
           used.
           5.2.13.3.6.4. Equipment part numbered items. If position 8 of the equipment
           issue request contains a P (part number), the ILS-S will attempt to convert the part
           number to a stock number. If the part number cannot be converted, an I007 MGT
           notice (Part Number Request Requires External Review) will be produced. See
           AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and processing instructions.
        5.2.13.3.7. Other than Requested NSN. If other than the requested item was issued
        (for example, master, interchangeable, or substitute with a different unit of issue), the
        stock number on the output will be different from the stock number on the input.
        5.2.13.3.8. TCTO (K) Stock Numbers. If the requested stock number contains a K in
        position 5, the ILS-S automatically assigns demand code I. See Para 5.2.10 for more
        information about demand code usage.
        5.2.13.3.9. Force Activity Designator (FAD). If the issue request input transaction
        FAD is blank, the ILS-S assigns the FAD from the organization (518) record.
        5.2.13.3.10. Off-Base Organizations. If the issue request is received from an off-
        base organization, the ILS-S computes and assigns the delivery priority to the output
        issue document.
        5.2.13.3.11. Issue Exception (IEX) Code. If the requested item contains IEX E or K,
        the serviceable balance must be zero or the issue transaction (ISU) input will reject.
        If the IEX E or K item request is done using degraded operations procedures (TEX 6),
        or the organization is off-base, the serviceable balance edit does not apply.
        5.2.13.3.12. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code T. If the input issue transaction
        contains TEX T, the ILS-S assigns requisition advice code 2B. See Para 5.2.11 for
        more information.
374                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.13.3.13. Budget Code. The ILS-S applies the budget code from the requested
      item record.
      5.2.13.3.14. Controlled Item Code (CIC). The ILS-S applies the controlled item
      code from the requested item record.
      5.2.13.3.15. Other Customer Issue Request Edits. Under various conditions,
      customer issue requests are edited for quantity and/or unit cost conditions as follows:
         5.2.13.3.15.1. High cost. If the unit cost multiplied by the issue input transaction
         quantity exceeds ten positions, a 299 Reject will be produced. See AFH 23-123,
         Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
         5.2.13.3.15.2. Multiple DIFM flag. The item record must contain a multiple
         DIFM flag if the customer issue request is for a repair cycle item (ERRCD
         XF(*)/XD(*)), and the input quantity is greater than one. Otherwise, the quantity
         will be changed to one and an I001 MGT notice (Quantity Changed to One; No
         Multiple DIFM Flag Loaded for Non-Degraded Operations) will be produced.
         See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and processing
         instructions.
         5.2.13.3.15.3. Type account code (TAC) B. If the requested item record has type
         account code B (supplies), the activity code on the issue input transaction must
         equal B, C,D, J, M, P, R, S, U, W, or X.
         5.2.13.3.15.4. Type account code (TAC) E. If the requested item record has type
         account code E (equipment), the issue input transaction activity code must equal
         C, E, R, or P.
         5.2.13.3.15.5. Project codes 175 and Y31. If requested assets are available, the
         ILS-S issues the requested stock number unless TEX 8, H, X, or Z is used with
         project code 175 or Y31. If any one of these conditions exists, the ILS-S
         establishes a customer backorder (due-out) regardless of the on-hand balance.
      5.2.13.3.16. Issue of Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) Items. If the
      customer requirement cannot be satisfied from the requested stock number, the ILS-S
      checks for an Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) number or relationship
      code located on the requested stock number item record. The ILS-S will issue the
      requested item only when the item relationship code is other than Master (M),
      Interchangeable (I), or Substitute (S). Note:           The ILS-S will not issue
      interchangeable items across requested items containing different system designators.
         5.2.13.3.16.1. Substitute item issues. If the item relationship code is S
         (substitute), the ILS-S issues the substitute item only if the requested quantity and
         the unit of issue can be converted, and the item is not in the D097 X file. If the
         requested item is a substitute, and other master or interchangeable assets are
         available, the ILS-S kills the unsatisfied quantity and provides an I023
         management notice (Other Asset Data). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
         more information and processing instructions.
         5.2.13.3.16.2. Master/interchangeable item issues. If the item relationship code is
         M (master) or I (interchangeable), the ILS-S checks all other items in the group
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  375


           containing relationship code M or I and issues available assets. Note:
           Relationship code M and I assets frozen for inventory are bypassed. If the
           relationship code M and I asset contains a subgroup code (ISG order code) equal
           to or greater than the subgroup code of the requested stock number, the asset will
           be issued. If relationship code M and I assets are not available for issue, the
           requested stock number will be killed or backordered depending upon the input
           TEX code. Example: Requested item is in subgroup AA(*), requirement can be
           satisfied from subgroup AB(*), but requirements for items in subgroup AB(*)
           cannot be satisfied from items in subgroup AA(*).
           5.2.13.3.16.3. Interchangeable items frozen for inventory. If requested assets are
           available, but frozen for inventory, the ILS-S rejects the input. Additionally, if
           the requested item is not available, and M or I related assets are available but
           frozen for inventory, the ILS-S automatically kills the request and provides an
           I023 MGT notice.
           5.2.13.3.16.4. Unequal units of issue. If the requested items are not repair cycle
           (ERRCD XF(*)/XD(*)), WRM, MSK, MRSP, or supply point assets, and the
           request cannot be satisfied from M or I related assets, the ILS-S will continue to
           search the group for substitutes (S) with a convertible unit of issue and process the
           issue request as follows:
               5.2.13.3.16.4.1. If substitute assets are available, the ILS-S issues the assets if
               the requested quantity and the units of issue can be automatically converted.
               5.2.13.3.16.4.2. If the units of issue cannot be automatically converted, the
               ILS-S continues to search the group for other related assets.
               5.2.13.3.16.4.3. If other related assets are available, or a substitute asset with
               a convertible unit of issue is located, the ILS-S kills the unsatisfied quantity
               and provides an I023 MGT notice.
        5.2.13.3.17. Unfilled Customer Issue Requests. If the total quantity requested cannot
        be satisfied (filled), the ILS-S backorders or kills the remaining quantity according to
        the input TEX code, NPPC, and priority of the request as follows:
           5.2.13.3.17.1. If the input issue request contains TEX 7, G, or M, the ILS-S
           backorders the unsatisfied quantity. See Para 5.2.11 for more information and
           processing instructions.
           5.2.13.3.17.2. If the requested item contains NPPC 4 or 9, the ILS-S bypasses the
           item record unless the input supply condition code is D or J. The ILS-S kills the
           unsatisfied quantity and provides an I023 MGT notice. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
           Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and processing instructions.
           5.2.13.3.17.3. Degraded Operations Processing of Customer Issue Requests. If
           the customer request is done using degraded operations procedures, the ILS-S
           issues from the requested stock number only. If the requested stock number is
           frozen, or if insufficient assets are available on the item record, the ILS-S
           produces a 469 or 290 Reject respectively. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
           more information.
 376                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


     5.2.14. Issue Exception (IEX) Code.
        5.2.14.1. Purpose. To explain the one-position alpha/numeric IEX code assigned to ILS-
        S item records. Issue exception codes identify unique issue conditions and/or processing
        instructions for items. The IEX code is loaded to item records by input of a Stock
        Control Data (FCD) load, change, and delete transaction. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B,
        Stockage Procedures for more information concerning FCD transactions. Additionally,
        standard IEX codes that apply to every item, or a group of items, may be assigned
        through the use of exception phrase records. Exception phrase records are updated by an
        Exception Phrase Record (FXR) input transaction. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8
        for more information.
        5.2.14.2. Issue Exception Code (IEX) Assignment Rules.
           5.2.14.2.1. Major commands/bases may assign IEX codes to identify dual issue
           conditions such as items required for time change requirements. Note: Dual codes
           will not be assigned for IEX 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, B, E, F, L, N, or O type conditions.
           5.2.14.2.2. IEX codes are used by ILS-S programs for a variety of management
           decisions. If a conflict exists on assignment of two or more IEX codes, local
           management determines the appropriate IEX code to assign.
           5.2.14.2.3. IEX codes P-Z are assigned by MAJCOMs.
        5.2.14.3. Exception Notice Code (ENC) Logic. Each IEX code assigned to items in the
        ILS-S requires a corresponding Exception Notice Code (ENC). The ENC determines
        whether related issue transactions process or reject. The ENC is located on the exception
        phrase record (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8).

Notes:
1. IEX 6 and E are for Individual Equipment Items.
2. See Ch 10 for proper assignment of these codes.
a. If the LRS CC/AO directs, change the ENC to P for IEX 9 items.
b. If the ENC is changed to P for IEX 9 items, establish local procedures IAW AFMAN
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  379


23-122, Ch 5 to ensure the DD 1348-1A output issue document contains the required
certificate.
3. IEX D is assigned by Stock Control personnel to improve support for customer
requirements. IEX D prevents automatic backorder of items which cannot be requisitioned
online. An example of when IEX D may be used is when the item is assigned a requisition
exception (REX) code 4 (do not requisition), REX 5 (requires additional information from
the customer prior to requisitioning), or when the item has a NPPC 2, 3, 5, or 9 and a
replacement stock number is available. See Para. 5.2.47. for more information concerning
REX codes. Processing instructions for each item assigned IEX D should be readily
available if rejects occur. This will ensure processing actions are not unnecessarily
delayed. Additionally, processing actions may be entered in the item record nomenclature
field. However, when the nomenclature field is used for processing instructions, the
instructions must be complete and understandable. The intent of using this method is to
provide enough information on reject notices so processing of the customer request is not
delayed. Standard phrases such as: ORDER NHA, USE 1560001234567BF, or ORDER
REPAIR KIT should be used instead of local abbreviations. Caution: Do not use the
nomenclature field when processing instructions require extensive explanation, multiple
stock numbers, or information which exceeds the available positions of the nomenclature.
In these cases, use either the exception control card (ECC) image for the REX assigned (if
applicable) or an ECC for the IEX D. The objective is to make it easier to satisfy customer
demands without unnecessary delay. Any method that satisfies this objective is allowed if
locally documented in either a supplement or local operating instruction.
4. IEX G is assigned for Civil Engineering request.
5. The following information applies:
a. If the major command desires, maintain ECC images for IEX P through Z.
b. If local management desires, maintain ECC images for IEX 1 through 9 and A through
O. Normally, ECC images are not maintained for these IEX codes.
6. Assign IEX H to QEC kits and afterburners.
7. Assign IEX 7 to all hazardous material/waste item records. IEX 7 will not be used in
place of IEX 9.
8. Assign IEX 9 to items containing ODCs as determined by the HAZMART/BES. For
these types of items, all customer issue requests must be accompanied by an approved Air
Force waiver.
9. IEX B is not required for serialized small arms which have serialized report code (SRC)
A assigned or COMSEC items which have SRC of C assigned. COMSEC items with
MMAC codes CA, CK, CL, CO, CR, and CY must have SRC C loaded on the item record.
SRCs are normally loaded automatically through Stock Number User Directory (SNUD)
(BME) change transactions received from the Cataloging and Standardization Center
(CASC).

   5.2.16. Document Flow and Processing Procedures for DD 1348-1A, Output Issue
   (ISU/MSI/DOR) Document.
       5.2.16.1. Purpose. To explain the output issue (ISU/MSI/DOR) document (DD 1348-
       1A) flow and processing procedures.
       5.2.16.2. Most retail materiel management activities use Asset Tracking System’s to
       create the DD 1348-1A output documents. The output issue documents are used to
       initiate and track the physical movement of customer-requested materiel. Some
       locations, however, continue to use DD 1348-1A issue documents output by the ILS-S.
       Regardless of the output issue document source, the document flows through the materiel
       picking and delivery processes as illustrated in Figure 5.2
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                385

   5.2.17. ILS-S Management Notice Output Formats And Distribution Instructions.
      5.2.17.1. Purpose. To provide the output format and distribution instructions of
      management notices concerning the processing of customer issue requests. Note: If
      during issue request processing an error is detected, an I117 MGT notice (Unable to
      Continue Other Asset Notice) will be produced on the input device. The error condition
      will output a 799 REJ notice (DML Error) on the RPS/main site console for corrective
      action. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
      5.2.17.2. Management Notice Document Formats. The printed output document will
      appear in the same format as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. Additionally,
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 outlines the formats and processing instructions of the
      output management notices discussed herein. Generally, line 1 of the management notice
      output document resulting from successful processing of an issue (ISU/MSI) transaction
      will contain the input image. Lines 2, 3, 4, and 5 may contain an I004, I005, I106, and/or
      I023 MGT notice, or any combination thereof. The last line of the management notice
      output document contains accumulated totals as described below. The number of lines
      between the fifth and last line of the management notice output document varies,
      depending on the number of ILS-S item and detail records with available assets on-hand
      in the requested ISG.
      5.2.17.3. Management Notice Output Format.

        notices may appear on the same DD 1348-1A, local management will determine
        distribution. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning
        the following management notices. Note: One copy of all output management notices
        indicating a bench stock item will be provided to Bench Stock Support.
           5.2.17.4.1. I004 MGT Notice I004 (ISU Kill DUO). Destroy the I004 MGT notice
           when this notice is received indicating the total requested quantity was issued to the
           customer.
           5.2.17.4.2. I004 MGT Notice. If the killed issue request is subsequently cancelled by
           the customer, send the I004 MGT Notice (at the option of MAJCOM) to the
           requesting organization or activity, with the name of the individual authorizing the
           cancellation in Block D.
           5.2.17.4.3. I023 MGT Notice. If the issue request is killed, and other assets are
           available, an I023 MGT notice is produced. If suitable assets are available, issue the
           assets using the originally requested document number. Distribute the I023 MGT
           notice when the requested quantity was killed as follows:
               5.2.17.4.3.1. Available Assets. Verify UND A or B issue requests with the
               customer when suitable assets are available. If available suitable assets are
               subsequently issued, destroy the I023 MGT notice when the request has been
               satisfied.
               5.2.17.4.3.2. Unavailable Assets. Verify UND A or B requests when suitable
               assets are not available. If backorder (due-out) is requested by the customer,
               reinput the issue request transaction with TEX M in position 51. After successful

            processing, and at the option of the MAJCOM, destroy all copies of the I023
            MGT notice or forward to the requesting organization (non-DIFM items). For
            DIFM items, send two copies of the I023 MGT notice to the requesting
            organization and 2 copies to the FSC.
  5.2.18. Customer Backorders.
     5.2.18.1. Firm/Memorandum (Memo) Customer Backorders. A customer backorder
     (due-out) is established in the ILS-S when requested materiel is not available to satisfy
     customer need. The ILS-S performs numerous edits on backorder requirements and
     determines whether or not the requirement will be requisitioned from the source of
     supply. When requisition transactions are created, firm customer backorders are
     established. When the ILS-S or management determines no requisitioning action should
     be taken, a memorandum (memo) customer backorder is created.
        5.2.18.1.1. Firm customer backorders. Under normal circumstances, when requested
        materiel is not available to satisfy customer need, firm customer backorders are
        created and requisitioning action taken. A firm customer backorder (due-out) denotes
        ILS-S requisitioning action to fill the requirement. In other words, a requisition
        transaction has been submitted to the source of supply to satisfy the customer request.
        There are circumstances when submitting a requisition to a source of supply is
        inappropriate. In these cases, a memo customer backorder is created.
        5.2.18.1.2. Memorandum (memo) customer backorders.               A memo customer
        backorder (due-out) indicates requisitioning action to fill the customer requirement
        has not been taken. Examples of when the ILS-S automatically creates memo
        backorders (due-outs) include customer funds expired, Supply Point and WRM kit
        replenishments, and when requested items contain some sort of restriction and contain
        a requisition exception (REX) code. Additionally, memo customer backorders can be
        created manually using a transaction exception (TEX) code on the customer issue
        request. Refer to Para 5.2.11 for an explanation of TEX codes used on customer
        issue requests.
     5.2.18.2. ILS-S Backorder Edits. The ILS-S performs a funds availability edit against
     the requesting organization’s project funds management record (PFMR) when a
     backorder is to be established with obligated customer funds. Organizational funds are
     obligated to fund ILS-S backorders if the requested items are contained in the Material
     Support Division (MSD), or General Support Division (GSD) of the Air Force Supply
     Management Activity Group (SMAG). Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial
     Management for ILS-S due-out detail record obligation procedures. Note:          Fund
     availability edits are not performed in some circumstances. See Para 5.2.11 for more
     details.
     5.2.18.3. Backorder (Due-Out) Cause Code Assignment. The ILS-S assigns backorder
     (due-out) cause codes to each customer backorder to assist management with decisions
     associated with retail stockage policy. The cause code provides valuable information to
     target improved management practices when necessary. Assignment of backorder (due-
     out) cause codes are based upon whether the items are stocked (demand-based stock
     level) or non-stocked items. Refer to Para 5.2.20 for detailed explanations of stocked
390                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      and non-stocked backorder cause codes. See Ch 2 for an explanation of demand-based
      stock level computations.
      5.2.18.4. Mission Capable (MICAP) Backorders. Mission Capable (MICAP) customer
      backorders are the highest form of expedite backorder established in the ILS-S. MICAP
      customer backorders are established when the lack of requested item(s) negatively
      impacts the mission of the organization, unit, or wing. Therefore, MICAP backorders
      require special processes to ensure customer backorders are afforded the highest level of
      visibility and management attention. MICAP conditions require intense scrutiny and
      verification to ensure item shortages are satisfied locally by all means possible prior to
      backorder establishment. See Para 5.2.9 for more information concerning MICAP
      backorders.
  5.2.19. ILS-S Memorandum (MEMO) Backorder Logic.
      5.2.19.1. Purpose. Describe conditions when memorandum (memo) backorders are
      created in the ILS-S.
      5.2.19.2. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code. When the TEX code on the customer
      issue request equals 1, 7, 8, 9, G, H, P, or Y, a memo backorder (due-out) is established.
      See Para 5.2.11 for more information.
      5.2.19.3. Supply Point and Mission Support Kit (MSK) Items. For all Supply Point and
      MSK detail record replenishments, a memo backorder is created.
      5.2.19.4. Requisition Exception (REX) Code Usage. When a REX code is assigned to
      the item record, a memo backorder is established. This will cause the ILS-S to create a
      350 MGT notice (Requisition Suppressed by REX/NPPC/Bud CD/ERRCD/QUP or
      Local U/I). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and processing
      instructions concerning 350 MGT notices. See Para 5.2.47 for more information
      concerning REX code usage.
      5.2.19.5. Insufficient Funds. When funds are not available in the stock fund to support
      requisitioning action, a memo backorder is created and a funds requirement (FRC) image
      is created for external action. See Para 5.2.53 for more information.
      5.2.19.6. Budget Code 9 Equipment Items. For all customer backorder requirements for
      equipment items containing budget code 9 and ERRCD NF(*) or ND(*), a memo
      backorder is created.
  5.2.20. Backorder (Due-Out) Cause Code.
      5.2.20.1. Purpose. To explain the assignment and use of the backorder (due-out) cause
      codes in the ILS-S.
      5.2.20.2. Definition of Backorder (Due-Out) Cause Codes. Backorder (due-out) cause
      codes identify the stock position in the ILS-S at the time a customer backorder is
      established. The due-out cause code is also used to isolate causes for backorders, and
      what action(s) is needed to prevent recurrence of the problem. For MICAP customer
      backorders, the due-out cause code is entered in position 26 of the MICAP report (B9M)
      transaction.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 391


      5.2.20.3. Base Stock Levels Defined. Items are generally classified as stocked and non-
      stocked. Stocked items are normally assigned demand-based stock levels that contain
      either full, or less than full base stock on hand. The ILS-S makes this determination by
      comparing the serviceable property on hand to the demand-based stock level quantity. If
      the quantity on hand is less than the demand-based stock level quantity, the item is
      considered to be at less than full base stock.
         5.2.20.3.1. Stocked Item - Full Base Stock. Stocked items with full base stock are
         defined as total stock on hand (serviceable + unserviceable - reparable) equal to or
         greater than the total stock authorized. Note: For non-recoverable items, full base
         stock is defined as assets in stock (on-hand) equal to or greater than the safety level
         quantity, plus the WRM on-hand quantity.
         5.2.20.3.2. Stocked Item - Less than Full Base Stock. Stocked item backorder cause
         codes are assigned due to insufficient assets available to support a demand-based
         stock level. Stocked items with less than full base stock are defined as total stock on-
         hand (serviceable + unserviceable) less than total stock authorized. Note: For non-
         recoverable items, less than full base stock equals the total stock on hand, minus
         quantity committed to WRM, is less than the safety level quantity.
      5.2.20.4. Non-stocked Item Backorder Cause Codes. Non-stocked item backorder cause
      codes are assigned due to insufficient item demand history for computation of a demand-
      based stock level. Normally, non-stocked item cause codes consist of three general
      groups of items including: items with no previous demand (first-time) or not enough
      demand history; items the ILS-S has decided not to stock; and items management has
      decided not to stock. See Table 5.24 for more information and explanation of each type
      of non-stocked item backorder cause code.

Table 5.24. Non-stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes.


 Cause Code         Explanation
 A                  No stock level established – First time recurring demand. No previous
                    demand or reparable generation before this request. This code is assigned to
                    change/transfer/or stop MICAP report (B9(*)) transactions by the ILS-S when
                    the type account code is E (equipment) or K (munitions).
 B                  No stock level established - Past recurring demand or reparable generation
                    experience but Air Force stockage policy precluded establishment of a
                    demand-based stock level.
 C                  Air Force stockage policy permits a demand-based stock level, but an external
                    decision by HQ AFMC has determined that stocking the item at the base
                    should be restricted. This Cause Code is also assigned when Air Force
                    stockage policy permits a demand-based stock level for the item, but only
                    non-recurring demands have occurred on the NSN.
 D                  Base decision not to stock the item. A demand-based stock level exists, but
                    the base has taken action not to stock the item such as assigning a maximum
                    level of zero.

Table 5.25. Stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes.

  Cause code       Explanation
  F                Full base stock - Depth of stock insufficient to meet MICAP/due-out
                   requirement.
  G                Full base stock - Quantity necessary for requirement is in AWP status.
                   The number of recoverable items in need of repair is equal to or greater
                   than the authorized stock level. Identifies repair part shortages. Assumes
                   if repair parts had been available, a serviceable asset would have been
                   available.
  H                Less than full base stock - Stock replenishment requisition exceeds
                   priority group UMMIPS standards. Focus attention on source of supply
                   processing of stock replenishment requisitions. Note: Will also be
                   assigned when a due-out has been manually linked to a stock
                   replenishment due-in.
  J                Less than full base stock - Stock replenishment requisition does not
                   exceed priority group UMMIPS standards. Additional follow-up or
                   upgrade action may be required. Note: Will also be assigned when a
                   due-out has been manually linked to a stock replenishment due-in.
  K                Less than full base stock - No stock replenishment due-in established.
                   Take action to determine the reason.
  R                Full base stock – Assets cannot be used to satisfy this requirement
                   because they are deployed, inaccessible (off-base supply point), or
                   unavailable.
  S                Less than full base stock. Stock replenishment requisition exceeds
                   UMMIPS time standards by priority group and AWP assets are on order
                   at time of MICAP.
  T                Less than full base stock. Stock replenishment requisition does not
                   exceed UMMIPS time standards by priority group and AWP assets are on
                   order at time of MICAP.
  X                Less than full base stock. No due-in established and AWP assets are on
                   hand at time of MICAP.

        5.2.22.2. Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) Item Issues.
           5.2.22.2.1. Purpose. To provide additional details about issues of Special Purpose
           Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) items.
           5.2.22.2.2. Special Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) Item
           Issues. Issues of SPRAM items are processed in the ILS-S using activity code D. This
           includes initial and increased authorizations and replacement requirements.
           Additionally, demand code I is used for new or increased requirements. Demand code
           R is used for replacement requirements.
                 5.2.22.2.2.1. SPRAM Issue Request Requirements. SPRAM assets, containing
                 ERRCD XD(*) and XF(*), are processed using issue (ISU) transactions. Urgency
                 justification codes AV, BV, or CV are used as appropriate.
                 5.2.22.2.2.2. TEX Codes. TEX codes 7, P, V, T, 2, K, and 6 are authorized for
                 use. The authorized quantity edits are bypassed. When the input contains TEX 2
                 or K, the ILS-S will allow excess assets to be issued to SPRAM detail records.
  5.2.23. Establish MICAP Backorders.
        5.2.23.1. High Priority Order Management. The ILS-S supports the near real-time
        management, sourcing, and monitoring of all MICAP orders. The ILS-S provides several
        “reports” to assist with the management of high priority orders. Users can search for and
        select the desired order and the system will display the order detail information (item
        record, due-out, due-in, events/bullets, etc.) for the order selected. Authorized users can
        also process selected transactions against the orders (including manually sourcing orders
        from other ILS-S accounts). More information on this feature can be found in Ch 10 of
        the ES-S User’s Manual.
        5.2.23.2. MICAP reporting system (D165B). Base MICAP report (B9M) transactions
        identify MICAP start, stop, and change incidents daily to the D165B system. The D165B
        system is located at Oklahoma Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC), and provides data to
        assist in the preparation of comprehensive statistical studies and analyses for
        congressional committees, DoD, Air Staff, and all levels of management. The D165B
        system provides all levels of management necessary data for timely and effective MICAP
        item management, and a method to identify and isolate causes for exception management.
        The MICAP reporting system identifies the most significant item(s) contributing to
        world-wide MICAP incidents, and provides the visibility required to restore aerospace
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                395


     vehicles or end-items of equipment to a state of operational readiness. The D165B
     system is a main source of data for ensuring all base MICAP requisitions and report
     transactions are valid.
     5.2.23.3. MICAP interrogation/error (B9(*)) transactions. The MICAP/AWP reporting
     system sends MICAP interrogation (B91/B92/B93) and error (B94) transactions to bases
     when additional information is required, mismatches occur, or errors are identified on
     base MICAP report (B9M) transactions. When possible, responses to MICAP
     interrogation/error transactions are produced automatically by the ILS-S. Otherwise, I-
     series management notices or reject notices are produced. See Para 5.2.33 for MICAP
     interrogation/error transaction receipt and reply procedures. See Para 5.2.34 for a list of
     MICAP error codes used on MICAP error (B94) transactions. To limit D165B
     interrogation and error transactions as much as possible, the ILS-S performs edits against
     established MICAP data. See Para 5.2.35 for more information. Note: AFMC SCM-R
     will reply to all D165B interrogations not automatically corrected by ILS-S and clear all
     rejects.
  5.2.24. MICAP Report (B9M) Transaction Format.
     5.2.24.1. Purpose. To explain the creation and processing procedures of the MICAP
     report (B9M) transaction. The B9M transaction is sent to the MICAP reporting system
     (D165B) on a daily basis to report base MICAP incidents.
     5.2.24.2. Manual MICAP Reporting. Manual reporting of MICAP start, stop, and
     change incidents must be accomplished when the ILS-S is inoperative for more than four
     days. Note: Manual reporting is not authorized under any other condition. Manual
     MICAP report (B9M) transactions will always contain cause code Y. Various MICAP
     report transaction codes, such as delete, hour, condition, etc., will be used to accurately
     record actions affecting MICAP conditions. These and other MICAP codes are listed in
     Para 5.2.30 See Table 5.29 for preparation instructions and format for MICAP report
     (B9M) transactions.
     5.2.24.3. Satellite MICAP Reporting. Satellite Supply accounts will input MICAP data
     at an appropriate input terminal function when available. Otherwise, MICAP data will be
     provided to the Mission Support section monitor at the host Supply account. If provided,
     the host account will input satellite MICAP data at an input terminal function or through
     the RPS.
     5.2.24.4. Cumulative Reject Processor (D818). The cumulative reject processor (D818)
     listing identifies all MICAP input (NOR) or output (B9M) transactions rejected by the
     ILS-S during the processing day. Note: All MICAP report (B9M) transaction rejects
     appear as NOR transaction rejects on the D818 listing. All rejects associated with
     MICAP report transactions must be corrected and processed in a timely manner by the
     Mission Support section.
     5.2.24.5. Output Destination. RPS/main system.
     5.2.24.6. Input. None.
     5.2.24.7. Output Format. See Table 5.29

   5.2.30. MICAP Interrogation/Error (B9(*)) Transaction Processing.
       5.2.30.1. Purpose. To explain processing procedures and transaction format for Base
       Interrogation/Error (B9*) transactions. The B9* interrogation/error transactions are
       produced by D165B MICAP reporting (D165B) system to indicate a mismatch of records
       has occurred or base MICAP reports contain error conditions. Processing B9*
       interrogation/error transactions in the ILS-S will produce MICAP reply (B9M)
       transactions.
       5.2.30.2. B91 Interrogation Transactions. B91 interrogation transactions are produced
       by D165B to indicate a base MICAP requisition is located in the stock control (D035A)
       system and no corresponding MICAP report record is on file.
          5.2.30.2.1. Valid Base MICAP Exists. When B91 interrogation transactions are
          received and a valid base MICAP exists, the ILS-S automatically generates duplicate
          MICAP report (B9M) transactions. Note: The ILS-S does not write transaction
          histories for B91 transactions.
          5.2.30.2.2. Valid Base MICAP Does Not Exist. When B91 interrogation transactions
          are received and a valid base MICAP does not exist, a 260 Reject will occur. See
          AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 260 rejects. The
          following responses are appropriate, depending on the situation:
              5.2.30.2.2.1. MICAP Submitted in Error. If a MICAP requisition was submitted
              in error, downgrade or cancel the MICAP requisition in the ILS-S.
              5.2.30.2.2.2. MICAP Condition Not Identified. If the requisition is on file in the
              ILS-S but not identified as MICAP, upgrade the requisition to MICAP reportable
              using an NOR input transaction - Format B. Use the requisition date from the
              B91 transaction document number as the action date in the NOR transaction
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 403


             input. See Para 5.2.75 for more information.
             5.2.30.2.2.3. MICAP Not Established - Rejected. If the MICAP condition was
             not established due to rejected transactions, reprocess the issue transaction with N
             in position 54 and TEX code 7 in position 51. This will create a memo backorder
             in the ILS-S. Next, process a special requisition transaction using the same
             requisition number indicated on the B91 interrogation in positions 30-43 and the
             customer due-out document number in positions 67-80. These actions will
             establish the MICAP condition in the ILS-S and create an associated MICAP
             report (B9M) transaction.         See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order and
             Requisitioning and Para 5.2.1 for more information concerning issue transaction
             format and processing procedures. See Para 5.2.54 for more information
             concerning special requisition transaction format and processing procedures.
             5.2.30.2.2.4. Termination/Transfer Greater Than 90 days. If research indicates
             the MICAP either terminated or transferred more than 90 days ago, process an
             NOR – Format A input transaction. See Para 5.2.75 for more information
             concerning format A NOR transaction processing. Upon processing, the ILS-S
             will produce a duplicate MICAP report B9M (stop) transaction for the D165B
             system.

   5.2.31. B93 Interrogation Transactions. B93 interrogation transactions are produced by
   D165B when a MICAP shipment has been confirmed as received, but no MICAP report
   (B9M) transaction for the termination has been received.
         5.2.31.1. Valid MICAP Exists. When B92 or B93 interrogations are processed and valid
         MICAP details are on file in the ILS-S, a MICAP status report (B9Z) transaction is
         automatically created with advice code G. The B9Z transaction is produced for the
         activity identified in positions 4-6 of the B92 or B93 interrogation transaction.
         5.2.31.2. Valid MICAP Does Not Exist. When B92 or B93 interrogations are processed
         and no valid MICAP details are on file, a 260 Reject is produced. If the MICAP
         terminated (stopped) over 90 days ago, prepare and process an NOR-Format A
         transaction as outlined in Para 5.2.75 Processing of the NOR format A transaction will
         produce a duplicate MICAP report (B9M) stop transaction for the D165B system.
         5.2.31.3. Purpose. To explain processing procedures and transaction format for the Base
         Interrogation (B93) transaction. The B93 transaction is produced by the MICAP
         reporting (D165B) system when a MICAP shipment has been confirmed as received, but
         no MICAP report (B9M) stop transaction has been received by the D165B system.
         Processing of the B93 transaction in the ILS-S will produce a MICAP status (B9Z) reply

   5.2.32. B94 Error Transactions. B94 error transactions are used to interrogate and correct
   invalid MICAP data and produce corrected MICAP report transactions. The error code
   (position 68) on each B94 error transaction identifies the error condition. See Para 5.2.34
   for a list and explanation of error codes. When invalid data cannot be corrected
   automatically by the ILS-S, a 288 reject will be produced and the invalid data will be
   identified on the reject. Correct the invalid data on the B94 error transaction and reprocess.
   See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 288 rejects.
         5.2.32.1. No Valid MICAP Exists. When B94 error transactions are processed, and
         MICAP details are not on file, an I124 MGT notice (MICAP Requisition - Error
         Exception Notice) is produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information
         and processing instructions concerning I124 MGT notices. Corrective action includes
         research and verification of the requisition number cited in positions 30-43. Additionally,
         if the advice code in position 70 equals L, verify the document number in positions 71-
         78. If either of the document numbers are in error, correct and reprocess the B94 error
         transaction. If the document numbers are correct, no further action is required.
         5.2.32.2. Manual Error Correction. When the ILS-S cannot automatically correct invalid
         data, Mission Support will receive an I123 MGT notice (No Error Detected - Research
         Req). If the error cannot be corrected by Mission Support personnel, the initiator of the
         reject must be contacted to determine the invalid condition. If the invalid conditions have
         been corrected, a MICAP report (B9M) transaction must be manually prepared and sent
         to the initiator. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
         5.2.32.3. Purpose. To explain processing procedures and transaction format for the
         MICAP Error (B94) transaction. The B94 transaction is produced by the MICAP
         reporting (D165B) system to identify errors on base MICAP report (B9M) transactions.

        Transaction error codes, identifying the reason for the error, are listed in Para 5.2.34 To
        assist in correcting errors, Para 5.2.35 lists ILS-S edits for each data field on the B94

   5.2.33. B9Z - MICAP Status Report Transaction. The B9Z transaction is output by the
   ILS-S to provide the MICAP reporting (D165B) system open MICAP incident status. The
   B9Z transaction is produced by the ILS-S in response to B92 or B93 interrogation
   transactions. Additionally, the B9Z transaction is generated when updated status is received
   for MICAP requisitions from non-AFMC sources of supply.

  5.2.36. Requisition Submission.
     5.2.36.1. Automated (Inline) Requisitioning Process. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
     Activity centrally manages asset requisitions (unless otherwise assigned, e.g., MICAPs,
     AWPs, local RIDs, etc.) from the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Air Force policy
     specifies all ILS-S output requisition (A0*) transactions will be produced in MILSTRIP
     or DLMS format. The ILS-S automatically produces requisition transactions when
     requirements are computed through stock replenishment or customer requests. Therefore,
     automated due-out requisitioning occurs when customers request items from the
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity that are not available from shelf stock. The ILS-S
     will normally establish a customer due-out detail; create a receipt due-in detail; and
     produce an output requisition (A0*) transaction for the source of supply. Automated
     stock replenishment requisitioning occurs when the ILS-S requirements computation
     program identifies on-hand stocks below the reorder point (ROP). AMC Forward Supply
     Location (FSL) will use automated requisition procedures for all stock replenishment
     requirements with the exception of built-up. Process lateral requisitions for built-up
     assemblies to the designated Primary Supply Point (PSP) using the fill or back-order
     advice code. Note: The requisition quantity is the difference between the requisitioning
     objective and available assets. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedures for
     more information concerning the requirements computation program, reorder point, and
     requisitioning quantity. See Para 5.2.37 for ILS-S requisition (A0*) transaction output
     format and processing instructions. The ILS-S creates a single requisition for each “firm”
     customer due-out (activity codes D, J, R, or X that require requisition action). For
     customer due-outs, the requisition quantity is equal to the due-out quantity, including
     multiple DIFM XD due-outs. Stock replenishment requisitions and Readiness Spares
     Package (RSP) replenishment requisitions for XD items are established with a quantity
     of one.
     5.2.36.2. ILS-S requisition data elements. All MILSTRIP and DLMS requisition
     transactions are designed to contain common data that may be shared by retail and
     wholesale supply systems. See Para 5.2.38 for detailed descriptions and usages of the
     source of supply; requisition date; document identifier code (DIC); routing identifier code
     (RIC); media and status (M&S) code; quantity unit pack (QUP); requisition document
     number; requisition demand code; supplementary address; requisition priority designator;
     required delivery date (RDD); project code; Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)/intra-Air Force
     project code; and requisition advice code.
412                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.36.3. Requisition quantity and cost edits. For most items, the ILS-S validates the
      requisition quantity and cost when requisitions are created. The ILS-S will not do a
      reasonable quantity check for supply items containing a blank budget code (investment
      items) or items that contain Budget Codes A-H, J-U, or W-X. See Para 5.2.39 for more
      information concerning requisition quantity and/or cost edits.
      5.2.36.4. Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority Standards (UMMIPS). Priority
      designators for customer due-out or stock replenishment requisitions relate to specific
      UMMIPS time standards that are used to ensure expedient processing by both retail and
      wholesale supply activities. UMMIPS standards track the amount of time required
      between all facets of the requisition pipeline. For example, requisitions are tracked from
      the time of submission, during wholesale system processing, and through subsequent
      shipment and receipt. Specific UMMIPS standards have been established for each
      requisition priority group within Required Delivery Date (RDD). Additionally, different
      standards have been established for both CONUS and OCONUS requisitions. See Para
      5.2.46 for more information concerning UMMIPS standards for ILS-S requisitions.
      5.2.36.5. Requisition restrictions. Under certain conditions, the ILS-S will not produce
      requisitions when required. Item and funds-specific requisition restrictions may be
      implemented to allow for strict management of the General Support Division (GSD)
      stock fund. Primarily, item and fund restrictions delay or cancel requisitions prior to the
      output of a requisition transaction. In some cases, GSD funding limitations will cause the
      ILS-S to create a Funds Requirement (FRC) output image instead of a requisition. FRC
      output images are used to hold the requirement (requisition) in a delayed status until
      funding confirmation is received from the LRS/AFMC SCM-R or the requirement no
      longer exists.
         5.2.36.5.1. Item-specific requisition restrictions. Some requisition restrictions are
         based on the type of item or specific item coding. Item-specific requisition
         restrictions include: requisition exception coding; shelf life coding; and certain
         stockage priority code (SPC) assignments. The following paragraphs discuss the
         different types of item-specific requisition restrictions available in the ILS-S.
             5.2.36.5.1.1. Requisition exception (REX) codes. REX codes are used to restrict
             requisitions for specific items that are requisitioned using special procedures;
             when additional information is required; or for items that are never requisitioned
             in the ILS-S. See Para 5.2.47 for a complete list of REX codes and processing
             instructions for each.
             5.2.36.5.1.2. Shelf life codes. Shelf life codes are established in the ILS-S to
             identify the number of months new items may remain unused in storage before
             they must be reconditioned or condemned. The ILS-S assigns and uses shelf life
             codes to figure how many items to requisition automatically to replenish stock.
             To determine the number, the ILS-S divides the number of shelf life days by two
             (2), and then multiplies the resulting number by the daily demand rate (DDR).
             Note: The shelf life code does not identify the shelf life remaining on any
             particular unit(s) of on-hand stock. See Ch 2 for more information about ILS-S
             requisition restrictions based upon shelf life coding.
             5.2.36.5.1.3. Stockage Priority Code (SPC). The SPC is assigned by the ILS-S to
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 413


           expendable (ERRCD XB3) items. Stockage priority codes are one of the factors
           used to determine the number of demands an item experiences in a year. Once
           determined, a corresponding demand-based stock level can be established. In
           some cases, SPC assignment may restrict automatic stock replenishment
           requisitioning. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure for more
           information on SPC use and assignment.
        5.2.36.5.2. Funds-Specific Requisition Restrictions. The ILS-S will not produce
        automatic requisitions when selected funds-specific requisition restrictions are
        applied on the MACR. There are generally three methods to restrict automatic
        requisitions in the ILS-S. First, the Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR)
        may be coded to suppress requisitioning for categories of General Support Division
        (GSD) items. Second, a requisition suppression flag may be assigned to restrict
        requisitioning. Finally, funding restrictions may be applied in the ILS-S based upon
        source of supply and requisition dollar values. The following paragraphs describe
        these different types of funds-specific requisition restrictions.
           5.2.36.5.2.1. MACR. The MACR is used to track expenses (obligations/gross
           sales/credit returns) within the GSD stock fund. The GSD MACR is also used by
           management to suppress requisitions in the ILS-S. The fund’s manager
           establishes a MACR for all budget code 9 and Z items within each retail Materiel
           Management Activity. The MACR includes the number of obligations authorized
           and placed. Therefore, the MACR allows management of inventories within the
           GSD stock fund by controlling spending. See Ch 5 for an explanation of how the
           obligation and commitments fields of the MACR are updated. Note:               If
           requisitions should be restricted for stock replenishment or customer
           requirements, the Financial Working Group (FWG) will be briefed to the extent
           and time period of the restriction. This information will be used to inform base
           organizations that customer requests may not be filled.             For example,
           organizations will be informed that requisitioning of items for customer due-outs
           may be delayed until MACR restrictions are lifted. Explanation of MACR effects
           on ILS-S requisitions is provided in Para 5.2.50
           5.2.36.5.2.2. Requisition suppression flag. Another funds-specific requisitioning
           restriction is the assignment of the requisition suppression flag. If the dollar value
           of ILS-S requisitions exceed the Total Obligations Authorized (TOA) dollar value
           on the GSD MACR, the ILS-S will output an A977 MGT notice and set the
           requisition suppression flag to “on” in the MACR. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for
           more details on exceeding MACR TOA dollar values. See Ch 5 for more
           information concerning the assignment of the requisition suppression flag.
           5.2.36.5.2.3. Other funds-specific requisition restrictions. Other funds-specific
           requisition restrictions are applied to ILS-S requisitions based upon routing
           identifier code (RIC), requisition value, and base location. See Ch 5 for detailed
           descriptions of other funds-specific requisition restrictions.
        5.2.36.5.3. Fund requirement (FRC) output image. The ILS-S will produce a FRC
        output image for management review if the requisition is suppressed by either MACR
        edits, requisition suppression flags, or other funds-specific types of restrictions. The
 414                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


           AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity maintains the FRC file. The FRC file consists
           of customer request and stock replenishment restricted requisition requirements that
           have been restricted. Note: Each FRC output image contains a Funds Requirement
           Indicator (FRI) that identifies the reason for requisition suppression. See Para 5.2.53
           for more information concerning ILS-S funds-specific requisition restrictions, fund
           requirement indicators, and the format and processing instructions for FRC file
           images.
        5.2.36.6. Memorandum Requisition Data To DLATS. DLATS maintains logistics
        pipeline information for all wholesale items in the Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting
        System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT). LMARS/CWT is populated with
        information from the MILSTRIP, MILSTRAP, and DLMS transactions that flow through
        DLATS. Off-line requisitions that initially bypass DLATS (for example, those directly
        input into wholesale systems when called in) will not generate MILSTRIP or DLMS
        transactions. In order to ensure these off-line requisitions are correctly recorded in
        LMARS/CWT, the ILS-S will generate and route Memorandum Requisition Data to
        DLATS (DIC CHA/CH1) to DLATS when a special requisition (SPR) transaction is
        processed to any RID beginning with F (i.e., F**) or DLJ and a document number is
        entered in positions 30-43 of the SPR input. CHA/CH1 transactions are used to begin a
        requisitioning event and are used to compute customer wait time in the LMARS. No
        images are produced for other sources of supply because they (DLA/GSA/etc.) already
        have a process to update LMARS.
   5.2.37. Requisition Output (A0*) Transaction.
        5.2.37.1. Purpose. The requisition output (A0*) transaction is used to notify sources of
        supply of base requisitioning action for customer (due-out) and stock replenishment (due-
        in) requirements.
        5.2.37.2. Output Destination. RPS/main system or satellite terminal.
        5.2.37.3. Input. None.
        5.2.37.4. Output Format. See Table 5.43 below. The type of requisition (A0*)
        transaction produced depends upon base location, and the type of item required.

Notes:
1. Document Number. The requisition document number (pos. 30-43) is segregated
as follows:
a. Service Code (Position 30). The service code for ILS-S requisition transactions is
“F.”
b. Requisitioner (Position 31-35). The requisitioner contains type account code
(TAC) “B” or “E” in position 31, and the last four positions of the base stock record
account number (SRAN) in positions 32-35.
c. Date (Position 36-39). The date will be the current Julian date.
d. Serial Number (Position 40-43). The serial number is assigned automatically
(inline) or manually (offline) as required. See Para 5.2.41. for an explanation and
the details of constructing requisition serial numbers.
2. Demand Code. This field must contain demand code N,O, P, or R.
3. Project Code.
a. If the requisition was the result of repair and return (RAR) input, positions 57-58
will be blank and position 59 will contain $.
b. If the input routing identifier code (RIC) was JBB, and the item record RIC is
unequal to JBB, the project code field will contain the item record RIC, and the due-
in detail RIC will reflect JBB.
c. If the base SRAN is 3101 and the requisition is for XD2 stock replenishment,
positions 57-59 will contain project code 188.
4. Required Delivery Date. This is a multi-purpose field. If the RDD is
incompatible with the standard delivery date (SDD), the RDD will take precedence.
5. Urgency Justification Code.
416                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


a. If the requisition is for a MICAP item, see Para 5.2.9.for required entries.
b. If the requisition is for DIFM only, this field will contain NAR.
c. If a lateral requisition is for a due-out, this field will contain the FAD and UJC
from the due-out detail.
d. If the requisitions are ISSL, MSSL, or NSSL, this field will contain X03.
e. If the requisition requires priority transportation, this field will contain 777.
6. The signal code for budget code Y support equipment items will be “D” or “M”.
7. The fund code for budget code Y support equipment items will be Blank.
8. Position 67, positions 73-80.
a. Part number requisitions (REX code not 9, W, and X) for items where the
nomenclature field contains the technical order number, the technical order number
will be in positions 67-80.
b. If the REX code is 9, W, or X, position 70 will contain a C, and positions 71-80
will contain the first 10 positions of the nomenclature field.
9. Positions 68-70. Blank these positions before you submit the requisition to the
source of supply.
a. If a quantity shown in positions 25-29 exceeds the reasonable quantity check, then
this field will contain the letters QTY.
b. If the extended cost is greater than $999.99 for equipment, this field will contain
three special characters ($$$).
10. Requisition Exception (REX) Code. This field will contain the REX from the
item record when applicable. Blank this field before submitting the requisition to the
source of supply. When this condition occurs, the DIC will always be A05/A0E.
Change the DIC (for example, A01/A0A, etc.) when applicable before submission.
11. Positions 70-80. If DLATS converts a part number requisition (A02/A0B) to a
stock number requisition (A01/A0A), DLATS will blank positions 70-80 before
passing the requisition to the source of supply.
12. Positions 73-80. Lateral requisitions will contain the requisitioner's routing
identifier code (RIC) in positions 73-75 and the item manager's (IM) routing
identifier code in positions 78-80. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for authorized
routing identifier codes.
13. Position 76. This data applies to “Buildup” type items. Normally, a local SEX
has been assigned to prevent automatic shipments for these items. Stock Control
personnel should contact maintenance to see if enough items are available to make
the shipment. When processing a lateral requisition for buildup items, enter the SEX
code from the item record in position 76 to prevent the ILS-S from producing a 289
REJ notice. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for more information and processing
instructions for the 289 Reject.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                417

          5.2.38.2.1. Source of Supply. Normally, sources of supply for retail materiel
          management activities are comprised of HQ AFMC, DLA, GSA, Local Procurement
          (LP), Local Manufacture (LM), and other base (Lateral) sources. The ILS-S converts
          the source of supply internally to a corresponding routing identifier code (RIC). Once
          translated and assigned internally, the RIC is displayed automatically on output
          requisition (A0*) transactions.
          5.2.38.2.2. Requisition Date. All ILS-S-generated and manually initiated requisitions
          must contain the current Julian date. Computer Operations section will normally
          change the ILS-S date when the beginning-of-day (BOD) input is processed. When
          AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity specifies a date change, the requisition
 418                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


          serial number is reset to 0001. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for the procedures
          used to change the ILS-S requisition date.
          5.2.38.2.3. Document Identifier Code (DIC). ILS-S requisition transactions may be
          assigned different DICs based upon the type of requirement and base location. Table
          5.45 explains assignment of DICs. For the format and processing instructions for
          output requisition (A0*) transactions, see Para 5.2.37

Table 5.45. Requisition Document Identifier Code (DIC) Assignment.

          5.2.38.2.4. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). The RIC identifies the source of supply
          responsible for support of retail materiel management requisitions. See the
          Requisition Routing Identifier Code Directory located in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2
          for a list of RICs and the corresponding source of Materiel Management Activity.
          5.2.38.2.5. Media and Status Code (M&S). The M&S code identifies the type and
          amount of status to be received by requisitioning activities. Every ILS-S requisition
          must have a valid M&S code assigned. The M&S code for requisitions is determined
          by the requisition priority. Media and status code “S” is assigned to priority 01-08
          requisitions. Media and status code “K” is assigned to priority 09-15 requisitions.
          Note: MAJCOMS may specify changes to M&S code assignments. The M&S code
          is loaded on the ILS-S base constants record. For satellite activities, the M&S code is
          loaded on the satellite organization cost center record (OCCR). See DLM 4000.25-1-
          M for M&S codes used on ILS-S requisitions. See AFH Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more
          information on application of the M&S on the OCCR.
          5.2.38.2.6. Requisition Document Number. The requisition document number is
          used to identify individual customer (due-out) or stock replenishment requisitions.
          The requisition document number is 14 positions and constructed as follows:
             5.2.38.2.6.1. Service code. For Air Force ILS-S requisitions, the first position of
             the document number will always be “F”.
             5.2.38.2.6.2. Requisitioner identification. The second through sixth positions of
             the document number normally contain “B” (supplies) or “E” (equipment)
             followed by the last four positions of the Stock Record Account Number (SRAN)
             that identifies the base.
             5.2.38.2.6.3. Julian date. The seventh through tenth positions contain the current
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                419


           four position Julian date.
           5.2.38.2.6.4. Serial number. Lastly, the eleventh through fourteenth positions
           contain the requisition serial number. Requisition serial number assignment is
           performed either internally (system) or manually (offline). Each day, requisition
           serial numbers 0001 through 9999 are available for use. Blocks of requisition
           serial numbers are used for specific purposes and conditions. See Para 5.2.41 for
           explanation and construction of requisition serial numbers in the ILS-S.
        5.2.38.2.7. Requisition Demand Code. The requisition demand code indicates the
        frequency (how often) and circumstances under which items are requisitioned. There
        are four demand codes assigned to requisitions produced by the ILS-S. Note: If not
        specified by the customer during issue requests, always default to a recurring-type
        demand code. This will ensure potentially valid customer history is recorded by the
        ILS-S. See Para 5.2.42 for more information concerning requisition demand code
        assignment.
        5.2.38.2.8. Supplementary Address.            The supplementary address provides
        supplemental requisition data to sources of supply receiving retail Materiel
        Management Activity requisitions. For example, HQ AFMC uses supplementary
        address data to estimate second destination transportation costs. The supplementary
        address is displayed differently based upon whether the requisition is for a customer
        (due-out) or stock replenishment requirement. For stock replenishment requisitions,
        the default supplementary address field contains the first six positions of the
        organization title from the Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR). For customer
        (due-out) requisitions, the default supplementary address field contains a constant
        “Y” in the first position, the urgency justification code (UJC) from the customer due-
        out detail in the next two positions, and the standard reporting designator (SRD) or de
        indicated on the customer issue request in the last three positions. For requisitions
        designated for customer (due-out) requirements, the supplementary address field of
        the corresponding (linked) ILS-S due-in detail will also contain these same data.
        Note: If the supplementary address field is overridden due to exception controls or
        management, the specified supplementary address override data will take precedence.
        5.2.38.2.9. Requisition Priority Designator. The ILS-S assigns a two-position
        requisition priority designator to output requisition (A0*) transactions. The priority
        designator assigned depends on whether the requisition supports customer (due-out)
        or stock replenishment requirements. See Para 5.2.43 for an overall discussion of the
        factors used to determine the correct requisition priority as discussed in the following
        paragraphs.
           5.2.38.2.9.1. Priority assignment for customer (due-out) requirements. The
           priority designator assigned to customer due-out requisitions depends upon a
           combination of the urgency of need designator (UND) and force activity
           designator (FAD). The UND is the first position of the urgency justification code
           (UJC). See Para 5.2.9 for more information concerning assignment of the UJC.
           The FAD is taken from the customer issue request (if specified), or the OCCR
           contained in the ILS-S. See Para 5.2.43 for more information on how the
           requisition priority is assigned to requisitions associated with customer (due-out)
420                                                   AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         requirements. See AFH 23-123, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning
         storage of the FAD on the OCCR in the ILS-S.
         5.2.38.2.9.2. Priority assignment for stock replenishment requisitions. Stock
         replenishment requisitions are assigned priorities 11 through 15 based upon the
         FAD loaded for each base at each retail Materiel Management Activity. If a stock
         replenishment requisition is produced, the systems assigns a “1” in the first
         position of the requisition priority designator, and the retail Materiel Management
         Activity (organizational) FAD in the second position. For example, if the FAD
         equals “2,” the priority designator assigned to stock replenishment requisitions
         will be “12.” See Para 5.2.43 for more information and specific priority
         assignments for the different types of stock replenishment requisitions. See AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for more information on FAD assignment in the ILS-S.
      5.2.38.2.10. Required Delivery Date (RDD). The RDD serves several purposes.
      First, it specifies the actual need date for the materiel when this date is incompatible
      with the standard delivery date (SDD) assigned for each priority group. In this
      situation, the RDD replaces the SDD on the requisition to expedite transportation
      movement.         Additionally, the RDD identifies Mission Capable (MICAP)
      requirements; requisitions submitted after the effective date of a mass cancellation
      action; and requisitions (other than MICAP) which require priority transportation.
      Required delivery date (RDD) codes 999 or N** identify MICAP requisitions. See
      Para 5.2.44 for more information concerning the assignment of required delivery
      dates to requisitions.
      5.2.38.2.11. Project Code. The project code identifies requisitions that require
      special processing. The project code is also used for accumulating intra-service
      performance and cost data related to exercises, maneuvers, and other distinct
      programs, projects, and operations. Project codes are assigned by individual Service,
      and DLA for DoD projects. Additional guidance and a list of project codes
      authorized for Air Force projects are provided in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
         5.2.38.2.11.1. Effect of project codes on base requisitions. Project codes, other
         than Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
         project codes, do not provide or imply any priority or precedence for requisition
         processing. Therefore, other types of project codes never alter or override the
         normal priority designators assigned to base requisitions. ILS-S requisition (A0*)
         transactions that contain project codes will be processed through the LRS,
         Materiel Management Activity or Transportation Activity channels according to
         the priority designator as prescribed in Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue
         Priority Standard (UMMIPS) directives.
      5.2.38.2.12. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)/Intra-Air Force Project Code Policy. The Air
      Force has authorized the use of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and Intra-Air Force project
      codes to augment repair and distribution decisions at the wholesale level of supply.
      The use of JCS (9**) and Intra-Air Force (7**) project codes are restricted to units
      that are currently assigned, or may be assigned, a contingency tasking. JCS/Intra-Air
      Force project codes are assigned to selected ILS-S Readiness Spares Package (RSP)
      and Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) replenishment requisition (A0*) transactions
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             421


        that require priority management attention. In the ILS-S, JCS/Intra-Air Force project
        codes are programmatically assigned to requisitions via assignment of a JCS Project
        Flag.
           5.2.38.2.12.1. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project flag. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
           (JCS) Project Flag serves several purposes. First, the JCS project flag identifies
           units either engaged or preparing to engage in combat air operations, or units
           enforcing a “no-fly” zone within an established resupply pipeline that are not
           actively engaged in combat air operations. Secondly, the JCS project flag
           determines the amount of RSP or peacetime operating stock (POS) replenishment
           requisitions (if any) which will contain the JCS project code. JCS project flags
           assigned to stock numbers are located on the ILS-S item record (101-Forecast-
           Acquisition-Cost) and displayed on the item record inquiry (JCS Project). JCS
           project flags assigned to RSP records are located on the MRSP/IRSP control
           record (025-JCS-Proj-Flag). The JCS project flag is authorized and assigned as
           described in the following paragraphs.
               5.2.38.2.12.1.1. JCS project flag A. JCS project flag A is authorized for use
               by units engaged in combat or where combat is imminent. JCS project flag A
               indicates 100 percent of the replenishment requisition (A0*) transactions for
               POS and/or RSP authorizations are authorized a JCS/Intra-Air Force project
               code. JCS project flag A may be assigned at both the item record (stock
               number) and RSP authorization levels. AF/A4LM is the approval authority
               for assignment of JCS project flag A.
               5.2.38.2.12.1.2. JCS project flag B. JCS project flag B is authorized for use
               by units that are not actively engaged, but preparing to engage in combat air
               operations. JCS project flag B indicates that 50 percent of the RSP authorized
               quantity may be requisitioned with JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes.
               Therefore, each RSP replenishment requisition transaction produced will
               contain a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code when total base assets (on-hand)
               and JCS/Intra-Air Force project coded due-in (requisition) quantities are less
               than 50 percent of the RSP authorized quantity. Total base assets include:
               serviceable balance; MSK; IRSP; MRSP; HPMSK; WCDO; special spares;
               firm due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM); and deployed items. Note: When 50
               percent of the RSP quantity does not equal a whole number (i.e., 3/2 = 1 ½),
               the fractional number is rounded upward to the next whole number. JCS
               project flag ‘B’ is authorized on airborne and non-airborne MRSP, IRSP, and
               HPMSK details. However, JCS project flag B is not authorized for
               assignment at the item record (stock number) level. AF/A4LM is the approval
               authority for assignment of JCS project flag B.
               5.2.38.2.12.1.3. JCS project flag C. JCS project flag C is authorized for use
               by units that are not actively engaged in combat air operations; however, are
               enforcing a no-fly zone within an established resupply pipeline. When JCS
               project flag C is authorized, the next requisition after a stock-out condition
               will contain a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code. JCS Project Flag C flag is
               authorized at both the item record (stock number) and readiness spares
               package (RSP) authorization levels. Assignment of the ‘C’ flag is authorized,
422                                               AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         up to but not earlier than 30 days before the scheduled deployment. The base
         or AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity is the approval authority for
         assignment of JCS project flag C.
         5.2.38.2.12.1.4. JCS project flag Z. JCS project flag Z is programmatically
         assigned to the item record whenever a CPF is processed to blank the item
         record JCS project flag and a WRM-IRSP-SPARES-DETAIL exists. Also the
         JCS project flag Z will be assigned when a WRM-IRSP-SPARES-DETAIL is
         created and the item record has no flag assigned.
         5.2.38.2.12.1.5. Flexible Consumable Item Readiness Spares Packages
         (FCRSP). The authorized unsupportable quantity field in the WCDO detail
         must be considered when calculating the quantity to receive the JCS project
         code on all requisitions. To distinguish FCRSP items from true unsupportable
         quantities FCRSP items must have a work unit code of “FCRSP” loaded on
         the detail and the FCRSP quantity loaded on the unsupportable quantity and
         this quantity will always be assumed to be on hand.
      5.2.38.2.12.2. Determination of JCS authorized requisition quantity. The JCS
      authorized requisition quantity represents the total (by stock number) requisition
      quantity authorized a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code. The ILS-S calculates the
      JCS requisition quantity authorized a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code as follows:
      [Portion of Total Base Need Authorized a JCS/Intra-Air Force Project Code –
      (Total Base Assets)] If the result of the above calculation is positive (greater
      than zero), the difference between the portion of the total base need authorized a
      JCS/Intra-Air Force project code and total base assets will be assigned a
      JCS/intra-Air Force project code. If the result of the above calculation is negative
      (zero or less), the difference represents the number of requisitions currently
      containing a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code that should not have one assigned.
      The application of the above formula is depicted in Figure 5.5
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                     423

             5.2.38.2.12.3. Application of JCS authorized requisition quantity. ILS-S
             requisitioning programs use MRSP, IRSP, and HPMSK due-out details to
             determine the appropriate JCS/Intra-Air Force project code to apply to
 424                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             requisitions. When RSPs or HPMSKs contain less than the authorized quantity
             with no corresponding due-out detail, a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code is
             assigned to the item record for the stock number being replenished. Figure 5.6
             provides an illustration of how the ILS-S applies the JCS authorized requisition
             quantity.

Figure 5.6. Application of JCS Authorized Requisition Quantity.




             5.2.38.2.12.4. JCS project flag and JCS/intra-Air Force project code load,
             change, and delete (CPF) transaction. LRS/Materiel Management Activity
             personnel are authorized to load JCS project flags A and C to stock numbers (item
             records), and JCS project flags A, B, and C, to ILS-S MRSP and IRSP control
             records. CPF transactions are used to assign JCS project codes and project flags
             to item records. 1EB transactions are used to assign JCS project codes and flags
             to IRSP/MRSP records. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3 for additional information
             about 1EB transactions. See Para 5.2.61 for format and processing instructions
             for the JCS Project Flag and JCS/Intra-Air Force project code load, change, and
             delete (CPF) transaction. If the stock number is part of an Interchangeable &
             Substitute Group (ISG), the ILS-S will automatically assign the JCS project flag
             and JCS/Intra-Air Force project code to the master (M) and all interchangeable (I)
             coded stock numbers in the group. However, for bachelor items and substitute (S)
             coded items, the retail system will assign the JCS project flag and JCS/Intra-Air
             Force project code to the input stock number only. Note: Both the JCS project
             flag and JCS/Intra-Air Force project code must be assigned to the ILS-S item
             record or the CPF transaction will reject.
             5.2.38.2.12.5. Replenishment requisition - POS level requirements. The ILS-S
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                425


           will assign the JCS project code to the item record and the replenishment
           requisition (A0*) transaction when authorized. The JCS project code assigned to
           requisitions is dependent upon the specific flag assigned.
               5.2.38.2.12.5.1. Replenishment requisition - RSP level requirements. If an
               RSP or HPMSK requires replenishment requisitioning with a JCS/Intra-Air
               Force project code, the ILS-S assigns the JCS/Intra-Air Force project code
               assigned to the MRSP/IRSP serial number control record applicable to the
               RSP authorization being replenished. The ILS-S creates a requisition (A0*)
               transaction (with the corresponding RSP (MRSP/IRSP/HPMSK) JCS/Intra-
               Air Force project code) with a requisition quantity to bring the on-hand
               quantity up to the JCS authorized level quantity. Concurrently, the ILS-S will
               create another requisition and due-in detail and requisition (A0*) transaction
               for the remaining replenishment quantity required with the appropriate RSP
               project code (122, 123, 3AA). Note:           Replenishment requisitions for
               JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes and flags created for ERRCD XD* items
               will always be for a quantity of one (1), regardless of the due-out detail
               quantity.
               5.2.38.2.12.5.2. Replenishment requisition – remaining requirements above
               the JCS authorized requisition quantity. Replenishment requisitions for
               requisition quantities required above the JCS authorized requisition quantity,
               but less than the total base requirement, will not contain a JCS/Intra-Air Force
               project code. Replenishment requisitions for ERRCD XB*or XF* items are
               not restricted to a quantity of one. Therefore, the requisition quantity is not
               split between separate requisition (A0*) transactions. Instead, the ILS-S
               assigns a JCS/Intra-Air Force project code, even when the total required
               requisition quantity is above the authorized JCS authorized requisitioning
               level.
           5.2.38.2.12.6. Batch update of JCS/intra-Air Force project codes. In some cases,
           JCS project flags and JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes must be changed. For
           example, AF/A4LM approves the assignment of JCS project flag A or B, a local
           decision is made to assign JCS project flag C, or AF/A4LM directs the removal of
           assigned JCS project flag A or B. When JCS project flags require modification
           (load/change/delete), a batch program must be processed. The R76 (NGV775) is
           the process used to modify the JCS project flags and JCS/Intra-Air Force project
           codes on replenishment requisition (A0*) transactions. The R76 is an “as-
           required” program that reviews existing stock and RSP replenishment due-ins to
           determine if any should be upgraded to a JCS project code or downgraded from
           the JCS project code. The R76 program will format due-in updates (DIT
           transactions) that will upgrade/downgrade due-ins/requisitions. The AFMC
           SCM-R Stock Control Activity or the WRM section must notify AFMC SCM-R
           Computer Operations Activity to schedule and process the R76. See AFH 23-123
           Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for specific instructions for processing the R76.
        5.2.38.2.13. Requisition Advice Code. The requisition advice code indicates to the
        source of supply a specific condition is required to ensure a desired supply result. For
        example, requisition advice code 2B (do not substitute) informs the source of supply
426                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         to provide the requested item only or cancel the requisition. Requisition advice code
         2D (exact quantity) informs the source of supply to furnish the exact quantity
         requested only or cancel the requisition. See Para 5.2.45 for a list and explanation of
         requisition advice codes available for use. Additionally, processing instructions are
         also provided.
  5.2.39. Requisition Cost, Quantity, And Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) Edits And
  Processing Instructions.
      5.2.39.1. Purpose. To describe how the ILS-S applies requisition cost, quantity, and
      quantity unit pack (QUP) edits to base requisition (A0*) transactions.
      5.2.39.2. Requisition Quantity and Cost Edits for Supply Items. The requisition (A0*)
      transaction DIC may be assigned based upon ILS-S cost and quantity edits. The
      following items or conditions will cause the ILS-S to change the requisition document
      identifier code (DIC) to “A0E” for CONUS bases or “A05” for OCONUS bases. The
      ILS-S enters the letters QTY in positions 68-70 of the output requisition (A0*)
      transaction.
      5.2.39.3. Requisition Quantity and Cost Edits for Equipment Items. Normally, when the
      ILS-S produces a requisition for an equipment item, it also checks to see if the quantity is
      reasonable. The system will not do a reasonable quantity check for items containing a
      blank budget code (AFMC investment items) or budget codes A-H, J-U, or W-X. Stock
      fund dollars are not utilized for these items so quantity or cost edits are not performed. If
      an equipment item (ERRCD N**) costs more than $999.99, the ILS-S changes the
      document identifier code (DIC) to A0E for CONUS bases or to A05 for OCONUS bases
      and places three dollar signs ($$$) in positions 68-70 of the requisition.
      5.2.39.4. Processing Requisitions with Cost and/or Quantity Edits. The AFMC SCM-R
      Stock Control Activity will ensure the requisition quantity and cost are correct. If
      correct, manually blank positions 68-70, change the document identifier code (DIC) as
      required, and send the requisition (A0*) transaction to the source of supply. For
      example, change the DIC to A0A (CONUS) or A01 (OCONUS) for stock number
      requisitions as applicable. If QTY appears in positions 68-70, Stock Control will ensure
      the quantity is valid. If valid, Stock Control will enter advice code 2L in positions 65-66
      and blank positions 68-80. The 2L requisition advice code will prevent DLA maximum
      release quantity (MRQ) edits from incorrectly canceling requisitions with a valid quantity
      using status code CS. Status code CS indicates that requisition quantities appear to be
      invalid or excessive. See Para 5.2.88 for more information.
      5.2.39.5. Quantity and Cost Edits for Customer Due-Out (UND A/B) Requirements. The
      following explains QUP processing concerning due-out requirements containing budget
      code 9.
         5.2.39.5.1. Requisition Advice Code Other Than 2D, 2N, 34, and Blank. If the due-
         out detail contains a requisition advice code other than 2D, 2N, 34, or blank, the QUP
         will be applied to due-out requirements with budget code 9 (UND A and B). The
         ILS-S will increase the requisition quantity to a quantity equally divisible by the
         quantity unit pack on the output requisition (A0*) transaction. Table 5.47 provides
         examples of how ILS-S requisitions are adjusted by quantity unit pack edits.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   427


          5.2.39.5.2. Requisition Advice Code 2D, 2N, 34, and Blank. If the due-out detail
          contains advice code 2D or blank, or if the quantity is not equally divisible by the
          quantity unit pack, the ILS-S requisitions the due-out quantity and assigns advice
          code 2D to the output requisition (A0*) transaction. If the due-out detail contains
          requisition advice codes 2N or 34, the ILS-S requisitions the due-out quantity and
          applies the due-out advice code to the output requisition (A0*) transaction.
          5.2.39.5.3. Stock Replenishment Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) Processing. For stock
          replenishment requisitions (including due-out requirements with UND C), the ILS-S
          adjusts the requisition quantity to a quantity equally divisible by the QUP. If the
          requisition quantity is less than 50 percent of the QUP, the required quantity is
          requisitioned. If the required quantity is greater than 50 percent of the QUP, but less
          than one unit pack, the requisition quantity is adjusted to one unit pack. The
          remaining requisition quantity, if any, is adjusted to the next nearest quantity unit
          pack, unless one of the following conditions exists:
              5.2.39.5.3.1. The remainder is less than 50 percent of one quantity unit pack.
              5.2.39.5.3.2. The requisition objective (RO) has been adjusted by a minimum
              adjusted stock level (ASL). See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stock Procedures for
              more information concerning the RO and minimum ASLs.
              5.2.39.5.3.3. The requisition quantity adjustment exceeds one year's requirement.
              Table 5.47 shows how the ILS-S uses the quantity unit pack to adjust
              requisitioning quantities.

       5.2.39.6. Quantity and Cost Edits for Customer Due-Out (UND C) Requirements. For
       UND C requirements when the requisition objective (RO) is either zero or greater than
       the product of the (DDR) times 365, the ILS-S will not apply the quantity unit pack.
       Rather, the output requisition (A0*) transaction or fund requirement (FRC) image will
       contain the requisitioned quantity (not adjusted by the QUP) and requisition advice code
       2D.
       5.2.39.7. Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) Policy for Slow-Moving Items. Air Force policy
       specifies the use of quantity unit pack (QUP) quantities whenever possible. However, for
       some slow-moving items, an automated QUP requisition quantity adjustment could
       produce requisitions that exceed base requirements. Slow-moving items whose quantity
       should not be automatically adjusted to the nearest QUP require assignment of a locally-
       determined requisition exception (REX) code to the item, and a requisition exception

       phrase record (override) containing requisition advice code 2D and exception notice code
       (ENC) P. A combination of these actions will stop the ILS-S from adjusting the
       requisition quantity to the QUP. See Para 5.2.45 for more information concerning
       requisition advice codes. See Ch 5 for more information concerning REX codes and
       exception phrase records.
   5.2.40. Requisition Serial Number Assignment.
       5.2.40.1. Purpose. To provide requisition serial number assignment information for use
       on ILS-S requisitions and other AFMC SCM-R/LRS/Materiel Management Activity
       transactions, such as follow-ups, redistribution orders, status, etc. See AFH 23-122, Vol

     5.2.42. Requisition Demand Codes.
        5.2.42.1. Purpose. To explain automated demand code assignment on ILS-S output
        requisition (A0*) transactions and provide guidance for assigning requisition demand
        codes to manual (offline) requisition transactions.
   430                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.2.42.1.1. Demand Codes Assigned to Automated (Inline) Requisitions. If left
             blank, the ILS-S programmatically assigns the requisition demand code to output
             (automated) requisition (A0*) transactions as explained in Table 5.51

  Table 5.51. Demand Codes Assigned to System Output Requisitions.
   Code       Explanation
   N          Nonrecurring Demand. One-time requirement or initial request for
              stockage. The ILS-S considers demand code N requisitions as non-
              recurring demands. The customer demand should not be included in RO
              computations.
   O          Nonrecurring Demand. A request to identify initial sized clothing and
              war reserve materiel (WRM) requirements to the wholesaler. Applies to
              Federal Supply Group (FSG) 83 and 84. Note: Not applicable to Federal
              Supply Class 8475. Demand code O should be used only on the first
              special requisition for sized clothing.
   P          Nonrecurring Demand for Special Program Requirements. A request for
              special program or special requirement items previously stocked by the
              ICP.
   R          Recurring Demand. An item periodically required by the customer. The
              requested items will be for bench stock consumption, active requirements,
              or stock replenishment. Note: Assign demand code R to customer
              requests if there is any doubt to the type of demand.
             5.2.42.1.2. Demand Code Assignment for Manual (Offline) Requisitions. Stock
             Control must assign the correct demand code to each manual (offline) special
             requisition (SPR) input and output requisitions. Table 5.52 provides specific
             guidelines for assigning the correct demand code based upon the input transaction
             identification code (TRIC).

       5.2.43. Requisition Priority Designator Assignment.
          5.2.43.1. Purpose. To explain the procedures used by the ILS-S to determine and assign
          requisition priority designators to requisitions.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                431


     5.2.43.2. Requisition Priority Designator Assignment. The ILS-S assigns requisition
     priority designators based upon Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System
     (UMMIPS) standards. This paragraph provides an overall picture of the factors used to
     determine the correct requisition priority, and processing time standards for all elements
     of the requisition pipeline.
        5.2.43.2.1. Priority Designator Assignment for Due-Out Requisitions. The priority
        designator assigned to ILS-S requisitions for due-out requirements) depends on two
        elements: the urgency of need designator (UND) and force activity designator
        (FAD). The UND is the first position of the customer issue request urgency
        justification code (UJC). The FAD is taken from one of the following: 1) the issue
        request, or 2) the organizational cost center record (OCCR) if the FAD is blank on the
        customer issue request.
        5.2.43.2.2. Priority Designator Assignment for Stock Replenishment Requisitions.
        Stock replenishment requisitions are normally assigned requisition priority
        designators 11 through 15 based on the FAD loaded in the base constants record
        (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 6). The ILS-S assigns the requisition priority to stock
        replenishment requisitions as follows:
            5.2.43.2.2.1. First Position (position 60). The ILS-S places a constant 1 in the
            first position of the requisition priority designator.
            5.2.43.2.2.2. Second Position (position 61). The ILS-S determines the FAD code
            from the ILS-S Base Constants record and places it in the second (last) position of
            the requisition priority designator on the output requisition (A0*) transaction. For
            example, if the base FAD code is 2, the stock replenishment requisition priority
            will be 12.
        5.2.43.2.3. Priority Designator Assignment for Deferred Requirements. ILS-S
        requisitions for deferred requirements (special projects, pre-positioned, war reserve)
        will contain requisition priority designator 99 in positions 60-61.
        5.2.43.2.4. Other Priority Designator Assignment for Stock Replenishment
        Requisitions. The ILS-S assigns requisition priority designators other than 11-15 for
        stock replenishment requisitions as follows:
            5.2.43.2.4.1. Priority Designator 05. Priority designator 05 is programmatically
            assigned to IRSP off-set quantity stock replenishment requisitions.
            5.2.43.2.4.2. Priority Designator 06. Priority designator 06 is programmatically
            assigned to stock replenishment requisitions if the item contains a shelf life code
            of (A-F) or is designated an airlift investment item. Additionally, the quantity of
            requisitioned items must be less than the Reorder Point (ROP) and the quantity of
            assets on hand is less than the computed safety level. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec
            2B, Stockage Procedure for more information concerning the computation of the
            ROP and safety level. The ILS-S assigns requisition priority designator 06
            automatically to other types of items as explained in the following paragraphs:
                5.2.43.2.4.2.1. Air Force Critical Items. If the item is designated an Air Force
                critical item (RAMPS report code 5 or 7), the ILS-S automatically assigns a
432                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


                minimum requisition priority designator 06 to output requisition (A0*)
                transactions.
                5.2.43.2.4.2.2. Agile Logistics/Two-Level Maintenance (AL/2LM) Items. If
                the item is designated an AL or 2LM, a minimum requisition priority
                designator of 06 is automatically assigned to output requisition (A0*)
                transactions. . See Figure 5.7 for a matrix used to determine the requisition
                priority designator, project code, and required delivery date assigned to ILS-S
                requisitions.
             5.2.43.2.4.3. Priority Designator 08. Priority designator 08 is programmatically
             assigned to requisitions that qualify for RDD 777 and project code 780 or 880
             when the computed supply priority is greater than 08 (09-15). Qualified
             requisitions include those for ERRCD XD* when the budget code equals 8, O, S,
             T, U, W or X; ERRCD XF3 with budget code 8 or 9, and the 101-Hazardous-
             Materiel-Code is blank; and ERRCD XB* or XF* items, with budget code 8 or 9,
             that qualify for fast transportation in accordance with AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B,
             Stockage Procedure. See Para 5.2.44 for more information about RDD 777
             assignment.
             5.2.43.2.4.4. Priority Designator 09. Priority designator 09 is programmatically
             assigned to stock replenishment requisitions if the item is (ERRCD XD*/XF*).
             Additionally, there are no assets on hand, and the item or group of
             interchangeable items has had a total of six or more demands during the last five
             (5) quarters.
  5.2.44. Required Delivery Date (RDD) Assignment, Usage, and Processing Instructions.
      5.2.44.1. Purpose. To list and explain the assignment of the RDD on ILS-S requisitions
      for both customer (due-out) and stock replenishment (due-in) requirements. Usage
      information and processing instructions is also provided.
      5.2.44.2. Required Delivery Date (RDD). The RDD is used to specify the actual need
      date of the requirement requisitioned when incompatible with the Standard Delivery Date
      (SDD). Additionally, the RDD provides expedite movement instructions to the
      LRS/transportation activity. General RDD assignment and usage on ILS-S requisitions is
      as follows:
         5.2.44.2.1. RDD 999. RDD 999 indicates expedited handling requirement for
         Mission Capable (MICAP) Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) requirement from
         an overseas (OCONUS) customer.
         5.2.44.2.2. RDD N**. RDD N** indicates expedited handling due to NMCS
         requirement from a stateside (CONUS) customer. The last two positions of the RDD
         will contain the urgency justification code from the customer issue request. For
         example, a CONUS MICAP requisition for aircraft will normally contain required
         delivery date (RDD) NAA.
         5.2.44.2.3. RDD E**. RDD E** indicates expedited handling due to anticipated
         NMCS engine requirement from a CONUS customer.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             433


        5.2.44.2.4. RDD 555. RDD 555 indicates expedited handling due to mass requisition
        cancellation requirements from a CONUS customer.
        5.2.44.2.5. RDD 444. RDD 444 indicates expedited handling for customer
        requirements co-located with the storage activity, or for locally negotiated
        requirement dated requirements.
        5.2.44.2.6. RDD Blank. A blank RDD indicates routine transportation handling.
        5.2.44.2.7. RDD 777. RDD 777 is used to identify requisitions authorized expedited
        transportation handling at the source of supply. This RDD is assigned to requisitions
        by the ILS-S when any of the conditions listed in the following paragraphs are met.
        Note: ILS-S requisitioning program logic will automatically blank the RDD if an
        attempt is made to manually assign RDD 777 for requisitions that do not meet RDD
        777 assignment criteria.
        5.2.44.2.7.1. AL/2LM Requisitions. RDD 777 will be assigned to output requisition
        (A0*) transactions automatically when items are identified as AL/2LM. These items
        can be identified when the repair cycle record contains an AL/2LM flag of A, B, C, or
        D in the ILS-S repair cycle record (102) LEVEL-OF-MAINTENANCE field. Note:
        See Ch 5 for more information.
           5.2.44.2.7.2. RDD 777 and Project Code 880. RDD 777 may be used with
           project code 880 for ILS-S requisitions. Project code 880 normally identifies
           AFMC-managed (ERRCD XD*/XF*/XB*) assets that do not meet any other
           criteria for assignment of RDD 777 as explained in the following paragraphs.
               5.2.44.2.7.2.1. RDD 777 and project code 880 will be programmatically
               assigned to output requisition (A0*) transactions automatically when the
               ERRCD is XD*, the budget code equals 8, O, S, T, U, W or X, and the
               requisition does not meet any other edit criteria for assignment of RDD of
               777.
               5.2.44.2.7.2.2. RDD 777 and project code 880 will be programmatically
               assigned to the backorder output requisition (A0*) transaction when the
               ERRCD is XF3, the budget code equals 8 or 9, and the 101-Hazardous-
               Materiel-Code is blank.
               5.2.44.2.7.2.3. RDD 777 and project code 880 will be programmatically
               assigned to the OCONUS AWP backorder output requisition (A0*)
               transactions when the ERRCD is XB3, the budget code equals 8 or 9, and
               the101-Hazardous-Materiel-Code is blank.
               5.2.44.2.7.2.4. RDD 777 and project code 780. RDD 777 and project code
               780 will be programmatically assigned to stock replenishment output
               requisition (A0*) transactions when the ILS-S item record (101) FAST-
               TRANS-DENIAL-CODE position is ”F”, the ERRCD is XB* or XF*, and the
               budget code equals 8 or 9. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure
               for details about the assignment of the fast transportation denial code.
           5.2.44.2.7.3. RDD 777 will be programmatically assigned to stock replenishment
           requisitions if the item contains a shelf life code of (A-F) or is designated an
434                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             airlift investment item. Additionally, the quantity of requisitioned items must be
             less than the ROP and the quantity of assets on hand is less than the computed
             safety level.
      5.2.44.3. RDD for Lateral Support Requisitions. For non-MICAP lateral support
      requisitions (RIC equals D** ) supporting customer due-out requirements, the RDD will
      consist of the force activity designator (FAD) and the UJC from the due-out detail.
      5.2.44.4. RDD Incompatible with Standard Delivery Date (SDD). When the RDD is not
      consistent with the standard delivery date (SDD) of the UMMIPS priority group, the
      required delivery date may be used on requisitions. If the RDD is earlier than the SDD,
      the actual required delivery date indicated on the issue request will be entered on the
      requisition.
      5.2.44.5. RDD for Long Lead-Time Requirements. Some items, such as those required
      at a future date or for support of special projects and programs, may be requisitioned well
      in advance of the actual RDD. Output requisition (A0*) transactions for items not
      immediately required must contain the following information:
         5.2.44.5.1. Extended RDD. The extended RDD is used to show the number of
         months required for the lead time. The extended RDD will consist of an X in the first
         position and the number of months lead time required in the last two positions. For
         example, if the extended RDD is 24 months from the date identified in the requisition
         document number date field, the RDD will contain X24. For sources of supply, the
         extended RDD will always depict the last day of the last month when the item is
         required. For example, an item required on Note:            The extended RDD for
         requisitions supporting initial support of weapon systems or equipment must contain
         X03. Initial Spares Support List (ISSL) Major Command Spares Support List
         (MSSL), and Non-Airborne Spares Support List (NASSL) requisition requirements
         apply.
         5.2.44.5.2. RDD and Specific Shipment Release Date. In some cases, bases may
         desire shipments to be held until 50 days prior to the RDD. The RDD will consist of
         an S in the first position and the number of months remaining until the estimated
         Shipment Release Date. For example, RDD S02 will indicate the materiel is required
         two months from the requisition date.
  5.2.45. Requisition Advice Codes.
      5.2.45.1. Purpose. To identify and explain requisition advice codes used on ILS-S
      requisitions. The requisition advice code is used to notify the source of supply of specific
      processing instructions required for submitted requisition (A0*) transactions. See Table
      5.53 for more information concerning requisition advice codes.
         5.2.45.1.1. Equipment Investment Items. Every requisition (A0*) transaction created
         for Air Force investment equipment (ERRCD ND*/NF*) items must have the correct
         advice code.
         5.2.45.1.2. DIT Input. To change a requisition advice code, use a due-in/due-out
         update (DIT) input. See Para. 5.2.71 for the DIT transaction format and processing
         instructions.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             435


Table 5.53. Requisition Advice Codes.
 Code     Description
 2A       The item cannot be obtained locally through manufacture, fabrication, or
          procurement. If the item record contains requisition exception code 2, the
          ILS-S automatically assigns requisition advice code 2A to the requisition.
 2B       Do not substitute or interchange - only the requested item will do. This
          instruction also applies to obsolete items which were previously rejected
          with status code CJ. If the ISU input transaction contains TEX code T, the
          ILS-S automatically assigns requisition advice code 2B.
 2C       Do not back order. Reject the unfilled quantity that is not available by the
          RDD. Fill or kill.
 2D       Furnish the exact quantity requested. Do not adjust to quantity unit pack.
 2E       Free issue. Stock lists and other publications offer this materiel without
          reimbursement.
 2F       The item has been coded obsolete, but still required for immediate use. A
          Service-approved substitute is acceptable. If the supply source cannot
          procure the item, reject the requisition with status code CJ.
 2G       Multiple use:
          (1) Ship new stocks or stocks having new appearance.
          (2) Strategic mission requires newest and latest model and configuration
          (electron tubes).
          (3) Strategic mission requires newest stock only (photographic materiel).
          (4) Anticipated use requires latest expiration dates only (biological).
 2H       Multiple use:
          (1) Special textile requirements for use in airborne operations.
          (2) Commissary resale item.
 2J       Do not substitute or back order. Fill or kill.
 2K       The item is being requisitioned from CONUS pursuant to the Balance of
          Payments program. Note: Only overseas (OCONUS) retail materiel
          management activities may use requisition advice code 2K.
 2L       The quantity shown in the quantity field exceeds normal demands;
          however, this is a confirmed requirement.
 2M       This requisition is submitted on a fill or kill basis for items located in
          DLADS and advertised by DLADS. Items in equal or better condition
          than the code in positions 21-22 are acceptable. However, if the
          requisitioner and DLADS have agreed about the condition of materiel
          acceptable to the requisitioner, the two-position condition code will not be
          required.
 2N       The item is required in one continuous length (positions 25-29) and unit of
436                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      issue (positions 23-24). Other arrangements and/or multiples of the
      quantity unit packs are not acceptable.
2P    The item is required in one continuous length (positions 25-29) and the
      unit of issue (positions 23-24). If the requirement exceeds the quantity unit
      pack length, multiples of the quantity unit pack are acceptable.
2T    Deliver the item to the ultimate consignee by the Standard Delivery Date
      (SDD), or Required Delivery Date (RDD) listed on the requisition.
      Otherwise, cancel the requisition.
6A    Request shipment of reparable material. Fill or kill. See Note.
6B    Request shipment of Technical Order Compliance (TOC) materiel. Fill or
      kill. See Note.
6C    If the supply source cannot guarantee the item will be available before the
      priority or required delivery date has expired, reject the requisition and
      provide a supply source that will have the item available for the
      requisitioner to buy. Base funds will purchase the item. See Note.
6D    Request for shipment of incomplete (INC) materiel. Fill or kill. See Note.
6E    The item is required to replace an item lost to the equipment, that is,
      Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD), and other relief of accountability
      documents. See Note.
6F    The item is required for issue to a non-EAID reporting function or agency;
      that is, CE real property, bench mockup, training device, or other
      governmental agencies, NASA, Army, Navy, etc., and contractors. This
      code applies only to P activity code requests. See Note.
6G    The item is required to replace a TA authorization (EAID). This code is
      used only if the equipment item in-use is turned in and is no longer
      reported to AFEMS as in-use. If the replacement item which is being
      ordered must be received before the in-use item can be turned in, use
      advice codes 6R or 6S instead. Use this code only with demand code R.
      See Note.
6H    The item is required to fill a shortage that resulted from an increase in
      authorization in the Allowance Standard (AS). Use this code only with
      demand code I. See Note.
6J    The item is required to fill an added authorization to the Allowance
      Standard (AS). Use this code only with Demand Code I. See Note.
6K    The item is required for an Awaiting Parts (AWP) end item. See Note.
6L    The item is required for an Awaiting Parts (AWP) end item (not to be
      killed). See Note.
6Q    The item is required for calibration, repair, and return.
6R    A complete overhaul of an ERRCD ND* item is required to check
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              437


           performance, safety, and efficiency. Before the item can be released for
           the overhaul, the replacement item must be available. See Note.
6S         Repair costs for an ERRCD NF* item exceed economic repair
           requirements. Because of operational requirements, the item in use cannot
           be condemned before the replacement is received. See Note.
6X         If the lateral support base cannot provide the item, it back-orders the item
           from the source of supply. The ILS-S uses this advice code for lateral
           support requisitioning only. See Note.
6Y         Fill or backorder the requested quantity and update cumulative recurring
           demands at the lateral support base. Applies to Economic Order Quantity
           (EOQ) items only. See NOTE.
6Z         This item is required to replace a routed repair item. Applies to Depot
           Materiel Management activities only. Order Fill or Kill.

62         Materiel requisitioned is for replacing installed equipment in next higher
           assembly. See Note.
64         Used on Contingency requisitions submitted to the supporting base.
           Requisitions are processed by the supporting base as a fill or pass, and
           shipments are processed to zero balance. See Note.
Note: These requisition advice codes may be assigned for intra-Air Force transaction
use only. Other Services (Army/Navy/Marines) will not recognize Air Force
requisition advice codes. It is mandatory to use the correct advice code on
requisitions for equipment items (ERRCD ND*/NF*).
  5.2.46. Uniform Materiel Movement And Issue Priority Standards (UMMIPS).
      5.2.46.1. Purpose. This explains how Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority
      Standards (UMMIPS) are used to determine processing time and establish baselines for
 438                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       each segment of the requisition pipeline. UMMIPS standards are normally based upon
       requisition priority designator, Required Delivery Date (RDD), and base location.
       5.2.46.2. Force Activity Designator (FAD) and Urgency of Need (UND) Conversion
       Charts. The FAD for Air Force and Military Assistance Program (MAP) activities and
       projects is determined by the precedence ratings assigned by HQ USAF/PR and
       published in current Program Documents.

5.2.46.4. Priority Designator 01-03 and RDD 999 for Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)
Requisitions and Shipments. The following UMMIPS standards are used to determine
processing time for each segment of the Mission Capable (MICAP) requisition pipeline.
UMMIPS time standards for MICAP requirements are based upon requisition priority designator,
base location, and RDD.

Figure 5.8. PD 01-03 NMCS and RDD 999 for Requisitions and Shipments.




      5.2.47. Requisition Exception (REX) Codes.
442                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.47.1. Purpose. To list and explain REX codes used in the ILS-S to suppress and/or
      modify automatic requisitions.
      5.2.47.2. REX Code Assignment Criteria. REX codes are a one-position, alpha/numeric
      code assigned to stock numbers to restrict or modify output requisition (A0*)
      transactions. Requisition exception codes and requisition exception phrase records are
      loaded and assigned as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. Note: The retail
      Materiel Management Activity function responsible for monitoring each REX code must
      prepare and maintain an exception control (ECC) image for each item when required.
      REX codes may be manually loaded, changed, or deleted with a stock control data (FCD)
      transaction. See Ch 2 for format and processing instructions for FCD transactions.
      5.2.47.3. Suppress Automatic Requisitioning. REX codes 1, 3, and 4 will cause the ILS-
      S to suppress requisition (A0*) transactions, regardless of the assigned exception notice
      code (ENC). However, requisitions are suppressed for all REX-coded items if ENC R
      (Reject) is assigned. REX codes are also used to identify requisitions which require
      external management review before submission. Assignment of ENC P (Process) to the
      REX exception phrase record will cause the ILS-S to enter the REX code in position 71
      of the output requisition (A0*) transaction. Before submitting the output requisition
      (A0*) transaction to the supply source, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must
      blank position 71. Note: This does not apply to local purchase requisition transactions
      printed on DD 1348-1A.
      5.2.47.4. Requisition Override Records. Requisition exception (REX) codes may also be
      used to force the ILS-S to override normal requisition data as specified by the exception
      phrase record. Requisition exception phrase records loaded for this purpose are identified
      as requisition override records. Any alpha requisition exception code may be used as a
      requisition override record. Properly established requisition override records will
      improve local requisitioning and reduce the need for manual (offline) requisitions.
      Conversely, improper requisition override records will generate invalid requisitions and
      internal records. Use exception notice code (ENC) P (process) when you create
      requisition override records. Note: Do not use ENC R (reject) because the ILS-S will
      reject the requisition transaction. For each requisition override record, create an ECC
      image that supports the assigned requisition override. See Ch 2 for more information
      concerning creating and maintaining ECC images.
         5.2.47.4.1. Exception Phrase Record (EPR). The Exception Phrase Record (EPR) is
         used to explain the reason for requisition overrides or modifiers. The AFMC SCM-R
         publishes EPRs in their electronic EEC Program. When normal requisitioning
         procedures do not satisfy local requirements, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
         may also use exception phrase records and requisition override/modifier records to
         override the system designator, project code, routing identifier code, supplementary
         address, priority designator, and advice code on requisitions. For example, you may
         use a requisition modifier on requisitions when a specific supplementary address is
         required. To establish exception phrase records and requisition override and modifier
         records, follow the instructions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
         5.2.47.4.2. Exception Notice Code (ENC). The exception notice code (ENC) is
         contained on each exception phrase record in the ILS-S. The ENC is used to augment
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               443


        REX codes and to either stop (ENC R) or allow (ENC P) requisition processing.
        Exception notice code R will “reject” any attempt to automatically requisition the
        item. Exception notice code P will “process” and produce either a requisition (A0*)
        transaction or Fund Requirement (FRC) image. The ILS-S will place the assigned
        REX code in position 71 of the requisition (A0*) transaction. AFMC SCM-R Stock
        Control Activity must blank the REX code from the requisition transaction before
        submission to the source of supply. Note:         If the exception phrase contains
        requisition override information, the REX code will not be placed on the requisition
        transaction.
     5.2.47.5. REX Code 1 (Temporary Requisition Suppression). When the source of supply
     cancels a ILS-S requisition, REX code “1” (Do Not Requisition) may be assigned.
     Assignment of REX 1 prevents the creation of any new requisitions until the reason for
     the cancellation is resolved. The ILS-S will automatically assign REX code 1 as a result
     of receiving cancellation status codes CA, CE, CG, CH, CJ, CK, CP, CR, CV, CY, D3,
     FF, FG, FL, FM, FN, FO, FP, FU, FX, ZG, or ZH. See Para 5.2.87.7.2.1 for more
     information concerning cancellation status codes. REX code 1 assignment, if not
     resolved, can negatively affect mission support by suppressing automated requisitions.
     For customer due-out requirements, assignment REX code 1 will cause the ILS-S to
     produce a 350 MGT notice to notify personnel that management attention is required.
     See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and corrective actions for the
     350 MGT notice. If REX code 1 is assigned to the item record, the ILS-S will print the
     previous REX (if any) on the 350 MGT notice. The previous REX code is used to
     indicate which requisition controls must be reassigned to the item record when the
     current cancellation condition (REX 1) is cleared and REX code 1 is removed from the
     item record. If a customer due-out exists and manual re-requisitioning action is required,
     the ILS-S will automatically remove the REX code from the item record upon successful
     processing of a Special Requisition (SPR) transaction or FRC image. Otherwise, AFMC
     SCM-R Stock Control Activity personnel must process a manual Stock Control Data
     Change (FCD) transaction to remove the REX code before re-requisitioning.
     5.2.47.6. REX Codes 4 and 5 (Permanent Requisition Suppression). If a source of
     supply cancels a requisition and indicates permanent requisition suppression applies,
     AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will assign REX code 4 or 5 to suppress all
     requisitioning action. Once assigned, REX 4 or 5 will prevent the ILS-S from producing
     new requisition (A0*) transactions. Note: Assigning Exception Notice Code P to REX
     code 5 will allow an A0* to be created. These requisitions will require external review.
     See Para 5.2.47.4.2 for guidance in processing the A0* that have ENC P assigned to the
     item record. REX codes 4 or 5 may create additional manual workloads for Stock
     Control. Therefore, only assign REX codes 4 or 5 to stock numbers when absolutely
     necessary to permanently suppress output requisition (A0*) transactions. Additionally,
     prior to assigning REX code 4 or 5 to permanently restrict requisitioning action, AFMC
     SCM-R Stock Control Activity personnel must conduct an external review of the stock
     numbers and ensure requisition suppression is appropriate.
     5.2.47.7. Effect of Requisition Override Records on Requisitions. If a requisition
     override record exists for a stock number being requisitioned, the ILS-S uses the data
     from the requisition override and exception phrase records to modify the output
 444                                                         AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       requisition (A0*) transaction. The ILS-S does not perform edits to check the accuracy of
       requisition override record data. Note: If a stock replenishment flag (*) appears in the
       ILS-S Exception Phrase Record (003) STOCK-REPLENISHMENT-FLG field, the
       system will modify stock replenishment requisitions. If a customer due-out flag (*)
       appears in the 003 DUO-REPLENISHMENT-FLG field, the ILS-S will modify
       requisitions established for all customer due-out requirements. If the available override
       fields on the exception phrase record are not blank, the ILS-S will perform the following
       actions:
           5.2.47.7.1. Project Code. A project code (if designated) is assigned to the requisition
           (A0*) transaction and corresponding due-in detail.
           5.2.47.7.2. System Designator. A system designator is assigned to each requisition
           (A0*) transaction. For stock replenishment requisitions, the ILS-S applies the item
           record system designator to the requisition.
           5.2.47.7.3. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). A routing identifier code (RIC) is
           assigned or modified to the requisition (A0*) transaction and corresponding due-in
           detail. The ILS-S applies the RIC specified on the exception phrase record to
           determine where and how to submit the requisition. Note: If UND A requisition
           override records specify different than normal sources of supply, (override record
           equals Y), the routing identifier information from the REX override record will be
           applied. If the requisition override record does not contain RIC information, the RIC
           from the ILS-S Item Record (101) will be used.
           5.2.47.7.4. Requisition Priority Designator. A requisition priority designator is
           assigned to the requisition and due-in details if the requisition priority designator is
           not blank in the exception phrase record. If the requisition priority designator is
           blank, the ILS-S will determine and apply the correct requisition priority designator
           using a combination of the FAD and UND.
           5.2.47.7.5. Requisition Advice Code. When applied to requisition override records, a
           requisition advice code is assigned to the requisition (A0*) transaction and the
           corresponding due-in detail. See Para 5.2.45 for a list of requisition advice codes
           used on ILS-S requisitions.

Notes:
1. Individual exception control (ECC) images are not required when the ILS-S assigns REX code
1 as a result of processing MILSTRIP status. REX code 1 must be monitored. If a requisition
must be permanently suppressed, process a Stock Control Data Change (FCD) transaction to
change the REX code to 4 or 5.
 446                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


 2. Individual ECC images are not required when the ILS-S assigns REX 3 as a result of
 processing stock list changes received through the stock number user directory (SNUD). Retain a
 copy of the 036 (End of Job), 037 (Reserved), 045 (Reserved) REJ notice, or F470 MGT notice
 (BVD03) in stock number sequence until action is taken to delete the stock number from the ILS-
 S. If the stock number is not deleted, change to REX code 4.
 3. Individual ECC images are not required for stock numbers under the following conditions:
 a. REX code 4 is assigned to suppress requisitions for the following items:
 (1) Items assigned budget code V (vehicles).
 (2) Mechanized Materiel Handling Systems (MMHS).
 (3) Bench mock-up/sets.
 (4) Gas Cylinders.
 (5) Constant Shelter Materiel.
 (6) Calendars.
 b. When complete processing instructions are loaded in the nomenclature field; e.g., requisition
 repair kit.
 4. When alpha REX codes are used for purposes other than requisition override, local
 management (AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity, LRS/Materiel Management Activity or
 MAJCOM) will decide how to manage and use the exception phrase record, ENC, and ECC
 image.
 5. Satellite Procurement Flag. The satellite procurement flag is contained on the satellite OCCR
 (000-099). REX code 0 indicates that the stock number contains an exception (opposite) to the
 flag. See Table 5.56. Satellite Procurement below.
 6. ECC images are required to be maintained for each individual item assigned REX code 5
 except when complete processing instructions are loaded in the nomenclature field (for example,
 order bit and pieces).
 7. REX 2 is assigned to items coded local purchase/local manufacture where no local procurement
 source or local manufacture capability exists.

    5.2.48. Requisitioning Shelf Life Coded Items.
       5.2.48.1. Purpose. To explain how shelf life coded items are requisitioned in the ILS-S.
       Shelf life codes may be systematically or manually assigned. Manual assignment of shelf
       life codes is accomplished using a File Maintenance Miscellaneous Data Change (FNL)
       transaction. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 8 for format and processing instructions for
       FNL transactions.
       5.2.48.2. Shelf Life Code for Stock Replenishment Requisitions. The ILS-S uses shelf
       life codes (when applicable) to determine how many items to requisition for stock
       replenishment. The stock replenishment quantity for items assigned a shelf life of less
       than 30 months will not exceed one-half of the item’s shelf life days times the Daily
       Demand Rate (DDR). One-half the shelf life days times the DDR functions as the
       Requisitioning Objective (RO) when determining stock replenishment quantities.
          5.2.48.2.1. Quantity Less than Requisitioning Objective (RO). When one-half the
          shelf life days times the DDR is less than the computed RO, the stock replenishment
          quantity will be the difference between one-half the shelf life days times the DDR
          minus the computed Reorder Level (ROL). See Ch 2 for more information
          concerning the ROL.
 448                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


          5.2.48.2.2. Quantity Greater than Requisitioning Objective (RO). When one-half the
          shelf life days times the DDR is greater than the RO, the stock replenishment quantity
          is the difference between the computed RO minus the computed ROL. Requisitions
          for items containing short (one to six months) shelf life codes A through F and 1 or 2
          will be assigned priority 06 when the normal requisition priority is 07 through 15.
          Note: Shelf life logic is not applied to items in federal supply group (FSG) 75, 79,
          and 85 containing issue exception code (IEX) E.
    5.2.49. Fund/Signal Code Assignment and MACR Adjustment For ILS-S Requisitions.
       5.2.49.1. Purpose. To explain how the ILS-S: 1) assigns fund, signal, and routing
       identifier codes to ILS-S requisitions; 2) adjusts the materiel acquisition control record
       (MACR) as required; and 3) creates received-not-billed (RNB) details as required. Use
       Table 5.57 to determine correct budget, routing identifier, fund, and signal code

do not build RNB details at the time of receipt processing.
2. Budget Code. For budget code Z transactions assigned signal codes A, B, or J, the
ILS-S will automatically update the allotment accounting field in the appropriate
MACR.
3. Fund Code.
a. If the item is funded through a major other procurement appropriation (57*3080),
use fund code 17.
b. If the item is funded through a major Research, Development, Test, and
Evaluation appropriation (57*3600), use fund code 29.
c. If the item is funded through the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)
major appropriation 97*0300.4802, use fund code 8C.
d. Fund codes 30 and 55 shall be used only with specific approval of the Chief of
Staff, United States Air Force.
e. Q series routing identifiers (RIDs) indicate Navy contractor inventory control
points (ICPs), while C series RIDs indicate Army contractor ICPs.


  5.2.50. Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR) Effects On ILS-S Requisitions.
      5.2.50.1. Purpose. To explain Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR) edits and
      the effects of MACR restrictions on ILS-S requisitions.
      5.2.50.2. Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR) Restrictions. The Funds
      Manager establishes a MACR for all budget code 9 and Z items within each system
      designator. The MACR allows the LRS/Materiel Management Activity management to
      monitor inventories within the GSD stock fund by controlling spending.
          5.2.50.2.1. MACR Factors. The MACR factor provides a means for automatic
          adjustment of the economic order quantity (EOQ) by allowing a separate factor to be
          loaded for each subgroup or stockage priority code (SPC). The MACR factor does
          not have any effect on requisitioning objectives. In fact, the MACR factor serves as a
          means to smooth the requisitioning process by extending the requirement over a
          longer period of time. This results in the generation of requisitions for smaller
          quantities at increased frequencies. The MACR factors allow the LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity management to determine the health of the GSD operating
          program. Additionally, MACR factors provide a short-term means to stabilize
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             451


         spending programs. See Ch 2 for more information concerning the use of MACR
         factors.
         5.2.50.2.2. Urgency of Need Funding Flag (UNFF). The urgency of need funding
         flag (UNFF) selectively restricts requisition processing by using UND. The ILS-S
         produces requisitions when customer issue requests contain a UND (position 1 of the
         UJC) equal to or smaller than the UNFF reflected in the MACR. For example,
         assigning UNFF “A” restricts requisitioning for all customer requests (except
         MICAP) containing UND A, B, or C. Note: UNFFs are assigned to the MACR by
         processing 1LM MACR adjustment transactions. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M and Ch 2
         for more information and format concerning MACR adjustment (1LM) transactions.

Table 5.58. Urgency of Need Funding Flag (UNFF).
    UNFF    UNFF Description
    A       Requisition Urgency of Need Designator (UND) A Only
    B       Requisition Urgency of Need Designator (UND) A and B Only
    C       Requisition all Urgency of Need Designator (UND) A, B, and C
    E       Do not Requisition. Produce Fund Requirement Card (FRC) for
            All Requirements
         5.2.50.2.3. Maximum Automatic Obligation (MAO). The MAO limits the maximum
         dollar amount of individual requisitions. Two MAO monetary fields are locally
         established by the Funds Manager to control requisitioning for stock replenishment
         and customer due-out requirements. The MAO values are always expressed in whole
         dollars and are adjusted by loading new dollar figures with a financial adjustment
         (MAC) transaction input. See Ch 2 for loading MAO values on the MACR. Note:
         The minimum value that may be loaded is $50.
         5.2.50.2.4. Total Obligations Authorized (TOA). The Total Obligations Authorized
         (TOA) on the MACR represents the total dollar value of requirements authorized to
         be requisitioned. The TOA value applies to due-out and stock replenishment
         requisitions.
      5.2.50.3. Effects of MACR Restrictions.           If customer or stock replenishment
      requirements pass established MACR edits, the ILS-S automatically produces requisition
      (A0*) transactions. For requirements that do not pass MACR edits, or when the
      requisition suppression flag is activated, a Fund Requirement (FRC) image is produced.
      See Para 5.2.51 for more information concerning the requisition suppression flag. See
      Para 5.2.53 for more information and processing instructions for FRC output images.
   5.2.51. Requisition Suppression Flag.
      5.2.51.1. Purpose. To explain the effects on retail materiel management requisitions
      when the Requisition Suppression Flag is activated.
      5.2.51.2. Requisition Suppression Flag Processing. The ILS-S will only produce a single
      A977 MGT notice for each processing day after the requisition suppression flag is
      activated. The A977 MGT notice will be produced for the first requisition that exceeds
      the Total Obligations Authorized (TOA) field on the MACR. Note:                MICAP
452                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      requirements and manual (offline) requisitions are the only exceptions. However, under
      the following conditions, requisitions will not be created, and additional management
      notices will be produced when the requisition suppression flag is activated.
         5.2.51.2.1. Actual Obligations Plus Actual Commitments.              The requisition
         suppression flag is activated when actual obligations plus actual commitments for all
         categories (WRM/Initial Spares/etc.) reach a specified or default percent of the Total
         Financial Authority (TFA). The requisition suppression flag is also activated when
         actual obligations for individual categories reach a specified or default percent of
         their individual planned obligations.
         5.2.51.2.2. Total Operating Obligations Plus Actual Commitments. The requisition
         suppression flag is activated when total operating obligations plus actual
         commitments reach a specified or default percent of planned operating obligations.
         5.2.51.2.3. Fund Requirement (FRC) Output Image.              Once the requisition
         suppression flag is activated, the ILS-S will produce Fund Requirement (FRC) output
         images until additional funds are loaded. During End-of-Day (EOD) processing, the
         requisition suppression flag and management notice indicators are cleared each day.
         If additional funds have not been loaded to the MACR, the first requisition produced
         the following day(s) the requisition suppression and management notice indicator is
         activated. This sequence continues until funds are loaded to the MACR. See AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for more information concerning the requisition suppression
         flag during EOD processing.
  5.2.52. Other Funds-Specific Requisition Restrictions.
      5.2.52.1. Purpose. To explain other funds-specific requisition restrictions used in the
      ILS-S for DLA and AFMC items.
      5.2.52.2. AFMC Funding Limitation. Requisitions may be restricted in the ILS-S based
      upon a combination of the source of supply, item cost, and base location. Bases may
      provide a statement to the item manager indicating limited base funds for requisitions.
      When a funds limitation statement is received from a base, the item manager should take
      this into consideration when procuring new items to satisfy requisitions. However,
      AFMC item managers are authorized to exceed $2500 per line item, plus 10 percent,
      without first getting the approval of the requisitioning activity.
      5.2.52.3. DLA Funding Limitation. DLA customer service centers accept and process
      Air Force retail Materiel Management Activity overseas requisitions with funding
      limitation statements for budget code 9 or Z, non-NSN items and those items containing
      acquisition advice code (AAC) F (fabricate or assemble) or L (local purchase). If an
      overseas (OCONUS) retail Materiel Management Activity sets a funding limitation for
      DLA item requisitions costing over $2,500, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will
      manually prepare an output requisition (A0*) document (DD 1348-1A) with document
      identifier code (DIC) A05/A0E.          Enter the statement “MAXIMUM FUNDS
      AUTHORIZED $XXXX.00” in the lower right-hand corner of the manually prepared
      requisition output. However, if the maximum funds cited on the DD 1348-1A are too
      low for the DLA item manager to procure the item, the requisition will be canceled.
      Note: Before submitting requisitions with funding limitation statements, the retail
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                453


     Materiel Management Activity should research historical demand records to find the
     former cost of the same or a substitute item. This action may prevent the requisition from
     being canceled unnecessarily.
  5.2.53. Fund Requirement (FRC) File and Image Processing.
     5.2.53.1. Purpose. The FRC image file consists of customer (due-outs) and stock
     replenishment requisitions that have been suppressed. Customer due-out FRC images
     consist of priority customer requirements containing an UND of A or B, and the most
     current customer routine requirements containing UND C. Stock replenishment FRC
     images are produced for stock replenishment restricted requisition requirements.
     Although GSD stock funds are generally available, retail materiel management activities
     are responsible to operate within an approved GSD operating program. Therefore, part of
     the total dollar value of the FRC image file represents pending orders, once requisitioned,
     may cause a financial burden to the operating program. For this reason, selective
     requisitioning of items may be performed. The FRC image file is maintained in stock
     number and system designator sequence by customer due-out and stock replenishment
     images.
        5.2.53.1.1. FRC Image Consolidation. When requisitioning resumes, AFMC SCM-R
        Stock Control Activity may consolidate customer due-out and stock replenishment
        FRC requirements to reduce the number of requisition (A0*) transactions. AFMC
        SCM-R Stock Control Activity should also consolidate customer due-out and stock
        replenishment FRC requirements for local purchase items whenever possible. Note:
        Air Force policy requires retail materiel management activities to consolidate
        requisitions to the GSA. This policy applies to both customer priority and routine
        due-out requirements containing UND B and C.
        5.2.53.1.2. FRC Consolidation for GSA. To create the single requisition, establish a
        firm due-out to set the releveling flag on the item record. The ILS-S will produce a
        single requisition during requirements computation or when the stock replenishment
        FRC is reinput. The UMMIPS priority will normally be based upon the Force
        Activity Designator (FAD) used for stock replenishment and the highest UND (B or
        C) due-out.
        5.2.53.1.3. FRC Image Reject Conditions. The ILS-S rejects any FRC input image
        for customer (due-out) requirements if a corresponding due-out detail cannot be
        located, the memo/firm due-out flag is zero (firm), or the FRC input image quantity is
        less than the due-out quantity. Note: To requisition less than the due-out quantity,
        process a special requisition (SPR) transaction for the required quantity. See Para
        5.2.54.5 for more information concerning SPR transaction processing.
     5.2.53.2. FRC Image for Memo Customer Due-Out Requirements. The ILS-S produces
     a separate FRC image for each memo customer due-out containing UNDs A and B.
     Note: FRC images are consolidated into a single requisition for memo customer due-out
     requirements that contain ERRCD XB* and a UND C. The ILS-S File Status or R04
     program will generate FRC images with a T in position 51 for UND C requirements
     under these conditions.
454                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.53.3. FRC Output for Stock Replenishment Requirements. The ILS-S File Status or
      R04 program will generate FRC images for stock replenishment requirements.
      5.2.53.4. Transaction Exception Code (TEX) Effect on FRC Processing. The TEX code
      assigned to FRC images will affect ILS-S processing as follows:
         5.2.53.4.1. TEX Code Blank. Under normal conditions, the ILS-S produces a
         requisition (A0*) transaction for the quantity requested if the FRC image does not
         contain a TEX code, and the routing identifier code (RIC) is not GSA. If the RIC
         equals GSA, the ILS-S will produce a requisition (A0*) transaction for the quantity
         requested (stock replenishment) plus the total quantity required for customer due-outs
         containing UND B or C.
         5.2.53.4.2. TEX Code T - Relevel and Requisition for UND B and C Due-Outs .The
         ILS-S will produce a requisition (A0*) transaction for FRC images containing TEX T
         for the quantity required to fill UND B and C customer due-outs. However, the
         output requisition quantity may exceed the FRC image input quantity if the RIC is
         GSA and there are other memo (unrequisitioned) UND B and C due-outs.
         Additionally, if a Quantity Unit Pack (QUP) is involved, the output requisition
         quantity will be adjusted to the next unit pack. See Para 5.2.39 for more QUP
         information and processing instructions.
         5.2.53.4.3. TEX Code S – Relevel and Requisition Entire Stock Replenishment
         Quantity. The ILS-S will produce a requisition (A0*) transaction for FRC images
         containing TEX S for the entire quantity required for stock replenishment. Note:
         UND C due-out requirements are also included in the requisition quantity.
         5.2.53.4.4. TEX Code R – Do Not Relevel and Requisition FRC Quantity for Stock
         Replenishment. The ILS-S will produce a requisition (A0*) transaction for FRC
         images containing TEX R for the requisition input quantity required for stock.
         However, if a QUP applies, the input quantity is adjusted to the next unit pack. Note:
         Processing FRC images with TEX R prevents the ILS-S from recomputing
         requirements for these items. Therefore, excess due-in details may be established.
         5.2.53.4.5. TEX Code 7 – Do Not Requisition. The ILS-S will not produce a
         requisition (A0*) transaction for FRC images containing TEX 7. When due-out FRC
         consolidation is desired, Stock Control enters TEX code 7 in the FRC due-out
         images. Subsequently, the system will change the due-out memo/firm flag to zero
         (firm), and not produce a requisition.
      5.2.53.5. FRC Input for Customer Due-Outs (Supplies). The ILS-S will produce a
      requisition (A0*) transaction for the due-out quantity contained on FRC input images for
      due-out document numbers that do not contain a TEX code.
         5.2.53.5.1. If the FRC input image quantity is less than the due-out detail quantity,
         the ILS-S creates a 266 Reject. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more
         information.
         5.2.53.5.2. If the FRC input image quantity is greater than the due-out detail quantity

AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  455


           requisition (A0*) transaction for the due-out detail quantity, adjusted to the next
           quantity unit pack, if applicable.
           5.2.53.5.3. If the FRC input image quantity is greater than the due-out detail quantity
           and the TAC equals E (equipment), the ILS-S creates a 350 management notice. See
           AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
           5.2.53.5.4. If the FRC input image contains a blank advice code and a QUP applies,
           the ILS-S adjusts the requisition (A0*) transaction quantity to the next quantity unit
           pack. See Para 5.2.39 for more information.
           5.2.53.5.5. FRC Input for Customer Due-Outs (Equipment). The ILS-S blanks the
           TEX code from the due-out detail if the FRC input image applies to budget code 9
           equipment due-outs and the RIC is not JBR, J**, or D**. Note: The ILS-S creates
           an I028 MGT notice during FRC creation if a serviceable balance is found. If
           serviceable on-hand balances are to be bypassed, use the procedures for Special
           Requisition (SPR) transaction processing. Conversely, the ILS-S will perform
           releveling on items containing FRC input images for equipment due-outs containing a
           TEX code other than blank. If the output requisitioned quantity will create an excess
           condition, the ILS-S rejects the FRC input image.
        5.2.53.6. FRC Input for Stock Replenishment. Input of FRC input images for stock
        replenishment that do not contain a TEX code will cause the ILS-S to automatically
        recompute requirements. The ILS-S will produce a requisition (A0*) transaction for the
        input quantity or the new quantity required for stock (whichever is smaller), plus all
        memo UND B due-outs. Note: For FRC requirements identified as potential problem
        items, the ILS-S enters an asterisk (*) in the TEX Code field (position 51) of the stock
        replenishment FRC.
        5.2.53.7. FRC Image Format. See Table 5.59 for format and processing instructions for

  5.2.54. Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction.
      5.2.54.1. Purpose. This describes the application and procedures for processing Special
      Requisition (SPR) transactions. The SPR transaction is used to create due-in details for
      requisitions when the ILS-S is inoperative, and/or requisition items the ILS-S does not
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                459


     automatically requisition, and/or requisition items requiring special processing
     procedures.
     5.2.54.2. Assignment of Automated Requisition Data. The ILS-S will automatically
     assign the document identifier code (DIC), routing identifier code (RIC), media and
     status (M&S) code, and demand code (if not entered), and produce requisition (A0*)
     transactions when SPR transactions are processed. See Para 5.2.37 for output requisition
     (A0*) transaction format and data elements. Additionally, the ILS-S will assign an
     automated (inline) requisition number when the document number (position 30-43) field
     on the SPR transaction is left blank. The ILS-S will process the SPR transaction, create a
     due-in detail, and produce an output requisition (A0*) transaction with the following
     automated data assigned:
        5.2.54.2.1. Document Identifier Code (DIC). The ILS-S will assign the appropriate
        DIC based upon the type of stock number requisitioned and base location.
        5.2.54.2.2. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). The ILS-S will apply the SPR transaction
        input RIC (if entered) on output requisition (A0*) transactions. However, if the SPR
        transaction input RIC is left blank, and no requisition override data applies, the ILS-S
        will apply the RIC from the item record on the output requisition. If the RIC field is
        left blank on SPR transactions for local purchase and local manufacture items that
        cannot be obtained locally (REX 2), the ILS-S will assign the RIC to the output
        requisition based upon the Federal Supply Classification (FSC) of the item.
        5.2.54.2.3. Media and Status (M&S) Code. For SPR input transactions, the ILS-S
        will assign the appropriate M&S code to the output requisition (A0*) transaction
        based upon the requisition priority designator. See Para 5.2.38 for more information
        concerning M&S code assignment. See Para 5.2.43 for more information concerning
        requisition priority designator assignment. Note: Position 7 of the SPR input
        transaction may be used to assign a Special Requirement Indicator (SRI) to the
        requisition as required. However, if the SPR input transaction does not contain a SRI,
        and if the document number and mark-for fields are both blank on input, the ILS-S
        will perform requirements computation on the SPR transaction input stock number.
        If the input quantity exceeds the computed requirement, the ILS-S will produce a 305
        Reject (QTY REQD PLUS O/H AND ON ORDER EXCEEDS AUTH). See Ch 5 for
        more information concerning special requirement indicator processing.
        5.2.54.2.4. Document Number. If the SPR transaction input requisition document
        number (position 30-43) is left blank, the ILS-S will assign an automated (inline)
        requisition document number. See Para 5.2.41 for more information concerning
        assignment of automated requisition document numbers.
        5.2.54.2.5. Demand Code. If the SPR transaction input demand code (position 44) is
        left blank, the ILS-S will assign demand code R (recurring). See Para 5.2.42 for
        more information and a list of applicable requisition demand codes.
        5.2.54.2.6. Other Automated Requisition Data. If the SPR transaction input
        supplementary address (except satellite accounts) (position 45-50), project code
        (position 57-59), required delivery date (except for MICAP and lateral requisitions)
        (position 62-64), and advice code (position 65-66) are left blank, the ILS-S will
460                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         assign data for these fields (if applicable) from internal records on the output
         requisition (A0*) transaction. Otherwise, data entered on the SPR input transaction in
         these fields will be applied.
      5.2.54.3. Degraded Operations Requisitioning Procedures. If the ILS-S is inoperative
      (Degraded Operations), AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will submit requisitions
      as authorized by established Degraded Operations procedures. See Ch 2 for more
      information. Note: During Degraded Operations, Air Force retail materiel management
      activities may request (requisition) items from supply sources by telephone under certain
      situations. Special requisition (SPR) transactions are then used to create associated due-
      in details for Degraded Operations requisitions telephoned into the source of supply.
         5.2.54.3.1. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity Processing of Degraded
         Operations Requisitions. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will use the
         following instructions to process special requisitions for Degraded Operations
         requirements when required.
         5.2.54.3.2. Prepare the Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction. During Degraded
         Operations, the SPR transaction input format is used as described in Table 5.61.
         Note: For Degraded Operations (offline) requisitions submitted for inter-Service
         support (Army/Navy/Marines), the materiel management aggregation code (MMAC)
         field (position 21-22) will be blank.
         5.2.54.3.3. Assign the Requisition Document Number. For the requisition document
         number during Degraded Operations, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must
         assign a manual (offline) document number in position 30-43. See Para 5.2.41 for
         more information concerning requisition document number assignment.
      5.2.54.4. Manual (Offline) Requisition Requirements. The ILS-S will not requisition or
      produce requisition (A0*) transactions for all types of requirements. Therefore, AFMC
      SCM-R Stock Control Activity must prepare and process SPR transactions to requisition
      the following types of items:
         5.2.54.4.1. Items Assigned Stockage Priority Code (SPC) 5 or E. See Ch 2 for more
         information concerning SPC assignment.
         5.2.54.4.2. Items Assigned a Local Unit of Issue (-1 Stock Number). See AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning the assignment of -1 stock
         numbers. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning for more
         information concerning requisitioning -1 stock numbers.
         5.2.54.4.3. Items Assigned REX Codes. Items assigned REX Codes 1, 3, and 4 (do
         not requisition), or other REX codes assigned exception notice code R (Reject).
         5.2.54.4.4. AFMC-Managed Items Purchased Locally. See Para 5.2.38 2 for more
         information concerning requisitioning AFMC-managed items locally.
         5.2.54.4.5. Lateral Support Items. Lateral support items, unless a REX override has
         been loaded to generate automatic requisitioning from the lateral support base. See
         Para 5.2.38 for more information concerning lateral support requisitioning.

  Notes:
  1. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). If the SPR is for a lateral support requirement from
  a non-GSD Stock Fund activity, then use routing identifier JLS. If the SPR is for a
  lateral support requirement from a GSD Stock Fund (ILS-S) activity, use the
  appropriate D(**) routing identifier code. If item record contains REX code 2 and the
  source of supply is JB*, leave this field blank.
  2. Special Requirements Indicator (SRI). If the SPR is for a special requirement that
  exceeds the requisitioning objective, enter Special Requirements Indicator R in
  position 7. When the Special Requirements Indicator is used, positions 67-80 must be

  blank. If the SPR is for upgrading a memo due-out to MICAP, enter 1 in position 7,
  the MICAP UJC in positions 52-53, and the due-out document number in positions 67-
  80. If the SPR is for a minimum buy requirement previously canceled, take the
  following actions:
  a. Prepare and process a SPR transaction with an offline document number and SRI R
  in position 7.
  b. Prepare a manual requisition (A0*) transaction with the same SPR offline document
  number and send to the source of supply.
  c. Process a due-in/due-out update (DIT) transaction to link the due-in and due-out.
  d. Capture and destroy the requisition modifier (AM*) transaction created by the ILS-
  S.
  3. Stock Number, Unit of Issue, Quantity, and System Designator. The Stock Number
  must match the Stock Number of the Due Out when the Due Out Document Number is
  entered on the SPR input (pos. 67-80). When the Input Stock Number does not match
  the corresponding Stock Number of the Due Out, a 354 Reject is created. If the
  document number is blank, the ILS-S assigns the requisition number (inline) and
  creates the requisition (A0*). These are the only fields required when the ILS-S
  prepares the requisition for stock replenishment.
  4. Document Number. If applicable, enter the 14-character offline requisition number
  assigned for the special requisition. If positions 4-6 are left blank for SOS JB* and
  REX 2, the document number must be blank or a 352 REJ notice (Input Routing
  Identifier or Vendor Code Blank or in Error) will occur. When an off-line requisition
  number is entered for a requisition processed to any RID beginning with F (i.e., F**) or
  DLJ, a CHA/CH1 transaction will be automatically generated and sent to DLATS. The
  format for the CHA/CH1 is described in Table 5.62.

  5. Demand Code. Enter the appropriate demand code. If positions 67-70 contain
  ISSL/MSSL/NASSL, this entry must contain demand code N only.
  6. Supplementary Address. If the input routing identifier code is JLS (lateral support),
  the supplementary address field cannot be blank. Enter the SRAN from the base
  supplying the item.
  7. Signal Code/Fiscal Year Code/Command Unique Cause Code/Fund Code/Urgency
  Justification Code. For these multipurpose fields, the following information applies:
  a. If the SPR is for Base Funded Investment Equipment (budget code Z), enter the
  fiscal year code of the appropriation symbol (third character of symbol) which is to
  finance the requisition in position 51.
  b. If the SPR is for Base Funded Investment Equipment (budget code Z), enter the
  fund code of the funded appropriation financing the purchase in positions 52-53. For
  example, use fund code 17 for appropriation 57*3080, fund code 29 for 57*3600, or
  fund code 8C for 97*0300.4802 (NIMA only). If appropriation is 57*3080 (budget
  code Z) and involves Air National Guard (ANG) investment funds, use fund code XP.
  c. If the SPR is for Base Funded Investment Equipment (budget code Z) for Industrial
  Fund activities, enter the appropriate fiscal year code in position 51, the fund code in
  positions 52-53, and requisition advice code 2E in positions 65-66.
  d. If the SPR is for a MICAP requirement and the item record contains REX Z
  (Command Repair Facility), it must contain command-unique cause codes 1-6 in
  position 51.
  e. If the SPR is for stock replenishment, these fields will be blank unless Fund Code
  30/58 is used.
  f. If the SPR is for a WRM requirement required for a deployed unit, enter UJC 1T
  (MRSP) or 1Z (HPMSK) in positions 52-53 and the due-out document number of the
  appropriate MRSP/HPMSK detail in position 67-80.
  g. If the SPR is for all other requisitions, these fields may be left blank.
  8. Hour Code. If the SPR is manually done and contains a due-out document number
  in positions 67-80 for a MICAP condition, enter the correct hour code in this field. See
  Para. 5.2.26. for a list of MICAP hour code.
  9. Project Code. If the SPR is for emergency local purchase of an item normally
  managed by DLA, enter the S** routing identifier code (RIC) in positions 57-59. If the
  SPR is for WRM due-out requirements, positions 57-59 should contain the appropriate
  project code.
  10. Priority Designator. If the SPR is marked for a due-out (positions 67-80) and the
  SPR transaction contains a blank document number, positions 60-61 may be blank.
  The ILS-S will compute and assign the requisition priority based on a combination of
  the customer FAD and UJC.
  a. If positions 60-61 contain 01-10, positions 67-80 must contain a due-out document
  number or a 292 REJ notice (Invalid Priority) will occur. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2
464                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


 Ch 7 for more information.
 b. If the SPR is manually done, an offline document number is assigned in positions
 30-43, and positions 60-61 contain 01-10, and positions 67-80 do not contain a due-out
 document number, enter a pseudo due-out document number in positions 67-80 to
 establish the due-in detail.
 11. Required Delivery Date (RDD). Enter RDD as required in positions 62-64.
 12. Advice Code. If the SPR is for AFEMS L and P number equipment brochure
 items obtained laterally, enter advice code 2E in positions 65-66. If appropriation is
 57*3080 (budget code Z) and involves Air National Guard (ANG) investment funds,
 enter advice code 2E in positions 65-66.
 13. Due-Out Document Number. When the SPR applies to ISSL/MSSL/NASSL
 adjusted stock levels, positions 67-70 must contain ISSL, MSSL, or NSSL, and
 positions 71-78 must contain a corresponding serial number. If the SPR is for a
 customer due-out, enter the due-out document number in positions 67-80. This action
 will assign the requisition priority and link the due-in and due-out details.
 14. Data from the corresponding fields on the requisition image.


  5.2.55. Special Requirements Indicator (SRI) R.
      5.2.55.1. ILS-S SRI R Processing.
      5.2.55.2. Purpose. The ILS-S will place SRI R on the due-in detail. Additionally, the
      system will add the SRI R requisition quantity to the Requisitioning Objective (RO)
      when the requisition quantity is computed. Note: SRI R requisition quantities are not
      considered by the ILS-S when excess due-in quantities are computed. See Ch 2 for more
      information on due-in excess computation.
  5.2.56. Lateral Support Requisitioning Procedures.
      5.2.56.1. Purpose. To explain the procedures used by retail materiel management
      activities to requisition items from other Air Force bases through lateral support to satisfy
      requirements. Both automated (inline) and manual (offline) procedures for submitting
      and processing lateral support requisitions by retail materiel management activities are
      discussed. The Automatic Lateral Support (sourcing) feature of ES-S is also addressed.
         5.2.56.1.1. Support of D-BRITE Program Only. D-BRITE requisitions for CONUS
         bases will first be sourced from the source of supply (FGZ). Lateral support will only
         be used once confirmed delay status is received from the Federal Aviation
         Administration (G69). The D035A system does not have visibility of available assets
         at G69, so do not consider a zero balance at FGZ as delayed status. You should
         contact the IM for the current status.
      5.2.56.2. Automated Lateral Requisitions.       Mission requirements may require
      requisitions (A0x) to be submitted from one retail materiel management account to
      another. To support automated lateral requisitioning, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
      Activity personnel assign a supporting requisition override record and requisition
      exception code (REX) to each applicable item record. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 465


     8 and Ch 5 for more information concerning creation and management of requisition
     override records.
        5.2.56.2.1. Requisition Override Record. The requisition override record must
        contain the D** lateral support base routing identifier code (RIC). If a satellite
        account is shipping the item, the requisition override record must contain the RIC of
        the satellite's host computer support base (CSB), and the system designator of the
        satellite. Additionally, to automate lateral support requisitions, the requisition
        override record will contain the following data:
           5.2.56.2.1.1. Lateral requisition flag. Assign a lateral requisition flag of one (1).
           5.2.56.2.1.2. Requisition advice code. Assign the requisition advice code to
           identify one of the following options for the lateral support retail Materiel
           Management Activity:
               5.2.56.2.1.2.1. Fill or pass option. To process the requisition as fill or pass,
               leave the advice code blank. If the requisition cannot be filled, it is passed to
               the source of supply indicated by the routing identifier code (RIC) in positions
               78-80. No lateral due-in detail is established at the lateral support base.
               5.2.56.2.1.2.2. Fill or kill option. To process the requisition as fill or kill,
               assign advice code 2C. Advice code 2C advises the lateral support base to fill
               the requisition quantity if possible and cancel the portion of the requisition
               quantity that cannot be filled. See Para 5.2.31 for more information
               concerning requisition advice code 2C.
               5.2.56.2.1.2.3. Fill or backorder option. To process the requisition as fill or
               backorder, normally assign requisition advice code 6X. If the requisition is
               for an economic order quantity (EOQ) item and the cumulative recurring
               demands (CRDs) at the lateral support base are to be updated, assign
               requisition advice code 6Y. Note: When the fill or backorder option is used,
               the lateral support ILS-S will ship assets to zero balance. See Para 5.2.31 for
               more information concerning 6X and 6Y requisition advice codes.
        5.2.56.2.2. Lateral Requisition (A0*) Output Format. When the lateral requisition
        flag on the requisition override record is set to one, the lateral requisition (A0*)
        transaction is produced with the following data:
           5.2.56.2.2.1. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). Positions 4-6 equals the D(**)
           lateral support base routing identifier code (RIC) contained on the requisition
           override record. Positions 73-75 will contain the RIC of the requisitioner, and
           positions 78-80 will contain the RIC of the source of supply.
           5.2.56.2.2.2. Force Activity Designator (FAD), Urgency Justification Code
           (UJC). If the lateral requisition is for a customer due-out, positions 62-64 will
           contain the requesting organization's force activity designator (FAD) and issue
           request urgency justification code (UJC). Note: The ILS-S due-in detail will
           contain the RIC assigned to the item record.
466                                                   AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.56.2.3. Due-In Detail and Funding Records. Due-in details will be established at
      the base that originates the lateral requisition. Funding records will be established
      based upon the item record routing identifier code and budget code assigned.
      5.2.56.2.4. Processing Lateral Requisitions at the Lateral Support Base. When the
      lateral support base receives requisition (A0*) transactions, they are directly input
      into the ILS-S. Note: The system will accept and process lateral support requisition
      (A0*) transactions against the input system designator only. The ILS-S at the lateral
      support base releases and ships available assets to fill lateral requisition requirements
      based upon the priority designator.
      5.2.56.2.5. Lateral Support Requisition Supply Status. The ILS-S at the lateral
      support base provides supply status (AE*) transactions for the requisition (A0*).
      Shipment status (AS*) is provided for each item physically shipped. Note: If the fill
      or pass option is used and the lateral requisition is passed to the source of supply, the
      lateral support base will not provide supply status. Normal MILSTRIP supply and
      shipment status transactions apply. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
      Requisitioning for more information on supply status (AE*) processing, and Para
      5.2.88 for a list of the different MILSTRIP supply status codes. The following
      paragraphs describe the different types of status that may be received from the lateral
      support base. The type of status received is based upon the requisition signal and
      advice codes.
         5.2.56.2.5.1. Signal Code D or M.
             5.2.56.2.5.1.1. Fill or pass (requisition advice code equals blank). The ILS-S
             assigns supply status code BA (release for shipment) for the quantity
             available. For the unfilled quantity, the ILS-S will pass the requisition to the
             routing identifier code (RIC) in positions 78-80 of the input. BM (passing)
             status will be provided to the requisitioner.
             5.2.56.2.5.1.2. Fill or kill (requisition advice code equals 2C). The system
             provides BA status for the quantity available and CB (not filled) status for the
             quantity killed.
             5.2.56.2.5.1.3. Fill or backorder (requisition advice code equals 6X or 6Y).
             The system provides BA status for the quantity available, and BD (delayed)
             status for the quantity not available.
         5.2.56.2.5.2. AMC Forward Supply System (FSS) WRM Lateral Requisitions.
         When an AMC FSS lateral requisition quantity cannot be totally filled because of
         a shipment (SHP) transaction constraint, the ILS-S produces a supply status
         (AE(x)) transaction containing status code “BQ.” The ILS-S will not allow
         multiple shipments for the same requisition document number. When BQ status
         is received, the requisitioner must submit a new lateral requisition with a new
         document number for the cancelled quantity.
      5.2.56.2.6. I023 MGT notice. Under certain conditions, the ILS-S will produce an
      I023 MGT notice upon input of a lateral support requisition (A0*) transaction at the
      lateral support base. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for more information and the
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 467


        output format of the I023 MGT notice. The following paragraphs detail the
        circumstances when the I023 will be produced.
           5.2.56.2.6.1. Firm DIFM/Supply Point Balances Exist (requisition advice code
           equals blank). If the lateral support requisition (A0*) transaction input requisition
           advice code is blank (fill or pass) and a firm due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM) or
           Supply Point balance exists, the ILS-S will generate an I023 MGT notice when
           there are not enough items to completely satisfy the lateral support requisition
           quantity. The lateral support base must determine, based upon the requisition
           priority, if the remaining quantity on the lateral support requisition should be
           satisfied from DIFM or Supply Point assets, or passed to the source of supply for
           action.
           5.2.56.2.6.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Balances Exits (requisition advice
           code equals 6X, 6Y, or 2C). If the lateral support requisition (A0*) transaction
           input advice code is 6X/6Y (fill or backorder) or 2C (fill or kill), and WRM
           balances exist at the lateral support base, the ILS-S will generate an I023
           management notice. Note: The I023 MGT notice is generated because WRM
           assets may only be released by management.
           5.2.56.2.6.3. Processing I023 management notices.              Use the following
           instructions to process the I023 MGT notice.
               5.2.56.2.6.3.1. Fill requisition from DIFM and/or supply point balances. If
               AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity at the lateral support base chooses to
               fill the request with the available items from either DIFM and/or Supply Point
               balances, reinput the lateral support requisition (A0*) transaction using
               requisition advice code 6X or 6Y as appropriate.
               5.2.56.2.6.3.2. Pass requisition. The lateral support base uses this option only
               after deciding not to use available items to fill the request. To use the pass
               requisition option, the lateral support base reinputs the original lateral support
               requisition (A0*) transaction with an “X” in position 54. Note: The first line
               of print from the I023 MGT notice is used for the A0* transaction format.
               The X in position 54 prevents the ILS-S from generating another I023 MGT
               notice and provides appropriate supply status (BN) to the requisitioner.
               5.2.56.2.6.3.3. Kill requisition. If the lateral support base decides to kill (do
               not fill) the lateral support requisition, the lateral support requisition (A0*)
               transaction is reinput with requisition advice code 2C. Advice code 2C
               generates CB status for the requisitioning base. See Para 5.2.87 for more
               information concerning CB status.
        5.2.56.2.7. Lateral Requisition Shipment Edits. After the lateral support base ILS-S
        has determined items are available for shipment, additional internal checks are
        performed to determine if the items may be shipped. If these checks are passed, the
        requested items are released for shipment by changing the input lateral requisition
        (A0*) transaction to an input lateral redistribution order (A2*).
           5.2.56.2.7.1. Shipment Exception Code (SEX). If the requested item at the lateral
           support base is available, and does not have a SEX assigned, the item will be
 468                                                          AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


                  shipped. If position 76 of the lateral requisition (A0*) transaction contains the
                  item SEX code, this indicates that lateral support requisition has previously
                  rejected and an I023 MGT notice was produced. Therefore, the lateral support
                  ILS-S considers this condition as management approval for the lateral shipment
                  and will continue processing the shipment.
                  5.2.56.2.7.2. Exception Notice Code (ENC). If the exception notice code on the
                  shipment exception phrase record located at the lateral support ILS-S is R
                  (Reject), the system will generate a 289 Reject. If the ENC at the lateral support
                  retail Materiel Management Activity is P (process), the items will be shipped as
                  directed in the shipment override record. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
                  more information and corrective actions concerning 289 REJ notices.
         5.2.56.3. High Priority Lateral Support Definition. Lateral support is authorized for
         Mission Capable (MICAP) requirements, Awaiting Parts (AWP), and JCS project-coded
         needs. Authorized lateral support requests shall be filled from Peacetime Operating
         Stock (POS), Readiness Spares Package (RSP), or Forward Supply Location (FSL) assets
         as detailed in Table 5.64.
              5.2.56.3.1. High priority lateral support policy. In general, lateral support (donor)
              bases shall honor high priority lateral support requests when the priority of the
              requisition need (requestor) is greater than the priority of the resulting replenishment
              requisition based on the Spares Priority Release Sequence (SPRS). The SPRS is
              reflected in Table 5.63 below.

Table 5.63. Spares Priority Release Sequence (SPRS).
       Priority                                  Explanation
          01        Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project coded MICAP requirement –
                    Requisition contains an “N” or “999” in the Required Delivery Date
                    (RDD) field and a “9-series” project code (i.e., 9FS).
         01         Project code 700 MICAP requirement - Requisition contains an “N”
                    or “999” in the Required Delivery Date (RDD) field and a “700”
                    project code.

      5.2.56.4. Automatic Lateral Support (Sourcing). ES-S includes an Automatic Lateral
      Support features designed to support MICAP, AWP, JCS project coded, and Forward
      Supply Location (FSL) project coded requirements. ES-S’s Automatic Sourcing feature
      uses complex sourcing rules (based on the rules above) and near-real time asset and
      requirements data from source systems (ILS-S, SCS, and EBS) to automatically
      determine the best enterprise source for fulfillment of requisitions. Once the best source
      is determined the system will create the appropriate legacy system transactions to initiate
      the movement of the asset(s) from the selected source. The automatic sourcing capability
      is flexible enough to suspend/start automatic sourcing as needed (e.g., for a specific stock
      number, base, etc.). A detailed description of this feature is available in Ch 12 of the ES-
      S User’s Manual.
  5.2.57. Part Number Requisitioning Procedures.
      5.2.57.1. Purpose. This paragraph explains requisitioning procedures for part-numbered
      item requisitions generated by the ILS-S. Document identification codes, item record
      coding, and supporting documentation requirements are described for each source of
      supply when applicable. The ILS-S has Part Number Requisition capability. This allows
      users to submit selected (exception) part number requisitions and associated descriptive
      data to DLA in a single transaction. This capability is designed to eliminate the need to
      manually send a DD 1348-6 (or equivalent) to DLA. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 4 Ch 6
      for Part Number (Exception) Requisitions and ES-S user’s Manual, Ch 20.
      5.2.57.2. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. The Commercial and
      Government Entity (CAGE) code identifies individual manufacturing activities for part-
      numbered items. Specific CAGE codes are defined in Federal Cataloging Handbooks
      H4-1 and H4-2. When a CAGE code cannot be determined, use ZZZZZ.
      5.2.57.3. User/End Item Application. The User/End Item Application field identifies the
      Technical Order (TO) number, drawing number, specification number, end item, or any
      other reference data to assist the source of supply to identify, procure, and/or manufacture
      the correct part-numbered item.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              471


     5.2.57.4. DLA and GSA Part Number Requisitions. The DLA and GSA will normally
     not accept part numbered or non-cataloged item requisitions from CONUS Air Force
     bases. Special document identifier, item record coding, and supporting documentation
     are required to process these types of requisitions as follows:
        5.2.57.4.1. Document Identifier Code (DIC) A0E/A05. Document identifier A0E
        (CONUS) and A05 (OCONUS) requisition transactions are produced for all GSA and
        DLA part number requisitions. Additionally, A0E and A05 transactions are used on
        all other sources of supply part number requisitions if the part number exceeds ten
        digits (P-serialized), or the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) equals
        ZZZZZ. Note: Either of these circumstances dictate additional information must be
        provided to the source of supply to assist in the identification, procurement, and/or
        manufacturer for the requisitioned item.
        5.2.57.4.2. General DLA/GSA Part Number Requisition Processing. For both
        CONUS and OCONUS DLA/GSA part number requisitions, AFMC SCM-R Weapon
        System Support Activity (for MICAPs) and LRS/Materiel Management Activity (for
        non-MICAPs) will re-format the part number item requisition (A0E/A05) output by
        entering the required data in the MILSTRIP portion of the DD 1348-6 (non-NSN
        requisition). Leave positions 8-22 (NSN) blank and enter the entire CAGE code and
        part number (except for the federal supply code (FSC)) in Block One of the
        identification data on the DD 1348-6. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more
        information concerning DD 1348-6. After you have completed the DD 1348-6, mail
        the requisition transaction and the DD 1348-6 to the source of supply using
        MILSTRIP part number requisitioning procedures. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for
        more information.
        5.2.57.4.3. GSA Part Number Requisitioning Policy for Overseas Bases. If the
        source of supply is the GSA, overseas bases should process the requisition using
        MILSTRIP part number requisitioning procedures, with the following exceptions:
        MILSTRIP part number/non-NSN message requisitions will be sent to HQ
        CASC/CCH, 74 N. Washington Ave., Battle Creek, MI. 49017-3094. The
        Cataloging and Standardization Center (CASC) will perform the necessary part
        number research required in order for GSA to process the requisition. CASC will
        return abbreviated MILSTRIP message supply status. A status message containing
        delayed (BD) status will be provided to the requisitioning base with an estimated
        release date (ERD) 30 days greater than the requisition date. This message should be
        used as the source to update ILS-S status with an AE* status input transactions. It is
        important these inputs are processed in a timely manner in order to delay automated
        follow-up (AF*) transactions to GSA. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
        Requisitioning for more information concerning requisition status (AE*) and
        requisition follow-up (AF*) transaction processing.
        5.2.57.4.4. DLA Part Number Requisitions Containing Document Identifier Code
        (DIC) A0B/A02. Assign DIC A0B (CONUS) or A02 (OCONUS) to requisition
        (A0*) transactions if DLA is the source of supply, the manufacturer’s part number is
        ten digits or less, and the CAGE code is not ZZZZZ. LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity (except for MICAPs) will reformat the requisition by placing the
472                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         manufacturer’s CAGE code in positions 8 through 12 and the part number in
         positions 13 through 23 of the output requisition (A0B/A02) transaction.
      5.2.57.5. HQ AFMC Part Number Items. Process AFMC part number requisitions as
      follows:
         5.2.57.5.1. Document Identifier Code (DIC) A0B/A02. Assign DIC A0B (CONUS)
         or A02 (OCONUS) on HQ AFMC part number requisition (A0*) transactions if the
         CAGE code is not ZZZZZ, the manufacturer's part number is ten digits or less, and
         the technical order (TO) identification number is loaded in the nomenclature field on
         the ILS-S item record. For example, TO reference TO 1C-130E-507 would be
         assigned to the nomenclature field. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more
         information concerning the establishment of ILS-S part number records.
         5.2.57.5.2. Document Identifier Code (DIC) A0E/A05. Assign DIC A0E (CONUS)
         or A05 (OCONUS) if the manufacturer's part number is more than ten digits long, the
         CAGE equals ZZZZZ, or the technical order (TO) identification number is not loaded
         to the nomenclature on the item record. In these situation, follow the instructions
         above for DLA/GSA part number requisitions using document identifier code A0E
         and A05.
      5.2.57.6. DLATS Edits. For requisitions sent to Air Force sources other than
      F(*)Z/FPD/FPK, enter requisition advice code 2A (no local source) on the requisition
      (A0*) transaction. Note: Ensure the RIC for the source of supply is correct before
      entering requisition advice code 2A.
  5.2.58. Property Eligible For Exchange.
      5.2.58.1. Purpose. To list categories of property the Air Force may exchange with
      commercial sources to fill a requisition. Specific items may be exchanged only if both
      the item to be acquired and the item to be replaced are in the same numbered category.
      The Air Force may also exchange other categories of property, but only if Para. 5.2.59
      does not specifically prohibit the exchange. Additionally, both items must be designed
      and constructed for the same purpose.

  5.2.60. AL/2LM Item Requisition Processing.
      5.2.60.1. Purpose. To provide rules and metrics used for AL and 2LM requisition
      processing.
      5.2.60.2. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Project Codes. JCS assigned project coded
      requisitions and MICAP requisitions take first and second priority processing
      respectively. In fact, ILS-S processing of the priority will not be downgraded, though it
      can be upgraded. Additionally, ILS-S processing of the Required Delivery Date (RDD)
      will not be downgraded, though it can be upgraded. Lastly, requisition and shipment
      (REX/SEX) exception coding and overrides can upgrade the normal processing priority
      and/or RDD.
      5.2.60.3. Other Project Code Applies. If during normal automated (inline) ILS-S
      requisitioning, a specific project code is assigned other than those listed below, the ILS-S
      will not replace the existing project code to the below-listed project codes. Note:
      Manual processing of Due-in/Due-out modifier (DIT) transactions may be used to change
      automated assignment of project codes if desired. See Para 5.2.71 for more information.

       5.2.60.4. Minimum Requisition Requirements. The priority designator (PRI), project
       code (PC), and required delivery date (RDD) listed below are the MINIMUM
       requirements for AL/2LM requisitions. All of the below assets will be moved by express
       carrier. See Para 5.2.43 for more information concerning priority and RDD
       combinations used in the ILS-S.

   5.2.61. Joint Chiefs Of Staff (JCS) Project Flag and JCS/Intra-Air Force Project Code
   Load, Change, And Delete (CPF) Transaction.
       5.2.61.1. Purpose. To describe the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Project Flag and
       JCS/Intra-Air Force Project Code load, change, and delete (CPF) transaction.
       5.2.61.2. Input Restrictions. None.
       5.2.61.3. Output. I006 MGT notice. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more
       information.
       5.2.61.4. Input Format and Entry Requirements. Use CPF transactions to load, change,
       or delete JCS Project Flags and JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes assigned to item
       records. Note: You must assign both a JCS Project Flag and JCS/Intra-Air Force
       project code to the item record with the CPF transaction or a reject will occur. If the
       stock number is part of an ISG, the ILS-S will programmatically assign the JCS Project
       Flag and JCS/Intra-Air Force project code to all Master (M) and Interchangeable (I)
       coded stock numbers within the group. However, if the stock number is a bachelor item
       or substitute (S) coded item, the ILS-S will assign the JCS Project Flag and JCS/Intra-Air
       Force project code to the item record of the input stock number only.

Note:
Use an asterisk (*) in position 21 to delete the JCS Project Flag and Code on the item

Item Record.
  5.2.62. Customer Due-Out-Release (DOR).
      5.2.62.1. Purpose. To explain automatic and forced (manual) customer due-out release
      processing.
      5.2.62.2. Automatic Customer Due-Out Release Process. The ILS-S automatically
      releases serviceable assets to established customer backorders (due-outs) when receipt,
      turn-in, stock number merge/change, ISG add/change, condition/identity change, or
      inventory adjustment actions increase the item record serviceable balance. Automatic
      due-out release processing continues until all available serviceable assets are depleted or
      no other customer backorders exist. Available assets include all serviceable assets on the
      item record or compatible item records within the interchangeable and substitute group
      (ISG). Note: Customer backorders containing TEX 1, 8, H, U, X, or period (.) do not
      automatically release available assets to customers. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for
      TEX definitions and processing instructions.
      5.2.62.3. Manual Prevention of Automatic Due-Out Release. If management desires, the
      following transaction exception (TEX) codes may be used to prevent automatic due-out
      release of assets to satisfy customer backorders.
          5.2.62.3.1. TEX Code by Transaction Processing Effects. If the backorder release
          (DOR) transaction contains TEX 3 or 6, or the receipt (REC) transaction TEX equals
          2, 6, or Y, or the turn-in (TIN) transaction contains TEX B, D, 2, or 4, automatic due-
          out release is prevented. Note: If a local purchase (routing identifier JB(*)) item is
          received and the DOR transaction contains TEX 3, the linked customer backorder is
          released first. Any additional assets will release to any other customer backorder
          requirements second.
          5.2.62.3.2. TEX Code T. If the customer backorder contains TEX T, and the stock
          number backordered is different from the received stock number, automatic due-out
          release is prevented.
      5.2.62.4. Sequence of Due-Out Release. The sequence of release is based upon the force
      activity designator (FAD), urgency justification code (UJC), project code, type of
      requirement, (TEX code 0 due-outs), and document number date. See Para 5.2.65 for
      ILS-S asset sequence of release methodology. Exception: AMC Offshore Customer
      Backorders. AMC offshore customer backorders are released in a unique sequence after
      all other UND B due-outs. Normal sequence of release (as described above) does not

      apply. See Para 5.2.15 and Para 5.2.16 for document flow and distribution instructions
      for the DD Form 1348-1A, due-out release (DOR) output document.
      5.2.62.5. Forced (Manual) Due Out Release of Serviceable Assets. Serviceable assets
      can be manually (forced) released to a specific customer backorder by processing of any
      of the following transactions:
         5.2.62.5.1. Due-out release transaction containing TEX 3 in position 51, and the due-
         out document number in positions 30-43.
         5.2.62.5.2. Turn-in transaction containing TEX B, D, 2, 4 in position 51, and the due-
         out document number in positions 67-80. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 6B, Returns for
         more information and transaction format.
         5.2.62.5.3. Receipt transaction containing TEX 2, 6, or Y in position 51, and the due-
         out document number in positions 60-73.
      5.2.62.6. Optional Force DOR Method. Enter TEX 8 in position 51 of the receipt (REC)
      or turn-in (TIN) transaction and process through the ILS-S. Enter the terminal function
      number in positions 52-53 of the input transaction to direct the DD Form 1348-1A,
      output DOR document, to a specific terminal. Exceptions are as follows:
         5.2.62.6.1. Automatic Release. With automatic release, only the specific due-out
         being forced released prints at the terminal indicated in positions 52-53. Any other
         release documents are printed at the appropriate warehouse terminal function.
         5.2.62.6.2. Satellite Terminals. Due-out release transactions for satellite system
         designators, input at the host base, may only indicate the receiving terminal of the
         satellite function in positions 52-53 of the input transaction. The ILS-S ignores all
         other function numbers.
         5.2.62.6.3. Output Document. Process the output DD Form 1348-1A due-out release
         (DOR) output document as specified in Para 5.2.16
      5.2.62.7. Due-Out Release of Substitute Assets. Upon receipt of a suitable item
      substitute, the ILS-S automatically releases customer due-outs against the stock number
      received if possible. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning
      suitable item substitutes.
         5.2.62.7.1. One-Way Interchangeable Flag.        When the item record one-way
         interchangeable flag is a Y, the ILS-S edits the ISG source code. Assets will only
         due-out release automatically when the 101-ISG-SOURCE code on the received item
         is equal to or greater than the 101-ISG-SOURCE code on the requested item.
         5.2.62.7.2. Different Units of Issue. When the substitute item unit of issue is
         different than the unit of issue for the requested item, the ILS-S automatically
         converts (if possible) the requested item due-out quantity and releases the property
         issued. All remaining customer due-outs for the stock number received, the stock
         number requested, and master and interchangeable items will also release. Note:
         This process does not apply to due-out activity code S, W, M, U, or F, and those due-
         outs containing TEX T. When a substitute item is being forced released for a due-out
         with a different unit of issue and the unit of issue cannot be converted, the ILS-S
         produces an I032 MGT notice (Due-out DTL Unit of Issue Cannot be Converted for
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   479


          Auto DOR). The I032 MGT notice displays the due-out document number that could
          not be released in positions 30-43 of line 2. Additionally, all due-out details for the
          received item and ISG are printed. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more
          information and processing instructions for the I032 management notice.
   5.2.63. Forced Due-Out Release (DOR) Input Transaction.
       5.2.63.1. Purpose. To explain the processing procedures and transaction format for a
       forced due-out release (DOR) transaction.
       5.2.63.2. Input Restrictions. None.

 a. If you wish to release a specific due-out, enter the document number in positions 30-43
 and TEX 3 in position 51.
 b. If the input TEX equals blank, due-outs release automatically per the order of release
 table depicted in Para 5.2.65.
 4. The following information applies:
 a. To direct the DOR output document to a specific terminal, enter the terminal function
 number.
 b. Leave this field blank to not direct the output document to a specific terminal. The DOR
 output document will be directed to the applicable warehouse terminal if the item record
 contains a warehouse location. If no warehouse location exists, the DOR output document is
 directed to the input terminal.
 5. If the DOR input is manual (TEX 6) and the UND is 1, /, or J (MICAP), enter the last
 three positions of the Julian date in positions 57-59 and the one-position hour code in
 position 60. See Para 5.2.26 for a list of applicable MICAP hour codes. Additionally, enter
 either MICAP delete code in position 61. See Para 5.2.26 for a list of applicable MICAP
 deletion codes.
 6. If the DOR input is manual (TEX 6/Y), enter the last three positions of the Julian date in
 pos. 57-59. This date is the due-out release date.
 7. Not a required entry when the DOR transaction is processed from a LRS/Materiel
 Management Activity terminal. It is programmatically assigned by IMDS CDB when a
 DOR is processed from an IMDS CDB terminal.

 unserviceable detail document number in positions 60-73.
   5.2.64. Due-Out Release Processes For Special Type Items.
       5.2.64.1. Purpose.    To explain due-out release processes for special items or
       circumstances.
       5.2.64.2. Release of Special Type Items. Table 5.68 identifies ILS-S issue procedures
       for special type items described in this paragraph.

     5.2.64.3. Degraded Operations Due-Out Release. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2E,
     Degraded Operations for manual due-out release procedures.
     5.2.64.4. Repair Cycle and Expendable Item Due-Out Release.
        5.2.64.4.1. Repair Cycle Items. When a repair cycle item (ERRCD XD/XF) due-out
        release is processed in the ILS-S, DIFM control remains under the stock number
        originally requested. If a repair cycle item is received for an activity code D
        (SPRAM) customer backorder, use the procedures stated in AFMAN 23-122, Sec.
        5G, SPRAM. The ILS-S will increase the applicable SPRAM detail record on-hand
        quantity field. If a substitute item is received for a SPRAM backorder, the ILS-S will
        build a substitute detail record. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5G, SPRAM for more
        information.
        5.2.64.4.2. Expendable Items. EOQ (ERRCD XB3) items will not automatically
        due-out release for repair cycle item (ERRCD XD(*)/XF(*)) backorders. If such a
        release is attempted, a 100 Reject is produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7
        for more information concerning 100 rejects. If an EOQ item is subsequently
        received for a repair cycle item customer backorder, cancel the repair cycle due-out
        and process a customer issue request for the EOQ item using the appropriate demand
        code.
     5.2.64.5. Recapped Tire Due-Out Release. Recapped tires are not released automatically
     by the ILS-S. During turn-in or receipt processing of a recap tire an I028 (Select D/O To
     Be Force Release) printed listing all customer backorder requirements. If the recap tire
     can satisfy any of the due-outs, prepare and process a manual (forced) DOR transaction
     using TEX 3 in position 51 (Para 5.2.63). Note: A supply point detail record must be
     loaded in the ILS-S for the master stock number with type authorization T or a 260 Reject
     will be produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for more information concerning type
     authorization codes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information
     concerning 260 rejects.
     5.2.64.6. Stockage Priority Code (SPC) E Item Due-Out Release. Customer backorders
     for equipment items that contain stockage priority code (SPC) E are not automatically
     released. When a receipt or turn-in transaction is processed, the ILS-S produces an I028
     MGT notice listing all associated backorders. Any existing customer backorders may be
     force due-out released using TEX 3 as specified in Para 5.2.63 See AFMAN 23-122,
     Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure for more information concerning assignment of SPC E.
     5.2.64.7. MRSP/IRSP Item Due-Out Release.
        5.2.64.7.1. Supportable Assets.   Release of supportable assets increases the
        MRSP/IRSP detail on hand or deployed quantities as appropriate, as well as the 025-
        SUP-UNITS-ON-HAND. The MRSP/IRSP backorders release just ahead of urgency
        of need designator (UND) C requirements in the ILS-S release order and within 025-
        MRSP-IRSP priority designator.
        5.2.64.7.2. Unsupportable Assets. Unsupportable item backorders are established
        with TEX U. When an unsupportable asset is received, a supportable due-out for the
        quantity received is built by the ILS-S and inserted into the release order. The TEX
        U (unsupportable) due-out is simultaneously deleted, or in the case of a partial
482                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         receipt, decremented. The new due-out (supportable) reflects an identical document
         number. However, the ILS-S-assigned next available serial number (date portion) is
         different. When the unsupportable quantity on the detail record equals zero, the
         supportability code is blanked. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2I, Provisioning for more
         information concerning supportable and unsupportable WRM items.
             5.2.64.7.2.1. The force due-out release (DOR) is permitted for TEX U due-out
             detail records only.
             5.2.64.7.2.2. A TEX 2 receipt is allowed to provide the capability to release only
             the linked TEX U or a non-TEX U higher priority due-out. This can be
             accomplished by inserting the due-out document number in positions 60-73 of the
             TEX 2 receipt.
         5.2.64.7.3. Release of Least Acceptable Flagged MRSP/IRSP Items. When an
         MRSP/IRSP detail record contains a least acceptable flag (in FILLER-1 field) other
         than blank, a substitute item will not be released to satisfy due-outs against that detail
         unless the 101-ISG-SOURCE code on the receipted item is equal to or greater that the
         least acceptable flag on the MRSP/IRSP detail.
      5.2.64.8. Off-Base Supply Point Item (TEX Z) Due-Out Release. When an off-base
      supply point customer issue request is processed, and the type authorization on the supply
      point detail equals D, the use of TEX Z will result in the following:
         5.2.64.8.1. Establishes a Linked Due-In. The due-out release program interfaces
         with the requisitioning programs to establish a linked due-in. Because the supply
         point due-out contains a linked due-in established with TEX Z, the asset will not be
         released until the asset for the linked due-in is received.
         5.2.64.8.2. Direct Shipment to Remote Supply Points.        This procedure
         accommodates direct shipment to remote supply points by providing the 218-
         DIRECT-SHIP-SRAN to the requisitioning process for automatic insertion in the
         due-in at the time the due-out is established.
      5.2.64.9. Local Purchase (Budget Code 9) Item Due-Out Release.
         5.2.64.9.1. Budget code 9 local purchase customer backorders will be released and
         the customer charged, according to the following criteria:
             5.2.64.9.1.1. Linked Local Purchase Due-Outs. The receipted item due-in detail
             record will release to its linked due-out detail record before releasing to any other
             requirements.
             5.2.64.9.1.2. Customer Charges. When the due-in received is linked to a specific
             due-out detail record, the customer will be charged the unit price from the 205
             detail record (due-out). When the due-in received is not linked to a specific due-
             out detail record, the customer will be charged the unit price from the 202 detail
             record (due-in). Note: When a due-out release is caused by other than the
             normal receipt of an item due-in, the customer will be charged the unit price from
             the 101 record (item record).
      5.2.64.10. Unserviceable Materiel from DLADS Due-Out Release. Due-out release
      should occur automatically from receipt processing, unless a reject condition exists.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              483


      After correcting any reject condition, process a manual DOR transaction with the due-out
      document number in positions 30-43, TEX 3 in position 51, and the unserviceable
      document number in positions 60-73. See Para 5.2.63 for the manual (forced) DOR
      transaction format and processing instructions.
   5.2.65. ILS-S Order Of Release Sequence Table.
      5.2.65.1. Purpose. To describe the sequence of release for due-out release (DOR)
      transaction processing. The ILS-S materiel release sequence is designed to ensure the
      most urgent customer backorder is filled when serviceable assets become available. The
      type customer backorder table in Para 5.2.21 provides a description of each type
      backorder.

  5.2.70. Requisition Modifications.
      5.2.70.1. Requisition Modifier Input (DIT) Transaction. The due-in/due-out update
      (DIT) transaction is used to change various data elements on ILS-S due-in details. See
      Para 5.2.71 for information concerning eligible data elements, and the format for
      requisition modifier input (DIT) transaction.
      5.2.70.2. Requisition Modifier Output (AM*) Transaction. AFMC SCM-R Stock
      Control Activity uses the DIT transaction to modify requisition data and produce
      requisition modifier (AM*) transactions to inform retail and wholesale sources of supply
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                489


     of base requirement changes. See Para 5.2.73 for the output requisition modifier (AM*)
     transaction format, and processing instructions related to data element changes.
        5.2.70.2.1. Automated requisition modifier (AM*) output transaction. Normally, the
        requisition modifier document is automatically produced by the ILS-S when
        significant changes occur to established requisitions. See Para 5.2.71 for processing
        instructions using the due-in /due-out update program. Subsequent AM* transactions
        are automatically produced when any change to the priority designator and/or
        required delivery date (RDD) occurs due to unplanned or unforeseen national or local
        emergencies. When the emergency no longer exists, requisition priorities will be
        downgraded as applicable and the RDD extended. Additionally, automated AM*
        transactions are produced when there is any change to the due-in detail supplementary
        address or requisition advice code. Lastly, automated AM* transactions are prepared
        when any change to the due-out detail FAD or UJC that forces a priority designator
        change on the due-in detail. See Para 5.2.73 for AM* transaction processing
        instructions.
        5.2.70.2.2. Manual requisition modifier (AM*) output transaction. Due-in/due-out
        (DIT) update programs automatically produce AM* transactions that contain the
        routing identifier code (RIC) from the due-in detail. However, when the last known
        source of supply is not equal to the due-in detail RIC, AFMC-R Stock Control
        Activity must manually prepare and process a requisition modifier output (AM*)
        transaction. See Para 5.2.73 for the AM* transaction format. See Para 5.2.74 for
        additional information concerning processing requisition modifier (AM*) transactions
        in the ILS-S.
     5.2.70.3. Modification of Lateral Support Requisitions. When a lateral requisition due-in
     is updated, an (AM* transaction is produced by the requisitioning base and sent to the
     lateral support base. At the lateral support base, the AM* transaction is input to the ILS-
     S. Next, the system internally converts the AM* modifier transaction to a DIT
     transaction. During the DIT transaction processing, the system checks for a matching
     lateral requisition shipment suspense detail. If a matching shipment suspense detail with
     Transportation Control Number (TCN) type shipment data is found, the ILS-S produces a
     shipment status (AS1) transaction for the requisitioning base. If a shipment suspense
     detail is found but lacks transportation data, a MILSTRIP status (AE1) transaction with
     BA status is produced for the requisitioning base. Note: ILS-S programs that process
     AM* transactions use the input routing identifier to find the lateral support shipment
     suspense detail regardless of the input system designator. If the shipment suspense detail
     is not found, a MILSTRIP status (AE*) transaction is produced with status code BF (no
     record) and sent to the requisitioning base. See Para 5.2.88 for more information
     concerning BF status.
     5.2.70.4. Source of Supply Action on Requisition Modifier (AM*) Transactions. The
     source of supply will modify requisitions in the wholesale supply system after receiving
     AM* modifier transactions. However, the source of supply will only modify the
     requisition provided the requested change(s) are authorized. Any unauthorized changes
     will be ignored. If an AM* transaction is received and the requisition number is not on
     file in the wholesale supply system, the modifier (AM*) transaction is treated in the same
 490                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        manner as a requisition reinstatement (AT*) transaction. Ultimately, the wholesale
        supply activity will reinstate the requisition as a result of this process.
   5.2.71. Due-In/Due-Out Modifier (DIT) Input Transaction.
        5.2.71.1. Purpose. The Due-in/Due-out modifier (DIT) transaction is used to modify
        multiple fields on ILS-S due-in and due-out details.
        5.2.71.2. Requisition Data Eligible for Modification. DIT transactions can be used to
        change any or all of the following requisition (due-in detail) data: project code; priority
        designator; required delivery date; special requirements indicator; linked due-out
        document number; requisition advice code; and the supplementary address. (Use the
        NOR E transaction to update the delivery destination, supp address, advice code, project
        code, FAD for MICAP due-ins). Note: DITs are authorized to be processed for Memo
        MICAP due-outs.
           5.2.71.2.1. Customer Request Data Eligible for Modification. DIT transactions can
           be used to change any or all of the following customer request (due-out detail) data:
           transaction exception code; authority for issue flag; force activity designator;
           supplementary address; due-in detail document number; urgency justification code;
           and the mark-for.
           5.2.71.2.2. DIT Transaction Rejects and Management Notices. If the DIT transaction
           is processed through the RPS, then only reject messages will be output. If the input is
           processed through a remote terminal, reject messages or I006 MGT will be printed
           and output at the input terminal.
           5.2.71.2.3. ILS-S Processing of Requisition Modifiers. See Para 5.2.74 for the
           effects, processing procedures, and requisition modifier (AM*) transactions
           produced, for the different types of requisition data that may be changed by DIT
           transaction processing.
        5.2.71.3. Input Restrictions. None.
        5.2.71.4. Output. See I006 MGT notice in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 .

Notes:
1. If no change is required, leave this field blank.
2. If the DIT input or due-in detail does not contain a due-out document number,
this field will be ignored.
3. Transaction Exception Code (TEX). If the due-out is for an equipment item
(budget code 9), the base is not under 100 percent due-out obligation, and the due-
out is memo only, transaction exception code (TEX) 8 may be added or deleted
from a due-out detail. Enter asterisk (*) in this column to remove TEX code 8 from
the due-out detail. If a change is desired to an awaiting parts (AWP) due-out detail,
use the TEX code compatibility tables in Para. 5.2.72. Enter TEX code E to
bypass the end item document number edit.
4. If the DIT input or due-out detail does not contain a requisition number, the
ILS-S will ignore this field.
5. To blank the corresponding field of the applicable detail, enter an asterisk (*) in
the first position of this field. Fields cannot be blanked under the following
conditions:
a. If the due-in detail is not for an unsupportable Mobility Readiness Spares
Package (MRSP) or In-Place Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) item, and the due-
in source of supply is AFMC, the RDD cannot be blanked.
b. If the due-out has been obligated, the due-in requisition number on the due-out
detail cannot be blanked.

c. If the type organization code is 7, 8, 9, A, B, G, I, or V, and the activity code is
not S, M, U, or W, the mark-for field of due-out cannot be blanked.
d. If the signal code on the due-in detail is other than A, C, or D, then the due-in
supplementary address will not be blanked.
6. Project Code. The due-out detail will be designated with a TEX O if the
following conditions apply: 1) the input project code is 9** (Joint Chiefs of
Staff/Office of the Secretary of Defense requirement), and 2) the current due-out
TEX code is not a 1, 8, H, U, or X. If the due-in project code is deleted or changed
from a 9** project code, the TEX code O will be blanked. The NOR E transaction
will be used to update the project code for MICAP due-ins.
7. Authority for Issue (AI) Flag. Activity code P on customer requests (position
30) designates non-Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID). To update
the Authority for Issue (AI) flag on an activity code P equipment due-out, enter the
new AI flag in this field. See Para. 5.2.6. for more information concerning AI
flags.
8. Supplementary Address (Due-In Detail). This field is used only to update the
supplementary address on the due-in detail. If you blank the supplementary
address, make sure the signal code is A, C, or D.
9. When changing the equipment ID on due-outs, enter the new equipment ID in
positions 67-73.
10. Supplementary Address (Due-Out Detail). If a change is desired and the due-
out detail is for an activity assigned type organization code A or B (Civil Engineer),
this field must contain a valid Civil Engineer work order number. If a change is
desired and the due-out detail is for a Vehicle Maintenance organization, this field
must contain a valid Vehicle Maintenance work order number and change code.
11. Enter a valid due-out document number (positions 44-57) to change a memo
due-out. If positions 36-43 contain a requisition number, the due-out document
number will be stored in the due-in detail, the requisition number will be stored in
the due-out detail, and the due-in priority will be modified to correspond to the due-
out detail UJC and the FAD.
12. Urgency Justification Code (UJC) and Required Delivery Date (RDD).
a. If the due-out detail contains a Mission Capability (MICAP) UJC, which is
designated by a first position 1, J, or / (excluding 1T and 1Z), changes to the detail
mark-for, UJC, or due-in fields must be made with a TRIC NOR.
b. If the due-out is to be upgraded to MICAP, process a TRIC NOR input.
c. If the UJC is being changed to 1T or 1Z, the detail must be for a deployed
MRSP (deployed flag or MRSP detail flag is turned on).
d. If the current UJC is 1T, the UJC may be changed regardless of the state of the
flags.
13. Priority Designator (positions 60-61). If the DIT input or due-in detail
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                493


contains a due-out document number, this field must be blank and priority changes
must be made to the due-out detail UJC and/or (FAD). The ILS-S will convert
these to a requisition priority. If the DIT input and due-in detail do not contain a
due-out document number, this field must contain priority 11-15, 99, or blanks. If
a requisition override applies, this field may contain any priority that is equal to or
greater than the override priority.
14. Exception Data Code. If exception data are required on the output requisition
modifier (AM*), enter an E in this field. If no output requisition modifier is
desired, enter an X. Any other entry in this field will be ignored.
15. Mark-For Data (positions 67-80). If a change is desired to mark-for data, enter
the new data in positions 67-80 in the same configuration. If the SRD and work
unit code is changed on a due-out, this data will also be automatically changed on
corresponding DIFM details.
16. System Designator. Enter the system designator of the due-in or due-out detail
being updated.
17. System Designator. Enter the system designator of the DIFM detail when the
system designators of the due-out detail and corresponding DIFM detail are
different.
18. Enter Y in position 81 to bypass the edit for the end item document number.
Only authorized for use after receipt of a 260 reject and the AWP end item is no
longer loaded.
  5.2.72. Awaiting Parts (AWP) UJC/TEX/Mark-For Decision Table.
      5.2.72.1. Purpose. To show the affect DIT processing has on awaiting parts (AWP) due-
      out detail urgency justification code (UJC), transaction exception code (TEX), and the
      mark-for data fields.
      5.2.72.2. How to Read Table 5.74 The first action is to find the Current Detail Data
      rows which correspond to the actual detail to be changed. Within these rows, find the
      one row which has the Desired Detail Data values that correspond to what the due-out is
      to be changed to. The DIT Input Data for that row will show what DIT input will change
      the Current Detail Data to the Desired Detail Data. For example, the first row shows how
      to change a detail with a UJC of AR, a blank TEX code, and DIFM document number
      mark-for into a detail with a UJC of AR, a blank TEX code, and a new DIFM document
      number. Simply enter the DIT input of a blank UJC, a TEX code of 5, and the new
      DIFM document number.
      5.2.72.3. Reporting Changes to AWP Due-In and Due-Out Details. When the DIT input
      is processed (thus changing an existing due-out from a non-AWP UJC to AWP UJC AR
      or BR), a B9(*) AWP “Start” report transaction will be produced. When changing an
      existing due-out from AWP UJC AR or BR to a non-AWP UJC, a B9(*) AWP “Stop”
      reporting transaction will be produced. Note: If the DIT input contains both a due-out
      document number and a requisition number, the due-in and due-out details will be linked.
      To unlink due-in and due-out details, process a DIT input with an asterisk (*) in position
 494                                                 AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       36 or 67. This will also change the due-out detail to memo. See Ch 4 for more
       information concerning AWP reporting transactions.

   5.2.73. Requisition Modifier (AM*) Output Transaction.
        5.2.73.1. Purpose. To notify DoD or Air Force sources of supply of changes to the
        priority and/or required delivery date fields on existing ILS-S requisitions. The
        requisition modifier transaction is sent to any authorized supply source when changes
        require expedited processing.
        5.2.73.2. Priority Designator. If DIT processing results in the upgrade of a customer
        due-out detail UJC, the ILS-S will automatically upgrade the related requisition (due-in)
        detail using the FAD and UND.
        5.2.73.3. Required Delivery Date (RDD). To change the RDD in previously submitted
        requisitions.
        5.2.73.4. Mass Requisition Cancellations. To identify requisitions for items still required
        to support Base Closures. Modifier (AM*) transactions for these requisitions will be
        submitted at the earliest possible date and contain RDD 555 (Expedited Handling Signal).
        5.2.73.5. Output Destination. RPS/main system.
        5.2.73.6. Input. The requisition modifier (AM*) output transaction is only used as an
        input transaction when lateral support requisitions apply. The AM* transaction input
        format is the same as the AM* transaction output format in this situation. See Para
        5.2.74 for more information concerning modification of lateral support requisitions.
        5.2.73.7. Output Format. See Table 5.75

Notes:
1. Document Identifier Code. AME/AM5 modifier transactions will be mailed. See
Para. 5.2.74. for the different requisition modifier (AM*) transaction identifiers.
2. Required Delivery Date (If Applicable). This field will contain RDD 555 to
identify those requisitions considered already in processing due to Base Closure action.
See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5D, Equipment Management and Sec. 9C, Air Force
Donation, Loan and Lease Programs and DLM 4000.25-1-M for more information
about requisitions that require special processing during mass cancellation and Base
Closure actions.
  5.2.74. Effects Of Processing Requisition Modifier (DIT) Transactions.
      5.2.74.1. Purpose. To explain the effects of processing due-in/due-out (DIT) change
      transactions. Additionally, this section explains the processing of subsequent requisition
      modifier (AM*) transactions.
      5.2.74.2. DIT Transaction Processing Effects. Internally, the ILS-S produces changes to
      due-in or due-out details.
          5.2.74.2.1. Due-In and No Associated Due-Out. If the DIT input is to change a due-
          in detail which has no corresponding due-out, the input must contain a requisition
          number in positions 36-43. The due-in detail will be changed to the data in the DIT
          input.
          5.2.74.2.2. Due-In and Associated Due-Out. If DIT processing changes a due-in or
          due-out detail, the ILS-S will automatically update the corresponding due-out or due-
          in. For example, if the due-out Urgency Justification Code (UJC) is changed, the
          corresponding due-in priority designator will be updated as well.
          5.2.74.2.3. General Changes to Linked/Unlinked Due-Ins and Due-Outs. To link
          due-in and due-out details together, the DIT input must contain both a due-in and
          due-out document numbers. Conversely, to unlink due-in and due-out details, the
          DIT input will contain an asterisk (*) in position 36 (De-link Due-in) or 67 (De-link
          Due-out). Note: Processing DIT transactions to de-link due-in and due-out details
          will change the due-out detail to memo. When the DIT input is processed (changing
          an existing due-out from a non-AWP UJC to UJC AR or BR), a B9(*) AWP reporting
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                499


         start transaction will be produced. When changing an existing due-out from UJC AR
         or BR to a non-AWP UJC, a B9(*) AWP reporting stop transaction will be produced.
         See Para 5.2.72 for a table that explains DIT processing effects for AWP due-out
         details.
         5.2.74.2.4. Priority Changes to Due-In Details. If DIT transaction processing links
         due-in and due-out details, the ILS-S may also change the requisition priority to
         correspond with the due-out detail. When due-in and due-out details are linked, the
         ILS-S will automatically use the due-out detail UND and FAD to compute a new
         requisition priority. Therefore, the possibility exists that DIT processing may change
         the due-in priority, even though no change was made to the due-out detail UND or
         FAD.
     5.2.74.3. Additional DIT Processing Effects. The DIT transaction will write a change-to
     and a change-from transaction history for priority 1-10 requisitions which have at least
     one of the following fields changed after DIT processing: due-in project code; due-in
     priority; due-out document number; required delivery date; UJC; or FAD. Note: The
     DIT transaction will automatically update the due-in detail Date of Last Transaction
     (DOLT), but it will not change the due-out detail or item record DOLT. Additionally, if
     the due-out detail does not have a linked due-in detail, the ILS-S will fill the due-in
     quantity field with a nine (9) in each position.
         5.2.74.3.1. Requisition Priority Upgrade. If DIT processing results in the upgrade of
         a due-out detail UND, it will also automatically upgrade the related item record
         Stockage Priority Code (SPC), if applicable. Note: DIT processing will never result
         in the downgrading of an item record SPC. See Ch 2 for more information
         concerning SPC assignment.
         5.2.74.3.2. Requisition Priority Downgrade. If a due-in detail exists without a
         corresponding (linked) due-out detail, the ILS-S will automatically downgrade the
         requisition priority as required. If the item is an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
         item, the requisition will be downgraded to priority 11 through 15. Repair cycle
         (ERRCD XD*/XF*) items with six (6) or more demands, zero (0) Percent of Base
         Repair (PBR), and no on-hand assets will be downgraded to priority 09. All other
         repair cycle due-in details will be downgraded to priority 11 through 15.
     5.2.74.4. Updating Lateral Support Details. When a lateral requisition due-in detail is
     modified, an AM* modifier transaction is output and sent to the lateral base. At the
     lateral base, the AM* transaction is input and the ILS-S internally changes the AM* to a
     DIT transaction input. DIT processing checks for a matching lateral requisition due-out
     or a shipment suspense detail. If a matching lateral requisition due-out is found, the ILS-
     S compares the due-out data to the DIT input for possible changes. If a matching
     shipment suspense detail is found containing shipment data, the ILS-S produces a
     shipment status (AS1) transaction. If the shipment suspense detail exists without
     shipment data, a status (AE*) transaction with BA status is produced. The transactions
     are then sent back to the requisitioning base.
  5.2.75. Requisition Modifier (AM*) Transaction.
 500                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       5.2.75.1. Requisition modifier (AM*) transactions are used to increase or decrease
       priority designators, and change required delivery dates in previously submitted
       requisitions.
       5.2.75.2. Requisition Quantity Change. Do not submit requisition modifier (AM*)
       transactions to change requisition quantities. The correct course of action for this
       condition is to request due-in cancellation (AC1), process cancellation status (AE*) on
       the existing requisition, and submit a new requisition for a new quantity and document
       number.
       5.2.75.3. Automated Preparation of Modifier (AM*) Transactions. Normally, the
       requisition modifier (AM*) transaction is automatically produced by the ILS-S by the
       due-in/due-out (DIT) update program when any change to the priority designator and/or
       RDD occurs. Note: The requisition modifier (AM*) transaction is also used to notify
       the wholesale supply system of any changes to the supplementary address and/or advice
       code.
       5.2.75.4. Manual Preparation of Modifier (AM*) Transactions. ILS-S due-in detail
       update programs automatically produce requisition modifier (AM*) transactions
       containing the due-in detail Routing Identifier Code (RIC). However, when the last
       known source of supply is not equal to the due-in detail RIC due to passing (BL/BM)
       status, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activities must manually prepare and transmit a
       requisition modifier (AM*) transaction to the new RIC. See Para 5.2.73 for the AM*
       modifier transaction format and instructions. In general, the AM* transaction is manually
       prepared using applicable information from the original requisition. AFMC SCM-R
       Stock Control Activities will change the document identifier code, routing identifier
       code, priority designator, and/or required delivery date (RDD) as required. The
       requisition modifier (AM*) transaction is always sent to the last known source of supply.
       Lastly, a DIT transaction may be processed with an X in position 65 when a requisition
       modifier (AM*) transaction is not required. See Para 5.2.71 for DIT transaction format
       and processing instructions.
       5.2.75.5. Requisition Modifier (AM*) Transaction Document Identifier Code (DIC).
       Table 5.76 identifies appropriate modifier transaction DIC for CONUS and OCONUS
       retail Materiel Management Activity locations.

     5.2.75.6. Source of Supply Processing. After the source of supply receives requisition
     modifier (AM*) transactions, the wholesale supply system modifies the requisition as
     necessary provided the requested changes are authorized. Unauthorized changes will be
     ignored. If a requisition modifier (AM*) transaction is received by the wholesale supply
     system, but the complete 14-position requisition number is not on file, the requisition
     modifier transaction will be treated the same as requisition reinstatement (AT*)
     transactions.
  5.2.76. MICAP Notification/Status (NOR) Transaction.
     5.2.76.1. Purpose. To explain the processing and usage of the MICAP notification/status
     (NOR) transaction. The NOR transaction is used to initiate MICAP report (B9M)
     transactions for MICAP incidents, changes, cannibalization actions, transfers, and make
     internal corrections that are not processed automatically by the ILS-S. The NOR
     transaction is used to upgrade, downgrade, or change applicable MICAP due-in or due-
     out detail records in the ILS-S. Note:       When NOR transactions are successfully
     processed, ILS-S transaction history records are created and stored. Only the NOR
     Transaction should be used to modify MICAP requisitions and/or due-outs.
     5.2.76.2. MICAP Action Date and Time. The MICAP action date and time elements are
     required on MICAP notification (NOR) input transactions and output MICAP report
     (B9M) transactions as described in Para 5.2.30 The MICAP action date is the actual
     date and time that base maintenance determined a MICAP condition occurred--not the
     date and time the MICAP transactions or reports were prepared and processed by the
     Mission Support section. For example, if an item was cannibalized from an aircraft on
     Saturday morning at 0200, and the cannibalization (NOR) transaction was not processed
     until the following Monday, the correct action date would be Saturday, and the action
     time would be 0200 or hour code C. Another example concerns MICAP delete code 9
     cancellations. If a corrected MICAP report is to be resubmitted, the action date and time
     should be the date and time of the original MICAP occurrence--not when the MICAP
     cancellation was processed. This will ensure that erroneous MICAP hours are backed out
     of D165B.

        5.2.77.1.1. Purpose.    To explain ILS-S automated (inline) follow-up processing
        procedures.
        5.2.77.2. ILS-S Eligible Records. The following ILS-S details are checked by the
        automated (inline) follow-up program and contain follow-up schedules listed in this
        section. Note: ILS-S due-in details containing Project Code 175 are excluded from
        automated follow-up processing. Note:       Project Code 175 requires MAJCOM
        authorization. MAJCOMs will provide follow-up criteria for these due-in details.
           5.2.77.2.1. Due-In Details.
           5.2.77.2.2. Shipment Status Details. The automated follow-up program will create
           follow-up transactions for shipment status details that are overdue based on Military
           Standard Transportation and Movement Priority (MILSTAMP) standards.
        5.2.77.3. The Automated (Inline) Follow-up Program. The automated (inline) follow-up
        program should be processed daily to ensure there is equitable distribution of follow-up
        (AF*) transactions for wholesale sources of supply and items requisitioned through Base
        Contracting. The follow-up program logic provides follow-up action on due-in, excess,
        shipment suspense, shipped-not-credited, unserviceable Due-In-From-Maintenance
        (DIFM), and DIFM details that exceed the age criteria.
           5.2.77.3.1. Excess Report Detail Follow-up. See Ch 2 for more information.
           5.2.77.3.2. Shipped-Not-Credited (SNC) Detail Follow-up. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
           Pt 3, Ch 8 for more information.
           5.2.77.3.3. Shipment Suspense (SSC) Detail Follow-up. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
           3, Ch 8 for more information.
           5.2.77.3.4. Unserviceable (R920RW) Detail Follow-up. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
           3, Ch 8 for more information.

           23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 8 for more information.
        5.2.77.4. Follow-up Transaction Document Identifier Code (DIC).                Follow-up
        transactions for due-in details that do not contain status are created depending upon the
        Media and Status (M&S) code and priority designator assigned. Initial and subsequent
        follow-up transactions for due-in details without status will contain document identifier
        code AT* as depicted in Table 5.87

        5.2.77.4.1. Follow-up for Service-Managed Due-In Details Without Status.
        Automated follow-up processing schedules depend upon the source of supply,
        requisition priority, and whether or not any status is recorded. This section concerns
        follow-ups for due-in details without supply status for AFMC, DLA, GSA, other
        Service-managed items, and items requisitioned from lateral (D**) series routing
        identifier codes. Due-in details without status are categorized in the ILS-S as
        described in the following paragraphs. Note:          Processing schedules for ILS-S
        follow-up for due-in details without status will be based upon the type of supply
        status and priority designator.
           5.2.77.4.1.1. 100 Percent Status Required. Media and status (M&S) codes that
           designate 100 percent status is required are B, C, D, E, F, G, S, T, U, V, W, and
           X. See Para 5.2.38 for more information concerning M&S coding on ILS-S
           requisitions. If 100 percent status is required, automated follow-up transactions
           will be created by the ILS-S as follows:
               5.2.77.4.1.1.1. Requisition Priorities 01-08. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 4 days after the date the requisition was created.
               5.2.77.4.1.1.2. Requisition Priorities 09-15. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 8 days after the date the requisition was created.
           5.2.77.4.1.2. Exception Status. Media and status (M&S) codes that specify
           exception supply status are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, K, L, M, N, R, and P. For due-in
           details without status and exception supply status is required, the ILS-S creates
           follow-up (AT*) transactions according to the following schedule:
               5.2.77.4.1.2.1. Requisition Priorities 01-03. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 7 days after the requisition was created.
               5.2.77.4.1.2.2. Requisition Priorities 04-08. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 9 days after the requisition was created.
               5.2.77.4.1.2.3. Requisition Priorities 09-15. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 22 days after the requisition was created.
           5.2.77.4.1.3. Non-NSN and/or REX Code 5 Assigned. If the fifth position of a
           due-in stock number is alpha, then the item does not contain a National Stock
           Number (NSN). Initial follow-up (AT*) transactions for due-in details without
           status that contain a non-NSN stock number and/or items that contain a REX code
           5 are created under the following schedules:
               5.2.77.4.1.3.1. Requisition Priority 01-03. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 10 days after the requisition was created.
               5.2.77.4.1.3.2. Requisition Priority 04-08. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 15 days after the requisition was created.
               5.2.77.4.1.3.3. Requisition Priority 09-15. A follow-up (AT*) transaction
               will be produced 20 days after the requisition was created.
           5.2.77.4.1.4. Status (Follow-up) Counter Update. The ILS-S attempts to acquire
           supply status from supply sources by producing a variety of follow-up
516                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         transactions. Normally, when follow-up transactions are required, the ILS-S
         produces follow-up output transactions and creates new status details. For due-in
         details without status, the ILS-S creates a status detail and changes the current
         status field and date on the status detail to “99”. Status codes 9* are termed status
         counters. The status counter identifies the number of follow-up transactions
         produced for requisitions without status until MILSTRIP status is received. The
         status counter begins with 99 for the first follow-up and is reduced by one (1) for
         each subsequent follow-up transaction produced. For example, on the second
         follow-up of a due-in detail without status, the status counter is reduced to 98,
         third follow-up reduced to 97, etc. Depending on the priority of the requisition,
         the due-in detail will either be deleted by the ILS-S after three follow-up
         transactions with no response, or the status counter will continue to be reduced by
         one. Note: After two (2) follow-up transactions have been produced for priority
         (01-08) due-in details without status, the ILS-S creates an Action Required (ARC)
         transaction for manual review and update. See Para. 5.2.78 for ARC transaction
         format and processing instructions.
      5.2.77.4.2. Follow-up for Service-Managed and Lateral Due-In Details With Status
      (Other Than Cancellation Request (B9/ZC/ZD) Status). The following paragraphs
      concern follow-up processing for Service-managed and lateral support (D**) series
      routing identifier code due-in details containing supply status other than cancellation
      request (B9/ZC/ZD) status. Automated (inline) follow-up transactions are produced
      as follows:
         5.2.77.4.2.1. Initial Follow-up. Follow-up (AF*) transactions will be created by
         the ILS-S using the following schedules:
             5.2.77.4.2.1.1. Requisition Priorities 01-08. A follow-up (AF*) transaction
             will be produced 3 days after the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD).
             5.2.77.4.2.1.2. Requisition Priorities 09-15. A follow-up (AF*) transaction
             will be produced 6 days after the EDD.
         5.2.77.4.2.2. Subsequent Follow-up. Subsequent follow-up (AF*) transactions
         will be based on the status detail's Date of Last Transaction (DOLT) as follows:
             5.2.77.4.2.2.1. Requisition Priorities 01-03. Action Required (ARC) follow-
             up transactions are produced every 5 days until offline action is taken.
             5.2.77.4.2.2.2. Requisition Priorities 04-08. The second follow-up (AF*)
             transaction will be produced 5 days after the first follow-up. Subsequent
             follow-up transactions will be produced in the ARC format. ARC follow-up
             transactions will be produced every 5 days until offline action is taken.
             5.2.77.4.2.2.3. Requisition Priorities 09-15. The second and third follow-up
             (AF*) transactions will be created 10 days after the first follow-up. If no
             reply is received from the first, second, or third follow-up transaction, and no
             due-outs or ISSL/NASSL/MSSL details exist, the ILS-S will delete the due-in
             detail with status code Z7. Additionally, the item record will be flagged for
             re-leveling action. See Ch 2 for more information on re-leveling. Note: If
             AE* status is received, the follow-up counter will be shifted to the previous
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                517


               status field and the follow-up will be restarted based on the revised EDD.
        5.2.77.4.3. Follow-up for Service-Managed and Lateral Due-In Details With
        Cancellation Request (B9/ZC/ZD) Status. The ILS-S produces follow-up transactions
        for Service-managed and lateral support due-in details that contain due-in
        cancellation request (B9/ZC/ZD) status. Automated (inline) follow-up transactions
        are created by the ILS-S as follows:
            5.2.77.4.3.1. Request for Due-In Cancellation Follow-up (AK*) Transaction. If a
            MILSTRIP cancellation status (AE*) transaction is not received for a due-in
            cancellation request (AC*) transaction, a request for due-in cancellation follow-up
            (AK1) transaction will be produced when the status detail date of last transaction
            (DOLT) is greater than 9 days. A second cancellation request follow-up (AK*)
            transaction will be created 10 days after the first follow-up transaction is
            produced. See Para 5.2.92 for AC* and AK* transaction formats and processing
            instructions.
            5.2.77.4.3.2. Automatic Due-in Detail Deletion. If no status reply is received to
            the second follow-up requisition cancellation request follow-up (AK*) transaction
            for a routine (09-15) requisition, the ILS-S will create and process a MILSTRIP
            status (AE*) transaction with status code Z7. See Para’s 5.2.78 and 5.2.88 for
            more information concerning Z7 status code. The ILS-S will delete the due-in
            and all corresponding status details. Note: If a Billed-Not-Received (BNR)
            detail exists when the due-in detail is deleted, the ILS-S will create a Claims
            Receivable (CR) detail if the item is part of an Other Service Stock Fund (OSSF)/
            DLA with a value greater than $100, or a GSA item with a value greater than $25.
     5.2.77.5. Action Required (ARC) Transaction. Action Required (ARC) transactions
     containing AT* (reinstatement) in positions 71-73 are produced when normal follow-up
     (AF*) transactions have failed to obtain required status from Air Force, DLA, GSA, or
     other Service sources of supply. Additionally, the ILS-S automated (inline) follow-up
     program will produce ARC transactions using the same methodology for local purchase
     due-in details. For priority designators 01-08 requisitions with corresponding status
     details, the ILS-S produces ARC transactions on the third follow-up attempt. ARC
     transactions are also produced for priority designators 09-15 requisitions with
     corresponding status details on the fourth follow-up attempt.
        5.2.77.5.1. ARC Transaction Processing. Perform the following actions when ARC
        transactions are received:
            5.2.77.5.1.1. Change the document identifier code (DIC). If the due-in is still
            valid, blank positions 71-73 and enter the appropriate requisition reinstatement
            (AT*) document identifier code (DIC) as shown in the Table 5.87
            5.2.77.5.1.2. Requisition reinstatement. If the document date for a requisition is
            less than 120 days old, submission of a requisition reinstatement (AT*) follow-up
            transaction will cause the source of supply to reinstate the requisition and provide
            MILSTRIP status. Note: Be careful when submitting requisition reinstatement
            (AT*) follow-up transactions because they may result in duplicate shipments and
            billings.
 518                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


               5.2.77.5.1.3. Requisition cancellation request. If the requirement for the
               requisition no longer exists, submit a requisition cancellation request (AC1)
               transaction to the source of supply.
       5.2.77.6. Lateral Support Requisition Follow-up. Lateral support due-in details are
       designated by routing identifier codes JLS or D**. The ILS-S creates initial follow-up
       transactions for lateral support requisitions according to the following schedules:
          5.2.77.6.1. Requisition Priority 01-08.      A follow-up (AF*) transaction is
          programmatically produced 25 days after the requisition date.
          5.2.77.6.2. Requisition Priority 09-15.        A follow-up (AF*) transaction is
          programmatically produced 35 days after the requisition date. Subsequent follow-ups
          will be in the form of action required (ARC) transactions.
       5.2.77.7. Local Purchase Requisition Follow-up. Requisition follow-up (AF*) and
       reinstatement (AT*) transactions are also produced by the ILS-S for Standard
       Procurement System (SPS) local purchase items. The type of follow-up transaction
       produced depends upon the priority of the requisition and whether the status detail
       contains status. Follow-up transactions will be produced as follows:
          5.2.77.7.1. Local Purchase Requisitions Without Status. The ILS-S will create initial
          follow-up (AT*) transactions for local purchase requisitions as shown in Table 5.88
          If a local purchase due-in detail reflects an NSN, or the item contains a REX code 5
          item, and no status detail exists, the ILS-S will output a requisition reinstatement
          (AT*) transaction. The date of the follow-up will be based on the priority group,
          requisition date, and DOLT.

          5.2.77.7.2. Local Purchase Requisitions With Status. The ILS-S will create (AF*)
          and/or subsequent (ARC) follow-up transactions for local purchase due-in details
          containing supply status other than B9, ZC, and ZD (cancellation request) status as
          shown in Table 5.89 The date of the follow-up will be based on the priority group,
          EDD, and DOLT.

            5.2.77.7.3. Local Purchase Due-in Details With Cancellation Request (B9/ZC/ZD)
            Status. Request for cancellation supply status for local purchase due-in details is
            designated by cancellation request status codes B9, ZC, and ZD. The first, second
            (AK1), and subsequent (ARC) follow-up transactions for local purchase requisition
            cancellation requests in the ILS-S will be created on DOLT + 10 days, regardless of
            priority group.
            5.2.77.7.4. Action Required (ARC) Transaction for Local Purchase Requisitions.
            The LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible for ARC transactions for
            local purchase requisitions, routing identifier Jxx. ARC transactions are created on
            the third and subsequent follow-ups for local purchase requisitions. Position 71 of the
            ARC transaction will be blank and positions 72-76 will contain the purchase order
            number. If Base Contracting has not replied to follow-up transactions within
            established schedules, an Action Required (ARC) transaction will be created by the
            ILS-S and forwarded to Stock Control for processing. Note:                The Standard
            Procurement System (SPS) does not accept ARC transactions. Therefore, Customer
            Service must change the transaction DIC to the appropriate follow-up transaction DIC
            prior to submission to Base Contracting. Customer Service will contact Base
            Contracting to obtain current status for local purchase requisitions that have produced
            ARC output transactions. If the local purchase requirement no longer exists,
            Customer Service will process local purchase cancellation (LCC) transactions to
            cancel local purchase due-in details. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 3 for LCC
            transaction format and processing instructions. Local procedures will be established
            between LRS/Materiel Management Activity Customer Service and Base Contracting
            to ensure prompt action is taken on ILS-S local purchase requisition action required
            (ARC) transactions. Once ARC transactions have been produced, no other automated
            follow-up (AF*) transactions will be produced by the ILS-S. Note: New ARC
            transactions are programmatically created every 10 days until updated status is
            processed in the ILS-S, or local purchase requisitions are canceled.
         5.2.77.8. Local Manufacture Follow-up Process. Local manufacture due-in details are
         designated by JBD, JBI, JBT, and JBE routing identifier codes. If the ILS-S determines
         follow-up action is required, an F458 MGT notice (Local MFG D/I Exists W/O Required
         Status or Local MFG D/I Cancelled) will be produced. The ILS-S will create an F458
         MGT notice for any local manufacture requisition requiring follow-up regardless of
         whether status exists or not. If status does not exist, an F458 MGT notice will be
         produced 10 days after the requisition was created. If status is not received within 10
         days of the first follow-up, a second follow-up (F458 MGT Notice) will be created. If no
         reply is received within the 10 days following the second follow-up, automatic
         cancellation action will be taken by the ILS-S, and another F458 MGT notice will be
         produced. If status exits, the ILS-S will create an F458 MGT notice 10 days after
         expiration of the EDD. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information and
         processing instructions for F458 MGT notices.

         5.2.78.1. Purpose. To list and explain the various ILS-S follow-up transactions
         produced. ILS-S follow-up transactions are used to obtain initial or improved status, or
         reinstate the requisition at the source of supply.
            5.2.78.1.1. AF(*) Follow-up Transaction. The AF* follow-up transaction is used to
            obtain updated status for requisitions containing status.
            5.2.78.1.2. AFC Follow-up Transaction. The AFC follow-up transaction is used to
            request an improved Estimated Availability Date (EAD) or Estimated Shipment Date
            (ESD) for priority 01-08 requisitions containing status.
            5.2.78.1.3. AT(*) Reinstatement Transaction. The AT* reinstatement transaction is
            used to obtain initial status for due-in details that do not contain status.
            5.2.78.1.4. ARC Follow-up Transaction. The ARC follow-up transaction is used to
            obtain status for requisitions that have not received status from sources of supply or
            Base Contracting.
5.2.78.1.4.1. ARC transactions are not accepted or processed in wholesale or base contracting
systems. The transaction DIC must be changed before transmission. See Para 5.2.77 for
processing procedures.
                  5.2.78.1.4.2. A locally developed program (versus individual ARCs) may be used
                  to streamline corrections for 97 and below counter status.
         5.2.78.2. Output Destination. RPS/main system.
         5.2.78.3. Input. See MILSTRIP Follow-up Transactions listed in Para 5.2.79

Notes:
1. Routing Identifier Code (RIC). If the ILS-S contains a due-in detail with outdated
status and follow-up (AF*) transactions are produced, the RIC is the last known source
of supply indicated in positions 67-69 of the supply status output. If a due-in detail
does not contain status and a follow-up AT* transaction is produced, positions 4-80
will contain duplicate entries from the original requisition (A0*) transaction.
2. Stock Number. AT2/ATB follow-up transactions for part-numbered items must
have the manufacturer's CAGE code entered in positions 8-12 before submission.
Positions 13-22 will contain the manufacturer’s part number.
3. System Designator, Project Code, and Routing Identifier Code. If the due-in is a
local purchase requisition, these fields will be blank on AF* output.
4. Blank or AT*. Review ARC output transactions and validate if the requirement is
still valid. If the requisition is valid, reproduce the ARC output image, change the DIC
to the DIC contained in positions 71-73, and blank positions 71-73. Note: This
procedure does not apply to AT4, AT5, ATD, and ATE transactions. These follow-up
transactions must be submitted via DD Form 1348-6.
5. Blank or AT* and Blank. For local purchase requisitions, position 71 will be blank,
positions 72-76 will contain the purchase order number, position 77 will contain a zero,
and positions 78-80 will contain the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) number.
  5.2.79. Requisition Follow-Up (AFC/FLP) Input Transactions.
        5.2.79.1. Purpose. To explain the use of ILS-S follow-up (AFC/FLP) transactions to
        obtain updated estimated availability or estimated shipment dates.
           5.2.79.1.1. AFC Follow-up Transaction. AFC follow-up transactions are used for
           priority 01-08 requisitions to request an improved Estimated Availability Date (EAD)
           or Estimated Shipment Date (ESD) from the source of supply.
           5.2.79.1.2. FLP Follow-up Transaction. FLP follow-up transactions are used for
           priority 09-15 requisitions to request an improved EAD or ESD. Note: When FLP

is input against a Billed-Not-Received (BNR) shipment status detail, no internal
update will be accomplished. NOTE: A locally developed program (versus individual
ARCs) may be used to streamline corrections for 97 and below counter status.
2. Distribution Code. FLP input transactions containing an asterisk (*) in this field
will delete all status details except Billed-Not-Received (BNR) and local purchase
status details and create a new follow-up status detail for the quantity in positions 25-
29. Note: This quantity will not exceed the due-in detail quantity. AF1 must be in
positions 78-80 if this option is used.
3. Blank or AT*. For local purchase requisitions, the following fields are not
required for input, but will be generated in the output AFC: position 71 will be
blank, positions 72-76 will contain the purchase order number, position 77 will
contain a zero, and positions 78-80 will contain the Blanket Purchase Agreement
(BPA) number.
4. Blank. If follow-up (FLP) transactions are input and automatic output of AF1
transactions is required, enter AF1 in positions 78-80. Otherwise, leave this field
blank. If follow-up (AFC) transactions are input and automatic output of AFC is
required, enter AFC in positions 78-80. Otherwise, leave this field blank.

      5.2.80.3. Method to Request Supply Assistance. A request for assistance may be
      accomplished by electronic mail (computer--DDN), message, letter, or telephone to the
      appropriate supply source.
  5.2.81. Requisition Reconciliation.
      5.2.81.1. Requisitions eligible for MOV reconciliation. Reconciliation request (AN*)
      transactions will be produced by each DoD or Air Force source of supply and sent to each
      base requisitioning activity that contains an active requisition in the wholesale supply
      system. See Para 5.2.82 for AN* transaction format and processing instructions. The
      input of the reconciliation request into the ILS-S causes the system to generate
      reconciliation response (AP*) transactions. See Para 5.2.83 for AP* transaction format
      and processing instructions. A reconciliation cutoff date is set for 75 days prior to the
      source of supply cutoff date. Reconciliation transactions are sent for requisitions
      containing UMMIPS priorities 01 through 08 and have been on backorder for at least 30
      days. For base requisitions containing priorities 09-15, reconciliation transactions are
      sent if the requisition has been on backorder for at least 75 days. Note: Requisitioning
      bases will not receive MOV reconciliation transactions for Military Assistance Program
      (MAP) items. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5D, Equipment Management for associated
      MOV schedule cutoff dates.
      5.2.81.2. MOV Requisition Reinstatement. Requisitioning activities in receipt of
      confirmed cancellation status (BS) as a result of MOV program processing may request
      reinstatement of canceled requisitions within 60 days of the transaction date on the status
      (AE1) transaction. When an AE1 transaction containing a BS status code is processed in
      the ILS-S and an associated due-in detail is established, the system will create an MOV
      reinstatement request (APR) transaction for the source of supply reflected on the AE1
      status transaction. See Para 5.2.86 for more information and APR transaction format.
      5.2.81.3. Integrated accounts payable system (IAPS) billed-not-received (BNR) follow-
      up to supply for receiving report. The Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS) Billed
      Not Received (BNR) Follow-up to Supply for Receiving Report identifies items that have
      a vendor bill presented for payment, but the receipt has not processed by the retail
      Materiel Management Activity. A separate letter is produced for each invoice entered
      into IAPS where no receiving report exists. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
      personnel will use this listing and letters to reconcile vendor bills with the LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity receiving records, and to receive receiving reports. Local purchase
      items will appear on the listing seven (7) days after the vendor bill is received and
      processed in the SPS. See Ch 3 for processing instructions for this listing.

1. The data elements for these fields will come from supply status transactions (AE*)
with status code BS.
2. Routing identifier will be the last known source.
3. Due-in detail advice code.
4. The day the AE1, status code BS, was created.
  5.2.87. Requisition Status.
      5.2.87.1. Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) Policy.
      MILSTRIP procedural guidance requires supply sources or management control activities
      (MCA) provide status to designated activities as a notice of action taken or being taken
      on MILSTRIP documents received. Status is supplied in the form of either Supply or
      Shipment status, prepared by supply sources in the approved MILSTRIP format. Status
      may be informational or used to request additional data from requisitioning activities
      based upon the status code. Status (AE*) transactions received from supply sources will
      be forwarded through DLATS to requisitioning activities. Note:           Retail materiel
      management activities are provided status based upon the media and status (M&S) code
      assigned to ILS-S requisitions.
      5.2.87.2. Media and Status (M&S) Code. The type and amount of status produced and
      provided to retail materiel management activities is determined by the media and status
      (M&S) code used on the requisition. The M&S code is used to tell the source of supply
      what type and amount of status to provide, and when to provide it.
      5.2.87.3. DLATS Status Processing. In addition to supply sources furnishing status, the
      DLATS generates status as a result of stock number editing. DLATS furnishes status
      back to the requisitioning activity using the unique document identifier code (DIC) AE9
      status transaction.
      5.2.87.4. Types of Requisition Status. Sources of supply provide MILSTRIP status for
      each submitted requisition. There are different types of MILSTRIP requisition supply
      status generated at the source of supply: Exception, 100 Percent, Cancellation/Rejection,
      Direct Delivery Notice, Shipment, and Acknowledgement. Additionally, the ILS-S
      generates two types of status: Cancellation Request and Follow-up status. See Para
      5.2.87.7 for complete processing procedures for each type of status processed in the ILS-
      S. See Para 5.2.88 for a complete list of requisition status codes with associated
      explanations.
          5.2.87.4.1. Exception Supply Status. Exception supply status is requested using
          media and status (M&S) codes 2, 3, 4, 5, K, M, or N on the requisition (A0*)
          transaction. When exception supply status is requested, updated status in the form of
          AE* transactions will be provided when exception-type conditions occur. Examples
          of exception-type status conditions are: Backorder; Direct Delivery; Substitution;
          Passing, and Cancellation Acknowledgement. See Para 5.2.89 for the MILSTRIP
          status (AE*) transaction format and processing instructions.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 531


        5.2.87.4.2. 100% supply status. This type of status is provided as a notice of all
        actions taken or being taken by supply sources on ILS-S requisitions. This includes
        all positive supply action decisions, applicable exception non-positive supply action
        decisions, and combinations thereof. One hundred percent status is automatically
        requested for all priority 01-08 requisitions. When used, bases are advised of any
        changes in status or actions taken by the source of supply. The ILS-S creates and
        sends follow-up transactions (AF*) on requisitions before the standard delivery date
        (SDD) has passed to reduce most of the manual workload required.
        5.2.87.4.3. Cancellation/rejection status. Cancellation/rejection status has the worst
        effect on a retail Materiel Management Activity in terms of supplier support. A
        requisition may be canceled or rejected for various reasons. For example, the
        requisition may not meet system requirements, or a logistical situation may stop the
        order from being filled as described in the following paragraphs. See AFMAN 23-
        122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning, for procedures to perform status updates for
        cancellation/rejection status.
        5.2.87.4.4. Intransit/shipment status. When a requisitioned item reaches the
        transportation stage, intransit/shipment status is provided using a shipment status
        (AS*) transaction. The shipment status (AS*) transaction provides the LRS/
        transportation activity data such as mode of shipment and date shipped to update
        requisition status details. See Para 5.2.90 for shipment status (AS*) transaction
        format and processing instructions. The requisition (due-in) record should remain in
        the ILS-S until the item is physically received and a receipt transaction is processed at
        the base. If the receipt is not processed in the ILS-S within established timeframe, the
        ILS-S will automatically initiate tracer action and attempt to determine shipment
        location throughout the logistics pipeline. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
        Requisitioning for more information concerning the tracing of overdue requisitions.
        5.2.87.4.5. Acknowledgement status. Acknowledgement status can be used to
        provide either supply or shipment status to the requisitioning base. This type of status
        is provided as a response to Material Obligation Validation (MOV) response (AP*)
        transactions, cancellation request/follow-up (AC1/AK1) transactions, requisition
        modifier (AM*) transactions, and follow-up request for improved Estimated
        Shipment Date (ESD) transactions.
     5.2.87.5. Local Purchase Requisition Status. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     manages local purchase requisition procedures for Standard Procurement System (SPS).
     Base Contracting will assign status to local purchase requisitions for input to the ILS-S
     during daily (inline) processing. Base Contracting produces a variety of local purchase
     status transactions (with local purchase coding) to the ILS-S to update internal records.
     See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 3B, Local Purchase and Retail Sales for local purchase
     procedures.
     5.2.87.6. Field manufacture and base civil engineer (BCE) local manufacture supply
     status. A separate supply status (AE*) transaction is prepared and processed to update
     status on the ILS-S due-in detail for the local manufactured item. See Para 5.2.93 for
     status (AE*) transaction format and processing instructions for Field Manufacture units.
532                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      See Para 5.2.94 for AE* transaction format and processing instructions for Base Civil
      Engineering units.
      5.2.87.7. Processing ILS-S Requisition Status.
         5.2.87.7.1. Status (AE*) Transaction. The ILS-S receives and generates supply
         status from DoD and Air Force sources of supply via MILSTRIP status (AE*)
         transactions. See Para 5.2.89 for MILSTRIP status (AE*) transaction format and
         processing instructions. Additionally, the DLATS subjects base requisition (A0*)
         transactions to Air Force-approved edits to ensure selected requisition data elements
         are valid and consistent. Updates resulting from DLATS edits are communicated to
         the ILS-S via AE* transactions. The processing of AE* transactions results in the
         programmatic update of requisition data elements in the due-in detail record (202).
         5.2.87.7.2. Processing Cancellation/Rejection Status. Depending on the status code
         and situation, different actions and transaction exception codes (TEX) may be
         required to complete requisition processing. See Para 2.2.51 for procedures to cancel
         push due-ins (99S). The following paragraphs detail specific instructions for
         processing the most common types of rejection/cancellation status you will receive.
         See Para 5.2.88 for a complete list and explanation of each type of status code that
         may be received. Manual processing procedures for status codes BF, CA, CW, ZG,
         and ZH are located in AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning.
             5.2.87.7.2.1. Cancellation Status Codes B4, BQ, BS, C6, CB, CD, FB, FC, FJ,
             and Z7. The ILS-S processes AE* transaction status codes B4, BQ, BS, C6, CB,
             CD, FB, FC, FJ and Z7 as follows:
                 5.2.87.7.2.1.1. If a customer due-out is not on file, the due-in detail will be
                 deleted and the item record flagged for releveling.
                 5.2.87.7.2.1.2. If a customer due-out is on file, the current date and the input
                 status code will be stored in the due-in document number field of the due-out
                 detail. The 205-MEMO-DUO-DESIGNATOR will be changed to memo.
                 Note: When CB status (not available) is processed, an F407 MGT notice
                 (Quantity not Available for Immediate Release) will be produced. When FJ
                 status (previous MRO/RDO) is processed, an F428 MGT notice (Supply
                 Action Denied MRO-RDO) will be output. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
                 7 for more information concerning F407 and F428 MGT notices.
             5.2.87.7.2.2. Cancellation Status Codes B6, B8, and B9. If status codes B6, B8,
             or B9 are processed against a due-in when no request for cancellation (AC*) has
             been produced, an F481 MGT notice (No Request for Cancellation (ZC/ZD) On
             File) will be output. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information
             concerning F481 MGT notices.
             5.2.87.7.2.3. Cancellation Status Code CD (Error Conditions Exist). If CD status
             is processed and no request for requisition cancellation (ZC/ZD) status exists, the
             ILS-S will automatically prepare a SPR input transaction for re-requisitioning
             action. If requisition cancellation request status (ZC/ZD) exists, the ILS-S will
             produce a request for cancellation (AC*) transaction.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 533


           5.2.87.7.2.4. Cancellation Status Code CS (Excessive Quantity). The ILS-S will
           generate a special requisition (SPR) transaction with a 2L requisition advice code
           when CS cancellation status is received and either of the following conditions
           exist:
               5.2.87.7.2.4.1. The requisition (due-in) is marked for a customer due-out, and
               only a partial of the requisition quantity is rejected.
               5.2.87.7.2.4.2. The requisition (due-in) is marked for stock replenishment,
               and the rejected quantity either equals the due-in quantity or is greater than the
               demand level. If the canceled requisition quantity canceled equals the due-in
               quantity or is greater than the demand level, the ILS-S will generate a F409
               MGT notice (QTY Field or REQN Suspect of Error, ReREQN). See AFH
               23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for processing instructions concerning F409 MGT
               notices.
           5.2.87.7.2.5. Cancellation Status Code ZR (Excessive Value). Cancellation
           status code ZR indicates the extended dollar value of the item is greater than the
           maximum limit authorized for the item on a federal supply schedule. The ILS-S
           processes cancellation status code ZR as follows:
               5.2.87.7.2.5.1. If the retail Materiel Management Activity is supported by an
               automated base contracting system, such as Standard Procurement System
               (SPS), the ILS-S will automatically generate an SPR transaction to requisition
               the item from the applicable supply source.
               5.2.87.7.2.5.2. If a nonautomated base contracting system applies, or a local
               purchase status detail is on file, a 433 REJ notice (MILSTRIP Status Cannot
               Be Processed Against LP Requisitions)is produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
               Pt 2, Ch 7 for processing instructions.
        5.2.87.7.3. Exception Supply Status Processing. Exception supply status is requested
        through the use of media and status (M&S) codes 2, 3, 4, 5, K, M, or N contained on
        the requisition (A0*) transaction. When exception supply status is requested, updated
        status in the form of AE* status transactions will be provided. The following status
        conditions are considered exception supply status:
           5.2.87.7.3.1. BB Status. Requisition is placed on backorder.
           5.2.87.7.3.2. BV/BZ Status. Requisition is being processed for procurement and
           direct delivery from a vendor or contractor.
           5.2.87.7.3.3. BH Status. A substitute item is being provided.
           5.2.87.7.3.4. BM Status. The requisition is passed to another source of supply, or
           any referral actions have been taken.
           5.2.87.7.3.5. Other Status. Any other circumstance which indicates release of
           required material may not be made within the time period established for the
           assigned priority designator.
           5.2.87.7.3.6. Restricted Use and Limitations of Exception Status. Exception
           status should be used for, but limited to, priority 09-15 requisitions since its use
534                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         reduces the effectiveness of the system’s automatic follow-up process. Exception
         status prevents the ILS-S from performing follow-up on requisitions until the
         Standard Delivery Date (SDD) has passed. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order
         and Requisitioning for information about submitting follow-ups to the source of
         supply through the ILS-S.
         5.2.87.7.3.7. Requisitions (Due-Ins) with Shipment Status. The ILS-S will not
         cancel a requisition (due-in) if shipment status exists. The ILS-S will disregard
         the AE* status transaction.
         5.2.87.7.3.8. All Other Cancellation Status. The ILS-S will process all other
         cancellation status as follows:
             5.2.87.7.3.8.1. Due-in/Due-out/Status Detail Update. The ILS-S will delete
             due-in and all associated status details for canceled requisitions without
             shipment status. If a customer due-out (DUO) record exists, the ILS-S will
             change the due-out to memo, blank the due-in document number, store the
             cancellation status code in the last two positions of the due-in document
             number field of the due-out detail.
      5.2.87.7.4. Positive Supply Status. The ILS-S processes positive supply status codes
      received as follows:
         5.2.87.7.4.1. Partial Status Transactions. Each partial status transaction should
         contain a suffix code on the AE* transaction. If the input AE* status transaction
         contains a suffix code, and the input suffix code equals an existing status detail,
         the ILS-S updates the existing status detail. If no matching status detail is on file
         for the requisition number, the system creates a new status detail using the input
         data from the suffixed status transaction. After initial processing is completed,
         the total quantity on the status detail is compared to the total quantity on the due-
         in detail. The system will automatically delete any excess status detail quantities
         created due to status processing. The ILS-S deletes the excess status quantities in
         order, starting with exception status and continuing through shipped status until
         the total quantity on the status details equals the quantity on the due-in detail.
         Note: The due-in detail for the input status requisition number will not be
         adjusted during this process.
         5.2.87.7.4.2. Partial Status Without Suffix Code. Partial status received for
         requisitions without a suffix code should only be received when a base initiates a
         cancellation request (AC*) transaction. Note: The following types of status and
         status codes apply:
             5.2.87.7.4.2.1. Status codes B8 and B9 (action has been denied or is pending).
             5.2.87.7.4.2.2. Shipment    status   showing     shipment    data    (mode    of
             shipment/date).
             5.2.87.7.4.2.3. Other positive status indicating the due-in cannot be canceled.
         5.2.87.7.4.3. Total Status Transactions. If the input quantity on the AE* status
         transaction equals the quantity on the due-in detail, the ILS-S creates a
         corresponding status detail.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                535


        5.2.87.7.5. Transaction History Records. For any status code received that directly
        affects the due-in detail, the retail system will record a transaction history event for
        the status. The ILS-S automatically writes and stores a transaction history record
        when the due-in detail quantity, signal code, or other indicative data are changed
        during status processing.
        5.2.87.7.6. Interchangeable and Substitute Linkage. The ILS-S automatically links
        interchangeable and substitute items together when status is received on any stock
        number in an interchangeable and substitute group. The Primary Supply Point (PSP)
        will not ship substitute items to FSLs. FSL stocks are limited to master and
        interchangeable items in the D043 interchangeable and substitute group (ISG). The
        FSL will not assign ISG relations different from those reflected in D043. Local ISG
        relationships are not authorized at en route locations. Note: If the units of issue are
        different for linked stock numbers, the system will link the two stock numbers
        together as substitutes.
        5.2.87.7.7. Estimated Shipping Date (ESD). Positions 70-73 of the AE* status input
        contain the ESD from the source of supply. If the ESD is not provided on the AE*
        transaction, the ILS-S computes the ESD based upon UMMIPS standards and places
        the computed date in the ESD position of the status detail. See Para 5.2.4.16 for
        more information concerning UMMIPS standards.
        5.2.87.7.8. ILS-S Record Update. When status (AE*) transactions to create or
        change status details process in the ILS-S, other internal system records are updated
        as follows:
           5.2.87.7.8.1. Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR). If the quantity
           requisitioned is reduced, or the price changes, the ILS-S will update the MACR.
           5.2.87.7.8.2. Routing Identifier Record. The ILS-S will update individual status
           codes on the routing identifier record for each source of supply. See AFH 23-123,
           Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for details.
           5.2.87.7.8.3. Item Record. If the ILS-S receives a status (AE*) transaction for a
           stock number that is not loaded, the system will format an item record load (FIL)
           transaction without the unit price, unit of issue, and routing identifier code. These
           elements are derived from the AE* status transaction.
           5.2.87.7.8.4. Item Record Merges. Upon status (AE*) transaction processing, the
           ILS-S will merge item records if: a stock number (NSN) replaces a P (part-
           number), NC (non-cataloged), or ND (non-stocklisted) item; an ND item replaces
           a P number; or an NC item replaces an ND item. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
           Ch 8 for more information concerning item record merges.
           5.2.87.7.8.5. Status management notices. The Stock Control function number or
           enhanced print database will receive output management notices for Priority
           Group one (1) requisitions. Priority Groups 2 and 3 output management notices
           will be sent to Computer Operations or the enhanced print database. Other output
           management notices will be directed to the appropriate function number.
           5.2.87.7.8.6. Receipt Transaction (REC) Images. Receipt transaction (REC) or
536                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         “trigger” images are created and stored in the ILS-S when status (AE*)
         transactions process. This allows for automated receipt processing when items
         due-in are received by LRS/Materiel Management Activity. REC images are also
         produced for partial due-in quantities (differentiated by Suffix Code) when
         positive or shipment status is received. Note: If a due-in quantity or stock
         number change occurs, a replacement receipt transaction image will be produced.
      5.2.87.7.9. Special Status (BN) Processing. BN (Free Issue) status is received from
      the source of supply through AE* status transactions when some or all of the
      requisition quantity will be provided free of cost. Normally, when BN status is
      received, the ILS-S changes the signal code to “D” and advice code to “2E” on
      affected due-in details. Additionally, if BN status is provided for a portion (partial) or
      the due-in quantity, the ILS-S creates additional status details (each suffix code) for
      managing the free amount of the total requisition quantity. Lastly, if the item record
      contains Budget Code Z, the Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO) field of the
      budget code Z MACR is updated.
         5.2.87.7.9.1. BN Status for Contractor ICP Requirements.                When AE*
         transactions contain BN status for Contractor ICPs (RIC equals F(n)(n)) process,
         the ILS-S changes the signal code to D and advice code to 2E on the due-in detail.
         When BN status is processed for partial quantities, the ILS-S decreases the
         requisition quantity accordingly, and establishes partial status details with signal
         code D and advice code 2E for the portion identified as free issue. If the RIC on
         the status (AE*) transaction is different than the RIC on the due-in detail, the ILS-
         S changes the RIC on the due-in detail to match the RIC on the AE* transaction.
         5.2.87.7.9.2. BN Status for Lateral Support Requirements.              When AE*
         transactions contain BN status for Lateral Support (RIC equals JLS/D(**))
         process, the ILS-S changes the signal code to D and advice code to 2E on the due-
         in detail. When BN status is processed for partial quantities, the ILS-S decreases
         the requisition quantity accordingly, and establishes partial status details with
         signal code D and advice code 2E for the portion identified as free issue.
         5.2.87.7.9.3. BN Status for Other Routing Identifier Codes. When AE*
         transactions contain BN status for RICs other than F(n)(n), JLS, or D**, the ILS-S
         will produce a 379 Reject. This reject indicates contact with the source of supply
         is required. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
         5.2.87.7.9.4. BJ/FS (Adjusted to Quantity Unit Pack) Status. A ILS-S requisition
         quantity adjustment (increase or decrease) by the source of supply (to the quantity
         unit pack (QUP) will cause the wholesale supply system to generate an AE*
         status transaction containing BJ or FS status. BJ or FS status identifies the
         amount of the requisition quantity the supply source will ship in positions 25-29.
         Therefore, the ILS-S due-in detail quantity will be changed accordingly to the
         amount on the AE* status transaction. When BJ or FS status is received, the ILS-
         S will adjust the due-in quantity to the AE* status quantity, update the MACR for
         decreased or increased amount, and produce a new receipt (REC) image for the
         adjusted quantity.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                537


        5.2.87.7.10. Response to Requisition Cancellation Request (AC1) Transactions.
        When the requisitioned (due-in) quantity is excessive or no longer required, the ILS-S
        or Stock Control prepares requests for cancellation (RECCANX) transactions for the
        source of supply. See Para 5.2.87.7.1 for RECCANX transaction format and
        processing instructions. After request processing, the retail Materiel Management
        Activity produces request for cancellation (AC1) transactions. The wholesale supply
        activity accepts AC1 transactions and provides MILSTRIP supply status (AE*) or
        shipment status (AU*) transactions in response. See Para 5.2.87.7.2 for format and
        processing instructions for AC1 transactions. If the items have been shipped, the
        source of supply provides shipment status in the form of AU1 transactions. See Para
        5.2.90 for format and processing instructions for AU1 transactions. The most
        common supply status received for cancellation request (AC1) transactions is “BQ”
        status. See Para 5.2.88 for more information concerning BQ status. The ILS-S
        processes AE* transactions received for cancellation request transactions as follows:
           5.2.87.7.10.1. B9 (Pending) Status. B9 status response indicates the requisition
           quantity will either be canceled or shipped to another activity. Later status will be
           provided. If the status code is B9, the ILS-S stores B9 in the current status field
           and shifts ZC/ZD (request for cancellation) status to the previous status field on
           status details.
           5.2.87.7.10.2. Other Than B9 Status. If supply status received is other than
           cancellation status, and more current than the present status, the ILS-S will store
           the AE* transaction status provided in the previous status field on status details.
           In this situation, ZC/ZD (request for cancellation) status will remain as the current
           status.
           5.2.87.7.10.3. B8 (Cannot be Canceled) or AU1 Status Reply. If the response to
           a request for cancellation is an AU1 (a reply to cancellation with shipment status),
           the ILS-S will shift ZC/ZD (request for cancellation) status to the previous status
           field and place the mode of shipment in the current status field on status details.
           For B8 (cannot be canceled) status received, the ILS-S updates the status detail
           with B8 status and flags the due-in detail with an “S” in the suppress cancellation
           flag field. This action suppresses further cancellation request transactions for the
           requisition.
        5.2.87.7.11. FQ (DLATS Fund/Signal Code Change ) Status. DLATS edits ILS-S
        requisition (A0*) transactions for Routing Identifier, Signal, and Fund code
        compatibility. If any combinations of these codes are incompatible on the requisition
        transaction, DLATS assigns the correct combination of the above codes to the
        requisition and routes corrected requisitions to the supply source. When DLATS
        changes ILS-S requisitions in this manner, they notify requisitioning bases through
        AE9 status transactions containing “FQ” status. When AE9 transactions containing
        FQ status are processed in the ILS-S, due-in details are automatically modified to
        identify new Fund, Signal, and/or Routing Identifier codes. After processing, the
        ILS-S writes a transaction history to record the change. See Para 5.2.88 for more
        information concerning FQ status processing.
538                                                 AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.87.7.12. Part-Numbered Requisitions (A0B)/A02). Part-numbered items are
      normally requisitioned in the ILS-S using A0B or A02 transactions. See Para 5.2.37
      for A0B/A02 transaction format, and Para 5.2.36.2 for complete part-number
      requisitioning procedures. DLATS sends ILS-S part-numbered (non-NSN) item
      A0B/A02 requisition transactions to the Defense Integrated Data System (DIDS) to
      determine if the part number requested can be converted to a national stock number
      (NSN). Based on Defense Integrated Data System (DIDS) processing, the following
      actions will occur:
         5.2.87.7.12.1. Part Number Converted. When A0B/A02 part-number items are
         converted to valid stock numbers by DIDS, DLATS will change the requisition
         transaction identifier (DIC) to A0A/A01 (based on location) and route the
         corrected requisition to the source of supply. When ILS-S requisition transactions
         are changed in this manner, DLATS sends the requisitioning base AE9
         transactions containing “BG” status. See Para 5.2.88 for more information
         concerning BG status. Processing the AE9 transaction in the ILS-S will produce
         the following results:
             5.2.87.7.12.1.1. Item record load (FIL) processing. If the AE9 transaction
             NSN is not loaded, an item record load (FIL) transaction for the new NSN is
             processed. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information
             concerning FIL transaction processing.
             5.2.87.7.12.1.2. Item record merge (FIC) processing. During AE9 transaction
             processing, the ILS-S will merge part-numbered and stock number records if
             possible. When the merge data on the part number is incompatible with
             change-to stock number records, a 137 Reject will occur. See AFH 23-123,
             Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 137 Rejects. Research
             personnel will prepare an indicative date change (FIC) transaction to change
             the part-numbered record to be compatible with the change-to stock number
             record. After correcting indicative data on the part number record, the AE9
             transaction with BG status is reprocessed in the ILS-S to merge the records.
             See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning FIC
             transaction processing.
         5.2.87.7.12.2. Part Number Not Converted. If the Defense Indicative Data
         System (DIDS) cannot convert the part number to a stock number, or DIDS
         cannot process the conversion request within six (6) hours, DLATS processes the
         requisition with the assigned part number in positions 8-22 and passes the
         transaction to the source of supply.
      5.2.87.7.13. Supply Status for AWP Requisitions. An S in the requirements
      computation flag field of the due-in detail identifies Awaiting Parts (AWP)
      requisitions. When supply status (AE*) transactions for AWP requisitions are
      received, the ILS-S will create or update status details as required.
      5.2.87.7.14. BV (Direct Delivery from Contractor) Status. When requisitioned items
      are provided directly from contractors or vendors, BV status is provided. The ILS-S
      processes status (AE*) transactions containing BV status as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   539


              5.2.87.7.14.1. RIC Equals JBB. If the item is procured locally (item record RIC
              equals JBB), the ILS-S creates new status details or updates current status on
              existing status details. The status transaction also provides the unit price of the
              item in positions 74-80. Normally, for local purchase items, the item record unit
              price reflects the last purchase price for the item, and may not be the unit price of
              the item supplied. If the unit price reflected on the status transaction is different
              than the item record unit price, the ILS-S will update the unit price to match the
              price received on the status transaction. If the unit price reflected on the status
              transaction equals the item record unit price, no update action is taken. See Para
              5.2.88 for more information concerning BV status processing.
              5.2.87.7.14.2. RIC Not Equal to JBB. If the RIC does not equal JBB, the unit
              price on the item record will not be updated.
   5.2.88. MILSTRIP, Intra-Air Force, And Intra-Base Requisition Status Codes and
   Phrases.
       5.2.88.1. Purpose. To identify and explain the two-position MILSTRIP requisition status
       codes that affect ILS-S requisitions. General MILSTRIP status codes, as well as status
       codes used on intra-Air Force and intra-Base requisitions, are listed below.
       5.2.88.2. General MILSTRIP Requisition Status Codes.

Table 5.97. General MILSTRIP Status Codes.
Code      Phrase/Explanation
B1        Assets not currently available. Requisition will be retained by DLADS for
          60 days from date of receipt awaiting possible arrival of assets. (DLADS
          use only.)
B2        Your requisition modifier (AM*) transaction has been received by the source
          of supply; however, current Supply or Procurement action prevents
          requested modifications from being made.
          Processing: If the requisition is still required, check previous MILSTRIP
          supply status. If the supply source has not provided positive supply or
          shipment status, send a follow-up (AF*) transaction to the source of supply.
          See F421 MGT notice (Requisition Modifier (AMx) in Error – Status Code
          B2) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for additional information.
B4        Canceled. The supply source has received a cancellation request from the
          requisitioner, consignee, manager, or other authorized activity. Processing:
          Do not de-obligate funds. Billing for materiel on contract termination
          changes will be made.
B5        The source of supply identified by positions 4-6 of the requisition received
          your follow-up request.
          Processing: The source of supply will try to determine the current status of
          the requisition and/or improve the estimated shipment date (ESD). Status
          will be furnished again within 7 calendar days.
540                                                   AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      Note: B5 status is used only when previous status codes were BA, BB, BD,
      or BV.
B6    The requisition was canceled and the materiel was shipped to another
      activity.
B7    Unit price change. Positions 74-80 contain the latest unit price for the item
      identified by the stock or part number in positions 8-22.
B8    Quantity requested for cancellation cannot be canceled.
B9    The activity identified by the code in positions 4-6 received your
      cancellation request. Processing: The activity will either cancel the demand
      or ship the materiel to another customer. Do not de-obligate funds or delete
      due-in. Later status reports will tell you about the final action.
BA    The item is being processed for release and shipment. Once a requisitioned
      item has been released off the shelf for shipment, the wholesale source of
      supply considers the requisition completed, closes all active records, and
      places it in the history file.
      Note: According to MILSTRIP directives, the source of supply must
      maintain history files in the wholesale supply system for 180 days.
BB    The item has been backordered against a due-in to stock at the source of
      supply. Positions 70-73 contain the estimated shipping date (ESD) the
      materiel will be released to the customer. (BB may be used for local
      manufacture requisitions.)
BC    The item has been backordered at the source of supply. There will be a long
      delay and the ESD is in positions 70-73. However, an item which is not an
      automatic substitute is available. The price for the substitute item appears in
      positions 74-80.
      Processing: Coordinate with the customer to determine if the substitute item
      is acceptable. If the customer accepts the substitute, submit a requisition
      cancellation request (AC1) transaction for the original requisition and submit
      a new requisition, using a new document number with the current Julian
      date. See F437 MGT notice (Item B/O, Long Delay Anticipated) in AFH
      23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for additional information.
BD    Action on the requisition is delayed because the supply source needs more
      information on the item, such as authorized application, item identification,
      technical data, etc. This code is used on priority 09-15 requisitions when the
      depot item record is frozen. The estimated release date, if known, will be in
      positions 70-73 of the status response. When the review is complete,
      additional status information will appear.
      BD status may also be used to indicate a local manufacture item cannot be
      manufactured because of a lack of part, drawing, etc.
BE    The depot/storage activity has a record of the materiel release order (MRO),
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                            541


        but it has no supporting transaction/record of action taken. BE status occurs
        because the depot or storage activity is responding to an ICP request about
        the MRO status. Applies to AE6 status transactions only.
BF      No record of your document for which your requisition follow-up (AF*) or
        cancellation request (AC1) was submitted.
        a. Follow-up (AF*) Transaction Processing. If BF status was received in
        response to a follow-up (AF*) transaction, the supply source will continue to
        process later documents it receives (A0*, AM*, AT*) with the same
        document number under regular MILSTRIP procedures.
        b. Processing for a Cancellation Request. If this status code was received
        because of a cancellation request, the supply source will return later
        requisitions (A0*) or other transactions (AM*, AT*, etc.) it receives with BF
        status. De-obligate funds and, if the customer still needs the item, submit a
        new requisition using a new document number.
        Note: If you requisition the item with a new document number, submit a
        cancellation request (AC1) transaction before you de-obligate funds.
BG      One or more of the following fields have been changed:
        a. Stock number (as the result of a formal catalog change).
        (1) The requisitioned NSN has been replaced by or consolidated with NSN
        in stock number field.
        (2) The NSN is assigned to the part number that was requisitioned.
        (3) The FSC has changed, but the NIIN remains the same as originally
        requisitioned.
        Processing: Review NSN (FSC and NIIN) to make certain the requisition
        being processed is for desired item. If the NSN is not for the desired item,
        submit a cancellation request to the source of supply.
        b. Unit of issue was changed because of a formal catalog change.
        c. The requisitioned part number has been identified to or replaced by the
        part number shown in the stock number field.
        Processing: Check the quantity and unit price as a result of this part number
        change. The supply source will provide additional status to indicate further
        action on this requisition.
BH      The customer will receive a service coordinated, approved substitute,
        interchangeable item identified in the stock number field.
        Processing: Check the unit of issue, quantity, and unit price fields for
        possible changes. Additional status will be provided. See F400 MGT notice
        (Input SN) Being Supplied ILO (Requisitioned SN) and F401 MGT notice
        (FSC of Item Supplied Unequal to Item Ordered) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
        2, Ch 7 for additional information.

BJ    The wholesale supply system has changed the requisition quantity to
      conform to quantity unit pack (QUP) and adjusted the requisition quantity
      accordingly. The unit of issue is not changed. If the requisition quantity is
      increased, the ILS-S assigns suppress cancellation flag S.
BK    Requisition data elements have been modified by DLATS as follows:
      DIC AE9 advises that the requisition contained a requisition priority for
      which the activity was not authorized. The requisition priority has been
      changed as shown and the requisition forwarded for processing.
      DIC AE9 advises that the requisition contained an invalid or expired Project
      Code. The project code has been changed and the requisition forwarded for
      processing. Priority and project code changes resulting from the processing
      of BK status transactions are summarized in F079 MGT Notices (Requisition
      Was Modified By Source of Supply). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7
      for additional information.
BL    On the date in positions 70-73, notice of availability was sent to the country
      representative of freight forwarder.
BM    Your document was sent to the activity indicated in positions 67-69. Send
      all future transactions for the item to that activity.
BN    The requisition is being processed as a free issue. Signal and fund code
      fields have been corrected as noted.
BO    Not used.
BP    Requisition has been deferred per customer instructions. ESD is in position
      70-73. (Currently SBSS converts status code "BP" to "BZ" requisition is

      definition and logic will be incorporated into future SBSS modernization
      efforts IAW MILSTRIP regulations.
BQ    Canceled. This status is the response of receiving a cancellation request
      (AC1) transaction from the requisitioner, consignee, manager, or other
      authorized activity.
      Note: For AMC (FSS) lateral requisitions, submit a new lateral requisition
      to fill the quantity that was canceled.
BR    Canceled. Requisitioning activity authorized cancellation in response to
      Materiel Obligation Validation (MOV) reconciliation request furnished by
      the wholesale supply system.
BS    Canceled. The requisitioning activity failed to respond to a MOV
      reconciliation request from the wholesale supply system.
BU    The item is being supplied against your foreign military sales (FMS) case
      designator shown in positions 48-50 or against your Grant Aid program and
      record control number (RCN) shown in positions 46-50. This document is a
      duplicate of the requisition prepared by the US Military Service source. See
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                            543


        F438 MGT notice (Item Being Supplied Against Your FMS Case
        Designator) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for additional information.
BV      Item has been procured and is on contract for direct shipment to consignee.
        Positions 70-73 contain the contract shipping date. If the requisitioner
        cancels the requisition, they may be billed for contract termination and
        transportation costs.
BW      The International Logistics Control Office (ILCO) has received your foreign
        military sales (FMS) or Grant Aid requisition containing this document
        number and submitted it to the ILS-S. A current estimated shipping date
        (ESD) is not available, but a later status report will provide it. The ILCO
        may use this status code to acknowledge the receipt of a requisition or to
        reply to a follow-up when an ESD is not available.
BX      Not used.
BY      Depot/storage has previously denied the materiel release order (MRO) by
        document identifier code A6*.
BZ      The requisition is being processed for direct delivery procurement. When
        necessary procurement action is finished, additional status will be provided
        to indicate the action taken. The estimated shipping date is in positions 70-
        73. The ILS-S currently consolidates status code "BP" (Requisition has been
        deferred per customer instructions. ESD is in position 70-73) into "BZ"
        status. Correct "BP" status definition and logic will be incorporated into
        future SBSS modernization efforts IAW MILSTRIP regulations.

           2, Ch 7 for additional information.
 FY        Rejected. The part number requisitioned is not the preferred item, and has
           been related to another part number with an assigned NSN which is not used
           by the Air Force. AFMC IM has initiated catalog action to register the Air
           Force as a user.
           Processing: If the part number requisitioned is not available, submit a new
           requisition with a new document number and a current Julian date using the
           stock number (positions 8-22) and routing identifier (positions 67-69)
           identified on the status (AE*) transaction.
 FZ        Canceled. The requisition has been canceled because requisitioned items
           changed from non-marginal analysis to marginal analysis. See F455 MGT
           notice (Push Asset Application WRM) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for

           item. The requisition was canceled because AFEMS did not receive the
           authorization from your base.
           Processing: If the item is still required, submit a new requisition with a new
           document number and a current Julian date. See F410 MGT notice (Item
           Requisitioned is COMSEC Equipment) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7

   5.2.90. Shipment Status (AS*/AU*) Input Transaction.
        5.2.90.1. Purpose. The Shipment Status (AS*) and Shipment Status Follow-up (AU*)
        transactions provide the requisitioning base shipment information. For example,
        shipment status transactions provide the Estimated Shipment Date (ESD) and the mode of
        shipment. The ESD identifies items released for shipment; actual shipping date, or the
        date items will be released to a shipment carrier. Lastly, shipment status also provides
        interface data for base Transportation functions for shipment planning. Additionally,
        shipment status provides data for requisition tracing action if required.

less than the current date.
  5.2.91. Requisition Cancellation Request (RECCANC) Input Transaction.
      5.2.91.1. Purpose. The Due-In Cancellation Request (RECCANC) input transaction is
      used to request cancellation from supply sources for retail materiel management
      requisitions. The request for cancellation transaction may be automatically processed by
      the ILS-S or manually processed by Customer Service or AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
      Activity personnel. If processed by the ILS-S, the current status field is changed to “ZD”
      on status details. Note: ILS-S requests for due-in cancellation are generated when due-
      in excess is computed by File Status processing. See Para 5.2.91.2                for more
      information concerning File Status processing. If request for due-in cancellation is
      manually processed, the current status field is changed to “ZC” on status details. See
      Para 5.2.87.7 for general processing instructions for requesting due-in cancellation
      action. The ILS-S produces request for cancellation (AC1) output transactions for each
      due-in cancellation request processed.
      5.2.91.2. File Status processing. File status must be processed against all item records at
      least once each quarter. File status on item records with an alpha budget code or a budget
      code 8 must be initiated and completed during the first week of each new quarter. This is
      essential because file status writes TTPC 4G transaction history records that the D28
      report uses to provide updated usage data to the Readiness Based Leveling system at
      AFMC. (If the MAJCOM determines that file status will be processed more frequently,
      Computer Operations must run program S01/NGV815 see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch
      16; this program blanks the item record file status quarter code.) Stock Control must
      determine the type of excess to be processed. Stock Control must also, together with the
      Computer Operations, carefully schedule the quarterly file status processing so that the
      output does not create an excessive workload for other flights within the ILS-S.

   5.2.92. Requisition Cancellation Request (AC1/AK1) Output Transaction.
       5.2.92.1. Purpose. The cancellation request (AC1/AK1) output transaction is used to
       request cancellation of retail materiel management requisitions from the source of supply.
       When the source of supply receives the cancellation request (AC1/AK1) transaction, they
       will provide cancellation status (AE*) transactions to cancel the requisition or shipment
       status (AS*) transactions as applicable when the requisition has been released for
       shipment. Cancellation request transactions are prepared during automated follow-up or
       as the result of processing a due-in cancellation request (REC) transaction with TEX code
       E.

   5.2.95. Requisition Tracing.
      5.2.95.1. Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures (MILSTAMP).
      MILSTAMP tracer reconciliation program (NGV597) is used to identify shipments that
      have been delayed or misplaced between the shipping and receiving activities. The LRS,
564                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      Transportation and the Supply activities must work together to research and trace
      delinquent requisitions (shipments) identified by the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
      (NGV597) program. This requirement also applies to the Receiving and Cargo
      Movement functions performed by the DLA Distribution at the ALCs. Therefore, any
      reference to Cargo Movement and Receiving in this chapter also includes the DLA
      Distribution performing the Receiving and Cargo Movement functions at the ALCs.
      Note: Cargo Movement responsibilities are defined in AFI 24-203.
         5.2.95.1.1. MILSTAMP tracer reconciliation program logic. Various output listings
         and transactions are produced to assist with the identification, tracing, and receipt of
         delayed or lost requisitions (shipments).        For more information about the
         MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation program, output products, and distribution
         instructions, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6.
         5.2.95.1.2. ES-S Late Inbound Shipment Process. The ES-S “Manage Late Inbound
         Serviceable Shipments” process automates the current manual SBSS Tracer Action
         Required (TAR) process. ES-S programmatically identifies (up to two weeks earlier)
         late inbound serviceable shipments based upon existing delivery time standards and
         manages these shipments by creating and updating internal records. For each late
         inbound serviceable shipment identified, ES-S queries the Global Transportation
         Network (GTN) for updated shipment status, and when applicable, generates
         shipment status (AS1) transactions for processing and update action in the SBSS.
         Additionally, ES-S generates reports that prompt the user (role-based) to select
         appropriate action to resolve late inbound shipments and automatically produce and
         transmit all transactions (TAR/AS1/AE1/SPR/1GP/REC/FFC) required to update ES-
         S late inbound shipment and associated SBSS records. See Ch 16 in the ES-S User
         Manual for more information.
      5.2.95.2. Requisition Tracing Requirements.
         5.2.95.2.1. Positive shipment notification. The ILS-S contains shipment status
         indicating the shipping activity has released the item(s) to a carrier for shipment.
         Shipment status is provided to the ILS-S using shipment status (AS*) transactions.
         See Para 5.2.90 for AS* transaction format and processing instructions.
         5.2.95.2.2. MILSTAMP transit time expired. Normal MILSTAMP transit time has
         expired or undue delay has occurred. Transit times for various shipments expire
         based upon a combination of the requisition priority and required delivery date
         (RDD). Once shipment transit time has expired, tracer action is automatically
         initiated through the next processing of the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
         program as follows:
             5.2.95.2.2.1. Mission capable (MICAP) required delivery date (RDD). Mission
             Capable (MICAP) requirements are identified by priority 01-08 requisitions
             assigned an RDD of 999, N**, or E**. Tracer action is initiated between 7 and
             14 days for CONUS, and between 14 and 21 days for OCONUS MICAP
             shipments.
             5.2.95.2.2.2. Non-MICAP RDD. Non-MICAP requirements are identified by
             priority 01-08 requisitions assigned an RDD of 555/777, or priority 1-15
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               565


            requisition with an assigned RDD of 444. Tracer action is initiated between 20
            and 30 days for CONUS, and between 30 and 40 days for OCONUS non-MICAP
            shipments.
            5.2.95.2.2.3. Blank RDD. Shipments containing a blank RDD indicate routine
            transportation is applicable. Tracer action is initiated between 30 and 60 days for
            CONUS, and between 60 and 90 days for OCONUS shipments.
     5.2.95.3. Transportation Tracer Flag (TTF) Assignment. The TTF is assigned to ILS-S
     shipment status details when shipment status is provided by the LRS/transportation
     activity. Transportation tracer flags are automatically assigned and used to identify
     overdue or lost shipments. Overdue or lost shipments are based on MILSTAMP
     standards using the priority designator and RDD. Additionally, TTF assignment is based
     upon the mode of shipment or transportation method used. Requisitions (shipments) are
     traced when government transportation or mail channels are used. Note: If requisition
     (shipment) tracing is required, the transportation tracer flag determines which portion of
     the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation Listing the overdue or lost shipment appears on.
     5.2.95.4. MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation Program (NGV597). The MILSTAMP
     Tracer Reconciliation program provides various output products and transportation action
     required (TAR) transactions. The specific output product and TAR image is based upon
     the transportation tracer flag (TTF) assigned to the status detail. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
     Pt 2, Ch 6 for more information concerning the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
     program. Additionally, see the following paragraphs and AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B,
     Order and Requisitioning for the various listings, processes, TAR transactions, and tracer
     actions required with each portion of the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation listing. The
     MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation Listing is produced in five parts as follows:
        5.2.95.4.1. Transportation tracer listing (TTF Equals T). The Transportation Tracer
        Listing identifies delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) that were shipped through
        government transportation channels. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
        Requisitioning for more information and processing procedures for the transportation
        tracer listing.
        5.2.95.4.2. Parcel post tracer listing (TTF Equals P). The Parcel Post Tracer Listing
        identifies delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) that were shipped by various mail
        methods. For example, overdue shipments using Parcel Post, Military Ordinary Mail
        (MOM), and Express mail methods are contained on this portion of the list. See
        AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning for more information and
        processing procedures for the Parcel Post Tracer Listing. Initial parcel post tracing
        efforts are provided in the form of Request for Registered, Insured, and Certified
        Shipment Tracing (AFT) transactions. The AFT transaction provides the date
        shipped, shipment control number, and mode of shipment designators. See Para
        5.2.96 for more information concerning AFT transaction format and processing
        instructions.
        5.2.95.4.3. Receipt acknowledged error listing (TTF equals A). The Receipt
        Acknowledged Error Listing identifies delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) that
        were previously identified as received by Cargo Movement; however, not received in
        the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
566                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         Requisitioning for more information and processing procedures for the receipt
         acknowledged error listing.
         5.2.95.4.4. Consolidated shipment error listing (TTF Equals L). The Consolidated
         Shipment Error Listing identifies delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) that were
         shipped as part of a consolidated shipment. Consolidated shipments are identified by
         a lead transportation control number (TCN). The TCN serves as a shipment control
         number from shipment release to shipment receipt. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B,
         Order and Requisitioning for more information and processing procedures for the
         Consolidated Shipment Error Listing. Additionally, the consolidated shipment error
         listing produces Consolidated Shipment Inquiry (1CS) transactions that allow
         verification of items contained in consolidated shipments. See Para 5.2.97 for format
         and processing information concerning the consolidated shipment inquiry (1CS)
         transaction.
         5.2.95.4.5. Exception action listing (TTF Equals F). The Exception Action Listing
         identifies delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) that were identified as previously
         being traced by Cargo Movement on previous listings. See for more information and
         processing procedures for the Exception Action Listing. Additionally, overseas bases
         are provided the Exception Action Listing to identify delayed or lost requisitions
         (shipments) through the use of transportation follow-up (TM1) transactions. See
         Para 5.2.98 for format and processing procedures for overseas transportation follow-
         up (TM1) transactions. Overseas follow-up (TM1) transactions will be replied to
         with tracer action reply (TMA) transactions. TMA transactions provide overseas
         bases replies to shipment follow-up transactions, and provide date shipped, day
         received, mode of shipment, etc. See Para 5.2.99 for format and processing
         instructions for overseas tracer action reply (TMA) transactions.
      5.2.95.5. Tracer action required (TAR) transaction processing.           Processing the
      MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation program will produce listings and TAR inputs based
      upon the transportation tracer flag (TTF) in the shipment status detail. The TAR
      transactions are used for a variety of purposes. First, TAR transactions are used to
      initiate tracer action, and update transportation tracer flags on shipment status details.
      After initial identification and set up of TTFs, TAR transactions are used to delete
      erroneous shipment status details, or provide internal controls to allow for subsequent
      receipt processing. See Para 5.2.100 for format and processing instructions for TAR
      transactions. Note:         At the option of the LRS/Materiel Management Activity
      management personnel, may prepare all supporting documentation (CTH, receipts,
      management notices), process all TAR transactions, and freeze item records with special
      inventory notification (1GP) transactions prior to sending all TAR documentation to the
      Inventory section for adjustment processing.
         5.2.95.5.1. Shipped-short receipt. Specific TAR transactions are processed if
         delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) are never received. Processing of a TAR
         input transaction will create a short-shipped receipt and delete the due-in detail.
         However, the corresponding shipment status detail will not be deleted. Ultimately,
         TAR shipped-short receipt processing changes the shipment status detail
         supplementary address field to TARREC. This TARREC designation identifies TAR
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 567


        shipped-short receipt processing, but allows the ILS-S to process subsequent receipts
        without a corresponding due-in detail.
        5.2.95.5.2. Subsequent receipt. Most delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) items
        are eventually received. However, during receipt processing, if the ILS-S finds a
        shipment status detail supplementary address field containing TARREC, but the due-
        in detail is not loaded, the ILS-S will allow receipt processing without producing a
        356 Reject (due-in detail not loaded). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more
        information concerning 356 Rejects. Subsequent receipt action for delayed or lost
        requisitions will cause the ILS-S to automatically delete the shipment status detail if
        the total requisition quantity has been received. However, if only a partial requisition
        quantity is received, the shipment status detail will not be deleted until the entire
        quantity is received or considered lost.
     5.2.95.6. Shipment Loss Analysis (M16). The M16 report lists shipment status details
     updated during TAR processing and provides statistical data by source of supply and
     mode code. Additionally, ILS-S shipment status details assigned TARREC used in
     metric compilation for the Shipment Loss Analysis (M16) report. The M16 report
     segregates delayed or lost requisitions (shipments) into potential losses, actual losses, or
     recovered shipments. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more information
     concerning the M16 report. The listing is divided into three parts as follows:
        5.2.95.6.1. Part one potential losses. Part One of the M16 report lists shipment status
        details that contain TARREC, and a TAR processing date of 120 days or less from the
        current date. The shipments appearing on Part One have not been physically
        received, but have the potential for receipt within the next four months.
        5.2.95.6.2. Part two actual losses. Part Two of the M16 report lists shipment status
        details that contain TARREC, and a TAR processing date greater than 120 days from
        the current date. The shipments appearing on Part Two have not been received, and
        are considered actual losses to the ILS-S. After 120 days, shipment status details are
        automatically deleted.
        5.2.95.6.3. Part three recovered shipments. Part Three of the M16 report lists
        shipment status details that contain TARREC, but have been physically received
        within 120 days of TAR transaction processing. The shipments appearing on Part
        Three have been physically received and considered recovered shipments.
     5.2.95.7. Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process (SF 364). The Report of
     Discrepancy/Supply Discrepancy Report (ROD/SDR), SF 364, is filed by receiving
     activities to record item or packaging discrepancies attributable to the shipping activity
     (see DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17. SDRs are prepared for nonreceipt of lost or misplaced
     requisitions (shipments) after the Traffic Management Office confirms non-receipt of lost
     or misplaced requisitions (shipments). Use the ES-S SDR function or the DoD Web-
     SDR system as the primary means to submit SDRs and SF 364 when the ES-S SDR
     function or the DoD Web-SDR system is not available. The SDR serves two purposes:
        5.2.95.7.1. Notifies shipping organization. The SDR notifies the responsible
        shipping activity, such as a contractor, manufacturer, or vendor that, a discrepancy
 568                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


           exists. The SDR aids in analyzing and correcting discrepancies, as well as in
           preventing recurrences.
           5.2.95.7.2. Aids inventory accounting. The SDR is used as a supporting document
           for inventory accounting and financial adjustments. A copy of the completed report

Notes:
1. TAR Action Codes. Action codes are assigned as follows:
a. Action Code A. Action Code A sets the transportation tracer flag (TTF) on the
shipment status detail to an A. When program NGV597 is processed again, shipment
status details containing TTF of A will appear on the Receipt Acknowledged Error
Listing. These shipments have been received by Cargo Movement, but not in
LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Additional actions are required to determine
shipment location. OUTPUT: None.
b. Action Code B. Action Code B indicates Transportation (Cargo Movement
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               573


Tracing) is tracing the lost shipment. Once requisitions are being traced by Cargo
Movement, the ILS-S will move an M to the transportation tracer flag on the
shipment status detail. The TAR program will change the M to an F when the next
TAR program is processed 30 days later. This will cause the shipment status detail to
appear on the Exception Action List. OUTPUT: For overseas bases tracing
shipments through transportation channels, a follow-up (TM1) transaction is
produced. See Para 5.2.99 for TM1 transaction format and processing instructions.
c. Action Code C. Action Code C prevents a shipment status detail from appearing
on the Report of Discrepancy (NGV587) program. TAR transactions with action
code C are used to update claims receivable (CR) and billed-not-received (BNR)
details to indicate a supply deficiency report (SDR) was prepared and submitted. The
TAR transaction containing action code C must be processed using screen #198.
Note: To process TAR C transactions correctly, you must first process a TAR with
an asterisk (*). The asterisk only applies to shortages. Otherwise, a 112 Reject will
be produced. For claims payable (CP) details, a P will be assigned in position 60.
See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 112 Rejects.
OUTPUT: None.
d. Action Code D. Action Code D deletes erroneous shipment status details. The
AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity and LRS/Materiel Management Activity
personnel will use TAR “D” processing to correct erroneous ship details when
required. For example; status that has been processed after partial receipt of materiel.
OUTPUT: None.
e. Action Code F. Action Code F is used to manually update SDR follow-up
processing. OUTPUT: None.
f. Action Code R. Action Code R is used to manually update SDR reply processing.
OUTPUT: None
g. Action Code T. Action Code T produces a request for shipment tracing for
controlled parcel post shipments marked NO RECORD on the Parcel Post Tracer
List. OUTPUT: Request for Registered, Insured, and Certified Parcel Post shipment
tracing (AFT) transaction. See Para 5.2.97 for format and processing instructions
for the AFT transaction.
h. Action Code Asterisk (*). Action Code asterisk (*) deletes due-in details and
changes the supplementary address field of the shipment status detail to TARREC.
Note: If the shipment status detail (211) DT-AV-SHPT equals REC, the shipment
status detail cannot be deleted. Reject notice 001 applies. OUTPUT: Creates a
short-shipped receipt and produces an I306 management notice. Additionally, an
F080 MGT notice (Discrepancy Report Required) will be produced when the dollar
criteria in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M are met. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
additional information concerning reject and management notices.
2. Required when action code is T.
574                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


3. Required when action code is “C, F, R, T or asterisk (*)”.
4. Pay Receipt Flag. The Pay Receipt Flag is used to when claims payable (CP) or
claims receivable (CR) details exist. Enter P for claims payable and leave blank for
claims receivable details.
5. Type TAR Code. The Type TAR Code is used only on the TAR1 screen.
6. Screen ID Code. The Screen ID Code is used only on the TAR1 and TAR2
screens.
7. If the due-in is being pushed from another base, enter the DODAAC/SRAN of the
base that is shipping the assets.


  5.2.101. Customer Backorder Review, Validation, and Cancellation.
      5.2.101.1. Maintenance Due Out Status Notification (1SH) Transaction.
         5.2.101.1.1. Due-Out Status Notification (1SH) Conditions. The ILS-S creates a
         due-out status notification (1SH) transaction for spares required to repair aircraft
         (commodity code K) and Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS)
         TCTO/time-change items when tracking procedures are implemented, according to
         the supported organization. Creation of the 1SH transaction is produced as a result of
         customer backorder (due-out) establishment, due-out release, due-out cancellation,
         significant status changes (Table 5.112), or the backorder mark-for field (SRD and/or
         equipment serial number) is changed.
         5.2.101.1.2. Items Excluded from Automated Tracking. Technical order compliance
         (TOC) kits and ILS-S due-out detail records containing activity code B, E, S, U, and
         W are excluded from automated tracking procedures.
         5.2.101.1.3. Partial Due-Out Release. When the computer makes a partial due-out
         release for items tracked by Maintenance, the due-out release program creates a 1SH
         output that contains the quantity issued.
         5.2.101.1.4. Due-Out Cancellations. At the end of the day, the ILS-S creates due-out
         cancellation (DOC) transactions as required. See Para. 5.2.104 for maintenance due-
         out cancellation (DOC) transaction format and processing instructions. Additionally,
         the ILS-S produces due-out cancellation transactions during the periodic
         reconciliation between IMDS CDB and the ILS-S. LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity personnel must process DOC input transactions received from the base
         Maintenance on a timely basis to make ensure Maintenance and Supply records
         remain coordinated. Note: The LRS/accountable officer and Chief of Maintenance
         will develop local procedures to ensure due-out cancellation transactions and
         associated output is processed daily.
         5.2.101.1.5. Maintenance Organization Due-Outs. The ILS-S currently supports
         three maintenance programs: IMDS CDB (G105); CAMS-FM (G081); and the
         REMIS (G099) Reporting System. Each due-out supporting these systems will be
         identified by a due-out maintenance code on the ILS-S due-out detail record. For
         example, due-out maintenance code M identifies IMDS CDB. Due-out maintenance
         code G identifies G081. Lastly, due-out maintenance code N identifies non-
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 575


          maintenance organizations. Note: Any other data in the due-out IMDS CDB flag
          field on the due-out detail record is invalid.
   5.2.102. Due-Out Status Notification (1SH) Transaction Format.
      5.2.102.1. Purpose. To provide the transaction format and processing instructions for the
      maintenance due-out status notification (1SH) transaction. The 1SH transaction is input
      when a maintenance due-out is changed, cancelled, released, or a change of status occurs.

   5.2.103. Customer Backorder Due-Out Cancellation (DOC) Transaction.
       5.2.103.1. Purpose. To explain processing procedures and transaction format for the
       customer backorder due-out cancellation (DOC) transaction.
       5.2.103.2. General.     The using organization may request backorder (due-out)
       cancellation action. Supply may begin the due-out cancellation process if an item cannot
       be supplied. LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel should coordinate with
       AFMC SCM-R Activities to determine if the backorder can be satisfied prior to
       processing DOC. If cancelled, use the appropriate status/cancellation codes described in
       Para. 5.2.7 Notify the customer that cancellation of the backorder has occurred. Note:
       Stock Control personnel advise the EAE of all backorder cancellation requests for
       equipment items.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              577


     5.2.103.3. Repair Cycle Item Backorder Cancellation. When a backorder contains a
     corresponding due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM) detail record (other than credit DIFM),
     special procedures must be used to ensure repair cycle information is properly updated in
     the ILS-S. When the serviceable item has not been issued and a memo DIFM detail
     record exists, the net-repair cycle days field must be updated (positions 62-64) when the
     backorder is cancelled.
        5.2.103.3.1. Automatic Net Repair Cycle Days Calculation. When a backorder
        contains a corresponding DIFM detail and the current quarter repair cycle time equals
        the new quarter repair cycle time, the DOC transaction is processed with blanks in
        positions 62-64. The repair cycle days will be computed by the ILS-S.
        5.2.103.3.2. Manual Repair Cycle Days Computation. If the repair cycle record
        quarterly repair cycle times are blank, LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel
        enter the net repair cycle days in positions 62-64 of the DOC input transaction. The
        net repair cycle days are calculated by multiplying the quantity backordered times the
        number of repair (DIFM) days. Note: The number of repair days divided by the
        quantity backordered cannot be less than 1 or greater than 29. The ILS-S does not
        update the repair cycle record when maintenance action taken code equals B, J, V, or
        X on the DOC transaction input.
     5.2.103.4. Credit DIFM Detail Exists. Customer backorders that contain corresponding
     credit DIFM detail records identify existing holes or shortages in end-items.
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel enter TEX 2 in position 51 of the DOC
     input transaction when canceling a customer backorder that contains a corresponding
     credit DIFM detail. If TEX 2 is not used, a 466 reject (Credit DIFM Detail Exists –
     Verify Due-Out Cancellation) will be produced.
     5.2.103.5. AWP End-Item Shipped/Condemned. If a decision is made to evacuate or
     condemn an AWP end-item, the bit and piece backorders will be cancelled or transferred
     to another AWP end-item. If cancelled, enter action taken code (ATC) B in position 44
     and TEX 9 in position 51. This will ensure cumulative recurring demands are not
     reduced. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure, for more information.
     5.2.103.6. MICAP Backorder Cancellation. If a MICAP customer backorder is
     cancelled, a MICAP stop (B9M) report transaction will be produced with delete code 9.
     Para. 5.2.26 for MICAP delete and advice codes. When a due-in linked to a MICAP
     customer backorder is canceled, a MICAP stop transaction is produced and delete code
     zero (0) assigned. If the MICAP requirement must be requisitioned again, process a
     special requisition (SPR) transaction using a new requisition number. See Para 5.2.54
     for more information concerning SPR transaction processing. Note: Once a new
     requisition number has been assigned, a new MICAP start (B9M) transaction will be
     produced.

Notes:
1. This field is developed locally using any combination of alpha/numeric characters. It may
include the activity/organization/individual desk number, etc., initiating the cancellation.
Input the source code--a base option upon input of the due-out cancellation.
2. Enter a zero (0) if the input is for a MICAP due-out and meets the conditions outlined in
Para 5.2.26.
3. The serviceable maintenance action taken code is mandatory on due-out cancellation for
due-outs under DIFM control. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure for demand
data update logic. Use action taken code B for a due-out cancellation resulting from the end-
item being shipped NRTS.
4. If requesting partial cancellation, this field must contain the cancellation quantity (see note
5).
5. The following information applies:
a. If cumulative recurring demands are not to be decreased, use TEX code 9.
b. If the credit DIFM detail is to be deleted, use TEX code 2.
c. If canceling the total detail quantity, use TEX 5 (positions 45-49 must be blank).
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  579


6. The following information applies:
a. If the cancellation justification code is ZC, leave this field blank. It will be automatically
written to the transaction history record by the DOC transaction program.
b. If the code is not ZC, enter the cancellation justification code.
7. Code must be I or M. I indicates Stock Control has processed the DOC input transaction.
M indicates that IMDS CDB created the DOC input transaction.
8. Positions 62-64 will normally be blank (see this chapter for exceptions). If the ERRCD is
XD/XF, then the activity code is J, X, R or C, and the maintenance action taken code is B, J, or
X. The repair cycle record will not be updated.
9. When an I is entered in position 66 of the DOC transaction, an automatic FCI transaction
interface occurs to adjust the in-use authorized quantity. If the DOC quantity equals the total
authorized quantity, the in-use detail is deleted. See Para. 5.4.4. for more information
concerning FCI transaction processing.
10. Upon input of a DOC transaction, positions 67-80 are available for local use.
11. Not a required entry when processed from a supply terminal. The IMDS CDB originating
terminal ID is assigned by the ILS-S when processing a DOC transaction from an IMDS CDB
terminal.

           5.2.105. Canceling Customer Backorders & Process For Granting Credit.
               5.2.105.1. Purpose. To explain the backorder cancellation process in the ILS-S and to
               list the rules used to determine if credit is granted to supply customers.
               5.2.105.2. Factors Used for Granting Credit. The ILS-S uses a variety of factors to
               determine if credit is granted to the supply customer. Those factors include: budget
               code, obligated due-out, un-obligated due-out, current fiscal year versus prior fiscal year,
               assets position, and ERRCD.

the government is to be penalized (see Defense Acquisition Regulation).
7. This field is used as locally desired to control containers (quantity of empty containers,
quantity being used, and quantity full and their location) when updating the vendor-owned
container detail record. The information entered in this field is carried over to the G detail
record for control purposes. For example, the data in these fields may be:
5W010EW12FW (F = full, E = empty, O = organization, W = warehouse). For additional
control, organization code(s) may be entered in the optional data field of the G detail when
processing the 1VR (change) input. When changing this field, Storage and Issue personnel
must re-enter the information on the detail record, as well as any new information, since
this field will over write the old field.
   5.3.2. Warehouse Location Load/Change/ Delete (FCS) Input Transactions.
       5.3.2.1. Purpose. To explain the processing procedures and transaction format for a

Notes:
         1          Force Code (position 7). The force code can be a blank or F.
                    a. A blank in position 7 places the bin location only on the input
                    stock number and document number.
                    b. When an F is placed in position 7, this allows the bin location
                    to be placed on all details for that document number. (A stock
                    number is not required when using this option.)
         2          DLA storage flag (position 24). If DLA storage flag is to be
                    loaded to the item record, enter a “Y” in position 24. An “*” in
                    position 24 will delete the DLA storage flag.
         3          Warehouse Location (positions 31-41). When loading or changing
                    the warehouse location record that is assigned to an item record,
                    enter the appropriate data as outlined in this table. If an equipment
                    detail document number is entered in positions 57-70, then the
                    eight-position warehouse location must start in position 31.
         4          The system designator (positions 55-56) may not be blank. Only
                    the item record specified by the input stock number and system
                    designator will be updated. If the input is from a satellite terminal,
                    the input system designator must be compatible with the terminal
                    number in the base constants record.
         5          Detail document number (positions 57-70) will be used for all
                    details (for example: readiness spares package (RSP), in-place
584                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


                  readiness spares package (IRSP), mobility readiness spares
                  package (MRSP), equipment, and unserviceable type details). A
                  warehouse location code will be assigned for Deficiency Report
                  exhibit items located in Maintenance.
      6           Bin Label Request Flag (position 71). If the input requests a
                  replacement bin label for serviceable assets, enter R. Positions 31-
                  41 must be blank when this option is used. (This option is not
                  available for unserviceable assets.)
      7           Warehouse Location Delete Flag (position 72).
                  a. If the warehouse location record is to be deleted from the item
                  record, enter an asterisk (*) in position 72. An 032 reject will
                  occur if the item record has the following:
                  (1) A serviceable balance.
                  (2) A due-in from maintenance (DIFM), due-in, war reserve
                  material (WRM) spares, or supply point detail record.
                  b. Enter Z in position 72 if the warehouse location record is to be
                  deleted, even though details are related to the item record. The
                  item record serviceable balance MUST BE ZERO. This process is
                  especially valuable for those activities having limited storage
                  locations to assign.
                  c. Detail warehouse locations will be deleted by using delete code
                  Z and the detail balance is zero. (Unserviceable detail locations
                  are deleted when the detail balance is zero.)
                  d. DO NOT enter the Warehouse Location in pos. 31-41 when
                  deleting a warehouse location. Entering a location causes D14 to
                  count deletion as a location change.
  5.3.3. Conducting the Warehouse Storage Location Validation/FCS Review. The FCS
  review process takes place only during on-line processing. Screens 1WL/426 and 2WL/427
  are used to display unmatched FCS images one at a time.
      5.3.3.1. Process Codes. The program requests a review process code with each FCS
      image/2WL screen so the operator can tell program NGV408 what to do with each FCS
      image. Warehouse personnel can tab to and change data as needed.
          5.3.3.1.1. Process Code P. When process code P is entered, the program passes the
          FCS image to program NGV405 for on-line processing and deletes it from the
          location validation file. Process code P must be used when requesting a bin label or
          deleting a warehouse location.
          5.3.3.1.2. Process Code D. Process code D will cause the program to delete the FCS
          image from the location-validation file.
          5.3.3.1.3. No Process Code. If no review process code is entered, the program
          retains the FCS image in the location validation file for further research.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  585


        5.3.3.2. Displays Images. The program displays each FCS image in the location
        validation file one at a time until all FCS images in the file have been reviewed. Once
        the program encounters the end-of-file sentinel, it terminates processing.
        5.3.3.3. Terminating the Review Process. The operator can terminate the review any
        time by entering END in the 2WL screen's Warehouse Location data field.
        5.3.3.4. Restarting the Review Program. To review FCS images still remaining in the
        file, restart the program by reentering the 1WL to have FCS images output one at a time
        in 2WL screen format.
   5.3.4. Supply Point Detail Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry (FSP).
        5.3.4.1. Purpose.      The Forward Supply Point (FSP) transaction             is used to
        load/change/delete supply point detail records to account for items authorized to be pre-
        positioned for maintenance support at either on-base or off-base locations. Specific
        entries will result in automatic processing of an issue request for the required quantity.
        FSP is used to load/change/delete warehouse locations on the Supply Point detail. FSP
        can also be used to inquiry supply point detail records.
        5.3.4.2. Input Restrictions. None.
           5.3.4.2.1. Requirements: FSP transactions are entered through RPS/main system or
           any terminal using screen FSP/131.

Notes:
         1       Action Code (position 4):
                 a. L is used for load. FSP inputs can be used to load either authorized or
                 substitute detail records. Authorized details are identified by a numeric
                 authorized quantity and substitutes by a blank authorized quantity field.
                 Substitute details are also created by the issue and due-out release programs if
                 necessary when an interchangeable item identified in an interchangeable and
                 substitute group (ISG) is transferred to the supply point.
                 b. C is used for changes. Inputs to change the type authorization code can
                 only be made against the authorized detail record. Any change made to the
                 type authorization code on the authorized detail will also be made to all
                 applicable substitutes by program control. Changes to the supplementary
                 application data fields will be made individually against the applicable
                 substitute or authorized detail record.
                 c. D is used for deletes. Authorized or substitute detail records can be deleted
                 by FSP inputs. In either case, the on-hand quantity must be zero. Authorized
                 details cannot be deleted if any substitute or due-out details are loaded for that
                 document number. Substitute details will also be deleted by the turn-in
                 program if the on-hand quantity is zero and the authorized quantity and
                 authorization directive and requirements code and supplementary application
                 data fields are all blank. No entries are required in positions 50-79 for
                 deletes.
                 d. I is used to inquiry a SUPPLY-POINT-DETAIL-RECORD. Only the
                 stock number, system designator, and FSP document number is required on
                 the input.
         2       No internal edits are made on this field. Any data entered on load or change
                 inputs will be stored on the detail record. On change inputs, an asterisk (*) in
                 the last position of this field will cause the field on the detail record to be
                 blanked.
         3       Position 17 is ignored on load and delete inputs. Position 17 must be blank
                 on change in authorization quantity inputs. Enter a P in position 17 to change
                 a substitute detail to a prime detail.
         4       All supply points are identified by organization code 005 and any appropriate
                 alpha/numeric shop code. The shop code is used to identify a specific supply
                 point. The document number of the detail (positions 36-49) must have an S
                 activity code, 005 organization code, alphanumeric shop code, four numeric
                 zeros in the date portion, and a four-digit numeric serial number other than
                 zeros. If an authorized detail is being loaded, the input document number
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                             587


            cannot be equal to any detail already loaded. If a substitute detail is being
            loaded, an authorized prime detail must be loaded with the same document
            number.
            Note: Four numeric zeros will be stored in the date portion of the document
            number of the detail record regardless of what may be in the input.
     5      Ship to stock record account number (SRAN) (positions 50-55). If type
            authorization code (position 69) equals D, a valid SRAN must be entered or a
            R147 REJ notice (SD/S Not Loaded In Base-Supply-MGMT-DC) will be
            output. Using a SRAN in conjunction with type authorization code D will
            cause requisitions for supply point details to have the SRAN automatically
            perpetuated into the supplementary address field of the requisition. This will
            result in the item being shipped directly to the requesting activity. Leave
            blank when loading substitute details. Inputs to change the direct ship SRAN
            must be processed against the authorized detail record.
     6      Authorized quantity (positions 64-68):
            a. ON LOADS, the authorized quantity must contain all numeric characters
            (may be all zeros) if an authorized detail is being loaded. The authorized
            quantity field must be blank in all positions if a substitute detail is being
            loaded.
            b. ON CHANGES, leave blank if no change is to be made on the detail
            record. If the authorized quantity is to be changed, enter the desired quantity
            in this field. If any assets are on hand when decreasing a supply point
            authorization the supply point monitor will prepare a turn-in (with action
            taken code T) using AF Form 2005. The property and turn-in document will
            be delivered to Flight Service Center for further action (see AFMAN 23-122,
            Sec 6B, Returns for the TIN format).
            Note: When adding or changing a supply point detail record, the total
            authorized quantity of all supply point and mission support kit detail records
            will be combined and compared to the requisition objective (RO) (see
            AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure). If the combined authorized
            quantity exceeds the RO, a 632 REJ notice (Input QTY Plus SUP PT and
            MSK Auth QTY Exceeds the RO) will be produced. Either the RO must be
            increased by adding a special level, or the supply point authorized quantity
            must be decreased.
     7      Type authorization code (position 69): Must contain a valid type
            authorization code (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2) when loading an
            authorized detail. Leave blank when loading substitute details. Inputs to

                established and maintained as locally determined by each supply point. Enter
                whatever location is meaningful to the user; that is, LAUNCH for launch kits
                or PROP for prop shop, etc. There are no edits performed on this field. To
                blank the storage location, leave this field blank. If the storage location is the
                only field being changed, ensure all fields with the exception of the
                transaction identifier code (TRIC), Stock Number, Action Code, Document
                Number, and System Designator are blank or the input will not process.
                The storage location is printed on issue (ISU), DOR, and MSI outputs to
                facilitate the location of assets within supply points.

Notes:
1. Normally leave blank on new loads. When present, it must be numeric greater than zero.
If economic order quantity (EOQ) detail records are in the computer, their cumulative
recurring demands are added to the input. The EOQ consumption detail records will then
be deleted.
2. Master bench stock detail cannot be loaded to adjunct stock numbers (dash numbers
other than -1 numbers).
3. Enter applicable system designator.
4. Enter authorized bench stock quantity. This field must be numeric greater than zero.
(This is the quantity that will be used by the 1BS input as the quantity of issue.) Do not
decrease authorizations to generate multiple issues.
5. Enter the three-digit numeric organization code of the customer (see AFH 23-123, Vol
1, Ch 2). If a consolidated organization code is loaded on the organization cost center
record (OCCR) for the input organization, the IT supply system will alter the input
organization code.
6. Enter two-position alpha/numeric shop code of the customer (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1,
Ch 2).
7. Enter four zeros. If an economic order quantity (EOQ) consumption detail record is in
the database with the same organization and shop code, the date of last demand (DOLD)
from that detail will be assigned by the IT supply system. Otherwise the current Julian
date will be assigned.
8. Enter an unused item number. (Field is edited for numeric greater than zero). An item
number beginning with 0001 for each shop code will be assigned externally for all items as
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     591


they are established. When an item is deleted from bench stock, the appropriate
Organization Bench Stock Listing will be adjusted accordingly. When an item is added to
an established bench stock, the Organization Bench Stock Listing will be checked, and the
first sequential item number will be used whenever possible.
9. Enter storage location or leave blank. This entry shows the actual storage location of the
item in the bench stock area and is not edited for any particular format. This field may
identify any location system desired. For example, A10 could refer to level A in the
horizontal bin row and 10 in vertical bin row. A maximum of six positions will be printed
on the BSU output.
10. Enter cost data or work order number in the format outlined below if the type
organization code is A, B, D, or V; otherwise leave blank.
If the organization is type A or B, positions 44-49 must contain a civil engineer work order
number- -for example, A01234 or B05046.
If the organization is type D (maintenance industrial fund)
Position 44--alpha (A, C, M, S, T, or U)/numeric.
Positions 45-48--numeric.
Position 49--alpha (blank if position 44 is U).
Position 50--alpha or blank.
If the organization is type V, a vehicle maintenance work order number must be present in
positions 44-48, and a charge code must be present in position 49 if the organization
operates under the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS)
11. Enter the applicable code. Authorized entries are 1, 2, 3, 4, A, B, C, D, or blank. If
blank, an EOQ consumption detail with at least three demands must be on file with the
input organizational shop code.
12. Enter minimum reserve authorization (MRA)/maximum authorization quantity (MAQ)
quantities or leave blank. Edits are as follows:
a. If position 51 is C or D, positions 52-54 must be blank (when MRA is assigned, the
current detail record MRA/MAQ quantity will be blanked under by the IT supply system).
b. If position 51 is 1, 3, or A, positions 52-54 must be numeric greater than zero (the
master bench stock detail record MRA/MAQ quantity must be equal to or less than the
detail authorized quantity).
c. If position 51 is 2, 4, or B, positions 52-54 must be numeric greater than zero (the master
bench stock detail record MRA/MAQ quantity must be equal to or greater than the detail
authorized quantity).
13. Normally blank on new loads. If left blank, the current Julian date will be assigned. If
not blank, a valid Julian date must be entered.
14. Enter I for automatic interface, O to override the dollar threshold, B to do both, or
blank to ignore.
15. Must be 5 or blank. TEX code 5 is used to override reasonable quantity and extended
cost edits.

16. If the type organization code which appears in the OCCR is equal to G, I, V, 7, 8, or 9,
then a valid SRD contained in the standard equate designator record must be entered in this
field. If the type organization code is other than G, I, V, 7, 8, or 9 in the OCCR, this field
may be blank. However, if an SRD is entered, it must be contained in the standard equate
designator record.
17. Enter miscellaneous data as desired by local management, or leave blank.

   5.3.14. Processing Organizational Refusals.
       5.3.14.1. These are actions necessary to process organizational refusals.
       5.3.14.2. Determining the Cause for Refusals. Upon receipt of an item and applicable
       ISU/DOR document annotated with ORGANIZATIONAL REFUSAL, Inspection
       personnel must determine the primary responsibility for the refusal. Inspection personnel
       will consider the reason for refusal stated on the ISU/MSI/DOR document and an
       inspection of the item when making this determination. For example, Supply is
       responsible if the property is misidentified, unserviceable, unsuitable substitute, or the
       quantity issued is in excess of what the customer ordered. However, the customer is
       responsible if the wrong item was ordered, or if the item was shipped due to a failure to
       cancel a due-out. Take the appropriate action(s) based on responsibility and ERRCD as
       indicated in Table 5.129

  NOTE                 Refusals Requiring Turn-Ins. When an organizational refusal
                       requires a turn-in, the inspector either stamps or signs the
                       organizational refusal document and annotates the appropriate turn-
                       in document number. For retail outlet IEE items, the IEE (instead
                       of the inspector) signs the document.

            5.3.14.3. Reestablish the Requirement. Inspection personnel will coordinate with the
            organization that refused the property to determine if they still have a valid requirement.
            If a valid requirement still exists, Inspection personnel will coordinate with the applicable
            demand processing to reestablish the issue/due-out for the correct assets.
            5.3.14.4. Asset tracking system processing. If used, Inspection personnel will update the
            asset tracking system to reflect the document was an Organizational Refusal. After all
            required actions are completed, Inspection personnel will move the original asset tracking
            system ID to the delivery history area using the Move 1348-1A to History option on the
            Delivery Menu or update the delivery history if the document has already been delivered.

4. Process change to prime detail only. This field is based on the change-to use code. For
change-to use code A, the field must be numeric (mobility increment number). Enter an asterisk
(*) in position 11 to blank code presently on record. For change-to use code B, C, or D, the field
can be alpha/numeric.
5. If the code on the organization cost center record is to be used for the ISU, leave blank.
6. This is used to identify the desk number of the initiator or left blank.
7. Process change to prime detail only. Enter applicable code of BASS items or leave blank.
8. Enter stock number of the authorized/in-use detail record to be changed. This field of the
record cannot be changed with this input. To add a prime stock number in an existing document
number set, ensure the item record is loaded and create an input with the new stock number,
system designator, existing document number, and a 4 in position 124.
9. Enter system designator of the authorized/in-use detail record to be changed. This field of the
record cannot be changed with this input.
10. Enter the document number of the authorized/in-use detail record to be changed. This field of
the record cannot be changed with this input.
11. Process change to prime detail only. Enter new authorized quantity. The authorized quantity
cannot be zeros unless the ASC is changed to 000.
12. The following information applies:
a. The item code on substitute details may be changed among M, S, or U.
b. A substitute detail may be changed to a prime. The program will realign the old prime as a
substitute if an on-hand quantity exists. The authorized quantity is the only other change allowed
on this input.
13. The following information applies:
a. If you want to delete all codes except H, L, P, R, or U, enter an asterisk (*).
b. Note: Codes D and Q may not be deleted from substitute details.
c. If you want to enter H, L, P, or U.
d. If no change is required leave blank.
14. Process change to prime detail only.
a. If you make a change other than A to B, and B to A, you must also change the allowance ID.

b. If you change B to A, you must have data in positions 10 and 11.
15. Process change to prime detail only.
a. If you want to use code B details, the field is 3 numerics and 4 alphas.
b. If you want additional program edits, see load input.
c. If you are changing use code C records, the WRM ASC cannot be entered.
16. Process change to prime detail only. Enter the applicable code.
a. If no change is required, leave blank.
b. If you want to delete code presently on detail, enter an asterisk (*) in position 68.
17. Process to prime detail only.
a. If you want to effect change, enter applicable code.
b. If you want no change, leave blank.
c. If you want to delete, enter an asterisk (*) in position 71.
18. ISU/DOR Flag:
a. To call the ISU program, enter ‘I’.
b. To create a DOR, enter ‘D’.
c. To increase the authorized quantity without calling ISU or DOR, enter ‘N’.
19. This entry is necessary only on increase of authorization. Enter the Project Code in positions
73-75; UJC in positions 76-77. Note: If invalid entries are made, the FCI will process without
the ISU program being called.
20. Process change to prime detail only.
a. If you want to delete the code presently assigned, enter an asterisk (*).
b. If bin labels are not required, enter N.
21. These fields apply to use codes A, C, and D. However data may be entered on any detail.
When an input field is left blank, the program will enter Z(s) in the corresponding field of the
detail. No edits are performed on these input fields.
22. The CEMO provides this information.
23. When the increase/decrease code is blank, this field is ignored. An “I” in the
increase/decrease field causes the on-hand quantity field to decrease by the quantity entered in this
field and the unserviceable calibration quantity field to increase. A “D” in the increase/decrease
field causes the unserviceable calibration quantity field to decrease and the on-hand quantity field
to increase for the input stock number and document number. When the increase/decrease fields
are used, the unserviceable quantity fields are the only data fields updated by this input. If the
increase/decrease indicator is used, a numeric value greater than zero must be entered into one of
the unserviceable quantity fields or the input reject.
24. Same as note 23 except that the unserviceable maintenance quantity field is adjusted.
25. Normally this is a 1. If adding a new stock number as a prime item in an existing document
number set, then enter a 4 (see note 8).
26. Enter the applicable Civil Engineer cost report data (work order number, facility number, and
job order number). These fields apply only to Civil Engineer organizations.

               5.4.16.1. Perform quality control on the output received from the input to the SBSS
               terminal or on the output returned from AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity if
               the SBSS terminal unavailable. Make corrections, if necessary.
                   5.4.16.1.1. If the output is correct, take the following steps:
                   5.4.16.1.2. Obtain the Inspector's signature on the FER document.
                   5.4.16.1.3. Obtain the signature of the approving official (if it is required on the FER
                   document.
                   5.4.16.1.4. Ensure, if applicable, that the serial number of the item is entered on the
                   FER document.
                   5.4.16.1.5. Forward copy 1 of the FER document, DD 1348-1A, to Document
                   Control.
                   5.4.16.1.6. Forward copy 2 of the FER document to the custodian.

                   5.4.16.1.8. File copy 3 with EAEs copy of custodian's R14 if the reidentified item is
                   a serial number weapon or an EAID weapon. Otherwise, destroy copy 3 with
                   remaining copies of the FER document or use copy 3 and remaining copies as
                   desired.
            5.4.17. EM File Maintenance: EAID In-Use Identity Change (FER) Input.
               5.4.17.1. Purpose. To reidentify an equipment item that has been misidentified while it
               was being used. The FER program will create a substitute detail (item code "S") with the
               FER input action quantity as the new quantity on hand. The "change-from" stock number
               detail will remain as the prime (item code "P") with a quantity on hand of zero. If
               external review determines the "change-to" stock number is or can be used for
               authorization, then complete the transaction by processing an FCIC (Para 5.4.6) to
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  629


       change the authorized quantity and item code on the "change-to" stock number. This will
       delete the "change-from" stock number detail.
       5.4.17.2. Input Restrictions. Pseudo or any terminal based on system designator and

Notes:
1. If the change-to authorized/in-use detail record is not in the SBSS database, it will be added
under program control unless other conditions will cause a reject.
2. The following information applies:
a. If the ASC on the change-from record is 000, 000A, or 048 and if only a portion of the in-use
quantity needs reidentification, enter in positions 70-73 the next available item number (the last
four positions of the detail document number) for the applicable custodian’s account. Note: If
you enter the next available number under any condition other than listed above, the program will
ignore it and the input will process normally.

      Note:
      1. The following information applies:
      a. If selection of authorized in-use detail records is based upon the
      organization code, enter all numbers for the organization code. There must
      be an organization cost center record loaded that is equal to this code.
      b. If selection is not based upon the organization code, leave this field
      blank.
      2. The following information applies:
      a. If selection is based upon the shop code, enter the shop code. Also enter
      the organization code in positions 7-9, since selection is not made by shop
      code alone.
      b. If selection is not based upon the shop code, leave this field blank.
      3. The following information applies:
      a. If selecting records for a specific use code, enter A, B, C, or D. Also
      enter the allowance identification. Note: Do not enter the use code unless
      the input organization and shop codes are blank.
      b. If a use code is not needed for selection, leave this field blank.
      4. The following information applies:
      a. If the allowance identification is used for selection, enter this field. Use
      allowance ID as follows:
      (1) The first three positions must be numbers or blanks. The first three
      positions can be blank only if the use code is D (WRM equipment). Note:
      Do not use commas in the first three positions or the input will reject.
      (2) The last four positions can be numbers, letters, blanks, or commas. All
      except the commas are used as selection factors. If you enter a comma in
      one or more of these positions, the program will ignore that character of the
      allowance ID as a selection factor. You may use four commas. A comma is
      the only special character that can be entered in these four positions;
      otherwise, the input will reject.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                         635


     (3) Allowance ID cannot be used for selection unless the change-from
     organization and shop codes are blank.
     (4) If selecting on WRM report code, this field cannot be blank.
     b. If allowance ID is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
     5. The following information applies:
     a. If selection is by the organization code only, enter the change-to
     organization code. This code must be a number and equal to an organization
     code that is loaded. The input will reject if the change-to organization code
     is blank or equal to the change-from organization code.
     b. If selection is by both organization and shop codes, the change-to
     organization and shop codes must be entered. The change-from organization
     or shop code must be different from the change-to code. The change-to
     organization code must be numeric and the applicable organization cost
     center record must be loaded.
     6. The following information applies:
     a. If selection is by shop code, enter the change-to shop code. The change-
     to code can be equal to the change-from code if the change-to and change-
     from organization codes are different. Either the change-to organization
     code or the change-to shop code must be different from the change-from
     code.
     b. If selection is not by shop code, leave this field blank.
     7. The following information applies:
     a. Use codes A, B, and C can only be changed to A or B. If the change-
     from use code is D, the change-to code must be D.
     b. If this field does not apply, leave it blank.
     8. The following information applies:
     a. If the allowance ID is used for selection, enter this field.
     (1) The first three positions can be any combination of numbers, blanks, or
     commas. Note: Do not use alpha characters in the first three positions.
     (2) The last four positions can be any combination of letters, numbers,
     blanks, or commas. Any position of the change-to allowance ID that
     contains a comma will cause the character in that position of the allowance
     ID on the selected authorized-in-use detail record to be carried forward to
     the same position of the allowance ID on the output FCI. Any input position
     that does not contain a comma will cause that position from the input to be
     carried forward into the output FCI. Note: Do not use any special
     characters other than commas.
     b. If the allowance ID is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
     9. The following information applies:
     a. If debit and credit transfer (issue and turn-in) documents are not desired
636                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      when the FCI cards are input, enter an S in this field. The S will be carried
      forward into the output FCI.
      b. If debit and credit transfer documents are desired, leave this field blank.
      The blank will be carried forward into the output FCI.
      c. Note: If this field is anything other than S or blank, the input will be
      rejected.
      10. The following information applies:
      a. If selection is desired by both the organization and shop codes, this field
      will contain a beginning control number. (Position 78 must be blank.)
      (1) Enter a four-digit number greater than zero. This number will be the
      next available control number that can be assigned to an authorized-in-use
      detail record for the change-to shop code. The last four positions of the
      change-to document number in the output FCIs will begin with this number
      and run consecutively. Exception: If an authorized in-use detail record is
      already loaded for the gaining custodian (same stock number, system
      designator, use code, WRM-reporting application code, BASS composition,
      base of planned use, alternate storage location, equipment code, end item
      identification code, UTC, increment code/number, and allowance ID), the
      losing detail will be consolidated with the gaining detail record. The output
      FCI will contain the document number of the gaining detail in the change-to
      document number field.
      (2) All FCIs will be output with a complete change-to document number
      when selection depends upon the shop code.
      b. If the organization and shop codes are not used for selection, leave this
      field blank.
      11. The following information applies:
      a. If you use the organization code without the shop code for selection, use
      M (merge) or R (retain) in this field. If position 78 contains anything other
      than M or R, or if position 78 is blank, the input will be rejected.
      (1) Enter M, and leave positions 74-77 blank, if you believe that the change-
      to organization code has existing authorized-in-use detail records and the
      change-from organization code will merge with that organization. If the
      computer finds an authorized-in-use detail to be merged with the losing
      detail, the FCI will be output with the complete document number of the
      gaining detail that the losing detail can be merged with. If no gaining detail
      is found that can be merged with the losing detail, the gaining detail serial
      number portion will be blank on the output FCI image.
      (2) Enter an R if it is desired to retain the losing detail serial number. If no
      details are found for merging, the losing detail serial number will be entered
      into the gaining document number of the output FCI.

     b. If the organization code is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
     12. System designator is a mandatory entry.
     13. If you want the FCI images to be loaded to the pseudo for processing,
     enter a P. Leaving this position blank will create a file with the file name of
     GV555UD900. The qualifier will be the same as the qualifier for the print
     file. This file may be reviewed and/or edited prior to loading to pseudo for
     processing. If this position equals a P and the program is being processed on
     the secondary gang, ensure the primary gang is up.
     14. Process change to prime detail only. This field is based on the change-
     to use code. For change-to use code A, the field must be numeric (mobility
     increment number). For change to use code B or D, the field can be
     alpha/numeric.

1. The following information applies:
a. Leave blank for EAID assets.
2. The following information applies:
a. Enter the U, M, N, or T that will be assigned to the gaining authorized/in-use detail record. Do
not use this input to change a prime authorized/in-use detail record item code.
b. If this field is blank, the FET will process normally.
c. If this field is invalid, an S will be assigned automatically.

3. The following information applies:
a. If the item is a vehicle, enter its vehicle registration number. Refer to AFI 24-302.
b. If the item is not a vehicle, leave this field blank.
4. If this field is blank, issue priority 12 will be assigned to output DD 1348-1A.
5. Leave blank when transfer of all details with the same document number is desired.
6. Enter the document number of the authorized/in-use detail record from which the item is being
transferred.
7. Enter the quantity of the item being transferred. This number should be 5 digits greater than
00000 but not more than the in-use quantity on the losing detail record. If the item is a vehicle,
then the action quantity is 00001.
8. Enter the document number of the authorized/in-use detail record to which the item is being
transferred.
a. When the transfer satisfies a due-out, the due-out or transferred quantity may be canceled by
entering the due-out document number date in the date field of the gaining document number.
b. When an in-use detail record is not loaded for this document number and input stock number,
the FET program will establish a substitute detail record (except ASCs 000, 048, 985, and 987) if
a prime is loaded.
9. The following information applies:
a. If it is necessary to decrease the authorized quantity on the losing detail record, enter this field.
Note: The quantity in this field must be five digits and will be subtracted from the authorized
quantity on the prime record of the losing document number. The quantity entered in this field
cannot exceed the input action quantity or the authorized quantity on the losing record. The
quantity in this field is NOT the figure that you will enter on the prime detail record. EXAMPLE:
If someone is authorized ten chairs but needs only eight, enter the difference, 00002, in this field.
(1) The input may be under a substitute or prime stock number. The prime record will be located
internally and adjusted when necessary.
(2) The prime and substitute detail records will be deleted if three conditions exist together: if the
authorized quantity is reduced to zero, if no in-use quantity remains on the prime or substitute
detail records, and if no due-out detail records are in the DBRA. Note: The authorized quantity
cannot be reduced to zero if any in-use or due-out quantities remain. This condition will result in
a 246 REJ notice (Auth QTY Cannot Be Reduced to Zero With O/H, Subs, or D/O). See AFH 23-
123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for additional information.
(3) You may use the decrease quantity field with the increase authorized quantity (see Note 9), by
itself or not at all. If you use both the decrease and increase fields, they do not have to be equal to
each other.
b. If no action is required on the authorized quantity of the losing detail record, leave this field
blank or enter all zeros.
10. The following information applies:
a. If the authorized quantity on the gaining authorized/in-use detail is to be increased, enter this
field.
      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    641


      (1) The quantity in this field will be added to the authorized quantity on the prime detail record of
      the gaining document number. EXCEPTION: The authorized quantity on a record with a 000
      ASC will never be increased above zero. Note: The figure in this field cannot exceed the input
      action quantity. EXAMPLE: If someone is authorized ten chairs but needs fourteen, enter the
      difference, 00004, in this field.
      (2) You can use this field when the decrease authorized quantity (see Note 8) is used. You can
      also use this field by itself or not at all. If you use both the decrease and increase authorized
      quantity, they do not have to be equal to each other.
      b. If no action is required on the authorized quantity of the gaining authorized/in-use detail record,
      leave this field blank.
      11. If an item is being transferred to the LRS/CC or Accountable Officer-holding account, enter
      an H in position 79.
      12. If you want the words Degraded Operations printed on the issue and turn-in documents, enter
      a 6. The program will ignore any other entry.

                               database table (AST_INUSE_DB) without a base
                               authorization in either the RQMT_CUR_DB (use
                               code A or B) or RQMT_WRM_DB (use code C or
                               D) database tables.
                               Corrective Action: Check AFEMS reject suspense
                               (AREJ) and clear all rejects for XGJs with the same
                               org/shop code and in-use detail document number
                               prior to resubmitting this XGJ or clearing the reject
                               suspense.
                               a. If the material condition code is blank, then clear
                               the reject suspense by entering an “X” in the “AC”

                               with an X -- you must use a D next to the transaction
                               image on the AREJ screen as specified in Note 3.
                               3. XSD. An attempt was made to change or delete a
                               due-in and the requisition number/SRAN is not found

AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  689


                                    a. If the FMC is D and the due-in and due-out
                                    document numbers are no longer loaded in the SBSS,
                                    clear the AFEMS reject suspense by entering a “D”
                                    in the “AC” field next to the transaction image on the
                                    AREJ screen according to Note 1.
                                    b. If the FMC is D and the due-out still exist in the
                                    SBSS, then clear all previous AFEMS rejects for
                                    XSDs with the same due-out document number.
                                    Resubmit this XSD according by entering an “R” in
                                    the “AC” field next to the transaction image on the
                                    AREJ screen according to Note 6 after clearing all
                                    previous XSD rejects with the same due-out
                                    document number.
                                    c. If the FMC is C and the due-in and/or due-out still
                                    exist within the SBSS, then clear all previous rejects
                                    for XSDs with the same due-in and/or due-out
                                    document number. Resubmit the XSD by entering an
                                    “R” in the “AC” field next to the transaction image
                                    on the AREJ screen after clearing all previous rejects.
     5.4.33.2. A cumulative reject suspense file of all SBSS rejects and variances is
     maintained in AFEMS (C001). Use the AFEMS on-line transaction SBSS on-line reject
     (AREJ) screen to view and/or clear rejects/variances in the suspense file.         Notes:
     1. Enter an Action Code “D” next to the transaction image to delete the suspense. Enter
     an Action Code “X” next to the transaction image to delete the suspense and in the case
     of DOC IDs XGJ, XGF, XGG, or XGL to generate an XJE interrogation to the SBSS.
     Refer to Note 3 if the FMC is a D for any of these DOC IDs or the supply condition code
     in the XGJ is not blank.     2. To report rejected transactions to AFEMS when reverse
     post action is not appropriate or authorized utilize TRIC 2HQ (screen 133). Enter the
     original transaction from the AFEMS reject suspense file, correct the erroneous data,
     change the transaction date to the current date, and clear the suspense within AFEMS by
     entering a “D” next to transaction image. This procedure is only for those transactions
     which cannot be resubmitted via the AREJ screen within AFEMS utilizing Action Code
     “R” (see Note 6).        3. Use the 2HQ as described in Note 2 to report: XGJ, XGF,
     XGG, or XGL transactions when the FMC is “D” or the supply condition code is not
     blank on the XGJ. Clear the suspense within AFEMS by placing an Action Code “X”
     next to the transaction image on the transaction day following processing of the 2HQ.
     4. Contact AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity (DSN 596-5771) if the D24
     or the on-line equipment transaction reporting programs are outputting invalid data.   5.
     MATRIX of reason codes. All transactions must be type account code “E” and EMC 4
     or 5.      6. The following AFEMS (C001) DOC IDs can be corrected and retransmitted
     or resubmitted within AFEMS by using Action Code “R” next to the transaction image
     on the AREJ screen: XS2, XGH, XGI, XJU, XSA, XSB, XSC, XSD, XSK, BL0, and
     B7A. Corrective action should be initiated within the SBSS, as applicable, prior to
 690                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        resubmittal of the listed DOC IDs within AFEMS. The invalid data on the transaction
        image must be corrected prior on the AREJ screen prior to resubmittal to AFEMS.
        7. Reject transactions with transaction edit codes AC, BD, DA, RB, and RE will not be
        displayed on the AREJ screen within AFEMS. They will be displayed one time on the
        daily CORRPT report available in OUTPUT PRODUCTS and should be reviewed for
        corrective action within the SBSS. Once corrective action is taken with inputs to the
        SBSS the appropriate output will be sent to AFEMS.
   5.4.34. Equipment Shortage (XSA).
        5.4.34.1. Purpose. To report base-funded equipment (budget code 9/Z) memo due-outs

shipping document serial number in positions 4-7, shipping document date in positions 37-40, and
the losing SRAN in positions 69-74. These fields are combined to form a shipping document
number. For manually prepared FEDs, the shipping document number is required. The shipping
document number must be the same as that used by the deploying base to ensure that intransit files
within the AFEMS (C001) are properly updated.
2. The FED program will edit compatibility between the A&F interface code, allowance
identification, use code, equipment code, action code, and shipping document number upon input.
See Table 5.205 for input data.
3. FED outputs produced by FME processing will contain the detail document number specified
by FME input parameters. The date field will be the date the FME was processed. For manually
prepared FEDs, enter the document number of the authorized/in-use detail record to be
established. Entries in the date field will be as outlined in note 1.
4. The authorized quantity field must be blank for anything other than primary items, (item code
‘P’), when creating a new detail or 001 REJ notice will occur. When a quantity is input to this
field, it will be added to the authorized quantity on the detail.
5. The following information applies:
a. If data are not applicable, leave blank.
b. If input base of planned use and alternate storage location codes are other than blank, and equal
to each other, input will generate a 001 REJ notice.
6. If positions 54-56 are 158, 900, 907, 908, or 911 (BASS/MOSS), enter the composition code in
positions 61-64, (1 alpha, 3 numeric), otherwise, enter the base of planned use and alternate
storage location code, if applicable, or leave blank.
7. Enter EAID. The code assigns FIA code 020 under program control.
8. This code corresponds to the documentation code that was used in FME processing.

   5.4.67. AF Form 601 Preparation.
       5.4.67.1. Purpose. To request and direct all equipment allowance changes. It is also
       used for the following additional purposes when approval above wing/base level is
       required.
       5.4.67.2. Uses of AF Form 601.
            5.4.67.2.1. Prepare and submit the AF Form 601 to request the following:
               5.4.67.2.1.1. A change to an allowance standard.
               5.4.67.2.1.2. An item in the allowance standard where the approval level is above
               wing/base level.
               5.4.67.2.1.3. An item which requires approval under miscellaneous ASCs
               (excludes 987).
736                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.4.67.2.1.4. All fixed ground communications-electronics equipment end items.
      5.4.67.3. Transmittal Information.
         5.4.67.3.1. You may forward the AF Form 601 to the addresses shown in the TO and
         FROM blocks without a letter of transmittal. To save time, use the AF Form 601 as a
         cover sheet for listings or other source documents when the same action is required
         for multiple items. This will eliminate transcribing data from another source to the
         AF Form 601. When listings or source documents are attached to the AF Form 601,
         be sure that the attachments contain complete data for processing. The EAE or
         AFMC Allowance Standard Activity will only forward AF Forms 601 to activities
         above wing/base level for those items noted. The EAE or AFMC Allowance
         Standard Activity will input all AF Forms 601 received from the equipment
         custodians into the AFEMS (C001) using the Data Transaction Sessions allowance
         change request (TACR) screen if the approval is above wing/base level. DO NOT
         INCLUDE classified information in requests input into the AFEMS (C001).
         5.4.67.3.2. One AF Form 601 for multiple items.
         5.4.67.3.3. Different federal supply classes. When the request is against the same
         ASC and when background and justification are the same for all items, you may
         include multiple items with different FSC on a single AF Form 601 requiring higher
         than base-level approval. These requests will not be input into the AFEMS (C001).
         5.4.67.3.4. CEMO-directed actions. For CEMO-directed actions, you may include
         multiple ASC and FSC items on a single AF Form 601 if all items are approved at the
         same level. These requests will not be input into the AFEMS (C001).
         5.4.67.3.5. Individual AF Forms 601 for multiple items. Submit individual AF
         Forms 601 requests for items which require individual justification, which are not
         project-related, or which require stock listing action. These requests will be input
         into the AFEMS (C001) if approval is above wing/base level.
      5.4.67.4. Preparation of AF Form 601.
         5.4.67.4.1. When you prepare AF Form 601, use the instructions on the reverse side
         of the form. The information in this attachment explains those instructions in detail.
         DO NOT use AF Forms 601a and 601b.
         5.4.67.4.2. TO. Enter the military address of the office that reviews, coordinates, and
         processes the form. If necessary, you may use the reviewing authority comments
         block for local coordination so that there are TO/FROM blocks for Base Supply and
         CEMO coordination.
         5.4.67.4.3. signature. Unless otherwise directed by this volume or the allowance
         standard, the signature in the block will be that of the LRS/CC or Accountable
         Officer at base level and the CEMO or Director of Supply at command level. Do not
         use the signatures of directors or executive officers, etc., of other AF activities.
         5.4.67.4.4. action taken. These blocks remain blank when the following occurs:
             5.4.67.4.4.1. Returned with no action taken. The request is returned without
             action for additional justification or another appropriate reason.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 737


             5.4.67.4.4.2. Approved and returned. The request is being returned from the final
             approving agency down through channels, back to the originator. EXAMPLE:
             The MAJCOM approves and forwards it to the depot; the depot approves and
             returns it to the command. The command does not need to approve it again to
             forward it back down.
         5.4.67.4.5. signature of organization commander. The commander’s signature is not
         required to be sent to the AFMC Allowance Standard Activity.
         5.4.67.4.6. national stock number or part number. If the stock number or part
         number are not available for the requested item, then include a complete description
         of the item in the justification block.
         5.4.67.4.7. allowance identification. If the request is not based on an allowance
         standard, enter the special ASC, for example, 041, 048, etc.
         5.4.67.4.8. justification and item description.
             5.4.67.4.8.1. Purpose. The justification must prove the basis of issue included in
             the allowance standard or ASC cited. Enter the following information as part of
             the justification: use, applicable end item, weapon system, aircraft, level of
             maintenance, technical order, etc. If you have increased the quantity, explain
             why the current in-use quantity will not meet your needs.                  NOTE:
             Supply/review organizations will use the rest of the form.
             5.4.67.4.8.2. Special instructions.
             5.4.67.4.8.3. Fixed ground C-E items. All requests for fixed ground C-E
             (allowance standard 654) must include the coordination of the Base
             Communications Plans and Programs Office and the number of the approved
             requirement document (IT/NSSRD or PMD).
             5.4.67.4.8.4. Bin labels. Custodians must indicate if bin labels are or are not
             required.
             5.4.67.4.8.5. All requests for COMSEC must contain the coordination of the base
             COMSEC custodian as well as the Base Communications Plans and Programs
             Office.
         5.4.67.4.9. Reviewing authority comments. AFMC Allowance Standard Activity
         personnel and/or the reviewing activity will enter comments to explain the action
         taken and/or describe the additional information required. If local management has
         set up standard statements for this purpose, personnel may use the printed list of these
         statements.

nonclassified BSU issues with an extended price of $999.99 or less. All other issues require the signature
of the organizational Bench Stock Custodian.
11. When the original quantity is circled and a new quantity entered, check the transaction quantity to be
sure a shipped-short or over-receipt transaction was processed.
12. If a shortage or overage meets the criteria for reporting, the document must have an SF 364, Report of
Discrepancy attached. If the receipt is on an I306 MGT notice output from processing then the
inspector’s, in-checker’s and warehouse personnel’s signatures or stamps are not required.
13. Inspection will check shelf life items it receives to be sure the test and expiration information is
accurate. The inspector or the receiving inchecker must sign or stamp the receiving document for shelf life

must be signed by the Chief, Materiel Management Flight or designated representative.
17. On FCH and FCC documents only, block 27 must contain the reason for the FCH or FCC. (If
more space is needed, the reverse side may be used.) On FCH documents, the certifying official
and the approving official will sign in blocks 26 and 27. Certifying and approving officials’ signatures are
not required for munitions supply accounts (FK). The munitions inspector’s signature or stamp and
supporting inspection documentation (for example, AFTO Form 102) will satisfy the certification and
approval requirement. For warehouse change documents, the signature or stamp of the individual making
the inspection, when requested by storage personnel, is also required.
18. At the option of the LRS CC/AO, FCC transactions involving the warranted tools program, may be
processed by Base Service Store personnel. When the LRS CC/AO elects this option, Base Service Store
personnel will sign the FCC in lieu of inspection personnel.
19. For COMSEC equipment items, the equipment custodian must sign or initial all documents. For
COMSEC supply point items, the supply point monitor must sign or initial all documents. The following
exceptions to this procedure may occur, but note 2 applies regardless of the option
used:
- When off-base organizations pick up COMSEC items from the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, the
organization representative may sign for the items. A letter designating the authorized representative and
signed by the organization commander must be on file in Document Control at the point where the items
are picked up.
- When LRS/transportation activity channels are used, note 5 applies.
20. For Civil Engineer bulk items delivered to dispersed job sites: Delivery tickets and call register, signed
by the person that received the property, will be attached to the Document Control copy of-the manual
receipt. The manual issue documents, cross-referenced to the receipt document, do not require signature.
The inspector’s stamp is not required on the receipt document.
21. For Automated Warehouse System users, process using FCH/FCC.
22. If the quantity differs, check the next and prior transactions to see if two transactions were generated.
 AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   743


If two transactions were generated, then only the single source document should be filed.
23. Bases that use SF 44, Purchase-Invoice-Voucher, for on-the-spot, over-the-counter purchase of
materiel may recognize the signature on the SF 44 as proof of receipt. The SF 44 will be attached to an
ISU or DOR.
24. At the option of the LRS CC/AO, Document Control will not return non-fileable documents to the
generating activity for quality edits (such as, selected-by and date).
25. If an item is NWRM, the person receiving the property must be authorized in writing to receipt for the
item. Document Control will immediately notify the LRS CC/AO and the unit Security Manager when an
improper signature is identified. The LRS CC/AO and Security Manager will determine which collateral
organizations to notify and process their decisions according to DoD 5200.1/AFI 31-401. File the results
of the investigation with the document. The words "Classified NWRM-Item" must be stamped or hand-
scribed in red ink on all source document copies.
     5.5.2. Delinquent Source Document Update.
        5.5.2.1. Purpose. To retrieve, add, change, or delete DSD records on the SBLC database.
        5.5.2.2. Program Logic. In updating delinquent source documents, Program NGV784,
        Delinquent Source Document Update, does the following:
        5.5.2.3. Edits the TRIC inputs 1DS and 1DU transactions for validity.
        5.5.2.4. Retrieves delinquent source document records using the document number in the
        1DS input.
        5.5.2.5. Builds 1DU output screen from data on the DSD record. If more than one record
        is located for the input document number, the program formats and writes the output to
        the Paging File.
        5.5.2.6. Adds DSD records to the database when the action code is A.
        5.5.2.7. Changes or deletes DSD records on the database using the 1DU input with
        action code C or D.
        5.5.2.8. Paging File. Paging provides a reserved storage area on the SBLC for each
        terminal, an area which each terminal can use for storage and retrieval of CTH online
        process. Paging allows you to view the data stored in these areas.        Note: A paging
        file area is assigned to each terminal and is unique to that terminal. It can only be
        accessed from the terminal on which it was created. The paging file area is associated
        with the functional identification number, not with the user identification number. There
        is NOT a master paging file. Each record written to the Paging File represents a data
        page. Data pages can accumulate in the Paging File until the user deletes the file. The
        program automatically writes multiple records for one document number into this file.
        Users may call in paging, check the file status, review the data in paging, and then exit or
        delete paging.
        5.5.2.9. Paging File Access. When accessing the Paging File, enter PAG and press
        <ENTER>. Any time the Paging File is entered, page 1 of the Paging File displays.
        Formats other than the Delinquent Source Document Update images might well be in the
        file since the program adds pages as it creates them. If your output is only one page and
744                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      the Paging File is empty, your output appears as page 1 of the Paging File. If the page
      needed is not page 1, users must scan the file to find the applicable pages.
      5.5.2.10. File Scanning. There are three ways for users to reach the desired page once
      they are in the Paging File. They can do the following:
      5.5.2.11. Move forward page-by-page in the Paging File by pressing the F1 function key.
      5.5.2.12. Move backward page-by-page by pressing the F2 function key.
      5.5.2.13. Move directly to the desired page by entering the page number into the status
      line and pressing <ENTER>.
      5.5.2.14. Status Line. Each time a new page displays, the Paging File status line appears
      at the bottom of the screen and contains the following:
      5.5.2.15. Index Page Count. The IPC always shows zero. This status does not apply to
      the SBSS.
      5.5.2.16. Data Page Count. The DPC shows the total number of pages in the Paging File.
      5.5.2.17. Current Page Number. The CPN shows the page number of the displayed page.
      The CPN is always 1 when the user enters the Paging File.
      5.5.2.18. Start-of-Entry Symbol. The start-of-entry symbol (>) on the status line allows
      the user to enter the required page number and press <ENTER> to locate the required
      page.
      5.5.2.19. Exit Command. The exit command (EX) lets the user exit the paging file and
      keeps the record/input image displayed on the screen for further action. The exit
      command does not delete the records from the Paging File; it simply exits the paging
      program leaving the current record displayed for further action. Exiting allows records to
      accumulate in the Paging File; only the delete command deletes records. WARNING: Be
      sure you do not press <ENTER> after exiting paging UNLESS the displayed information
      is an input, for example, a reverse-post.
      5.5.2.20. Status Command. The status command (ST) is responsible for displaying the
      IPC, DPC, and CPN. Currently, the status command is program controlled.
      5.5.2.21. Delete Command. The delete command (DEL) lets the user exit the Paging File
      and deletes all the information in the file, leaving the current record displayed for further
      action. Note: Never use delete until you have completed all processing.
  5.5.3. Processing TRIC 1DS. The document number is the only mandatory entry when
  processing TRIC 1DS. However, enter any data available to help identify the delinquent
  source document. The only purpose of this input is to locate and retrieve a delinquent source
  document record. Users enter TRIC 1DS or #410 to call in the DELINQUENT SOURCE
  DOCUMENT INQUIRY screen and make the applicable entries.

      5.5.3.1. No Record Located. If there is no record loaded, the Delinquent Source
      Document Update, screen 1DU: /411, displays. The user can either exit the program or
      enter a delinquent source document.
      5.5.3.2. Record Located. If a record is located for the input document number, the
      Delinquent Source Document Update, screen 1DU:/ 411, displays with the data elements
      from the record on the screen. After exiting paging with the record displayed, users can
      change any element screened (except the document number), delete the record, or exit the
      1DU program.
      5.5.3.3. Multiple Records Located. When TRIC 1DS locates multiple records with the
      same document number, the program writes each record to the Paging File as TRIC 1DU
      record/input images. The Paging File lets users scan the records written there; but, they
      CANNOT change or delete delinquent source document records while in the Paging File.
      Users must exit the Paging File using the DEL option of paging and leaving the record
      displayed. Then, make changes or deletions, enter the applicable action code, and
      transmit. To clear additional DSDs, repeat the 1DS/1DU process.
      5.5.3.4. Reviewing 1DU Images. Once the input is located, the user reviews the
      delinquent source document record images. Upon completing your review, take the
      action to delete (DEL) or exit (EX) the terminal paging program.
      5.5.3.5. Deleting the Paging File. Move the cursor to the delete command and press
      <ENTER>. The delete command (DEL) deletes all the records in the Paging File, leaving
      the current record displayed for further action. For example, if you queried the delinquent
      source document file then processed a reverse-post, both the 1D records and the reverse-
      post records would be in the Paging File. Deleting one page or one record would delete
      ALL the pages or records. Be sure you complete all processing before you delete. We
      recommend that you delete the Paging File after you complete a process. For example,
      complete the DSD update then delete the file.
      5.5.3.6. Exiting the Paging File. Move the cursor to the exit command and press
      <ENTER>. The displayed information is now active. Users may now print the contents of
      a screen or take any available screened option.
      5.5.3.7. Printing a Delinquent Source Document Screen. To print the contents of a screen
      produced from a delinquent source document inquiry transaction, press the PRINT key
      (or SHIFT and PRINT key together) to force print the screened information. If a screen

       print of more pages or records is needed, access the Paging File, locate the page, and
       print. After printing the last item, cursor to DEL, and transmit.
   5.5.4. Processing TRIC 1DU. If loading a new record, process the Delinquent Source
   Document Inquiry (TRIC 1DS) request. When the blank Delinquent Source Document
   Update input screen (TRIC 1DU or #411) displays, enter all applicable data.

  5.5.6. ES-S Management System Document Control Procedures.
     5.5.6.1. Overview.
        5.5.6.1.1. Section Summary. This section provides Document Control procedures for
        bases that have ES-S Management System installed. This section also provides
        instructions on how to identify and correct mismatches between ES-S Management
        System and SBSS, and how to work the Delinquent Document Listing (R59) in ES-S
        Management System.
     5.5.6.2. Document Control Process.
        5.5.6.2.1. ES-S Management System uses Smart card technology to provide
        electronic signature and filing for the following auditable SBSS documents: ISU,
        MSI, A5J, SHP, A2(x), A4(x), DOR and BSU. ES-S Management System also sends
        a 1SI transaction to the SBSS that clears the document control record. For receipt and
        turn-in transactions if the ES-S Management System flag is on and the REC or TIN
        is processed on function 803, a document control record is not created. On BSU
        documents the 1SI is sent to the SBSS when the document is pulled not when it is
        delivered.
     5.5.6.3. There are instances when the 1SI transaction rejects in the SBSS and the
     document control record is not cleared. When this occurs, the document will appear on
     the R59 if not cleared.
        5.5.6.3.1. In order to prevent documents from appearing on the R59 due to a 1SI
        reject, it is necessary to check ES-S Management System for 1SI rejects daily. 1SI
        rejects do not appear on the SBSS reject listing and must be reviewed in ES-S
        Management System . It is recommended that a reject report is produced daily
        selecting TRIC 1SI for the current day and one day prior.
        5.5.6.3.2. There are four possible rejects for a 1SI transaction, which are 643, 644,
        645, and 799. A 643 and 799 reject require action, the other two rejects are
        informational only. To clear a 799 reject, the user must go to Delivery History and
        review the document that caused the 1SI reject and re-send the 1SI. The 799 reject is
        normally the result of the CTH area being down when the 1SI attempted to process.
        See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for clearing 643 rejects.
     5.5.6.4. If ES-S Management System is used to create Degraded Operations documents,
     accomplish the following procedures to ensure that all transactions are posted and
     Delinquent Source Documents (DSDs) are cleared.
        5.5.6.4.1. Produce the ES-S Management System Created Not Delivered and ES-S
        Management System Created Deliveries Reports to verify that all Degraded
        Operations deliveries created in ES-S Management System have been processed.
        5.5.6.4.2. After Degraded Operations transaction have been processed in the SBSS,
        the transaction serial number must be updated in ES-S Management System using
        the Update Delivery History option, then send the 1Sitransaction to clear the DCC
        image in the SBSS.
     5.5.6.5. The Process R59 Delinquent Documents function allows a user to import the
     R59 print listing into ES-S Management System . Once the file is imported into ES-S
750                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      Management System, the user can produce a listing that reflects information about the
      documents on the R59.
         5.5.6.5.1. To import the R59, the R59 print file must be placed in the directory on the
         ES-S Management System server that is designated as the Update Files Location in
         the System Parameter menu.
         5.5.6.5.2. Once the R59 print listing has been placed in the correct directory on the
         server, select the Process R59 Delinquent Documents option from the Maintenance
         Menu, then enter the filename of the R59 print file and depress the process button.
         5.5.6.5.3. ES-S Management System will check the Delivery History table for each
         document on the R59 as it is imported and if the document number is found and it has
         been delivered to a customer a 1SI transaction will be formatted and sent to the SBSS
         to clear the DCC. The Delinquent Documents report will show if a 1SI was sent.
  5.5.7. Asset Management Document Control Procedures.
      5.5.7.1. This section provides a link to Document Control procedures for bases that use
      Asset Management. Reference Enterprise System-Supply (ES-S) User’s Manual Ch 31 –
      Asset           Management              at        the         following           link:
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-LG-
      IL-ES-13&Filter=OO-LG-IL-ES&tsi=1313472430017
  5.5.8. Delinquent TRIC Record Update (NGV786).
      5.5.8.1. Purpose. To load, change, delete or list delinquent TRIC records. The delinquent
      TRIC records contain the transaction identification code and the applicable delinquent
      and pre-delinquent day criteria. This record is used to determine delinquency.
      5.5.8.2. Program Logic. Program NGV786, Delinquent TRIC Record Update (TRIC
      1DQ, screen #412), performs the following functions:
         5.5.8.2.1. Edits the input 1DQ transaction for validity.
         5.5.8.2.2. Loads, changes, deletes, or lists the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC records
         based on the input action code.
             5.5.8.2.2.1. If the input action code equals A, the program reads the CT-
             DELINQUENTSOURCE record. If a record exists, an error message displays. If a
             record does not exist, the program stores the record on the database.
             5.5.8.2.2.2. If the input action code equals C or D, the program reads the CT-
             DELINQUENTSOURCE record. If no record is located, an error message
             displays. If there is a record located, the program updates or deletes the record on
             the database.
  5.5.9. Processing TRIC 1DQ. Users can add, change or delete from one to 20 records with
  one input screen. If more than 20 records require updating, repeat the process. An error
  message displays identifying those TRICs not loaded, changed, or deleted. All other TRICs,
  not in error, will process. Users enter TRIC 1DQ or #412 to call in the DELINQUENT
  DOCUMENT TRIC UPDATE screen and make the applicable entries.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     751


Figure 5.17. Delinquent Document TRIC Update Screen.




      5.5.9.1. Enter the TRIC code of the record to add, change or delete. Each TRIC code
      entered represents a single record. The user may enter delinquent criteria for a range of
      TRICs by entering an asterisk (*) in the third position of the TRIC field (that is, use FE*
      for all TRICs FEC, FED, FER, FET and FEX.)
      5.5.9.2. Enter the number of days (01-99) before a document with the designated TRIC
      will become delinquent or pre-delinquent. The Delinquent Document Listing
      (R59/NGV781) program uses this number in determining whether a record appears on the
      delinquent or pre-delinquent list.
      5.5.9.3. Enter action code A to load a record. Press <ENTER> to load the TRIC. If the
      TRIC is on the database file, an error message TRIC ALREADY EXISTS ON FILE
      displays. If the current database information is correct, no further action is required. If the
      information as it is stored on the database is incorrect, delete the current information and
      re-input the correct information.
      5.5.9.4. Enter action code C to change a record. Press <ENTER> to enter the change.
      You cannot change TRIC codes; but, you can change the delinquent or pre-delinquent
      criteria. If no TRIC is located, an error message NO TRIC RECORD ON FILE displays.
      When this appears, decide if the record must be added to the database. If it is to be added,
      use the add procedures in the above paragraph to load a new record.
      752                                                         AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.5.9.5. Enter action code D to delete a record. Press <ENTER>. If no record is located,
             an error message TRIC NOT ON FILE displays and no further action is required. Delete
             all records containing invalid TRIC codes.
             5.5.9.6. Enter action code L to list the records. Press <ENTER>.
                  5.5.9.6.1. If no records are located, an error message TRICS NOT ON FILE or FILE
                  NOT LOADED displays. If the file is not loaded, reload the database file by
                  reprocessing a load of all previously loaded TRIC information using the load
                  procedures.
                  5.5.9.6.2. If records are located, they are written to the Paging File in screen format,
                  and the first sixteen TRIC codes display. Each sixteen records represents one data
                  page in the Paging File. Users can scan the Paging File to see which TRICs are listed
                  and to determine if additions, changes, or deletions are needed.                   Note:
                  Remember, users cannot make any changes while in the Paging File. They must exit
                  the Paging File and make the changes using the SBLC screen.
                  5.5.9.6.3. Enter action code E to end the processing without update.
                  5.5.9.6.4. Output. The list of delinquent document TRIC records is a screen display.
                  To get a printed copy, use the PRINT SCREEN function from the computer.

        5.5.11. Delinquent Date Change (NGV785).
           5.5.11.1. Purpose. To enter a Julian date used by the Delinquent Document Listing
           (R59/NGV781) program instead of the current processing date (located on the 002-
           Julian-DATE) when computing the delinquent and pre-delinquent days.
           5.5.11.2. Program Logic. Program NGV785, Delinquent Date Change (TRIC 1AQ,
           screen #503), does the following:
              5.5.11.2.1. Retrieves the CT-SUPPORT record and displays the delinquent date from
              the CT-SUPPORT record in the delinquent document date field.
              5.5.11.2.2. Accepts the data from the input screen and determines if the date and
              action code are valid.
           5.5.11.3. Processing TRIC 1AQ. Users can enter a new date or delete the date from the
           CT-SUPPORT record through the DELINQUENT DOCUMENT DATE CHANGE
           SCREEN. They can retrieve the screen by entering TRIC 1AQ or screen numbers #503
           or /503 from a TIP terminal.       Note: Display the screen with the date field filled with
           numeric zeros, enter 1AQ or #503. To display the current date stored in the CT-
           SUPPORT record located in the consolidated transaction history area, the user must enter
           /503 to call the Delinquent Document Date Change Screen. Only the /503 entry will
           screen the current date stored for use.

   5.5.14. Standard Base Supply System (SBSS)/Cargo Movement Operations System
   (CMOS) Interface Document Control Procedures.
       5.5.14.1. Section Summary. This section provides the document control procedures for
       the SBSS/ CMOS interface once it is implemented. This section provides a brief
       explanation of the SBSS and CMOS interface and identifies the specific procedures and
       processes.
       5.5.14.2. SBSS/CMOS Interface. The SBSS/CMOS interface establishes an electronic
       interface between the SBSS and the LRS/transportation activity. The interface provides
       the LRS/transportation activity with timely data to effectively plan, control, and schedule
       into the transportation pipeline shipments, transfers, and issues to off-base organizations
       and maximize the use of LRS/transportation activity resources and reduce transportation
       cost. In addition, it allows the LRS/transportation activity to preplan consolidation of
       shipment, transfers, and issues and to select the mode of shipment based on priority. The
       CMOS provides the SBSS with electronic record images when the LRS/transportation
       activity receives outbound cargo, and it continues to provide shipment status information
       to the SBSS until the cargo is released for shipment.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                757


  5.5.15. Document Control Process.
     5.5.15.1. Acknowledgment of Receipt. The SBSS/CMOS interface eliminates the
     requirement for a signature on the shipment, issue to off-base organizations, and transfer
     documents processed from the SBSS to the LRS/transportation activity. The
     LRS/transportation activity acknowledges receipt of these documents to the SBSS with
     an electronic image of a shipment suspense record from CMOS which updates the SNC
     detail or the shipment suspense card (SSC) detail record with an inchecker code and
     inchecked date. Signatures are required, however, for the‚ following items:
        5.5.15.1.1. Classified and NWRM Items. Documents will be signed/stamped by an
        authorized individual who is on the receipt authorization listing. If the individual who
        signed the document is not on the receipt authorization listing, process documents in
        accordance with procedures in AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5E, Sec Document Control and
        Detail Records.
        5.5.15.1.2. COMSEC Items. Shipment documents must be signed/stamped by the
        LRS/transportation activity and processed in accordance with AFMAN 23-122, Ch
        5E, Sec Document Control and Detail Records.
        5.5.15.1.3. Sensitive Items: Documents must be signed/stamped by authorized
        LRS/transportation activity personnel and processed.
     5.5.15.2. Quality Control: When the SBSS is operating under these CMOS procedures,
     quality control of shipments, transfers, and issues to off-base organizations is not
     required.    Note: When the CMOS flag is on, document control records are not
     produced for shipments, transfers, and issues to off-base organizations
     5.5.15.3. Degraded Operations. Shipment, transfer, and issue documents to off-base
     organizations will be signed/stamped by an authorized LRS/transportation activity
     person. These documents should be placed in a temporary file until SBSS processing is
     completed. Once the shipment data is known, process an SSC to update the SNC or SSC
     details.
     5.5.15.4. Document Filing. Shipment, transfer, and issue documents to off-base
     organizations which were processed using CMOS procedures are not required to be filed;
     however, the LRS CC/AO may decide to establish batch files.
     5.5.15.5. Delinquent Documents: When the CMOS flag is on during follow-up, program
     NGV588 reads the shipment suspense detail record, shipped-not-credited detail, and
     creates a follow-up (TRIC 1LY) to the CMOS system using the following delinquent
     logic:
        5.5.15.5.1. First Follow-up: If the inchecker information and the follow-up indicator
        are blank and the DOLT is older than 5 days, program NGV588 moves an A to the
        follow-up indicator and outputs a TRIC 1LY, which is then sent electronically to the
        CMOS system.
        5.5.15.5.2. Second Follow-up: If the inchecker information is blank, the follow-up
        indicator is an A, and the DOLT is older than 10 days, program NGV588 moves a B
        to the follow-up indicator and outputs a TRIC 1LY, which is then sent electronically
        to the CMOS system.
758                                                    AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.5.15.5.3. Update of Details. The CMOS response to the TRIC 1LY is a TRIC SSC
         which is automatically processed on the SBSS to update the SSC or SNC details.
  5.5.16. Consolidated Transaction History Processing.
      5.5.16.1. The CTH System is a computerized compilation of daily transaction records
      located in a reserved area of the SBLC. It is possible to store up to one year of CTH
      records. Using these compiled records, users can search the CTH area to reverse-post
      transactions, to make inquiries, and to control documents.
      5.5.16.2. Anyone who has ever had to use the D06, Daily Transaction Listing, will find
      the ease and speed of using the CTH process an improvement. Reverse-post processing
      builds reverse-post inputs from the stored CTH records. (See AFM 23-122, Sec 5G for
      automated reverse-post procedures.) CTH inquiry process allows users to research and
      compile transactions in a user defined sequence.
      5.5.16.3. Document Control uses the applicable ILS-S to clear the DCR and to update
      the document file code. The system also makes changes in function numbers and in the
      OPR to control delinquent documents identified on the Delinquent Document Listing.
      5.5.16.4. Security Responsibilities. Security measures are the responsibilities of the
      applicable end users.
  5.5.17. Consolidated Transaction History Processing.
      5.5.17.1. The consolidated transaction history software release requires DMC personnel
      to establish the CTH reserved area on the SBSS SBLC. Once the CTH area is established,
      RPS operators process the Create Consolidated Transaction History Control Record,
      Program NGV225, to create the CTHISTORY-CONTROL record (711) and the CT-
      SUPPORT record (710). This program is always available; however, reprocessing it
      should be a last resort because it requires a complete reimplementation.
      5.5.17.2. CTH File. Users may start their CTH File in one of two ways:
         5.5.17.2.1. Begin with the merge of the current day's transactions. This starts the
         CTH File from the date of implementation. See AFM 23-122 for the CTH Record
         Merge (D37/NGV778) program.
         5.5.17.2.2. Load tapes on which previous transactions are stored. Process CTH
         Record Load (UTL043) using tapes created by Daily Transaction Dump (NGV055),
         Transaction History Merge (NGV056), and CTH Record Download (UTL041).
         Program NGV043 reads the transactions stored on the magnetic tapes to the CTH
         area of the SBSS database. At the completion of the last UTL043, CTH Record Load,
         manually process a D37, CTH Merge, loading the current day's transactions into the
         CTH area. From this point on, the CTH Merge, program D37/NGV778, will load
         each new day's transactions in the CTH database.
      5.5.17.3. Daily CTH Merge. The Daily CTH Merge (D37/NGV778) does the following
      during crossover:
         5.5.17.3.1. Scans the daily transaction history area and merges selected records into
         the CTH File.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                759


        5.5.17.3.2. Creates additional records for each history record merged and modifies
        one record for each date loaded into the CTH area. The additional records, 701 (CT-
        DATE), 702 (CT-STOCKNUMBER), 703 (CT-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR), and 705
        (CT-SERIAL-NUMBER) serve as entry points for quick access to the stored CTH
        records. The modified record, 711 (CT-CONTROL- RECORD), contains a record of
        all dates loaded to the CTH area and the PURGE or oldest date on file. Additionally,
        it creates a 707 (CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL) record (DCR) for each CTH history
        requiring a DCR. The following is a list of those records.
            5.5.17.3.2.1. CT-DATE Record (701).
            5.5.17.3.2.2. CT-STOCK-NUMBER Record (702).
            5.5.17.3.2.3. CT-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR Record (703).
            5.5.17.3.2.4. CT-SERIAL-NUMBER Record (705).
            5.5.17.3.2.5. CT-HISTORY-CONTROL Record (711).                   Note: For dates
            loaded from a 056 tape using report UTL043, CTH RECORD LOAD, the first
            date loaded on the tape will be the only day reflected on the 711 (CT-HISTORY-
            CONTROL) record; however, all dates loaded will appear as an individual 701-
            CT-DATE record. For days loaded by the D37, Daily Transaction Merge, each
            date loaded is reflected on both the 711 (CT-HISTORY-CONTROL) and 701
            (CT-DATE) records.
            5.5.17.3.2.6. CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL record (707) for each CTH record
            that needs a DCR (see Pt 4, Ch 14). 18.29.4. CTH Download. CTH records
            remain on the database until downloaded to magnetic tape and deleted from the
            database. The CTH Record Download (UTL041) program is used to download
            records to the magnetic tape.
     5.5.17.4. Errors. Whenever you suspect an error in the load or maintenance of the CTH
     area, process the CTH Record Verification (UTL042) program. This program counts all
     the records for specified dates and compares the totals with the CT-HISTORY-
     CONTROL record. If the totals are unequal, the output listing shows the dates and
     records that are in error. Corrective action is then required. If the totals are equal, the
     output shows the totals and the dates.
  5.5.18. Document Control Records.
     5.5.18.1. DCR are database records maintained on the SBLC. DCRs are updated and
     maintained through a PC interface with the SBLC.
     5.5.18.2. Creating Document Control Records. During crossover, the Consolidated
     History Record Merge (D37/NGV778) program scans the daily transaction history
     records. The program selects and merges all printable transactions, then creates and stores
     a document control record (707) in the database file. See Pt 4, for the record format of a
     DCR.
     5.5.18.3. Clearing Document Control Records. When Document Control receives
     documents, they perform the quality control checks. After the quality control checks are
     completed, Document Control uses the applicable ILS-S to retrieve the DCR in order to
     update the document file code for each document.
760                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.5.18.4. Document File Codes. The document file code does two things: 1) it shows
      whether to destroy or file a document in the document file, and 2) it shows receipt of and
      processing of a fillable or destroyable document with one exception. All Materiel
      Management activities will retain all source documents with TRICs ISU, TIN, REC,
      DOR, MSI, SHP, AXA, BSU, FCH, and FCU for 75 months (6 years and 3 months)
      regardless of what is in position 53. Following are the four document file codes and their
      definition:
         5.5.18.4.1. Code F. Code F identifies the document as a file document for filing in
         the document file.
         5.5.18.4.2. Code D. Code D identifies the document as a document to be destroyed
         after validation.
         5.5.18.4.3. Code C. Code C identifies receipt, processing, and filing of a file
         document.
         5.5.18.4.4. Blank. A blank identifies receipt of a document to be destroyed and that
         the document was destroyed after verification.
      5.5.18.5. Updating Document File Codes. Document file codes are updated under the
      following conditions:
         5.5.18.5.1. When a file document passes the quality control checks, Document
         Control uses the applicable ILS-S to change the F to a C. Next, the SBLC update
         occurs through the PC interface. The SBLC program deletes the document control
         record, then retrieves the applicable CTH record and updates its document file code.
         Document Control files the document according to instructions in AFMAN 23-122,
         Sec 5E, Document Control and Detail Records.
         5.5.18.5.2. If a document to be filed does not pass the quality control edits,
         Document Control returns it to the customer. No action occurs on the DCR.
         5.5.18.5.3. When a document to be destroyed passes the quality control checks,
         Document Control uses the applicable ILS-S to change the D to a blank. Next, the
         SBLC update occurs through the PC interface. The SBLC program deletes the
         document control record, then retrieves the applicable CTH record and updates its
         document file code. Document Control destroys the source document.
         5.5.18.5.4. If a document to be destroyed does not pass the quality control edits,
         Document Control personnel return the document to the customer. No action occurs
         on the DCR
  5.5.19. Delinquent Source Document.
      5.5.19.1. Document Control is responsible for adding, changing, and deleting the DSD
      records on the database. Delinquent source documents are one of the following:
      5.5.19.2. Source Document with no DCR. Any transaction document that reaches
      Document Control that does not have a matching document control record is a DSD. This
      occurs when a transaction was not entered on the daily transaction register.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                761


     5.5.19.3. DCR with Missing Source Document. Any time a transaction is merged and the
     DCR is created but the source document is missing, the missing source document
     becomes a delinquent source document.
  5.5.20. Delinquent Document Listing.
     5.5.20.1. Document Control makes sure that the RPS processes the DDL (R59/NGV781)
     at the end of each workday. The DDL contains delinquent and pre-delinquent document
     control records and all delinquent source document records. It is a two-part listing.
     Document Control is responsible for keeping the delinquent TRIC table and the function
     numbers and OPRs updated. The Delinquent Document Listing (R59/NGV781) program
     uses the TRIC table in determining delinquent days. It uses the function number/OPR for
     page eject requirements in part two of the listing. Part two of the DDL is separated by
     function number/OPR and distributed to the responsible OPR.
     5.5.20.2. Delinquent TRIC Record. Document Control uses TRIC 1DQ, screen #412, to
     update the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record with the TRIC codes, and pre-delinquent
     and delinquent days. This record is used by the DDL program to determine delinquency.
     Para 5.5.8 gives the procedures for updating the delinquent TRIC record.
     5.5.20.3. Function Number and OPR. Document Control uses TRIC 1DP, screen #415,
     to update the CT-DELINQUENT-OPR (709) records on the database. This record (709)
     contains the function numbers and the OPRs. The function number is the output terminal
     number from the transaction history record for the applicable document control record.
     5.5.20.4. Delinquent Date. Document Control uses TRIC 1AQ, screen #503, to enter,
     change, or delete the delinquent date on the CT-SUPPORT record (710). This date
     overrides the current Julian date in determining delinquency. Allows you to enter a date
     greater than the current date to use in determining the delinquency.       Note: If the
     override date is used, reset the date to zeros before processing the next Delinquent
     Document Listing. Do this by retrieving screen 503 by keying in /503 and pressing
     <ENTER>. After the screen is displayed with the date currently stored on the system,
     cursor to the Action Code field, enter a D, and press <ENTER>. This will reset the date
     stored on the database to zeros, which will force the delinquent document listing to use
     the current machine date for determining delinquency.
     5.5.20.5. Building the DDL. The DDL contains data from the DCR, the DSD record, and
     the item record. The DDL program selects all DSD records for printing. It scans the
     DCRs and compares the transaction date from the transaction date/serial number field to
     the current Julian date or override date to determine the number of day’s difference. The
     program compares this difference to the applicable TRIC and delinquent/pre-delinquent
     days on the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, and validates the function number and
     OPR with the CT-DELINQUENT-OPR record.
     5.5.20.6. Printing the DDL. All the DSD records and the selected DCRs are sorted and
     printed as a two-part listing. Each part of the two-part listing is divided into delinquent
     and pre-delinquent sections. Users may print the delinquent or pre-delinquent section, or
     both sections. Note: Recommend both delinquent and pre-delinquent sections always be
     printed.
762                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.5.20.6.1. Line numbers. The program assigns a sequential line number to each
         printed record. The line number assigned to a record stays the same in both part one
         and part two of the listing. This assigned number is only good for the run being
         processed. The number can change when the next listing processes if updates
         occurred to the DCR or DSD database records.
         5.5.20.6.2. Part One. Part one of the listing is Document Control's copy of the DDL.
         Part one lists all delinquent and pre-delinquent documents. A control break occurs on
         the change of system designator and type of listing. A summary total of TRICs, the
         Julian date used to determine delinquency, and the Delinquent TRIC Table print on
         the completion of each control break. Part one is sorted as follows:
             5.5.20.6.2.1. System designator, major sort.
             5.5.20.6.2.2. Type listing (delinquent/pre-delinquent), first intermediate sort.
             5.5.20.6.2.3. TRIC, second intermediate sort.
             5.5.20.6.2.4. Document number, minor sort.
         5.5.20.6.3. Part Two. Part two of the DDL goes to the individual sections/elements or
         offices within the SBSS. Control breaks occur on change of system designator, first;
         on function number, second; and on type of listing, third. Part two is sorted as
         follows:
             5.5.20.6.3.1. System designator, major sort.
             5.5.20.6.3.2. Function number, first intermediate sort (The function number is the
             output terminal number from the DCR and DSD).
             5.5.20.6.3.3. Type listing (delinquent/pre-delinquent), second intermediate sort.
             5.5.20.6.3.4. TRIC.
             5.5.20.6.3.5. Document number.
      5.5.20.7. Distribution. Distribute copies of the DDL to the following four agencies as
      well as to other agencies local management has chosen: Materiel Management Flight and
      Deployment and Distribution Flight.; Flights use the listing to speed up the completion
      and return of delinquent documents. A copy of part one of the DDL goes to Document
      Control; applicable elements of part two go to the individual functions.
      5.5.20.8. Annotation. Mark Document Control's copy of the DDL to show the documents
      still being processed and the flight responsible. Update the OPR by using the Document
      Control Menu and the Read Change Work File program. Methods for clearing delinquent
      documents depends on local requirements. For example, you may visit each flight
      monitor or hold daily delinquent document meetings.
      5.5.20.9. Destruction of the Delinquent Listing. You may destroy the Document Control
      copy of the delinquent listing after you have annotated the next day's run of the listing.
  5.5.21. Electronic Document Control (EDC).

      5.6.1.3. Item Record Preparation for Record Reversal
         5.6.1.3.1. Assign freeze code “Q” to item records requiring record reversal if one is
         not currently assigned use TRIC Freeze Code Load/Delete (FFC). This action
         prevents further transaction processing against the item record during research for
         record reversal. Record reversal processing can be accomplished with freeze codes
         “Q, I, and C.” All other freeze codes will need to be cleared before attempting record
         reversal processing. Interchangeables and Substitutes (ISG) may also be require to be
         frozen.
         5.6.1.3.2. Print a copy of the freeze code load notice and attach it to the reversal
         record source document and forward to the applicable office performing the record
         reversal.
         5.6.1.3.3. Successful reversal record processing will automatically release freeze
         code “Q” except for Due-Out Releases (DOR’s). An I105 MGT notice (RVP Freeze
         Code Q Removed From I/R Input Stock Number) is output on the Document Control
         terminal or RPS/main system to advise Document Control of the removal of the
         freeze code. If the input is to reverse TRIC DOR, an additional record reversal of
         TRIC Receipt (REC) or Turn In (TIN) is not required, then upon record successful
         record reversal process FFC to remove the freeze code “Q.” This is required because
         DOR record reversal will not remove freeze code “Q” automatically.
         5.6.1.3.4. If a freeze code “Q” is loaded on an item record in error, or through
         research it is determined a record reversal is not required, the freeze code “Q” must
         be deleted using TRIC FFC.

         5.6.1.5. Detail Records
                5.6.1.5.1. Detail Records. If the transaction affects in-use, supply point, Special
                Purpose Recoverable Asset Maintenance (SPRAM), War Reserve Material (WRM),
                Mission Support Kit (MSK), Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) or In-Place
                Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) details, make sure that authorized detail records are
                loaded for the document number being reversed. In addition, load any sub-details
                that were previously deleted. The reverse record program will increase or decrease
                detail records when required. If you process a record reversal for a detail record, and
                the on-hand quantity becomes zero, the computer will not delete the record if the
                authorized quantity is one or more. When the on-hand quantity is reduced to zero,
                and if the detail record contains part number or supplementary data, the computer will
                NOT delete substitute supply point detail records.
 768                                                         AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


           5.6.1.5.2. If the transaction affects Due-in from Maintenance (DIFM) unserviceable
           detail records, record reversal programs will add, increase, delete, or decrease these
           detail records as required. The unserviceable detail is built by the record reversal
           input. No prior load of the detail is required. For TIN/REC transactions, a DIFM
           unserviceable detail record must be loaded for the document number (positions 67-
           80) being reversed.
        5.6.1.6. Record Reversal Pricing
           5.6.1.6.1. Material Support Division (MSD) prices will appear on the transaction
           history. You must input all prices for each TTPC, if applicable, on the reversal record
           input for proper Accounting and Finance updates to the General Ledger Account
           (GLA).
        5.6.1.7. Moving Average Cost (MAC)
           5.6.1.7.1. The Moving Average Cost (MAC) is required on all reversal record
           transactions for budget code 9 assets. If the input results in a 373 reject, enter the
           MAC (901-FILLER-5) on the CTH from the original transaction in the MAC field on
           the Reversal Record screen and reprocess the input. If you are processing a record
           reversal transaction that occurred before the Inventory Valuation updates were
           implemented (1 Oct 00) then enter zeros in the MAC field. Note: Failure to input
           prices will result in erroneous updates to the GLA.
   5.6.2. Issue/MSI Record Reversal.
        5.6.2.1. Purpose. To establish the format for issue (ISU) and MSI record reversal (RVP)
        inputs. All data for RVP ISU are obtained from the transaction which updated the item
        record balance. All data for RVP MSI are obtained from the transaction which
        decreased/deleted the MRSP/IRSP/MSK/SPRAM/DIFM detail that property was issued
        from.
        5.6.2.2. Input Restrictions. Restricted by user-ID in appropriate IT system.
        5.6.2.3. Output. See Record Reversal Output Document following Table 5.226

Table 5.221. Issue/MSI Record Reversal Entry Requirements.

issue, enter the authority for issue flag code; otherwise leave blank.
5. The following information applies:
a. If the type transaction (pos. 4-6) is a serviceable MSI, enter the applicable authorized/in-
use/MRSP/MSK or WRM document number in pos. 91-104.
b. If the type transaction (positions 4-6) is MSI and the activity code (position 30) is S (supply point
issue), leave this field blank.
c. For all other serviceable transactions, enter the stock number requested.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     771


d. If the transaction is a result of a Bulk Issue Reconciliation (BIR) input (IEX 6 only), enter the
requested stock number.
e. If the type transaction (positions 4-6) is an unserviceable MSI, enter the unserviceable status code
and DIFM unserviceable detail record document number in positions 90-104.
6. If the transaction affects an authorized/in-use, MSK, MRSP, supply point, or WRM spares detail
record, enter the appropriate type transaction phrase code applicable to the detail record.
7. This must be 1A, 3P, 3Q, or blank. This field is left blank only when no 1A, 3P, or 3Q was created.
8. Compute manually when required. If the unit of issue on the item record being reversal record
posted is different from the unit of issue of the requested stock number, enter the number of cumulative
recurring demands that should be reduced on the requested item record. (EXAMPLE: If the action
quantity of the item record being reversal record is 1 with a unit of issue of HD and the requested stock
number unit of issue is each, enter 00100 in this field.) If the unit of issue on both stock numbers is the
same, leave this field blank.
9. If the ISU/MSI was budget code 8 (Material Support Division), enter 7Y in positions 120-121 and
the extended cost from the 7Y transaction history in positions 122-131.
10. This field is only applicable to TRIC MSI (positions 4-6) when the detail asset status flag is set to
P (partial deployment). Then enter O to increase the detail on-hand quantity or D to increase the detail
deployed quantity.
11. If the ISU was for an equipment management code 1, 2, or 3 item and the Air Force Equipment
Management System (AFEMS) flag was on, enter what is stored in the 901-REASON-WHY-CODE of
the 1L or 1N transaction history. Normally, this would be an R.
12. Enter Job Order Cost Accounting System (JOCAS) number from transaction history when 901-
JOCAS-NBR is not blank.
13. Enter Defense Business Operating Fund flag from transaction history when 901-DBOF-FLAG is
not blank.
14. Enter the applicable MSD prices from the transaction history record for budget code 8 assets.
15. If the ISU/MSI was budget code 9, then enter the extended MAC from the CTH record.
      5.6.3. Turn-In Record Reversal.
         5.6.3.1. Purpose. To create reversal record transactions for TIN’s. All input data are
         obtained from the different transaction histories created by turn-in processing. The input
         format lists the Daily Transaction Register (print positions) and transaction history
         inquiry (output field heading and position) references for each input field.
         5.6.3.2. Input Restrictions. Restricted by user-ID in appropriate IT system.

0,2*,3,or 4. Enter the DIFM status flag from the STOCKAGE-PRIORITY-CODE on the applicable TIN:
(TTPC = 2M, 2N, 2O, 2P, or 2U) transaction history record. * If a ‘2’ (credit DIFM) is to be entered,
ensure a corresponding due-out detail is loaded. If the corresponding due-out is not loaded, then enter a ‘0’
for the DIFM Status Flag. The reason for this is that the due-out was released to and the DIFM detail was
no longer a credit.
3. If transaction is for a REMS item (TTPC 2W), this field will contain type detail code V.
4. Enter GY when processing a reversal record for a turn-in for a budget-code 8 DIFM item that granted
customer credit and created a 1PU/GY transaction. Enter 7Y when processing a record reversal for an
unserviceable turn-in for a use-code D equipment item that created a 1PU/7Y transaction.
5. Enter the extended cost from the 1PU transaction created by the TIN have a record reversal processed.
This figure is used to charge or credit the customer's account.

price, C for carcass cost, or M for mark-up price. The type of price is determined by the 7Y/GY extended
cost entered in positions 145-154.
8. If the TIN was for an equipment management code 1, 2, or 3 item and the AFEMS flag was on, enter
what is stored in the 901-REASON-WHY-CODE of the 1L or 1N transaction history. This should be an R.
9. Enter Job Order Cost Accounting System number from transaction history when 901-JOCAS-NBR is
not blank.
10. Enter the extended cost from the TTPC 2O, 2M, 2U transaction history when applicable.
11. Enter the applicable MSD prices from the transaction history record for budget code 8 assets.
12. This field will be utilized when there is an update to the 203-Disposition-Response-Code field on the
DIFM detail being reversed.
13. If the TIN was budget code 9, then enter the Extended MAC from the 1B transaction.
14. If the transaction affects an authorized in-use, MSK, RSP,IRSP, supply point, or WRM detail; enter
the appropriate TTPC applicable to the detail record.
      5.6.4. Due-Out Release Record Reversal.
         5.6.4.1. Purpose. To create record reversal transactions for due-out releases (DOR). All
         data is obtained from the transaction history indicated below.    Note: Record Reversal
         of non-MICAP DOR will require a subsequent Due-In/Due-Out Update (DIT) input to
         restore a meaningful Mark-For field on the due-out detail, except when such a Mark-For
         did not previously exist.
         5.6.4.2. Input Restrictions. Restricted by user-ID in appropriate IT system.
         5.6.4.3. Output. See Record Reversal Output Document following Table 5.226

Table 5.223. Due-Out Release Record Reversal Entry Requirements.

a non-MICAP UJC in positions 104-105 and a due-out indicator of 1 in position 7.
b. When an REC is not being reversed, process the record reversal with a non-MICAP UJC in
positions 104-105, a TEX code 7 in position 107 and a due-out indicator of 1 in position 7.
c. Forward I257 MGT notice (D/O Detail Established – DIT Input Required to Complete
Processing)to Mission Support for processing DIT, NOR, or SPR, as applicable.

   5.6.8. Automated Record Reversal Procedures.
       5.6.8.1. Purpose. To create record reversal inputs from CTH records.
       5.6.8.2. Processing. After identifying a transaction that needs to be reversed, the first
       step in processing is to get inquiries of the transaction history records. If the transactions
       are not in the CTH database, automated RVP procedures will not work. If the transaction
       is in the daily transaction history (901) record area, regular RVP procedures apply. The
       next step is open the INQRVP on the applicable IT system. Fill in the TTPC, date, and
       serial number of the transaction to process (see Table 5.224). Then program 665 does
       the following:
       5.6.8.3. Edits the 1AM input screen for a valid TTPC and date/serial number.
       5.6.8.4. Retrieves the CTH record from the database and determines if the TTPC on the
       CTH record matches the input.
       5.6.8.5. Edits the record to ensure the TRIC and TTPC are authorized for record reversal.
       5.6.8.6. Formats a record reversal image on the appropriate RVP screen (see Para 5.6.2
       through 5.6.7).

  5.6.10. Records Reversal Internal Processing.
     5.6.10.1. Record reversal transaction histories contain the same basic data as the original
     transaction history with these exceptions: the date of last transaction, date and
     transaction serial number, and the type transaction phrase code (always alpha-alpha).
     The flag for DCC and transaction register print is the same as the original transaction
     history. The computer may alter the type transaction phrase code on the record reversal
     transaction history according to the adjustments of specific detail records. For example,
     if you reverse a DOR with a due-out detail TTPC of 2A (minus due-out detail), and the
     due-out was deleted before inputting the record reversal, the reversal program will add a
     due-out detail record and change the TTPC to 2C.
     5.6.10.2. Finance Aspects of Records Reversal
        5.6.10.2.1. Edit the input FIA code for compatibility with budget code and TRIC. If
        the input code is not compatible, produce an I202 MGT notice (FIA Code Not Valid).
        5.6.10.2.2. Edit the transaction history for compatibility of other data elements with
        FIA code. If edits are not passed, the program will output I202 MGT notice.
        EXAMPLE INPUT: TRIC ISU, TEX code D, activity code E, and FIA code 331.
        This input is rejected because of the erroneous assignment of FIA code 331 with TEX
        code D.
        5.6.10.2.3. Assign materiel category/source of supply codes (MC/SS) to transactions
        that update the SMAG IMR.
        5.6.10.2.4. Update the PFMR for SMAG issue and turn-in transactions. Test the
        fund availability for each SMAG turn-in record reversal. If this test shows funds are
        not available to cover the transactions, A916 MGT notice is output by the program.
        5.6.10.2.5. Update the MACR for applicable receipt transactions and create TTPC
        1X reversals of previous over-short receipt processing.
        5.6.10.2.6. Create BNR detail records when a record reversal of a funded receipt is
        processed and the corresponding RNB detail record is not located.
        5.6.10.2.7. Move the input FIA code to the transaction history TTPC HY and assign
        FIA code 330 or 331 to the transaction history TTPC GY when TRIC 1PU is input.
     5.6.10.3. Interface processing
        5.6.10.3.1. The SBSS will provide CMOS an electronic image of a record reversal
        record (TRIC 1LZ) when a shipment, transfer to DLADS, or an off-base issue
        processed through the base Cargo Movement is reversed.
        5.6.10.3.2. The record reversal shipment program will bypass CMOS interface if the
        original shipment was not processed through the base Cargo Movement. (For
        example, if the AL/2LM flag on the repair cycle record (102-FILLER-1) is equal to
        B, D, or E.
        5.6.10.3.3. If TRIC CWMs are output as a result of record reversal processing,
        Computer Operations enters the following data into format A:

                 blank warehouse location, the item record is updated with the current
                 date as the DOLI. When used in conjunction with another option, the
                 selected record DOLI must be equal to or less than the requested
                 DOLI and the selected record must be equal to the other requested
                 option(s).

                 zero balance, enter a dash (-) in position 47. Other options may not be
                 used with this option. The item record is updated with the current date
                 as the DOLI.
7                To delete CIC images and remove the freeze code C from the item
                 records, enter a dash (-) in position 67. The parameter input must be
                 the same as the one used to create the CIC images. This option may
                 be used with any parameter. However, if an option other than
                 warehouse selection is used, all other inventory counts in progress
                 must be completed before input of the parameter format. The
                 warehouse location is mandatory in the backout option.

Notes:
1                  Before input, enter the recount quantity into positions 22-29.
2                  Positions 30-31 will contain RC when the CIC quantity does not
                   equal the item record inventory balance. This indicates recount
                   action is required/pending. When the IRC with RC in positions
                   30-31 is processed, the ILS-S compares the IRC quantity to the
                   item record inventory balance. If the quantities are unequal and
                   the automatic adjustment criteria are not met, the system will
                   programmatically produce a new IRC with AR in positions 30-
                   31 to indicate additional research is required. Re-input of the
                   IRC with AR in positions 30-31 will adjust the item record
                   inventory balance and update the applicable inventory accuracy
                   records.
3                  Input the detail record number to be inventoried.
4                  For all details, enter the document number in positions 35-48.

5                  Position 50 will contain the materiel condition code (E, F, G, H,
                   J, K, L, Q, R, or W).
    5.7.4. Automatic Adjustment Criteria.
         5.7.4.1. Purpose. To describe the conditions under which automatic adjustments are
         made when system inventory balance quantities differ from inventory recount quantities.
         5.7.4.2. Items Involved. If the inventory balance and the computer balance do not agree,
         the ILS-S will make programmatic adjustments to reconcile the item record balance with
         the recount quantity for certain serviceable items. These automatic inventory quantity
         adjustments will be made only after an inventory recount is performed and the following
         conditions are met:
            5.7.4.2.1. Record Balance. The item record inventory balance does not agree with
            the recount quantity for type account code B.
            5.7.4.2.2. Adjustment Value. The dollar value for automatic adjustment, computed
            by multiplying the adjusted quantity by the unit price, is within the following limits:
                5.7.4.2.2.1. Pilferable items less than $100.00.
                5.7.4.2.2.2. Controlled item code U, unclassified items less than $1,000.00.

                  Note: Items with controlled item code 7, although considered unclassified for
                  storage and handling purposes, require research prior to adjustment.
            5.7.4.2.3. Inventory Recount Output Formats. If there is a discrepancy between the
            inventory balance and the item record inventory balance and the items do not meet
            the above criteria, the ILS-S produces an IRC (inventory recount output format). See
            Para. 5.7.3 for IRC format.
            5.7.4.2.4. Documentation of Automatic Inventory Balance Adjustments.
                  5.7.4.2.4.1. AUTO-COMPL. The phrase AUTO-COMPL identifies automatic
                  adjustments on both the transaction register (stock number requested field) (print-
                  punch flag contains A) and the consolidated inventory adjustment document
                  register.
   5.7.5. Special Inventory Interrogation Input (1GP).
         5.7.5.1. Purpose. To assign freeze code I, produce inventory recount outputs (IRCs) and
         produce a special inventory count output notice (see Para. 5.7.6) containing the asset,
         detail, and history information pertinent to the type of inventory count requested. The
         activity requesting the special inventory count prepares and processes the special
         inventory count interrogation input.
         5.7.5.2. Input Restrictions. Pseudo or any terminal based on system designator and user-
         ID/password. If you do not use the return-to-input function, the output goes to terminal
         function 80 (inventory). If you use a satellite function for the input, the output is returned
         to that function.
         5.7.5.3. Output. See Special Inventory Output Notice (Para 5.7.6).

special purpose asset detail record to which the item is being transferred. When the transfer
satisfies a due-out, then the custodian cancels the due-out. When a special purpose asset detail
record is not loaded for this document number and input stock number, the FET program
establishes a substitute detail record.
6. Decrease Authorized Quantity (positions 69-73). Enter the decrease authorized quantity field
only if you desire adjustment of the authorized quantity on the losing special purpose asset detail
record. The figure in this field is subtracted automatically from the authorized quantity on the
prime record of the losing detail record document number. The figure in this field cannot exceed
the input action quantity or the authorized quantity on the losing record.
a. If the authorized quantity is reduced to zero and no on-hand quantity remains on the prime or
substitute records, the prime record (and substitute records) is deleted.
b. If the authorized quantity is reduced to zero and there are on-hand quantities remaining, a 246
REJ notice is output.
7. Increase Authorized Quantity (positions 74-78). Enter the increase authorized quantity only if
you desire an adjustment of the authorized quantity on the gaining special purpose asset detail
record. The figure in this field is added automatically to the authorized quantity on the prime
detail record of the gaining document number. The figure in this field cannot exceed the input
action quantity.
8. If you want the words” post-post” printed to reflect manual processing on the issue and turn-in
documents, enter the number “6.” The program will ignore any other entry. Note: Post-post is a

     5.9.2. Processing Condition Changes.
        5.9.2.1. Purpose. To describe the processing of condition changes, the condition change
        (FCC) input format and the condition change output document.
        5.9.2.2. Recording Condition Changes. Inspection personnel record condition changes
        on the item record by processing a condition change (FCC) input. The FCC input records
        the change by reducing the item record serviceable balance and creating an unserviceable
        detail record or vice versa. An FCC input will also change the unserviceable condition
        on an unserviceable detail. For example, condition code J (suspended in stock) can be
        changed to condition code H (condemned). The unserviceable detail document number
        will not change when unserviceable condition codes are changed from one to another.
        Inspection personnel notify Stock Control of all changes to the unserviceable balance
        field, except for those increases when program control makes immediate disposition.
        5.9.2.3. Condition Change (FCC) Input Format and Entry Requirements. The condition
        change (FCC) input may be input using screens FCC and FCCSAT at any terminal based
        upon the user-ID/password. The FCC input format and entry requirements are described
        in Table 5.254
        5.9.2.4. Condition Change (FCC) Output. The formats for the Condition Change (FCC)
        Document and Reparable Disposition Notice (FCC) are described in Table 5.259, Table
        5.260, Table 5.261, and Table 5.262.

Notes:
 1                    Document Number (positions 4-17). The first six positions of
                      the document number must be Z followed by 004NS (for base
                      accounts), 041NS through 049NS (for satellite accounts). CSB
                      organization numbers (004 or 012) may be used when the CSB
                      Inspection performs satellite inspection functions.
2                     The R920RW document number and the unserviceable status
                      code are required only when position 60 contains a condition
                      code of E, F, G, J, K, L, or Q (see Table 5.255. for
                      unserviceable item status codes).
3                     Change from Condition Code (position 60). Use the condition
                      codes listed in paragraph above, with the exception of condition
                      code H (condemned).
4                     Change to Condition Code (position 61). Use condition codes
                      listed in paragraph above. Enter an H if automatic transfer
                      action to the DLADS is desired for condemned and/or outdated
                      shelf life items. Condition code H is restricted to ERRC XB3
                      and NF1 only. All other ERRCDs must be processed through
                      maintenance.
5                     The unserviceable warehouse location (positions 67-77) must
                      conform to the format in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.

2                              This code will only be printed if the condition code is
                               changed on an unserviceable detail.
3                              The health hazard item phrase is printed when the item
                               record issue exception code is 8 or 9. The issue
                               exception phrase is printed only when the item record
                               contains an issue exception code and then, only if the
                               first position of the issue exception phrase on the
                               exception phrase record has an asterisk (*) in the first
                               position. The parts preference code is printed only if the
                               item record has a numeric parts preference code. The
                               Deficiency Report exhibit phrase is printed when a
                               supply condition code of Q is assigned. The
                               TCTO/Functional Check Required phrase is printed
                               when the item record has a TCTO flag loaded or
                               functional check flag loaded.
4                              This phrase is printed if the issue exception code is B.
                               Enter the required data. If the item is a weapon, forward
                               one copy to Document Control, otherwise forward one
                               copy to Contract Maintenance.
5                              This field is printed from the unserviceable detail record.
            5.9.2.5.3. Reparable Disposition Notice (FCC). The reparable disposition notice
            (FCC) is produced to notify Stock Control of an increase to the unserviceable asset
            position of an item in the system.
               5.9.2.5.4. Output Destination. The reparable disposition notice is output to the
               RPS terminal (terminal 444) or the Stock Control terminal.

    5.9.3. Processing Identity Changes.
        5.9.3.1. Purpose: To describe the processing of identity changes, the Identify Change
        input (FCH) format and the Identity Change (FCH) Document output format.
        5.9.3.2. Processing FCH Inputs. Identity change inputs (FCH) are processed for ONLY
        the following purposes:
           5.9.3.2.1. To correct errors of identification for serviceable items in storage. When
           Storage and Issue personnel find incorrectly identified serviceable items in stock, they
           ask Inspection personnel to identify the materiel. If the identity error is the result of a
           manufacturer’s identification error an FCH is authorized. For example, the
           manufacturer put the wrong part number on an item and the part number cross-
           references to an AM radio, but the item itself is an FM radio.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 831


        5.9.3.2.2. To transfer overflow adjunct record balances between two records (basic
        and -9) and to transfer supplemental adjunct balances between the two records (basic
        and -1/-2). Inspection personnel create and process these inputs with the advice and
        consent of Stock Control.
        5.9.3.2.3. To re-identify tires being recapped with a different tread.
        5.9.3.2.4. A special inventory must be requested for all other discrepancies in
        identification, see Para 5.7.5 for details. Inventory personnel research transaction
        histories, and, if possible, initiate reverse-post procedures to correct the discrepancy.
        If research shows reverse-posting is not possible, inventory adjustments (IRC) will be
        used to correct the discrepancy.
        5.9.3.2.5. Weapons or CCI/COMSEC Items. The identity change of a Weapon or
        CCI/COMSEC asset will NOT be allowed. A 618 reject will occur when the From or
        To stock number’s serialized report code is equal to an "A" or "C".
     5.9.3.3. Adjusting the Inventory Record. Each identity change transaction creates both a
     decrease and an increase inventory adjustment record. These adjustments appear as
     separate entities on the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register. The
     certification and approval of identity change adjustments are outlined in Para 5.9.5
     Note:      The transfer of assets from or to an adjunct record does NOT update the
     Inventory Accuracy Records.
     5.9.3.4. Correcting Discrepancies in Identification of Items on Details. When possible,
     Inspection personnel use reverse-posting to correct the identification of items on detail
     records. When it is not possible to use reverse-post procedures, or when the discrepancy
     results from a manufacturer's error, use the following guidelines to change the identity:
        5.9.3.4.1. To correctly identify items recorded on in-use detail records, use FER
        inputs (see Para 5.4.4 for details).
        5.9.3.4.2. To change the identity of items recorded on DIFM (FIRM), supply point,
        WRM, or REM detail records, use the following procedures:
            5.9.3.4.2.1. Process a TIN input for the quantity misidentified, using TEX code 8.
            5.9.3.4.2.2. Process an FIL to load the item record for the change-to stock
            number/system designator, if it is not already loaded.
            5.9.3.4.2.3. Process an FCH input for the misidentified quantity, using TEX code
            8.
            5.9.3.4.2.4. Process a detail record load input, if necessary.
            5.9.3.4.2.5. Process an ISU for the reidentified quantity, unless the property has
            been returned to warehouse storage.
        5.9.3.4.3. To change the identity of items on unserviceable detail records, use the
        following procedures:
            5.9.3.4.3.1. Process an FCC to return the item to serviceable condition. (Use
            TEX 8 to suppress DOR.)
            5.9.3.4.3.2. Process an FCH to reidentify the item. (Use TEX 8 to suppress

              DOR.)
              5.9.3.4.3.3. Process an FCC to return the item to unserviceable condition.
       5.9.3.5. Identify Change Input (FCH). The identity change input (FCH) is used to
       change the recorded identity of an item by transferring assets from one item record to
       another.
          5.9.3.5.1. Input Format and Entry Requirements. The identify change input (FCH)
          may be input using screens FCH and FCHSAT, at any terminal based upon the user-
          ID/password. The input format and entry requirements are identified in Table 5.260
          5.9.3.5.2. Output. See Identity Change Document (FCH) in the next paragraph.

                           occur if the Change-From Stock Number is an adjunct (-9)
                           stock number. Once the basic stock number has been
                           entered, program control transfers the required quantity
                           from the (-9) record when appropriate.
3                          Decimal Locator, Conversion Factor, and Change to
                           Quantity.
                           Leave the Change To Quantity field blank. The Change
                           To Quantity will be computed as follows.
                           a. When the Change From Stock Number and the Change
                           To Stock Number have the same unit of issue, the Change
                           From Quantity will be the Change To Quantity.
                           b. When the Change From Stock Number and the Change
                           To Stock Number have different units of issue the system
                           will compute the Change To Quantity based on the
                           standard unit of issue conversion table. If the unit of issue
                           is not in the standard unit of issue conversion table then the
                           conversion factor must be entered in positions 46-49.
                           Note: Reject 053 (Conversion Factor Invalid) will occur
                           if program control cannot internally perform the
                           conversion (for example, if the results of the internal
                           conversion do not equal a complete unit of issue).
4                          Transaction Exception Code (TEX). Choices are:
                           a. TEX 8: Do Not Release Due-outs.
                           b. TEX E: Suppress Federal Supply Class/ERRCD Edits.

1                          Leading zeros are suppressed on this field.
2                          This phrase and/or code is printed when applicable.
3                          This phrase is printed if the issue exception code is B (the item is
                           under warranty or serial number control). Enter the required

            5.9.3.6.3. Authentication of Identity Changes. Identity Changes must be certified
            and approved by the appropriate officials as indicated in Para 5.9.5 The appropriate
            officials sign the signature page of the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document
            (IAD) Register to certify and approve identity changes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3,
            Ch 3 for more information concerning the Consolidated IAD Register report.
   5.9.4. Processing Warehouse Change Documents.
       5.9.4.1. Purpose.    To describe generation and processing of warehouse change
       documents.
       5.9.4.2. Warehouse Change Documents. Certain Materiel Management transactions will
       automatically cause the generation of warehouse change documents. Transactions that
       will cause the automatic generation of a warehouse change document are:
            5.9.4.2.1. Item Record Indicative Data Changes (FIC). When an item record
            indicative data changes (FIC) input changes a stock number, system designator, or
            ERRCD. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. for the output format. A warehouse

        change document will NOT be produced when the FIC input changes only the last
        two positions of the national stock number (positions 14-15). It is, therefore, NOT
        necessary to keep positions 14-15 of the national stock number current on external
        tags, bin labels, etc. The 13-digit national stock number is the basis for Materiel
        Management transactions on these items.
        5.9.4.2.2. FCU Inputs. When an FCU input changes the unit of issue. (See AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format.)
        5.9.4.2.3. 1SC Input. When a 1SC input changes a controlled item code. (See AFH
        23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format.)
     5.9.4.3. Receipt of Warehouse Change Documents. Warehouse personnel must process
     warehouse change documents as quickly as possible. Upon receipt of warehouse change
     documents, warehouse personnel will do the following:
        5.9.4.3.1. Update labels, tags, and listings. Change the applicable data on bin labels,
        property tags, locator listing (Stock Number Directory), etc.
           5.9.4.3.1.1. Shelf Life and Issue Exception Code Changes. Program control
           prints the shelf life code and issue exception code in line one, print positions 79
           and 80 respectively on all FIC warehouse change notices. When applicable,
           warehouse personnel use these data to update external files.
           5.9.4.3.1.2. Zero Balance Procedures. When a unit of issue change results in a
           zero balance because there is an insufficient quantity on hand to show a balance,
           warehouse personnel must get AFMC SCM-R Stock control Activity to help
           resolve the problem. For example, if the item is critical or in short supply locally,
           local management must decide if adjunct (-1) records should be loaded.
        5.9.4.3.2. Relocate property, if necessary. Relocation may be necessary when the
        following occur:
           5.9.4.3.2.1. Controlled item code is changed. The Materiel Management Flight
           Commander or Superintendent must approve any relocation of the property
           caused by controlled item code changes by signing the warehouse change
           document. When changing from classified to unclassified, warehouse personnel
           must verify the change to the controlled item code originated through the SNUD.
           If the change did not originate through SNUD, warehouse personnel process a
           1SC input to reinstate the previous (FROM) controlled item code stated on the
           warehouse change document. If the change was received through SNUD, it
           should be valid. However, if the Materiel Management Flight Commander or
           Superintendent believes the change compromises security, warehouse personnel
           immediately ask Records Maintenance to validate the controlled item codes. In
           the meantime, the property remains in secure storage.
           5.9.4.3.2.2. Stock numbers are consolidated.
        5.9.4.3.3. Coordinate with Inspection. Coordinate with Inspection when property
        requires inspection.
        5.9.4.3.4. DD 1348-1A. Initial and date block 27 of the DD 1348-1A and then
        forward the original to Document Control.
840                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.9.4.4. Daily Document Register. The Daily Document Register contains entries for 1)
      FID inputs that recorded a warehouse location on the deleted item record, and 2) FCU,
      FIC, and 1SC inputs that recorded an unserviceable detail record for an item. (See AFH
      23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 14 for the formats of transaction histories.) Warehouse storage
      personnel process the Daily Document Register as described below and then destroy it.
      Should any subsequent research be necessary, use the Daily Document Register
      maintained by Document Control. Note: The LRS/Accountable Officer signature is not
      needed on the portion of Daily Document Register processed by warehouse storage
      personnel.
         5.9.4.4.1. FID Entries on the Daily Document Register. FID entries on the Daily
         Document Register are arranged sequentially by location (as stated in the document
         number field). Storage and Issue personnel must verify all locations.
             5.9.4.4.1.1. If the location is empty, remove or obliterate the bin label and cross-
             out the corresponding entry on the locator listing.
             5.9.4.4.1.2. If the location contains property, prepare a request for special
             inventory and forward it to Inventory. Enter the location of the property on the
             request for special inventory but DO NOT cross out the corresponding entry on
             the locator listing (although this may be annotated to indicate that the item record
             was deleted).
         5.9.4.4.2. FCU, FIC, and 1SC Entries on the Daily Document Register. The FCU,
         FIC, and 1SC entries on the Daily Document Register indicate warehouse change
         documents for unserviceable assets. They are arranged sequentially by document
         number, which will have activity code R, organization code 920, and shop code RW
         in its first seven positions. The FIC entries indicate changes to stock number, system
         designators, and/or ERRCD. The 1SC entries indicate changes to controlled item
         code, and the FCU entries indicate changes to unit of issue.
  5.9.5. Authentication of Inventory Adjustments and Identity Changes.
      5.9.5.1. Purpose. To identify certification and approval signature requirements for
      inventory adjustments and identity changes.

                                    MATERIEL RETURNS

Section 6A—Overview

6.1. Overview. This chapter outlines reference information for materiel management processes
associated with materiel returns and disposal of materiel. These processes include Returns,
Disposal and the Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP). Additional materiel management
guidance on these processes can be found in AFI 23-101 and in AFMAN 23-122.

Section 6B—Returns (Turn-ins)

6.2. Returns (Turn-ins).
   6.2.1. Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN).
         6.2.1.1. Purpose. This section provides the format for processing recoverable item
         returns (turn-ins) to the ILS-S. The section is provided in two parts. Table 6.1 is the
         input TIN transaction format for processing recoverable item returns. Table 6.2 provides
         additional instruction detailing the mark-for field of the TIN transaction.

Notes:
1. Tote Box/Hold Bay (positions 4-6). Data entered in this field will be printed in the
warehouse location field.
a. If the input is through the RPS/main system, and if line 2 contains action phrase BIN
XXXXX IN LOCATION XXXXXXXXXX, or if the input is rejected, the tote box/hold
bay will appear in positions 57-59 of the output DD 1348-1A.
b. If it is not practical to assign a tote box/hold bay before computer processing,
establish local procedures for controlling these assets.
2. Disposal authority or shipment exception (SEX) code (position 7). This is a multiple
purpose field used with other entries to direct or modify process.
a. When position 62 contains action taken code 9 or positions 48-50 contain TRM, the
applicable disposal authority code G or H will be entered. If this field is left blank, the
appropriate disposal authority code will be assigned by the program.
b. If the item is not condemned, leave the field blank or enter a shipment exception code.
When the item record contains shipment exception code 1, 2, or 3 and automatic
shipment is desired, the same code must be entered.
3. Quantity (positions 25-29). This field must be numeric values other than all zeros.
a. When turn-ins do not affect detail records, a quantity greater than 9 cannot be used
unless TEX code 5 is entered in position 51.
b. Turn-ins that affect detail records may exceed the reasonable quantity edit, but cannot
exceed the on-hand balance in the detail record.
4. Document number (positions 30-43). Turn-ins that affect detail records, such as
DIFM, WRM, contract maintenance, and Supply Point, must contain the same document
number as used on the original issue request or due-out release.
5. Supplementary Data (positions 45-50). This is a multiple purpose field which will be
completed or left blank, based on the following:
a. When the item is being processed for manual shipment or force shipment, the ship-to
stock record account number must be entered.
b. When property is being turned-in from an activity assigned type organization code A
or B (Civil Engineer), a CE work order number must be entered.
c. When the property has been condemned by an inspector, positions 45-47 will be left
blank and TRM will be entered in positions 48-50.
d. For turn-ins that process against a Vehicle Maintenance organization, a vehicle
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    845


maintenance work order number and change code must be entered.
6. Transaction Exception (TEX) Code (position 51). TEX code authorization is as
follows:
a. TEX codes 2 and 4 are only authorized for exception processing (MICAP releases and
lateral support requirements) but are not intended to override normal release sequencing.
b. The use of TEX codes to bypass DIFM details is not authorized when the input
demand code is C, J, K, L, M, or I. Do not use TEX code 7 for NWRM turn-ins.
c. TEX Code 8. When an item has been issued manually, the TIN input must contain
TEX code 8 in position 51 and the ISU input must immediately follow the TIN input.
d. TEX code Y automatically builds and processes an input to delete a prime detail
record when the turn-in results in zero quantity on hand. (For a list of these details, see
AFH 23-123, Vol, 2 Pt 2, Ch 3, TEX Y.[xxx])
7. Interchangeability code (position 54). Enter interchangeability code I when the
inspector has determined the item being turned in is acceptable for the item issued, but
should not be linked in the applicable ISG. This code causes the turn-in to process and
clear DIFM detail records. Extreme care must be taken when processing a turn-in of a
DIFM item with interchangeability code I. If the input is processed in error and requires
reverse-post action, the RVPTIN program, NGV654, will establish the DIFM detail
under the stock number turned in, NOT the stock number on the original DIFM detail.
8. Project code (positions 57-59). This code may be used for turn-in against specific
DoD or Air Force projects.
a. For items originally issued for calibration, or repair and return (RAR), the turn-in
must contain the applicable RAR project code.
b. For SMAG items, PFMR codes will appear in transaction history records instead of
input project codes.
9. Shipment priority (positions 60-61). This field makes it possible to assign shipment
priority codes higher than would normally be assigned to any shipment.
10. Action taken codes (position 62). See Table 4.3 for complete details on action taken
codes.
a. Activity code C inputs must contain maintenance action codes for all repair cycle
items.
b. Activity code D inputs must contain action taken codes. The repair cycle record will
be updated as follows: 1) unserviceable TIN will reflect four days RCT; 2) serviceable
TIN for ERRCD XD1 will reflect six days RCT; and 3) serviceable TIN for ERRCD
XD2, or XF3 will reflect nine days RCT.
c. Activity code R, S, J, and X inputs will contain action codes when DIFM detail
records are affected.
d. All other inputs for repair cycle items will contain action codes if repair cycle data are
to be updated. Action taken codes will also be used when repair cycle data are not
affected (for example, items issued with demand code C).

e. Deficiency Report exhibits require action taken code C.
f. Serviceable returns from Supply Points, MSK/MRSP details, and all categories of
WRM will contain action taken code T.
11. Demand code (position 66). Leave this field blank on all turn-ins with the following
exceptions:
a. Turn-in of a repair cycle item that is not controlled on WRM, MSK, MRSP, Supply
Point, SPRAM, or DIFM details must reflect the demand code of the original issue
request; e.g., initial issue demand code I.
b. Turn-in for SPRAM activity code D will result in a 259 reject unless it contains
demand code I (when reducing or deleting authorized detail) or demand code R (when
requesting replacement item).
c. Leave blank when TEX codes A, B, D, F, H, or + are used. Demand code N is
automatically assigned to inputs containing these TEX codes.
12. Enter manual input or hour code as follows:
a. When an item is physically turned in to supply and processing of the TIN is delayed
for more than 1 duty day, enter a P in position 53 and the last three positions of the Julian
date (actual turn-in date) in positions 4-6 of the TIN input. This will ensure that repair
cycle data are updated based on the actual turn-in date rather than the current computer
processing date. This procedure applies regardless of the reason for delay (that is,
Degraded Operations, reject conditions, frozen item record, etc.).
b. If the input is done manually (TEX 4 or D) or if position 53 contains a P, enter the last
three positions of the Julian date (turn-in and/or DOR date) in positions 4-6. This date is
the due-out release date and/or MICAP termination date.
c. If the due-out UND is 1, /, or J (MICAP), enter the one-position hour code in position
7. (See Para 5.2.26 for the hour code table).
13. If the item being turned in is an unserviceable reliability improvement warranty
(RIW) item (Pacer Warrant, Project code 390), then enter the following:
a. Disposal authority or SEX code (position 7). Leave position 7 blank.
b. Quantity (positions 25-29). The quantity cannot be greater than 1.
c. Supplementary data (positions 45-50). Leave position 45 blank. Positions 46-50
must contain the item's serial number. (When the item serial number exceeds five
positions, enter the last five alpha-numeric characters of the serial number
d. Transaction exception (TEX) code (position 51). The TEX code must be 1, 6, +, A,
F, or blank. Use TEX code 1 only when directed to do so by the IM or the RIW monitor
at AFMC.
e. Action taken code (position 62). The action taken code must be 1-8. See Table 4.3
for complete details on action taken codes.
14. Credit code (position 52). Normally left blank. Credit codes make it possible to
override internal edits when a customer applies for credit returns. The fund’s manager
must approve the use of credit code Y on the AF Form 2005 before processing.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  847


15. Supply condition code (position 44). Supply condition codes A and D for
serviceable items, and E, F, G, or H for unserviceable items. For unserviceable
Deficiency Report, use supply condition code Q. For unserviceable FSG 3110 routing
identifier code S9I or SMS items, use supply condition code E. (Both codes D and H
will result in an unserviceable detail being added to the computer file, but when supply
condition code H is used, the maintenance action taken code must be 9.)
16. Last three positions of the work unit code (positions 63-65). When the TIN is for
RAMPS (Report Code F, G, 6, or 7) investment items (XD) action taken code 1-9 and
type organization code G, V, 7, 8, 9, or I, positions 63-65 must contain the last three
positions of the work unit code.
17. Controlled Item Code (position 81). If data classification code is left blank, normal
processing will take place. Use this code for a Turn in of unclassified property which
has classified data but cannot be removed for mechanical reasons. If the data
classification code is entered in position 81 of the TIN and a shipment is expected to be
output, a hand receipt will be output. The authorized data classification codes (controlled
item code) are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L O, S, and T.
18. JOCAS (Job Order Cost Accounting System) Control Number (positions 82 - 93). If
the organization’s control record JOCAS Flag is set to a Y (turned on), then a JOCAS
control number must be entered.
19. Supply Condition Code (position 44). When the DIFM detail (Disposition-
Response-Code) contains an S or 3 (dispose), and a TIN is processed with condition-
code F the condition-code will be changed to H. If the DIFM detail (Disposition-
Response-Code) contains a G (evacuate), and a TIN is processed with condition-code F
the condition-code will be changed to G. These edits will occur programmatically,
however in order to store a response code G in the DIFM detail, the following must
occur:
a. The disposition-response code of the requested AWP end-item DIFM detail will be
updated with an E (confirmed evacuation) on an XE9 input.
b. Cancel the related credit DIFM AWP due-out, and the ILS-S will programmatically
change the response code E to response code G on the XE9.

Notes:
1. Transient aircraft policy is outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec. 2C, Financial Management.
See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 to determine the correct AFHRD and command code
when turn-ins affect transient aircraft. If there is no DIFM detail on file, the mark-for
field of a turn-in for a RAMPS reportable item must contain the SRD, work unit code,
and command code as outlined above.
2. The SRD from the DIFM detail (203-SRD) will be used as the input SRD. If there is
no SRD in the DIFM detail, then a valid SRD must be entered.
   6.2.2. Processing Turn-In of Consumable Items.
   6.2.2.1. Purpose. To provide the format for processing consumable item returns (turn-ins) to
   the ILS-S. The section is provided in two parts. Table 6.3 is the input TIN transaction
   format for processing consumable item returns. Table 6.4 provides additional instruction
   detailing the Mark-For field of the TIN transaction.

Notes:
1. Tote Box/Hold Bay (positions 4-6). Data entered in this field will be printed
in the warehouse location field.
a. If the input is through the RPS/main system, and if line 2 contains action
phrase BIN XXXXX IN LOCATION XXXXXXXXXX, or if the input is
rejected, the tote box/hold bay will appear in positions 57-59 of the output DD
1348-1A.
b. If it is not practical to assign a tote box/hold bay before computer processing,
establish local procedures for controlling these assets.
2. Disposal authority or shipment exception (SEX) code (position 7). This is a
multiple purpose field which is used with other entries to direct or modify
processing.
a. The applicable disposal authority code G, H, or blank will be entered when
positions 48-50 contain TRM or position 62 contains action taken code 9. If this
field is left blank, the appropriate disposal authority code will be assigned by the
program. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for disposal authority codes.)
b. When the item is not condemned, leave this field blank or enter the
appropriate shipment exception code.
3. Quantity (positions 25-29). This field must be numeric values other than all
zeros.
a. When turn-ins do not affect detail records, the quantity cannot normally
exceed 999. However, if TEX code 5 is entered in position 51, the turn-in
quantity may be up to 99,999.
b. Turn-ins that affect detail records may exceed the reasonable quantity edit, but
cannot exceed the on-hand balance in the detail record.
4. Document number (positions 30-43). Turn-ins that affect detail records, such
as WRM, must contain the same document number as used on the original issue
request or due-out release.
5. Supplementary data (positions 45-50). This is a multiple purpose field which
will be completed or left blank, based on the following:
a. Enter the ship-to stock record account number when the item is being
processed for a manual shipment or force shipment.
b. Enter a Civil Engineer work order number when property is being turned in
from an activity assigned type organization code A or B (Civil Engineer).
c. Enter TRM in positions 48-50 when the property has been condemned by a
LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspector. Positions 45-47 will be left blank.
d. Enter a vehicle maintenance work order number and change code for those
turn-ins that process against a vehicle maintenance organization.
6. Project code (positions 57-59). Use this code for turn-in against specific DoD
or Air Force projects. Turn-in of items which were originally issued for
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                         851


calibration, RAR must contain the RAR project code that applies. PFMR codes
will appear in the transaction history records for SMAG items instead of input
project codes.
7. Shipment priority (positions 60-61). This field provides the capability for
assigning shipment priority codes higher than normally would be assigned by the
ILS-S. This code will be used on any shipment resulting from the turn-in.
8. Action taken code (position 62). Action taken code used for turn-in of
consumable items will be blank with the following exceptions:
a. Serviceable turn-in from detail records such as WRM will contain supply
action taken code T.
b. Action taken code U turn-ins will decrease the cumulative recurring demands
by the quantity turned in.
c. When the item turned in is a Deficiency Report exhibit, use supply condition
code Q and action taken code C.
9. Supplementary data (positions 45-50) and Project Code (positions 57-59). See
Table 6.4.
10. Transaction exception (TEX) code (position 51). The use of TEX codes can
have the following effects:
a. TEX codes 2, 4, A, B, D, F, H, and + are not authorized for returns of
expendable supplies.
b. TEX code Y automatically builds and processes an input to delete a prime
detail record when the turn-in results in zero quantity on hand.
c. Automatic shipment. Automatic shipment may be accomplished under the
following conditions:
1. Enter TEX code 7 in position 51 and the ship-to stock record account
number/DODAAC in positions 45-50 on the TIN input. When this procedure is
used, the shipment program will assign the shipping document number and a DD
1348-1A shipping document will be printed.
2. Enter TEX code 6 in position 51, the ship-to stock record account number
DODAAC in positions 45-50, and the shipping document number in positions 67-
80 in the TIN input. When this procedure is used, a DD 1348-1A shipping
document will not be printed. This transaction is not authorized for type
organization codes 7, 8, 9, A, B, G, I, or V.
d. TEX code 1. By entering TEX code 1 in position 51, you can suppress
unserviceable reporting and disposition action.
11. Credit code (position 52). Normally left blank. For organizational materiel
requiring processing to DLADS, use credit code N. Credit codes make it possible
to override internal edits when a customer applies for credit returns. Credit code
N is assigned when no credit is to be allowed, regardless of the stock position of
the item. Credit code Y is assigned when credit is allowed. The fund’s manager
 852                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


must approve the use of credit code Y on the AF Form 2005 before processing.
12. Mark-for data (positions 67-80). See Table 6.4.
13. Controlled Item Code (position 81). If controlled item code is left blank,
normal processing will take place. If the data classification code is entered in
position 81 of the TIN and a shipment document is produced, the ILS-S will also
produce a hand receipt. The authorized data classification codes (controlled item
code) are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, and T.
14. Job Order Cost Accounting System Control Number (JOCAS) (positions 82-
93). If the organization’s control record JOCAS Flag is set to a Y (turned on),
then a JOCAS control number must be entered.
15. Supply Condition Code (position 44). Unserviceable turn-ins will be
processed automatically for transfer to DLADS unless the input TEX code, item
record shipment exception (SEX) code or the critical item reporting code prevents
the action.
       6.2.2.2. The table below provides the format for the mark-for field for consumable item
       turn-in processing.

Notes:
1. Tote box/hold bay (positions 4-6). Data entered in this field will be printed in the
warehouse location field of the corresponding due-out release document. When property
is not due-out released, these data will appear in print positions 57-59 of line 2 on the
output management notice. If it is not practical to assign tote box/hold bay prior to
computer processing, establish local procedures for controlling these assets. When
processing TIN for COMSEC items, place the ship-to RID in this field.
2. Disposal authority or shipment exception (SEX) code (position 7). This is a multiple
purpose field used with other entries to direct or modify processing.
a. When positions 48-50 contain TRM or position 62 contains maintenance action taken
code 9, enter the applicable disposal authority code, G, H, or blank. If this field is left
blank, the program will assign the appropriate disposal authority code.
b. When the item is not condemned, leave this field blank or enter the appropriate
shipment exception code.
3. Quantity (positions 25-29). This field must be a positive value (greater than zero).
a. Turn-ins which do not affect detail records cannot contain a quantity greater than 9 for
cost Category I, greater than 99 for cost Category II, or greater than 999 for cost
Category III, unless TEX code 5 is entered in position 51.
b. Turn-ins that affect detail records may exceed the reasonable quantity edit, but cannot
exceed the on-hand balance in the detail record.
4. Document number (positions 30-43).
a. Turn-ins which affect detail records such as WRM, in-use, or contract maintenance
must contain the same document number as used on the issue request original or due-out
release. Other supply functions will normally use the original document number and not
assign document numbers for turn-in transactions.
b. For turn-in of organizational-owned non-EAID equipment requiring processing to
DLADS, use activity code P. For turn-ins from retail outlets, use activity code K. The
requester provides the org/shop code (positions 31-35). EAE enters the current Julian
date. The custodian provides the authorized/in-use detail document number (activity
856                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


code E) or EAE assigns next available serial number (activity code P) in positions 40-43.
5. Supplementary data (positions 45-50). This is a multiple purpose field that will be
completed or left blank, based on the following:
a. When the item is being processed for manual shipment or force shipment, or when a
vehicle is turned in with vehicle status code B, G, P, S, T, or U, enter the ship-to stock
record account number.
b. When property is being turned in from an activity assigned type organization code A
or B (Civil Engineer), enter a Civil Engineer work order number.
c. When the property has been condemned by a LRS/Materiel Management Activity
inspector, enter TRM in positions 48-50 and leave positions 45-47 blank.
d. When a vehicle is turned in for transfer to DLADS, enter TRM in positions 48-50 and
vehicle status code M in position 75 on the input TIN.
e. For those turn-ins that process against a vehicle maintenance organization operating
under the SBLC VIMS, enter a vehicle maintenance work order number and charge code.
6. Authority for Issue Flag (position 54). When activity code P is used to turn in an
equipment item, enter the authority for issue flag that was used on the original request for
issue.
7. Project code (positions 57-59). Use this field for turn-in against specific DoD or Air
Force projects.
a. For items originally issued for calibration, RAR, the turn-in must contain the
applicable RAR project code.
b. For SMAG items, PFMR codes will appear in the transaction history records instead
of input project codes.
8. Shipment priority (positions 60-61). This field provides the capability for assigning
shipment priority codes higher than normally would be computed by the program. Use
this code on any shipment resulting from the turn-in.
9. Action taken code (position 62). See Table 4.3. for the specific use of each type
action taken code.
a. Serviceable turn-ins require supply action taken code S, T, or U.
b. Unserviceable turn-ins require maintenance/supply action taken code 1 through 7, 9,
or R.
c. Deficiency Report exhibits, required maintenance action taken code C.
10. Credit code (position 52). Credit codes make it possible to override internal edits
when a customer applies for credit returns. The credit code is normally left blank.
Credit code N is assigned when no credit is to be allowed, regardless of the stock
position of the item. For turn-in of organizationally owned non-EAID equipment
requiring processing to DLADS, use credit code N. Credit code Y is assigned when
credit is allowed. The fund’s manager must approve the use of credit code Y on the AF
Form 2005 before processing
11. Mark-for data (positions 67-80). This is a multiple purpose field that will be used to
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    857


support other data elements and/or further modify processing.
a. When a TEX code is used to force a due-out release or process a manual due-out
release, shipment, or transfer to DLADS, enter a valid document number.
b. For a turn-in from an activity assigned type organization code A or B (Civil
Engineer), enter the facility number in positions 67-71 and the job order number in
positions 76-80 when applicable.
c. For vehicle turn-ins, enter the vehicle registration number in positions 67-74 (suffixed
with blanks when less than eight characters), an authorized vehicle status code (B, G, M,
P, Q, S, T, or U) in position 75, and vehicle replacement code A-H, J-M, or P-U in
position 76. When the vehicle status code is S or T, enter the gaining major command
code in positions 79-80. Leave positions 79-80 blank for all other vehicle status codes.
When vehicle status code M is used, positions 48-50 must contain TRM.
12. This information must be provided by requester. If the request is submitted by letter
or call-in, EAE personnel will enter data in required positions on AF Form 2005.
13. Supply condition code (position 44). EAE determines supply condition code from
the condition statement in block E. For unserviceable deficiency report items, use supply
condition code Q.
14. When an I is entered in position 54 of the TIN, automatic FCI interface occurs to
adjust the in-use authorized quantity. If the TIN quantity equals the total authorized
quantity, the in-use detail will be deleted.
15. If data classification code is left blank, normal processing will take place. If the data
classification code is entered in position 81 of the TIN and a shipment is expected to be
output, a hand receipt will be output also. The authorized data classification codes
(controlled item code) are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, and T.
16. If the organization’s control record JOCAS (Job Order Cost Accounting System)
Flag is set to a Y (turned on), then a JOCAS control number must be entered.
17. Use TEX code + to bypass EAID details for FOB turn-ins. Do not use TEX + for
COMSEC or Weapon assets. A Report of Survey must be accomplished for serialized
control assets that are ‘found on base’.
  6.2.4. Turn-In (TIN) Output Notices
      6.2.4.1. Purpose. To provide information about what documents are produced when a
      turn-in (TIN) transaction is processed in the ILS-S.
      6.2.4.2. Management Notice Outputs. Materiel turn-ins that increase the serviceable
      balance or create unserviceable details will result in the systematic production of various
      management notices. Additional item record data is printed below the management
      notice phrase for selected management notices. Table 6.7 shows what output notices are
      produced when turn-in transactions are successfully processed for given sets of
      conditions. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for management notices output format
      and distribution. A single input may generate more than one management notice. For
      example, successfully processed XD2 item turn-ins result in the creation of an
      unserviceable detail and an I012 (Processed Date, Transaction Serial Number, Stock
 858                                                      AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


        Awaiting Disposition) or I013 (Processed, Date, Transaction Serial Number, Hold For
        Shipment, Time) and an I035 (Depot Level Repair (XD) Item Not Shipped) MGT notice.
        6.2.4.3. Output Notice Exceptions. Generally, an output notice is produced for each
        turn-in (TIN) processed. There are two exceptions: 1) no output notice is produced when
        the entire quantity of serviceable turn-ins are input through the RPS/main system for due-
        out release; and 2) no output notice is produced when unserviceable turn-ins are input
        through the RPS/main system with TEX 6 or F in position 51 (manual transaction).
        6.2.4.4. Rejects. If the turn-in is rejected, line 2 of the reject notice will contain the
        applicable reject number and phrase. Line 3 will contain the current date and serial
        number of the last transaction processed before the reject. I012 (Processed Date,
        Transaction Serial Number, Stock Awaiting Disposition) or I013 (Processed, Date,
        Transaction Serial Number, Hold For Shipment, Time) and an I035 (Depot Level Repair
        (XD) Item Not Shipped) MGT notice.
        6.2.4.5. Output Destination. RPS/main system, input terminal, or warehouse terminal.

   Notes:
   1. Produce a 257 reject when an invalid condition is used for a given ERRCD; the turn-in program
   edits on the condition code first, then the action taken code.
   2. (XB/XF/XD) If activity code = M, S, U or W use action taken code 'T'. Produce a 250 reject
   when Action Taken code T is used for a DIFM Turn-in.
   3. Allow processing for action taken code 'C' if FSC = '3110' and RIC = 'S9I or SMS'.
   4. If activity code = 'D' use action taken code 'R'.
   5. For FSC 3110, ERRCD XB3 only condition code H can be used.

      6.3.1.2. Special-Type Item Transfers. Some items require special disposal processing.
             6.3.1.2.1. Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Items.            The transfer of
             unserviceable RIW assets to DLA usually does not occur. Exception: If the
             inventory manager determines the asset is to be transferred to DLA, enter the serial
             number in positions 46-50 of the TRM. It is strongly recommended the input contain
             authority code 7 and the name of the IM directing transfer in positions 65-78. Note:
             When AFMC/IM does not wish to have this asset returned under automatic shipment
             procedures, use TEX code 1 for the TIN input.
             6.3.1.2.2. Clothing Items. Serviceable, unserviceable and excess clothing items may
             be transferred to DLA. Clothing items transferred to DLA must be marked in a
             specific manner if the items are assigned Federal Supply Class (FSC) 8405 through
             8450 IAW DoD 4160.21-M.
             6.3.1.2.3. Cryptological Materiel. Stock Control personnel process transfers to DLA
             for both serviceable and unserviceable Cryptological materiel (FSC 5810/5811 and/or
             MMAC CA, CI, CS, or CY) according to established procedures as explained below.
                6.3.1.2.3.1. Cryptological Materiel Transfer Procedures. Cryptological materiel
                to DLADS, unclassified items with MMAC CA, CI, or CY, or FSC 5810/5811
                will be demilitarized prior to transferring. If required, remove all nameplates and
                markings identifying the item with a former classification. Once removed,
                nameplates and other removable identifying markings will be destroyed by
                burning, smelting, or mutilation. Identifying markings which have been etched or
                painted on the item will be obliterated by filing or scraping as appropriate to
                remove the markings. When preparing the documentation for the transfer of
                Cryptological materiel to DLADS do not furnish the former classified name of
                the item. Instead, LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel will furnish the
                item nomenclature and a commercial description (which does not refer to NSA or
                a Cryptological application). Additionally, LRS/Materiel Management Activity
                personnel will enter “NO” in Block C of the DD 1348-1A transfer (A5J)
                document unless the item requires demilitarization. See DoD 4160.28M-1 Vol 2,
                Defense Demilitarization: Demilitarization Coding for more information
862                                                  AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         concerning the demilitarization of Cryptological items. See for a list of standard
         DoD demilitarization codes.
      6.3.1.2.4. Non-Saleable Items. Non-saleable property based on restrictions by law or
      regulations is such property as herbicide orange, materiel with a radioactive
      characteristic, etc. DLA is responsible for the disposition of non-saleable (non-
      restricted) materiel except where sales are prohibited by law or military regulations.
      This restriction is normally based upon future sales value of the materiel. For non-
      saleable (restricted) materiel, the military service(s) will be responsible for the
      disposition of all items identified as non-saleable when the sale or disposal of such
      items is restricted by law or by military regulations. Note:         The installation
      commander will remain responsible for the collection and disposal of refuse and
      trash.
      6.3.1.2.5. Critical Safety Item (CSI). Historical maintenance data must accompany
      reparable CSI items whenever possible for all base transfers to DLADS. CSI materiel
      which lacks required supporting documentation will be mutilated prior to being
      transferred to DLADS. Note: DLADS will mutilate CSI items not accompanied by
      an AFTO Form 95 or other historical maintenance record if the items have not
      already been mutilated. The term “AFTO Form 95 Required” will be printed on all
      output shipments or transfer documents requiring supporting historical maintenance
      data. The LRS/Materiel Management activity inspector should contact maintenance
      when this phrase is printed on serialized reparable items and no maintenance
      documentation is available.
      6.3.1.2.6. Items Without Non-National Stock Number (Non-NSN) Items. All
      transfers to DLADS for non-NSN items will have a description of the materiel
      attached to, or annotated on the disposal document. A DD 1348-6 (Non-NSN
      Requisition) may be used if available, or the description may be provided to DLADS
      using a method agreed upon by the supported DLADS and the LRS/Materiel
      Management activity. Scrap materiel or materiel batched by lot number for disposal is
      excluded from the description requirement.
      6.3.1.2.7. Unserviceable Items. See Para 5.9.2 or condition code change (FCC)
      transactions and the procedures for transferring expendable assets in stock which are
      identified as being unserviceable. Unserviceable expendable assets will be
      transferred to DLADS as follows:
         6.3.1.2.7.1. Condemned expendable (XB3) items. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 6C,
         Disposal and Demilitarization for the procedures for the receipt of XB3 assets
         determined to be condemned by a LRS/Materiel Management activity inspector.
         6.3.1.2.7.2. Unserviceable equipment (NF2) items. Equipment items (ERRCD
         equals NF2) with an extended dollar value of less than $100 will be transferred to
         DLADS.
         6.3.1.2.7.3. Unserviceable reparable (XD*/XF*) items.       Reparable items
         (ERRCD equals XD*/XF*)with a reparable destination/disposition code of “DSP”
         will be transferred to DLADS.
         6.3.1.2.7.4. Unserviceable field reparable (XF3) items containing budget code 8.
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              863


           Field reparable (ERRCD equals XF3) items containing budget code 8, and a
           reparable destination/disposition code unequal to “RPT”, will be transferred to
           DLADS.
           6.3.1.2.7.5. Unserviceable field reparable (XF3) items containing budget code 9.
           Field reparable (ERRCD equals XF3) items containing budget code 9, and an
           extended dollar value of less than $100 will be transferred to DLADS.
        6.3.1.2.8. Condemned Radioactive Equipment Items. Certain radioactive assets
        cannot be accepted by DLA and are to be disposed of according to AFI 40-201,
        Managing Radioactive Materials In The Us Air Force as radioactive waste.
        Inspection personnel will use Federal Standard 313, Material Safety Data,
        Transportation Data, And Disposal Data, For Hazardous Materials Furnished To
        Government Activities to identify items that may contain hazardous/radioactive
        material. At the end of each month, an ILS-S utility program produces a listing
        containing all stock classes from Table I and all stock groups listed in Table II. See
        AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5C, Physical Asset Management for additional information
        about how to identify radioactive items. The following actions required:
           6.3.1.2.8.1. Disposal Shipment Document Preparation. The A5J document
           output by the ILS-S is designed to transfer the radioactive waste materiel to the
           DLA. However, radioactive waste must be shipped to a radioactive waste
           disposal point IAW AFI 40-201. Therefore, Distribution personnel must 1) sign
           the disposal (A5J) output document (created by the condemnation turn-in (TIN)
           transaction) in Block 7, and 2) prepare an offline (handscribed or typed) DD
           1348-1A shipping document. The offline shipping document must contain the
           ship-to address in block B and must include the following statement: The items
           and quantities listed on this document have been downgraded to radioactive waste
           and transferred to the LRS, Materiel Management or Transportation Activity
           officer for shipment to the radioactive waste disposal point according to AFI 40-
           201.
           6.3.1.2.8.2. Disposal Shipment Document Processing. The materiel and the
           offline shipping document will be forwarded to the LRS/transportation activity
           function for processing and disposal. LRS/transportation activity personnel will
           sign and return one copy of the offline DD 1348-1A to Distribution personnel.
           Distribution personnel will then attach the returned offline DD 1348-1A to the
           signed A5J and send both documents to Document Control for filing. Note: See
           40-201 for detailed procedures for packaging, sampling, handling, and shipment
           requests.
        6.3.1.2.9. Disposal of Industrial Machinery Services (IMS) Items. When disposal
        authority is received from the IMS, personnel process the transfer of defense
        industrial plant equipment items to DLADS using manual processing and type IMS
        DIRECTED into block AA of the DD 1348-1A. Personnel send the following to
        DLADS: 1) copies of the DD 1342, DoD Property Record the IMS letter authorizing
        disposal, 3) the DD 1348-1A, and 4) the Defense Industrial Plant Equipment
        property.
864                                                 AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


      6.3.1.2.10. Typewriters. When it is necessary to transfer typewriters to DLADS,
      Inspection personnel should handwrite the following data (if available) on the DD
      1348-1A: make, model, type (standard, silent, noiseless, portable, manual, or
      electric), carriage width, type face, and serial number. These data may be entered on
      the reverse of the DD 1348-1A transfer (A5J) document when sufficient space is not
      available on the front of the form. Note: The provisions of this paragraph do not
      apply to bookkeeping, billing, or teletype machines.
      6.3.1.2.11. Hazardous Material. To comply Air Force and DoD policy directives,
      Transfer to DLA (DD 1348-1A) documents for hazardous material or waste require
      additional information. See block 27 of the A5J output format in Para 6.3.2 for the
      annotations required to transfer hazardous material to DLADS.
         6.3.1.2.11.1. Hazardous property entered on TRIC A5J DD 1348-1A. Inspection
         personnel manually enter information in blocks 26-27 of the A5J DD 1348-1A
         (Transfer to DLADS) IAW Para 6.3.2 A DD 1348-6 may be used if available, or
         the description may be provided to DLADS using a method agreed upon by the
         supported DLADS and materiel management activities.
         6.3.1.2.11.2. Provide chemical names. If hazardous property is for non-stock
         listed (L/P) numbers, Inspection personnel provide chemical names of hazardous
         contaminants, and noun names of non-hazardous contaminants.
         6.3.1.2.11.3. Provide amount of contaminants. Inspection personnel also state the
         amount of hazardous and non-hazardous contaminants as determined by user's
         knowledge or testing of the item. This amount is expressed in a range of content
         by percentage or parts per million, as applicable.
         6.3.1.2.11.4. Certificate for hazardous property. DoD 4160.21-M requires special
         processing for hazardous material being turned in to DLADS. Whenever
         hazardous material packed in containers marked HAZARDOUS is turned in for
         disposal, the reporting activity will provide DLADS a certificate (in triplicate)
         stating the condition and reliability of the container. Because LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity personnel do not have the expertise to accurately certify the
         reliability of containers, they take the following steps to obtain this certificate
         from the Cargo Movement:
             6.3.1.2.11.4.1. Property segregated. Segregate hazardous material requiring
             certification from other property being taken to DLADS.
             6.3.1.2.11.4.2. Inspection time arranged. Inspection and transportation
             personnel will arrange a mutually agreeable inspection time. Upon conclusion
             of their inspection, transportation personnel shall complete a DD 1387-2,
             Special Handling Data/Certification and attach it to the container.
             6.3.1.2.11.4.3. Verification.    Inspection personnel verify the identity,
             quantity, and condition of the materiel. They then sign or stamp and date
             block 27of the DD 1348-1A. Forward the property and related documentation
             to Delivery for processing to the DLADS.
         6.3.1.2.11.5. Physical Property Custody. DoD policy stipulates that a base may
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 865


           retain physical custody of hazardous material while transferring accountability to
           DLA. However, DLADS may refuse certain categories of property because of the
           lack of special handling equipment, inadequate storage facilities, or conflicting
           disposal instructions. If any of the above situations occur, use the following
           procedures to maintain accountability until final disposition is made:
               6.3.1.2.11.5.1. Hazardous Material Acceptance Refusal. When DLADS
               refuses acceptance of hazardous material, Documented Cargo personnel return
               the property to the appropriate LRS/Materiel Management Activity storage
               area (preferably segregated from normal base stocks) and provide the DD
               1348-1A (A5J) transfer document to Inspection. Inspection personnel prepare
               a condition change (FCC) transaction to change the supply condition of the
               item to condition code J (suspended in stock). The condition change (FCC)
               transaction and the document control copy of the DD 1348-1A (A5J) transfer
               document is sent to Document Control. Document Control personnel will
               reverse-post (RVP) the transfer (A5J) document and process the condition
               change (FCC) transaction to suspend the materiel in stock. Processing the
               FCC transaction will place the disposal quantity on a ILS-S unserviceable
               detail record. Document Control will file the document control copy of the
               DD 1348-1A transfer (A5J) document. Note: DLADS should be contacted
               by LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel to resolve this situation.
               MAJCOM, AFMC, or DLA activities will be contacted when necessary to
               resolve the situation.
               6.3.1.2.11.5.2. Hazardous Material Accountability Acceptance. In some
               instances, DLADS may accept accountability for hazardous material but
               cannot accept physical custody of the materiel. When DLADS accepts
               accountability, but refuses physical custody of hazardous material, DLADS
               personnel sign for the property on copy one of the DD 1348-1A transfer (A5J)
               document. Central Storage personnel will return the hazardous material to an
               appropriate storage area properly tagged and identified as belonging to
               DLADS. The document control copy of the DD 1348-1A transfer (A5J)
               document will be sent to Document Control. Central Storage will retain copy
               two (2) and three (3) of the DD 1348-1A in a jacket file or similar system to
               account for the hazardous material until DLA is able to accept custody.
        6.3.1.2.12. Vehicles. To transfer unserviceable vehicles to DLADS, LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity personnel will reformat the ILS-S-generated transfer to DLA
        input (TRM) transaction to contain TEX L in position 51, disposal authority code G
        or H in position 62, the unserviceable detail document number in positions 65-78, the
        first two positions of the vehicle registration number in positions 79-80, and the last 6
        positions in 45-50.
           6.3.1.2.12.1. Transfer procedures. When directed to transfer a Registered
           Equipment Management (REM) vehicle, the REM manager will first notify the
           equipment custodian and obtain two copies of the vehicle historical record. REM
           vehicles are reported to the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS),
           and are identified in the ILS-S by ERRCD ND5 or NF5. Note: The vehicle
           historical record is not required for non-REM vehicles transferred to DLA.

               6.3.1.2.12.2. Installation Vehicle Fleet Manager (VFM) Responsibilities. The
               VFM will advise Freight, LRS/transportation activity, of the weight, dimensions,
               destination, in-place date, and estimated ready date of the vehicle. Next, the VFM
               will prepare AF Form 2005 Turn-in (TIN) documentation. Ensure the turn-in
               contains the correct vehicle status code. For vehicle transfers to DLADS, use
               vehicle status code “M.” Internal programs use the vehicle status code to
               determine whether the vehicle is automatically shipped, transferred to DLADS, or
               held in stock. The VFM must review the DD 1348-1A transfer document for
               correctness. The vehicle registration number, disposal authority code, and any
               additional data required by DLADS (description) are mandatory and must be hand
               scribed on the DD 1348-1A.
               6.3.1.2.12.3. Vehicle and Transfer Document Processing. The VFM will ensure
               the document control copy of the DD 1348-1A is provided to Document Control.
               Place the original copy of the vehicle historical record in the vehicle records
               jacket and secure it in the vehicle. Note: Vehicles do not have to move
               physically through LRS/Materiel Management Activity during the turn-in and
               shipment process. See AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5E, Sec Document Control and
               Detail Records for complete information.
           6.3.1.2.13. Shipping and Storage Containers (FSC 8145). When shipping and
           storage containers in FSC 8145 are transferred to DLADS, the LRS/Materiel
           Management activity inspector will ensure the containers are empty, annotate the DD
           1348-1A transfer (A5J) document with the statement: I CERTIFY THAT THE
           CONTAINERS LISTED HEREON ARE EMPTY. Lastly, the LRS/Materiel
           Management activity inspector will sign the disposal document. See DoD 4160.21-M
           for more information on disposal of shipping and storage containers.
   6.3.2. Transfer To DLADS (TRM) Transaction.
        6.3.2.1. Purpose. To initiate the transfer of materiel to DLA Disposition Services and
        update affected ILS-S records. Transfer (TRM) transactions may be created during File
        Status or Forced Excess (FEX) review input processing. When the determination to
        transfer materiel to DLADS is approved or directed by LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity, TRM is re-input to produce DD Form 1348-1A A5J transfer document.
        6.3.2.2. Input Restrictions. None.
        6.3.2.3. Output. RPS/main system or terminal.

     6.3.4. Document Flow For Transfer To DLADS (A5J) Document (DD 1348-1a)
     Delivered Through LRS/Materiel Management Activity Channels.
       6.3.4.1. Purpose. To explain the document flow and processing requirements for DD
       1348-1A Transfer to DLADS document, for property transferred through LRS/Materiel
       Management Activity channels.
       6.3.4.2. Input/Output Requirements.
          6.3.4.2.1. Transfer to DLADS (TRM) input transactions are processed through
          authorized input terminals or the main reader.
          6.3.4.2.2. Transfer to DLADS (A5J) Document Destination. The ILS-S, upon input
          transfer (TRM) processing, directs the DD 1348-1A transfer document (A5J) to either
          the input terminal, warehouse terminal, or the applicable satellite terminal. Note:
          Transfer documents for terminals are printed on the main printer. Transfer
872                                                     AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


         documents created on warehouse terminals apply if the items are held on ILS-S
         unserviceable detail records containing a valid warehouse location. Transfer
         documents directed from satellite accounts (A1–A9) will be returned to the satellite
         input terminal. All other output transfer documents will be printed on the main RPS
         printer.
      6.3.4.3. Transfer Document (DD 1348-1A) Distribution. If the DD 1348-1A transfer
      document contains demilitarization codes F or G forward all copies of the DD 1348-1A
      transfer document to Inspection for processing. All other transfer document will be
      forwarded to Central Storage personnel.
      6.3.4.4. Central Storage Responsibilities. After receiving the DD 1348-1A transfer
      document, Central Storage personnel perform a warehouse validation if line 21 of the DD
      1348-1A document indicates the transfer to DLADS reduced the item record serviceable
      balance to zero (0). Subsequently, Central Storage personnel will select the transferred
      materiel, sign and date line 26 of the DD 1348-1A transfer document, and forward the
      materiel and transfer document to Inspection personnel.
      6.3.4.5. Inspection Section Responsibilities. After receiving the DD 1348-1A transfer
      document from Central Storage personnel, Inspection personnel will determine what
      action is required based upon the demilitarization code. If the transferred materiel meets
      established low-dollar value requirements, Inspection will downgrade the transferred
      materiel to scrap.
         6.3.4.5.1. Hazardous Materiel Transfer Requirements. DoD 4160.21-M requires
         special handling of hazardous material transferring to DLADS. Whenever hazardous
         material packed in the container marked HAZARDOUS is turned in for disposal, the
         reporting activity will provide the servicing DLADS a certificate (in triplicate) as to
         the true condition and reliability of the container. Note: LRS/Materiel Management
         personnel do not have the expertise to accurately certify container reliability.
         Therefore, the following actions must be taken to obtain a container certificate from
         either the LRS/transportation activity, or the most knowledgeable individual from the
         submitting organization.
         6.3.4.5.2. Segregate hazardous material. Segregate hazardous material requiring the
         certificate from other property being taken to DLADS.
         6.3.4.5.3. Perform container reliability inspection. Contact the Cargo Movement and
         an individual from the using organization and arrange a mutually agreeable time to
         inspect and certify the materiel and container. Upon conclusion of the inspection,
         Cargo Movement personnel or the individual from the using organization will
         complete a certificate (in triplicate) as to the true condition and reliability of the
         container.
         6.3.4.5.4. Distribute transfer document. After the above steps have been completed,
         verify the identity, quantity, and condition of the materiel and sign or stamp and date
         copies one through three of the DD 1348-1A (line 30). Send the property and the
         related documentation to Documented Cargo for processing to the DLADS.
         6.3.4.5.5. Hazardous Non-stock Listed (Non-NSN) Item Transfers. If transferred
         materiel is considered non-stock listed (L/P numbers) and hazardous, Inspection
AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  873


        personnel will provide the chemical name of the hazardous contaminants and the
        common name of the non-hazardous contaminants. Inspection personnel will also
        provide the amount of hazardous and non- hazardous contaminants based upon the
        user's knowledge or testing of the materiel by percentage or parts per million.
        Inspection personnel will retrieve the ILS-S-generated transfer document and
        manually enter this information on the DD 1348-1A transfer document. See Para
        6.3.3 for details about the Transfer document (A5J) output.
     6.3.4.6. Documented Cargo Responsibilities. Pick-up and Delivery personnel will
     provide all copies of the DD 1348-1A transfer document and materiel to DLADS.
     DLADS will sign/stamp and date the DD 1348-1A output transfer document and return it
     to Pick-up and Delivery personnel. Note: When demilitarization must be performed
     before the physical transfer of hazardous material to DLADS, Copy Two (2) of the DD
     1348-1A transfer document will be used to hand receipt property to the function doing
     the demilitarization. For each transfer, DLADS retains all TRANS copies of the DD
     1348-1A transfer document.
     6.3.4.7. Document Control Responsibilities. The Document Control copy of the DD
     1348-1A transfer document (returned by Documented Cargo) will be used to clear the
     document control image (DCC) suspense. Document Control personnel will file the
     document after quality control of the source document has been performed.
     6.3.4.8. DLADS Signed Copy Exclusions. Transfers to DLADS may include a
     demilitarization certificate with the word DESTROYED or WASTE printed on the DD
     1348-1A. In this circumstance, the demilitarization certificate is treated as a valid receipt
     from DLADS.         Additionally, transfers to DLADS may also include a downgrade
     certificate signed or stamped by Inspection personnel. In this circumstance, the
     downgrade certificate is considered a valid receipt from DLADS. No DLADS signature
     or signature copy of the DD 1348-1A transfer document is required for Document
     Control filing.
  6.3.5. Processing Procedures For ICP-Directed Transfers To DLADS.
     6.3.5.1. Purpose. To explain disposal authority criteria and ILS-S processing of ICP-
     directed transfers of materiel to DLADS.
     6.3.5.2. Wholesale-Directed Transfers to DLADS Transactions. ICP-directed transfers
     to DLADS may be initiated by AFMC, Contractor, DLA, GSA, and other Service ICPs.
     Different transactions are used by the ICPs to initiate the transfer actions. See Para 6.3.7
     for detailed information regarding the specific transactions used depending upon the
     disposal authority.
     6.3.5.3. AFMC and Contractor ICP-Directed Transfers. AFMC and Contractor ICP-
     directed transfers of materiel to DLA Disposition Services are initiated via redistribution
     order (A2*) and referral order (A4*) transactions. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for the
     format of A2*/A4* transactions. These transactions are used to direct transfer of either
     serviceable or unserviceable materiel to DLADS vs. Wholesale-directed transfers to
     DLADS may be identified in the ILS-S by “YDISPL” located in positions 45-50 of the
     A2*/A4* transfer transactions. Note: Forward all wholesale-directed redistribution
     order (A2*) or referral order (A4*) transactions containing an “E” or “5” in the third
 874                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       position of the document identifier field (i.e., A2E, A45) to AFMC SCM R Stock Control
       Activity. These types of transactions are considered controlled exceptions. These
       transactions will be processed on a manual basis as described in AFMAN 23-122, Ch 2
       Sec 2E, Degraded Operations.
       6.3.5.4. Transfer of Serviceable Assets. Redistribution order (A2*) and referral order
       (A4*) transactions for wholesale-directed transfer of serviceable items to DLADS are
       processed in the ILS-S applicable to established disposal authority criteria. ICP-directed
       transfers that are processed in the ILS-S normally result in automatic transfers of materiel
       to DLADS. Bases can suppress automatic transfers to DLADS by setting a flag on their
       base constants record. When the flag is set, the ILS-S produces transfer to DLADS input
       (TRM) notices. Also note items with Weapon System Details are not authorized for
       transfer to DLADS. Weapon System Details are assigned to items that can be linked
       directly to weapon systems and to other high priority items.
       6.3.5.5. Transfer of Unserviceable Assets. A ICP-directed transfer of an unserviceable
       item to DLADS is provided through the redistribution order (A2*) transaction. Upon
       input, the ILS-S locates and decreases/deletes the unserviceable detail record. Note: No
       disposal authority criteria are applied to unserviceable transfers to DLA Disposition
       Services.
       6.3.5.6. DLA, GSA, and Other Service-Directed Transfers. ICP-directed transfers
       (disposals) initiated by DLA, GSA, and other Service ICPs are communicated to bases
       via FTR transactions with excess status “TC” The ILS-S criteria for honoring FTRs with
       excess status code TC are detailed in Table 6.14.

Notes:
1. ERL = RO + (DDR * 730)
2. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure for detailed information about weapon
system item retention rules.
3. Computed retention periods are based upon the DATE-SPC-5-ASSIGNED and the
item MIC. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure for details about item retention
period computations. Additional FTR Processing Information. The following
paragraphs provide additional information about ILS-S FTR processing actions when
FTR materiel transfer transactions are honored and denied. Processing Honored FTRs.
Whenever an FTR with excess status TC is processed in the ILS-S; the system performs
a requirements computation to determine if the base excess asset position has changed
since the excess was reported. When the criteria in Table 6.11 have been met and the
requirements computation indicates no change in the base excess asset position, FTRs
are honored by the ILS-S. When the FTR is honored, the system outputs an A5J
shipping document. Each honored FTR is also documented via appropriate transaction
history records. See AFH 23-123 Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for information about transaction
history details.
      6.3.5.7. Processing Denied FTRs. If the requirements computation indicates the base
      excess asset position has changed such that the FTR can no longer be fully honored, the
      system produces and transmits a Report of Customer Excess Cancellation (FTC)
      transaction to the ICP to advise that the material transfer order was totally or partially
      denied. At the time the FTC is produced, the ILS-S deletes the excess detail record and
      creates the appropriate transaction history record.
  6.3.6. Scrap Classification And Segregation Guide.
      6.3.6.1. Purpose. To provide the procedures and segregation codes required for scrap
      classification and segregation.
      6.3.6.2. Scrap Classification and Segregation Guide. Reference Table 6.12 to assist with
      identification and segregation of scrap materiel. Note:            DLADS has the final
      responsibility for scrap segregation. To simplify the segregation process, materiel should
      be segregated as accumulated by base organizations if possible. This is due to the fact
      that materiel segregation is normally easier to perform at the scrap collection point rather
      than DLADS. This is especially true for scrap metal. Contamination or mixing of
      several grades of scrap results in increased processing costs and/or reduced sales. Note:
      Trash and refuse are never delivered to DLADS.
 876                                                       AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       6.3.6.3. DLADS should determine the degree of segregation required, assist in the
       identification of metals not easily identified, and provide receptacles (barrels, containers,
       etc.) to be placed at base collection points.

  6.3.7. Disposal Authority Codes.
     6.3.7.1. Purpose. To provide the list of and an explanation of each Disposal Authority
     Code used on transfers to DLA Disposition Services.
     6.3.7.2. Disposal Metrics. Disposal authority codes provide AF/A4LM with meaningful
     disposal data for analysis of Air Force property transfers to DLA Disposition Services.
     Disposal data is extracted from the ILS-S M32 report, “Stratification of DLA Disposition
     Services Transfers.” The M32 results are used to validate and/or modify Air Force
     excess materiel retention policies.
     6.3.7.3. Disposal Authority Codes. The disposal authority codes listed below are edited
     by the ILS-S for validity and stored in the transaction history record. Disposal authority
     codes are used on Transfer to DLA Disposition Services (TRM) transactions to justify the
     transfer of the materiel. When the TRM transaction disposal authority code does not pass
     ILS-S edits or is blank on input, a 307 reject will be produced. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
     Pt 2, Ch 7 for reject management.

   10.2.5. Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR) - Format Two
         10.2.5.1. Purpose. Depending on the type phrase used, this input will create or delete a
         serialized control detail (249 record), or an in-use serialized control (250 record), or will
         modify either one in preparation for subsequent inline processing. This format is to be
         used by the base-level user to modify records of serialized weapons at or received by
         his/her base. Up to ten (10) serial numbers may be processed with a single input.
         Note: This input is used to identify to the SBSS a specific serialized control detail
         document number and serial number for processing. After processing the DSR, and prior
         to processing the subsequent transaction, it is imperative that only those serialized details
         just flagged with DSR have the appropriate action code. Example: When using DSR to
         flag one or more 250 records for an inventory adjustment (type phrase - IADDTL), only
         those 250 records being adjusted may have a 250-ACTION-CODE of ‘A’ loaded. If any
         other records have this action code loaded, the program will produce a 616 reject. When
         processing the entire balance of a selected detail (250 record), or warehouse balance (249
         record), this input is not required.
         10.2.5.2. Input Restrictions. None.
         10.2.5.3. Output. Creates, modifies or deletes selected serialized control detail (249
         record) or in-use serialized control (250 record). No transaction history (901 record) is
         written by this transaction.

Notes:
1. Enter the document number as it appears on the serialized control detail (249 record)
or the in-use serialized control (250 record). When using DSR to load/create a serialized
control detail (249 record) use the MILSTRIP requisition number of the receipt
document or 99S input due-in detail. When creating an in-use serialized control (250
record) for RVP, use the stock number and document number being reverse-posted. The
MILSTRIP document number must be proceeded by the stock record account number
(examples FE420891510025, FB420892650099).
2. The suffix code is only used to identify a partial receipt to the computer. If your
document number includes a suffix code, it must be input or the program will reject.
Otherwise, leave this field blank.
3. Left justified, alpha/numeric. Do not use spaces prior to serial number. Enter up to
ten (10) separate serial numbers. Use the serial number entry fields sequentially, i.e., if
you have three serial numbers to process, use input entry fields 1, 2, and 3 - not 1, 4, and
7. If your serial number’s first position is a zero, enter a zero. For example, serial
number 012345 would read 012345(b)(b)(b)(b)(b) where (b) equals a blank.
4. Enter your base Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) in positions 69-74. For type
account code ‘E’, enter FE then the address of your account. If the type account code is
‘B’, then enter FB. EXAMPLE: FE4659 or FB4300.
5. For FED processing, use Type Phrase ‘SHIPPED’.
6. The input NSN must be loaded with a serialized report code of ‘A’ or program will
produce a 619 reject.

Code
05         Error Message: A small arms record exists on the Component Registry
           master file, but the reporting activity did not submit E reconciliation record.
           Solution: Verify active/inactive records. If the weapon is on active file,
           return the error transaction to the Component Registry with the required
           transaction code in position 7 to indicate that the Component Registry is
           correct. This action will remove the reject suspense and stop any follow-up
           action.
07         Error Message: Identifies a reconciliation request submitted to the
           Component Registry that shows another reporting activity as the owner. The
 928                                                   AFH23-123V2PT1 8 AUGUST 2013


       reject is included in the small arms record reject suspense file, which must be
       cleared to complete the reconciliation. Solution: Verify active/inactive
       records.
       a. If the document is a receipt, then request the shipping activity to submit
       required shipment transactions and resubmit error transaction with an R in
       position 7 and other pertinent data punched as required to post to master file
       and remove the reject suspense.
       b. If the document is not a receipt of a shipment and the weapon is physically
       on hand as reported, then take the necessary action outlined for duplicate
       serial numbers within the same NSN.
08     Error Message: Reflects confirmation that the Component Registry had
       added a serial number as a result of a reconciliation E transaction processed.
       No prior receipt of a transaction record received by the Component Registry.
       Solution: No action required. The reconciliation will be recorded in the next
       Component Registry master file update as an initial registration. The number
       of code 8 records posted to the Component Registry master file will be
       identified as summary information to the activity being reconciled.

       Solution: Notify reporting activity of the error condition so that it can correct
       its files. Correct and resubmit transaction.
2B     Error Message: Serial number contains blanks. Solution: Notify reporting
       activity of the error and request a corrected transaction be submitted.
2C     Error Message: Transaction code invalid. Solution: Correct and resubmit
       transaction.
2D     Error Message: Unmatched stock number. Solution:
       a. If the stock number is not reportable, then notify the reporting units to
       discontinue reporting for this stock number.
       b. If the stock number is wrong, then notify the reporting activity of the error
       and request them to submit a corrected transaction
       c. If the stock number is valid and relevant, then prepare and submit
       transaction H to the computer.
2F     Error Message: Document number date incorrect. Solution: Verify, correct,
       and resubmit transaction.

           Solution: Shipping activity must verify and submit required shipment
           transactions to enable receipt to post to Component Registry.
3L         Error Message: Input transaction is incompatible with master file. Solution:
           Compare the rejected transaction against the master file and then make the
           input transaction (position 7) compatible; for example, S transaction on the
           master file will accept R transaction only.
3M         Error Message: Duplicate on serial number, stock number, and transaction
           code. Solution: Request printout from the computer by stock number and
           serial number (transaction code 3). Check the transaction to see if it is an
           exact duplicate. If it is not, correct and resubmit the transaction.
3U         Error Message: NSN and weapons serial number duplicate another weapon
           on the master file. Solution:
           a. If either the NSN (positions 8-22) or the serial number (positions 57-67) of
           the weapon are incorrect, then resubmit a correct transaction. b. If the NSN
           and serial number are correct and the weapon was received from the activity
           shown in the master file, then submit receipt R transaction to the Component
           Registry. c. If the NSN and serial number are correct, and the weapon was
           not received from the activity shown on the master file, then follow the
           actions for duplicate serial numbers with same NSN.

Notes:
1. Document number of 249 or 250 serial number record. Mandatory field.
Caution when using load option (L) as no edits are made on the input
document number. If an invalid or blank document number is entered it will
be accepted. Serialized control detail (249 record): The MILSTRIP
document number must be proceeded by the stock record account number
(examples FE420871050025, FB420871050099). In-Use-Serialized-Control
(250 record): Example E727ME00000027).
2. Left justified, alpha/numeric. Do not use spaces or zeros prior to the
serial number. If your serial number’s first position is a zero, enter a zero.
For example, serial number 012345 would read 012345(b)(b)(b)(b)(b) where
(b) equals a blank.
3. C = Change, L = Load, D = Delete.
4. Place an “X” in the appropriate record type (249 or 250) field.
5. A DSA for weapons and an XHA for COMSEC items are created by
program control when an XS1 is processed.

        10.2.13.1. Purpose. To provide a record used by AFMC Cryptological System Activity
        to return rejects to reporting bases for correction. The reject record is in the same format
        as the XHA except the DIC in positions 1-3 is XHB, positions 25-29 contain the date
        (YYDDD) the XHA was rejected by AFEMS, and positions 72-75 identify the error by
        two-position error codes. COMSEC error notification codes are outlined in Para 10.2.17
        Correct the errors and change the DIC to XHA and positions 4-6 to FNL for type
        accounts B and t E assets. DIC XHA with FNL in positions 4-6 will be placed in the
        same file as the D24 for transmission to AFEMS (C001).

Notes:
1. Routing Identifier code of the activity to receive the reject.
2. Two-digit error notification codes are used. Up to two separate errors can be
identified on each record.
   10.2.14. COMSEC Serialized Control Input (XHB) - Format Two.
         10.2.14.1. Purpose. Depending on the type phrase used, this input will create or delete a
         serialized control detail (249 record) or an in-use serialized control (250 record), or will
         modify either one in preparation for subsequent inline processing. This format is to be
         used by the base level user to modify records of serialized COMSEC assets at or received
         by his/her base. Up to ten (10) serial numbers may be processed with a single input.
         Note:     This input is used to identify to the SBSS a specific serialized control detail
         document number and serial number for processing. After processing the XHB, and prior
         to processing the subsequent transaction, it is imperative that only those serialized details
         just flagged with XHB have the appropriate action code. EXAMPLE: When using XHB
         to flag one or more 250 records for an inventory adjustment (type phrase - IADDTL),
         only those 250 records being adjusted may have a 250-ACTION-CODE of ‘A’ loaded. If
         any other records have this action code loaded, the program will produce a 616 reject.
         When processing the entire balance of a selected detail (250 record), or warehouse
         balance (249 record), this input is not required.
         10.2.14.2. Input Restrictions. None.
         10.2.14.3. Output. Creates, modifies or deletes selected serialized control detail (249
         record) or in-use serialized control (250 record). No transaction history (901 record) is
         written by this transaction.

Notes:
1. Enter the document number as it appears on the serialized control detail (249 record)
or the in-use serialized control (250 record). When using XHB to load/create a serialized
control detail (249 record) use the MILSTRIP requisition number of the receipt
document or 99S input due-in detail. When creating an in-use serialized control (250
record) for RVP, use the stock number and document number being reverse-posted. The
MILSTRIP document number must be proceeded by the stock record account number
(examples FE420891510025, FB420892650099).
2. The suffix code is only used to identify a partial receipt to the computer. If your
document number includes a suffix code, it must be input or the program will reject.
Otherwise, leave this field blank. If this is a PSP/FSL receipt and the 202 demand code
equals Z, add suffix code Z to the XHB input.
3. Left justified, alpha/numeric. Do not use spaces prior to the serial number. Enter up
to ten (10) separate serial numbers. Use the serial number entry fields sequentially, i.e.,
if you have three serial numbers to process, use input entry fields 1, 2, and 3 - not 1, 3,
and 5. If your serial number’s first position is a zero, enter a zero. For example, serial
number 012345 would read 012345(b)(b)(b)(b)(b) where (b) equals a blank.
4. Enter your base Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) in positions 51-56. For type
account code ‘E’, enter FE then the address of your account. If the type account code is
‘B’, then enter FB. EXAMPLE: FE4659 or FB4300.
5. For FED processing, use Type Phrase ‘SHIPPED’.
6. The input NSN must be loaded with a serialized report code of ‘C’ or program will
produce a 619 reject.
7. When attempting to process a shipment from a kit, first process a serviceable TIN to
