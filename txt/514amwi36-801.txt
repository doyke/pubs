1. Terms Explained:
     1.1. Active Duty: A tour of duty under orders (AF Form 938) for the purpose of performing
     Military Active Duty (AD), Active Duty for Training (ADT), Annual Tour (AT), or Active
     Duty for Special Work (ADSW).
     1.2. Alternative Work Schedule (AWS): An approved 80-hour pay period (full-time
     employees) which deviates from the basic 8-hour workday and is comprised of flexible and
     compressed work schedules.
     1.3. Flexible Work Schedule (FWS): An 80 hour bi-weekly basic work requirement that
     allows an employee to determine his or her own schedule within the limits set by the
     supervisor.
     1.4. Basic Work Requirement: The number of hours, excluding overtime, an employee is
     required to work or to account for by charging leave, credit hours, excused absence or
     holiday hours.
     1.5. Compensatory Time: Leave hours earned in lieu of overtime pay for an equal amount
     of time spent in irregular or occasional overtime work.
     1.6. Compressed Work Schedule (CWS): Enables employees to fulfill their basic work
     requirements in less than 10 days during the bi-weekly pay period.
     1.7. Core Hours: The time period during the workday that is within the tour of duty which
     an FWS employee must be present for work or on approved leave.
     1.8. Credit Hours: Credit hours may be earned only by FWS employees who elect to work
     in excess of their daily work schedule. When an employee no longer participates in the FWS
     program (i.e., changes to a normal or CWS option during the year), the employee must be
     paid for unused accumulated credit hours at their current rate of pay. An employee may
     NOT be compensated for credit hours for any other reason (e.g., excess, unused credit hours
     that cannot be carried forward into the next pay period). Employees will annotate the remarks
     section of AFRC Form 270 with supervisor approval and specific duties performed while
     earning credit hours. Both the employee and the supervisor must closely monitor credit hour
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                     3


  balances. Employees will not normally be allowed to earn credit or compensatory time prior
  to 0630. Exceptions are for mission requirements. For example, early aircraft generation,
  launch or recovery duties; personnel deployment processing; or other hands-on mission
  duties. Normal administrative or managerial duties should not be accomplished prior to
  0630.
  1.9. Dual Compensation: Receiving pay from the military while also receiving pay as a
  federal civil service employee.
  1.10. Inappropriate Dual Compensation: Occurs when civilian and military work
  schedules overlap and the employee is not in an official leave status, (e.g., annual leave,
  military leave, compensatory time, credit hours earned, or leave without pay from the civilian
  position).
  1.11. Exempt Employee: Any employee not covered by the provisions of the Fair Labor
  Standards Act (FLSA). See 5 CFR Chapter 1, para 551.203.
  1.12. Flexible Hours: The times during the workday within the tour of duty during which
  an FWS employee may choose to vary his or her times of arrival to and departure from the
  work site consistent with the duties and requirements of the position.
  1.13. Inactive Duty: Military training to include Unit Training Assembly (UTA),
  Additional Flight Training Period (AFTP), Additional Ground Training Period (AGTP),
  Equivalent Training (ET), or Readiness Management Period (RMP).
  1.14. Military Leave Paid: Absences from civilian duty, without loss of pay, to perform
  military duty. Civilian employees who are also reservists and guardsmen are entitled to 120
  hours of military leave each fiscal year. This military leave can be carried over to the next
  fiscal year not to exceed a total balance of 240 hours. Traditional military leave is used for
  active and inactive duty. This leave does not have to be exhausted before the use of other
  leave.
  1.15. Military Leave for Mobilized Federal Civilians: Employees that are called or
  ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101
  (a)(13) and are members of the Reserve or National Guard are entitled to the additional 22
  workdays of military leave per calendar year. Any military pay received must be offset, less
  any travel, transportation, or other per diem allowances, against the civilian pay the employee
  received during the 22 workdays. In short, an employee is entitled to the greater of his or her
  civilian or military pay, but not both.
  1.16. Non-Exempt Employee: Any employee covered by the provisions of the FLSA; also
  referred to as a non-bargaining employee.
  1.17. Normal Civilian Duty Day: Monday-Friday, 0745-1630, 45 minute lunch.
  1.18. Premium Pay: Additional compensation for overtime, night differential, Sunday and
  holiday duty.
  1.19. Tour of Duty: That period which defines the limits set by the Commander within
  which an employee must complete his or her basic work requirement. During unusual
  circumstances such as mission requirements, the supervisor has the authority to temporarily
  change/extend the tour of duty hours, which would increase the flexible time period,
 4                                                             514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012


     allowing the employee to earn credit hours. Under a compressed work schedule or other
     fixed schedule, tour of duty is synonymous with basic work requirement.
     1.20. Official duty station means the geographic area surrounding an employee’s regular
     work site as designated by the employing agency for the purpose of determining whether
     travel time is compensable.
     1.21. Compensable refers to periods of time that are creditable as hours of work for the
     purpose of determining a specific pay entitlement. If the time does not generate additional
     compensation, it is not compensable.
     1.22. Travel is defined to mean officially authorized travel that is for work purposes and is
     approved by an authorized agency official.
     1.23. Creditable Travel Time includes the time an employee actually spends traveling
     between their official duty station and a temporary duty station, or between two temporary
     duty stations, and the usual waiting time that precedes or interrupts such travel.

     2.1. Senior ART/Wing Commander. The Senior ART/Wing Commander will ensure all
     assigned personnel comply with this instruction. The Senior ART/Wing Commander is also

     2.2. Supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for time and attendance management of
     assigned employees, to include scheduling, tracking and documentation of assigned work.

        attendance records to ensure employees are properly compensated in accordance with this
        guidance and AFI36-815.

        3.1.1. Overtime/compensatory time must be approved on an AF Form 428 prior to
        performance of the work. In an emergency, the supervisor may verbally approve
        overtime/compensatory time earned with AF Form 428 completion no later than the next
        duty day. Specific justification of duty to be performed must be included in all AF Form
        428 requests. A separate AF Form 428 must be submitted for each pay period and no
        lump sum approvals can be made in advance unless for a specific reason, e.g., airlift
        missions or special projects. Supervisors must ensure that employees do not exceed the
        maximum number of compensatory hours they may earn bi-weekly. Completed AF
        Forms 428 will be submitted to the timekeeper for processing.
        3.1.2. Non-bargaining employees and Federal Wage System employees must be paid
        overtime for work in excess of 40 hours in a basic work week unless they request
        compensatory time earned. If compensatory time earned is requested, the statement “I
        ELECT COMPENSATORY TIME IN LIEU OF OVERTIME” must appear on the AF
        Form 428 and be signed by the employee prior to approval.
        3.1.3. GS employees whose basic rate of pay exceeds the minimum rate of GS-10 may
        be required to take compensatory time instead of overtime.
        3.1.4. Except under certain unusual circumstances, no overtime/compensatory time or
        credit hours may be earned while TDY for formal training. If in doubt, contact the
        civilian personnel office for guidance.
        3.1.5. Overtime/compensatory requests must be processed by the supervisor and
        approved by the Senior ART/Wing Commander or as further delegated. Compensatory
        time may not be earned in lieu of premium pay for regularly scheduled overtime/holiday
        pay.
        3.1.6. The use of compensatory time requires supervisor approval. It must be used
        within 26 pay periods following the pay period in which it was earned. Compensatory
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                    7


     time off not used during the established time period shall be paid at the overtime rate at
     which it was earned.
     3.1.7. Compensatory Time for Official Travel
         3.1.7.1. Each hour spent by an employee in travel status away from the official duty
         station of the employee, that is not otherwise compensable.
         3.1.7.2. To qualify for Compensatory Time for Official Travel, travel must be for
         work purposes and must be approved by an authorized agency official or otherwise
         authorized under established agency policies.
         3.1.7.3. An employee must use his or her accrued compensatory time off for travel
         by the end of the 26th pay period after the pay period in which it was credited or the
         employee must forfeit the compensatory time off.
         3.1.7.4. Employees may not earn compensatory time off for travel during basic
         holiday hours because they are entitled to their rate of basic pay for those hours.
         Compensatory time off for travel may be earned by an employee only for time spent
         in a travel status away from the employee’s official duty station when such time is not
         otherwise compensable.
         3.1.7.5. Airline travelers are required to arrive at the airport at a designated pre-
         departure time. Such time at the airport is considered usual waiting time and is
         creditable time in a travel status. In addition, time spent at an airport waiting for a
         connecting flight also is creditable time in a travel status.
         3.1.7.6. If an employee experiences an unusually long waiting period between actual
         times of travel, which occur during an employee’s regular working hours, these hours
         are compensable as part of the employees regularly scheduled administrative work
         week. However, unusually long waiting periods, between actual times of travel, that
         fall outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled work hours are not compensable.
         Unusually long waiting periods are defined as time away from the transportation
         waiting area that can be used for rest, sleep, or conducting personal business.
         3.1.7.7. If an employee is required to travel directly between his or her home and a
         temporary duty station outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station, the
         travel time is creditable as time in a travel status. However, the employee must deduct
         from such travel hours the time that he or she would have spent in normal home-to-
         work or work-to-home commuting.
  3.2. Absences From Duty. All excused absences will be IAW with AFI 36-815. Personnel
  performing military duty during scheduled civilian work hours will be in an appropriate leave
  status. Sick leave is normally not used as a leave status to perform military duty except when
  used IAW AFRCI 36-803. The OPM 71 will be used for all leave requests. The AFRC
  Form 270 is not considered an appropriate form to request/approve leave.
     3.2.1. Employees who begin military duty after completion of their civilian work day are
     entitled to civilian pay without charge to leave even though they receive a full day’s
     military pay. However, if they receive military duty pay on consecutive days for active
     duty performed, they must be in a paid leave status to receive pay from their civilian
     position on such days.

       3.2.2. Employees who perform inactive duty (UTA, ET, AFTP, AGTP) during their
       scheduled civilian workday must be in an appropriate leave status for the period of time
       the inactive duty overlaps their civilian workday. Employees must be in an appropriate
       leave status beginning at directed show time and when performing mission planning, pre-
       flight or post-flight duties associated with an AFTP.
       3.2.3. Employees who choose to interrupt their civilian work hours in order to participate
       in inactive duty status will continue to the end of the military tour of duty. Employees
       will not switch back to civilian status at the end of the period of inactive duty to complete
       their civilian work day without a charge to leave for the time spent during the inactive
       duty period.
       3.2.4. Employees returning from Active Duty in support of the Global War on Terrorism
       may be authorized an excused absence of 5 working days. In order to receive the excused
       absence employees must have spent at least 42 consecutive days on active duty. The
       absence must be the first 5 days back in civilian status and may run concurrent with
       military terminal leave. Employees are only eligible for 1 excused absence in a 12 month
       period. A new 12 month period begins after the use of the previous absence.
    3.3. Civilian Physical Fitness Program.
       3.3.1. A civilian physical fitness program enables full time appropriated fund employees
       to participate in a fitness program. Activities that constitute physical fitness are aerobics,
       walking, jogging, biking, exercise machines, free weights, and general calisthenics.
       Fitness activities may only be performed on base.
       3.3.2. A maximum of 3 hours per week may be used for physical fitness activities, with
       prior supervisory approval. The time used must be in blocks of time that are 1.5 hours or
       less. Only one block of time per day is authorized under this program. Employees must
       report to their work center before going to the exercise site and must report back to their
       work center at the completion of the exercise even if done during the last hour of the duty
       day.
       3.3.3. Participation in this program must be approved by the employee’s first level
       supervisor and is contingent upon no adverse mission impact. Specific times for
       participating in physical fitness activities will be dictated by mission requirements and
       approved in advance by the employee’s first level supervisor. First level supervisors
       have the authority to disallow participation due to mission requirements and/or vary the
       times the employee may participate. impact is the key element in making this decision.
       Normally, overtime, compensatory time, and credit hours may not be approved nor
       earned on days when use of duty time is approved under this program. Approval
       authority for exceptions is the employee’s Group Commander. Participation privileges
       may be revoked if any abuse is identified and disciplinary action may be taken.
       3.3.4. Forms prescribed by local civilian personnel must be completed by the employee
       and submitted to first level supervisor accompanied by a doctor’s statement certifying
       that physical fitness activities are permitted and identifying any limiting conditions.
    3.4. Alternative Work Schedule. Title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 61, Subchapter II, establishes
    permanent authority for flexible and compressed work schedules.
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                   9


     3.4.1. Approved Alternative Work Schedules: There are two types of approved
     Alternative Work Schedules; compressed work schedule and flexible work schedule.
        3.4.1.1. Compressed Work Schedule (CWS) – The tour of duty for employees under
        the CWS program is defined by a fixed schedule as approved by the supervisor.
        There are no provisions for employee flexibility in reporting or quitting times. Credit
        hours can not be earned under a CWS program. Two CWS options are authorized.
        Under all options, the non-work day must be approved by the supervisor and is not
        necessarily Monday or Friday. Any other CWS options must be approved by the
        Senior ART/Wing Commander.
           3.4.1.1.1. 5/4 – 9 Plan: A full time employee works eight 9 hour days and one 8
           hour day for a total of 80 hours in a bi-weekly pay period.
           3.4.1.1.2. Four Day Workweek: A full time employee must work 10 hours a day,
           40 hours a week, and 80 hours in a bi-weekly pay period.
           3.4.1.1.3. Expeditor Schedule: A full time employee must work six 12 hour days
           and either one 8 hour day or two 4 hour days for a total of 80 hours in a bi-
           weekly pay period. This schedule is only authorized to maintenance flightline
           expeditors.
        3.4.1.2. Flexible Work Schedule (FWS) – Two FWS options are authorized, any
        other FWS options must be approved at the Wing Commander/Senior ART.
           3.4.1.2.1. Flextour: The basic work requirement for a full time employee is 8
           hours a day, 40 hours a week, and 80 hours a bi-weekly pay period. Tour of duty
           limits, as requested by the employee and determined by the supervisor, normally
           should not exceed 11 hours. The hours that define tour of duty limits include core
           hours, flexible hours (before and/or after core hours), and a standard meal period
           of .50, .75 or 1.0 hour. Employees request fixed arrival and departure times,
           which are subject to supervisor approval and results in a fixed scheduled. The
           duty hours and core hours should be the same for all flexible schedules.
           3.4.1.2.2. Gliding Schedule: The official 514 AMW gliding schedule tour of
           duty hours are 0630-1730 with core hours from 0830-1500 and up to a one hour
           lunch period scheduled between 1100 and 1300. Flexible hours are 0630-0830
           and 1500-1730. Under this option employees may, at their discretion, vary daily
           arrival times between 0630 and 0830 in .25 hour increments. They must complete
           their basic work requirement of 8 hours from that arrival time, excluding the
           lunch period. For example, an employee that is schedule to report at 0730 must
           work until 1600 to include a 30 minute lunch period or 1630 when the lunch
           period is one hour. Working fewer hours will require supervisor approval for
           leave. Working beyond 1630 could earn credit hours, but requires supervisor
           approval and must be driven by work requirements. The core hours always
           remain 0830-1500 regardless of the meal period approved. These are the only
           gliding schedules approved (see Attachment 3).
               3.4.1.2.2.1. Any organization within the 514 AMW that desires to implement
               a different gliding schedule from the official options described above must
               receive 514 AMW Commander approval in writing.
10                                                        514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012


           3.4.1.2.3. All employees will maintain an AFRC Form 270, AFRC Timecard
           Worksheet. At the end of each pay period the each employee will present a
           completed AFRC Form 270 to their immediate supervisor for review and
           certification. The supervisor will forward the document to the timekeeper for
           review and verification. The timekeeper will update the work center’s DCPS
           data.
     3.4.2. Rules Governing Alternative Work Schedule:
        3.4.2.1. A basic premise of the AWS program is that there will be no negative impact
        on work productivity, diminished level of services, or increased costs of operation.
        3.4.2.2. Management is authorized, but not directed, to approve alternative work
        schedules within their areas. Management must be fair and equitable and ensure that
        work centers are manned to accomplish required work. Management will not
        approve alternative work schedule changes for the sole purpose of avoiding charges
        to military leave.
        3.4.2.3. Work centers will be manned during prime customer service hours as
        established or published by the work center supervisor.
        3.4.2.4. Full-time employees will be scheduled to work eighty (80) hours and part-
        time employees will be scheduled to work not more that sixty-four (64) hours per bi-
        weekly work period.
        3.4.2.5. Work shifts and lunch periods must begin and end on quarter hour
        increments: i.e. on the hour, hour + 15 minutes, etc.
        3.4.2.6. Employees desiring to use annual leave, LWOP, sick leave, credit hours,
        military leave, or compensatory time off for an entire work shift will be charged the
        amount of time equal to the alternative work shift that was scheduled for that day,
        e.g., if alternative work shift schedule was ten hours and employee requested sick
        leave, the employee is charged for ten hours of sick leave.
        3.4.2.7. Credit hours may be earned only by FWS employees to include weekends.
        An employee’s right to earn or use earned credit hours is subject to supervisor
        approval. Remarks identifying specific duties performed while earning credit hours
        are required in the AFRC Form 270 remarks section. Both the employee and the
        supervisor must closely monitor credit hour balances. If not closely monitored and a
        work requirement exists, it may be necessary for management to approve
        compensatory time in lieu of credit hours to avoid loss. Employees will not normally
        be allowed to earn credit or compensatory time prior to 0630. Exceptions are for
        mission requirements. For example, early aircraft generation, launch or recovery
        duties; personnel deployment processing; or other hands-on mission duties. Normal
        administrative or managerial duties should not be accomplished prior to 0630.
        Employees may not earn any additional compensation or credit hours for working
        voluntarily during holiday hours. However, if permitted by agency policies or
        negotiated agreements, supervisors may approve requests from employees under
        FWS schedules to earn credit hours for work in excess of the basic work requirement
        on a holiday. Full-time employees under FWS are excused only from 8 hours of their
        basic work requirement because of the holiday. Credit hours are worked at the option
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                   11


        of the employee and must be approved by the supervisor. They are distinguished
        from overtime hours in that they are not officially ordered. Credit hours are approved
        in advance by management. NOTE: Overtime hours, when used with respect to
        FWS employees, refers to all hours in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a
        week that are officially ordered in advance by management. Employees may request
        to earn credit hours in lieu of management directed overtime. An employee’s right to
        use earned credit hours is subject to supervisor approval. There is no limit on the
        number of credit hours that may be earned during a pay period. However, a full time
        employee cannot carry forward more than 24 hours from one pay period to the next.
        Both the employee and the supervisor must closely monitor the credit hour balance to
        preclude losses. If not closely monitored and a work requirement exists, it may be
        necessary for the supervisor to approve overtime or compensatory time in lieu of
        credit hours to avoid loss.
     3.4.3. Procedures For Implementing Alternative Work Schedule:
        3.4.3.1. Employees interested in participating in the AWS program must submit a
        written request to management outlining their choice of plan and tour of duty hours
        (refer to attachment 2 for a sample format). Core hours are established by the Wing
        Commander/Senior ART. In accordance with the Labor Management Agreement,
        bargaining unit employees must submit their requests to the union for review prior to
        submitting to management.
        3.4.3.2. Alternative work schedules must be requested and approved in writing no
        later than termination of the work shift Wednesday, prior to the start of the affected
        bi-weekly work period. After an alternative work schedule has been approved, it
        remains in effect until a new schedule is requested and approved. Normally, changes
        to an approved alternative work schedule cannot be made for the current bi-weekly
        work period. requirements or emergency situations may require exceptions to these
        procedures.
        3.4.3.3. An approved copy of the alternative work schedule will be filed in the
        employee’s Time and Attendance folder and the original will be returned to the
        employee.
        3.4.3.4. Employee integrity and a relationship of trust between the employee and
        management are the keystones of a successful AWS program. If documented patterns
        of duty absence or credit hour/leave abuse on the part of an employee are established,
        management may remove the employee from the program and return them to their
        pre-AWS work schedule.
  3.5. Lunch Periods:
     3.5.1. All work shifts of six hours or more will include a scheduled lunch period. Lunch
     periods must be at least 30 minutes in length, and be scheduled during the mid time of the
     work shift. It is inappropriate to schedule and take a lunch period at the beginning or end
     of the civilian workday.
     3.5.2. Compensable on-the-job meals are authorized only when more than one 8-hour
     shift is in operation during a 24-hour period and an overlapping of shifts to permit time
 12                                                           514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012


       off for lunch is not feasible, an on-the-job lunch period of 20 minutes or less may be
       authorized.
   3.6. Premium Pay. Employees whose regularly scheduled work shift is outside of the
   normal civilian work day may be entitled to additional pay, to include: night differential,
   overtime, Sunday premium and holiday pay. Employees cannot earn compensatory time for
   work performed during normal duty hours on either a holiday or the day on which a holiday
   is observed.
       3.6.1. Employees accompanying aircraft away from home station (e.g., aircrew
       members, ground support personnel, etc.) will comply with AFI 36-807/AFRC
       SUPPLEMENT, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and Observances. It is assumed
       that these employees, except CWS employees, are on a flexible work schedule. Credit
       hours can be earned for hours of work beyond the basic or regular work hours for periods
       of irregularly scheduled overtime while performing long-distance flights.
   3.7. Pay Cap. Compensatory time granted is subject to the aggregate salary limitations in
   Title 5 U.S.C. 5547 which prohibits payment of overtime to employees whose rate of basic
   compensation equals or exceeds the maximum rate of basic compensation for GS-15. No
   employee may receive compensation and pay totaling more than the maximum rate payable
   to a GS-15, Step 10, in any pay period. The following method will be used to compute the
   maximum number of compensatory hours an employee may earn in a pay period without
   exceeding the aggregate salary limitation:
       3.7.1. Examples:
           3.7.1.1. “CURRENT SALARY” divided by 2087 hours x 80 = “BIWEEKLY
           SALARY”
           3.7.1.2. “GS-15/10 BIWEEKLY SALARY” minus the employee’s “BIWEEKLY
           SALARY” = “DOLLAR DIFFERENCE,” which is the maximum additional dollar
           amount the employee can earn bi-weekly.
           3.7.1.3. “DOLLAR DIFFERENCE” divided by (1.5 x GS 10/1 hourly rate, or
           employee hourly rate if GS-12/6 or higher) = “AVAILABLE HOURS,” which is the
           number of hours of compensatory time an employee may earn bi-weekly.
       3.7.2. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all employees are aware of their
       individual aggregate salary limits.
       3.7.3. Employees are responsible for ensuring they do not exceed the aggregate salary
       limit.
   3.8. AFRC Form 270, AFRC Timecard Worksheet. This is the only approved method for
   the collection of time and attendance data. This form becomes an official record used for
   historical documentation and audit trail. Supervisors must use this form for all employees.
4. Military Duty. All military duty performed by an employee will be approved in advance by
the supervisor. The OPM Form 71 will be used to request leave for military duty. Use of leave
will be verified by the civilian timekeeper prior to submission for payment. Civilian employees
of the 514 AMW that are also assigned as reservists to the 514 AMW will identify to their
reserve unit of assignment the name of their civilian supervisor and timekeeper, if not the same.
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                  13


   4.1. Active Duty.
      4.1.1. After completion of the active duty tour, employees will submit the certified AF
      Form 938 to their timekeeper who will ensure appropriate leave has been taken. The
      timekeeper will sign and date the AF Form 938. Military pay will not process an AF
      Form 938 without the timekeeper’s signature.
   4.2. Inactive Duty.
      4.2.1. For Unit Training Assemblies (UTA), Rescheduled Unit Training Assemblies
      (RUTA), Equivalent Training Periods (ET), Readiness Management Periods (RMP),
      Aircrew Flying Training Period (AFTP), and Aircrew Ground Training Period (AGTP),
      employees will report to their civilian supervisor to verify the civilian pay records are
      properly documented to preclude inappropriate dual compensation. Document civilian
      duty day hours in the remarks section of the AF IMT 40A. The timekeeper will sign and
      date the remarks section of the AF IMT 40A to ensure appropriate leave has been taken.
      4.2.2. For Aircrew Ground Training Period, (AGTP) and Aircrew Flying Training Period
      (AFTP), document duty using the AF Form 3956. The timekeeper will initial the form to
      ensure appropriate leave was taken.
   4.3. TDY Conversion.
      4.3.1. Converting from civilian TDY status to active duty status must occur at midnight
      regardless of civilian tour of duty. This also applies to active duty TDY converting to
      civilian duty status.
5. Time and Attendance Training.
   5.1. Purpose: The goal of time and attendance training is to help guarantee all 514 AMW
   personnel take a proactive role to ensure accurate accounting and the prevention of
   inappropriate leave/dual compensation.
   5.2. Training Responsibility: Group commanders will establish Time and Attendance
   training programs that ensure every employee, timekeeper, and supervisor level member
   receives appropriate training consistent with the member’s level of responsibility.
   5.3. Training Resource: The wing budget office (514 AMW/FM) will develop and
   maintain Power Point Time & Attendance training slides and make them accessible on the S
   drive, in a folder titled Time & Attendance Training.
   5.4. Time and Attendance Training Documentation: All employees will receive an initial
   training class and refresher training as directed by group commanders. All Time &
   Attendance training will be documented on a memorandum for record and signed by group
   commanders or the wing Time and Attendance POC. This documentation will be filed in
   each member’s Time & Attendance folder.
   5.5. Validation of training: Employee folders will be reviewed annually to screen for
   100% employee time and attendance training certification/documentation.
   5.6. Timekeepers. All primary and alternate timekeepers will complete training in Defense
   Civilian Pay System (DCPS). Coordinate training accomplishment with Active Duty host
   civilian pay office.
 14                                                            514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012


6. Internal Controls. The purpose of internal audits is to ensure compliance with established
time and attendance guidance and procedures, as well as identify inappropriate compensation
and time and attendance accounting errors. Internal audit procedures are established as follows:
   6.1. Group commanders will ensure time and attendance audits are completed on employees
   annually with 25 percent of assigned personnel reviewed each quarter. Review selected time
   and attendance records to cover all pay periods that start within each quarter. Appointed
   auditors will use AFRC developed Time and Attendance auditing checklist or locally
   developed checklists. Locally developed checklists must be coordinated through the Wing
   T&A POC for Wing/CC approval. All audit checklists and other auditing tools will be stored
   in shared folders on local computer drives.
   6.2. Group commanders will forward quarterly audit results to Budget Officer (514
   AMW/FM) no later than 30 days after completion of quarterly audit. As a minimum, audit
   reports will include total number of records reviewed and total number of errors found for
   dual compensation, inappropriate leave/duty, and AF Form 428 discrepancies. The 514
   AMW Budget Officer in conjunction with the Wing Time and Attendance POC will
   determine group audit and completion status and compile results for forwarding to 514
   AMW/CC quarterly.
   6.3. Wing/CC staff will conduct random time and attendance audits annually to evaluate the
   overall effectiveness of group level audits to include validating corrections to audit findings.
7. Examples. The following examples are provided to aid in understanding the provisions and
intent of this instruction.
   7.1. An employee’s regularly scheduled civilian workweek is 0730-1630, Monday through
   Friday, with a 1-hour lunch break from 1130-1230. He/she is placed in ADT status at 1700
   hours Monday and is released from duty at 2300 hours the same Monday night. No charge to
   leave is required, as the individual completed his/her civilian workday prior to the start of the
   man-day tour. (Reference: 49 Comptroller General 233 (1969))
   7.2. An employee has the same civilian tour of duty as in paragraph 7.1. He/she is placed
   in ADT status at 1700 hours on Monday and is released from duty at 1730 hours Tuesday.
   No leave is charged for Monday as military duty did not begin until after the end of the
   regularly scheduled civilian workday. The employee must be in a leave status for Tuesday as
   he/she was in military status during regularly scheduled civilian workday.
   7.3. An employee has a regularly scheduled civilian tour of duty 0730-1630 Monday through
   Friday, with a scheduled lunch period from 1130-1230. He/she is placed in man-day status
   for one (1) day starting at 1630 and is released from duty at 2300 hours on each of the
   following days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Separate sets of orders are issued for each
   day. Although military duty does not start each day until the end of the civilian workday, the
   individual must be charged leave for Tuesday and Wednesday. These are consecutive
   military days even though the individual is able to perform his/her civilian duties during the
   regularly scheduled civilian workday. Leave is not charged for Monday because the
   employee did not start military duty until after the civilian workday was completed.
   (Reference: CG B133972 and 37 Comptroller General 255)
   7.4. An employee has a regularly scheduled civilian workweek as in paragraph 7.3. He/she
   is placed on ADT starting at 1630 on the following days: Monday for one (1) day,
514AMWI36-801 2 APRIL 2012                                                                  15


  Wednesday for one (1) day, and Friday for one (1) day. The individual is released from duty
  each day in sufficient time so as to arrive home prior to midnight. In this case, consecutive
  days have not been performed, the duty was performed after the civilian workday was
  completed and, therefore, no charge to leave is required. However, if the individual is
  entitled to and receives a travel day at the end of the tour on Monday or Wednesday, then
  appropriate leave must be taken on Tuesday or Thursday.
  7.5. An employee has a regularly scheduled civilian workweek of 0730-1630 Monday
  through Friday, with a one-hour lunch break from 1130-1230. He/she is placed on ADT
  beginning 1630 Friday and is released from duty on Sunday. No charge to leave is required,
  because the military duty did not start before completion of the civilian workday on Friday.
  7.6. An employee has the same scheduled workweek as in paragraph 7.5. He/she is placed
  on ADT at 1630 on Friday and is released from duty at 1200 on Monday. Friday is not
  charged to military leave as the individual was able to complete his/her regularly scheduled
  civilian workday. Saturday and Sunday are not charged to leave. Leave must be charged for
  that portion of the civilian workday on Monday for which the individual performed military
  duty. Note: Military leave does not have to be exhausted before the use of other leave.
  (Reference: Public Law 104-106, Section 516)
  7.7. An employee has a regularly scheduled civilian tour of duty 0730-1630 Monday through
  Friday, with a one-hour lunch scheduled during the mid time of work shift. He/she is placed
  in man-day status at 1700 on Monday, released from duty at 0730 hours Tuesday, performs
  his/her regularly scheduled civilian workdays Tuesday and Wednesday, is again placed in
  man-day status at 1700 Wednesday, released at 0730 Thursday, and reports to the civilian
  workplace. In this case, leave is not charged for Monday and Thursday because the regularly
  scheduled civilian workday was completed prior to reporting for military duty on Monday
  and the individual was able to report to the civilian workplace prior to the start of the
