1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. The Base Transportation Officer (TO) will appoint a Base Container Monitor (BCM).
     1.2. The BCM will:
        1.2.1. Provide and document training for all UCMs.
        1.2.2. Track reusable container usage/non-usage by squadron using CMOS.
        1.2.3. Conduct an initial on-site inspection of reusable container storage areas and
        additional inspections when deemed necessary.
        1.2.4. Maintain a file of appointed UCMs.
        1.2.5. Convene a reusable container working group to meet on an annual basis. The
        working group will consist of the unit UCMs and their Resource Advisors (RA). The
        objective of the working group will be to eliminate unnecessary expenditures of
        Department of Defense funds needed to replace containers. FM should be a member of
        this working group since funds are being addressed and the Resource Advisors (RAs) are
        involved.
        1.2.6. Provide staff assistance visits semi-annually. Conduct follow on training to units
        who request them.
        1.2.7. Monitor reusable containers on base for possible redistribution to eliminate the
        need to buy replacements unnecessarily.
        1.2.8. Provide recommendations for proper disposition of excess reusable containers.
        1.2.9. If required, process and monitor material reimbursement for replacement
        containers through the RA.
        1.2.10. Enforce maximum return of containers for reuse.
     1.3. Unit Commander Responsibilities:
        1.3.1. The Unit Commanders will appoint primary and alternate Unit Container Monitors
        (UCM) to represent the unit on all matters pertaining to the Base Reusable Container
        Program.
        1.3.2. Forward an updated UCM appointment letter to the BCM within 30 days of any
        changes.
        1.3.3. Ensure all cargo received is in the proper container prior to acceptance or obtain a
        SF 364 Report of Discrepancy from the issuing activity.
        1.3.4. Provide for approved storage areas for reusable containers.
     1.4. Unit Container Monitors will:
        1.4.1. Ensure all cargo turned into the 934 LRS/LGRDDC is in the proper container or
        has an AF Form 451, Request for Packaging Service attached with the paperwork for the
        item. Items without the proper container will not be accepted for turn in without this
        form. Note: If the item was issued without the proper container evident by a SF 364, the
        unit will not be charged. The AF Form 451can only be signed by the primary/alternate
934AWI24-203 10 JULY 2012                                                                       3


      UCM, RA or unit commander. Procedures for completing the AF Form 451 can be found
      in AFI 24-203, Attachment 5.
      1.4.2. Identify and maintain an active reusable storage area. The storage area must be a
      covered, clean, dry space to protect reusable containers and packing materials from
      inclement weather. The UCMs will identify the storage locations in writing to the BCM.
      The locations will include building number and room location within the building. A map
      indicating the storage locations is sufficient.
      1.4.3. Provide the BCM with an updated listing of all excess containers on a semi-annual
      basis. Excess containers through initial issue may be turned over to the BCM to be
      redistributed to other organizations to preclude unnecessary purchase or construction.
      1.4.4. Report packaging improvements that will increase efficiency of the program to the
      BCM.
      1.4.5. Protect all containers and packaging materials to maintain containers for reuse.
      Note: consolidation of locations is authorized (reference AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
      Equipment Maintenance Management, Para. 11.28 and 11.32.9.
      1.4.6. Train unit personnel on the importance of reusing containers and packaging
      materials. Training will be documented on AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
      Continuation/Command (JQS) or similar automated product.
      1.4.7. Attend Reusable Container meetings and training sessions as directed by the
      BCM.
2. Procedures:
   2.1. 934 LRS/LGRDDC
      2.1.1. The Receiving Section will make sure items received are not separated from their
      respective containers. If an item is received without the proper container, a SF 364 will
      be accomplished and distributed accordingly.
      2.1.2. Storage and Issue will ensure the applicable items are issued in the original
      container. Property received without the required Special Packaging Instruction (SPI)
      container should be accompanied by a SF 364 noting the discrepancy. The SF 364 will be
      used to support requests for packaging. If the item is going into storage, the BCM will
      arrange for the proper container.
   2.2. All Other Units:
      2.2.1. On receipt from 934 LRS/LGRDDC, the individual signing for the item will verify
      the item is in the proper container. Items received will stay in their containers until such
      time as required for use or inspection.
      2.2.2. Units will not accept an item needing a reusable container for turn in unless the
      item in accompanied by an AF Form 451 or SF 364 stating the item was received on base
      or issued to the unit without the correct container.
      2.2.3. When an item is received in a contractor supplied container (packed), every effort
      should be made to return the item or its authorized substitute in the original container.
4                                                                934AWI24-203 10 JULY 2012


       Contractor containers are authorized reusable containers and should be treated in the
       same manner.
       2.2.4. When an item is removed from the container and put into use, ensure the
       repairable is immediately placed in the same container for turn in to Supply. If the item
       is removed and the container not immediately reused, it will be stored in the appropriate
       designated storage areas. Ensure all internal blocking, bracing, and cushioning materials
       are stored in the container. A reusable container must have all components included to be
       considered complete. Any containers missing components will require an AF Form 451
       to replace them.
    2.3. Reimbursement process:
       2.3.1. When an item is turned in without the proper container and no supporting
       documentation (either an AF Form 451 or SF 364) the unit turning the item in may be
       responsible for the cost of the replacement container. If it is determined that the unit is
       responsible for payment, the BCM will turn over the AF Form 451 including all costs
       incurred to the LRS RA, (LRS/LGL) who will send out a Reusable Container
       Reimbursement Letter (attachment 2).
       2.3.2. The LRS RA will forward the AF Form 451 and request for reimbursement to the
       respective unit RA. The unit RA will then reimburse the LGRDD account.
    2.4. Excess Reusable Containers:
       2.4.1. Excess is defined when an activity generates a local excess over current or
       projected requirements. So identify, segregate and inspect the condition of containers.
       Additional details as follows:
       2.4.2. Containers identified as excess will be coordinated through the BCM for
       disposition instructions. The BCM will inspect unit storage areas to validate the necessity
       for redistribution.
       2.4.3. If a reusable container is turned in as excess and not redistributed, it will become
       part of the base excess. These containers will be made available for use by other units
       if/when required. Note: This will not be considered courtesy storage and the containers
       may be shipped, reissued, or reused at the discretion of the BCM.
       2.4.4. The BCM will post excess containers on the RECON World-Wide Warehouse
       website to ensure maximal utilization throughout the Defense Transportation System.
