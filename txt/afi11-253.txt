                                            Chapter 1

                    PROCESS OVERVIEW / GENERAL GUIDELINES

1.1. Fuel Purchases. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), through the Defense Working
Capital Fund, purchases all fuel used by the services, regardless of whether an aircraft refuels on
an Air Force base, another DoD location, or a commercial airport. DLA then bills the Air Force
directly for the fuel. Any non-fuel charges incurred are paid by Air Force units.
1.2. AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log. Regardless of the refueling method,
aircrew members must use the AF Form 664 to document each and every refueling and ground
services transaction that occurs away from the aircraft’s home station, and to turn in receipts
from all transactions. Wing Refueling Document Control Officers (WRDCOs) will track these
transactions (both aviation fuel and ground services), verify that they are accurate within DoD
financial systems, and take appropriate action when errors occur.
1.3. Aircrew. For the purposes of this instruction, the term “aircrew” will be used in a generic
sense to represent both operational aircrew members and any aircraft maintenance personnel
(e.g. crew chiefs) who accompany the aircraft as part of its mission. At a minimum, the term
“aircrew” will mean the Pilot in Command / Aircraft Commander (PIC/AC).

   funds to cover all unbilled aviation fuel charges.
2.4. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC).
   2.4.1. Mission Planning. Consider sources and availability of fuel when planning off-station
   missions and use U.S. military fuel resources and related services whenever possible. Follow
   the priorities in paragraph 3 during mission planning.
   2.4.2. Passenger Flight Contingencies. Air Force aircraft often fly missions where the
   passengers are on group orders and thus ineligible for per diem payments. If an aircraft
   flying this kind of mission is funded by the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
   and must make an unexpected stop, the TACC has the authority to approve AIR Card®
   expenses to pay for passenger provisions (i.e. food, lodging, and transportation). Aircrew
   members will document these expenses in the same manner as other ground service
   expenses.

2.5. Wing Commander or Equivalent. The wing commander is responsible for the financial
resources used to refuel a wing’s aircraft regardless of the fund source. Therefore, the wing
commander is ultimately responsible for ensuring that refueling expenditures are monitored,
tracked, and reconciled against the current financial systems. Wing Commanders of tanker-
assigned units are also responsible to ensure that the Air Force is appropriately reimbursed for
any fuel provided via in-flight refuelings. Therefore, wing commanders will do the following:
     2.5.1. Appoint in writing a WRDCO. The WRDCO must be an Air Force member or a DoD
     civilian.
     2.5.2. Ensure the unit executes a MORD with the supporting Defense Finance & Accounting
     Service (DFAS) location to cover non-fuel purchases made with the AIR Card®.
     2.5.3. For units whose fuel is not centrally paid by Centralized Asset Management (CAM),
     ensure the unit executes a MORD with the supporting DFAS location to cover fuel
     purchases, and that there are sufficient funds at the end of the fiscal year (FY) to cover
     unprocessed fuel purchases.
     2.5.4. For units whose fuel is centrally purchased by CAM, ensure the unit informs CAM of

      2.9.19.6. Validate the accuracy of AIR Card® invoices against source documents; and
      forward them to the supporting DFAS field site to pay for all incurred ground servicing
      charges. Follow up with the local resource advisor and/or finance office to ensure that
      the invoices are paid in a timely manner.
          2.9.19.6.1. AIR Card® invoices may have charges, such as value-added taxes, that
          are not included on the source documentation. These situations will often arise when
          aircraft are serviced in foreign countries.
          2.9.19.6.2. In these cases, the WRDCO must exercise good judgment when
          submitting the invoices for payment.      If the charges are reasonable, then the
          WRDCO should submit the invoice for payment, even though there is no source
          documentation that matches the transactions. However, the WRDCO should question
          any charges that seem odd or excessive.
      2.9.19.7. Establish an account on the AIR Card® Contractor’s website. The current
      ACC website is: www.airseacard.com. WRDCOs will use the online system to request
      new cards and to perform account maintenance.
      2.9.19.8. Use Table 3 in Attachment 6 and/or approved checklist provided by the
      MAJCOMs as a guide for an effective program.

functions of a Certifying Official for non-fuel purchases.
   2.11.1. Execute a MORD with the supporting DFAS Accounting Liaison Office to pay for
   non-fuel charges. Ensure MORDs are executed with enough funds to cover AIR Card®
   charges for an entire fiscal year. Ensure that the MORD is processed and recorded in the
   accounting records prior to the end of the FY. Monitor the MORD to ensure that it is
   reduced as the outstanding charges are processed. Ensure that any residual funds after all
   transactions have cleared are deobligated.
   2.11.2. For units that use TWCF funds, execute a MORD with DFAS at the end of the fiscal
   year to pay for unbilled fuel charges. Ensure that the MORD is processed and recorded in
   the accounting records prior to the end of the fiscal year. Monitor the MORD to ensure that
   it is reduced as the outstanding charges are processed. Ensure that any residual funds after
   all transactions have cleared are deobligated.
   2.11.3. Ensure all documents are filed in a permanent file plan in a manner that would allow
   easy research should a problem or an audit occur.
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                         13


2.12. Pilot in Command (PIC) / Aircraft Commander (AC). Even if the PIC/AC did not
personally oversee the aircraft refueling process, the PIC/AC has the overall responsibility for all
actions associated with the aircraft. Therefore, the PIC/AC has the ultimate responsibility to
ensure that all refueling transactions (to include issuances of fuel from tanker missions) are
completely and accurately recorded on the appropriate forms and that all source documentation
(i.e. receipts) is retained. All pilots are considered to be AIR Card® users and must fulfill all
associated responsibilities (e.g. user training). All PIC/ACs shall:
   2.12.1. Consider sources and availability of fuel when planning off-station missions and use
   U.S. military fuel resources and related services whenever possible. Follow the priorities in
   paragraph 3 during mission planning.
   2.12.2. Ensure that all purchases of fuel and ground services are completely and accurately
   recorded in accordance with paragraph 4.
   2.12.3. Follow local procedures for turning in AF Form 664s, including all receipts for all
   fuel and ground service transactions, upon returning an aircraft to its home station; if local
   requirements dictate removing the receipts off station, then follow local procedures.
2.13. AIR Card® Users. Regardless of the method used (to include in-flight refueling), any
pilot or other aircrew member who authorizes an off-station refuel or the servicing of an aircraft
becomes a purchasing agent of the United States Air Force. An aircrew member signature as
purchaser documents the receipt of supplies and services and obligates the United States
Government to pay all charges on the receipt. Compliance with DoD and Air Force Standards
for ethical conduct is mandatory. Any Air Force member who uses an AIR Card® must comply
with Executive Order 12731, Principles of Ethical Conduct for Government Employees, dated 17
Oct 1990, 5 CFR 2635.202, DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, and DoD Charge Card
Guidebook Appendix G, "Unique Business Rules for AIR Card Programs," 20 Jan 06. All AIR
Card® users are held responsible to the government for any transaction not made for official
government use. All AIR Card® users shall:
   2.13.1. Follow the guidelines outlined in paragraph 4 when purchasing mission essential
   items.
   2.13.2. Ensure receipt documentation accurately reflects supplies/services rendered and
   retain all receipts. Record all purchases on the AF Form 664, regardless of whether the
   vendor provides a receipt. If a vendor refuses to provide a receipt, document the point-of-
   sale information by whatever means possible and store the documentation in the AF Form
   664. Report the situation to the WRDCO upon return. (Contracted vendors are to provide
   receipts in accordance with the terms of their contract).
   2.13.3. Complete initial AIR Card® user training before using the card; complete refresher
   training at least once every 3 years.
   2.13.4. Understand all policies, procedures and record-keeping requirements for the AIR
   Card® program and ensure proper use of the AIR Card®.

                                          Chapter 3

                           PRIORITY FOR FUEL RESOURCES

3.1. Priority for Fuel Resources. All Mission Planners must consider sources and availability
of fuel when planning off-station missions and will use U.S. military fuel resources and related
services whenever possible due to significant cost savings relative to prices charged at
commercial contract and non-contract facilities. Flight crews will use DLA Energy Into-Plane
contract vendors at commercial locations where DLA Energy Into-Plane contract fuel and
services are available. Aircrews are authorized to purchase fuel and services from any available
source when no DLA Energy Into-Plane contract exists at the commercial locations. Aircrews
will use AIR Card® merchants for aviation fuel purchases where available. Aircrews will follow
the order of precedent below when determining what refueling source to choose.
3.2. DoD Locations. Refueling support is available at most airfields operated by the Air Force,
Army, Navy and Marine Corps. These sources charge the Air Force the DoD standard price for
aviation fuel. Depending upon local procedures, aircrews will present either the DD Form 1896
or the AIR Card® when refueling.
3.3. Other Foreign Government Support. Depending upon local procedures, aircrews will
present the DD Form 1896 or the AIR Card® when refueling.
   3.3.1. DLA Energy has different types of agreements with foreign governments that provide
   for the reciprocal refueling of military aircraft and other vehicles. See DoD 4120.45-M,
   Volume 2, DoD Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas, and Coal, Chapter
   17, International Agreements, for additional details.
       3.3.1.1. Fuel Exchange Agreements (FEAs). Under the terms of FEAs, transactions are
       documented and periodically exchanged for validation. The party owed is normally
       reimbursed in fuel. Former Air Force agreements were referred to as Replacement-In-
       Kind agreements.
       3.3.1.2. Offset Billing Agreements (OBAs). Under the terms of OBAs, transactions are
       documented and periodically exchanged for validation. The parties determine a net
       balance owed, who is then reimbursed in cash.
       3.3.1.3. Direct Bill Agreements (DBAs). DBAs are agreements between DLA Energy
       and a foreign government where transactions are documented and billed individually or
       monthly and are paid in cash based upon the invoices submitted by the provider. DBAs
       are generally the preferred method for reimbursement.
   3.3.2. Multi-national Agreements. Within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
   obtain aviation fuel from foreign air forces under NATO Standardization Agreement
   (STANAG) 3113. Under this STANAG, the host air force services the United States aircraft
   charging the same price that the host air force charges its own units.
3.4. Into-Plane Contracts. DLA Energy negotiates into-plane refueling contracts at many
commercial airports. Aircrews must present an AIR Card® when purchasing aviation fuel from
DLA Energy into-plane contract sites. Refueling is normally available 24-hours a day, seven
days a week unless the contract specifies otherwise. DLA Energy bills the Air Force at a
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                       15


standard contract rate for transactions at these sites and requires fuel quality surveillance from
the vendors.
   3.4.1. Commercial vendors will not honor an expired AIR Card®. In the event an aircraft’s
   AIR Card® has expired, the aircrew should try to contact the ACC obtain a valid AIR Card®
   account number. If the aircrew cannot obtain a valid card account number, they should use a
   SF 44.
   3.4.2. The terms of the Into-Plane contracts require payment by the AIR Card®; therefore, if
   the aircrew does not present a valid AIR Card® for a contract purchase, the purchase will not
   qualify as a contract delivery at the contract price and will be processed as a local purchase.
   3.4.3. The Into Plane Contract Information System and the Fixed Base Operator (FBO)
   Locator, both available from the DLA Energy website, contain details on contract fuel
   vendors, ground services vendors, and vendors that accept the AIR Card®.
3.5. United States Air Force and Canadian Forces Suspense Account Agreement. This
agreement allows reciprocal servicing of United States Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft at
each other's bases and at both DoD and Canadian Forces into-plane locations. The Into-plane
Contract Listing outlines the Canadian forces into-plane locations. The DD Form 1896 is the
only authorized purchase card at Canadian into-plane locations for aviation fuel and must be
used. DO NOT present the AIR Card® to purchase fuel at these locations; aircrews will use the
AIR Card® for non-fuel purchases only.
   3.5.1. Purchases at Canadian Into-plane locations with DD Form 1896 are exempt from
   Canadian excise taxes and will be at the Into-Plane contract price.
   3.5.2. Canadian vendors under contract will accept the AIR Card® for payment of fuel.
   However, fuel purchases made with the AIR Card® at these locations will be charged the full
   retail price and will not be exempt from excise taxes.
3.6. Non-Contract Purchase at Commercial Airfields. Aircrews may purchase aviation fuel
and ground services on the open market using the AIR Card®. At locations where the AIR
Card® is not accepted and time permits, advise the vendor to call the 24-hour customer service
line on the back of the AIR Card® to secure an agreement for fuel and services. In the event the
vendor will not accept the AIR Card®, aircrews shall use an SF 44, for payment purposes. In a
few cases, aircrews may use cash to pay for fuel. See Attachment 4 for details regarding cash
purchases. DLA Energy bills the Air Force at the standard rate for aviation fuel for transactions
at non-contract sites. In addition, DLA Energy does not maintain oversight of fuel quality at
these locations.
 16                                                              AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013

                    DOCUMENTING REFUELING TRANSACTIONS

4.1. Documenting Refueling Transactions. Regardless of the method of refueling, aircrews
will record all aviation fuel transactions on the AF Form 664. In addition, aircrews will place
copies of all vendor receipts and completed DD Forms 1898, Energy Sales Slip, in the AF Form
664. If a commercial vendor does not provide a receipt, then document all Point of Sale
information by any means available, place the sale data in the AF Form 664, and record the
transaction on the exterior of the AF Form 664.
4.2. Standard Refuels.
   4.2.1. A minimum of one aircrew member (ordering official) shall be present during aircraft
   servicing to verify the accuracy of the recorded point of sale (POS) data and to ensure safe
   performance of the refueling operation.
   4.2.2. The aircrew member shall present the DD Form 1896 or the AIR Card® to the
   refueling personnel for imprinting/swiping of aircraft POS billing data. Aviation fuel or
   services charged without aircrew presentation of an AIR Card® will not be paid by the ACC
   and shall be processed by the home station Certifying Officer and/or AO as a local purchase.
   Aircrews refueling at Canadian National Defense Locations will present the DD Form 1896
   to receive contract pricing. Aircrews will use AIR Cards® to purchase non-fuel items at
   these locations.
   4.2.3. The aircrew member shall ensure that fuel products and ground services are
   separately, accurately, and legibly recorded on the DD Form 1898, commercial delivery
   ticket, or other POS ticket. The aircrew member shall ensure that the date of delivery is also
   correctly and legibly reflected on the form.
   4.2.4. The aircrew member shall ensure that the merchant prints and/or imprints the
   following minimum POS data on the DD Form 1898 or commercial delivery ticket:
       4.2.4.1. Merchant Identification Number (MIN) or the four character International Civil
       Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport identifier.
       4.2.4.2. CARNET number (CARNET refers to the Aircraft Tail Number) or, if
       applicable, AIR Card® number.
       4.2.4.3. Purchase date (Julian).
       4.2.4.4. Fuel Grade.
       4.2.4.5. Net fuel quantity purchased.
       4.2.4.6. Any additional charges for additives, call out fees, or applicable taxes (i.e.
       Federal, state, local, or airport).
       4.2.4.7. Overtime charges. The merchant shall record start and stop times on the DD
       Form 1898 or commercial delivery ticket with the total overtime annotated in fractional
       hours (e.g., 1 hour, 15 minutes = 1.25 hours).
   4.2.5. All commercial vendors are authorized to use a customized commercial U.S.
   Government AIR Card® slip, a DD Form 1898, or a commercial delivery ticket to capture all
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                        17


   pertinent POS data. The merchant and aircrew member will both sign the DD Form 1898 or
   commercial delivery ticket to certify that it accurately describes the purchase transaction. The
   merchant shall provide a copy of the DD Form 1898 or commercial delivery ticket to the
   aircrew member. (Into-Plane contracts require vendors to provide a completed copy of the
   delivery ticket to the aircrew member.)
   4.2.6. The merchant shall transmit POS purchase transaction data to the ACC for subsequent
   processing into the ACC database and the Defense Fuels Automated Management System for
   customer billing.
   4.2.7. In the event that a vendor provides a non-itemized receipt, the aircrew member should
   request a breakout of the charges. If the vendor refuses to provide one to the aircrew, the
   aircrew member should write “DISPUTED” on the receipt before signing.
4.3. In-Flight Refueling.
   4.3.1. MAJCOMs will develop guidance to ensure that tanker crews complete a DD Form
   791 as accurately as possible for each in-flight fueling mission. The DD Form 791 must
   contain enough information that the providing unit can bill the correct unit, service, or
   country for the fuel. In-flight issues will not be consolidated. MAJCOMs will also develop
   guidance to ensure that all aircrews receiving fuel from an in-flight refueling will completely
   record all such transactions on the AF Form 664.
   4.3.2. Conversion factors for fuel grades issued/jettisoned by tanker aircraft are:
       4.3.2.1. Grade JP5 6.8 pounds per gallon.
       4.3.2.2. Grade JP8/Jet A 6.7 pounds per gallon.
       4.3.2.3. Grade TS1 6.6 pounds per gallon.
   4.3.3. HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible for processing classified in-flight
   refueling transactions. These transactions will be processed only after being verified by HQ
   AMC-TACC/DOOS.
4.4. Aircraft Transfers.
   4.4.1. Maintenance personnel at both the losing and gaining units must inform their
   respective WRDCO of the loss/gain of any aircraft and the effective date of the transfer.
   Gaining maintenance personnel should turn in the old DD Form 1896 to the fuels
   management office and request a new DD Form 1896 with the DODAAC of the gaining unit.
   If the DD Form 1896 cannot be produced locally, the gaining unit must make a request via
   email to descsa.imprinters@dla.mil. The AIR Card® remains with the aircraft throughout
   the transfer.
   4.4.2. When aircraft transfer from one unit to another, the Fuels Enterprise System (FES)
   must be updated in order to charge the correct unit for the fuel. The FES has data feeds from
   the Reliability & Maintainability Information System (REMIS), and from the ACC’s billing
   system. In order for the billing data in the Business Systems Modernization – Energy (BSM-
   E) to be correct, the information in these two systems must also be correct.
   4.4.3. When transferring an aircraft to a different unit, the gaining unit will perform an
   acceptance inspection and update either IMDS or G081, depending upon the MDS of the
   aircraft. Both of these systems update the Reliability & Maintainability Information System
 18                                                              AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013


   (REMIS), which will update the BSM-E with the new aircraft data (e.g. DODAAC, owning
   organization).
   4.4.4. The WRDCOs of the losing unit will use the AIR Card® website to request that
   applicable AIR Card® be transferred to the gaining unit. The gaining WRDCO should
   include a Line of Accounting and the appropriate AIR Card® customer number for the
   transferred aircraft.
       4.4.4.1. Because of technical limitations with the AIR Card® system, any AIR Card®
       transactions that occur before the ACC transfers the aircraft in their system will be the
       financial responsibility of the losing unit, even if the aircraft was transferred in REMIS
       and gaining unit flew the mission.
   4.4.4.2. In these circumstances, the losing unit should request reimbursement from the
   gaining unit for those transactions.
4.5. Depot / New Aircraft.
   4.5.1. The AIR Card® and the DD Form 1896 will remain on any aircraft departing for
   maintenance depots (to include both DoD and contractor facilities). Maintenance crews at
   depots will inspect and transfer aircraft in accordance with paragraph 4.4.
   4.5.2. Aviation fuel purchases for aircraft en route to these facilities will be charged to the
   releasing organization. Product credited from these aircraft prior to start of depot work will
   be credited to the releasing organization. Upon release from AFMC depots and contract
   facilities, flyaway sales and sales en route will be charged to the gaining home station.
   4.5.3. Sales of aviation fuel to new production aircraft enroute to their first USAF
   assignment base will be billed to their gaining home station. The gaining organization must
   ensure that the correct information is in the BSM-E to pay for any such fuel transactions.
4.6. Deployed Aircraft. While deployed, air crews will follow the same procedures as in
garrison.
4.7. Retiring Aircraft.
   4.7.1. When retiring an aircraft, the AC or designated aircrew representative will present the
   DD Form 1896 and the AIR Card® to the representative of the 309th Aerospace
   Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG).
   4.7.2. The AMARG representative will photocopy the front side of the DD Form 1896 and
   of the AIR Card® into the appropriate box on the termination form (see attachment 2).
   4.7.3. The AC/designated representative will sign the form indicating that the DD Form
   1896 and the AIR Card® have been turned over to the AMARG representative.
   4.7.4. The AMARG representative will destroy the DD Form 1896 and the AIR Card®, then
   print and sign his name. Once the form is complete, the AMARG representative will fax a
   copy to the WRDCO identified on the termination form, provide a copy to the aircrew, and
   keep one with the aircraft records.
   4.7.5. The WRDCO will ensure that the crew ferrying the aircraft to AMARG turns the AIR
   Card® in and returns a copy of the termination form, regardless of whether the crew is
   military, government civilian, or contractor.
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                  19


  4.7.6. If the AIR Card® has a different serial number than the aircraft, the AMARG
  representative will return it to the aircrew. The representative will annotate in the space
  reserved for the AIR Card® photocopy that the aircrew did not arrive with the correct card,
  then provide the aircrew a copy of the form, fax a copy to the WRDCO identified on the
  termination form, and file a copy of the form with the aircraft records.
 20                                                               AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013


                                           Chapter 5

                               THE AIR CARD® PROGRAM

5.1. The AIR Card® Program. The U.S. Government AIR Card® is a co-branded commercial
purchase card that aircrews use to obtain fuel, fuel related supplies, and ground services at
military facilities, DLA Energy Into-plane contract sites or noncontract locations. Vendors can
electronically swipe the AIR Card®, make a mechanical imprint, or hand-scribe it onto a
commercial delivery ticket or a DD Form 1898. The AIR Card® is the only charge card which
USAF personnel are authorized to use to purchase aviation fuel, fuel related supplies and ground
services for USAF-owned aircraft. Its use is mandatory at all DLA Energy Into-Plane contract
locations that accept the AIR Card® and optional at DoD installations. AIR Cards® are
assigned to aircraft, not individuals. Each AIR Card® must remain with the aircraft whose tail
number is embossed upon it. Only USAF military and civilian personnel are authorized users of
the AIR Card®.
5.2. AIR Card® Program Hierarchy.
   5.2.1. Level 1: DoD. DLA Energy is the overall program manager for the US Government
   AIR Card®.
   5.2.2. Level 2: HQ USAF. Headquarters, Air Force, is the USAF Component Program
   Manager for the AIR Card®.
   5.2.3. Level 3: MAJCOM. Each MAJCOM establishes an APC to oversee the wing AIR
   Card® programs within that MAJCOM.
   5.2.4. Level 4: Wing. Each wing CC appoints a WRDCO to oversee the AIR Card®
   program for the wing.
5.3. Opening New Accounts and Closing Active Accounts. To open a new AIR Card®
account, the WRDCO will download the Accountable Official enrollment package from the US
Government                  AIR                Card®                Program              page
(http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?PageID=225) at the DLA Energy website
(https://www.desc.dla.mil/) and complete it according to the included instructions. The direct
link                   for                   the                  package                   is:
http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/Files/AO_Enrollment_Package_06092010.pdf . To close an
active account, the outstanding balance on all associated cards must be zero. The WRDCO can
then request that the ACC terminate the account.
5.4. Authorized Products and Services. AIR Card® users may purchase fuel products and
related ground services in direct support of the aircraft and/or the mission. The AIR Card® will
not be used purchase any goods or services for which the travel card is authorized (e.g. aircrew
transportation to/from the terminal and lodging facilities); the travel card must be used for such
purchases. See Attachment 5 for the complete list of approved purchases.
   5.4.1. In extenuating circumstances, the AIR Card® may be used to purchase meals,
   lodging, and transportation for passengers on AMC missions. The situation must meet all of
   the following conditions:
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                         21


       5.4.1.1. The passengers must be in group travel status (on group travel orders and not
       getting per diem).
       5.4.1.2. The mission must be funded by the TWCF.
       5.4.1.3. The passengers must be subject to an unscheduled stop or layover. (Refer to
       MDS-specific Operations Procedures for additional guidance to determine when aircrews
       may procure provisions for passengers)
   5.4.2. The AIR Card® is authorized for purchasing fuel at an aircraft’s home station in lieu
   of the DD Form 1896. When a unit shares facilities with a commercial airport, the unit may
   use the AIR Card® to purchase both fuel and ground services for its aircraft, provided that
   the ACC has an AIR Card® agreement in place with the Vendor.
5.5. Unauthorized Use of the AIR Card®. WRDCOs will exercise due diligence in managing
AIR Card® cards issued to their unit. Purchases made using the AIR Card® at DLA Energy
Into-Plane contract sites and commercial locations must comply with Executive Order 12731 and
the DOD Charge Card Guidebook Appendix G, "Unique Business Rules for AIR Card
Programs," 20 Jan 06. Misuse of the AIR Card® includes any use at establishments or for
purposes that are inconsistent with DoD Official Business or applicable governing regulations.
Misuse includes the illegal acceptance of gratuities. Transactions for aircrew meals, food,
beverages, and alcohol are strictly prohibited. Do not use the AIR Card® for purchases where
the government travel card is authorized. Additionally, aircrews are not authorized to
accumulate or earn points or rewards that may be commercially offered by merchants for any
AIR Card® purchases. WRDCOs, resource advisors, commanders, or other program personnel
shall immediately investigate and report any suspected card misuse to the appropriate local
investigative office and CPM. WRDCOs shall consult the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for any
taxes or fees that may be applicable at overseas airport locations. Executive Order 12731
prohibits misuse of government positions/resources and violations thereof may result in Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or civilian agency disciplinary action.
5.6. Accounts Payable.
   5.6.1. The Prompt Payment Act requires the U.S. Government to pay its debts to commercial
   vendors within 30 days of the date of the invoice or incur interest charges. Therefore, units
   should make every effort possible to pay AIR Card® invoices within 30 days. If the unit
   needs copies of transaction receipts in order to verify the charges on an invoice, it can request
   copies of those receipts from the ACC.
   5.6.2. The processes for billing and payment are different for fuel and ground services. The
   ACC passes fuel bills from vendors on an Into-Plane contract directly to DLA Energy for
   payment. The ACC pays noncontract fuel vendors and then bills DLA Energy. DLA Energy
   certifies that appropriated funds are available for payment, transmits the billing data to the
   DFAS for payment, and enters fuel-billing information into the FES.
   5.6.3. DFAS uses the Military Standard Billing System (MILSBILLS) to bill the Air Force
   for the fuel. Units whose fuel is paid through TWCF are billed directly. All other units have
   their fuel purchases paid by CAM. For ground services, the ACC bills the Air Force unit that
   received the service. The WRDCO compares the charges with receipts, and the certifying
   official certifies that the charges are correct and forwards the bill to DFAS for payment.
   DFAS then pays the bill. The ACC separates fuel purchases from non-fuel purchases on AIR
22                                                              AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013


  Card® invoices. For the fuel portions, DLA Energy San Antonio acts as the certifying
  office, and DFAS uses the MILSBILLS process to make payments. For the non-fuel
  portions, each incurring unit is the certifying office, and the appropriate DFAS office for the
  unit is the paying office. Individual units should continue processing the non-fuel portion of
  their invoice from the fuel card contractor through their established channels.
  5.6.4. Units will use a MORD to fund non-fuel charges. Invoices for ground services will be
  paid in full, unless any disputes are noted.
  5.6.5. Two different DFAS operating sites handle miscellaneous (non-fuel) AIR Card®
  charges for the Air Force.
     5.6.5.1. The following active and reserve sites will submit payments to DFAS-
     Columbus: Arnold, Dobbins, Schriever, Kirtland, Rome Labs, Hill, Patrick, Warner
     Robins, Peterson, Buckley, Vandenberg, Eglin, Kelly, Brooks, Tinker, Wright Patterson,
     Edwards and Los Angeles. In addition, the following ANG sites will submit payments to
     DFAS-Columbus: Mansfield, Fort Wayne, Great Falls, Cheyenne, Buckley, Fresno,
     Channel Island, Salt Lake City, Moffet Field, New Mexico, and Springfield IL, and
     Springfield, OH.
     5.6.5.2. All other USAF sites will submit payments to DFAS-Limestone.
     5.6.5.3. Payments to DFAS-Limestone may be faxed to DSN 869-2608 or emailed to
     dfas-li-fpd@dfas.mil.
     5.6.5.4. Payments to DFAS-Columbus may be faxed to 866-244-2894.
  5.6.6. The WRDCO will clearly stamp, write or type the following items on page one (or
  page two if there is not enough room on page one) of the Multi-Services Invoice:
     5.6.6.1. “ Received on” and the date the invoice was physically received.
     5.6.6.2. “Accepted on” and the date the invoice was accepted as accurate (charges have
     been validated). This may be combined with the above in a single statement (e.g.
     “Received and accepted on:”).
     5.6.6.3. The Accepting Official’s name, office symbol, address, and phone number.
     5.6.6.4. The Standard Document Number(s) (SDN) from the MORD(s) used for
     payment. If using more than one MORD to pay the invoice, indicate the amount to pay
     from each SDN.
     5.6.6.5. The amount requested for payment (“AMOUNT PAID”).
     5.6.6.6. If the amount paid is less than the amount due, the reason(s) why.
  5.6.7. The WRDCO will sign the invoice.        Note: Do not over-write, black out, or use
  white-out to make corrections. Use a single line through the original data so it may still be
  read and initial the change.
  5.6.8. The WRDCO will provide the finance office the following pages of the invoice; the
  finance office will fax these pages to DFAS.
     5.6.8.1. Page one.
AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                        23


       5.6.8.2. The page that includes the items above in paragraphs 5.6.5. and 5.6.6. if they are
       not on page one.
       5.6.8.3. Any additional pages that include a portion of the “Current Invoice Purchase
       Summary,” composed of the following sections: Contract Fuel Purchase Volume, Non-
       Contract Fuel Purchase Volume, and Non-Contract Ground Services Summary.
       5.6.8.4. Each page that includes itemized lists of charges (“Transaction Details”).
5.7. Disputes. When an AIR Card® invoice includes charges that the WRDCO believes are
errant, then the WRDCO should open a dispute with the ACC concerning those transactions.
However, the WRDCO should also process for payment the portion of the invoice not in dispute.
If a unit receives a past-due notice but did not receive the original invoice in question, then the
unit should request a copy of the invoice in question from the ACC for resolution. Use the
following procedures to correct transaction discrepancies prior to billing and to formally dispute
erroneously billed purchases in accordance with Defense Energy Support Center Policy (DESC-
P-13), Government Fuel Card (GFC) Program Dispute Processes, 27 May 2010.
   5.7.1. Corrective Actions at Time of Delivery. The AIR Card® user shall take the following
   actions when discrepancies occur during a purchase transaction:
       5.7.1.1. Attempt to resolve the discrepancy with the FBO whenever possible.
       Additionally, the cardholder shall notify the WRDCO of the discrepancy and advise
       whether the FBO corrected the discrepancy.
       5.7.1.2. If the FBO resolves the discrepancy at time of delivery, the WRDCO shall
       review and verify that only valid charges appear on the bill/invoice upon receipt.
       5.7.1.3. If the discrepancy is not resolved at the time of delivery, the WRDCO shall
       immediately notify the ACC and shall request error correction prior to billing. The
       WRDCO shall provide the following information with the notification.
           5.7.1.3.1. The invoice number.
           5.7.1.3.2. The customer account number.
           5.7.1.3.3. The transaction date (e.g. date of fuel purchase).
           5.7.1.3.4. An explanation of the disputed charge/billing.
           5.7.1.3.5. The purchasing aircraft MDS or Type Mission Series (TMS) and the
           aircraft tail number or Bureau Number (BUNO) number.
       5.7.1.4. In all instances, upon receiving the invoice/bill, the WRDCO shall verify the
       validity of all charges. The WRDCO shall initiate a formal dispute if billed charges are
       incorrect.
   5.7.2. AIR Card® Fuel Charge Formal Disputes. The WRDCO shall submit the minimum
   information in paragraph 5.7.1 to the DLA Energy Help Desk to negotiate AIR Card® billing
   disputes. In addition, the WRDCO shall also provide a copy of the invoice with the invalid
   transaction(s) clearly identified. For tracking purposes, WRDCOs shall direct all
   questionable fuel card charges to the DLA Energy Help Desk at 1-800-446-4950/DSN 697-
   6733/36/37/38 or by email at bsme.helpdesk@dla.mil. The DLA Energy Help Desk will
 24                                                               AFI11-253 19 AUGUST 2013


   coordinate with the DLA Energy Fuel Card Program Office Account Managers to determine
   appropriate points of contact and corrective action.
       5.7.2.1. Duplicate Billing of Fuel Purchase. Upon receipt of Help Desk notification and
       required billing information, DLA Energy shall coordinate with the ACC and CPM to
       review transaction details and confirm duplicate billing has occurred. When appropriate,
       DLA Energy and the ACC shall correct billing discrepancies with credit/debit
       transactions processed to BSM-E. This applies to both contract and non-contract
       locations.
       5.7.2.2. Erroneous Billing Due To Aircraft Transfers. If the WRDCO of the gaining unit
       notified DLA Energy of the transfer before the charges, follow the Help Desk procedures
       above. Otherwise, see paragraphs 4.4.4.1 and 4.4.4.2.
       5.7.2.3. Incorrect Invoice Data/Information. An invoice may occasionally cite an
       incorrect card number, quantity, organization, or related data. When this occurs, DLA
       Energy shall review the transaction data processed by the ACC and request a copy of the
       merchant invoice. DLA Energy will request the ACC provide a corrected invoice/bill
       upon validation of a customer dispute.
5.8. Disciplinary Guidance. The AIR Card® is for official Government business only.
Improper, fraudulent, abusive or negligent use of the AIR Card® is strictly prohibited and will
not be tolerated.
   5.8.1. Specific examples of misuse of AIR Card® include, but are not limited to, the
   following:
       5.8.1.1. Any AIR Card® transaction by an unauthorized user.
       5.8.1.2. AIR Card® fuel and ground service charges billed for a date when and/or at a
       location where the aircraft was not deployed.
       5.8.1.3. AIR Card® transactions for fuel quantities in excess of what was actually
       serviced to the aircraft.
       5.8.1.4. AIR Card® transactions for fuel quantities that exceed the aircraft capacity.
       5.8.1.5. AIR Card® transactions for unauthorized fuel products and ground services.
       5.8.1.6. Duplicate billings for identical fuel products and/or ground services to an
       aircraft.
       5.8.1.7. Acceptance by any personnel of illegal gratuities from merchants.
       5.8.1.8. Any AIR Card® transaction not performed as official DoD business.
