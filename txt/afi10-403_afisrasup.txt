SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision aligns the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency
supplement with current AFI 10-403. It establishes AF ISR Agency unique requirements for all
deployment operations. This revision also provides more detailed guidance.
1.4.6.3.2.HQ AF ISR Agency/A4X is the OPR for agency Logistics Module (LOGMOD) pilot
unit management.
1.4.6.8. (Added)HQ AF ISR Agency/A4X is designated as agency guidance OPR for
deployments and Integrated Deployment Systems (IDS).

1.4.7.HQ AF ISR Agency/A3XF is the OPR for Unit Type Code (UTC) Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK). Identifies Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) Statements, Functional Manager (FM) letters, and the AF War and Mobilization Plan
(WMP II), part 2. UTC availability and Mission Capability (MISCAP) statements are distributed
to units via e-mail, message traffic, letter, or FAX.
1.4.7.1.HQ AF ISR Agency/A3XF is OPR for management of Time-Phased Force Deployment
Data (TPFDD). HQ AF ISR Agency/A3XF distributes unit extracts of Operations Plans
(OPlan), as required, to Wing and Center HQ level. The Wing and Center HQ may forward
extracts to subordinate units.
1.4.7.4. (Added)HQ AF ISR Agency/A3XF is the OPR for Status of Resources and Training
(SORTs) reporting and AEF Readiness Reporting Tool (ART).
1.4.7.5. (Added)HQ AF ISR Agency/A3XF is the Office of Functional Area Manager (FAM)
Oversight (OFAMO). The OFAMO establishes and directs protocols to ensure appointed UTC
FAMs are capable of efficiently and effectively conducting their responsibilities. Serve as the
critical interface between FAMs and the other staff readiness support offices (logistics,
manpower, and personnel).
1.4.8.6. (Added)HQ AF ISR Agency/A1XF is the OPR for 365 day extended deployments.
A1XF receives taskings from HQ AFPC/DPWSJ, checks funding source, sends to appropriate
Wing or Center UDM for release approval, and notifies HQ AFPC/DPWSJ of approval or
disapproval to deploy.
1.5.1.3.1.AF ISR Agency geographically separated units (GSUs), at a minimum, must be able to
demonstrate the capability to generate both the release and transport of deploying equipment and
personnel to the host’s aggregate location at the required times provided by the host base for
exercises or operational deployments.
1.6.1.8.Once a month, AF ISR Agency Wing/Center Deployment Managers (W/CDMs) will
collect deployment information from subordinate units providing: 1) how many personnel are
deployed from individual units (e.g. 70 IW has 250 personnel deployed), and 2) in what quantity
and where are deployed personnel located (e.g. 25 pax, Kuwait). The W/CDMs will transmit this
information to AF ISR Agency A1 Readiness Branch by either JWICS or SIPRNet email
AFISRAgency_A1Readiness@afisra.ic.gov or AFISRAgency/A1@acc.af.smil.mil, respectively.
The use of a check list by W/CDMs will ensure in- and out-processing procedures are briefed to
members prior to deploying and ensure appropriate duty status codes are updated by the CSS if
deploying on Non-Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) orders
1.6.1.12.Unit commanders will submit a current copy of their UDM Appointment Letter to the
unit’s managing Wing/Center Readiness Office.
1.6.1.14.Units will use LOGMOD and LOGMOD Stand Alone (LSA) to the maximum extent
possible to manage personnel and UTC’s.
1.6.1.22.1. (Added)Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is the final approval authority for all
Unit Line Number (ULN) tasking requests for UTCs assigned against General Defense
Intelligence Program (GDIP) billets, see attachment 18, GDIP Flowchart.
1.6.1.22.2. (Added)National Security Agency (NSA) is the final approval authority for all ULN
tasking requests for UTCs assigned against Consolidated Cryptological Program (CCP) billets,
AFI10-403 _AFISRASUP 30 JULY 2009                                                               3

Program (DCP), billets assigned to field sites, see attachment 19, CCP/ISSP/DCP Billet (Field
Sites) Tasking Flowchart.
1.6.1.22.3. (Added)Wing and Center commanders are the final approval authority for all ULN
tasking requests for UTCs assigned against CCP/ISSP/DCP billets assigned to their immediate
command staff. See attachment 20, CCP/ISSP/DCP Billet (NSA HQ, HQ AF ISR Agency,
Wing/Center, Group, Squadron Commanders and their Immediate Staff) Tasking Flowchart.
1.6.1.22.4. (Added)The HQ AF ISR Agency two-letters are the final approval authority for
ULN tasking requests for UTCs assigned against NIP billets assigned to their directorate. See
attachment 20, CCP/ISSP/DCP Billet (NSA HQ, HQ AF ISR Agency, Wing/Center, Group,
Squadron Commanders, and their Immediate Staff) Tasking Flowchart.
1.6.1.22.5. (Added)The host base MAJCOM or host base IDO can direct more stringent
guidelines regarding deployment policy. Any unresolved disagreement between the unit and host
base IDO concerning deployment policy will be elevated to the next level in both the unit’s and
IDO’s chains of command.
2.24.1.The Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) Table (formerly AFWUS and UTC
Availability) will provide ULN/UTC’s tasked against units. All ULN/UTCs identified are valid
taskings whether listed on a unit’s Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement or not.
2.24.1.1. (Added)The normal AF ISR Agency deployment tasking process is covered in
attachment 16, Tasking Process Flowchart. Subordinate units will send notification within seven
duty days of any taskings/deployment received to their respective Wing/Center Readiness Office.
2.31.6.Non-pilot units must coordinate any equipment discrepancies with the pilot unit and
applicable FAM for all equipment not listed in the standard UTC or equipment no longer
required in the standard UTC.
3.18.2.1. (Added)Reclamas approved by unit commanders are sent to the appropriate
wing/center for approval/disapproval. The wing/center will forward reclamas to the MAJCOM
FAM for approval/disapproval. See attachment 17, Reclama Process Flowchart.

Type Code (UTC) are accounted for IAW AF Manual 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 22, Section
H & Vol. 2, Part 13, Chapter 8.
4.6.3.3. (Added)The equipment must have the correct use code in the supply system.
5.4.3.2.AF ISR Agency personnel tasked by support agencies outside the Air Force must ensure
their unit’s CSS updates their duty status to receive deployment credit and obtain eligibility for
deployment benefits (e.g. hazard duty pay, etc.).
5.4.6.1. (Added)AF ISR Agency personnel assigned to MIP billets will use the procedures
outlined in AFI 10-401, Chapter 9.19 (Volunteer Guidance) when volunteering for an AEF
tasking. Leadership must understand once a tasking is generated and the volunteering individual
is unable to meet deployment requirements, the unit is still required to provide someone to fill
the tasking.
5.4.6.2. (Added)Procedures for AEF augmentation using National Intelligence Program (NIP)
personnel. Personnel assigned to NIP billets may volunteer for an AEF tasking using procedures

for unit nomination.
5.4.6.3. (Added)The appropriate Wing/Center will forward GDIP tasking requests to
recommended/nominated unit commanders.
5.4.6.3.1. (Added)Wing/Centers have three duty days to response to AF ISR Agency/A3XF
with a nomination either to support the requirement or to start reclama procedures.
5.4.6.3.1.1. (Added)Unit Commanders determine if an AEF tasking request can be supported
and send an impact statement via e-mail to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)/Defense
Intelligence Resource Management Office (DIRMO) for final evaluation with the following
information and format:

HQ AF ISR Agency, and 3) Wing/Group/Squadron commanders and their immediate staff.
5.4.6.4.2. (Added)AF ISR Agency will request subordinate AF ISR Agency CCP/ISSP/DCP
personnel on an individual augmentation basis spread across the AEF cycle. (Augmentation will

augmentation support for CCP/ISSP/DCP personnel.
5.4.6.4.3.3. (Added)MJ1/NSA will inform AF ISR Agency of their decision within four duty
days of receipt of the Wing/Center message. If approved, AF ISR Agency will coordinate with
