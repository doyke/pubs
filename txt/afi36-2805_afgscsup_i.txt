                                             Chapter 1

     GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS

1.1. Nominating Procedures. Commanders at all levels actively advertise the nomination
procedures for special trophies and awards. Commanders verify achievements and nominate
those qualified for appropriate awards. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders, vice
commanders, or executive directors indorse nominations on their personnel. When nominating
persons or units assigned to other commands, commanders acquire by letter, the coordination of
the commander or vice commander of the owning MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. Submit
nominations to AFPC/DPSIDR, with the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander's
coordination.
1.2. Air Force-level Awards. Air Force functional activities or private organizations establish
Air Force-level awards. The designated OPR and the Air Force Uniforms and Recognition
Branch (AF/A1SRU) approve implementing instructions. Notify AF/A1SRU when the award is
terminated.
     1.2.1. The experts in a given function will manage functional awards. Functional managers
     will ensure nomination write-ups are limited to two pages, using the Air Force Form 1206,
     Nomination for Award. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AF/A1SRU.
     Functional areas requiring the use of base visits to determine award winners will limit such
     visits to one visit per base per award.
1.3. Wartime Guidance. Programs governed by this instruction will continue during conflicts
below the level of declared war. In the event that a national emergency is declared by Congress
or the President of the United States, programs sponsored by Headquarters (HQ) USAF may be
suspended. The Air Force will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored by
private organizations.
1.4. Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. Commanders at any level may
establish special trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and
units or organizations. Include such recognition programs in appropriate base supplements.
     1.4.1. Awards may be named in honor of living or deceased Air Force military members and
     Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians who had honorable records and made
     significant contributions to the Air Force or to the functional area in which the award is being
     established. Consider individuals of prominence or those whose careers or actions were
     important and meaningful to the function in which the award will be established.
     Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the individual to ensure the individual
     is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When an award is
     established, the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the
     appropriate commander or vice commander, to                 AFPC/DPSIDR notifying of the
     establishment of the award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or
     instruction. Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring and maintaining the
     integrity of special trophies and awards programs. All awards named for individuals will be
     established only in accordance with this instruction. The requirements of this instruction are
     mandatory when considering memorial-type awards. List what sources were reviewed to
     perform the background check and that verification has been made that no derogatory

  information was found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their

  1.4.3. Do not duplicate existing special trophies and awards programs in either name or
  criteria (recognizing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports or a citation

  will not duplicate elements of existing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601V1,
  Budget Guidance and Procedures, for further guidance regarding funding for award
  elements. Awards must be of nominal value. Awards may not be redeemable for cash,

  achievements make a significant contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air
  Force.
  1.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) On-the-Spot Recognition Awards. It is important to recognize
  military and      civilian personnel who, by dedicated individual effort, facilitate successful
  accomplishment of a particular program, function or mission. This type of program provides
  senior leadership with an informal means to show special recognition of, and appreciate, a
  job well done.

        awarded, accomplishment (i.e. Airmen of the Quarter), and the balance-on-hand. Store
        items separately from similar items bought with different fund-types such as booster club
        funds.
        1.4.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Recognition awards should not be presented for any of the
        following reasons: in lieu of farewell gifts; performance of routine duties; as mementos,
        commemorative, or personal gifts; or morale-building purposes.

        order, maintain, and track distribution of the Heart Link Coin.
        1.4.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) Inspector General (IG) presentation coin is intended solely
        for the purpose of recognizing the contribution of special or superior performance during

1.5. Travel for Military Members or Department of the Air Force Civilians. Air Force
military or Department of the Air Force civilian personnel selected for an award listed in this

selected to receive an award, the unit commander attends the presentation ceremony to accept the
award on behalf of the unit.
1.6. Travel for Non-Military Members or Non-Department of the Air Force
Civilians. When individuals who are neither military members nor Department of the Air Force
civilians are selected as recipients of these awards, invitational travel will be authorized so they
may attend the presentation ceremony. Refer to the AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, for
instructions and limitations on travel reimbursements for members and employees and invitation
travel orders for family members and non-Department of the Air Force civilians.
     1.6.1. MAJCOM commanders or vice commanders are authorized to approve spouse travel
     for award recipients assigned to their command. This approval authority may not be further
     delegated. When spouse travel is approved, invitational travel authorization orders will be

     spouse, the member may elect to invite one family member to attend the award ceremony.
1.7. Funds. Authorize funds for reasonable costs of trophies, plaques, and so forth for
presentation purposes. Do not authorize cash awards.
     1.7.1. Use appropriated funds for trophies and awards to recognize mission accomplishment.
     Such awards include Junior Officer, Noncommissioned Officer (NCO), or Airman of the
     Quarter or Year, functional work area, and so on. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1. This
AFI36-2805_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JANUARY 2014                                                           9


   authority does not apply to awards for employees who are paid from nonappropriated funds
   (NAF) according to policies regarding the use of NAF.
   1.7.2. Do not use NAFs to supplement awards paid from appropriated funds. When
   appropriated funds are not available or are not authorized, the commander may use NAF to
   buy trophies and awards, if authorized by AFI 34201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds
   (NAFs). Do not use NAFs for awards to civilian personnel who are paid from appropriated
   funds.

1.8. Air Force Recognition Ribbon (AFRR) Eligibility. Award this ribbon to recipients
selected as the overall winners of Air Force-level/Air Force functional special trophies and
awards. Any recipient selected for an eligible award since 12 October 1980, when the AFRR

AFI’s listed in Attachment 4.
   1.8.1. The following military members wear the ribbon:

       special trophies and awards listed in this instruction.
       1.8.1.2. Named individuals or members of small teams who receive a functional Air
       Force-level special trophy or award managed by the functional area of responsibility and

       competitions sponsored by a MAJCOM whose award is listed in this instruction.

   for a specific purpose (i.e., Tiger Team) or an operation (i.e., bomber crew, security forces
   contingent, etc.) that is not constituted as a USAF organization by a DAF letter. As such, a
   team is not entitled to a lineage and honors history or an emblem. The determining factor in
   eligibility is either individual achievement or achievement of a small team in which each
   team member’s contribution was integral to mission accomplishment, as opposed to
   organizational groups in which the contribution of individuals could vary widely.
   1.8.3. Recipients must be determined by Air Force-wide competition in that functional
   specialty.

       1.8.6.2. Members assigned to such cited organizations, units, or activities. Example:

       organization is awarded the ribbon.

   4 require approval from AF/A1.

   as a 12 OAY. For example, the 2009 12 OAY serve from September 2009 through
   September 2010. Therefore, the 2009 MAJCOM and DRU nominees would need
   retainability through 30 September 2010. The annual AFPC/DPSI nomination message
   outlines procedures to follow in obtaining retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU
   nominees who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Skills Management
   Branch, Reenlistments Section (AFPC/DPSOAE), for assistance regarding retainability.
   Failure on the part of the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU to meet retainability requirements on
