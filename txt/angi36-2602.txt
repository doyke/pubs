   retainer is unable to attend.
8.4. Initial Certification Training.
   8.4.1. Recruiter certification is a formal and cumulative training process that incorporates in-
   residence training, on-the-job training and a one-year phase Job Qualification Standard (JQS)
   training.
       8.4.1.1. Initial Phase Training is divided into three timed phases. Phase training assists
       trainee in development of sound recruiting practices and an understanding of recruiting
       concepts; refer to 8R000-CJQS for information on timed phase training. A recruiter or
       retainer will enter phase training after successful completion of the Basic Recruiting

       completion or evaluation dates require NGB/A1YO coordination and approval.
   8.4.2. Initial standards and expectations will be documented by supervisor within 15 days
   following individual’s graduation from Basic Recruiting Course. This will be signed by the
   supervisor and trainee and recorded on AF Form 623a. Documentation will include, but not
   limited to: Duties, responsibilities, expectations, and mandatory training and position
   specific training requirements.
   8.4.3. R&R personnel certification applies to ROSs, ROMs, RRNCOs and Production
   Recruiters on initial assignment to recruiting. Successful completion of training is certified
   by the RRS.
   8.4.4. Upon completion of each phase, the trainer will conduct a formal evaluation of the
   trainee’s progress. The evaluation is documented in AF IMT 803, Report of Task Evaluation
   and systems training record.
       8.4.4.1. Evaluations must be accomplished no later than ten (10) workdays after the
       completion of the training phase.
       8.4.4.2. All tasks for the current phase should be certified in the CJQS before moving to
       the next phase of training.
       8.4.4.3. Training strengths, weaknesses and task reviews for the next phases are
       documented on the AF IMT 803.

   8.4.5. ROS must be briefed on training progress in cases where the ROS is not the primary
   trainer.
8.5. Unsatisfactory Progress.
   8.5.1. Unsatisfactory training results, as documented in AF IMT 803, signify that the trainee
   should be placed into intensified training as indicated below.
   8.5.2. Intensified Training is designed to overcome deficiencies within specific training
   objectives. It is utilized when a trainee exhibits an inability to fully grasp a concept or
   demonstrate a task successfully. It is initiated when ROS or ROM conduct formal
   counseling and recommend trainee for a 30 day training extension. This training must be
   used when an extension to phase training is approved. The methodology for employing
   intensified training includes closer supervision, repetitive task performance, and creation of
   more training opportunities. Intensified training is applicable to any recruiting or retention
   trainee.
       8.5.2.1. The ROS or ROM, with the assistance of the trainer and trainee, will develop a
       30 day training plan designed to overcome training deficiencies.
       8.5.2.2. The RRS will conduct formal counseling when placing a ROS/ROM/RRNCO
       trainee on a 30 day training extension for intensified training. The RRS, with the
       assistance of the trainer and trainee, will develop a 30 day training plan designed to
       overcome training deficiencies.
       8.5.2.3. Intensified Training is authorized 30 day extensions for Phases I and II. This
       extension is initiated by the ROS, in writing, and recorded in the trainees AF Form 623,
       Individual Training Record Folder and forwarded to the RRS. RRS will initiate an
       extension if the trainee is a ROS, ROM or RRNCO.
       8.5.2.4. If the trainee’s progress is unsatisfactory after any 30 day extension, the
       assistance of the RRS and/or DOS is required. If training fails to improve the deficiency,
       the supervisor will consider the trainee for dismissal IAW ANGI 36-101, Chapter 8.
       NGB/A1Y should be notified as appropriate.
       8.5.2.5. Upon successful completion of intensified training, the trainee may move into
       the next training phase or may be certified, as appropriate.
8.6. Certification.
   8.6.1. Upon completion of phase training, the trainer determines if the trainee is eligible for
   certification by conducting an in-depth competency review of CJQS 8R000 to ensure all
   tasks are certified. Task competency is evaluated to determine eligibility for certification.
   8.6.2. Trainer will submit a recommendation for certification to the RRS, through the ROS,
   if applicable, once it is determined that the recruiter is eligible for certification. Once all
   formal and initial certification training objectives are met the incumbents in these positions
   are considered qualified.
   8.6.3. Trainees who successfully complete phase training will be certified within 30 days
   after the final evaluation. Certification is accomplished only after the RRS validates the
   trainee is proficient in all tasks listed in the CJQS.
ANGI36-2602 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   29


   8.6.4. At nine months, trainee may be evaluated for exceptional progression and the trainer
   may validate proficiency in all applicable CJQS tasks and recommend early certification.
8.7. Production Evaluation.
   8.7.1. Production evaluation is conducted at a minimum, twice a year to review
   recruiter/retainer performance and when requested by higher authority. It can be utilized to
   determine if sub-standard performance is related to a training deficiency. Production
   evaluation requirements are performed to:
       8.7.1.1. Ensure recruiting and retention personnel meet monthly recruiting goals set forth
       in the standards and expectations.

       personal interview, record analysis, testing, state R&R plans, Parthenons, funds
       management, MEPS flow applications, etc.).
   8.7.4. Counseling.
       8.7.4.1. Document counseling sessions on AF Form 174, Record of Individual
       Counseling.
       8.7.4.2. Counseling sessions must clearly state observations and findings. Discussion

       areas, should they exist.
       8.7.4.3. If a training deficiency is discovered, determine and implement training
       designed to overcome the deficiency and target a projected completion date with the
       trainee.
   8.7.5. Completion of Production Evaluations.
       8.7.5.1. NGB/A1Y, RRS and/or ROS must ensure the production evaluations are
       completed in a timely manner and continuous follow-up action is accomplished.

       proper authority (i.e. NGB/A1Y, DOS, etc.) as the situation warrants. File original AF
       Form 174 in the trainee’s Personnel Information File (PIF).
8.8. Extension to Phase III training.
 30                                                        ANGI36-2602 21 FEBRUARY 2012

   8.8.3. The RRS will certify the trainee or recommend reassignment or dismissal at the end of
   the 30 day extension.
8.9. Deficiency, Supplemental and Re-Certification Training.
   8.9.1. Deficiency Training.
      8.9.1.1. This training is used when the performance of qualified or certified personnel
      falls below the predetermined standard and it is believed that the deficiency is due to
      factors which can be overcome through training.
      8.9.1.2. Upon discovery of a training related deficiency, the supervisor will notify the
      trainee, in writing, that he or she is being placed in deficiency training.
          8.9.1.2.1. The supervisor or trainer will develop a more comprehensive training
          program for the trainee, which at a minimum will include tasks, processes and

      performance to standard.
