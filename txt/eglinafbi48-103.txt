1. General. RAM and RPDs have many practical uses in medicine, research, construction, non-
destructive inspection, armament development and testing, and military operations, but present a
hazard if used improperly because they produce ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing
radiation causes microscopic damage to living tissue resulting in cancer, tumors and genetic
damage at low doses. High doses may result in skin burns and radiation sickness. To minimize
exposures to ionizing radiation, the federal government has established dose limits for workers
and the public. In addition to these dose limits, all DoD personnel are directed to maintain
exposures to ionizing radiation as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). This means that no
practice involving exposure to radiation shall be adopted unless there is sufficient benefit to the
exposed individual or to achieving necessary military objectives to offset the harm it may cause.
In those cases where the use of ionizing radiation is justified, the magnitude of individual doses
and the number of people exposed shall be kept ALARA, economic, military and social factors
being taken into account.
2. Objective. The purpose of this program is to support operational requirements involving the
use of RAM and RPDs while ensuring the health and safety of personnel. Specific objectives are
to: 1) maintain exposures to workers and the public ALARA; 2) enhance installation security;
and 3) ensure compliance with federal/state law and DoD/AF policy.

   contact the IRSO.
   4.3. At least 30 days prior (and as early as possible), notify the IRSO of planned receipt
   and/or use of RAM or RPDs.
   4.4. Targets used on operational ranges subject to severe damage or destruction shall not
   contain RAM, including exempted materials (e.g. radium gauges), unless specifically
   allowed to do so by an Air Force permit or the RICS. Range authorities shall develop and
   implement procedures to screen all targets that potentially contain and/or suspect to contain
   RAM.
   4.5. Units shall not procure facility radioluminescent exit signs (e.g. emergency exit signs
   containing tritium) and markers without written approval from HQ AFMSA/SG3PB.
5. Usage, Storage and Security of RAM or RPDs:
   5.1. All organizations and personnel (including contractors) conducting activities on Eglin
   AFB are required to obtain approval from the installation commander or IRSO prior to using
   or storing RAM or RPDs onto Eglin AFB.
   5.2. All non-medical RPDs must be evaluated by the IRSO for potential hazards prior to first
   time use. Therefore the user, supervisor, or unit RSO should send a request to 96
   AMDS/SGPB at least 30 days prior to the desired use date.
   5.3. All medical RPDs must be evaluated by a qualified biomedical equipment technician
   and in some cases a medical physicist prior to first time use AFI 48-148.
   5.4. RAM or RPDs may only be stored/used in areas approved by the IRSO. New requests
   should be submitted to the IRSO at least 30 days prior to the desired date.
   5.5. The IRSO shall be contacted prior to any facility modifications.
   5.6. RAM shall not be accessible to the general public, and may only be made available to
   authorized personnel who are trained on proper use.
6. Transfer and Transport of RAM or RPDs:
   6.1. Permittees who desire to transfer RAM to another organization must obtain a copy of
   the receiving organization’s RAM permit or NRC license, and verify they can receive the
   item being shipped. Request assistance from the IRSO as required.
   6.2. Prior to shipping RAM ensure the requirements of 49 CFR are met. This is usually
   accomplished in coordination with the 96 LRS.

       ALARA INVESTIGATION LEVELS FOR THE PERSONNEL DOSIMETRY
                              PROGRAM

A2.1. ALARA Investigation Levels in Tables A2.2 are based on 10 CFR 20, Subpart C,
Occupational Dose Limits, and the guidance in AFI 40-201 (2007), ―Establish investigation
levels to ensure personnel exposures are maintained ALARA. Investigation levels should be
developed for each occupational group and are intended to identify adverse trends, assess their
causes and implement appropriate corrective actions.‖
A2.2. The IRSO shall investigate any exposure that exceeds the levels established in Tables
A2.1 or A2.2. In instances where the dosimeter is lost, units must provide documentation
regarding the lost dosimeter and any additional information that may indicate a health concern.
A2.3. The IRSO may conduct additional investigations if any received dose is inconsistent with
past results.
A2.4. The IRSO may request dose records information from any contractor conducting ionizing
radiation activities on Eglin AFB.

                     AREAS OF EXCLUSIVE FEDERAL JURISDICTION

The area commonly known as ―Eglin Main Base,‖ is encompassed by the aptly-named North,
East and West gates and the Choctawhatchee Bay. It is exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction.
In addition, exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction extends beyond Eglin Main Base to include
an area bounded on the East and South by Eglin’s boundary lines; to the East by a line drawn to
extend the Fort Walton Beach Golf Course’s eastern boundary to the North approximately 3.5
miles; and from this point due East to Eglin’s Eastern boundary line, thereby forming the
Northern extent of exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction. Described another way, the Eglin-
managed property within Township 1 South, Range 23 West, Sections 7 to 36; and Township 1
South, Range 24 West, Sections 12, 13, 24 and 25 are exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction.
There are limited exceptions to these generally-described areas. Excepted from exclusive federal
legislative jurisdiction in these areas are several state and county roads (including but not limited
to Highways 85 and 189), the Northwest Florida Regional Airport (formerly the Okaloosa
Regional Airport) and the Research Engineering and Education Facility (formerly the Graduate
Engineering Research Center). These areas are concurrent legislative jurisdiction. All other
properties managed by Eglin Air Force Base are proprietary jurisdiction.
The map in Figure A2.1 indicates areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction in red (outer boundary), and areas
of concurrent jurisdiction in yellow (marked roadways).
