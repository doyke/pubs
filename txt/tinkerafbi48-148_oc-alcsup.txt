                                            Chapter 2

                   RAM, RPDS AND RADIATION EXPOSURE LIMITS

2.1. Radioactive material (RAM). RAM includes any item that emits radiation without
external power. Examples are byproduct, source and special nuclear material as defined in the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 10, Parts 30, 40 and 70. Products distributed as exempt
by a manufacturer licensed to distribute to exempt persons do not require a permit, if used for
their intended purpose. Any unusual activities involving these sources, such as attempting to
remove the RAM from the item or accumulating large quantities of these items for storage may
require a permit. Although there are no administrative controls over these items, they may
require controlled disposal. If there is any doubt as to the requirement for a permit or the proper
method of disposal, contact the IRSO for guidance.
2.2. A radiation-producing device (RPD). RPD is any piece of equipment that emits ionizing
radiation, regardless of intent, when energized by an external power source. Examples include
medical and industrial x-ray machines, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence units, scanning and
transmission electron microscopes and particle accelerators.        In general, any device that
accelerates electrons or other atomic particles with a potential difference of 10,000 volts or
greater and produces x-radiation, either intentionally or unintentionally, may require an RPD
permit. Some exceptions are television monitors, cathode ray tubes and video display terminals
which are manufactured under the strict requirements of 21 CFR 1020.10. If there is any doubt
as to the requirement for a permit, contact the IRSO for guidance. Note: RAM or RAM sources
that are excluded for permit, license or IRSO authorization for use must be used for their
intended purposes. Any unusual activities involving these sources, such as attempting to remove
the radioisotope(s) from the item or accumulating large quantities of these items for storage may
require a permit, license or IRSO authorization. Although there are no administrative controls
over these items, they may require controlled disposal. If there is any doubt as to the
requirement for a permit, license or IRSO authorization or the proper method of disposal, contact
the IRSO for guidance. The possession and use of Generally Licensed Devices (items that
contain RAM) distributed under 10 CFR 31 must comply with certain NRC and USAF
requirements. Purchase, acquisition, receipt, storage, use, shipping, recycling and disposal of
such devices will be coordinated with the IRSO.
2.3. Radiation Exposure Limits
   2.3.1. Personnel Exposure. Personnel who work with RAM or RPDs may be exposed to
   radiation during the course of their employment. The goal of the radiation protection
   program at TAFB is to maintain all radiation exposures ALARA. However, it may be
   impossible to completely eliminate all radiation exposure. As a result, it is important to
   understand the procedures used to monitor for radiation exposure and also the significance of
   a radiation dose obtained during routine work activities.
   2.3.2. Dose limits. 10 CFR Part 20 specify the maximum permissible dose limits:

                                           Chapter 3

                                       MONITORING

3.1. The BEF will ascertain that ionizing radiation exposure monitoring is conducted to
document the radiation dose received by employees working in environments where RAM and
RPDs are used, handled, stored or disposed of to ensure and maintain personnel exposures
ALARA according to the requirements of AFMAN 48-125.
   3.1.1. The supervisor, or designated radiation dosimeter monitor, of a newly assigned worker
   has the responsibility to request radiation monitoring for that individual. Monitoring shall be
   required if the worker shall be located in an area designated by the IRSO as a potential
   radiation hazard area or if, because of the assigned duties, the individual is classified as a
   radiation worker requiring dosimetry.
   3.1.2. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) will be furnished by the BEF. The shop
   supervisors will obtain other dosimetric devices as needed, i.e. Electronic Personal
   Dosimeters. There are three types of badges and depending on the type of radiation work
   performed, one, two or possibly all three will be issued to a single individual.
      3.1.2.1. The first type is called a whole body badge as it is designed to measure the
      radiation exposure to the entire body. The whole body badge is typically worn
      somewhere between the waist and the shoulders (i.e., waistband, collar or shirt pocket),
      as that is the location of highest expected whole body radiation dose. In this location, the
      badge will provide a measure of the radiation exposure to the internal organs and the
      gonads. Since this badge is designed to provide a measure of the radiation exposure to
      the whole body, it should always be worn so as to be exposed to the same radiation
      environment as the body any other badges issued are worn in addition to the whole body
      badge.
      3.1.2.2. The second type of badge is called the collar badge worn on the shirt collar. It is
      designed to provide a representative sample of the radiation exposure to the critical
      organs above the shoulders, i.e., the thyroid in the neck and the lens of the eye. When a
      protective shield such as a lead apron is worn, the collar badge is placed outside the
      protective shield, not under it. Results recorded on a collar badge are often reported as a
      "head" dose.
      3.1.2.3. The third type of badge is called an extremity badge or finger badge. It is worn
      like a ring on a finger of the hand which is most likely to be exposed to the radiation. If
      the source of radiation is typically held in the hand, the ring should be worn with the top
      portion turned around facing the palm and the radiation. However, if the radiation
      originates from a remote source such as an x-ray diffraction unit and the hand is likely to
      be exposed from the back, the ring should be worn in the usual manner.
   3.1.3. All radiation badges should be worn while working in a designated radiation use area.
   The badges should be put on before beginning work and removed after leaving the radiation
   use area. When not being worn, the badges must be stored on a rack or board of some kind
   in a radiation-free environment along with a control badge. This location is normally called a
   "control board. The control badge always remains on the control board. Its purpose is to
 16                                       TINKERAFBI48-148_OC-ALCSUP_I 9 May 2014


   measure the background radiation level in the storage area and while the badges are in
   transient so that this radiation exposure can be subtracted from the measured values on the
   personnel badges since this exposure represents radiation not received by the badge while
   worn in the work environment. Badges must never be taken home or stored in any other
   location such as desk drawers or attached to lab coats. Badges should also never be worn
   when undergoing medical radiation procedures such as diagnostic x-ray or dental
   examinations, nuclear medicine evaluations or radiation therapy treatments. Badges will
   provide an accurate measure of the radiation to which an individual is exposed only if they
   are worn and stored properly. If a badge is lost or damaged an investigation will be
   performed by the IRSO to estimate the exposure actually received during that monitoring
   period. The individual to whom the badge was issued shall be required to sign a statement
   explaining the circumstances of the loss or damage.
   3.1.4. Each individual to be monitored shall be provided with a radiation safety briefing to
   include an explanation concerning proper wearing and storage of the dosimeter and the right
   to review the dosimetry results each month or quarter.
   3.1.5. The TLDs will be collected by the BEF quarterly (or monthly for special monitoring,
   i.e. pregnant workers) and processed by the AF RDL. Monitoring results will be provided
   and handled as descried here:
      3.1.5.1. AF Form 1499 will be submitted by the AF RDL to the BEF documenting the
      quarterly (monthly) dose exposures to individuals. The IRSO/BEF will forward copies to
      Unit RSOs/Supervisors, using signed receipt, for availability to employees monitored.
      3.1.5.2. Each Unit and the BEF will maintain the AF Form 1499 until AF Form 1527,
      Annual Occupational Exposure History to Ionizing Radiation, is received from the AF
      RDL and copies are forwarded by the BEF to Unit RSOs/Supervisors, using signed
      receipt, who in turn will provide the forms to employees monitored in the TLD Program.
      The Unit RSO/Supervisor will obtain the signed receipt from each individual for which
      there is an AF Form 1527 in their Unit and forward signed receipt(s) to the IRSO/BEF
      within 10 business days after the Unit receives the forms. For Guard or Reserve Units,
      this may be extended to a drill weekend. The IRSO shall retain the AF Form 1527 IAW
      AFI 48-148.
      3.1.5.3. The Unit RSO/Supervisor will inform the IRSO/BEF of any mistakes on the
      forms promptly so they can be corrected.
   3.1.6. The supervisor shall not permit anyone to enter a radiation use area or work with
   RAM or RPDs unless that individual has been designated a radiation worker, been properly
   briefed and has been issued a dosimeter, if appropriate. Visitors to any restricted areas shall
   be accompanied by persons knowledgeable about the protection and safety measures in the
   area and must be provided adequate information and instruction before entering the area.
3.2. Periodic monitoring will be conducted with portable ion chamber radiation survey
instruments by the BEF and other authorized personnel IAW AF Technical Orders, Manuals
and Instructions.

                                            Chapter 4

                                   ALARA AND TRAINING

4.1. Background. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific evidence
which suggests that no level of radiation exposure is entirely risk-free. It is a policy which states
that although there are acceptable, conservative levels of radiation exposure specified by federal
regulations which offer a low risk of adverse health effects compared to the other hazards of life
and occupation, it is prudent to make every effort to reduce exposures to the lowest levels
reasonably achievable, thereby lowering the health risk associated with that exposure. In fact,
individual and cumulative radiation exposures must be maintained as close to zero as possible

                                          Chapter 6

                                       RAM WASTE

6.1. Management of Radioactive Waste.
   6.1.1. Generation of Waste. The primary goal of all users is to minimize the accumulation
   of radioactive waste to those items which cannot be disposed of in any other manner. One
   method is to avoid combining radioactive and non-radioactive waste such as paper products
   and ordinary laboratory waste. Care should be exercised not to inadvertently dispose of
   radioactive waste without regard to proper disposal procedures.
   6.1.2. Segregation. An important aspect of proper waste disposal is segregation of waste,
   which may involve separating:
      6.1.2.1. Solids from liquids. An example would be the separation of solid check sources
      from liquid scintillation vials.
      6.1.2.2. High activity from low activity radionuclides.
      6.1.2.3. Long half-life from short half-life radionuclides. Short half-life material may be
      decayed in storage and subsequently disposed of as non-radioactive waste if approved by
      the IRSO in writing.
      6.1.2.4. Different categories of material. An example would be the separation of alpha
      emitting material from gamma emitting material.
   6.1.3. Containerization. Supervisors of units with containers of RAM (i.e. barrels, crates,
   drums, boxes, etc.) will ensure that each container is labeled with the minimum:
      6.1.3.1. National stock number
      6.1.3.2. Part number
      6.1.3.3. Nomenclature
      6.1.3.4. Quantity
      6.1.3.5. Radionuclide
      6.1.3.6. Activity
6.2. Excess Waste Disposal.
   6.2.1. Excess or unserviceable RAM will be disposed of IAW AFI 40-201. Supervisors,
   Unit RSOs and/or Permit RSOs will contact the BEF (i.e. the IRSO) to ensure safe handling
   and shipping meet NRC, DoT, DoD and AF requirements.
   6.2.1. (OC-ALC) The 776 MXSS/MXDEB will serve as the RAM program manager for
   OC-ALC only, coordinate with the IRSO and OC-ALC Groups to determine type, quantity
   and frequency of disposal shipments of RAM that need to be transferred to the Air Force
   Radiation Recycling and Disposal (AFRRAD) Branch (88 ABW/CEV) at Wright-Patterson
   AFB, OH. The 776 MXSS/MXDEB will also serve as the facility manager of building 2137.
TINKERAFBI48-148_OC-ALCSUP_I 9 May 2014                                                    23


     6.2.1.1. (Added-OC-ALC) Relay instructions to the group POC regarding when to
     deliver RAM to the designated staging area when notified that quantities are approaching
     a shop’s space limitations.
     6.2.1.2. (Added-OC-ALC) Coordinate with IRSO to schedule general area surveys
     when RAM components are transferred to the staging facility and when RAM is
     packaged and certified for shipment by AFRRAD.
     6.2.1.3. (Added-OC-ALC) Ensure RAM is segregated by isotope within the designated
     staging facility to allow for easier transfer.
  6.2.2. Owning organizations will provide BEF information as required in AFI 40-201,
  section A10.4., Disposal by Burial or Recycling. The BEF has limited storage space for
  RAMs – for disposal and recycling – therefore items may be received by the BEF or held by
  owning organizations until shipped for disposal.        The BEF will work with owning
  organizations on proper storage area(s) at their work sites as needed. Prior to the BEF
  receiving excess radioactive waste from any unit for temporary storage, the IRSO will verify
  the radioactive contents of the containers.
  6.2.2. (OC-ALC) Ensure items are packaged in or on containers such as drums or wooden
  crates/pallets prior to transfer to building 2137. Items packaged in B-25 containers do not
  require a pallet.
     6.2.2.1. (Added-OC-ALC) Coordinate with and follow the guidance of the OC-ALC
     RAM program manager for direction on packaging RAM before transporting to the
     designated staging facility. Shop Supervisors will ensure that a transfer inventory of
     RAM is generated and maintained using OC-ALC Form 122, Radioactive Materials
     Transfer Inventory, Attachment 2.
     6.2.2.2. (Added-OC-ALC) The organization transferring the RAM is responsible for
     delivering to the designated staging facility.
     6.2.2.3. (Added-OC-ALC) Ensure that a detailed inventory (OC-ALC Form 122)
     accompanies all transferred RAM.
     6.2.2.4. (Added-OC-ALC) Components that contain magnesium-thorium (Mg-Th)
     alloys (e.g., gearbox housings, plasma nozzles) must have the weight of each item or
     container annotated on the OC-ALC Form 122.
     6.2.2.5. (Added-OC-ALC) Notify the RAM program manager when quantities are
     approaching a shop’s space limitations and obtain instructions regarding when to deliver
     the material.
  6.2.3. Owning organizations are responsible for all costs associated with the disposal of
  RAM. In most cases this will entail the cost of shipping and may be covered by the AF
  Radioactive Recycling and Disposal Office (AFRRAD).
  6.2.4. Shop Supervisors, Unit RSOs and Permit RSOs will ensure that personnel who use or
  possess RAM or commodities containing RAM are aware of the process for turn-in of excess
  RAM.

  6.2.5. The IRSO will coordinate final shipping or transfer of the excess waste with the unit
  supervisor when disposition or recycling instructions are received from AFRRAD.

As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)— The principle that personnel exposures must
be maintained as low as possible consistent with existing technology, cost and operational
requirements.
Curie (Ci)— The Ci is a unit of radioactivity, defined as: 1 Ci = 3.7×1010 radioactive decays
per second. This is roughly the activity of 1 gram of the radium-226 (226Ra), a substance
studied by the pioneers of radiology, Marie and Pierre Curie (for whom the unit is named).
Typical units of measure in relation to the Curie are the milliCurie (mCi) and microCurie (µCi),
10-3 Ci and 10-6 Ci respectively.
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)— The person that the commander designates, in writing, as the
executive agent for the installation, organization or unit radiation safety program. Same as
―radiation protection officer‖ or ―health physics officer.
TINKERAFBI48-148_OC-ALCSUP_I 9 May 2014                                                       27


IRSO— An individual designated by the Installation Commander (72 ABW/CC) to manage the
base radiation safety program. This individual will usually be a bioenvironmental engineer or
health physicist, if assigned, but may be a Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman (AFSC
4B071). This individual conducts the base-wide radiation safety program which includes
surveillance of all RAMs and RPDs. The IRSO coordinates with and assists the unit, permit or
license and medical facility RSOs as necessary to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated
radiation safety program.
License RSO— See Permit or License RSO.
Medical Facility RSO— An individual designated by the Medical Treatment Facility
Commander (72 MDG/CC) to manage the medical facility’s radiation protection program. This
individual will usually be a health physicist or medical physician who has specialized training
and experience in medical radiation protection programs. In the absence of a health physicist, a
base bioenvironmental engineer may be designated (the same as Unit RSO), provided no nuclear
medicine services exist. In such circumstances, a physician will be identified as the RSO for
nuclear medicine.
Permit or License RSO— An individual designated by the Unit Commander, directorate or
equivalent and approved by the NRC, State of Oklahoma or RIC to manage the radiation
protection aspects associated with the use of RAM or RPDs for which a specific NRC, State or
RIC permit or license has been issued.
Unit RSO— An individual designated by the Unit Commander to act as the single focal point
for the unit on radiation protection matters. A Unit RSO will be appointed for each operational
unit which operates RPDs or uses RAM. The Unit RSO may also be a permit or other RSO. This
individual coordinates radiation surveys or hazard evaluation activities with the IRSO or
permit/license RSO; assists in investigation of suspected or actual overexposures and performs
those radiation protection duties at the unit level which are commensurate with his/her training
and experience. For units that are required to have radiation permits/licenses or have personnel
on the TLD program, a specially designated Unit RSO must be appointed.
Radioisotope— Radioactive isotope is an isotope of an element or atom whose number of
neutrons makes the element radioactive. Radioisotopes may refer in general to materials that
contain radioactive isotopes, i.e. RAM.
Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD)— A TLD is a type of dosimeter, an instrument that
measures the amount of radiation absorbed in a given period. A TLD measures ionizing radiation
exposure by measuring the amount of visible light emitted from a crystal in the detector when the
crystal is heated. The amount of light emitted is dependent upon the radiation exposure.
