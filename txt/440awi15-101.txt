                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. Although an Army Airfield (AAF), the term Pope Field will be used throughout
this publication. Pope Field will be operated under published Air Force Instructions IAW the
Senior Airfield Authority Memorandum of Agreement dated 16 May 2011. The Pope Field
Weather Unit (WU) is assigned to the Airfield Operations Flight (440 OSA) and provides and/or
arranges for weather support to the 440th Airlift Wing, 43rd Airlift Group, 427th Special
Operations Squadron, U.S. Army Company C, 2nd Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, U.S.
Army Parachute Team (Golden Knights) and subordinate units assigned to Pope Field, North
Carolina. The WU is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction establishes
requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime operations and
eliminates the need for written agreements between the WU and supported operations. This
instruction will be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs and be reviewed annually
and updated as required.
1.2. Background.
     1.2.1. According to the CSAF-approved Strategic Plan for AFW Reengineering (8 Aug 97),
     an Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide Resource Protection, Terminal
     Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), Regional and Operational-Level weather products and
     information, Meteorological Watch (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and
     Flight Weather Briefing (FWB) support for Air Force locations within designated geographic
     regions.
     1.2.2. The 26 Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana will
     provide regional and operational-level weather products and information to units in the
     Southeast region of the Continental United States (CONUS).
     1.2.3. Based on the guidance in the Strategic Plan, the WU at each Air Force location will
     focus on providing tactical-level weather products and information needed for mission
     execution and provide weather products and information to the commander of deployed
     forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the OWS and WU are outlined in AFI 15-128,
Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the 26 OWS and
Pope’s WU are defined in the Installation Data Page signed between the 440 OSS/OSAW and 26
OWS and in this instruction. The 26 OWS issues Pope’s TAFs, forecasted weather watches and
weather warnings, and may provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through
Pope Field. The 26 OWS will also issue observed advisories and warnings when the WU is
closed and the airfield is open. The WU will issue all observed advisories and warnings when
open and create tailored Mission Weather Products (MWPs) focused on local missions.
Additionally, the WU will support Pope Field by thoroughly educating agencies on weather
services and products or as directed by the 440 AW/CC.
1.4. Operational Hours and Contact Information.
     1.4.1. Airfield and mission weather services will be provided by 440 OSS/OSAW personnel
     from 0500-2300L Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, and when the 440 AW
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    7


   has their monthly Unit Training Assembly (UTA). During UTA weekends the weather hours
   of operation will vary based on the mission. Hours of operation will be placed in a Notices
   to Airmen (NOTAM) no later than one week prior to the UTA. Staff services, listed in
   Chapter 5, are available during normal duty hours or as required (e.g. Operational Readiness
   Exercises (OREs), Natural Disaster Exercises, etc.). Normally, support for all Joint
   Operational Access Exercises (JOAX) will be provided by the Lead Wing’s WU. The
   Lead Wing’s WU is responsible for coordinating all weather support requirements for
   JOAX IAW AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2. All supported units should coordinate with the
   440 OSS/OSAW and provide at least two week’s notice to request special or additional
   support not addressed in this instruction.
   1.4.2. Pope Field weather personnel are physically located at 393 Surveyor Street, Building
   708, Room 104 between hanger 4 and 5 and can be reached by phone at DSN 424-6543/6544
   or Commercial at 910-394-6543/6544 and Telefax at DSN 424-6548 or Commercial 910-
   394-6548.
   1.4.3. The 26 OWS provides 24/7 weather support to Pope Field and transient aircrews and
   becomes the primary weather support agency when the 440 OSS/OSAW is off duty. The 26
   OWS weather technician can be contacted at DSN 331-2639 or Commercial at 318-529-
   2639.
   1.4.4. During 440 OSS/OSAW non-duty hours, there will be an on-call weather technician
   available in case of the potential for severe weather on Pope Field or
   equipment/communication outages at either Pope Field or the 26 OWS. The 26 OWS, CP,
   ATC, and Airfield Operations will have the telephone numbers of all on-call weather
   technicians.
1.5. Geographic Area of Responsibility (AOR). The area of responsibility for products and
services provided by the Pope Field WU is for the terminal area, which is the area located within
a 5 nautical mile radius around the center of the Pope airfield complex. Pope weather
technicians will Mission Watch (MISSIONWATCH) for all areas and routes in which they
produced MWPs. MWPs will be tailored for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), Visual Flight Rules
(VFR) missions; local parachute jumps; FWBs; Crisis Action Team (CAT)/Air Force Operations
Center (AFOC) briefings; staff briefings; exercise/deployment support; climatology briefings;
and resource protection services for Pope Field. Weather products are tailored specifically to
meet supported unit requirements. For a definition of a MWP, see paragraph 4.5.
1.6. Duty Priorities.
   1.6.1. All WU tasks cannot be accomplished simultaneously. Therefore, duty priorities are
   established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of relative importance and publicized to
   avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty priorities will ensure timely
   response to situations under normal conditions. However, the list will not replace good
   judgment. The weather technician will use Operational Risk Management (ORM) to identify
   risks and determine the best course of action for any given situation. If necessary, additional
   WU personnel will be called to work as a team and respond to duty priorities during periods
   of hazardous/potentially hazardous weather or any other situation affecting operations at
   Pope Field or any of the flying missions. WU personnel may deviate in the best interest of
   flight safety and/or protection of personnel or property.

1.7. Backup Weather Support Procedures.
     1.7.1. The WU has generator backup power but in the event that primary and generator
     power both fail, WU operations will move to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL) as
     outlined in paragraph 1.8. If the AOL is also without power, the 26 OWS will provide
     backup support according to the three tiers of mission support outlined in Table 1.3

Table 1.3. Three-Tier Backup Support Priority Table.
Tier
 1       Products and services supporting wartime, contingency and/or force protection missions
         that must be backed up via immediate transfer to backup organization, including:
         Combined/Joint Operations Area Forecast (C/JOAF); forecast weather watches,
         warnings and advisories, and space warnings; flight weather briefings; military
         operating area forecasts (MOAF); Controlling Mission Weather Products (CMWP);
         flight weather hazards in the combatant command AOR; TAFs; CBRNE hazard
         products (CDMs/EDMs); classified products and services.
    2    Products and services supporting peacetime and/or exercise missions that will be backed
         up to the greatest extent possible after satisfying Tier 1 requirements including CONUS
         JOAFs, flight weather briefings, MOAFs, CMWPs, flight weather hazards, TAFs and
         other products and services.
    3    Products and services supporting peacetime mission planning that will be backed up as
         resources permit after satisfying Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, including long range
         forecasts, space weather, climatology, staff support and other products and services.
     1.7.2. If weather operations at the 26 OWS are interrupted (e.g., power outage, natural
     disaster), the 26 OWS will contact the WU or on-call weather technician and backup will be
     provided according to the three tiers of mission support outlined in Table 1.3 The Pope
 10                                                       440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


   Field TAF and WWAs responsibility will be transferred to the 440 OSS/OSAW until such
   time the 26 OWS is postured to resume operations. Responsibility for other 26 OWS
   products (e.g., graphical products) will be transferred to other agencies as necessary to
   continue weather information flow to Pope’s supported units.
1.8. 440 OSS/OSAW AOL. In the event of a building evacuation, the WU will move to
building 900, room 107A, enroute planning, to continue operational support and “eyes forward”
responsibilities for the 26 OWS. The AOL contact phone number is DSN 424-4959, Comm 910
394-4959.
   1.8.1. Most WU services/support will be provided but will require a case-by-case assessment
   dependent on communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most services to be
   somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss
   of dedicated data services, including sensors and various data types (Meteorological Satellite
   (METSAT), Weather Radar, etc.). Also, the AOL has a limited view of the airfield making
   visibility observations, if needed, difficult to evaluate.
   1.8.2. PMSV services will be discontinued at Pope Field. However, Andrews AFB will be
   contacted to monitor the radio frequency and answer applicable calls since they are on the
   same frequency as Pope Field. The WU will also notify ATC, CP, and Airfield Operations.
   ATC can act as a relay for weather information to airborne aircraft and the CP can initiate
   phone patches to allow forecasters direct contact. For long term evacuations, the WU will
   coordinate with Airfield Operations to publish Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS).
   1.8.3. WU personnel will follow duty specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and
   WU evacuation checklists to resume weather services at the AOL as soon as possible.
   1.8.4. The 26 OWS will assume the following duties until the WU resumes weather services:
       1.8.4.1. Perform METWATCH for Pope Field operations and issue all terminal and
       flying area WWAs to the best of their ability since access to observing sensing equipment
       readouts may be lost.
       1.8.4.2. If the WU is unable to stand up support at the AOL in a timely manner, the WU
       will provide flight information to the 26 OWS and they will assume responsibility for all
       missions departing Pope Field and conduct limited MISSIONWATCH for these and any
       other flights already in the air.
   1.8.5. Once the WU arrives at the AOL, they will stand-up operations as soon as possible
   and notify the 26 OWS, ATC, CP, Airfield Operations, and all of the flying squadrons that
   they have resumed operations at the new site. Wind and pressure values from any form of
   backup equipment will be estimated while at the AOL. The WU will insert the proper
   remark in the observation (e.g., WND DATA ESTMD, ALSTG/SLP ESTMD) in column 13
   of AF Form 3803/3813, Surface Weather Observations (METAR/SPECI).
   1.8.6. All affected agencies will be notified of the subsequent return of the WU to the
   primary work center.
1.9. Release of Weather Information. Weather information will not be released to non-DoD
agencies or the general public without approval from the Pope Field Public Affairs and Legal
offices. Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the Weather Operations
Manager (WOM).
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  11


1.10. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2, Air and Space
Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures – Exploitation, Chapter 2, units that regularly
utilize weather support from Pope’s WU will provide post-mission/utilization feedback, when
possible. This information will be used to ensure proper quality assurance (QA), develop
internal processes to improve product accuracy and forecast proficiency, and to provide a metrics
database.
   1.10.1. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
       1.10.1.1. Web-based feedback located on the Pope Weather Webpage
       https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/21228/SitePages/Weather%20Home.aspx Operations
       Feedback link.
       1.10.1.2. Transient (faxed) and local weather briefing feedback forms (located at the
       forecast counter) will be provided with every briefing.
       1.10.1.3. Email post-mission feedback to 440.OSS.Wx@us.af.mil and/or phone calls to
       the WOM (DSN 424-6553, Comm 910 394-6553).
       1.10.1.4. Routing through the mail system.
       1.10.1.5. Face to face feedback after any completed mission.
   1.10.2. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately reflect the satisfaction with
   and accuracy of the weather support being provided to Pope’s flying units and other agencies
   by the WU.
   1.10.3. The WOM will compile all feedback and establish a monthly summary to determine
   positive and negative trends. This documentation will be used to improve MWPs and
   negative trends will be corrected by assigning additional training.
1.11. Mishap Procedures. When the airfield is advised of an emergency or mishap, the WU
will ensure applicable data used in the development of any weather product and/or service
provided is saved for an investigation (to include 175-1 weather briefing, space weather
products, mission impact slides, etc.). The 26 OWS will save enough data before and after the
mishap to fully reconstruct the environmental conditions. The WU will coordinate with the 26
OWS to initiate a data save for OWS-produced/provided products used in preparing weather
products/services. If the WU used products from other OWSs to support missions crossing
AORs, they must coordinate with all applicable OWSs to initiate a data save. If the OWS
provided weather products/services, they will coordinate the data save with all Air Force
Weather (AFW) units involved. The WU at the departure installation and the mishap location (if
on a military installation) will follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures in AFMAN 15-129
Volume 2, Air and Space Weather Operations – Exploitation, Chapter 3.
1.12. Operational Report (OPREP)-3 Reporting. The 440 OSS/OSAW will provide
information for an OPREP-3 report when the CP requests it for the occurrence of
Significant/Severe Weather, Natural Disasters, Aircraft/Ground Mishap, or CBRNE event. For
these purposes, the following events may require weather information and an OPREP-3:
tornado, surface winds of 50 knots or greater (sustained or gust), hail 3/4 inch or greater,
lightning strikes, snowstorms, Aircraft/Ground Mishap, or CBRNE Event. The CP will then
initiate the OPREP-3 report at the discretion of the Wing Commander. Upon request from the
CP, the WU will provide them with additional data that includes the actual significant or severe
 12                                                      440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


weather experienced, forecast valid at the time of the occurrence to include any watches or
warnings issued (include actual and desired lead time), the operational status of meteorological
equipment (e.g. radar, wind sensors, etc.) at the time of the event, and any other pertinent
information. The CP will forward an OPREP-3 report to higher headquarters as required in
accordance with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. The WU will notify the 26 OWS and
AFRC/A3VA of the OPREP-3 report and the information submitted.
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       13


                                             Chapter 2

                                       AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions that affect Pope Field and aerodrome
(defined within 5 miles of the airfield). Examples include weather observations, Pilot-to-Metro
Service (PMSV), and resource protection. Resource protection will be addressed in Chapter 7.
2.2. Continuous Weather Watch. Pope Field is considered an automated weather station,
meaning the Automated Meteorological Observing System (FMQ-19) performs an automatic
continuous weather watch.
2.3. Basic Weather Watch (BWW): When augmentation (supplementing or back-up) to the
FMQ-19 is required, Pope Field WU personnel will perform a BWW. Due to the additional
duties in the station, weather personnel cannot detect and report all weather changes as they
occur but will use ORM to determine duty priorities. The minimum requirement is to re-check
the weather conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the previous observation. Re-
check to determine the need for a SPECI observation when the following conditions are observed
to be occurring or are forecasted to occur within 1 hour:
   2.3.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   2.3.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   2.3.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles.
   2.3.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles.
   2.3.5. Precipitation (any form).
   2.3.6. Thunderstorms.
   2.3.7. Fog or Mist.
   2.3.8. All supplemental criteria.
   2.3.9. During mandatory back-up of FMQ-19.
   2.3.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will remain
   alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation.
   Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as often
   as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
2.4. Cooperative Weather Watch: Pope Field is an automated weather station and the WU has
established a cooperative weather watch with ATC, and other appropriate base/post agencies, as
required. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility different from the prevailing
surface visibility, local Pilot Reports (PIREP), and any occurrence of previously unreported
weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
local operations and resources. When a reliable source (tower personnel, pilots, etc.) reports a
weather condition different from the last disseminated observation (different visibility) weather
personnel will reevaluate the different weather condition to determine if the FMQ-19 is operating
correctly or needs to be logged out and back-up implemented. The WU will use ORM to
supplement for a weather condition that is beyond the capability of the FMQ-19 to detect (e.g.
 14                                                         440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


fog bank). Certified control tower personnel will alert the WU technician, via hotline, when the
following weather changes occur:
   2.4.1. Tower visibility decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles.
   2.4.2. Tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles and different from the surface prevailing
   visibility.
   2.4.3. A PIREP is received (pass to weather within 5 minutes of receipt).
   2.4.4. Precipitation begins or ends.
   2.4.5. Any indication of convective activity (lightning, rain showers or cumulonimbus
   clouds on the horizon).
   2.4.6. Rapid development, clearing, lowering, or rising of cloud layers.
   2.4.7. Any weather condition that could have an impact on the safe operation of the airfield.
   If the airfield closes, airfield leadership will ensure the runway lights be left on for the FMQ-
   19 RVR sensors to work properly in case the possibility exists for an emergency aircraft
   divert into Pope Field.
2.5. Eyes Forward/METWATCH: METWATCH is a controlled and organized approach for
WU personnel to maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation
within a designated area(s). Pope weather technicians are the eyes forward for 26 OWS weather
technicians and integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection
readouts, and non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers, mesonet data, etc.) to create
an integrated weather picture and near-term trend forecasts. Eyes forward yields meaningful
meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the 26 OWS and is an integral
part of the METWATCH for Pope Field and operating locations. These changes include but are
not limited to incorrect timing, location, or forecast values (e.g., ceiling too high or low). Upon
detecting the change, WU personnel will notify the 26 OWS and begin the process to amend the
forecast product.
   2.5.1. The WU will use ORM to identify potential hazards and evaluate/analyze fine-scale
   and perishable weather products to support the assessment of potential hazardous weather
   conditions. The continuous interaction with the OWS will improve forecast accuracy,
   resource protection, situational awareness, and the mission execution process.
   2.5.2. The WU will use ORM to de-conflict differences of meteorological opinion with the
   26 OWS and determine if a valid hazard/forecast weather condition is agreed upon. If not,
   the weather technician will defer (final determination) to the 26 OWS and document the
   disagreement for the WOM to review.
   2.5.3. Pope weather technicians will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological
   information to the weather technicians conducting forecasting and METWATCH operations
   at the 26 OWS. These include the following:
       2.5.3.1. Weather Observations: The WU will contact the 26 OWS when significant
       deviations in the weather exists from what the FMQ-19 is reporting or if weather
       conditions are rapidly changing. The WU will use ORM to determine if the FMQ-19
       needs to be augmented because of a faulty sensor(s)/communication failure or a weather
       condition is beyond the capability to detect (e.g. fog bank).
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      15


       2.5.3.2. WWAs: The WU will contact the 26 OWS when WWA criteria are occurring or
       forecast to occur and the 26 OWS has yet to issue the WWA. The WU will also contact
       the 26 OWS when criteria are forecast by the 26 OWS and are not expected to occur.
       The WU will use ORM to determine urgency of issuance by either the Pope WU or 26
       OWS.
       2.5.3.3. TAFs/MWPs update: The WU will contact the 26 OWS when local weather
       phenomena are expected that will affect OWS and WU products (e.g., TAFs and MWPs),
       but are not yet forecast. The WU will also contact the 26 OWS when significant forecast
       elements on OWS products are not expected to occur. Communication is the key to
       enable the 26 OWS weather technician to anticipate changes and subsequently adjust
       forecast products.
       2.5.3.4. Other Weather Sources: The WU will pass any significant Pilot Weather Report
       (PIREPs), Airman’s Meteorological Information Report (AIRMET), and Significant
       Meteorological Information (SIGMET) information to the 26 OWS for use in updating
       current weather charts and verification of forecasted conditions. The WU will report
       Unofficial Weather Reports from individuals who are not certified to take official
       observations (e.g. a pilot or law enforcement official) to the 26 OWS. The 26 OWS will
       actively monitor and apply PIREPs, AIRMET, SIGMET, and other perishable data
       sources received from the Pope WU as part of “eyes forward” process.
       2.5.3.5. Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT): When the SWAT is convened, WU
       personnel will intensify monitoring of local and area weather to enhance the
       METWATCH process. WU technicians will pass on significant radar information
       (severe weather signatures) and any other severe weather reports from local sources to
       the 26 OWS. The WU will use ORM to determine resources and personnel required to
       perform this function.
2.6. Surface Observation Site. The official observation for Pope Field NC is taken by the
FMQ-19 and unit sensors are located at each end of the runway. These locations are considered
the official point of observation for automated observations on Pope Field. Runway 23, has the
full suite of Field Data Collection Unit (FDCU) sensors which are located about 150 feet to the
southeast of the runway in the infield grass area. Runway 05, also has FDCU unit sensors
located about 150 feet to the southeast of the runway in the infield grass area. These units sit
about 10 feet off of the ground. The FMQ-19 has no limitations due to its location on the
airfield. The FMQ-19 does have limitations on what it can observe. The FMQ-19 cannot
observe tornadoes, waterspouts, funnel clouds, volcanic ash, snow depth, hail, ice pellets, or
smoke. When augmentation (supplementing or backup) is required to the FMQ-19, the manual
observation point is located approximately 150 feet away from the southwest side of building
708. This puts the observation point on the concrete pavement next to the DV “Red Carpet”.
The field of view from this point is significantly limited due to buildings, hangers, and tree lines.
This does not allow WU technicians to see the entire aerodrome. Specifically, the field of view
is limited to less than 1 mile except south-southwest through west-southwest. High intensity
lights limit the ability to accurately determine nighttime visibility, cloud amounts, and heights.

Figure 2.1. Pope Field Airfield Diagram.




2.7. Surface Weather Observations. The FMQ-19 takes the official observations and operates
in Automated Mode (Auto Mode), meaning the system operates without any WU interaction and
all observations are transmitted automatically. The FMQ-19 will be operated in full automated
mode to provide the official METAR and SPECI observations (described below) except when
being augmented. The FMQ-19 can automatically send/disseminate weather observations
through the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). If required, the weather technician can augment
and disseminate the observation using JET. The latest observations are also available via the
WU Webpage whenever JET is operational. See Attachment 4 for decoding a weather
observation.
   2.7.1. (METAR) Routine Meteorological Observation Report. METAR observations are
   taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. A METAR
   observation could also indicate that special weather criteria were met during the observing
   period. See Attachment 2 for special observing criteria. METAR observations are
   disseminated both locally and worldwide.
   2.7.2. (SPECI) Special Observation. SPECI observations are taken whenever certain
   weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111 and listed in Attachment 2, occur at Pope Field.
   These observations are disseminated both locally and worldwide.
   2.7.3. (LOCAL) Local Observation. A LOCAL is an unscheduled observation reported to
   the nearest minute not meeting SPECI criteria. The only local taken by the Pope WU will be
   for backing up the FMQ-19 pressure sensor. LOCAL altimeter setting observations are taken
   at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3
   hPa) or more since the last reported ALSTG value. A METAR or SPECI taken within the
   established time interval will meet this requirement. All LOCAL altimeter setting reports
   will be prepared and disseminated as soon as possible after the relevant altimeter setting
   change is observed and is only transmitted to Pope Field units.
   2.7.4. All METAR and SPECI observations produced by the FMQ-19 will include
   observation type, date/time, winds, visibility, present weather, sky condition, temperature,
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    17


   dew point, altimeter setting, and remarks. Runway Visual Range (RVR) will automatically
   be included when visibility is one mile or less, and/or the RVR is 6000 ft or less.
   2.7.5. If JET is inoperative, local weather observations will be disseminated by phone to
   ATC, CP, and Airfield Operations.
2.8. Augmentation of the FMQ-19. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified
weather technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited
FMQ-19. The two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up.
   2.8.1. Supplementing is the method of manually providing meteorological information to an
   automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 to detect and/or report
   (e.g. tornado). The WU will also use ORM to supplement for a weather condition that is
   restricting surface visibility and it is beyond the capability of the FMQ-19 to detect (e.g. fog
   bank). WU technicians will supplement the observations and perform a Basic Weather
   Watch when the airfield is open and the weather conditions listed in Table 2.1 are observed
   or forecasted to occur within 1 hour. WU technicians are required to log on to the FMQ-19
   and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic
   activity. WU technicians are not required to supplement during airfield closure hours for any
   other listed criteria.
   2.8.2. Back-up is the method for weather technicians to provide the same reporting
   capability (except for some automated remarks) as that provided by the FMQ-19 when the
   system/sensor(s) is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication
   failure. WU technicians will perform a Basic Weather Watch while backing up. If the
   weather technician determines that a weather condition (e.g. visibility) is significantly
   different than what the FMQ-19 is reporting, the WU technician will evaluate the situation to
   determine if the FMQ-19 is lagging behind the actual observed condition due to rapidly
   changing conditions or if the sensor is not operating correctly. Note: Sometimes in rapidly
   changing conditions, it takes the FMQ-19 time to catch up to the actual weather conditions,
   particularly visibility and ceiling because of the algorithms it uses (e.g. averages 10 minutes
   for visibility and 30 minutes for ceiling). The WU will use ORM to assess any risks. The
   FMQ-19 will be logged out if the sensor(s) is not operating correctly or if there is a
   communication failure.
       2.8.2.1. Weather technicians will ensure supported ATC agencies are notified of all
       outages prior to contacting any maintenance agency.
       2.8.2.2. Weather technicians will make every attempt to immediately log out the FMQ-
       19 except when immediate flight safety (e.g., in-flight emergency) warrants otherwise.

been issued and snowfall is occurring)
Note: The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other phenomena.
   * Note: Hail < 3/4 inch will only be supplemented for when the WU is open. (26 OWS
    hail default values used for hail > 1/4 inch but < 3/4).
Supplementing Remarks. Remarks will be added when supplementing for the above criteria.

1. Tornadic Activity. Tornado(s), waterspouts, or funnel cloud(s) will be reported in a
METAR/SPECI whenever they are observed to begin (first seen), are in progress, or disappear
(end). A SPECI will be generated with the beginning or ending of a tornado, waterspout, or
funnel cloud. The standard contraction +FC for tornado or waterspout is entered into the
PRESENT WX field. In the case of a Funnel Cloud, FC is the contraction used. Tornadic
activity will be encoded as the first remark after the “RMK” entry. Encoded as
“TORNADO_B/E(hh)mm _LOC/DIR(Distance if known)_MOV(If known)” Example:
TORNADO B13 1 SW MOV NE.
NOTE: (hh)mm Only the minutes are required if the hour can be inferred from the report
time.

2. Hail (GR) will be reported in a METAR/SPECI when hail > 1/4 inch begins, is in progress, or
ends. When hail is supplemented into the body of the report, a remark should be included to report
the beginning or ending times. However, normally the SPECI time will be the beginning or ending
time of the hail and no remark is needed. Hail begins at the time it is first observed and ends when it
is no longer falling. No intensity is assigned to hail. Depth of hail on the ground is not reported in
the METAR/SPECI report. The WU technician will report the hailstone size in remarks. Example:
“GR_3/4”

3. Volcanic Ash (VA) will be reported whenever it is observed. VA is always encoded in the
 body of the report regardless of the visibility and no remarks are required. No intensity is
 assigned to volcanic ash.
2.9. Pilot-to-METRO Service (PMSV) Support. Weather information is available via PMSV
on frequency 344.6 MHz. There will be a minimum of one radio check each day to verify the
PMSV radio is in full service. The WU will monitor PMSV traffic during duty hours for aircraft
contacts. For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV or during extended outages, Andrews AFB
will monitor the system. The 26 OWS can provide PMSV support as required through a phone
patch to the CP (DSN 424-9000, Comm 910-394-9000).
    2.9.1. In the event of a PMSV outage, the WU will notify the following agencies:
        2.9.1.1. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS), DSN 424-2505, Comm
        910-394-2505.
        2.9.1.2. Andrews AFB Weather at DSN 858-2840 to monitor the PMSV.
        2.9.1.3. ATC via hotline.
        2.9.1.4. CP via hotline (Can initiate a phone patch as required).
        2.9.1.5. Airfield Operations, DSN 424-6508, Comm 910-394-6508.
        2.9.1.6. 26 OWS, DSN 331-2639.

  2.9.2. For Long Term outage (Over 12 hours):          The Pope WU will contact Airfield
  Operations and have them complete the following:
     2.9.2.1. Local Safety Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). (The decoded message will read:
     “Frequency 344.6 Pilot-to-Metro service not available”.)
     2.9.2.2. NOTAM Example:
NOTAM
CODE: QXXXX 344.6 PMSV
  2.9.3. Brief aircrews of outage. Provide alternate contact options.
  2.9.4. Upon resolution of the outage perform a radio check to verify operability and
  document on PMSV log.
  2.9.5. Notify all affected units when the PMSV equipment is back in operation (ATC, CP,
  etc.).

3.3. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The WU provides mission-tailored weather support
for flying areas used by units assigned or attached to Pope Field. The areas are further defined in
440 AWI 11-250, Local Flying Operating Instructions. Occasionally, the local Ft Bragg ranges
will be used for training. The WU will support these missions by exploiting weather products
produced by the 18 WS.
3.4. 440th Airlift Wing Primary (C-130). C-130 aircraft have specified criteria for take-off
and landing procedures. It is imperative that accurate and timely weather conditions are briefed
(if required) when the following conditions are occurring:

3.9. Critical Weather Factors. The following are critical weather factors that can enhance or
degrade missions, systems, and personnel:
     3.9.1. Low Visibility – Low visibility can impair or stop airborne and ground operations.
     3.9.2. Surface Winds – Strong winds limit surface and airborne operations. Winds in excess
     of 35 knots can cause personal injury, damage material and structures, create false radar
     returns, and reduce visibility. Surface winds affect airborne operations by limiting takeoff
     and landings.
     3.9.3. Precipitation – Precipitation is significant because it affects visibility, personnel
     effectiveness, and a wide variety of military equipment. In addition, both rain and snow can
     drastically reduce personnel effectiveness by limiting visibility, causing discomfort,
     increasing fatigue, and creating other physical and psychological problems.
     3.9.4. Cloud Cover – The type and amount of cloud cover and the altitude of cloud bases and
     tops influence aviation operations. Cloud cover affects ground operations by reducing
     illumination and visibility, or in some instances, by enhancing the effects of artificial light.
     3.9.5. Temperature and Humidity – Together, these elements have a direct impact on
     personnel and vehicle performance. Excessively high temperatures cause heat related
     injuries to personnel and vehicle engine wear that leads to equipment failure. Very low
     temperatures increase cold weather injuries, cause damage to Tanker, Airlift, and Drop Zone
     vehicle cooling systems and engines, decrease the effectiveness of vehicle lubrication, and
     create excessive logistics requirements.
3.10. Airdrops. Wind direction is reported in magnetic degrees and wind speed in knots. The
direction reported is the direction the wind is coming from. Drop zone (DZ) wind information is
critical to airdrop accuracy and safety. It is imperative that accurate and timely wind data be
transmitted to the aircrew. This also includes any unusual observations of wind shear or local

   3.11.1. This section contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations,
   alerts and warnings, and products available to Pope personnel.
   3.11.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
   weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather
   is a lack of sensors. Events can generally be forecast for but, given the speed of solar wind
   and light, our ability to provide lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
   3.11.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Pope’s mission has a wide-variety of
   parameters possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF
   communication, radar, GPS targeting, etc). Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather
   products         (graphics)         are         available        at        this        link:
   https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=space_weather and will be used to
   update the Space Weather portion (Freq/GPS/Rad) of Flight Weather Briefs. GPS Targeting
   Errors will be monitored for specific missions upon request (see paragraph 3.11.4.1). Space
   Weather analysis, alerts, forecasts and warnings are listed at the following link:
   https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page
   Additionally, Space Weather Impacts will be reported through the appropriate link on this
   site.         Bulletins     are     also     available    through      AFW-WEBS           at:
   https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Bulletins A sample
   of the daily discussion is provided in Figure 3.1 See the links above for current Space
   Environment Discussions, including potential impacts to AF/Army Operations.

   3.11.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from AFW-WEBS (see
   links above). Most Space Weather products from the strategic center are “now-casts” and/or
   very short-term forecasts (6-hourly periods), so the duty forecaster will check websites for
   updated products according to the Daily Forecast Checklist and update Flight Weather Briefs
   as needed. For more information concerning these products please use the following AFW-
   WEBS                                                                                   link:
   https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page
   GPS products are primarily “Now-casts” and/or <1 hourly forecast. Duty forecasters will
   monitor                    these                  products.                             See

                                            Chapter 4

                                     MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each supported
unit’s daily mission(s). MWPs are used to accomplish these tasks. MWPs are tailored to
individual supported units requirements and may be anything from a web-based FWB to a
Change-of-Command weather forecast. Any event, both flying and non-flying, that will be
affected by weather normally requires some sort of MWP.
4.2. Operational Hours. Mission Services mirror the Airfield Services operating hours which
are from 0500-2300L Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, and when the 440 AW
has their monthly UTA. If missions dictate, Mission Services may be provided beyond the
normal operating hours with advance notification. Normally, any briefings required between
2300L-0500L and over weekends or holidays will be prepared by the 26 OWS FWB support
section and faxed to the supported unit. Briefings may also be done by the 618 AOC/XOW,
Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) via the Global Decision Support Services (GDSS2).
4.3. Mission Integration/Liaison. The Pope WU will gain an in-depth understanding of
supported mission platforms, equipment, and systems capabilities/sensitivities as well as mission
processes to be able to reliably inject timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information to
optimize mission execution. Supported units mission weather sensitivities will be reviewed and
updated at least yearly.
   4.3.1. To ensure maximum mission support, WU personnel will establish and actively
   maintain relationships with supported units.
   4.3.2. WU personnel will be task organized/aligned to each flying organization on Pope
   Field to act as a liaison to support decision-makers, weapons systems, and missions. They
   will act as a single point of contact for any issues affecting their assigned flying organization.
   This will allow continuity of operations between the WU and flying organizations to be able
   to quickly adapt to process and/or mission changes.
4.4. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). Pope Field TAFs will be produced and
disseminated by the 26 OWS in accordance with AFMAN 15-124, AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-
129, and 440 OSS/OSAW and 26 OWS Installation Data Page. Forecast specification and
amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 3. TAFs are valid for 30 hours, apply to the area
within a 5 NM radius of the Pope airfield complex, and will be issued every 8 hours. The Pope
WU and 26 OWS will collaborate prior to TAF dissemination and formally document the WU’s
inputs. See Attachment 4 for decoding a TAF.
4.5. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). MWPs are essentially mission-specific forecasts
that are developed using a process outlined in AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air and Space
Weather Operations – Exploitation and may be provided by a number of methods (e.g., GDSS2,
verbally, person-to-person, posted on local Webpage, etc). During this process, the WU will
evaluate and tailor products created by the 26 OWS and strategic weather centers, as well as
information supplied by local units (e.g. flying schedule) and agencies and apply to specific
missions by integrating their knowledge of tactics and environmental sensitivities for all aircraft
operating at Pope Field. WU technicians will also integrate their understanding of the current
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    31


aerospace weather situation, perishable data (e.g., observed data, radar, satellite, surface and
upper air observations, pilot reports, mission debriefings, etc.), and their familiarity with local
weather effects. The end result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant
weather intelligence to various supported units by whatever means proves most effective.
MWPs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the
26 OWS. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions
threaten resource protection, the WU will update MWPs as necessary to accurately reflect the
current weather conditions and back-brief the 26 OWS when time permits.
   4.5.1. Flight Weather Briefings (DD 175-1, Verbal). The Pope Field WU will provide
   verbal or traditional DD Form 175-1 to aircrews as requested following the flight’s duty
   priorities listed in Table 1.1 Briefings created by the WU will be conducted at building 708,
   via fax, e-mail, or by phone. All 175-1 flight weather packages/briefings prepared and
   briefed by the Pope WU will be completed IAW AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Attachment 2.
   The Pope WU must have at least 2 hours notice to complete the request. Call DSN 424-
   6543/6544, Comm 910-394-6543/6544.
   4.5.2. The Pope WU is the primary source of tailored weather information for Pope Field
   supported units. When mission activities occur away from Pope Field, the WU will retain
   responsibility (if required) of ensuring our units receive mission execution weather
   information.
       4.5.2.1. When the capability exists, the WU will provide MWPs to Pope Field supported
       units.
       4.5.2.2. If the WU cannot provide MWPs to supported units missions operating from a
       transient or staged location, they will arrange support by any of the following means:
           4.5.2.2.1. Request assistance from the WU at the transient or staged location.
           4.5.2.2.2. If follow-on mission data is not known at execution from Pope Field,
           provide the servicing OWS web site and telephone information to the departing
           aircrew for the OWS servicing the airfield they will be working from.
   4.5.3. 618 AOC/XOW (TACC) MWP Support. The bulk of flying operations at Pope Field
   are supported in a weather capacity by TACC. All AMC and AMC-gained ARC flying
   operations are to obtain all weather services through 618 AOC/XOW (TACC) using GDSS2
   for both Integrated Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM missions.
       4.5.3.1. Aircrews are to request weather packages/briefings via GDSS2 NLT 2 hours
       prior to takeoff. *If a weather package/briefing is requested less than 2 hours prior to
       take off, aircrews are to call TACC at DSN 779-0351/0353, or Comm. 618-229-
       0351/0353 to ensure the mission/sortie is identified in order to complete the weather
       package/briefing.
       4.5.3.2. Aircrews are to update GDSS2 as soon as possible with changes to missions in
       order for TACC to provide an updated weather package/briefing.
       4.5.3.3. Aircrews are to contact TACC if there is a change to the mission/sortie after the
       weather package/briefing has been posted or published, and/or the need for weather
       updates during mission execution.
     32                                                       440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


            4.5.3.4. Any new package/briefing or an update to an existing package/briefing is to be
            accomplished by TACC.
            4.5.3.5. Use of the Pope WU for TACC controlled missions. The Pope WU will shadow
            weather packages in GDSS2 and backup TACC in the event of a communication failure
            or high operational tempo by TACC. If TACC is unable to provide a weather
            package/briefing and/or update, aircrews may request a weather package/briefing and/or
            update from the Pope WU provided workload and duty priority allow for supporting this
            task and the Pope WU is open.
               4.5.3.5.1. Aircrews may obtain updated take-off weather from the Pope WU as
               needed. The Pope WU will notify TACC DSN 779-0351/0353, or Comm. 618-229-
               0351/0353 if the takeoff update includes any of the weather criteria listed below.

    Table 4.1. Weather Criteria Requiring Notification to TACC.
Ceiling/visibility < to 200ft/1/2SM
Dry runway crosswind 25kts or greater
Wet runway crosswind 20kts or greater
Forecast LLWS for KC-10 operations
Observed LLWS for all AMC aircraft
Predominant thunderstorms on station
Freezing precipitation
Moderate (or greater severity) turbulence/icing
Forecast or observed volcanic ash on takeoff

               4.5.3.5.2. The Pope WU will subscribe to and monitor Weather Threat Assessment
               (WTA) notifications for locally assigned missions. This will allow the WU to
               provide updates to aircrews via PMSV, phone-patch etc. when requested. NOTE:
               Coordinate with TACC if weather deviates from the published WTA.
               4.5.3.5.3. The Pope WU will consult/coordinate with TACC, as required, to resolve
               any aircrew concerns/issues and facilitate discussions between aircrew members and
               TACC to elaborate on weather impact and/or answer aircrew questions. The TACC
               is the final arbiter for weather issues involving IFM and non-IFM sorties/missions.
        4.5.4. Transient Aircraft/Aircrews MWP Support. Transient aircrews can receive FWBs
        from GDSS2, home base WU, Pope WU, or the 26 OWS. Transient aircraft/aircrews are to
        first utilize either GDSS2 or their home base WU for flight weather packages/briefings
        and/or updates. In the event transient aircraft/aircrews cannot access GDSS2 or their home
        base WU is unable to provide a flight weather package/briefing and/or update, aircrews may
        request a flight weather package/briefing and/or update from the Pope WU provided
        workload and duty priority allow for supporting this task, and the WU is open.
        4.5.5. 26 OWS MWP Support. In the event the Pope WU is unable to provide a flight
        weather package/briefing and/or update due to workload, duty tasks or being closed, aircrews
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 33


   are to contact the 26 OWS FWB Support section through the 26 OWS flight brief scheduling
   system, accessible through the 26 OWS web site: https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/, or by
   calling the weather briefer at DSN: 331-2651 or Comm.318-529-2651, FAX: DSN 331-2609.
   Aircrews are encouraged to request the flight weather package/briefing at least 2-hours prior
   to brief time. Aircrews can either have the 26 OWS email or fax the flight weather
   package/briefing to them.

   4.5.9. Tropical Cyclone (Hurricanes, Tropical Storms) MWPs.
      4.5.9.1. Once a tropical system develops in the Atlantic Basin, Gulf of Mexico, or
      Caribbean Sea, the Pope WU will be responsible for tracking updates posted by the NHC
      via the Hurricane Tracking (HURRTRAK) program and leveraging 26 OWS products.
      The Pope WU will fully utilize and not deviate from the tropical cyclone information
      provided by the 26 OWS.
      4.5.9.2. During duty hours, WU personnel will ensure that tropical system updates are
      sent by e-mail to key personnel on Pope Field.
      4.5.9.3. The 26 OWS will produce a coordinated Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment
      Product (TC-TAP) for Pope Field when sustained winds are expected to be ≥ 35 knots
      during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone. The 26 OWS will provide site-
      specific TC-TAP information as requested by the Pope WU.
          4.5.9.3.1. The TC-TAP will contain, at a minimum, the following:
             4.5.9.3.1.1. Time and date product was produced and the NHC bulletin
             number/identifier used to create the product.
             4.5.9.3.1.2. Onset and duration of sustained 35-knot and 50-knot winds.
             4.5.9.3.1.3. Peak wind and time of occurrence, including gusts.
             4.5.9.3.1.4. Onset and duration of operationally significant crosswinds (35
             Knots).
    36                                                        440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


                 4.5.9.3.1.5. Closest point of approach of the storm relative to the installation.
                 4.5.9.3.1.6. Forecast cone product.
             4.5.9.3.2. The TC-TAP will be valid through a minimum of 96 hours and updated as
             new information is received from the NHC.
          4.5.9.4. Briefings. WU personnel will give recommendations for Hurricane Evacuations
          (HUREVAC)/Hurricane Condition (HURCON) status and briefings as required by the
          CAT/AFOC. The CAT/AFOC will normally be activated 72 hours before the forecast
          arrival of sustained winds 30 knots or greater. The official forecast on all tropical
          systems will be verbatim with the bulletins published by the 26 OWS and NHC. WU
          personnel will not deviate from the official forecast position, track, movement, and
          maximum wind speed or intensity trend. The HURRTRAK program depicting the NHC
          forecast track will be used as the primary briefing tool. These products will provide the
          foundation for WU forecast products (winds, hurricane direction, etc.). However, inputs
          from the Pope WU may provide additional guidance to senior leadership based on their
          experience and training. Refer to the 440 AW Pope Field HUREVAC Plan for further
          guidance.
      4.5.10. Special Event MWPs (Air Show etc.). The Pope Field WU will provide additional
      weather support for special events as required. Briefings will be produced and tailored based
      on the type of support.
      4.5.11. Regional weather data via the Pope WU web                            site located at
      https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/21228/SitePages/Weather%20Home.aspx               may     provide
      additional information.
   4.6. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial
   weather or the space environment for specific mission-limiting (e.g., ground, air, or space)
   environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH process identifies and alerts decision makers to
   changes affecting mission success. The WU will use ORM and assign risk, allocate resources,
   and direct activities as required.
      4.6.1. The WU will categorize missions in their MISSIONWATCH Log with potential high
      risk weather hazards as SOME RISK (Yellow) and AT RISK (Red) and continuously
      monitor these missions for significant changes to weather information by evaluating fine-
      scale perishable products. The WU will spot-check low risk missions. These are indicated
      as NO RISK (Green).
      4.6.2. The WU will focus on mission-limiting weather thresholds for each specific mission.
      If there are any significant changes to the forecast based on parameters listed in Table 3.5,
      Mission Critical Weather Related Impacts/Actions or Table 4.2, MISSIONWATCH Log
      Criteria, the WU will contact the appropriate agencies listed in paragraph 4.6.6.

   Table 4.2. MISSIONWATCH Log Criteria.

                                          Chapter 7

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

7.1. General. This section contains details on weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
(WWAs), Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP), and other significant events where
weather may be a factor. Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the
26 OWS and the Pope WU. The 26 OWS is responsible for disseminating/issuing all forecasted
weather watches and warnings. The WU acts as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS, and is
responsible for disseminating/ issuing all observed warnings and advisories during the hours the
WU is open. However, the WU can disseminate/issue any forecasted warning if there is an
immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, the WU will be responsible for
dissemination to local supported agencies and will back-brief the 26 OWS when time permits.
Conversely, the WU will act as the alternate dissemination/issuing source for the 26 OWS. The
goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to Pope Field.
7.2. Forecast Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to supported units
indicating that conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather
phenomena (e.g. tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches should be issued at a minimum of one hour
before a warning is issued, with the exception of the lightning watch, which should be issued at
least 30 minutes before the lightning warning is issued. Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of
the center-point of the Pope Field runway complex when the potential for the criteria listed in
Table 7.1 exists.

issued for Pope Field. The WU will issue observed weather warnings for Pope Field when
lightning is occurring within 5 NM or 10 NM of the airfield. Lightning warnings are not issued
until lightning is observed either, visually by the FMQ-19, or on AFW-WEBS using Vaisala’s
Global Lightning Dataset 360. The WU will provide timely notification to all supported units
upon issuance and expiration of a lightning warning via JET. Observed warnings are issued
when the criteria listed in Table 7.3 is occurring.

 Lightning observed within 10 NM of the airfield
 Note: If the WU is closed the 26 OWS will issue all observed weather warnings. Cancel
 warnings for OBSERVED LIGHTNING when thunderstorms have dissipated or passed beyond
 the area covered by the warning and lightning is no longer occurring within 5 NM or 10 NM of
 the airfield. For lightning warning cancellations, include a statement indicating its affect on any
 previously issued warnings, such as "WEATHER WARNING #XX-XXX remains in effect" or
 ―WEATHER WATCH #XX-XXX FOR LIGHTNING REMAINS IN EFFECT.

7.5. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather advisory is a special notice sent to
supported units alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact
operations, is occurring on Pope Field. The WU will issue observed advisories for a 5 NM
radius of the center-point of the runway complex. All advisories for Pope Field are observed;
there are no forecasted weather advisories for Pope Field. Observed advisories are issued when
the criteria listed in Table 7.4 is occurring.

 Low Level Wind Shear
 Note: If the WU is closed the 26 OWS will issue all observed weather advisories.


7.6. WWAs numbering and text. WWAs are identified numerically by month and by
sequential number of the watch, warning, and/or advisory issued. For example, a warning
number of "09-002" indicates the month of September (09), and the warning is the 2nd (002) one
issued in September. The text of a warning, watch, or advisory will be worded so that all
recipients may easily understand it. See Attachment 4 for examples of different messages.
7.7. Documentation.
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   47


   7.7.1. All WWAs issued by the 26 OWS or WU will be kept via JET.
   7.7.2. Only one warning will be in effect at any given time (and will include multiple
   warning criteria as required) except for Tornado warnings and/or Observed Lightning
   warnings. Included, will be maximum hail size, maximum rain/snow accumulation, or
   maximum wind speed as applicable in warnings and advisories.
   7.7.3. Watches are stand alone products based upon potential and are unaffected by warnings
   or advisories for the same phenomena.
   7.7.4. All observed weather advisories and warnings are valid until further notice (UFN).
   7.7.5. Weather watches and warnings may be extended provided the extension is issued prior
   to the expiration of the original notice.
   7.7.6. A warning is upgraded by adding a phenomena or crossing to a higher threshold. A
   warning is downgraded by removing a phenomena or crossing to a lower threshold.
   7.7.7. It will be clearly state how the amended or extended weather watch or warning affects
   any previously issued notice.
   7.7.8. Forecast weather warnings and advisories will maintain horizontal consistency with
   the TAF and other forecast products. Watches are not required to be included in the body of
   the TAF-coded forecast depending on circumstance.
   7.7.9. If necessary, the Pope WOM will request a formal forecast review from the 26 OWS
   for severe weather events that negatively influence the effective execution of military
   operations. The 26 OWS will be the primary OPR for the formal review, and the WU will
   provide inputs and coordination as required.
7.8. The Pope WU will:
   7.8.1. Contact the 26 OWS when a weather warning is occurring or likely to occur and the
   26 OWS has not issued the corresponding warning.
   7.8.2. Notify the 26 OWS when weather warning phenomenon has ended.
   7.8.3. Use ORM to issue or supersede weather warnings when threatening weather
   conditions that could impact the mission and/or resources are imminent and a forecast
   weather warning has not been issued (or if issued, is not representative). The Pope WU will
   be responsible for local dissemination.
   7.8.4. Inform the 26 OWS as soon as possible after-the-fact when the WU has issued or
   superseded a weather warning.              Once notified, the 26 OWS can assume
   responsibility/accountability for the warning.
   7.8.5. Cancel all weather warnings (if required) or observed advisories when conditions are
   no longer expected to occur.
7.9. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP ensures processes are in place
and sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. The Pope WU will use the ORM
process to identify the potential for severe weather and evaluate/analyze fine-scale perishable
weather products to support the assessment of severe weather conditions. These procedures
 48                                                       440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


document a two-tier system with the Pope WU and the 26 OWS sharing responsibilities for the
SWAP and resource protection.
   7.9.1. The SWAP will be initiated when the threat of severe weather and conditions
   requiring notification listed in Table 7.5 exists. The SWAP will be under the direction of the
   WOM or designate and remain established until the threat of severe weather passes.

Table 7.5. Conditions Requiring Notification to Implement SWAP.

   d. Any Winter Related Advisory/Watch                                        When Issued


4. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as a communications line failure, a critical
   equipment outage at either the 26 OWS or the WU, the WU will implement the SWAP at the
   26 OWS’s request. The 26 OWS, as the agency ultimately responsible for forecast
   watch/warning support, will have this prerogative in the interest of Pope Field resource
   protection and flight safety.


5. Severe Thunderstorms are identified upstream within 100 NM of Pope Field


6. Any other event or situation that the on-duty weather technician (26 OWS or Pope WU)
deems notification is necessary


   7.9.2. Notification. The Pope WU technician will notify the WOM or designate or the 26
   OWS weather technician will notify the on-call Pope WU technician according to the
   following guidance:
       7.9.2.1. During normal staff duty hours (0500 – 2300L), Monday through Friday, except
       federal holidays, or during the 440 AW UTA days, the Pope WU technician will
       implement the SWAP by notifying the WOM or designate either in person or by phone
       whenever one or more conditions listed in Table 7.5 are met. Together they will use the
       ORM process to assess/analyze the risk and determine risk control decisions. If the
 50                                                      440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


      SWAT is activated on direction from the WOM or designate the responsibilities/duties
      listed in Table 7.6 will be executed.
      7.9.2.2. On-Call Procedures. During nights, weekends, and federal holidays the 26 OWS
      weather technician will implement the SWAP by notifying the on-call Pope WU
      technician by home phone/cell phone whenever one or more conditions listed in Table
      7.5 are met to determine if the SWAT is to be activated.
         7.9.2.2.1. The 26 OWS will discuss the meteorological situation with the on-call
         Pope WU technician. The Pope WU technician will use ORM to de-conflict
         differences of meteorological opinion with the 26 OWS and determine if a valid
         severe weather condition is agreed upon. If not agreed upon, the Pope WU
         technician will defer (final determination) to the 26 OWS and document the
         disagreement for the WOM to review.
         7.9.2.2.2. If time permits, the on-call Pope WU technician will then call the WOM or
         designate and discuss the meteorological situation. Together they will use the ORM
         process to assess/analyze the risk and determine risk control decisions (i.e., recall to
         the weather station, more personnel needed for support etc.). If the WOM cannot be
         contacted or if time is a factor, report to the weather station immediately.
         7.9.2.2.3. Upon arrival to the weather station, the on-call Pope WU technician will
         evaluate the situation using the ORM process, determine the need to recall the WOM
         or designate or more personnel, and begin to execute the SWAT
         duties/responsibilities in Table 7.6
      7.9.2.3. If the potential for severe weather exists within the next 12 hours but is NOT
      occurring or imminent, the on-duty Pope WU technician will contact the WOM to advise
      him of the situation. Together, they will use the ORM process to evaluate and assess the
      severe weather risk.

     7.9.3. Unless the occurrence of severe weather was unexpected, the Pope WU technician
     (either on-duty or on-call) will be notified as soon as possible before the expected occurrence
     of severe weather. A forecast discussion will then be conducted with the 26 OWS.
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   53


   7.9.4. The Pope WU, 26 OWS, and Simmons WU (if on duty) will work as a team during
   severe weather events and conduct forecast discussions when necessary. The Pope WU
   technician will serve as the “eyes forward” for the OWS and pass severe weather reports
   from local sources (e.g. National Weather Service, local news media and off-duty personnel)
   to the 26 OWS.
   7.9.5. When discussing and using AFWA products and OWS-issued watches and warnings,

   modify and/or supplement OWS-issued weather watches or warnings.
   7.9.6. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather occurs the Pope WU will accomplish the
   following:
       7.9.6.1. Pass any severe weather reports that are not normally available through standard
       observations to the 26 OWS Flight leadership. Examples include reports from local law
       enforcement and emergency management agencies, and local news media. Reports will
       be passed immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement so the 26 OWS
       can use the reports during post analysis and verification.
       7.9.6.2. Ensure the 26 OWS SWAT leader performed a “weather data save” and
       provided all pertinent information to the WOM. The WOM will compile the information
       and provide a summary to the 26 OWS/DO and 26 OWS/CC for further dissemination at
       their discretion.
       7.9.6.3. Provide weather information to Pope Field Command Post in accordance with
       local SOPs. If the 26 OWS was acting as the Pope WU, coordinate with them on events
       reported to the Pope Field Command Post.
   7.9.7. The Pope WU will conduct severe weather exercises at least annually.
7.10. Tropical Weather. Pope Field is located in a hurricane threat zone. Hurricane season
lasts from June through November. However, hurricanes have occurred at other times
throughout the year. Pope doesn’t have to worry about storm surge, but other serious threats that
can occur with the hurricane are tornados, extreme wind gusts, and flash flooding. These natural
phenomena cause extensive damage and degrade the mission of all supported missions on Pope
Field.
   7.10.1. Once a tropical system develops in the Atlantic Basin, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean
   Sea, the Pope WU will be responsible for tracking updates posted by the NHC via the
   HURRTRAK program and leveraging 26 OWS products (TC-TAP).
   7.10.2. The official forecast on all tropical systems will be verbatim with the bulletins
   published by the NHC. WU personnel will not deviate from the official forecast position,
   track, movement, and maximum wind speed or intensity trend. The WU is authorized to
   tailor the official tropical cyclone forecasts into a specific mission forecast product for the
   Pope Field supported units. Tailoring may include factors such as specific local effects such
   as terrain or relative position to the storm.
   7.10.3. The 26 OWS will perform METWATCH and serve as liaison between the NHC and
   WU.
 54                                                         440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012


    7.10.4. The 26 OWS will use the wind forecasts from the tropical cyclone bulletins and
    tailor the forecasts for terrain effects for issuance in TAFs and WWAs.
    7.10.5. The WU will translate the official tropical cyclone forecast and 26 OWS forecasts
    into a specific mission forecast for Pope supported units. All briefing products provided to
    supported units will contain the statement that “48-hour and 72-hour outlooks (or longer)
    contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are subject to
    change”. It will also include the forecast error probability statements included in discussion
    bulletins or other forecast products.
    7.10.6. Hurricane/tropical storm advisories are issued to alert agencies of potential for
    sustained winds of 50 knots or greater (HURCON) and potential for sustained winds of 30
    knots or greater. The conditions/phases give sufficient preparation time to safeguard
    personnel, aircraft, equipment, and facilities.
    7.10.7. Winds of 64 knots or higher are classified as hurricane force winds. However, all
    planning actions will be based on forecast winds of 30 knots or greater. The wing’s decision
    to evacuate should be made early (approximately 24 hours prior to 30 knot winds
    arriving) to avoid aircraft take-off wind limitations and departure delays due to saturation of
    air traffic routes and control facilities and wind limitations.

                                        winds

    7.10.8. During duty hours, WU personnel will ensure tropical system updates are sent by e-
    mail to 440 AW and 43 AG key personnel.
    7.10.9. WU personnel will give recommendations for HURCON status and briefings as
    required by the CAT/AFOC. The CAT/AFOC will normally be activated 72 hours before the
    forecast arrival of sustained winds 30 knots or greater.
    7.10.10. WU technicians will aid the 26 OWS to support any flying operations and forecasts
    for Hurricane Evacuation. If the 26 OWS cannot conduct operations, the Pope WU will take
    over issuing TAFs and weather watches/warnings. In addition to TAFs and watch/warning
    criteria, the following information will need to be forecast:
       7.10.10.1. Onset and duration of 35 knot crosswinds impacting C-130 operations.
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                               55


        7.10.10.2. Onset and duration of 30 knot sustained winds.
        7.10.10.3. Onset and duration of 50 knot sustained winds.
        7.10.10.4. Time and range of storm center at closest point of approach
   7.10.11. Weather information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public
   without approval from the 440 AW Public Affairs and Legal offices.
7.11. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDMs). Pope WU personnel will use the 26 OWS
generated CDM on their webpage if available.

7.12. CBRNE Support. The Pope WU will:
     7.12.1. Get familiar with the CBRNE plume models utilized by the EM team (e.g., Joint
     Effects Model (JEM), Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), Computer-
     Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO), Mapping Application for
     Response, Planning, Local Operational Task (MARPLOT)), their tactical decision aid
     outputs, and uses in the commanders’ decision cycles.
     7.12.2. Understand the variety of possible weather input options within each model for each
     type of C, B, R, N and E event.
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  57


   7.12.3. Recommend and provide the most appropriate weather data type for the EM team to
   use to run their chosen CBRNE model to assess a real-time event which has occurred at a
   specific location and time.
   7.12.4. Help in determining the optimal weather data type for the chosen CBRNE model.
   7.12.5. In most cases, transport models can be configured to automatically pull observed or
   forecast gridded model. The WU will provide a region-specific model data recommendation
   consistent with the CU model (WRF). Historical climatological data should not be
   recommended except for training or long-term planning where canned scenarios are being
   used.
   7.12.6. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, make sure that
   observations and forecasts provided are representative of the location/time of the CBRNE
   event.
   7.12.7. Work closely with the EM team to ensure the commander gets a consistent picture.
7.13. Bioenvironmental Information. The 440th Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight
measures and determines the actual Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index. Heat
categories (Category 1 through 5) are ranges of the WBGT Index. The Pope WU has a link on
their web page for a breakdown of the heat category and recommended actions. There is also a
link to the Wind Chill Index.

                                           Chapter 8

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

8.1. General. TAFs, weather observations, and WWAs are useful only if supported units have
access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of weather information is crucial to the
success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most organizations will receive this
information via our primary dissemination system (JET). Some organizations will receive
courtesy calls, however, AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, restricts the WU
from directly notifying (via telephone) more than 3 organizations in order to focus on incoming
weather phenomena. This section describes the weather dissemination systems, dissemination
procedures, and back-up systems and procedures.
8.2. Dissemination Systems and Back-ups.
   8.2.1. Currently the WU uses JET as its primary method of disseminating TAFs, weather
   observations, and WWAs. Other agencies requiring direct access to JET have been given a
   login and password. Agencies without JET access will receive critical weather information
   through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g. Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit Control
   Center, etc). The WU will follow documented backup dissemination procedures documented
   in the SOPs in the event that JET is inoperative.
   8.2.2. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for disseminating
   GDSS2 briefings (if required). Additionally, it is used as the backup system for
   disseminating and receiving all weather information. In the event of a LAN outage and the
   WU is providing GDSS2 briefing support, they will contact TACC to complete the briefings.
   8.2.3. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between the WU and other agencies for the
   sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the
   event of a hotline outage.
       8.2.3.1. Command Post (4-9000)
       8.2.3.2. Tower (4-1672/1866)
       8.2.3.3. Airfield Management (4-6508)
8.3. Dissemination and Back-Up Procedures.
   8.3.1. TAFs. TAFs will be entered and disseminated through JET as described in Chapter 4.
   If the JET is out of service then the WU will disseminate the information locally via standard
   telephone lines to the CP and tower.
   8.3.2. Weather Observations. Observations will be taken and disseminated through the JET
   as described in Chapter 2. When the JET is out of service, observations will be disseminated
   worldwide through the AFW-WEBS. If all long-line transmission resources are out of
   service, call via telephone (voice relay) to the 26 OWS or any other weather station for
   worldwide transmission. Locally, observations will be relayed by the WU to the following
   organizations (noted on a local dissemination log), in order of priority when the JET is out of
   service:
       8.3.2.1. Tower (Hotline/4-1672/1866)
440AWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2012                                                              59


       8.3.2.2. Airfield Management Operations (same building as the WU/4-6508)
       8.3.2.3. Command Post (4-9000)
Note: Other base organizations can view weather observations through the WU webpage.
   8.3.3. WWAs. WWAs will be disseminated via JET. The WU will contact the 26 OWS
   when observed warnings and advisories are issued. If the JET is out of service, the 26 OWS
   and/or WU will contact the same organizations listed above in order of priority (via phone
   line). Further dissemination by Airfield Management and the CP is as follows:
       8.3.3.1. Airfield Management. Airfield Management relays all WWAs via the secondary
       crash phone. (landlines are used for backup purposes):
       8.3.3.2. Pope Field Combined CP. The CP disseminates all WWAs by telephone and
       Giant Voice.
       8.3.3.3. Tornado Warnings. The WU will immediately contact the CP via phone if a
       Tornado Warning is issued. The CP has the primary responsibility for activating Giant
       Voice/Sounding the Siren.
       8.3.3.4. Lightning Warnings. Lightning warnings are also disseminated via JET. All
       lightning warnings are disseminated to the base populace by the CP via the Giant Voice
       system allowing all members on Pope Field to be prepared.

   A4.2.11. Lowest altimeter group (QNH). Lowest altimeter setting expected during each
   forecast group (Initial, BECMG, FM groups – not TEMPO groups).
   A4.2.12. TEMPO change group. This code means that the conditions listed on that line may
   occur for periods of less than 30 minutes (+15 minutes for thunderstorms) anytime between
   the time frame following the TEMPO code (28/1200Z to 28/1500Z in the above example).
   A4.2.13. BECMG change group. This is a code to indicate that a change to the predominant
   conditions will be followed by a description of all elements for which the change is forecast.
   The forecast conditions encoded after the BECMG group are those elements expected to
   prevail from the ending time of this change group to the next BECMG group or ending time
   of the forecast period. The conditions will change during the time period that follows the
   BECMG code (28/1500Z to 28/1600Z in the above example).

                     ATC COOPERATIVE WEATHER WATCH MOA

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
BETWEEN: 440 OSS/OSAW and 440/OSAT
SUBJECT: Cooperative Weather Watch
1. IAW AFMAN 15-111, Weather Units (WU) responsible for preparing surface weather
observations, without regard to the mode of operation, will establish a cooperative weather watch
with Air Traffic Control (ATC). Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility different
from the prevailing surface visibility, local Pilot Reports (PIREP), and any occurrence of
previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety
or efficiency of other local operations and resources.
2. The 440 WU will task certify new tower personnel to evaluate and take limited visibility
observations. Tower controllers will use the following process to become certified:
a. Study Air Training Guide 60, (Tower Visibility Guide), dated 31 Jan 10 and reference Air
Force Manual 15-111, (Surface Weather Observations), dated 27 Feb 13 to gain the knowledge
necessary to complete the tower visibility examination.
b. Watch a power point slide presentation on some weather observing challenges unique to
Pope Field and on disseminating PIREPS to the WU.
c. After completing the items above, visit the WU to receive an orientation and take the tower
visibility examination.
d. Log completion of task certification on AF IMT 3622.
3. When tower personnel observe a visibility condition less than 4 miles and is significantly
different from the last disseminated observation weather personnel will reevaluate the visibility
to determine if the FMQ-19 is operating correctly or needs to be logged out and back-up
implemented. If the WU is closed and tower personnel see a significant difference between what
is being reported by the FMQ-19 and is affecting current operations, call the on-call weather
technician to discuss the situation. (Note: Sometimes during rapidly changing ceiling and
visibility conditions it takes time for the sensors to catch up with actual observed
conditions.)
4. The WU will use Operational Risk Management to supplement for a weather condition that
is restricting surface visibility and it is beyond the capability of the FMQ-19 to detect (i.e. fog
bank).
5. Weather technicians will do the following when backing-up or supplementing the FMQ-19
for visibility:
a. Notify the tower, as soon as possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at the official weather
observation point decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles.
b. Re-evaluate the surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon initial receipt of a
differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable changes at the control
tower.
c. Use control tower values of prevailing visibility as a guide in determining the surface
visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings, aircraft, etc.

6. Certified control tower personnel will alert the weather technician, via hotline, when the
following weather changes occur:
a. Tower visibility decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles.
b. Tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles and different from the surface prevailing visibility.
c. A PIREP is received (pass to weather within 5 minutes of receipt).
d. Precipitation begins or ends.
e. Any indication of convective activity (lightning, rain showers or cumulonimbus clouds on the
horizon.)
f. Rapid development, clearing, lowering, or rising of cloud layers.
g. Any weather condition that could have an impact on the safe operation of the airfield.
7. If the airfield closes, airfield leadership will ensure the runway lights be left on for the RVR
sensors to work properly in case the possibility exists for an emergency aircraft divert into Pope
Field.
