(HILL) This supplement implements AFPD 36-21, Utilization and Classification of Air Force Military
Personnel. The purpose of the Logistics Career Broadening Program (LCBP) is to develop officers expe-
rienced in the management of the Air Force wholesale logistics process as implemented at an Air Logis-
tics Center. These officers will fill key wholesale logistics assignments within the Air Force and the DoD.
This instruction establishes the LCBP at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC). All OO-ALC Wings
and/or Major Staff Offices will support the program. This program supports the HQ USAF/IL-sponsored
program managed by Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) per AFI 36-2111. See Attachment 1 of this
supplement, for a glossary of references and supporting information. Maintain and dispose of records in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and the AFRIMS Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It reflects a modified title
and new, expanded, and revised guidance on responsibilities, procedures, eligible participants, and opera-
tions.
(HILL) Hill AFB Instruction 36-2111 is reformatted from its stand alone format to conform with supple-
ment formatting under AFI 36-2111; all references to Phase II rotations, the 3-year program, Officer Per-
formance Reports (OPR), and home directorates were deleted, since the current AFI changed the program
from a 3-year program to a 2-year program. The change resulted in deleting the second phase of the pro-
gram and turning LCBP officers into students, eliminating the OPR requirement and requiring training
reports (TR). All office and organization references are updated to reflect the current OO-ALC reorgani-
zation structure; the Program Guidance Committee (PGC) composition was modified per OO-ALC Vice
Commander (OO-ALC/CV) from all two letter directorates under the old organizational structure to just
the five wing commanders/directors, LCBP Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) senior functional managers
and 75th Mission Support Group Commander (75 MSG/CC); the Working Capital Fund rotation has been
eliminated and the three remaining rotations among Depot Maintenance, Program Management, and Sup-
ply Chain Management have been set at 8 months each, per flexibility allocated within AFI 36-2111;
OO-ALC/CV has levied end-of-rotation and beginning-of-rotation requirements among the LCBP offic-
ers, as well as the gaining and losing supervisors and wing commanders, including: Documented rotation
work plans, mid-term feedback, end-of-tour report, end-of-tour Letter of Evaluation (LOE), and
end-of-tour brief; assigned all LCBP officers functionally OO-ALC/DP or Unit Working within; and
training requirements for LCBP officers are no longer documented in the Hill AFB Supplement. Instead,

the appointed LCBP Action Officer is required to distribute AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard
Continuation/Command JQS, training documents, which outline training objectives for the officers.

Agency (DLA) positions, only 21RX and 64PX AFSCs are eligible to participate.
    1.1. The intent of the LCBP is to broaden and expose selected officers to the wholesale logistics
    (depot/DLA) experience. Officers competitively selected for this program gain valuable knowledge
    and experience in managing the acquisition and sustainment aspects of the Air Force Logistics System
    through rotational assignments in various functional areas of an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or DLA
    Inventory Control Point (ICP). All students are required to obtain Level I certification in Life Cycle
    Logistics while in the program, but obtaining Level II certification is desirable. While LCBP members
    will not have priority for the courses requiring Level II certification, every effort should be made to
    attend on a space available basis. Requirement for Level II certification is 2 years of experience and
    additional courses, as defined by the Defense Acquisition University.

Section B—Phases

2. The program consists of three phases.
    2.1. Phase I - Orientation. This phase consists of in processing; initial acquisition training; and an Air
    Force Materiel Command introductory conference. This phase begins 1 August and ends 31 August.
    2.2. Phase II – Rotations. This is a 20-month long, work-and-learn phase emphasizing professional
    growth and active participation. Throughout this phase, Career Broadening Officers will continue to
    complete Logistics and Acquisition Courses from AFIT and DAU, professional development semi-
    nars, and tours. This phase consists of two six-month rotations and one eight-month rotation, defined
    as Phase IIA, Phase IIB, and Phase IIC. From the ALCs, LCBP participants will obtain experience in
    the Supply Chain Management, Depot Maintenance, and Program Management Mission Areas. Each
    Career Broadening Officer will complete one rotation in each of these three mission areas, in any
    sequence. Regarding the Supply Chain Management and Program Management Mission Areas, one of
    those rotations should be accomplished within a “commodity” area and the other rotation should be in
    a “weapon system” area. Generally, 21XX officers will be assigned to their specified eight-month
    rotation in Program Management and 6XXX officers will complete their eight-month rotation in
    Depot Maintenance. The first rotation through the three Mission Areas begins after completion of
    Phase I. From DLA Inventory Control Point, LCBP participants will obtain experience in Demand/
    Supply Planning, Acquisition, Weapon System Support, Contingency Planning and Supply Chain
    Management using a similar approach as the ALCs.
    2.3. Phase III - Two Options. With the approval of the Air Logistics Center or ICP Vice Commander
    (ALC/CV), or DLA AF National Account Manager (NAM) officers may elect one of two options for
    the remaining three-months of the program: extension of Phase II rotations to compensate for training,
    leave, or other out of rotation time or the addition of an abbreviated rotation in another Air Logistics
    Center or ICP area.
AFI36-2111_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                     7


   2.4. (Added-HILL) Phase I time will be combined with each officer’s Phase IIA rotation. In addi-
   tion, the remaining time in Phase III will be spread among the Phase IIA and Phase IIB rotations so
   that all three Phase II rotations will be 8 months. This will give each LCBP officer three equal rota-
   tions in Supply Chain Management, Depot Maintenance, and Program Management, giving them
   overall perspective of wholesale logistics and understanding of the relationships between logistics
   functions.

Section C—Post-Training Assignment

3. Upon completion of the program, Career Broadening Officers will be assigned to positions in their pri-
mary career field or to career broadening positions that focus on continued Officer Professional Develop-
ment (OPD). Post training assignments will be received through the normal assignment process, with the
involvement of the ALC/CV or DLA AF NAM, ALC Functional Manager, applicable Force Develop-
ment Team, and applicable Assignment Team.

Section D—Eligibility Criteria

4. Captains in the 21XX, 61S, 62E, 63AX, 64PX, and 65FX career fields, have several opportunities to

bership will consist of HQ AFMC/LG, HQ USAF/ILGF, SAF/AQXD, MAJCOM/DR/FM/LG/PK (1 rep
from each MAJCOM), OC-ALC/CV, OO-ALC/CV, WR-ALC/CV, DLA AF NAM or their designated
O-6/GS-15 or above designated representatives. The board will select the 21/24 (alternating years, for a
total of 15 at an ALC or ICP) most highly qualified officers, regardless of AFSC, and assign 7/8 selectees
to each ALC and 2 to an ICP. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential
vacancies.

Section G—Pre-Arrival Procedures

7. All Career Broadening Officers will report to their respective ALC MSS as required by the AF/IL
release message. The arrival window announced in the release message will be adhered to and will be
used for the purpose of partial in-processing, house hunting, leave, and household goods receipt. All offic-
ers will be expected to begin Phase I on the announced date.

Section H—Training Reports

8. Officers selected for this program are considered Management Level Training Students, and in accor-
dance with AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and will receive AF Forms 475, Edu-
cation/Training Report. Career Broadening Officers receive letters of evaluation (LOEs) after each
rotation. This requirement is to ensure that the senior rater for the organization to which the Career Broad-
ening Officer is assigned has at least some visibility of the duties performed by that officer during his/her
rotation. Education/Training Reports will be accomplished annually resulting in one at the conclusion of
the first year and a final Education/Training Report issued at the completion of the program. The ALC
Vice Commander (ALC/CV) or DLA AF NAM will endorse both.
    8.1. Duty title for LCBP participants for all reporting will be: “HQ USAF Logistics Career Broaden-
    ing Officer.”
    8.2. Include the following introductory statement in each participant’s Education/Training Report:
    - Competitively selected member of a HQ USAF logistics executive-development program
    - Program develops future senior leaders through specialized duty rotations in an Air Logistics
    Center or DLA Inventory Control Point
    - Focused on weapon system sustainment, modernization, maintenance and combat operations
    support
    8.3. (Added-HILL) In preparing LCBP officer’s end-of-rotation evaluation, directors/commanders
    will use AF IMT 77, Letter of Evaluation, and document the officer’s accomplishments and perfor-
    mance during their rotation in that area.

   8.4. (Added-HILL) ALC unit mission description will be utilized for all LCBP officer Promotion
   Recommendation Forms (PRF). Additionally, the following standardized duty description will be
   used as an introduction in all PRFs: “Competitively selected member of a HQ USAF logistics execu-
   tive-development program. This highly select program of 21 officers develops future senior leaders
   through specialized duty rotations within an Air Logistics Center, focusing on weapon system sustain-
   ment and modernization, depot-level maintenance and combat operations support.”

Section I—Awards and Decorations

9. Career Broadening Officers will not be nominated for, nor receive, any individual tour completion or
meritorious service awards for this training program. This is consistent with Air Force policy for officers
in a training status. Exceptions to this policy include unit awards and citations, providing the Career
Broadening Officer’s rotation occurs within the specified time frame. Career Broadening Officer’s may
also be awarded individual decorations for specific acts of heroism or significant accomplishment. No
exceptions to this policy will be granted as the LCBP is a formal training course and Air Force members
are not authorized award of an individual or tour completion decoration while attending formal courses.

Section J—Program Completion

10. Career Broadening Officers incur a three-year ADSC upon completion of the program as described in
AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). Career Broadening Officers complete the pro-
gram one of three ways: successful completion of all training requirements; self-elimination from the pro-
gram; or removal from the program for the good of the Air Force. Officers who self-eliminate from the
program or are removed from the program for the good of the Air Force will return to their core AFSC
career field.

Section K—Accrual of Time in Core AFSC and for APDP Certification

11. LCBP participants will continue to accrue time in their core AFSC/functional area and for APDP Cer-
tification throughout the duration of the program. HQ USAF/ILG through SAF/AQ will ensure partici-
pants are waivered to accrue experience time in their core AFSC and to accrue experience time for APDP
Certification throughout the duration of the program. Additionally, HQ USAF/ILG will ensure officers
earn applicable SEI(s) for their primary career field.

     19.1. Act as the mentor for LCBP officers assigned to the directorate or ICP.
     19.2. Conduct a monthly mentoring session with each LCBP officer assigned to the directorate or
     ICP.
     19.3. Ensure completion of applicable training tasks and document in training forms.
     19.4. Participate in the ALC PGC (not applicable to DLA).
     19.5. (Added-HILL) The OO-ALC Wing Directors/Commanders and unit directors have a major
     input to the program content for each participant rotating into their unit. The key objective is to assign
     meaningful work that allows the LCBP officer to make contributions to the mission, to gain useful
     knowledge within the unit, and gain exposure in the areas designated before program completion.
     19.6. (Added-HILL) Directors/Commanders will support the LCBP objectives by establishing and
     conducting a wing program, which meets the guidelines put forth in this instruction.
     19.7. (Added-HILL) Ensure meaningful work experiences in support of mission requirements are
     assigned to LCBP officers. They will ensure these taskings support the AF IMT 797 training require-
     ments for the LCBP officers. Additionally, they will support Acquisitions Professional Development
     training, core training, and Professional Military Education training of the LCBP officers to the fullest
     extent of their unit’s ability.
     19.8. (Added-HILL) If applicable, be an active member of the OO-ALC LCBP PGC.

     over a career broadening officer will lay out a formal training plan for the officer’s rotation, and doc-
     ument it in Memorandum for Record (MFR) format. The MFR will include identifying the LCBP
     officer’s training requirements and obligations (formal training, TDYs, etc), outlining the supervisor’s
     expectations and unit goals, and providing a general plan of action to meet the training requirements,
     expectations, and unit goals. This MFR will require both the supervisor’s signature and the LCBP
     Officer’s signature and should be briefed or presented to the owning Wing Director/Commander for
     his/her signature at the first monthly, mandatory mentoring session per AFI 36-2111. The Lead
     Career Broadening Officer will be responsible for ensuring the MFRs are then collected and delivered
     to the Vice Center Commander for review. The functional supervisor will also conduct a mid-term
     feedback (approximately 4 months into the rotation). This mid-term feedback is strictly between the
     LCBP officer and supervisor, and will be used to measure how far the officer has progressed with both
     training and meeting the supervisor’s expectations and unit goals.
