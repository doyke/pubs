     6.1.1. AHS will be the call-in point for all UND “A” priority issues. Upon call-in,
     property movement/delivery will be coordinated with the requesting activity. If property
     is available in warehouse and the customer cannot pick it up, AHS personnel will retrieve
     from the applicable storage facility, move it to the DC holding area, and notify the FSC
     (1) to have it delivered to the customer.
        6.1.1.1. If property is available in a bench stock or supply point account, the owning
        activity will be notified and a turn-in, and issue, processed as necessary. If the

     will check Discoverer Script Stock Number Directory, or appropriate listing(s) to
     determine asset availability. If Stock Number Directory and/or listing(s) reflect an on-
     hand balance, a physical on-hand balance check will be conducted. If the balance is
     correct, the customer will provide a post-post document to AHS personnel who will pull
     the property, move it to the DC holding area, and notify personnel to have it delivered to
     the customer. AHS personnel will retain the post-post document, AF Form 2005, Issue

     document (TEX 8) and a post-post issue document. If the property is available in a supply
     point account, the AHS section will notify the owning activity to pull the asset, prepare a
     credit turn-in document (TEX 8), and prepare a post-post MSI. AHS personnel will
     contact the FSC (1) to coordinate with DC for the retrieval/pick up of the property, and
     delivery to the appropriate activity. When the computer returns in-line, the initiator will
     process documents using proper post-post procedures, per reference in paragraph 6.1.2.
     6.1.4. If the property is not available, MICAP status will be verified by Aircraft
     Maintenance Unit (AMU) supply personnel utilizing the MICAP checklist until all
     avenues to locate an available asset locally are exhausted. For all other than AMU back
     shops which normally do not sustain 24/7 operations, AHS personnel will verify
     requirements as MICAP and use the checklist to initiate MICAP actions.
     6.1.5. When the ES-S computer is off-line and assets marked “MICAP-999” are received
     after hours, AHS Receiving personnel will verify the receipt as MICAP, obtain necessary
     information to prepare a post-post Due-Out Release document, and arrange for property
     movement/delivery.
     6.1.6. When the ES-S computer returns in-line, AHS personnel will process the post-post
     receipt with the due-out document number in positions 60-73, annotating the stop time,

       person.
       6.3.3. The HAZMAT standby member will verify the customer’s authorization in AF-

       will contact the Bio-Environmental standby point of contact. HAZMAT handler will
       process the issue request only if Bio-Environmental approves it. If approved, the
       HAZMAT handler will override the reject by assigning a document number and
       processing the request. The name of the approving authority in Bio-Environmental will
       be annotated on the reverse side of the AF Form 2005 and will be kept on file in
       HAZMAT element.

       documented in the events log. Details concerning repairs must be specific
       (names/dates/times/location/registration number, etc).
