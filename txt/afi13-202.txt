                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Search and Rescue (SAR).
   1.1.1. SAR is a lifesaving service provided through the combined efforts of the federal
   agencies signatory to the National SAR Plan, and the agencies responsible for SAR within
   each state. The U.S. Coast Guard, DOD components, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the Coast
   Guard Auxiliary, state, county and local law enforcement and other public safety agencies,
   and private volunteer organizations provide operational resources. Services include search
   for missing aircraft, survival aid, rescue, and emergency medical help for the occupants after
   an accident site is located.
   1.1.2. National Search and Rescue Plan. By federal interagency agreement, the National
   Search and Rescue Plan provides for the effective use of all available facilities in all types of
   SAR missions. These facilities include aircraft, vessels, pararescue and ground rescue teams,
   and emergency radio fixing.
       1.1.2.1. Under the plan, the U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the coordination of SAR
       in the Maritime Region, and the USAF is responsible in the Inland Region. To carry out
       these responsibilities, the Coast Guard and the Air Force have established Rescue
       Coordination Centers (RCCs) to direct SAR activities within their regions.
       1.1.2.2. For aircraft emergencies, distress, and urgency, information normally will be
       passed to the appropriate RCC through an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or
       Flight Service Station (FSS).
1.2. SAR agencies and responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) is located under the 1 st AF
   (AFNORTH) at Tyndall Air Force Base, FL. As the United States' executive agent for inland
   search and rescue, it serves as the single agency responsible for coordinating on-land federal
   SAR activities in the 48 contiguous United States, Mexico and Canada.
       1.2.1.1. The AFRCC operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The center has extensive
       telephone capabilities including a direct tie-in to the Federal Aviation Administration
       (FAA)'s alerting system and the United States Mission Control Center (USMCC).
       1.2.1.2. In addition to the Cosmicheskaya Sistema Poiska Avariynyh Sudov
       (COSPAS)/Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) information, the
       AFRCC computer system contains vast resource files that list federal and state
       organizations, which can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout North America.
       1.2.1.3. When notified that an aircraft is overdue and the Preliminary Communication
       Search (PRECOM) has not been successful, the RCC will:
          1.2.1.3.1. In the Continental United States (CONUS), and Alaska, verify that FAA
          has initiated an Extended Communication (EXCOM) search.
          1.2.1.3.2. In other areas, initiate the EXCOM.
4                                                                     AFI13-202 11 March 2010


           1.2.1.3.3. If the EXCOM is unsuccessful, classify the aircraft as missing and notify
           the commander of the base of departure. If the aircraft did not depart from an Air
           Force base, request the installation commander nearest the point of departure assume
           the duties usually performed by the Commander of the base of departure.
           1.2.1.3.4. Take search and action.
           1.2.1.3.5. Make verbal or radio search progress reports (as often as practicable) to the
           commander of the base of departure. Include the commander of the base of departure
           as an addressee on all search mission reports (including progress, closing, or
           suspending reports) sent to higher headquarters.
    1.2.2. The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD and serves as the U.S. operational component
    of a multi-agency, multi-national program using COSPAS/SARSAT to detect and accurately
    position emergency signals from airplanes and ships in distress.
    1.2.3. CAP provides SAR mission coordinators, search aircraft, ground teams, personnel on
    alert status, and an extensive communications network. The CAP is the AFRCC’s primary
    air and ground resource in the inland area, especially for extended searches.
    1.2.4. FAA through the ARTCC and FSS facilities , monitor and flight follow aircraft in the
    inland area. In addition, FAA facilities initiate EXCOM actions outlined in FAAO JO
    7110.10, Flight Services and this AFI.
       1.2.4.1. FSS serve as the central point for collecting and disseminating information on
       overdue or missing aircraft that are not on an Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flight plan.
       1.2.4.2. ARTCC serve as the central points for collecting information, coordinating with
       SAR, and conducting a communications search by distributing any necessary Alert
       Notice (ALNOT)s concerning:
           1.2.4.2.1. Overdue or missing IFR aircraft.
           1.2.4.2.2. Aircraft in an emergency situation occurring in their respective areas.
           1.2.4.2.3. Aircraft on a combined Visual Flight Rule (VFR)/IFR or an air filed IFR
           flight plan, and 30 minutes have passed since the pilot requested IFR clearance, and
           neither communications nor radar contact can be established.
           1.2.4.2.4. Overdue or missing aircraft, which have been authorized to operate in
           accordance with a Special VFR (SVFR) clearance.
    1.2.5. MAJCOMs are responsible for OCONUS regions and must publish region or theater-
    specific overdue aircraft procedures. National regulations or agreements adopted for USAF
    use in overseas areas take precedence over this instruction; however, every effort should be
    made to conform to this instruction. Refer conflicting procedures to higher headquarters for
    review and direction. Include host nation procedures, adopted for USAF use, in MAJCOM
    supplements or equivalent.
    1.2.6. Installation Commander.
       1.2.6.1. At Air Force bases with an operational runway and auxiliary airfields (as
       applicable), ensure procedures are developed to take appropriate SAR actions.
AFI13-202 11 March 2010                                                                          5

      Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation and this AFI for overdue aircraft.
      1.2.6.3. When notified that an aircraft is classified as missing, the departure base
      installation commander will:
          1.2.6.3.1. Notify the Chief of Staff, Headquarters US Air Force and the Director of
          Flight Safety, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico through the National Military Command
          Center (NMCC). Include the names, grades, and service numbers of crew and
          passengers; type of aircraft; aircraft number; home base of aircraft; home base of
          pilot; place of departure; time of departure; intended destination; route; mission;
          estimated time enroute; position when last reported; weather enroute; and any other
          pertinent information.
          1.2.6.3.2. Notify, by the most expeditious means of communications, the commander
          of each person in the aircraft and home base of the aircraft. Keep these commanders
          informed of the search progress.
   1.2.7. In the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories the
   departure base (military or civil airfield) is responsible for SAR action until receipt of the
   destination base acknowledgment for the flight notification message. This responsibility is
   then transferred to the destination base.
      1.2.7.1. In the case of a U.S. registered aircraft, or any aircraft known to be piloted by or
      transporting U.S. citizens and enroute within a foreign country or between two foreign

                              OVERDUE AIRCRAFT ACTIONS

2.1. Overdue Aircraft.
   2.1.1. An aircraft on a flight plan is considered overdue when it has failed to arrive at its
   destination, compulsory reporting point, clearance void time or clearance limit within 30
   minutes of the estimated time of arrival.
   2.1.2. An aircraft not on a flight plan is overdue at the actual time a reliable source reports it
   to be at least 1 hour late at destination.
      2.1.2.1. Based on this overdue time, apply the same procedures and action times as for
      aircraft on a flight plan.
      2.1.2.2. When such a report is received, verify (if possible) that the aircraft actually
      departed and that the request is for a missing aircraft rather than a person.
      2.1.2.3. Refer missing person reports to the appropriate authorities.
2.2. PRECOM Search Actions.
   2.2.1. Destination Base. The agency responsible for flight following aircraft at the
   destination base (normally the host Airfield Management) will:
      2.2.1.1. Contact local air traffic control facilities and ARTCC sectors through the area
      manager. Note: This action frequently resolves questions regarding IFR aircraft.
      2.2.1.2. Notify the destination tie-in FSS if the responsible agency is in CONUS or
      Alaska; in other areas the RCC.
      2.2.1.3. Initiate a ramp check.
      2.2.1.4. Check adjacent airports that could accommodate the aircraft.

   2.3.3. If the replies to the INREQ are negative, or if the aircraft is not located within 1 hour
   after transmission of the INREQ, or upon fuel exhaustion time, whichever occurs first, the
   destination base shall:
      2.3.3.1. Transmit an ALNOT to the appropriate Regional Operations Center and those
      facilities within the search area. In addition, address the RCC using the collective
      address KSARYCYX. Note: The search area is normally that area extending 50 miles
      on either side of the proposed route of flight from the last reported position to the
      destination. The search area may be expanded to the maximum range of the aircraft at
      the request of the RCC or by the destination base.
      2.3.3.2. If the departure base, route of flight, destination base, or alternate airports are
      within 50 miles of the Great Lakes, include Cleveland AFSS as an addressee. They will
      relay to the Cleveland RCC. Include all information in the ALNOT message that will
      assist in search activities (same as INREQ plus any additional information received).

Alert Notice—A request originated by the destination base, flight service station (FSS) or an air
route traffic control center (ARTCC) for an extensive communication search for overdue,
unreported, or missing aircraft.
Air Route Traffic Control Center—A facility established to provide air traffic control service
to aircraft operating on IFR flight plans within controlled airspace and principally during the en
route phase of flight. When equipment capabilities and controller workload permit, certain
advisory/assistance services may be provided to VFR aircraft.
Flight Service Station—An air traffic facility which provides pilot briefings, flight plan
processing, en route radio communications, search and rescue services, and assistance to lost
aircraft and aircraft in emergency situations. FSSs also relay ATC clearances, process Notices to
Airmen, broadcast aviation weather and aeronautical information, and notify Customs and
Border Protection of transborder flights. In addition, at selected locations, FSSs provide En
Route Flight Advisory Service (Flight Watch) and Airport Advisory Service (AAS). In Alaska,
designated FSSs also provide TWEB recordings and take weather observations.
Information Request—A request originated by the destination base for information concerning
an overdue aircraft.
