SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates recommendations as well as several other required changes to include
administrative and clerical. Specifically, changes include an increase in the micro-purchase
threshold to $3,000 for authorized supplies and equipment. Purchase of services, where the
Service Contract Act applies remains at $2,500. The increase in the micro-purchase limit for
goods applies to the use of Convenience Checks. Convenience check use is unallowable for
recurring services. Purchasing of office supplies must be ordered on-line with participants
maximizing established service/agency agreements until 30 Sep 2011. Effective 1 October 2011,
in accordance with mandatory Office Supply II BPAs AF Ordering Guide, all office supplies
must be purchased online from Air Force-wide buying arrangements or your local AbilityOne
store. Critical Green Procurement requirements are incorporated in accordance with Executive
Order 13423 with a mandate for training for all GPC participants. All checks written, regardless
of the dollar amount, must be reported in the TD Form 1099 MISC, Statement for Recipients of
Miscellaneous Income, system. The A/OPC will include the 1099 reporting process and
procedures in their initial training. In addition, approving officials and A/OPCs surveillance
results must include verification of your 1099 reported data and validation of critical green
procurement requirements. Using the GPC to purchase supplies for contractors is not normally
allowable and the determination of allowability rests with the Contracting Officer and must be
determined In Accordance With (IAW) the terms and conditions of the contract. Authorized use
of GPC over the micro-purchase threshold against a pre-priced contract with restricted
competition is authorized with less than three (3) sources only if approval is given by a
warranted Contracting Officer. Timeframe to dispute a transaction has increased to 90 days from
the transaction posting date. CONS 237, Simplified Acquisition Procedures training requirement
has been mandated for primary and alternate Agency/Organization Program Coordinators
(A/OPC). Third-party payments are allowable when no other option is available. Government
contractor employees cannot perform independent receipt of goods or services received. Due to
enhancement of program oversight, the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) is mandated
for GPC participants AF-wide https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web/. Per DoD mandate
Refresher Training is now every two years. Also, establishment of a mandated minimum
standards have been identified for each approving official and cardholder file. In addition,
A/OPCs are to perform surveillance of each approving official account. Informational quarterly
briefings to installation commander shall include accounts that have been suspended due to
approving official’s failure to reconcile within 60 days after close of the billing cycle. A/OPCs
must deliver all rebate/credit checks to the FMA within five days of their receipt.

                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Introduction. The Government-wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program is intended to
streamline small purchase methods by minimizing paperwork, streamlining the payment process,
and simplifying the administrative effort normally associated with traditional purchase methods
for supplies and services. The main goal is to provide Air Force users a simplified, streamlined
method of purchasing and paying for simple, low-dollar value, items of supply and service.
1.2. History. Executive Order 12352 on Federal Procurement Reforms set forth requirements
for Federal agencies to establish programs for reducing administrative costs and other burdens
that the acquisition functions may impose on the Federal Government and the private sector.
The Purchase Card was adopted to replace the paper-based, time-consuming purchase order
process; thereby, eliminating procurement lead-time, providing transaction cost savings,
reducing procurement office workload, and facilitating payment. Purchase cards are used by
cardholders to pay for authorized government purchases, subject to an established transaction
amount, billing cycle amount, and merchant code limitations.
The General Services Administration (GSA) has awarded a multiple-award schedule contract for
Government Commercial Purchase Card (GPC) services. The contractor (hereinafter referred to
as ―the Bank‖) provides purchase cards and associated services to enable federal employees to
make official purchases. The purchase card is an internationally accepted VISA credit card that
can be used to make micro-purchases. A purchase card charge authorizes the Bank to make
immediate payment to the vendor or contractor.

The Department of Defense (DoD) GPC program is managed by the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) through its Purchase Card
Program Management Office (PCPMO). The PCPMO establishes annual training and
documentation requirements for cardholders and other officials and oversees the purchase card
program. (See their website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ for policy letters, guidebook, and
other pertinent documents.)

The Air Force GPC Level 2 program coordinator is located in the Office of the Deputy Secretary
of the Air Force for Acquisition Contracting (SAF/AQC). For Air Force specific policy and
instruction, see the AF Contracting Central section of the SAF/AQC Homepage on the Air Force
(AF) Portal at https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/pages/default.aspx.
1.3. Waivers. Requests to waive part or all of this instruction must be approved by SAF/AQC.
Waiver requests must be submitted in writing to the Major Command (MAJCOM) Contracting
Division for review and concurrence. SAF/AQC will not process waiver requests without
MAJCOM Contracting Division concurrence.
1.4. Purchase Card Uses. The primary use of the purchase card is to purchase supplies and
services for official government business valued at or below the micro-purchase threshold. The
purchase card may also be used as a method of payment in conjunction with other contracting
methods above the micro-purchase threshold depending on the type of contracting vehicle
utilized, with the appropriate delegation of authority.

     1.4.1. Appropriated Funds. This instruction applies to all Air Force GPC purchases using
     appropriated funds. Non-Air Force tenant organizations that are issued GPCs or convenience
     checks by an Air Force contracting office are also subject to the requirements of this AFI.
     1.4.2. Non-Appropriated Funds. This instruction does not apply to GPC purchases using
     non-appropriated funds. See Air Force Non-Appropriated Funds Government Purchase Card
     Program governing regulation.
     1.4.3. The Air National Guard is subject to this instruction only in regard to payment issues.
1.5. Purchase Card Benefits. The primary benefits of purchase card usage are to reduce
administrative paperwork, streamlines the certification and payment process, enables vendor
payment within 72 hours by Electronic Funds Transfer through a commercial bank, eliminates or
minimizes prompt payment interest through the use of the online certification and payment
system, and provides rebates to the Air Force based on the dollar volume of use and timeliness of
payment.
1.6. Program Structure. The GPC Program is based on a six-level reporting hierarchy.
     1.6.1. Level 1. The first level of the reporting hierarchy is DoD as a whole. The DoD
     PCPMO serves as the Level 1 reporting agency.
     1.6.2. Level 2. The second reporting level identifies the military service. SAF/AQC serves as
     the Level 2 reporting agency for the Air Force. The Deputy Assistant Secretary
     (Contracting), Assistant Secretary (Acquisition) shall appoint a SAF/AQC staff member to be
     the Level 2 focal point for the Air Force. The Level 2 focal point serves as a liaison between
     Air Force organizations and the PCPMO, the Bank, and GSA, communicates DoD and Air
     Force policy to the field, and provides overall program support.
     1.6.3. Level 3. The third reporting level identifies the MAJCOM/Agency.         Each
     MAJCOM/Agency shall appoint one primary and one alternate Level 3 focal point. These
     individuals are responsible for the implementation and administration of the
     MAJCOM/Agency GPC program subject to the DoD and Air Force policies. The Level 2
     focal point serves as the liaison between the MAJCOM/Agency field organizations and
     SAF/AQC and the Bank, and provides overall MAJCOM/Agency program support.
     1.6.4. Level 4. The fourth reporting level identifies the specific installation/organization
     under each MAJCOM/Agency. The Contracting Squadron Commander (CONS/CC),
     director or equivalent shall appoint one primary and at least one alternate Level 4 focal point.
     The Level 4 focal point is referred to as the Agency/Organization Program Coordinator
     (A/OPC), and is responsible for program implementation and administration, training, and
     monitoring at the installation level. The A/OPC serves as the liaison between the installation
     organizations and the MAJCOM, the Bank, and Financial Management Analyst (FMA).
     1.6.5. Level 5. The fifth reporting level identifies the particular organization authorized to
     use the GPC. Each organization’s commander or director shall appoint a primary and
     alternate Approving Official (AO) to serve as the Level 5 agent. Primary responsibilities
     include GPC administration for the organization, including approval/disapproval of all
     purchases subsequent to reconciliation by the cardholder, funds accountability, and
     surveillance of all cardholders within the AO’s account.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    7


   1.6.6. Level 6. The sixth reporting level identifies the individual cardholder (CH). Primary
   responsibilities include making authorized transactions, logging and reconciling transactions,
   and approval of all valid transactions made in support of organizational requirements.
1.7. Field Communication. A/OPCs shall direct all questions or issues to their MAJCOM
Level 3 focal point. If necessary, specific policy issues shall be forwarded from the MAJCOM to
SAF/AQC
1.8. Purchase Card On-line System (PCOLS). PCOLS is an electronic system that GPC
participants will use to improve the management and accountability of their GPC program as
well as allow both auditors and commanders to assess the relative health of local purchase card
programs. PCOLS is comprised of four web-enabled automated tools; Enterprise Monitoring and
Management of Accounts (EMMA), Authorizations, Issuance and Maintenance (AIM)
applications, Data Mining (DM), and Risk Assessment (RA). The Air Force shall use PCOLS as
an electronic tool for managing its GPC program.

                  PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES AND MANAGEMENT

2.1. Air Force Level. SAF/AQC shall appoint an Air Force GPC Level 2 focal point. Primary
Level 2 responsibilities are described in paragraph 1.6.2.
2.2. MAJCOM/Agency Level. Each MAJCOM/Agency shall appoint a Level 3 focal point.
Primary Level 3 responsibilities are described in paragraph 1.6.3. Level 3 focal points should
also ensure that mandatory A/OPC training is completed.
2.3. Installation Level
     2.3.1. Installation Commander. Each installation commander, director or equivalent shall
     have overall responsibility for the operation of the GPC program for their installation. The
     commander is ultimately responsible for establishing effective internal controls that will
     ensure the appropriate management, operation, and oversight of the local GPC program. The
     commander should establish and maintain a command climate to prevent requiring or
     requesting personnel from exercising undue influence over the actions of a cardholder. The
     commander shall establish local policies and procedures identifying informal and formal
     disciplinary actions to be taken in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse and/or abuse.
     Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity and frequency of the infraction, and can
     range from informal actions such as written or verbal counseling, to demotion, removal or
     potential criminal prosecution.
     2.3.2. Contracting Squadron Commander (CONS/CC) or Equivalent.
        2.3.2.1. The CONS/CC shall designate one primary and at least one alternate
        Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) to be the Level 4 focal point to
        manage the installation GPC program.
        2.3.2.2. CONS/CC shall issue written authority to cardholders not located in contracting
        organizations to make purchases or place orders. This function may not be delegated,
        except to the Deputy CC in the absence of the CONS/CC. Warranted contracting officers
        do not require a separate delegation of authority to use the GPC. A sample delegation of
        authority letter is available at Attachment 4. The following thresholds for single
        purchase limits apply:
            2.3.2.2.1. Personnel not assigned to a contracting office shall be delegated authority
            to use the GPC to make single purchases for products only up to the micro-purchase
            threshold, which is $3,000 for goods, $2,500 for services where Service Contract Act
            applies, and $2,000 for construction, except as authorized in 4.1.6
            2.3.2.2.2. Personnel not assigned to a contracting office will be limited to not more
            than $25,000 per transaction in ordering items or services from pre-priced contracts
            and agreements.
        2.3.2.3. The CONS/CC shall brief the installation commander, director or equivalent at
        least quarterly on the GPC program. This briefing should include a summary of
        violations, and either corrective actions taken for each instance or a justification why no
        action was considered necessary. The briefing shall also cover the numbers of accounts
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    9


     suspended due to failure to reconcile within 60 days after the close of the billing cycle;
     instances of suspected fraud, waste, and/or abuse, surveillance results (see paragraph
     5.1.1.2), convenience check violations, preferred vendor/vendor discount programs, and
     overall installation trends.
     2.3.2.4. The CONS/CC or equivalent shall develop Internal Management Controls to
     operate, manage and provide oversight of the local program. At a minimum, the
     following controls shall be put in place to maintain the integrity of the program.
        2.3.2.4.1. Separation of Duties. Ensure that the roles and responsibilities of the
        individuals within the GPC program are not in conflict and adequate checks and
        balances are in place to manage local programs. The restrictions to personnel
        designated as cardholders also apply to convenience check writers.
            2.3.2.4.1.1. Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC).               A/OPCs
            should not be Approving Officials (AO) or purchase cardholders.
            2.3.2.4.1.2. Approving Officials (AO). Individuals designated as approving
            officials should not be assigned as purchase cardholders. If manpower
            considerations require an AO to be a purchase cardholder, under no circumstances
            shall any purchase cardholder be his/her own approving official. In addition, AOs
            should be, to the greatest extent possible, the supervisor of the cardholder or be in
            the direct line of authority of their purchase cardholder.
            2.3.2.4.1.3. Purchase Cardholder. Purchase cardholders shall not be subjected to
            undue influence over their actions as a cardholder by A/OPCs, AOs, or others
            within the command.
            2.3.2.4.1.4. Financial Management Personnel. Neither Resource Managers nor

            the responsibility of executing their own funds.
            2.3.2.4.1.5. Resource Advisors (RA). RAs can be AOs provided they have not
            been given authority or designated to perform certifying duties. The decision may
            be based upon the lack of adequate personnel resources within an organization.
            Certifying Officers are defined as individuals responsible for certifying that
            payment vouchers are correct and proper for payment.
        2.3.2.4.2. Separation of Function. In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
        process there must be, at a minimum, a two-way separation of functions for all
        purchase card transactions. This is defined as one person making the purchase with
        the purchase card and a separate person receiving, inspecting and accepting the
        purchase.
            2.3.2.4.2.1. In cases where the cardholder is picking up the material at the
            vendor’s location, the end user or other designated receiving personnel shall
            legibly print their name and title, then sign and date the receipt confirming
            independent receipt and acceptance of the material or services.
            2.3.2.4.2.2. In the event the purchase cardholder is the end user, he/she may sign
            the vendor receipt. However, the purchase cardholder shall ensure another
            Government employee within the unit/organization co-signs, along with their
10                                                           AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011

            resources to accomplish their administrative, management, and program
            oversight. Local Purchase Card programs should apply discretion and good
            judgment to determine additional manpower needs if standard general rule is not
            optimal in meeting local needs.
            2.3.2.4.3.2. Card Accounts to AO. Local Purchase Card programs shall be set-up
            to ensure that the ratio of cardholder accounts to AO shall be no more than 7:1. In
            addition, consideration should be given to the number of transactions per
            cardholder and AO is required to review. The A/OPC should evaluate the
            timeliness and effectiveness of the AOs invoice review and certification process
            to ensure that the number of transactions for all card accounts allows the AO to

         procedures allows FMA to certify payment independent of the statement being
         approved by the AO (see paragraph 3.8.4).
            2.3.4.2.3.1. Every effort should be made to accomplish this within 5 workdays,

         temporarily suspended. (This does not apply to contingency accounts.) If these
         accounts remain inactive for a year, the AO should evaluate whether to close them.
     2.3.4.3. At the end of the billing cycle, if the cardholder is absent from his/her duty
     station and cannot log into the Bank’s system to reconcile their transactions, the AO must
     perform these duties on behalf of the cardholder.
  2.3.5. Cardholder: The GPC bears the cardholder’s name and shall only be used by the
  named individual to pay for authorized US Government purchases. The GPC was specially

        cardholder shall confirm with the vendor that the items ordered are in transit and
        reconcile the monthly statement in full anticipation that the supplies will be received
        within the next billing cycle. In this case, the cardholder shall track the transactions
        that have not been received and pay the invoice in full. If the supplies are not received
        within the next billing cycle, the cardholder will then dispute the item using
        established dispute procedures. In addition, pay and confirm procedures include
        damaged items received, which are still under warranty, where the contractor
        confirms he/she will replace, modify, or repair within the next billing cycle. Pay and
        confirm procedures do not include the payment of statements in full which contain
        billing errors or questionable transactions

     secured in a locked container. A cardholder shall not allow anyone to use his/her account
     number. If a GPC is lost or stolen, the cardholder must notify their approving official and
     the Bank immediately (see paragraph 3.5).
     2.3.5.12. Leave or Travel: If the cardholder will be on leave or temporary duty (TDY)
     for an extended period he/she must notify the AO prior to departure and provide whatever
     information the AO deems necessary to act on the cardholder’s behalf. In the
     cardholder’s absence, the AO must, after the end of the billing cycle, log into the Bank’s
     EAS and reconcile all valid transactions. Note: If the cardholder has access to the
     Internet, he/she can reconcile transactions from TDY locations.

        agreements (unless a competitively awarded BPA), cardholders must review prices on
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    15


          at least three contracts/agreements and select the best value for their requirements. A
          record of this review will be kept with the cardholder’s GPC documentation.
          2.3.5.14.2. If less than three sources are available, the cardholder must justify
          restricted competition consideration in writing to the local contracting office for a
          determination prior to purchase IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
          8.405-6 (b). If the contracting officer concurs, a record of this review by the
          contracting office will be kept with the cardholder’s GPC documentation.
          2.3.5.14.3. For each transaction over the micro-purchase threshold, the cardholder
          must collect required information from the vendor, such as Central Contract
          Registration (CCR) data, type of business, etc. This data must be submitted to the
          A/OPC for incorporation into the contract reporting system.
   2.3.6. Government Contractors. Government contractor employees shall not be issued GPCs
   nor shall they be appointed as AOs nor perform independent receipt of goods and services.
   2.3.7. Financial Management Analysis (FMA). The FMA is responsible for providing
   training and advice to cardholders and approving officials on financial issues and the
   appropriate use of funds. The FMA is also responsible for providing a certified funding
   document for each account established and certification of payment invoices. The FMA also
   serves as the liaison between the installation and the paying office.
   2.3.8. Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander (LRSC)/Chief of Supply (COS), director
   or civilian equivalent. The LRSC/COS is encouraged to delete stock levels of commercial
   items but use discretion to accommodate local circumstances. The LRSC/COS informs base
   activities which types of categories of commercial items will no longer be stocked to enable
   the base activities to procure the items through commercial sources. For installations that use
   Logistics Management Control Activities (LMCAs), cardholders may contact LMCA instead
   of the LRSC/COS and the LMCA has the responsibility assigned to the LRSC/COS above.
2.4. The Bank. The following highlights the Bank’s functions and responsibilities:
   2.4.1. Training. The Bank will provide training via their Internet-based training site.
   2.4.2. Card Distribution. The Bank will mail the GPC to the cardholder or designated
   distribution point within 24 hours of receipt of the electronic request.

  day, 365 days a year. These services include, at a minimum, transaction authorization and
  verification, reporting of lost or stolen cards, and cardholder account inquiries.
  2.4.8. Delinquency Standards and Policies. The OSD delinquency goal is that activities may
  not have more than one percent (1%) of their total receivables with the Bank over 30 days
  past due. DoD policy requires the issuing Bank to suspend any billing account that goes over
  60 days delinquent. All accounts under a Managing Account will be suspended should the
  billing account exceed 60 days past due.
     2.4.8.1. If payment for the undisputed principal has not been received 55 days past due,
     the Bank will notify the A/OPC and designated billing office electronically or in writing
     that suspension will take place if the payment is not received by the 5th calendar day after
     notification. The Bank will also provide a point of contact at the Bank to assist in
     resolving the past due account.
     2.4.8.2. If payment for the undisputed principal has not been received 60 days past due,
     the Bank will suspend the account. The suspension will automatically be lifted once the
     undisputed principal amount has been paid.
     2.4.8.3. Requests for suspension exemptions for billing officials with operational
     emergencies may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Exemption requests must be
     submitted in writing from the A/OPC to the Air Force Level 2 point of contact via
     MAJCOM representative. Exemption requests must include a statement describing what
     actions will be taken to resolve account delinquencies.
     2.4.8.4. Billing accounts that exceed 180 days past due will result in the entire activity
     (Level 4) being suspended.

   A/OPC for processing. A primary and alternate AO must be appointed for each managing
   account. The letter of appointment must identify the name, rank, duty title, and telephone
   number of the cardholder and/or approving official, and fully describe the types of purchases
   to be made and requested limits. The letter should also state that the individual has
   successfully accomplished the required training.
   3.2.2. Appointed AOs and Cardholders. The following categories of personnel may be
   appointed AOs and cardholders: government civilian employees, members of the Armed
   Forces, and foreign nationals (both direct and indirect hires) subject to operational control
   and day-to-day management and supervision by US civilian and military personnel. When
   appointing AOs and cardholders, the appointing authority should take into account the
   training, business acumen and judgment of individuals to act on behalf of the Government.
   The appointing authority should also ensure the current responsibilities of the AO will allow
   sufficient time to adequately monitor the purchase activity of the cardholders assigned to
   them. The ratio of cardholder accounts to AO shall be no more than 7:1
   3.2.3. Servicing FMA. Coordination with the servicing FMA is mandatory to ensure that the
   proper funds are allocated for the GPC charges. For new managing accounts, the AO must
   also initiate a request for a funding document, Air Force Government Purchase Card Fund
   Cite Authorization Form, AF Form 4009, from the servicing FMA. The approving official
   must submit subsequent requests for changes to AO limits to the A/OPC in writing (e-mail
   acceptable). The AO must submit subsequent changes to cardholder limits to the A/OPC in

      cardholder limit, an AO’s cycle limit (which encompasses all of the cardholders’ cycle
      limits assigned for any billing cycle) and a funding document limit. All limits must be
      realistic and based on actual spending patterns and funding. In the event spending limits
      are inflated, they should be reduced by the A/OPC.
          3.3.2.1.1. Single Purchase Limit.
              3.3.2.1.1.1. The single purchase limit on the card is normally the micro-purchase
              threshold of $3,000 ($2,500 for services per the Service Contract Act and $2,000
20                                                        AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


             for minor construction as per the Davis-Bacon Act) unless the cardholder is a
             warranted Contracting Officer, or is authorized to place orders from pre-priced
             contractual instruments up to $25,000. Delegation letters should reflect all limits
             as appropriate.
             3.3.2.1.1.2. Authority may also be granted to make purchases up to $25,000 per
             transaction for specific products from priority sources of supply such as the
             Federal Prison Industries, Ability One agencies and the stock programs of GSA
             and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) (see FAR Part 8).
             3.3.2.1.1.3. Training and Education Office personnel shall use the GPC to pay for
             government, commercial off-the-shelf training and education up to $25,000 for an
             individual event or planned series of the same training event, activity, or course
             material.
             3.3.2.1.1.4. Use of Government-wide Purchase Card by OCONUS Units.
             Overseas cardholders may be authorized to use the GPC to make commercial
             commodity and services only purchases up to $25,000 if the purchase is made
             outside the United States from vendors located outside the United States for use
             outside the United States, subject to the requirements specified in DFARS
             213.301. If purchases are made from Continental United States (CONUS)
             vendors for use overseas, the micro-purchase threshold remains in effect. For
             these stateside purchases the cardholder must contact their local Traffic
             Management Office for assistance regarding transportation and packaging
             requirements/instructions prior to contacting the vendor. Cardholders must ensure
             the final price includes all costs associated with the mode of packaging,
             transportation, customs import duties, and any other charges that may accrue.
             Consult DoD 4500.54-G, Foreign Clearance Guide, prior to the requisitioning to
             ensure compliance with host nation customs requirements.
         3.3.2.1.2. Monthly/Cycle Cardholder Limit. The monthly cardholder limit is the total
         dollar value of the cardholder’s GPC purchases allowed for any given monthly billing
         cycle. This limit and the cycle limit are equal amounts. The monthly cardholder
         limit shall be set in increments of $100.
         3.3.2.1.3. Funding Document Limit. The funding document limit is a budgetary limit
         established on the AF Form 4009, by the unit resource advisor in coordination with
         the AO and certified by the FMA. In all instances, the AO shall obtain a certified
         funding document before the card can be used by the cardholder.                    For
         Contingency/Exercise Operations accounts see paragraph 4.1.7 FMAs shall set
         quarterly spending limits on the approving official account at the same dollar value as
         the AF Form 4009. Refer to paragraph 3.7 for more information on funding
         procedures. NOTE: Overspending funds available on the AF Form 4009 will result in
         unit commander or civilian equivalent notification and shall result in suspension of
         the cardholder’s and/or approving official’s GPC privileges and/or other disciplinary
         action.
  3.3.3. Merchant Category Code Group (MCCG). (Previously known as Merchant Activity
  Type (MAT) code.) When initiating a GPC account, the A/OPC shall incorporate the MCCG
  codes that are identified in the requiring organization’s request. Subsequent changes to the
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  21


  MCCG code may be requested from the A/OPC by the approving official (e-mail
  acceptable). MCCG Code 000 is no longer an option and is prohibited by the DoD PC PMO.
  3.3.4. Merchant Category Code (MCC) Blocks. DoD has blocked purchase card transactions
  for certain categories of merchants, such as casinos, hotels, jewelry stores, drinking
  establishments, etc. (see list in 3.3.4.1). These MCCs are automatically applied to cardholder
  account profiles at the time of set-up. A/OPCs can further limit cardholder transactions by
  type of merchant by blocking MCCs for use by a particular cardholder, or by all activity
  cardholders.
     3.3.4.1. Excluded Merchant Category Codes. The following list includes some sample
     situations where purchasing card use may be prohibited. Restrictions may vary by
     agency/organization.

     MCC or other extenuating circumstances.
         3.3.4.2.1. The request must contain the following information: exact dollar amount of
         the transaction, last four digits of cardholder account number, name of cardholder,
         managing account number, vendor name, and justification for the purchase.

 22                                                         AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


          3.3.4.2.3. The Level 2 will review and if approved, notify the Level 3 that the CH has
          5 days to complete the transaction. Note: SAF/AQC GPC Program Manager is the
          only authorized individual who can make exceptions based on proper justification by
          the MAJCOM.
   3.3.5. Receipt of Card. The Bank will mail the GPC to the cardholder within 24 hours after
   receiving the cardholder’s account set-up information. The Bank uses a Voice Response
   Unit (VRU) to verify that the GPC has been received by the cardholder. When the
   cardholder receives the GPC, he/she must immediately access the VRU to activate their card.
   The VRU is accessible toll free (or via direct telephone number for foreign users).
   3.3.6. Issuing Outside of Commands. Commands whose procurement structure requires
   issuing purchase cards to a prospective purchase cardholder not within their command, shall
   follow these guidelines when setting-up the purchase card account.
      3.3.6.1. The issuing command shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
      with the receiving command (the resident command of the purchase cardholder). At a
      minimum the MOU shall address the roles of the key personnel involved (i.e., funds
      administrator, A/OPC, AO, etc).
      3.3.6.2. The Commanding Officer or Head of the Activity of the issuing command shall
      provide either a letter of delegation or contracting officer’s warrant (SF1402) to the
      prospective purchase cardholder(s) of the receiving command in accordance with this
      instruction. Prior to issuing the letter of delegation or contracting officer’s warrant, the
      A/OPC of the issuing command will ensure that the prospective purchase cardholder
      meets all of the requirements for becoming a purchase cardholder or contracting officer.
      3.3.6.3. The issuing command is responsible for funds management related to the issued
      purchase cards. This includes ensuring the proper types and kinds of funding are
      provided as well as ensuring the integrity of the funding lines of accounting.
      3.3.6.4. The issuing command is responsible for oversight of the purchase card
      transactions and shall conduct reviews in accordance with this instruction. Disciplinary
      action, as required, is also the responsibility of the issuing command with concurrence
      from the commanding officer of the purchase cardholder’s command. Copies of the
      review results will be forwarded to the commanding officer of the purchase cardholder’s
      command.
      3.3.6.5. The receiving command is responsible for exercising appropriate command and
      control supervision over the purchase cardholder within the command structure. Internal
      reviews shall be conducted by the receiving command on a semi-annual basis with the

      3.4.1.1. Cardholder. At least 60 days prior to reassignment, separation, retirement, etc., a
      cardholder shall surrender the GPC to the AO along with a record of all outstanding
      purchases that have yet to be received or billed to their GPC account and credits due.
      The cardholder shall also provide their forwarding address and phone number. If there are
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                         23


       no pending transactions, the cardholder shall provide a memo stating there are no
       outstanding purchases chargeable to the account or credits due.
       3.4.1.2. Approving Official. When all transactions (charges and/or credits) have cleared
       the Bank and the card has been destroyed, the AO shall forward a written statement to the
       A/OPC requesting to permanently cancel the account. An e-mail notification is
       acceptable. At the time of the cancellation request, CH documentation will be turned
       over to the AO and maintained in accordance with paragraph 3.6.15 The AO should also
       perform an in-depth surveillance of the CHs records in conjunction with the cancellation
       request.
       3.4.1.3. A/OPC. The A/OPC will cancel the account and at the discretion of the A/OPC,
       close-out surveillance.
   3.4.2. Base Closure. Most GPC accounts should be closed before the base is closed. A/OPC
   shall contact the Bank and arrange for transfer of the paying function to a successor finance
   office and transfer of the program management responsibilities to an appropriate contracting
   office. The Air Force Base Closure Agency (AFBCA) should be contacted regarding
   program management for closing closed installations. The A/OPC shall contact the
   MAJCOM Level 3 GPC Program Manager for appropriate Base Closure and AFBCA
   coordination instructions.
   3.4.3. Inactive Accounts. If the A/OPC identifies a cardholder account that has not been
   used in the previous six months he/she should consider closing the account unless the
   supervisor submits an acceptable justification to keep the account active.
3.5. Lost or Stolen Cards. The cardholder shall notify the Bank and AO immediately upon
learning the card is lost or stolen. The AO shall then submit a written report (e-mail acceptable)
to the A/OPC within five (5) days that should include:
   3.5.1. Card account number,
   3.5.2. Cardholder’s complete name,
   3.5.3. Date and location loss became evident,
   3.5.4. Date and time the Bank was notified as well as, if applicable, date/time reported to the
   police,
   3.5.5. Last purchases made on the card before it was discovered lost or stolen, and
   3.5.6. Any other pertinent information.
A new GPC will be mailed within 24 hours of the reported loss or theft (Monday through
Friday). For international card replacement, the Bank will replace lost or stolen cards within 48
hours of the reported loss or theft. If the cardholder finds the original GPC, it shall be cut in half
and given to the AO. The AO will complete the destruction notice and forward it to the A/OPC.
The A/OPC will contact the Bank to ensure the account is closed.
3.6. Making GPC Purchases
   3.6.1. Applicable Policies. Cardholders and approving officials must ensure that all
   acquisition, supply, and finance policies and regulations apply to GPC purchases.
24                                                         AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


  3.6.2. Purchase Limits. Cardholders must ensure purchase limits assigned to the card
  account are not exceeded. The total amount of a single purchase will be comprised of
  multiple items, but it may not exceed the authorized single purchase limit. Purchases will be
  denied if the authorized single purchase limit, monthly spending limit, or quarterly spending
  limit is exceeded. Cardholders should also ensure that funds are available to pay for items
  being purchased. Only firm-fixed price transactions are authorized to include shipping.
  3.6.3. Shipping Costs. Ensure the vendor is responsible for delivery to the location the
  cardholder identifies when ordering, referred to as ―free on board‖ (FOB destination), if
  possible. The vendor may separately identify shipping charges on an invoice, but these costs
  will be included in the single transaction when the purchase is made. All items
  purchased/ordered should, in most cases, be available by the end of the next billing cycle.
  The item should be received or the service completed before the item appears on a statement
  of account. The Bank’s electronic access system does allow for approval of and payment for
  partial shipments. Approving Officials have the discretion to authorize partial shipments;
  however, cardholders must track the remaining items to ensure they are received in a timely
  manner.
  3.6.4. Tax Exempt. For each purchase, the cardholder shall inform the merchant that it is for
  official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, not subject to state or local sales tax. The
  card is embossed with ―U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT‖ for additional clarification. Each
  cardholder is responsible for providing the tax-exempt number to the merchant if requested
  to do so. NOTE: Overseas cardholders are not exempt from paying foreign taxes unless
  foreign tax agreements so specify. Also, the Federal Government is not exempt from certain
  federal and state excise taxes or other taxes that the vendor may be required to pay, such as,
  New Mexico’s Gross Receipts Tax, Arizona’s Transaction Privilege Tax, or Cell Phone
  Excise Tax.
  3.6.5. Distribute Suppliers. GPC micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among
  qualified suppliers, in accordance with FAR 13.202(a)(1).
  3.6.6. Priority Sources. Ensure supplies or services provided by required (statutory) sources
  of supply in accordance with FAR Part 8 (FPI, AbilityOne Program as implemented by
  NIB/NISH, etc.) are purchased/ordered from these sources.
  3.6.7. Price. Ensure that a reasonable price is obtained. Comparing prices offered by other
  vendors for the same or similar item or service is the preferred method to determine prices as
  being fair and reasonable. If suppliers furnish standing price quotations or catalog prices on
  a recurring basis, obtaining competition on individual purchases is not necessary, but the
  prices should be periodically confirmed as current. When determining the number of sources
  to solicit, consider the nature of the item or service to be purchased and whether it is highly
  competitive; information from recent purchases of the same or similar items or services; the
  urgency of the purchase; the dollar value of the purchase; and past experience concerning
  dealer prices.
  3.6.8. Green Procurement Program (GPP). Cardholders are responsible for procuring green
  products and services in accordance with Federal laws and regulations; Executive Orders
  13423, and DoD and Air Force Policies that drive GPP. Green procurement applies to the
  purchase of recovered materials, energy and water efficient products, alternative fuels and
  fuel efficiency, biobased products, non-ozone depleting substances, environmentally
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   25


   preferable products and services, and toxic and hazardous chemicals (see paragraph 4.2.1).
   The cardholder must complete the GPP training (per paragraph 3.1.4.2.).
   3.6.9. Order Management Log. Cardholders must document all GPC transactions in the
   electronic order management log (including over-the-counter purchases) provided by the
   Bank at the time of purchase. Itemized receipts (cash register receipts or tickets, invoices,
   shipping/packing documents or receiving reports, or electronic purchase confirmations are
   acceptable) for each purchase and other supporting documentation such as special approvals
   shall be maintained and be available for monthly review by the approving official and the
   A/OPC upon request.
   3.6.10. Purchasing of Office Supplies.
       3.6.10.1. GPC cardholders must purchase office supplies on-line with maximum use of
       established Federal, DoD, or Air Force-wide buying arrangements, or from the local
       AbilityOne Base Supply store. Effective 1 Oct 2011 all CONUS Air Force contracting
       offices and purchase cardholders must use the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative
       (FSSI) Office Supply BPAs to purchase office supplies. The FSSI BPAs are currently
       available on the Air Force Advantage website. The only exception is for the purchase of
       toner cartridges. Due to highly competitive pricing on toner, it is important to check
       prices on both FSSI and the Air Force Toner BPAs available on AFWAY for the specific
       toner cartridge needed.
       3.6.10.2. Compliance with mandatory priority and source requirements (FAR Part 8.002)
       still applies.
   3.6.11. Mail or Telephone Order Purchases. When placing a telephone order to be paid using
   the GPC, the cardholder shall:
       3.6.11.1. Notify the vendor that the purchase is tax-exempt. Provide the tax-exempt
       number to the merchant if requested.
       3.6.11.2. Confirm the vendor agrees to charge the GPC when shipment is made so that
       receipt of the supplies may be certified on the Statement of Accounts for that billing
       cycle.
       3.6.11.3. Instruct the vendor to include the following information on the shipping
       document or packing slip to alert the receiving offices and requisitioning office that the
       supplies have been purchased with the GPC:
a. Cardholder name and correspondence symbol

b. Building number, room number, street address, city and state

c. Cardholder telephone number

d. The term ―Government-wide Purchase Card‖
   3.6.12. Internet Purchases. Internet purchases must be limited to those web sites that provide
   secure transaction safeguards. Purchases made via the Internet must comply with the
   requirements of paragraph 3.6.11 to the maximum extent practicable, subject to the
   limitations of the web site.

   3.6.13. Manufacturer/Retailer Rebates. Cardholders should take advantage of any rebates
   offered. Manufacturer/retailer rebates shall be made payable or endorsed to the United States
   Treasury. All rebates, in the form of checks or cash, should be forwarded to the FMA
   immediately. Rebates will be processed as an appropriation refund to the applicable funding
   document.
   3.6.14. Receipt, Accountability, and Disposal of Property.
       3.6.14.1. The cardholder shall obtain independent verification of receipt of all items
       purchased using the GPC. The cardholder shall notify the property custodian of all
       accountable or sensitive property, including pilferable items, regardless of their dollar
       value, upon their receipt.
Examples of such items include cell phones, digital cameras, fax machines, palm pilots, copiers
and printers. The person verifying receipt must sign, date and write "received" on the vendor
receipt, sales receipt, shipping document, credit card receipt, or equivalent document. The
individual verifying receipt may be the cardholder's AO, supervisor, or other designated
individual, as appropriate.
       3.6.14.2. For equipment items equal to or under the micro-purchase threshold,
       accountability is the responsibility of unit commander or civilian equivalent. Unit
       commanders must have adequate controls in place to ensure items purchased using the
       GPC and requiring accountability is accounted for in the appropriate property book (Air
       Force Equipment Management System, Standard Base Supply System, Information
       Technology Asset Management). Unit commanders must establish a locally devised
       program that provides visibility and audit trail capability. This may include use of hand
       receipts and spreadsheets. These records shall include all items considered pilferable or
       easily resalable on the open market. See Department of Defense Instruction 5000.64 and
       AFI 23-111, “Management of Government Property in the Possession of the Air Force,‖
       for policy on accountability and/or responsible officer responsibility. For accountability
       requirements for equipment items valued in excess of the micro-purchase procedures see
       paragraph 4.3.1 and AFMAN 23-110, ―USAF Supply Manual‖ Volume 2.
       3.6.14.3. Computer equipment and software must be accounted for in accordance with
       AFI 33-101, Communications and Information Management Guidance and
       Responsibilities.
       3.6.14.4. Disposal of Property. Base supply should be consulted for proper disposal
       instructions to avoid waste and mismanagement of all equipment; accountable and non
       accountable.
   3.6.15. Document Retention.      Reference AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
   containing the GPC disposition rules in accordance with Table 64-04, Rule 26.00–26.04.
   AF     RDS     supersedes    AFMAN       37-139    and    is   available  on-line   at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm In the event of a conflict between
   the AF RDS and this AFI, the rules contained in RDS take precedence. The following
   documentation shall be maintained:
       3.6.15.1. Supporting Documentation. Documents received and/or generated by CHs and
       AOs to support transactions (includes: receipts, shipping paperwork, written record of
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                     27


      coordination, all other supporting documentation, records of approving official
      surveillance) shall be retained for three years after final payment (Rule 26.01).
      3.6.15.2. Electronic Access System (EAS) Documents. GPC order management log and
      all data generated or processed in the Bank’s EAS is maintained by the Bank for six years
      and three months.
      3.6.15.3. A/OPC Office Documents:
          3.6.15.3.1. Individual Account Files. These files consist of training records, letters of
          appointment and delegation of purchase authority, destroy after two years (Rule
          26.04).
          3.6.15.3.2. Administrative Support. Documents consisting of administrative support
          and control of the GPC program and associated reports, including records of
          surveillance and all other administrative actions, destroy after three years (Rule
          26.00).
      3.6.15.4. Records Under Investigation, Dispute, or Similar Matters. Any record
      pertinent to a dispute, investigation or similar matter, destroy six months after final
      clearance or settlement (including time allotted for appeals) (Rule 26.02) or destroy after
      the retention period specified for credit cards under Table 64-04, whichever is later.
   3.6.16. Reconciliation and Payment Procedures
      3.6.16.1. Resolving Problems with the Statement of Account (SOA). Cardholders should
      try resolving problems directly with the vendor. In most cases, cardholders will be able
      to resolve problems by contacting the vendor. If problems cannot be resolved with the
      vendor, the cardholder must dispute the item on their statement of accounts via the
      Bank’s electronic access system. Disputes must be filed within 90 days of posting date of
      the transaction.
      3.6.16.2. If the dispute charge involves sales tax or transportation costs charged
      erroneously by the merchant, the amount of the tax or erroneous transportation costs
      cannot be disputed through Visa Chargeback Regulations. Cardholder shall make every
      effort to obtain a credit for the amount of the tax or transportation costs from the
      merchant. If a credit is not obtained, ordering agencies must pay the tax or transportation
      costs. The cardholder should document the file accordingly. The cardholder should
      request assistance from the A/OPC if he/she is unsuccessful in recovering the taxes paid
      from the merchant.
      3.6.16.3. If items purchased with the card are found to be defective, the cardholder shall
      obtain a replacement or correction of the item as soon as possible. If the merchant
      refuses to replace or correct the faulty item, the cardholder will consider the item in
      dispute. Items in dispute are handled in the same manner as billing errors.
3.7. Financial Management Analysis (FMA)
   3.7.1. General. The FMA is responsible for providing training and advice to cardholders and
   approving officials on financial issues, account reconciliation and confirmation, certification
   procedures, and the appropriate use of funds. The FMA is also responsible for providing a
   certified funding document for each account established and certification of payment
   invoices. The FMA also serves as the liaison between the installation and the paying office.
28                                                       AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


  3.7.2. Funding Document (see Attachment 3). The Government Purchase Card Fund Cite
  Authorization Document, AF Form 4009, is to be used to designate the accounting
  classification to be charged at the time of payment for all purchases made by cardholders
  assigned to the respective account. A funding document with $1 may be established in order
  to designate a Master Account Code for Contingency Contracting Officers who will be
  purchasing in support of contingencies or exercises.
     3.7.2.1. The AF Form 4009 is used as a funding document and to record commitments
     into the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS). Sufficient funds, an amount equal
     to or greater than the amount of the purchase, must be loaded in the system prior to
     making a purchase. Commitments are not posted directly to the General Accounting and
     Finance System Base Level (GAFS-BL). The AF Form 4009 is also used to generate the
     default line of accounting for each managing account number. The FMA is required to
     input quarterly limits equal to the amount of the AF Form 4009 in the first quarter. At
     the beginning of the second, third, and fourth quarters the FMA may leave the same
     quarterly limit or increase the amount for that quarter by the residual balance of the
     previous quarter. The managing account number, also referred to as the approving
     official account number, consists of 16 digits. The master account number block of the
     AF Form 4009 must include the full 16 digit managing account number. The AF Form
     4009 document number consists of the last 12 digits of the managing account number
     plus a 2 digit fiscal year designator, a total of 14 digits. Example: If the managing
     account number is 4716 3045 1234 5678 and the fiscal year is 05; then the document
     number on the AF Form 4009 would be 30451234567805.
     3.7.2.2. Commitments are not loaded in IAPS for Stock Fund Accounts such as Medical
     and Dental Accounts (Fund Code 6B) or for Centrally Managed Accounts such as the
     Military Personnel Account (Fund Code 32) as non-addressable entries. The AF Form
     4009 should be prepared and entered with an XPSR/XDSR address to control the
     quarterly spending limit. Fund certification is not required. The Managing Account
     Number, full line of accounting and Stock Record Account Number for Stock Fund
     accounts are required to be provided to the DFAS Field Site point of contact to allow the
     contract to be established manually.
     3.7.2.3. Funding shall be issued on a quarterly basis. In most cases, the AF Form 4009
     expiration date is annual (1 October through 30 September). Any other expiration date
     should be coordinated with the A/OPC and Financial Analysis Office.
     3.7.2.4. Limit fund cites to the funds supporting the operation of the organization to
     which the funding document is issued. Funding documents may not be issued that would
     result in ―cross disbursements‖ or ―for others.‖
         3.7.2.4.1. If O&M funds are used, use the predominant Element of
         Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) that applies to the majority of the purchases to be
         made on the account. If there is no predominant EEIC, use 61950. (Not applicable to
         accounting classifications not requiring an EEIC). Authorized medical logistics
         personnel will use Medical Dental Division (MDD) fund cites and process purchases
         through the current medical logistics Accounting Information System (AIS) to
         appropriately expense issues to O&M funded activities.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                      29


       3.7.2.5. The FMA shall certify funds availability on the funding document. The funding
       certification is a qualified certification. The certification is accomplished at the time the
       funding document is issued and it does not have to be re-certified each quarter. If funds
       are not available, notify the approving official that purchases cannot be made on the
       account until notification is received that funds are available. The FMA must notify the
       A/OPC of any account that lacks sufficient funds to cover its purchases.
       3.7.2.6. Recording Commitments. The posting of the commitment amount is in IAPS.
       IAPS then records the commitment amount in GAFS-BL. Basically, the commitment is
       entered into IAPS, recorded in IAPS and the IAPS interface with GAFS-BL records the
       commitment in GAFS-BL. At the beginning of the second, third, and fourth quarter,
       increase the existing amount by the quarterly commitment amount shown on the funding
       document, as applicable. See the payment office procedures in paragraph 3.9 below for
       de-commitment and obligation recording.
       3.7.2.7. Centrally Managed Allotment (CMAs). Funding documents are required for
       cards that make purchases that are paid from CMAs such as subsistence-in-kind
       purchases from the commissary. The FMA will establish a management account number
       for these funding documents and verify that the fund cite is correct. No fund certification
       is required.
   3.7.3. Fiscal Year End Close-out Procedures.
       3.7.3.1. Introduction. The following procedures apply to all Air Force automated
       Government Purchase Card accounts. These procedures are provided to assist with
       understanding the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS) functionality developed to
       support fiscal year closeout and roll over of the GPC accounts. American National
       Standards Institute (ANSI) X-12 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are
       utilized to pass financial data from the Bank to the Defense Finance and Accounting
       Service (DFAS). EDI transactions are transmitted to the Global Exchange (GEX) where
       they are translated into user defined format files that are then routed to the IAPS for
       processing. Current ANSI X-12 EDI transactions are:
ANSI X-12 821 Financial Data transactions: used to record an obligation and/or an accrued
expenditure unpaid (AEU) balances in accounting records for each master account number.

ANSI X-12 810 Certified Invoice transactions: used to liquidate AEU balances and to record
disbursements for the certified amount for each master account.
       3.7.3.2. September Cycle.
          3.7.3.2.1. The following applies to all 821 transactions received and processed in
          IAPS. An AEU balance will be recorded in the accounting system rather than an
          obligation balance. The September cycle close date is September 19th for active Air
          Force accounts. NOTE: Requirement to record AEU balances does not apply to
          Medical Dental Working Capital Fund (WCF) (Fund Code 6B) accounts. Accruals
          for Medical dental accounts are recorded based on actual receipts processed through
          the Medical Logistics system.
          3.7.3.2.2. The September cycle will be processed as usual. Every effort must be
          taken to ensure all 821 transactions have successfully processed prior to September
30                                                         AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


        29th. This is to ensure that all expenses are accounted for in the fiscal year in which
        they accrue.
     3.7.3.3. Closeout and Rollover of GPC Accounts.
        3.7.3.3.1. An IAPS fiscal year-end program (NTQYG0) will be executed in late
        September of each fiscal year. The exact date will be determined by the DFAS IAPS
        Systems Office in conjunction with SAF/FMP (AFAFO). This program will be used
        to close out the commitment balance on all GPC accounts loaded in IAPS. Residual
        commitment balance of $1 dollar or more will be used to fund a yearend computer
        generated AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document
        (MORD) that will be retained to fund prior fiscal year transactions for those accounts.
        IAPS will also create a one-time contract record for each MORD generated. The
        MORD/Contract Number will be the same as the AF 4009 number used to fund the
        MORD. (NOTE: AF 4009 numbers are equal to the last twelve positions of the
        master account number followed by a two-position fiscal year. For example:
        30455512345602.) Note: Commitments will not convert to a MORD for three
        reasons; commitment is in status, commitment is expired, or balance is less than $1.
        3.7.3.3.2. A MORD will not be generated for any commitment record with a balance
        of less than $1. To ensure a MORD is generated and is available to pay subsequent
        bills every Approving Official (AO) and Financial Management Analysis (FMA)
        must ensure that a commitment amount is recorded in IAPS on their AF Form 4009
        and is sufficient enough to cover unbilled charges. A MORD will not be created for
        Medical Dental WCF (Fund Code 6B) accounts and any unbilled charges will be
        charged against the Master Contract Record for the account at the time of billing.
        3.7.3.3.3. A three-part report will be generated for each IAPS Site ID and will
        provide the results of the closeout program. Part 1 is a Reconciliation Error List that
        shows all account numbers and reasons why a MORD was not generated. Part 2 is the
        Converted Purchase Request to MORD List that provides the account numbers for
        which a MORD was generated and the balance that was transferred to the MORD.
        Part 3 is a list of existing current year GPC MORDs. All balances transferred to the
        MORD are de-committed and the MORD balance is recorded as an AEU balance in
        the applicable accounting system.
        3.7.3.3.4. Once all applicable balances have been transferred to a MORD contract,
        IAPS will de-commit all remaining balances in all prior year AF 4009 records.
     3.7.3.4. Month 13 Billing Cycle.
        3.7.3.4.1. On or about October 3 the Bank will generate a special fiscal year-end bill
        referred to as Month 13. The Month 13 cycle close date will be October 2 and will
        include charges for all purchases received and posted by the Bank between the
        September cycle close date and the Month 13 cycle close date. The Bank system is
        designed to generate bills based on the Post Date of the transaction. For that reason,
        and to allow for a normal processing time of two days between Purchase Date and
        Post Date at the Bank, all transactions with a Post Date of October 2, or earlier will be
        included in the Month 13 billing cycle. If a transaction is erroneously charged to the
        prior fiscal year, the approving official may provide receipts or other dated evidence
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                         31


           that supports processing of a SF 1081, Schedule of Voucher Correction to transfer the
           charge to current year. Screen prints of the vendor bank’s electronic order log
           (transaction log) are also considered acceptable evidence to support the transfer if it
           shows that the purchase date was in a different fiscal year than was actually charged.
           3.7.3.4.2. Normal EDI transactions (821s) will be generated by the Bank for the
           Month 13 cycle and will flow to the Global Exchange (GEX) the night of October 3rd
           and subsequently to IAPS for processing. Normal IAPS processing of the Month 13
           cycle applies except that the yearend MORD will be used to fund the billed amount.
           The amount recorded on the MORD was previously recorded as an AEU balance so
           no accounting entry will be made at time of processing of the 821s.
           3.7.3.4.3. The FMA will certify the Month 13 cycle the same as all other monthly
           cycles and their certification of the Month 13 Summary Invoice will result in the 810
           transactions flowing to DFAS for payment processing. At time of processing of the
           810 transactions, the available balance recorded on the MORD will be reduced by the
           amount of the certified invoice. Accounting transactions will be processed in the
           applicable accounting system to reduce the AEU balance and record the
           disbursement. Any residual AEU balance will be reduced to zero in IAPS and the
           MORD will be deleted out of IAPS. The residual balance and the MORD will be left
           recorded in the accounting system with the residual AEU balance. AEU balances
           left recorded in the accounting system are available for future charges resulting from
           processing of a SF 1081 to transfer purchases charged to current year funds that
           should have been charged to prior year funds. FMA personnel must ensure that all
           available balances are liquidated or re-validated not later than six months into the new
           fiscal year.
       3.7.3.5. Updating Lines of Accounting. The Bank will automatically update all
       appropriations in all IAPS/GAFS Parent and Child Rule Sets to reflect new fiscal year
       values. The following rules will apply to the update of all applicable appropriations:
Rule 1 – Where current fiscal year (example 2002) appears in positions 7 through 10 of the
appropriation value the increment position 6 and position 10 by 1 and replace values in those
positions.

Rule 2 – Delete all appropriations for Parent Rule Sets that have a fiscal year less than current
fiscal year (example 2002) in positions 7 through 10.
   3.7.4. Certification of the Invoice for Payment. GPC invoices will be paid using ―Pay and
   Confirm‖ procedures. The FMA will designate a certifying officer to certify the monthly
   installation invoices for payment prior to receipt of the confirmation statements from the
   approving officials. (For detailed certifying officer procedures, see Attachment 2.)
       3.7.4.1. The FMA is the office designated to receive the invoice for the GPC program.
       Upon receipt of the official invoice, the FMA will verify the amount remaining on each
       funding document is sufficient to cover the total amount of the invoice.
       3.7.4.2. If the Managing Account Number is not shown in the accounting code line on
       the invoice, the FMA will annotate the applicable funding document numbers for each
       account on the invoice and certify the invoice for payment on a ―pay and confirm‖ basis.
32                                                        AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     The FMA will contact the A/OPC to update the approving officials account setup
     information.
     3.7.4.3. The FMA will not reconcile approving official certified SOAs with invoices paid
     prior to certifying the invoice for payment.
     3.7.4.4. Cardholders and approving officials will verify the statements and resolve any
     irregularities through the dispute process. Disputes will be resolved between the
     cardholder and the vendor to the maximum extent possible. If the dispute cannot be
     resolved with the vendor, follow the process described in paragraph 3.6.16.
  3.7.5. Cancellation of Approving Official and/or Cardholder Accounts.
     3.7.5.1. Upon reassignment, separation, or retirement, the approving official must turn in
     his/her funding document to the FMA. If a new approving official is being assigned, a
     replacement funding document should be issued to the new approving official. The
     replacement funding document may be assigned the same Management Account Number
     if the fund cite remains the same and the new approving official agrees to assume
     responsibility for the pre-existing funding document. All cardholder accounts remain
     active under the new approving official and those cardholders will continue to be able to
     make purchases.
         3.7.5.1.1. If the new funding document is issued with a different Management
         Account Number, and the fund site remains the same, the cardholder’s account setup
         information must be updated with the new Management Account Number. After
         updating the Management Account Number, all cardholder’s accounts will remain
         active under the new approving official.
         3.7.5.1.2. If a new funding document with a different fund cite is issued to a new
         approving official, all cardholders assigned must establish new accounts with the new
         Management Account Number. The departing approving official must close and
         reconcile their account with the FMA. All cardholders assigned to the old account
         must turn in their cards.
     3.7.5.2. Upon reassignment, separation, or retirement, the cardholder must surrender
     his/her card(s). The approving official shall request the FMA to adjust funds authorized
     on the funding document, if necessary. Normally, if another cardholder is assigned to
     replace the previous cardholder, an adjustment should not be necessary.
  3.7.6. Cost Reallocation Procedures.
     3.7.6.1. Reallocation of Expenses.
         3.7.6.1.1. The Air Force version of GPC provides the capability to reallocate
         expenses within the same appropriation. This capability used to process reallocations
         is the ANSI X12 – 821-CT (Cost Transfer). All purchases initially received and
         posted to a cardholder account at the Bank are assigned the default line of accounting
         current for the account at the time of posting. The default line of accounting is the
         same line of accounting that is current on the AF Form 4009. The default line of
         accounting is also the lines of accounting loaded in IAPS for processing of all 821
         and 810 transactions received in monthly billing cycles.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                     33


        3.7.6.1.2. The FMA may pre-authorize any approving official and cardholder to
        reallocate expenses to a different line of accounting so long as the new line of
        accounting cites the same appropriation. The different line of accounting is referred
        to as an alternate line of accounting (alternate LOAs). Alternate lines of accounting
        are established by the FMA and are assigned names to allow cardholders or
        approving officials to more quickly identify the appropriate alternate LOA for
        transfer of the charges. Example, an alternate LOA may be named ―TRAINING‖ or
        it may be named ―PRINTING‖. The name should also include other identifying
        information such as Responsibility Center/ Cost Center (RC/CC) or DODAAC to
        make maintenance easier. The fiscal year should not be included in the name since
        the Bank will automatically convert the fiscal year in all alternate LOAs.
        3.7.6.1.3. Approving officials or cardholders authorized to use the reallocation
        function in the bank system may enter their request to reallocate a charge at any time
        after the purchase has been posted in the bank system by the merchant. Reallocations
        request may be made based on a percentage of the purchase amount or based on any
        portion of the total amount. However, all reallocation must zero balance. This means
        that any amount removed from the default line of accounting must be reallocated to
        another or multiple LOAs if authorized. Reallocations can only be made to ALOAs
        that have been previously authorized by the FMA.
        3.7.6.1.4. Even though a purchase has been re-allocated, the original default line of
        accounting will be charged on the monthly billing cycle. If the monthly amount to be
        billed on the master account is a positive amount and greater than zero, the
        reallocation request will be honored and an 821-CT transaction will be generated by
        the bank system at the close of the next billing cycle. Example: A reallocation
        request for a purchase billed in March cycle invoice (810) will result in an 821-CT
        flowing to the applicable DFAS accounting system on the close date of the April
        cycle. This allows the initial expense recorded by the 810 transactions and the re-
        allocation recorded by the 821-CT to be processed in the same accounting month.
        3.7.6.1.5. In no case may an alternate LOA be assigned to a cardholder or approving
        official that has a different appropriation in the alternate line than is in their default
        LOA. This is required because reallocation transactions are Journal Voucher level
        entries that are posted directly to the accounting system. Alternate LOAs must also
        have the same fiscal year in the appropriation reallocation of expenses between fiscal
        years is not authorized. If a purchase is initially charged to the wrong fiscal year, it
        must be transferred to the correct year by use of a SF 1081, Schedule of Voucher
        Correction.
        3.7.6.1.6. Reallocations entered in the bank system between the close of the August
        cycle and the start date of the first cycle of each fiscal year will not be processed. This
        is necessary to ensure all re-allocation are processed with the same fiscal year in the
        alternate LOA and in the default LOA. Example: The August 2002 cycle ends on 19
        Aug 2002 for all Air Force accounts. A transaction posted at the vendor bank
        between those dates and 3 Oct 2002 may not be reallocated. This is necessary
        because reallocations of purchases posted after the August 19th cycle close dates will
        not be billed until the September cycle. The Cost-Transfer transactions would not
 34                                                        AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


          flow until the close of the October cycle and that would result in a transfer between
          fiscal years.
   3.7.7. GPC Rebates/Credits.
      3.7.7.1. GPC Rebates/Credits. During the year, the Bank provides rebates in the form of
      credits to the management accounts/cardholder accounts, based on sales and prompt
      payment. In most cases, rebates will be electronically returned to the management
      accounts/cardholder accounts and appear in the form of a credit on the billing statement
      and automatically deducted from the outstanding balance. Reimbursements such as
      rebates, merchant credits, or other credits attributable to accounts closed during the
      quarter or accounts not having enough purchases to offset the credit, require the
      performing bank to issue checks to the applicable A/OPC. Quarterly, when applied to an
      account that does not have enough purchases, debits, to offset the credit, a reimbursement
      check will be sent to the appropriate A/OPC. Merchant credits must be applied back to
      the funding appropriation. Rebates however, have no appropriation attached to them and
      may be used in the fiscal year they are received. The A/OPC must ensure delivery of any
      check to their servicing FMA for appropriate redistribution per the itemized breakout
      listing of amounts associated with each LOA. Each A/OPC is directed to deliver all
      reimbursement checks to their FMA within five (5) days of receipt and is responsible for
      maintaining written documentation of the reimbursement process to include the Cash
      Collection Voucher, DD Form 1131. Rebates/credits may be credited to the unit’s bottom
      line and does not necessarily warrant adjusting the AF 4009. The cardholder, approving
      official, and resource advisor should have a process to ensure adequate controls are in
      place to track credits and rebates. Questions related to reimbursements in the form of a
      rebate, merchant credit, or other credit should be directed to your local FM.
3.8. Financial Management Requirements. The Department of Defense (DoD) Financial
Management Regulation (FMR) provides overall financial management policy governing all
financial transactions within the Department including purchase card transactions. The DoD
FMR web site address is http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr.
   3.8.1. Funding Requirements.
      3.8.1.1. AF activities shall bulk fund, to the maximum extent practical, all purchase card
      transactions.
      3.8.1.2. A/OPCs, AOs and CHs shall ensure that proper purchase card transaction
      information is being recorded into their respective accounting and bill paying systems.
      These key functions should work with their Resource Financial Manager/Comptroller.
   3.8.2. Certifying Officers.
      3.8.2.1. Air Force activities will nominate and appoint AOs as Certifying Officers in
      accordance with the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR). Certifying Officers
      are held pecuniarily liable for payments they certify.
   3.8.3. Cardholder Responsibility. The cardholder will be held pecuniarily liable, as an
   Accountable Official to the Government for the amount of any payment certified and paid
   based on false or negligent information provided to the Certifying Officer. Under 18 USC
   287, misuse of the purchase card could result in a fine of not more than $10,000 or
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                       35


   imprisonment for not more than five years or both. Military members who misuse the
   purchase card are subject to court martial under 10 USC 932, UCMJ Art. 132.
   3.8.4. Pay and Confirm Procedures. Air Force activities operating a Purchase Card program
   shall only institute pay and confirm procedures as part of their financial management
   program. Pay and confirm procedures allow FMA to certify payment independent of the
   statement being approved by the AO.
   3.8.5. Disputes and Fraudulent Transactions.
       3.8.5.1. Disputable Charges. Disputes involving the following items must be handled
       between the cardholder and the Bank (with notification to the A/OPC): duplicate billing,
       non-receipt of merchandise, returned merchandise, canceled merchandise or services,
       invoice amount discrepancies and/or the transaction was paid by other means. Prior to
       submitting a formal dispute form, the cardholder must initiate communication with the
       Bank and notify the Agency Program Coordinator of the dispute. The Purchase Card
       Desk Guide provides the detailed process for communicating with the Bank. Once a
       dispute has been filed, the Bank will suspend the disputed charge from the outstanding
       balance due, issue a provisional credit and acknowledge initiation of the dispute to the
       cardholder. Based on the outcome of the dispute process, the charge will either be
       resolved in favor of the cardholder or the merchant. If the dispute is resolved in favor of
       the cardholder, the charge is removed from the account. If the dispute is resolved in
       favor of the merchant, a letter will be sent to the cardholder explaining the decision and
       the charge will appear in the balance due on the next invoice. It is recommended that the
       cardholder try resolving the dispute with the vendor first, then, if appropriate, file a
       dispute if the credit is not received on the next billing cycle. All dispute documentation
       should be retained by the cardholder for 6 years and 3 months.
       3.8.5.2. Non-disputable Charges. Charges on the cardholder statement that involve
       misuse or abuse by the cardholder are not disputable with the Bank. If the transaction was
       processed in accordance with the controls established (i.e., within the purchase limits, not
       from a vendor with a blocked Merchant Category Code) then the Bank has fulfilled its
       responsibilities under the contract and the government is obligated to make payment for
       the transaction. The government must seek restitution from the employee for any losses
       as a result of their improper transaction. Accordingly, transactions that are determined to
       be fraudulent (i.e., use of a lost or stolen card) or unauthorized by the cardholder shall not
       be certified for payment. A formal dispute will be initiated with the bank and the invoice
       shall be ―short paid‖ by the amount of the transaction(s) in question using the manual
       certification process.
           3.8.5.2.1. Convenience Check transactions, transportation charges, and any form of
           taxes cannot be disputed through the Bank. These must be resolved directly with the
           merchant.
3.9. DFAS Processing. The DFAS Site supporting the activity for accounting and vendor
payments will be responsible for receipt and processing of all ANSI X12 821
(obligation/Accrual) transactions and ANSI X12 810 (Certified Invoices). The 821 transactions
are generated by the Bank on the first business day following the close of the monthly cycle.
The cycle close date for the active Air Force is the 19th of each month or the last business day
prior to the 19th, if the 19th falls on a weekend or holiday. The cycle close date for the Air
 36                                                          AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


National Guard (ANG) is the 23rd or the last business day prior to the 23rd if the 23rd falls on a
weekend or holiday.
   3.9.1. Processing 821 Transactions. The 821 transactions will automatically be processed in
   the first IAPS update following receipt of the 821 transactions. Results of processing the 821
   will appear on the TQ-157 Report (all accepted and non-fixable transaction) and the TQ-164
   (pre-edit report). The Accounts Payable area of the supporting DFAS Vendor Pay office will
   be responsible for correcting any rejects (TQ-164) of 821 transactions for the active Air
   Force sites during the 3-day rotation process, therefore allowing transaction to be processed
   electronically. The ANG site will be responsible for correcting and processing of any rejected
   821 transactions for their ANG site. Processing of 821 transactions will result in recording of
   an obligation for the full amount of purchases for the cycle and the commitment balance
   recorded in IAPS will be de-committed if applicable for the amount of the recorded
   obligation. Note: The 821 transactions will result in recording of an accrued expenditure
   unpaid (AEU) balance for the total amount of the 821.
   3.9.2. Processing 810 Transactions. After verifying that all 821 transactions have
   successfully processed in IAPS, a certifying official assigned to the FMA or ANG site will
   certify their consolidated invoice. Certification of the consolidated invoice results in the
   release of the 810 Certified Invoice transactions. The 810 transactions will be processed in
   first IAPS update after receipt. The 810 transactions are matched to the 821 transactions and
   the accrual is liquidated. The payment of 810 transactions is processed following ―Pay &
   Confirm‖ procedures. As a result the payment is scheduled on the earliest available payment
   date. The receipt confirmation is accomplished by the approving official approving their
   account. Note: All accepted transactions and those not corrected in the pre-edit process
   appear on the TQ-269 and TQ-164 Reports after the 3-day cycle is complete.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    37


                                           Chapter 4

                  USAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD

4.1. Authorized Use. The purchase card shall only be used for authorized U.S. government
purchases that are valid mission requirements. Some organizations have both appropriated and
non-appropriated funds available for use; separate cardholder accounts must be established to
segregate these fund types. Refer to AFI 65-601 V1, chapter 4 for funding guidance. All
cardholders and/or approving officials must contact their local comptroller and/or legal office if
any doubt exists regarding the proper use of appropriated funds.
   4.1.1. Micro-purchases. The GPC may be used to purchase the following:
       4.1.1.1. Authorized supplies and equipment up to the micro-purchase threshold of
       $3,000.
       4.1.1.2. Non-personal Services.
           4.1.1.2.1. Recurring services. Services performed at regular intervals having a
           demand that can be accurately predicted on an annual basis may be purchased with
           the GPC if they do not exceed $2,500 per fiscal year. Recurring services
           requirements estimated to exceed $2,500 per fiscal year shall be acquired through the
           servicing contracting office, except as authorized by paragraph 4.1.3.
           4.1.1.2.2. Non-recurring services. These services involve one-time, unpredictable, or
           occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up to $2,500 whenever
           a requirement occurs. If any doubt exists as to which category a service falls under,
           the cardholder shall consult with the local contracting office for a written
           determination.
       4.1.1.3. Construction up to $2,000. See paragraph 4.2.10 for additional limitations
       regarding the use of the GPC for construction.
       4.1.1.4. Purchases under the micro-purchase threshold are exempt from the Competition
       in Contracting Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act, Service Contract Act, and the
       Small Business Set-Aside Program.
   4.1.2. Payment Method. The GPC shall not be used as a method of contract payment for
   supplies/services unless GPC is used to order from prepriced vehicles such as Blanket
   Purchase Agreements, Federal Supply Schedules, or Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity
   contracts that do not exceed $25,000 or if a warranted Contracting Officer, up to the
   contracting officer's warrant limit (see FAR 13.301). All personnel must comply with the
   requirements of this instruction for establishing, funding, reconciling, and approving GPC
   purchases. Purchases for more than the micro-purchase threshold must also comply with all
   procurement and financial management laws and policies associated with the dollar value of
   the purchase. In addition, as a minimum, the following requirements must be met when the
   GPC is used as a payment method:
       4.1.2.1. The requirement must be reported by the cardholder to their local contracting
       program office to include type, size of business, and applicable competition requirements.
38                                                        AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     The local contracting office ensures this information is loaded into the FPDS-NG
     contracting tool.
     4.1.2.2. Sufficient funds must be committed and reserved to support the contract action.
     4.1.2.3. There must be a distinct separation of duties for purchase, acceptance, and
     payment for the contract action. No one individual may perform more than one of these
     functions.
     4.1.2.4. If a warranted Contracting Officer:
         4.1.2.4.1. The contract document must state that payment will be made by GPC and
         require authorization from the Contracting Officer to bill against the designated GPC
         account. The GPC account number shall not be included in the contract document.
         4.1.2.4.2. The Contracting Officer, in consultation with the local comptroller office,
         must comply with the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act, if applicable.
  4.1.3. Authorized Buys Over Micro-purchase Threshold by a Non-warranted Contracting
  Officer. If specifically authorized to make purchases above the micro-purchase threshold,
  cardholders not in contracting organizations may use the GPC only to obtain items from pre-
  priced government contracts and agreements (e.g., Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Blanket
  Purchase Agreements (BPA), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ID/IQ contracts etc.),
  except as specified in paragraphs 4.1.4, 4.1.5 and 4.1.10.1 Authority to use the GPC will not
  exceed $25,000 per transaction. Refer to 2.3.5.14 for additional instructions on BPA
  competition.
  4.1.4. Authorized Buys from Priority Sources. If authorized, cardholders may make
  purchases up to $25,000 per transaction from priority sources of supply such as the Federal
  Prison Industries, Ability One agencies and the stock programs of GSA and DLA. See FAR
  8.002(a)(1)(iii)-(v).
  4.1.5. DAPS. Air Force activities will use the GPC as a payment method to procure printing
  and high speed-high volume duplicating products and services from DAPS. Any such
  transactions are considered an intra-Governmental transaction and as such the micro-
  purchase threshold does not apply; however, a $100k single-purchase daily limit does apply.
  If transactions do not meet the DAPS criteria, as stated above (i.e., over the $100k single
  purchase daily limit) then activities will use other funding vehicles (DD Form 448, Military
  Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), or DD Form 282, DoD Printing
  Requisition/Order). In cases where DAPS cannot meet the Air Force printing and high
  speed-high volume duplicating services requirements, Air Force activities shall submit
  waiver requests IAW DoDI 5330.03 AFI33-395.
  4.1.6. OCONUS GPC Use. Overseas cardholders may be authorized to use the GPC to make
  commercial purchases up to $25,000 if the purchase is made outside the United States from
  vendors located outside the United States for use outside the United States, subject to the
  requirements specified in DFARS 213.301. If purchases are made from CONUS vendors for
  use overseas, the micro-purchase threshold remains in effect. For stateside purchases the
  cardholder must contact their local Traffic Management Flight for assistance regarding
  transportation and packaging requirements and/or instructions prior to contacting the vendor.
  Cardholders must ensure the final price includes all costs associated with the mode of
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   39


  transportation and packaging selected to the destination country; customs import duties, and
  any other charges that may accrue. Consult DoD 4500.54-G, Foreign Clearance Guide, prior
  to the requisitioning action to ensure compliance with host nation customs requirements.
  4.1.7. Support of Contingency/Exercise Operations.
     4.1.7.1. Warranted Contingency Contracting Officers (CCOs) are authorized to use the
     GPC in support of contingency/exercise operations. Home station GPCs may be issued
     to CCOs in advance to support planning for military operations or local emergencies
     IAW Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) Appendix CC.
     The commander/chief of the contracting office will balance contingency planning
     requirements with management control considerations when determining how many GPC
     holders are required in advance of deployment tasking. The approving official in each
     case will be the contracting squadron commander/chief of the contracting office or
     his/her designated representative. When tasked to deploy, the CCO will be issued a GPC
     by their home station for use during the deployment unless exempted by the supported
     command. When functional control of the deployed CCO shifts to another HCA, home
     station-issued GPCs may continue to be used unless prohibited by either the home station
     or the gaining command. GPCs may be issued to the CCO under the authority and
     direction of the supported command's HCA. In all cases the CCO will follow the
     guidance provided by the GPC-issuing office. When individuals participating in the
     operation or exercise are in temporary duty (TDY) status, they must document why they
     used the GPC in lieu of their Government travel card to pay for commercial lodging
     facility and meals.
     4.1.7.2. Cardholders who are not CCOs may continue to use unit-funded GPCs when
     deployed for a short duration (typically less than 30 days) exercise or contingency not-to-
     exceed the micro-purchase threshold authority per transaction. The approving official in
     this situation will not change. An example of this type of situation is a Red Horse
     organization deploying for a two-week period and then returning to their home station.
     Medical Dental Division (MDD) funded cards for which purchases will be reissued
     through an Air Force standard medical logistics automated information system may be
     used regardless of the duration of the deployment or exercise. In all cases, the cardholders
     and approving officials must ensure there are no delays in review and reconciliation of
     purchases made while the cardholder is deployed. In some cases, rules of engagement
     within the theater of operations may dictate that only warranted CCOs use the GPC.
     4.1.7.3. Except for purchases of hazardous materials (HAZMAT) (paragraph 4.2.1) and
     weapons systems parts (paragraph 4.2.9) the authorizations and coordination’s delineated
     in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 are not required for purchases made in support of
     contingency/exercise operations if the cardholder is not collocated with the authorizing
     official or coordinating office.
     4.1.7.4. Warranted CCOs may use the GPC as a payment method up to the limit of their
     warrant to cover written orders.
     4.1.7.5. If Internet capability is available at the deployed location, the cardholder will
     reconcile all transactions via the Bank’s electronic access system using normal
     procedures. If not, the cardholder will coordinate with the approving official and the
     approving official will reconcile all transactions on behalf of the cardholder.
40                                                        AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     4.1.7.6. When initiating cardholder set-up for a CCO who is not scheduled to deploy
     immediately, single purchase and monthly spending limits should be set at a low level;
     not less than $1. At the time the CCO is deployed, the limits can be raised by the A/OPC
     via the Bank’s electronic access system. The limits should be set realistically based on
     the expected purchase volume for that account. Upon the return of the CCO to his or her
     home base, the spending limits should be lowered to the previous level.
     4.1.7.7. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Deployments. All AEF eligible,
     military contracting personnel shall receive GPC training from their local contracting
     office. A copy of the training record shall be maintained in their unit deployment folder.
     Upon selection for an AEF tasking, designated CCOs will be notified, through their
     Personnel Readiness Unit, regarding unique GPC requirements, if any, for the operation
     or exercise they are tasked to support. In some cases, the CCO may be issued a GPC
     specific to the operation or exercise.
     4.1.7.8. Declared Contingency.
        4.1.7.8.1. DoD Guidance. All Program Managers, A/OPCs, Financial Managers,
        AOs/ COs and cardholders must comply with the policies listed in Appendix B, Using
        the Purchase Card for Contingency and Humanitarian Aid Operations, of the DoD
        Government Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase,
        Travel and Fuel Card Programs, 20 Jan 2006. A/OPCs will distribute DoD and AF
        guidance to all their GPC officials and cardholders.
        4.1.7.8.2. Increased Limits. All increases in the MPL or Simplified Acquisition
        Procedures (SAP) purchase limits for declared contingencies must be authorized by
        SAF/AQC. FAR 13.201 (g)(1)(i). A/OPCs and CHs must maintain a copy of this
        authorization. CHs must have also received appropriate training (see paragraph
        3.1.4.17) prior to making purchases at these higher limits.
        4.1.7.8.3. Warranted CCOs. CCOs may make open-market purchases up to
        $200,000 provided the purchase is made outside the United States, from a vendor
        located outside the United States, for use outside the United States and the GPC is
        used in the same manner as a SF Form 44 Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher (see
        DFARS 213.301.).
        4.1.7.8.4. Data Tracking. AOs shall ensure that all CH transactions (both below and

       each checking account under an approving official as part of the annual surveillance of
       accounts.
       4.4.1.6. Convenience checks shall not be issued for more than $3,000 per check and shall
       be issued for the exact payment amount. "Splitting" amounts across more than one check
       to keep below the micro-purchase limit is prohibited. The A/OPC shall suspend the
       account immediately for any assigned check writer who issues a check(s) exceeding the
       $3,000 limit. The A/OPC will notify the AO to pull the checkbook from the check
       writer. Surveillance will be conducted on the account by the A/OPC
       4.4.1.7. Convenience checks shall not be issued as an ―exchange-for-cash‖ vehicle to
       establish cash funds. If vendors issue credit checks or refunds by cash or check, funds

       validate all checks written are captured in the TD 1099 reporting tool as part of their
       surveillance report.
NOTE: All checks, not matter the dollar amount, must be captured and reported because
payments from several installations/agencies may total over $600 which is the IRS reporting
level for TD 1099 data. The information shall be reported to DFAS in accordance with
instructions issued by DFAS (see https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/systems/1099). The required

       prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Checks must be reconciled in the same manner
       as GPC transactions. Checks are printed on duplicate paper to facilitate tracking and
       reconciliation. Duplicate copies of checks must be retained as a part of the account
       holders’ original documentation files.
       4.4.1.13. The A/OPCs shall cancel the convenience check privileges of cardholders who
       misuse convenience checks more than once. Check writing privileges shall be
       permanently canceled for any flight or equivalent office in violation of policy more than
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  49


     twice in a 24 month period. Refresher training is required for any check writer who
     exceeds the $3000 check limit.
     4.4.1.14. Convenience checks cannot be used to reimburse students for tuition assistance.
     The appropriate method to reimburse students is SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for
     Expenditures on Official Business.
     4.4.1.15. Violations. Any violations of GPC procedures, including checking accounts
     will be documented by the A/OPC. If there is a compelling need for the account to
     remain open, the Appointing Authority may request the account be reopened if there is a
     compelling need for the account and another check writer cannot be appointed.
     Justifications, including disciplinary actions and procedures implemented to prevent
     recurrence to include the results of the account surveillance by the A/OPC and the dates
     that refresher training was taken, shall be submitted to the CONS/CC and be forwarded to
     the Level 3 reporting agent. Level 3 reporting agent must concur with the reinstatement
     prior to submittal to the Level 2 reporting agent.
  4.4.2. Authorization of Accounts.
     4.4.2.1. Approving official responsibilities for check accounts are the same as those for
     the GPC (see paragraph 2.3.4).
     4.4.2.2. Only the named person shall be designated as the convenience check writer and
     have the authority to sign and issue convenience checks. Check accounts shall be under
     the custody of an individual who is not responsible for the origination, approval and/or
     processing of the requirement for a check.
  4.4.3. Establishing Convenience Check Accounts. Requests to establish convenience check
  accounts shall be justified by the organization’s commander/director and forwarded to the
  A/OPC. A letter of appointment shall be provided to the activity approving official and
  check writer (by name) by the activity’s commander/director.
  4.4.4. Use of Convenience Check Accounts. Convenience check purchases are subject to the
  same requirements and restrictions as the GPC and shall not be used for any purpose where
  purchase using appropriated funds is not otherwise authorized.
  4.4.5. Disputes/Stop Payments.
     4.4.5.1. The disputes process available with the GPC is not available with convenience
     checks. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with
     the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing restitution and/or credit
     for disputed purchases. The check writer shall request A/OPC assistance to resolve
     disputes in the event he/she is unable to resolve disputes with the merchant. Each
     organization is responsible for checks written on the account, unless it is determined
     fraud is involved.
     4.4.5.2. In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been
     written if the check has not yet posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, call
     the Bank Customer Service to receive instructions on processing the action. The stop
     payment action will be in place for six months, and a fee will be charged (and must be
     accounted for on purchase log/funding document balance) directly to the account. If the
     check has already posted to the account, a request to stop payment cannot be honored.
 50                                                         AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


       4.4.5.3. Copies of posted checks are retained on file at the Bank for three and one half
       years. If a check copy is needed, it will be mailed within 14 calendar days of request. A
       fee will be charged (and must be accounted for on the purchase log/funding document
       balance) directly to the requesting account.
       4.4.5.4. Although a check is written, it may not immediately post, and therefore, may not
       be reflected in that month’s statement of account of the check writer. When a check is
       presented to the Bank for payment, there must be enough funds in the 30-day limit and
       office limit to cover the check. In addition, a check cannot exceed the single purchase
       limit assigned to the account. If a check presented exceeds any of the limits, the result
       may be a Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) situation and the check may be returned unpaid to
       the merchant or payee. A NSF fee will be assigned against the check writer’s account
       (and must be accounted for on the purchase log/funding document balance).
4.5. Unauthorized Use of the GPC. Intentional use of the purchase card for other than official
Government business will be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S.
Government and will result in immediate cancellation of an individual’s purchase card and
potential disciplinary action. In the absence of specific statutory authority, purchases of items
for the personal benefit of government employees, such as flowers, food, etc., is not permitted
and represents improper transactions. The use of the purchase card for personal purchases for
any reason is strictly prohibited.
   4.5.1. Cash advances. Money orders, traveler checks, and gift certificates are considered to
   be cash advances and shall not be purchased by cardholders to obtain items from merchants
   who do not accept the GPC (see paragraph 4.4).
       4.5.1.1. Travel or travel related expenses. This includes rental/lease of motor vehicles
       associated with travel or temporary duty supported by travel orders (purchase of airline,
       bus, and train tickets), purchase of meals, drinks, lodging, or other travel or subsistence
       costs associated with official Government travel that will be reimbursed on a travel
       voucher. Exception: If the travel and per diem ARE NOT reimbursed directly to the
       government traveler by travel voucher, for example, Reserve duty/exercise, air mobility
       aircrews at ports where the cost of the lodging and meals are a host unit expense, costs
       may be paid with host unit GPC. When an advanced conference fee is required, use of
       the GPC is preferred. Note: Subsistence items (not prepared meals) not associated with
       individual travel may be purchased with the GPC from the commissary or commercial
       sources. Before going to a commercial source it must be determined that troop issue
       (Prime Vendor) and the commissary cannot support the requirement. Prepared meals for
       dignitaries may only be purchased with Official Representational Funds (ORF). For
       purchases of prepared meals, the GPC can be used if a written determination is approved
       by the approving official that the official Government travel card cannot be used to
       satisfy the requirement. The original is to be retained in the cardholder’s file and a copy
       of the determination shall be forwarded to the A/OPC.
       4.5.1.2. Long-term rental or lease of land or buildings exceeding 30 days. Exception:
       Rental of temporary storage to facilitate office reconfiguration not to exceed 90 days
       provided the total price of rental does not exceed $3,000 and the rental period does not
       cross a fiscal year and subject to the written approval of the civil engineering real
       property officer.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   51


     4.5.1.3. Sales, rental and lease of vehicles and classified requirements or other
     requirements that require written contract terms and conditions.
     4.5.1.4. Purchase of Centrally Managed Fuel or Oil, i.e., Aviation, Diesel, Heating,
     Gasoline, Oil for Aircraft and Motorized Vehicles. Packaged oil and lubricants needed to
     support base maintenance shops, however, may be purchased using the GPC.
     4.5.1.5. Repair of GSA-Leased Vehicles.
     4.5.1.6. Purchase of Major Telecommunications Systems including                     Federal
     Telecommunications/ Telephone System 2000 or Defense Switched Network.
     4.5.1.7. Purchases of Hazardous/Dangerous Items such as Explosives, Munitions,
     Toxins, and Firearms. This specifically includes weapons, small arms, and ammunition.
     Exception: BASH Program, see paragraph 4.2.13
     4.5.1.8. Personal Services. Personal services contracts are contracts that, by its express
     terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, to be
     Government employees (e.g., consultants directly under Government supervision,
     temporary office help).
     4.5.1.9. Gifts (e.g., retirements, farewells).   These include food/beverages for
     organizational functions (commanders-call, picnics, parties, awards programs),
     promotional items for conferences, meetings, symposia (coins, mugs, coasters), and cash
     incentive awards. Likewise, rental of banquet halls or similar facilities for these
     functions is not authorized. Exceptions: U.S. flag for active duty military retirees
     (reference AFI 65-601V1, paragraph 4.54.).
     4.5.1.10. Entertainment.  Party supplies, serving material, food, and drinks are
     considered entertainment and are prohibited unless specifically authorized by law.
     Exceptions: AFI 65-601 V1, paragraph 4.28.1, 4.42.2., and 4.31.6.
     4.5.1.11. Purchases of Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI). The GPC shall not be
     used to purchase or repair secure telephone instruments or CCI assets. These must be
     requisitioned through the Logistics Readiness Squadron to ensure proper accountability
     records are established.
     4.5.1.12. Repair or procurement of Budget Code 8 depot-level repairable items. This
     includes depot/intermediate level repairable items.
     4.5.1.13. Safety-of-Flight items regardless of the Expendability, Repairability,
     Recoverability Category (ERRC).          Budget Code 8 XD Items.  This includes
     depot/organizational level repairable items.
     4.5.1.14. Utility Services. This includes electric, gas, water, phone, waste removal and
     cable TV services. These services are typically consolidated base-wide and purchased
     through contracts that generally exceed $3,000 a year. Exceptions: (1) Units physically
     isolated from the base either in an off-site location (e.g., Air Force recruiting office) or
     located in a remote portion of the base (often non-contiguous) so as to not be part of the
     base infrastructure (e.g., a building or an annex to the base which is connected to another
     municipality’s water supply). The GPC may be used to purchase utility services provided
     the dollar amount of each utility does not exceed $2,500 per year. (2) In locations where
     there is no base-wide service contract, individuals may pay their own cell phone bills
52                                                         AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     using the GPC if the annual bill does not exceed $2,500 and cardholders do not enter into
     agreements with cell phone companies that obligate the Government to pay cancellation
     fees if the service is discontinued. (3) Installations may use the GPC to pay cellular
     phone service only when using the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) established by
     the Air Force Information Technology Commodity Council for services not to exceed
     $25,000, either on an individual call basis or as an installation-wide call against the BPAs
     (see paragraph 4.1.3).
     4.5.1.15. Purchase requiring advance payments, except for subscriptions or training
     purchased on a SF 182, Request, Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and
     Reimbursement.
     4.5.1.16. Purchases from Government employees.
     4.5.1.17. Supplies for Contractors. The GPC will not normally be used to purchase
     supplies/services for contractors. If contracts require certain supplies/services to be
     provided by the Government, copies of the applicable sections of the contract(s) will be
     maintained as supporting documentation and the Contracting Officer will be required to
     approve the transaction(s).
     4.5.1.18. Items that are part of an existing contract (Examples include, but are not limited
     to: custodial contracts such as cleaning supplies or vacuum cleaners, lawn maintenance
     items such as lawn mowers, etc.) are prohibited. Contact your local civil engineering or
     contracting office for determination.
     4.5.1.19. Cash Refunds. Under no circumstances will the cardholder accept a cash
     refund for non-receipt of items, returned merchandise, or damaged items that were
     initially purchased using a government purchase card. The cardholder shall only accept
     credit to the account.
     4.5.1.20. Gift Checks, Rebates or Other Incentives. Under no circumstance will a
     cardholder retain gift checks, vendor rebates, or other purchase incentives that can be
     converted to their personal use. If received, these items must be turned over to the U.S.
     Treasury and documentation must be accomplished by the cardholder. Exception: When
     an incentive can be applied immediately, at the initial point of sale, thereby reducing the
     amount of the transaction.
     4.5.1.21. Split Requirements.        Cardholders shall not break down requirements
     aggregating more than the simplified acquisition threshold (or for commercial items, the
     threshold in subpart 13.5) or the micro-purchase threshold into several purchases that are
     less than the applicable threshold merely to avoid any requirement that applies to
     purchases exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. Splitting requirements in that manner
     is a prohibited use of the purchase card and may be violating statutory requirements for
     small business participation, competition, Service Contract Act, or Davis-Bacon Act.
     Urgency or expenditure of end-of-year funds does not relieve the cardholder or approving
     official of this prohibited practice. Purchases which would exceed the single-purchase
     limit must be forwarded through the proper channels to the contracting office for
     procurement.
     4.5.1.22. Repeat Buys. Cardholders are prohibited from making repeat buys of the same
     item to avoid the $3,000 limitation for purchasing and the $25,000 limitation for ordering
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                       53


       using the GPC. In addition, no purchase from the same vendor may exceed the single-
       purchase limit of $3,000 even if the individual items comprising the purchase have unit
       prices that are less than $3,000. The GPC was implemented to avoid the need for
       warehousing items and requisitioning items through the Supply system. This ―just-in-
       time‖ buying philosophy allows organizations the flexibility to buy items when they need
       them. However, there is no basis in regulation or law to permit cardholders to
       repetitively purchase an item when the cardholder knows or should have known of
       additional requirements for the same item that would result in an aggregate purchase
       greater than $3,000. There is a distinction between buying supplies and services based on
       one’s own needs known at the time and buying for one’s organization based on the
       known organizational requirement or forecast. The following two examples illustrate the
       distinction:
Example 1: On a Monday, a cardholder buys 10 widgets from one vendor totaling $2,400
because that is their known requirement. The next day, they learn that someone in their
organization needs another identical widget. As long as they made an honest effort to
consolidate their organization’s requirements when they made the first buy, they have not split
the requirement.

Example 2: A cardholder normally holds all requests until the end of the day/week/ month so
they will only have to make one buy. There is a steady, recurring requirement for a particular
item. After realizing that their request has exceeded $3,000, they decide to buy part of their
requirement one day and the remainder the next. This constitutes splitting a requirement because
it was known or should have been known that the total requirement with that merchant exceeded
$3,000. In cases such as these, a formal contract action must be initiated with the contracting
office. The key component is the knowledge of the total requirement with that merchant the
cardholder possessed at the time of purchase.

Business advice should be sought from the contracting squadron/office to decide the best
strategy for obtaining repetitive buy items and services. If a cardholder thinks their circumstance
may be viewed by reviewers as splitting a requirement, they should contact their A/OPC for
guidance. The cardholder should document the reason for any buy that may have the appearance
of a split requirement.
       4.5.1.23. Micro-purchase Made Not Using GPC. In cases where the card is not used to
       buy or pay for a micro-purchase, a written determination by a Senior Executive Service,
       flag or general officer is required prior to accomplishing the purchase action. This
       determination may be delegated no lower than the senior military or civilian official at
       the Activity. The written determination shall be included in the procurement file
       documentation providing proof of the propriety of the transaction. Exceptions to the
       written determination as stated in the Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum of 2 Oct
       1998 are shown in the Purchase Card Desk Guide.
       4.5.1.24. In addition to 4.5.1.1. through 4.5.1.24. above, all cardholders and approving
       officials shall comply with any and all MAJCOM and/or locally mandated restrictions.
       4.5.1.25. See AFI 65-601V1 and AFI 65-301 for more detailed guidance on authorized
       and unauthorized uses of appropriated funds. If in doubt, contact the local comptroller
       squadron/office.

   4.5.2. Recoup Unauthorized Expenditures. The local FMA shall take the lead to recoup
   funds which have been expended on unauthorized products or services identified by the GPC
   Program Office or other means of surveillance. The GPC Program Office will conduct the
   necessary audit oversight to identify possible improper purchases. Once found, the GPC
   Program Office would notify the cardholder, the approving official, and the responsible point
   of contact in the FMA of the finding and provide the pertinent information. The FMA
   activity would then review the purchase and regulatory guidance and make the final
   determination regarding any misuse of funds. When the review is complete, the FMA point
   of contact will notify the GPC Program Office of the determination. If the FMA confirms
   the purchase was improper, they would apply the appropriate remedy to recoup the funds,
   ensure the funds were returned to the correct billing account, and in turn provide the GPC
   Program Office with all pertinent information. The GPC Office would retain responsibility
   of addressing with the organizational commander, director or civilian equivalent, the need for
   any disciplinary action against the cardholder and/or approving official. The GPC office
   would, as deemed necessary, accomplish refresher training; make changes to account limits,
   close accounts, and document GPC files.
4.6. Foreign Drafts Accounts. Foreign Draft (FD) accounts provide an alternative only when
the use of the GPC or convenience check is not feasible. Foreign Drafts provide organizations
the flexibility to issue low volume, low foreign currency payments for supplies and services. If
an organization requires the Foreign Drafts they must coordinate approval through the A/OPC.
All Foreign Drafts issued will post against a specific cardholder/check writer account. Only
approved FD check writers with a valid FD Product User ID and Password have the authority to
create, print and issue a check. The management controls procedures and restrictions included in
this AFI for convenience checks also apply to Foreign Drafts. A 2% fee is charged on Foreign
Drafts.

                    SURVEILLANCE AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

5.1. Surveillance
   5.1.1. GPC Surveillance Requirements.
       5.1.1.1. In order to standardize the evaluation of the purchase card program results, use
       of the Surveillance Checklist, including both ―Review of Approving Official Accounts‖
       and ―Review of Cardholder/Check writer Accounts‖, is mandatory. The Surveillance
       Checklist is attached to this Instruction as Attachment 5. This checklist may be
       supplemented at command and/or local levels.
       5.1.1.2. Reports on surveillance results shall include an assessment of program control
       including, at a minimum, the ratio of cardholders to employees (this is an installation
       level statistic), ratio of approving officials to cardholders, ratio of monthly credit limits to
       actual spending on cardholder accounts, and number of cardholders and approving
       officials requiring refresher training. Reserve bases may count weekend reservists in
       their employee count for their bases. Surveillance results shall be maintained on file in
       the A/OPC office. Copies of surveillance results shall be provided to the approving
       official’s organizational commander, director or civilian equivalent, the approving
       official, and, if applicable, the cardholder. Purchase card program management and
       administrative records generated by installation program coordinators and approving
       officials, such as records of cardholder and approving official appointments and training,
       cardholder delegations of authority, and purchase card surveillances, shall be retained per
       the AF Records Disposition Schedule (see paragraph 3.6.15).
       5.1.1.3. Commanders or civilian equivalents should include the GPC program in their
       management control program checklists and ensure that suspected misuse and abuse of
       the purchase card is appropriately investigated.
       5.1.1.4. If as a result of surveillance, or any other means, the A/OPC, approving official,
       or cardholder suspect a GPC account number has been compromised, the cardholder’s
       account shall immediately be cancelled and a new account established. Likewise, if a
       cardholder is approached by a vendor suggesting any type of illegal or unethical business
       arrangement, cardholder should immediately report this contact to the A/OPC. The
       A/OPC shall immediately notify the local Office of Special Investigations or others as
       deemed appropriate.
       5.1.1.5. Quarterly, the AF GPC Violations Report shall be completed for review by
       SAF/AQ. The report quantifies violations and corrective actions. It will be submitted
       through the MAJCOM Level 3 to the AF Level 2, GPC Program Manager. This report is
       submitted one quarter in arrears and use of the prescribed template is required (see AF
       Contracting Central section of the SAF/AQC Homepage on the AF Portal at
       https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/pages/default.aspx).
   5.1.2. Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC).
       5.1.2.1. At least once every 12 months (not once per fiscal year), the A/OPC shall
       perform physical surveillance on each managing account, as well as a random sample of
56                                                          AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     25% of cardholders assigned to each managing account. Results of surveillance reviews,
     including corrective/disciplinary action taken shall be documented and retained on file.
     5.1.2.2. Annual surveillance reports shall be signed by the installation Contracting
     Squadron Commander, director or civilian equivalent and shall be addressed to the unit
     commander or civilian equivalent with copies being sent to the AO’s supervisor.
     5.1.2.3. Annual surveillance reports shall include recommendations for unit commander
     or equivalent where approving officials and/or cardholders have failed to follow
     appropriate policies and procedures.
     5.1.2.4. The A/OPC, when necessary, shall meet with the approving official to discuss
     each finding of noncompliance.
     5.1.2.5. The A/OPC shall track and monitor corrective actions identified on the annual
     surveillance reports and provide quarterly status reports to their installation Contracting
     Squadron Commander, director or equivalent. Pending the corrective actions (training,
     account suspension, etc.) the A/OPC must ensure spending limits are set to $1.
     5.1.2.6. The A/OPC, in addition to the automatic Data Mining/Risk Assessment
     (DM/RA) reviews from PCOLS, shall use transactional reports from the Bank’s EAS (or
     other electronic oversight process) to perform the following Level IV reviews:
        5.1.2.6.1. 100% of transactions over the micro-purchase level for compliance.
        5.1.2.6.2. 100% review for tax exemption compliance.
        5.1.2.6.3. All transactions for ―unusual merchants‖ and ―unusual‖ purchase activity
        as well as possible coordination compliance.
        5.1.2.6.4. Potential split purchase report, particularly at the end of the fiscal year.
        5.1.2.6.5. Account certification report to ensure AOs are working the cycle timely as
        well as FMA certification.
        5.1.2.6.6. Records of the reports and the subsequent review would be kept in the
        audit records maintained by the GPC Program Office as supporting documentation
        for program surveillance.
     5.1.2.7. Components shall take the necessary steps to ensure A/OPCs are notified of
     personnel changes that would warrant cancellation of charge card authorization. A/OPCs
     should also use the EAS reports to determine what accounts have not been used for the
     last six months with the goal to close accts that will no longer be used.
     5.1.2.8. Violation of Air Force GPC procedures. If a GPC violation is discovered, the
     A/OPC shall document the violation and take action to resolve the noncompliance to
     include, if necessary, retraining of the cardholder or approving official and/or temporarily
     suspending the cardholder or approving official’s GPC privileges. Any determinations to
     cancel or permanently suspend a cardholder or approving official account shall be made
     by the Contracting Squadron commander, director or equivalent, in writing, and their
     findings forwarded to the cardholder’s and/or approving official’s unit commander or

 58                                                          AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


       5.1.3.2. AOs shall perform surveillance reviews of 100% of their cardholder accounts at

       5.1.3.4. The AO shall actively inspect newly appointed cardholders during the first three
       months to ensure they are effectively performing their duties and following all
       procedures. Copies of surveillance results for new cardholders shall be provided to the
       A/OPC to assist them in providing tailored training for new cardholders.
       5.1.3.5. AOs shall perform surveillance of GPC purchases made during all
       contingency/exercise operations within 30 days following the conclusion of the
       contingency/exercise, deployment of the cardholder, or the receipt of the final statement,
       whichever is later.
5.2. Disciplinary Actions. GPC misuse, abuse, and payment delinquency will not be tolerated.
The GPC card is for official government use and it is the Air Force’s policy that improper,
fraudulent, abusive, or negligent use of a government purchase card is prohibited. Each agency
shall formalize local policies and procedures identifying the formal and informal disciplinary
actions and/or corrective measures that will be levied by the Command as a result of reviews
revealing non-compliance with policies or procedures, fraud, misuse and/or abuse by program
participants, i.e., A/OPCs, AOs, purchase cardholders, including supervisors/managers. All
disciplinary actions taken or corrective measures implemented shall be documented.
   5.2.1. Policy. It is DoD policy that in each case of improper, fraudulent, abusive, or
   negligent use of the purchase card by civilian personnel or military personnel, including any
   use at establishments or for purposes that are inconsistent with official business or with
   applicable regulations, the supervisor of the responsible individual or parties will be
   informed in a timely manner in order that appropriate corrective, disciplinary or adverse
   action may be taken. Supervisors who receive information indicating that a civilian or
   military employee has engaged in any fraud, misuse or abuse of a purchase card, shall take
   appropriate corrective or disciplinary/adverse action, including further investigation if
   needed.
The intent of this policy is to ensure that management emphasis is given to the important issue of
personal accountability for purchase card fraud, misuse and abuse. There is no intent to deprive
managers and supervisors of their discretion in handling purchase card misuse in a manner
appropriate to each individual case. The circumstances of each individual case will determine
the appropriate type of disciplinary/adverse action, if any, that may be imposed. A progression
of increasingly severe penalties is often appropriate in the case of minor instances of misuse, but
more serious cases may warrant the most severe penalty for the first offense if abuse or
fraudulent activity is prevalent. Clearly there is no single response appropriate for all cases.
While the merits of each case may vary, timeliness, proportionality, and the exercise of good
judgment and common sense are always important. Where applicable, full consideration must be
given to the relevant ―Douglas Factors‖ as provided in Douglas v. Veteran’s Administration, 5
MSPB 313 (1981).
   5.2.2. Guidance.
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    59


     5.2.2.1. Personnel. Civilian personnel penalty guidelines shall address offenses with
     respect to government purchase cards and shall indicate that the penalty of removal from
     government service is an available maximum option for a first offense in appropriate
     cases, as determined by the deciding official. In taking corrective or disciplinary action
     against civilian personnel, supervisors shall use the ―Civilian Human Resources Manual
     Sub-Chapter 752‖ as authoritative guidance. Purchase card offense(s) may be framed in
     any lawful manner. The servicing Human Resources Office should assist the supervisor
     in taking disciplinary/adverse action on the selection of the charge and appropriate
     penalty based on the Air Force’s past practice, regulatory guidance, applicable case law
     and good judgment of the supervisor taking the disciplinary or adverse action.
     Coordination with the appropriate legal office should occur early in the process.
     5.2.2.2. Military Personnel. Military personnel who misuse, abuse or commit fraud with
     the purchase card shall be subject to actions available under reference (l), including
     counseling, admonishment, reprimand, nonjudicial punishment (Article 15, Uniform
     Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)), court-martial, and administrative separation. In
     appropriate cases, pecuniary liability, referral for criminal prosecution in civilian courts,
     and civil enforcement action are other ways to hold military personnel personally
     accountable for charge card misuse. In taking corrective or disciplinary action against
     military personnel who misuse or abuse the government purchase cards, commanders or
     supervisors shall use the procedures established for each action by the appropriate
     Military Department and consult with their legal advisors as necessary. In addition to
     corrective or disciplinary action, military personnel who misuse their government
     purchase card may have their access to classified information modified or revoked if
     warranted in the interest of national security. Commanders and supervisors shall follow
     previously issued guidance to ensure that security clearance reviews are conducted when
     the holder of a government purchase card comes under investigation for card misuse.

                                           Attachment 2
  CERTIYING OFFICER AND ACCOUNTABLE OFFICIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
                 THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD

A2.1. Background. DoD policy requires the appointment of Certifying Officers in accordance
with Title 31, United States Code, section 3325. Certifying Officers have pecuniary liability for
erroneous payments resulting from performance of their duties in accordance with Title 31,
United States Code, Section 3328. Further, it is DoD policy that other officials involved in
authorizing payments are accountable, and that these Accountable Officials are accountable for
erroneous payments resulting from negligent performance of their responsibilities. DoD
guidance is provided in DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 5, Chapter 33.
a. Certifying Officers. Certifying officers are responsible for certifying that payment vouchers
are correct and proper for payment.

b. Accountable Officials. Approving officials and cardholders are designated as accountable
officials and must attest to the accuracy of information and data provided to the Certifying
Officer in support of the payment to the Bank. If identified by the installation commander or
activity director, other personnel may also be designated as accountable officials. See paragraph
2.b.(3) below.
A2.2. Responsibilities and Certification Statements. a. Purchase Card Certifying Officers.
Each Air Force Financial Management Analyst (FMA) that is not a Deputy Disbursing officer
(DDO) will appoint the Certifying Officer, and an alternate, for certifying payments to the
paying office (disbursing officer) for installation invoices/billing statements. In those cases
where the FMA is the DDO, the Installation Comptroller will make the appointments. The
Certifying Officer is responsible for the accuracy of payments, including the proper citing of
appropriations or other funds, certified to the paying office and disbursing officer. Certifying
Officers are liable for any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment processed by the Air Force
Department as a result of any inaccurate or misleading certification. A Certifying Officer will not
approve as proper for payment any charges which were known to be fraudulent or known to be
made by an unauthorized cardholder. Suspected improper payments should be reported
immediately; however, payment should still be made to the financial institution. Since payments
are to the financial institution, the certifying officer is responsible for certifying the legality and
accuracy of the information pertaining to the amount owed the financial institution, not for the
total propriety of all the purchases made for the billing period. Every purchase made by an
authorized cardholder using an authorized card creates a legal obligation of the government, even
if it is in violation of public law or if it exceeds fund availability. In the event an approving
official authorizes a purchase or a cardholder exceeds his/her limit, the invoice must be paid and
sufficient funds must be obtained from the responsible fund holder.
(1) A Certifying Officer may be relieved from liability if the certification was based on
official records and the officer did not know, and by reasonable diligence and inquiry, could not
have discovered the correct information. For example, if a cardholder loses the card and fails to
make the required notification, and unauthorized purchases are made, the Certifying Officer may
be relieved from liability. Also, liability will not be assessed, in most cases, when (1) the
obligation was incurred in good faith, (2) no law specifically prohibited the payment; and (3) the
United States Government received value for payment.
 68                                                             AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011



(2) Certification of the invoice must be accomplished in accordance with ―pay and confirm‖
procedures. Guidance for the ―pay and confirm‖ policy is contained in DoD Purchase Card
Reengineering Implementation Memo #3, Streamlined Financial Management Procedures. The
memo states ―…the Department and its Components shall implement a ―pay and confirm‖
process whereby payment of invoices will be made promptly subject to follow-on verification of
receipt and acceptance of goods.‖

(3) The Financial Services Office is the designated billing office for each installation. The
Certifying Officer, upon verification of funding, shall certify the invoice for payment and
forward it electronically to the designated payment office. As identified in the DoD Purchase
Card Reengineering Implementation Memo #1, use the following format for the Certifying
Officer statement.

Figure A2.1. Certifying Officer Statement

Certifying Officer Statement                            Date: _____________


Pursuant to the authority vested in me, I certify that this invoice (billing statement) is correct and
proper for payment, except as may be noted herein or on supporting documents.



       ________________________________
       Authorized Certifying Officer Signature
       (or electronic signature)


(4) The official installation GPC invoice is available, on-line, via the Bank’s electronic
access system. Starting on the second day after the end of the billing cycle, usually the 21st of
the month, the Certifying Officer must verify that the amount of funding, by managing account,
is sufficient to cover the total amount of the invoice. An increase to obligation amount must be
posted if sufficient funds are not available. Not later than 7 days after the end of the billing cycle,
the Certifying Officer must certify the invoice for payment on the ―pay and confirm‖ basis.

(5) Certifying Officer must ensure confirmation procedures and controls are effectively in
place. Prior to certifying the current month’s invoice, either (1) all confirmation statements from
the prior month’s invoice must be received within 30 days or (2) notice by the A/OPC must be
received that the cards with missing confirmation statements have been suspended or cancelled.
(a) If approving official accounts are not reconciled and approved before the next billing
cycle, the Financial Management Analyst (FMA) must take documented follow-up actions. The
FMA must run a report via the Bank’s electronic access system that lists all approving official
accounts that have not been reconciled and approved since the close of the billing cycle. The
FMA must notify the A/OPC in writing with the report as an attachment identifying which
AFI64-117 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                      69


approving officials have not complied. The A/OPC will reduce the approving officials’ monthly
limits to $1, pending approval.

(b) When approving officials have indicated exceptions (other than questioned items or
disputes) to the statements, appropriate and timely corrective actions must be taken.

(c) In accordance with AFI 64-117, paragraph 4.3.3.4., the A/OPC and the FMA should be
notified immediately by any official or individual suspecting improper purchases.

b. Purchase Card Accountable Officials. Accountable Officials are accountable for erroneous
payments that result from inaccurate information and data, including designation of the proper
appropriations provided to the Certifying Officer, if the erroneous payment is the result of
negligence relative to performance of assigned duties.

(1) Approving officials, and alternates, are designated as accountable officials. Each
month, the approving official will review and approve, via the Bank’s electronic access system,
each of their cardholder’s statements of account. The approving official is responsible for
ensuring that established dollar amounts are not exceeded and all transactions are appropriate,
given the duties of the cardholders and the mission of the unit. As an accountable official the
approving official, via the Bank’s electronic access system or by hand, must execute the

         SAMPLE DELEGATION OF CONTRACTING AUTHORITY LETTER

MEMORANDUM FOR (Cardholder’s Name and Title)

FROM: (Name and Title of HCA designee)

SUBJECT: Delegation of Contracting Authority for Government Purchase Card Use

You have successfully completed the mandatory Government Purchase Card training program.
You are, therefore, authorized to obtain supplies and non-personal services and to pay for them
using the Government-wide Purchase Card. Any single purchase delegation shall not exceed the
authorized delegation limits assigned herein ($2.5K for services, $2K for construction, $3K for
goods, etc.) and spending cannot exceed aggregate available balance of AF4009 and available
credits on management account/cardholder account.

The supplies and non-personal services you obtain with the purchase card must be for official
Government requirements and be consistent with your assigned responsibilities and your card
purchase limits, including commodity restrictions, set by your approving official. This
authorization does not exempt you from the requirement to obtain certain supplies from required
sources of supply listed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8, or from other
organizations which have been given exclusive contracting authority for that commodity or
service.

All purchases using the purchase card shall comply with applicable laws and regulations,
including but not limited to the FAR and AFI 64-117. If you purchase such supplies or services,
you shall be subject to fines and adverse disciplinary action for misusing the purchase card.

Your approving official will periodically review your use of the purchase card. He/she may
determine that you no longer need to use the card and cancel it. He/she may also confiscate your
card or, in less severe cases, reduce your monthly purchase limit to $1.00 until such a time that
satisfactory remedial training has been accomplished. The types of violations which may result
in cancellation or suspension of the account include but are not limited to: allowing someone else
to use your card; failing to perform timely reconciliation; or failing to resolve disputed charges.

When you separate from (insert name of activity), through dismissal, retirement, transfer, or for
any other reason, this delegation is automatically terminated and the purchase card must be
returned to your approving official for destruction.

                                GPC SURVEILLANCE GUIDE

Surveillance is one of the cornerstones of a strong, viable GPC Program. It is imperative that an
impartial review of accounts is conducted to ensure appropriated funds are being used correctly
for valid organization requirements. As an aid to your surveillance reviews, questions such as

use of the GPC. This is not an all-inclusive guide. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs or local installations
may supplement this guide as needed. This information (along with local supplemental
questions) may be incorporated as an Air Force form by overlaying the information onto an AF
Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, as an OVERPRINT.
