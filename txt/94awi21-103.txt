Inadvertently released munitions or munitions released in excess of the quantity selected by the
 2                                                            94AWI21-103 25 OCTOBER 2012


aircrew, or a multiple release, are not considered dropped objects and will be reported IAW AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The MXG and OG Commanders have established this program to focus on preventing
     in-flight loss of objects.
     2.2. The MXG Quality Assurance Activity (MXG/MXQ) is designated Program Manager
     and investigating office.
     2.3. The responsible work center will gather all required information as listed in AFI 21-101,
     Section 14.11 and forward it to the MOC and QA so that the DOPP report can be completed
     and forwarded out to the appropriate agencies within the required 72-hour period.
3. Prevention. Effective prevention begins with supervisors ensuring maintenance personnel
are properly trained in their AFSC of responsibility. Additionally, all maintenance personnel
must be knowledgeable of command and unit requirements to prevent dropped objects from
occurring.
     3.1. Dropped Object Prevention starts with proper AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
     Discrepancy and Work Document, and AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status
     and Maintenance, documentation prior to removal and after installation of an aircraft
     component, cowling, door, panel, or part. Document aircraft forms in accordance with T.O.
     00-20-1, and unit instructions.
     3.2. Personnel must ensure doors, cowlings, and panels fit properly, place special emphasis
     on the condition and serviceability of all fasteners, nut plates, and latching devices, as they
     are prime contributors to dropped objects.
     3.3. Special attention must be given to “Last Minute” maintenance actions.
     3.4. A second look DOPP inspection annotated as, “Prior to flight DOPP inspection
     required” will be accomplished prior to each flight IAW AFI 21-101_AFRC Sup 1 and
     LWC-94MXG-10-11.
4. Investigation: MXG, Quality Assurance Office will:
     4.1. Investigate each dropped object thoroughly, as soon as the loss is discovered/reported.
     Every effort must be taken to determine the precise cause of the loss so permanent corrective
     action can be taken.
     4.2. Where material failure or design deficiency is the cause, MXG/MXQ will ensure
     Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDR) are submitted according to T.O. 00-35D-54
     with information copies to the MAJCOM and NAF/A4M.
     4.3. MXG/MXQ will ensure dropped objects resulting from maintenance or operations
     malpractice are referred to the applicable MXG/OG Commander for action.
     4.4. The Quality Assurance office will ensure Dropped Object incidents are included in the
     MXQ Monthly and Quarterly Summaries.
     4.5. MXG/MXQ will analyze incidents for unit trends and ensure corrective actions are valid
     and complete.
