                                           Chapter 1

              PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND OTHER COMPLIANCE AREAS

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides guidance and procedures for the AF Deployment Health
program, primarily focusing on the DRHA Program. The purpose of the DRHA Program is to
identify and to address Service members’ and civilians’ health care needs related to deployment.
DRHAs assist with the early identification and management of deployment-related health
concerns and conditions that may surface in the months before or the months to years after
deployment. As such, DRHAs are a vital component of the Air Force’s ability to provide
effective care and treatment for members with deployment-related health concerns. The
information provided in DRHAs may result in a referral for additional health care that may
include medical, dental, or behavioral health care or diverse community support services.
1.2. Overview. Deployment medical requirements span the pre- and post-deployment cycle and
include various requirements, which may vary based on the deployer’s component (e.g., RegAF,
ARC, DAF, or contractor). Note: Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) will not process
contractors for deployment, unless the deploying individual’s contract specifically states that
medical services must be provided. If the contract obligates the MTF to provide services,
expenses related to providing contractually required deployment-related medical clearance
services to the deploying contractor should be applied (via journal voucher) to the
organization/contingency that funded the contract. A copy of the contract containing exact
medical specifications must be provided to the Public Health/Force Health Management
(PH/FHM) Office prior to initiation of any medical clearance activities or services IAW DoDI
3020.41. (T-0).
1.3. Compliance Areas.
     1.3.1. DoDI 6490.03 and DoDI 6490.07 require all deploying personnel to undergo a
     mandatory medical assessment prior to deployment. Components of the assessment include:
     Completion of DD Form 2795, Pre-Deployment Health Assessment; DD Form 2766, Adult
     Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet; medical record review; review of Individual
     Medical Readiness (IMR) status; assessment of any profiles for impact on deployability; and
     review of current preventive health assessment (PHA) (RegAF and ARC members only) or
     physical exam within 1 year of deployment (DAF Civilians only). (T-0). Note: The civilian
     physical exam will be documented on the OF-178, Certificate of Medical Examination form.
     1.3.2. Pre-deployment medical requirements are identified in DoD, Combatant Command
     (CCMD) Reporting Instructions and AF guidance.
        1.3.2.1. Comprehensive medical clearance information for all deployers is located on the
        Deployment        Health       KJ        on       the        AFMS           Kx        at
        https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/DeploymentHealth/Pages/home.aspx.
        1.3.2.2. DAF Civilian-specific deployment health guidance is available on the
        DoD/General       Schedule       (GS)    Civilian    personnel     page      at
        https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/DeploymentHealth/Pages/DoDGSCivilianPersonnel.aspx
        .
AFI48-122 18 AUGUST 2014                                                                    5


  1.3.3. DoDI 6490.03, requires deploying personnel to complete three (3) DRHAs: DD Forms
  2795, Pre-Deployment Health Assessment, 2796, Post-Deployment Health Assessment
  (PDHA), and 2900, Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA). Additionally, DoDI
  6490.12, mandates personnel complete two (2) additional deployment mental health
  assessments (MHAs) as part of DoD DRHA requirements and for them to be documented on
  DD Form 2978, Deployment Mental Health Assessment. (T-0). As a result, DoD requires a
  total of five (5) DRHAs.
     1.3.3.1. DRHA #1 – DD Form 2795 (includes the pre-deployment MHA). (T-0).
     1.3.3.2. DRHA #2 – DD Form 2796 (PDHA). (T-0).
     1.3.3.3. DRHA #3 – DD Form 2900 (PDHRA-includes the first post-deployment MHA).
     (T-0).
     1.3.3.4. DRHA #4 – DD Form 2978 (does not apply to DAF Civilians). (T-0).
     1.3.3.5. DRHA #5 – DD Form 2978 (does not apply to DAF Civilians). (T-0).
  1.3.4. DRHAs are required for individuals deploying on contingency, exercise, deployment
  (CED) orders for greater than 30 days to OCONUS locations with medical support from only
  non-fixed (temporary) medical facilities. Completion of DRHAs for (1) OCONUS
  deployments <30 Days, (2) OCONUS deployments to areas with fixed U.S. MTFs, or (3)
  CONUS deployments may be required at the commander’s discretion (CCMD, Service
  component commanders, or commanders exercising operational control) based on the health
  threats identified during the deployment (as described in DoDI 6490.03). (T-0). Note: All
  DRHA requirements are specified in the reporting instructions for the particular deployed
  location found at https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFRIT/Afrit.aspx.
  1.3.5. DRHA completion is defined as: (1) deployer completion of the automated DRHA
  questionnaire in the designated information system (e.g. Aeromedical Services Information
  Management System Web Application [ASIMS]) and (2) a face-to-face encounter (person-
  to-person for Air Reserve Component [ARC] with the exception of DRHA #1 and #2 which
  must be completed face-to-face) with a DRHA trained health care provider in a private
  setting to foster trust and openness in discussing sensitive health concerns.
     1.3.5.1. DRHA findings – identified as Critical, Priority, Routine, Negative, and
     Incomplete – are tracked in the ASIMS application and must be reviewed and closed by a
     credentialed, trained health care provider within the appointment priority timeframes
     specified in paragraph 3.3. Note: MTF is defined in this document as a Military
     Treatment Facility for RegAF and Category B/E Individual Mobilization Augmentee
     (IMA) personnel, a Guard Medical Unit (GMU) for ANG members, and a Reserve
     Medical Unit (RMU) for AFR members.
     1.3.5.2. ARC members have three (3) options for completing person-to-person
     encounters: (1) through the Reserve Health Readiness Program (RHRP)-contracted call
     center with a credentialed, trained health care provider (for DRHAs #3, #4, #5 only), (2)
     through a MTF with a credentialed, trained health care provider, or (3) with a
     credentialed, trained ARC health care provider. The ARC DRHA Program Guides
     provide instructions for ARC DRHA processes. Guides are available on the Deployment
6                                                             AFI48-122 18 AUGUST 2014

    1.3.5.3. ARC members are eligible to complete deployment health and medical
    requirements through TRICARE or at RegAF locations for Title 10 deployments for > 31
    days. Eligibility begins 180 days prior to deployment once enrollment eligibility has been
    established in Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) by the tasked

      3.1.1.4. DRHA #4 - Between 181 days and 545 days after return from deployment. (T-
      0).
      3.1.1.5. DRHA #5 - Between 546 days and 910 days after return from deployment. (T-
      0).
      3.1.1.6. IAW DoDI 6490.12, if an individual begins pre-deployment processing again
      before completing any of the three required post-deployment mental health assessments
      and, as part of that process, completes a pre-deployment mental health assessment, the
      individual’s deployment mental health assessment cycle will be reset and the requirement
      to complete the post- deployment mental health assessments will be considered satisfied.
3.2. DRHA Readiness Activities. DRHAs will be incorporated into the following readiness
and deployment health activities:
   3.2.1. DRHA #1 will be accomplished with pre-deployment medical out-processing; all
   personnel (RegAF, ARC, and DAF Civilians) must report to PH/FHM section to initiate pre-
   deployment medical out-processing activities IAW DoD, Air Force, and CCMD Reporting
   Instructions. (T-0). Note: ARC personnel will perform medical out-processing through their
   respective RMUs/GMUs for traditional Reserve or Guardsmen. IMAs will process through
   their MTF unit of attachment. RMUs/GMUs may enter into agreements for support from an
   RegAF MTF, where appropriate; however, the RMU/GMU will retain overall responsibility
   for medical out-processing and tracking of all deployment-related health requirements. ANG
   MDG providers will review responses with the member to determine deployability. (T-1).
   3.2.2. DRHA #2 will be accomplished with pre-reintegration actions and medical out-
   processing from theater; all personnel (RegAF, ARC, and DAF Civilians) will report to the

   3.2.4. DRHAs #4 and #5 (not required for DAF Civilians) will be accomplished with the
   annual PHA. (T-0). Note: If DRHA #4 or #5 does not coincide with the member’s annual
   PHA, the assessment will be completed separately to ensure it occurs within the required
   time frame. (T-0).
3.3. Scheduling the DRHA Appointment.
   3.3.1. All patients on the Open DRHA List in ASIMS require a face-to-face (person-to-
   person for ARC personnel completing DRHAs #3, #4, and #5) assessment with a trained
   health care provider. The required timeline for patient contact and appointments is dictated
   by Critical, Priority, Routine, Negative, and Incomplete findings on the DRHA (see below).
   (T-1). Note: Reference the RegAF, AFR, and ANG DRHA Program Guides on the
   Deployment               Health             KJ,           AFMS             Kx              at
   https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/DeploymentHealth/Pages/home.aspx for specific guidance on
   roles and responsibilities.
      3.3.1.1. Critical findings – A health care provider certified to perform DRHAs or a
      Registered Nurse must contact deploying personnel within one (1) duty day to assess the
      need for immediate intervention or urgent care; the face-to-face encounter must be
      conducted within three (3) duty days. (T-1).
      3.3.1.2. Priority and Incomplete findings – A trained health care provider must conduct
      the face-to-face encounter within seven (7) calendar days. (T-1).
      3.3.1.3. Routine or Negative findings – A trained health care provider must conduct the
      face-to-face encounter within thirty (30) calendar days. (T-1).
3.4. DRHA Completion Requirements.
   3.4.1. All deploying personnel (to include other Armed Forces Service members empanelled
   to Joint Base MTFs where the AF is the lead agent for medical services) will complete
   DRHAs online via ASIMS unless otherwise directed by local joint base Memorandum of
   Agreement (MOA). (T-0). Note: During a short-notice contingency operation, in the
   absence of ASIMS, hard copy and/or hand-written DRHAs may be accepted; however,
   DRHA hand-written forms must be manually transcribed immediately into ASIMS. (T-0).
   3.4.2. DRHA forms (DD Forms 2795, 2796, 2900, and 2798) are expressly prohibited from
   use during exercise scenarios not involving real-world taskings or official issuance of
   contingency orders. (T-1).
   3.4.3. A legible copy of DRHAs #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 must be documented in the
   deployer’s EHR, if the capability exists. Otherwise, a hard copy must be filed in the
   outpatient medical record. Specific instructions for ASIMS/AHLTA documentation is
   available in the DRHA Program Guide on the Deployment Health KJ on the AFMS Kx at

Terms
Accountable Forms—Forms that the Air Force stringently controls and which cannot be
released to unauthorized personnel, since their misuse could jeopardize DoD security or result in
fraudulent financial gain or claims against the government.
Administrative Change—Change that does not affect the subject matter content, authority,
purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication (e.g., changing the POC name,
office symbol(s), correcting misspellings, etc.)
Approval Authority—Senior leader responsible for contributing to and implementing policies
and guidance/procedures pertaining to his/her functional area(s) (e.g., heads of functional two-
letter offices).
Air Force Reserve Component—The USAF Air Reserve Component consists of the AFR and
ANG. AFRC stood up as a MAJCOM February 17, 1997. The change in status, authorized by
Congress in the Fiscal 1997 National Defense Authorization Act, was based on the experience
gained from the AFR mobilization for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
Authentication—Required element to verify approval of the publication; the approval official
applies his/her signature block to authenticate the publication. The signature block includes the
official’s name, rank, and title (not signature).
Contingency—A situation requiring military operations in response to natural disasters,
terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by appropriate authority to protect US interests.
Contingency Deployment—A deployment that is limited to outside the continental United
States, over 30 days in duration and in a location with medical support from only non-fixed
(temporary) military MTFs. It is a deployment in which the relocation of forces and material is to
an operational area in which a contingency is or may be occurring.
Deployment— The relocation of forces and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment
encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including
inter-continental United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater movement legs, staging, and
holding areas.
Geographically Separated Units—Any unit separated from its servicing military personnel
flight beyond a reasonable commuting distance. For ANG units, the term GSU is used
synonymous with Independent Unit (IU).
Individual Medical Readiness—A means to assess an individual Service member’s, or larger
cohort’s, readiness level against established metrics applied to key elements of health and fitness
to determine medical deployability in support of contingency operations.
Medical Assessment—The total of the pre-deployment activities described in Attachment 1 of
Enclosure 2 of DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health.
Medical Treatment Facility—A facility established for the purpose of furnishing medical
and/or dental care to eligible individuals. Also called MTF. (JP 1-02. SOURCE: JP 4-02)
Person–to–Person DRHA—Face-to-face, by telephone, or video teleconference.
Post-Deployment Health Assessment—The PDHA process and screener (DD Form 2796,
DRHA#2) are conducted within 30 days prior to departure from theater or within 30 days after
AFI48-122 18 AUGUST 2014                                                                       23


return from theater. The DD Form 2796 is required if a DD Form 2795 was required during the
pre-deployment phase and is directed at the individual’s health status and concerns at
redeployment- the screening is also used to document health events and enhance future force
health.
Post-Deployment Health Reassessment—The PDHRA process and screener (DD Form 2900,
DRHA#3) are conducted 90-180 days after redeployment. The PDHRA is not a psychological
screening, but a health risk appraisal modeled after the existing pre- and post- deployment health
assessment.
Pre-Deployment Health Assessment—The Pre-Deployment Health Assessment process and
screener (DD Form 2795, DRHA#1) are conducted within 60 days of expected deployment date.
This screener allows deploying personnel to record information about their general health and
report any concerns they have prior to deployment. It also helps health care providers identify
issues and provide medical care before deployment.
Primary Care Manager Team—Provides appropriate clinical and preventive healthcare to
enrolled populations and will be supported by the establishment of regional centers of excellence
and/or specialized treatment services.
Trained Health Care Provider—A physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner that is
credentialed, trained, and certified to administer DRHAs (Trained IDMTs may conduct DRHAs
only in deployed settings or for personnel assigned to GSUs located greater than 50 miles from
an MTF).
Unit Deployment Manager—The UDM is a member assigned to a unit that manages all
deployment readiness, training, and equipment requirements for all deployable personnel within
their unit to ensure they are deployment-ready. In addition, UDMs support redeployed personnel
in the Redeployment Support Process with commanders of their units.
