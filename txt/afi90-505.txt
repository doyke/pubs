                                            Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. To support the Commander in cultivating a fit and ready force by reducing
instances of self-directed violence.
1.2. Background.
     1.2.1. In 1996, AF top leadership noticed a rise in suicide rates and commissioned an AF
     Suicide Prevention Integrated Product Team (IPT) to develop a comprehensive suicide
     prevention program to save lives. It was determined the entire AF community had to be
     invested in the process and the result.
     1.2.2. A comprehensive, community-based, suicide prevention initiative was developed
     which emphasized leadership involvement, community awareness, and promotion of an
     environment that encouraged Airmen in distress to seek help. The AF Suicide Prevention
     Program (AFSPP) (described in Chapter 3) was one of the first efforts to apply a population
     health approach to suicide prevention and has been empirically validated as an effective
     program to reduce the incidence of suicide.
1.3. Introduction.
     1.3.1. Risk factors for suicide can include but are not limited to: relationship difficulties,
     legal and financial problems, history of a mental health diagnosis, substance misuse, and
     history of previous suicide attempts. Protective factors include: social support,
     interconnectedness, sense of belonging, effective individual coping skills, and cultural norms
     that promote and protect responsible help-seeking behavior. Most of these risk and
     protective factors are modifiable.
     1.3.2. Suicide is an extreme manifestation of psychosocial problems. A comprehensive
     suicide prevention program overseen by an effective Community Action Information Board
     (CAIB) and Integrated Delivery System (IDS) must address the entire range of stressors and
     must consider the range of behaviors that negatively affect individuals, families and
     communities. Prevention and early intervention is always preferable to crisis response. A
     community-based approach is essential to reducing suicide and maintaining a fit and ready
     force. Effective suicide prevention also entails educating individuals about healthy/adaptive
     coping strategies, building confidence, and instilling a belief that members are indeed
     resilient and able to effectively overcome future life problems.
     1.3.3. Monitoring is crucial for any effective suicide prevention program. The person most
     responsible for monitoring distress and personal effectiveness is the individual Airman. In
     this document, the term Airman refers to all active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve
     Component personnel (ANG and AFR), and Air Force civilians. Next in line are the Airmen
     who serve to our left and to our right. An Airman’s Wingmen are almost always in the best
     position to observe them on a daily basis and understand when subtle, or not so subtle,
     changes in attitudes or behavior should cause concern. We must continue to emphasize to
     our Airmen that the buddy system in regard to mental wellbeing is just as important as the
     buddy system in combat operations or medical care. Finally, as with most other areas in the
     Air Force, an Airman’s chain of command has definitive responsibility for monitoring the
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    5


  fitness and effectiveness of their personnel. Leaders of all ranks have a vested interest in
  knowing their Airmen, investing in their professional and personal development, and quickly
  addressing any issues whenever they are identified.
  1.3.4. When leadership prioritizes suicide prevention, all Airmen prioritize suicide
  prevention. Leadership must establish a culture that strengthens social support for all
  Airmen, especially those in personal crisis. Leaders need to promote early help-seeking and
  support those who ask for help. Commanders who promote preventive help seeking enhance
  the mission readiness of their Airmen.

3.1. AFSPP 11 Elements.
   3.1.1. Leadership Involvement.
      3.1.1.1. Leaders (military and civilian) shall build an environment that promotes
      healthy/adaptive behaviors, fosters the wingman culture, and encourages responsible
      help-seeking. This environment shall not tolerate any actions (hazing, belittling,
      humiliating, etc.) that discourage Airmen from responsibly seeking help or professional
      care. Frequent messaging from senior AF leaders encourages unit commander and
      supervisor involvement, which is critical to program success. Commanders will ensure
      adequate resources, policy development, implementation, and efficacy. For the remainder
      of this AFI the term commander, unless otherwise specified, will refer to both military
      commanders and their civilian equivalents. (T-1)
      3.1.1.2. AF Leaders will disseminate any policy memos or letters from senior DoD and
      AF leaders on suicide prevention throughout the calendar year.
   3.1.2. Addressing Suicide Prevention through Professional Military Education (PME).
      3.1.2.1. PME provides periodic and targeted Suicide Prevention training for Airmen,
      specifically oriented to the individual’s rank and level of responsibility. Leaders will
      understand what policies and practices promote or discourage help-seeking, and develop
      skills to detect at-risk individuals and intervene early with Airmen under stress. (T-1)
   3.1.3. Guidelines for Commanders: Use of Mental Health Services.
      3.1.3.1. Commanders are encouraged to partner and consult with the mental health staff
      about the health of their Airmen to improve their duty performance. Early self-referral
      yields the best outcome for the individual and the unit; however, there are circumstances
      when commanders must order a member to the MTF for a Mental Health evaluation
      (IAW DoDI 6490.04, Requirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the
      Military Services, AFI 44-172, Mental Health, and AFI 44-109, Mental Health and
      Military Law), substance abuse assessment (IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse
      Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program), or family advocacy issues (IAW AFI 40-
      301, Family Advocacy). Commanders must be aware of the legal implications of
      different types of referrals and consult with the legal office as needed. ARC commanders
      will be familiar with available mental health options. (T-1)
   3.1.4. Unit-based Preventive Services.
      3.1.4.1. Helping-agency professionals will partner with unit leaders to provide services at
      the worksite to increase access, encourage help-seeking, and promote familiarity, rapport,
      and trust with Airmen and their families. These services also improve unit cohesion and
      effectiveness. (T-1)
   3.1.5. Wingman Culture.
18                                                             AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014


     3.1.5.1. Wingmen must practice healthy behaviors, make responsible choices, and
     encourage others to do the same. Wingmen will foster a culture of early help-seeking.
     Wingmen will recognize the signs and symptoms of distress in themselves and others and
     take protective action. (T-1)
  3.1.6. Investigative Interview Policy (Hand-off Policy).
     3.1.6.1. Airmen facing criminal or administrative action are at increased risk for suicide.
     They can easily feel isolated from family, friends, and other social supports when
     needing them most.
     3.1.6.2. Following any subject interview, the AF investigators (e.g., AFOSI, IG, SF, and
     EEO) must hand-off the accused directly to the member’s commander, or first sergeant
     through person-to-person documented contact. For ARC units, when the commander or
     first sergeant is a traditional guardsman/reservist and unable to be contacted, the senior
     ranking unit member (E-7 or higher) on active status will receive person-to-person
     contact and in turn make notifications to the first sergeant and commander. The
     investigator will notify the unit representative that the individual was interviewed and is
     under investigation. (T-1)
     3.1.6.3. When an investigating agent believes the member may present a risk of suicide,
     he/she shall communicate that concern to the member’s commander or first sergeant, who
     will then consider making a referral for a Mental Health evaluation and possible
     placement in the LPSP program. (T-1)
     3.1.6.4. The commander or first sergeant is responsible for inquiring about the member’s
     emotional state and contacting a mental health provider for a CDE if he/she suspects a
     risk of suicide.
  3.1.7. Post-Suicide Response (Postvention).
     3.1.7.1. Suicide impacts coworkers, families, and friends. Offering support early is
     associated with increased help-seeking behavior and resilience. Post-suicide responses
     will be managed by unit leaders. The unit leaders will support affected personnel through
     the grieving process by consulting with chaplains, mental health, and Directors of
     Psychological Health, as needed. (T-1)
     3.1.7.2. Care must be taken to avoid sensationalizing, glamorizing, romanticizing or
     giving undue prominence to suicide. These practices are associated with suicide clusters,
     copycat suicides, and increased suicide rates. Following a suicide, unit leaders and
     helping professionals shall reference and implement AF post-suicide guidance (see
     Attachment 3). (T-1)
  3.1.8. CAIB and IDS.
     3.1.8.1. The CAIB and IDS provide a forum for the cross-organizational review and
     resolution of individual, family, installation, and community issues that impact the
     readiness of the force and the quality of life for Airmen and their families. The CAIB and
     IDS will help coordinate the activities of the various military and non-military helping
     agencies to achieve a synergistic impact on community problems and reduce suicide risk
     IAW AFI 90-501. Emphasizing suicide prevention at the CAIB makes IDS initiatives at
     the Installation, MAJCOM, and AF-levels more targeted and effective. (T-1)
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       19


  3.1.9. LPSP Program.
     3.1.9.1. Members under criminal or administrative investigation are at increased risk for
     suicide. To encourage this high risk group to seek help, the LPSP program affords
     increased legal protections and confidentiality. Members in this program are granted
     limited protection with respect to the information revealed during or generated by their
     clinical relationship with the mental health professional.
     3.1.9.2. Providers, patients, and commanders will understand the limited nature of LPSP
     program protection. Information in the LPSP program mental health file can be disclosed
     in the following situations: to other medical personnel for purposes of medical treatment,
     to a member’s confinement military commander, for legal proceeding against third
     parties, and to other authorized personnel with an official need to know (e.g.,
     commanders) IAW AFI 44-172, Mental Health, and AFI 44-109, Mental Health and
     Military Law. (T-1)
  3.1.10. Commander Consultation Tools.
     3.1.10.1. Use of validated unit climate assessment tools is an excellent way for
     commanders to tap into the strengths and challenges within their organizations. Results
     from these instruments can assist commanders in choosing strategies to enhance the
     wellbeing and resilience of their Airmen.
     3.1.10.2. A number of assessment tools are currently available to all commanders at no
     cost to the unit. Some of these include the Defense Equal Opportunity Climate Survey
     (DEOCS), the Support and Resilience Inventory (SRI), the Air Force Combined Mishap
     Reduction System (AFCMRS), and the Armed Forces Action Plan (AFAP) for joint
     bases.
     3.1.10.3. Commanders can consult with local Community Support Coordinators and IDS
     team members to help select the best instrument for their unit. Additionally, IDS
     agencies can help interpret the results of the chosen tool and assist in developing a plan to
     leverage the strengths of Airmen and address unmet needs within his/her units.
  3.1.11. Suicide Event Tracking and Analysis: DoD Suicide Event Report (DoDSER).
     3.1.11.1. Information on all AF suicides and suicide attempts are entered into a central
     database, currently the DoDSER, to identify suicide risk factors and trends. Collective
     analyses of useful findings are disseminated AF-wide for local application through the
     annual DoDSER report.
     3.1.11.2. This publication requires the collection and or maintenance of information
     protected by the Privacy Act (PA) of 1974. The authorities to collect and or maintain the
     records prescribed in this publication are found in Title 10 United States Code, Section
     136 and 10 U.S.C. 8013, Secretary of the Air Force; 10 U.S.C. 5013.
     3.1.11.3. In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) of
     the Privacy Act of 1974, these records, or information contained therein, may specifically
     be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) (3) as
     follows: Statistical summary data with no personally identifiable information may be
     provided to federal, state, and local governments for health surveillance and research.
20                                                           AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014


     3.1.11.4. The DoD Blanket Routine Uses published at the beginning of the Office of the
     Secretary of Defense compilation of record system notices apply to this system, except as
     stipulated in Notes below.
     3.1.11.5. For suspected suicides of active duty or equivalent ARC members, data
     collection and post-suicide assessments will be completed at the decedent’s installation.
     This review process will collect and report information to comply with the DoDSER
     requirements, established in 2008 by the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and
     Readiness. (T-1)
     3.1.11.6. A DoDSER will be completed for the following groups: (T-1)
        3.1.11.6.1. All Airmen in duty status (Title 10/32) who die by suicide or who
        attempt suicide.
     3.1.11.7. MAJCOM, Forward Operating Areas (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU)
     and the ARC (ANG and AFR) have the authority to conduct additional reviews on
     suicides by civilians and members, regardless of duty status within their commands.
     3.1.11.8. A DoDSER will be completed for suicide attempts and suicides within the
     required time frames. For suicide attempts, entries are due 30 days from the date of
     medical treatment or evacuation from theater. For suicides, DoDSER entries are due 60
     days from the date the Office Armed Forces Medical Examiner determines manner of
     death to be suicide for active duty service members and 90 days for guardsmen and
     reservists in duty status (Title 10/32).(ARC personnel refer to para 3.1.11.6.) (T-1)
     3.1.11.9. At ARC wings where no mental health personnel are assigned, active duty
     mental health personnel (co-located wings) or a privileged provider will complete the
     appropriate DoDSER entry. Additionally, the DPH, if privileged may complete the
     DoDSER entry. If not privileged, the DPH may collaborate with the privileged ARC
     medical provider to complete the DoDSER entry..
     3.1.11.10. For reportable events that occur in a deployed setting the DoDSER will be
     completed at the service member’s home station. (T-1)
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        21


                                           Chapter 4

                              EDUCATION AND TRAINING

4.1. Suicide Prevention. Suicide prevention training will be delivered to Airmen through a
tiered and targeted approach. (T-1)
4.1.1. Tier 1: Foundational Training.
      4.1.1.1. All new Airmen will receive suicide prevention training during accessions
      through a face-to-face format. Upon training completion, Airmen will be able to identify
      and mitigate risk factors for suicide. (T-1)
      4.1.1.2. First Term Airmen’s Center (FTAC) attendees will also receive face-to-face
      training IAW AFI 36-2624, The Career Assistance Advisor, First Term Airmen Center
      and Enlisted Professional Enhancement Programs. (T-1)
      4.1.1.3. Airmen will complete annual Total Force Awareness Training (TFAT) (IAW
      AFI 36-2201). This training provides information about how to identify and assist others
      at risk for suicide and how to help them. The program identifies and emphasizes
      protective factors, the benefit of seeking help early in the development of life problems,
      and the benefit of engaging in health-promoting activities. The program helps identify
      and mitigate risk factors for suicide, increases the protective factors for AF personnel (see
      Attachment 2) and teaches the Ask, Care, Escort model for seeking help. The minimum
      requirement for TFAT is computer based training (CBT), however unit commanders are
      highly encouraged to conduct suicide prevention training face-to-face using the CBT
      slides to facilitate small group discussions. Unit commanders who opt for face-to-face
      annual training must ensure that unit training monitors document this training in
      Advanced Distance Learning System (ADLS) using the offline course completion tool.
      (T-1)
      4.1.1.4. Given the composition and operating environment of the ARC, additional
      training may be developed and distributed in coordination with the respective ANG and
      AFR CAIB/IDS, to include supplemental suicide prevention training materials for all
      levels of accession, technical training, and professional military education that uniquely
      address ARC part-time force culture and environment. Any developed content should be
      consistent with the AF Public Affairs Guidance for Suicide Prevention.
   4.1.2. Tier 2: Targeted Training for At-Risk Groups.
      4.1.2.1. At-risk groups, as designated by the AF CAIB, will complete face-to-face annual
      suicide prevention training, in lieu of CBT. (T-1)
      4.1.2.2. Supervisors of Airmen in at-risk groups must attend a one-time face-to-face
      Frontline Supervisors Training (FST) and annual maintenance trainings in addition to the
      annual suicide prevention face-to-face training. (T-1)
      4.1.2.3. New supervisors in these fields must complete the required training within 90
      days of assuming supervisory responsibility. If the supervisor deploys during the initial
      90-day window, the supervisor must complete the required training within 90 days of
      return. (T-1)
22                                                             AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014


     4.1.2.4. New ARC frontline supervisors working with at-risk groups will complete the
     required frontline supervisor training within 180 days of assuming supervisory
     responsibility. If the supervisor deploys during the initial 180-day window, the supervisor
     will complete the required training within 180 days of return or upon the first available
     date of training. (T-1)
  4.1.3. Tier 3: Managing Personnel in Distress.
     4.1.3.1. Personnel in units or positions with a high probability for encountering
     personnel in distress (e.g., AFOSI, mental health, security forces, Judge Advocate,
     chaplains, Airman and Family Readiness Center, commanders, and first sergeants) will
     complete agency-specific training on LPSP, the Investigative Interview hand-off policy,
     appropriate intervention and referral procedures. (T-1)
     4.1.3.2. Installation SPPM or a designated POC from Mental Health, the ANG DPH or
     designated ARC personnel will provide training to AF investigative agency personnel on
     LPSP, investigative interview hand-off procedures, and accessing local emergency
     services. Active duty training is required within 60 days of reporting for assignment at a
     new duty location, ARC training is required within 90 days of reporting at a new duty
     location. (T-1)
     4.1.3.3. All military MTF mental health providers will complete annual training on the
     AF clinical guidelines for managing suicidal behavior. (T-1)
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      23

                        METRICS AND ANNUAL ASSESSMENT

5.1. Suicide Prevention Training Metrics.
5.1.1. Demographic and epidemiological data on suicide and suicide attempts shall be
updated annually and obtained from Telehealth and Technology. (T-1)
   5.1.2. Annual Suicide Prevention training and Frontline Supervisor Training will be
   completed IAW Chapter 4. Frontline Supervisor Training will be completed by supervisors
   in groups designated by the AF CAIB Chair. (T-1)
       5.1.2.1. Completion of annual suicide prevention training and FST will be documented
       in ADLS. For ANG, ARNet may be used if directed. (T-1)
       5.1.2.2. Unit Training Monitors (UTM) must track the annual training and FST
       completions for unit personnel and provide statistics upon request to the installation
       SPPM and the installation CAIB for review and action as necessary. (T-1)
          5.1.2.2.1. For the ANG this responsibility is coordinated responsibility between the
          Force Development Office-Base Training Manager (FDO)/Unit Training Manager.
          (T-1)
       5.1.2.3. The annual suicide prevention training and FST completion rates must be
       reviewed quarterly by the installation SPPM and the installation CAIB. ARC CAIBs will
       review suicide prevention training and FST completion rates semi-annually. The
       Installation CAIB will forward annual suicide prevention total force requirements and
       FST metrics to the MAJCOM CAIB/IDS and the MAJCOM Mental Health Consultant
       (MHC). For ANG, the Behavioral Health Branch will function as the ANG Mental
       Health Consultant. (T-1)
       5.1.2.4. Each MAJCOM CAIB/IDS will aggregate FST and annual suicide prevention
       training total force metrics and report currency data to the AFSPPM at HQ
       AFMSA/SG3OQ for each calendar year within 31 days of its close. The MAJCOM MHC
       will forward the data. (T-1)
   5.1.3. MAJCOM military and civilian training will be reported by the command-appointed
   SPPM. Reports must include training data that are collected on a quarterly basis from the IDS
   to address the following metrics: Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR), Total Personnel
   Current (TPC), and Percentage Current. MAJCOMs must report aggregate data from
   installation-level data to the AF CAIB/IDS for each metric in a spreadsheet format. (T-1)
   5.1.4. ANG/SG will track the accomplishment of suicide prevention training requirements
   for the ANG on an annual basis. ANG/SG will also provide a copy of these results to DANG.
   (T-1)
5.2. Statistics Available to Support Total Force Education:
   5.2.1. The Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (OAFME) maintains and forwards
   summary statistics, updated on a quarterly basis, to AFMSA/SG3OQ, which reflect the
   epidemiological perspective of Air Force suicide rates, attempt rates, and associated risk and
 24                                                              AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014


   protective factors for Airmen in duty status (Title 10/32) status. AFR, ANG, and AFPC will
   provide training statistics only; reliable epidemiological data are not available on suicides or
   nonfatal self-injuries that occur for civilian employees or while ARC members not in duty
   status. (T-1)
   5.2.2. DoDSER is the official database for Airmen in Title 10/32 status suicides and suicide
   attempts. This integrated data will be available for use at MAJCOM level units in support of
   their training and intervention efforts.
       5.2.2.1. DoDSER suicide entry completion should be reviewed by MAJCOM CAIBs
       quarterly. MAJCOM DoDSER suicide entry completions will be reviewed at HAF CAIB
       quarterly.
5.3. AFSPP Annual Self-Assessment of 11 Elements
5.3.1. To ensure effective implementation of all AFSPP 11 Elements each installation must
complete an annual self-assessment at the end of each calendar year. AFI 90-201, The Air
Force Inspection Program, provides for a self-assessment checklist containing installation level
compliance requirements for AFI 90-505, Suicide Prevention Program. The AFSPP 11 Elements
checklist has been published in MICT. (T-1)

                               AF LEADER’S POST-SUICIDE CHECKLIST

    AF Leader’s Post-Suicide Checklist
Purpose: This checklist is designed to assist leaders in guiding their response to suicides and
suicide attempts. Research suggests the response by a unit’s leadership can play a role in the
prevention of additional suicides/suicide events or, in worst cases, inadvertently contribute to
increased suicides/suicide attempts (suicide contagion).

This checklist is intended to augment any local policies. It incorporates “lessons learned” from
leaders who have experienced suicide deaths in their unit. It is a guide intended to support a
leader’s judgment and experience. The checklist does not outline every potential contingency
which may come from a suicide or suicide attempt.

A second checklist, Guidance for Actions Following a Suicide Attempt, is attached at the end of
this section.
Guidance for Actions Following a Death by Suicide

1        Contact local law enforcement/Security Forces, AFOSI, and 911 (situation dependent). AFOSI Duty Agent
         can be contacted after hours through the Law Enforcement Desk or Command Post.

2        Notify First Sergeant, Command Post and Chain of Command. Command Post will initiate Operational
         Reporting (OPREP) messages. (Command Post will notify FSS/CL and Mortuary Affairs.)
         Notify Mental Health Clinic or Mental Health on-call provider, or ARC equivalent, to prepare activation of the
3        Traumatic Stress Response (TSR/DMH) Team. Command Post can assist with contacting Mental Health after
         duty hours.

4        Validate with JA and AFOSI who has jurisdiction of the scene and medical investigation. Normally, local
         medical examiners/coroners have medical incident authority in these cases but some locations may vary.

         Contact Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR) to notify Next of Kin (NOK) IAW AFI 36-3002, Casualty
5        Services and receive briefing on managing casualty affairs. Wing Commander or office designee makes
         notification if NOK is in local area. CAR can assist.
         Consult with TSR/DMH Team Chief or on-call Mental Health provider to prepare announcement to unit and
         co-workers. Review Air Force Leader’s Guide for Post-Suicide Response PowerPoint (available
6
         at:http://www.afms.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-130613-030.pdf for just-in-time considerations
         offered by other leaders and key components of post-suicide programming.
         Make initial announcement to work site with a balance of “need to know” and rumor control. Consider having
7        TSR/DMH team members present for support to potentially distraught personnel, but avoid using a
         “psychological debriefing” model. Make initial announcement to work site/unit.

8        Consult with Public Affairs regarding public statements about the suicide and refer to the Public Affairs
         Guidance (PAG) for Suicide Prevention.
         When speaking to the work site/unit, avoid announcing specific details of the suicide, merely state it was a
         suicide or reported suicide. Do not mention the method used. Location is announced as either on-base or off-
9
         base. Do not announce specific location, who found the body, whether or not a note was left, or why the
         member may have killed himself
         Avoid glorifying/idealizing deceased or conveying the suicide is different from any other death. Consult with
10       Mental Health, the Chaplain, and your mentors/Chain of Command for any actions being considered for
         memorial response.
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                                            37


     When engaging in public discussions of the suicide:
     1) Express sadness at the Air Force’s loss and acknowledge the grief of the survivors;
     2) Emphasize the unnecessary nature of suicide as alternatives are readily available;
     3) Express disappointment that the Airman did not choose the help that was available;
11   4) Ensure the audience knows you and the Air Force want personnel to seek assistance when distressed,
     including those who are presently affected;
     5) Encourage Wingmen to be attuned to those who may be grieving or having a difficult time following the
     suicide, especially those close to the deceased; and
     6) Provide brief reminder of warning signs for suicide.

12   After death announcement is made to the work center, follow-up your comments in an e-mail provided to the
     community affected. Restate the themes noted above.

     Unless you discern there is a risk of being perceived as disingenuous, consider increasing senior leadership
13   presence in the work area immediately following announcement of death. Engage informally with personnel
     and communicate message of support and information. Presence initially should be fairly intensive and then
     decrease over the next 30 days to a tempo you find appropriate.
     Consult with Chaplain regarding Unit Sponsored Memorial Services. Memorial services are important
     opportunities to foster resilience by helping survivors understand, heal, and move forward in as healthy a
     manner as possible. However, any public communication after a suicide, including a memorial service, has the
     potential to either increase or decrease the suicide risk of those receiving the communication. It is important to
     have an appropriate balance between recognizing the member's military service and expressing disappointment
     about the manner of death. If not conducted properly, a memorial service may lead to adulation of the suicide
     event and thus potentially trigger "copycat" events. Therefore, memorial services should avoid idealizing the
     deceased or the current state of peace found through death. Avoid normalizing suicide by inferring it is an
14   acceptable reaction/response to distressful situations. Make clear distinctions between positive
     accomplishments/qualities and the act of suicide. Focus on personal feelings and feelings of survivors. Express
     disappointment in deceased's decision and concern for survivors. Promote help-seeking and the Wingman
     concept. The goals are to:
          1) Comfort the grieving;
          2) Help survivors deal with guilt;
          3) Help survivors with anger;
          4) Encourage Airmen/family members to seek help;
          5) Prevent “imitation” suicides.
     Public memorials such as plaques, trees, or flags at half-mast may, in rare situations, encourage other at-risk
15   people to attempt suicide in a desperate bid to obtain respect or adulation for themselves. Therefore, these types
     of memorials are not recommended.
     Utilize or refer grieving co-workers to IDS community-based resources. For Military beneficiaries, consider
     Mental Health, Chaplain, Airman & Family Readiness, and Military One Source (1-800-342-9647). For
     civilians, consider Employee Assistance Program and follow-up services through TSR/DMH (consult with
16
     TSR/DMH team chief on details, if needed). If non-beneficiaries (i.e., extended family members, fiancé or
     boy/girlfriends) are struggling and asking for help, refer them to community-based services and/or discuss
     options with a mental health consultant or competent medical authority.
     Ensure DoDSER completion and participate, as requested, with any appointed independent reviewer process
     (suicide review for installation/MAJCOM, or Medical Incident Investigation (MII). Avoid defensiveness.
17
     Acknowledge the processes are intended to determine if there are any ‘lessons learned’ in regards to suicide
     prevention, not to affix blame.
     Anniversaries of suicide (1 month, 6 month, 1 year, etc.) are periods of increased risk. Promote healthy
18
     behaviors and the Wingman concept during these periods.
    38                                                                            AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014



Guidance for Actions Following a Suicide Attempt
Purpose: This checklist is designed to assist leaders in regards to addressing suicide attempts by
those in their unit. There can be many factors considered in a person’s decision to attempt
suicide, and the proper response to the attempt can diminish the risk factors for another attempt,
and greatly aid in restoring the individual to the work center with minimal disruption.

         As noted in the Air Force Leader’s Guide for Post-Suicide Response PowerPoint (available at:
         http://www.afms.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-130613-031.pdf suicide is an act made by a person
         seeking relief from real or perceived pain.
         A person who makes a suicide attempt may have either (1) been prevented from making an action they
1        intended to result in death; (2) not intended to die, but felt the need to demonstrate an attempt for others to
         know they are in pain; (3) been under the influence of drugs (including alcohol) which caused an impaired
         decision (often referred to as ‘impulsive’); (4) been suffering from mental illness and extremely impaired but
         did not die as a consequence of the suicide plan.

2        Contact local law enforcement/Security Forces, AFOSI, and 911 (situation dependent). AFOSI Duty Agent
         can be contacted after hours through the Law Enforcement Desk or Command Post.
         Notify First Sergeant, Command Post, Chain of Command and Mental Health clinic or the on-call Mental
         Health provider if afterhours. Command Post will initiate Operational Reporting (OPREP) messages.
3        (Command Post will notify FSS/CL). Ensure notifications are kept to short list of “need to know” and contain
         minimum amount of information to convey nature of critical event. Being appropriate with “need to know”
         helps avoid stigmatizing the member’s return to a work center where many people are aware of what happened.
         If attempt was by an Airman in duty status (Title 10/32): Notify the nearest active duty Mental Health Clinic
         or Mental Health on-call provider to consult on safety planning, a fitness for duty determination and
4        coordination of a possible Commander Directed Evaluation (CDE).
         If an attempt was by a civilian the Mental Health Clinic or on-call provider can provide guidance on options.
         Generally, civilian authorities and hospitals will be the lead agents for response to the attempt.
         If the attempt has occurred in the workplace: Notify local law enforcement/Security Forces, AFOSI and Chain
         of Command. Ensure the area of the attempt has been secured and contact the nearest active duty Mental
5
         Health Clinic or Mental Health on-call provider or ARC equivalent for consultation and potential TSR/DMH
         activation.
         A suicide attempt requires formal Mental Health assessment and often will result in hospitalization to stabilize
6        the individual and ensure safety. If the member is hospitalized, it is recommended you consult with Mental
         Health and your Chain of Command regarding visiting the person while they are in the hospital.
         Returning to work: A person who has experienced a crisis may find returning to work to be comforting (a sense
         of normalcy) or distressing. Work may need to be tailored to accommodate for medical/Mental Health follow-
         up appointments and assessed abilities of the person upon their return. The goal is to gradually return to full
         duties as appropriate.
         If in duty status (Title 10/32): Ensure the Airman is cleared for return to duty by a privileged Mental Health
         and their Primary Care Manager (PCM). PCM Consultation between Mental Health/PCM and Command can
         ensure a work schedule that accommodates the active duty member provides additional supervision and support
         without risk of showing secondary gain for having attempted suicide.
7
              Recommendations:
                             “No Drink” order
                             Non-weapons bearing duties
                             Secure personal weapons, providing a safe alternative (i.e., base armory)
         If civilian: Recommend discussing alcohol and weapons. Engage with employee to ensure they provide
         documentation indicating they are medically cleared by their treating medical/Mental Health provider to return
         to the work environment. Coordinate with Civilian Personnel Office on accommodations (if required) to work
         schedule and work environment.
AFI90-505 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                                                          39



     A returning member must not be treated as fragile or ‘damaged.’ If they sense they are being ‘singled out’ or
     treated differently in the presence of peers, it can damage the recovery process. Freely speak with the employee
8
     about being receptive to their thoughts on returning to work and how to avoid the perception of ‘walking on
     egg shells.’
     Consider leave requests carefully. Support the employee by ensuring leave requests involve structured time or
9    planned events that will enhance them as they take time away from work. ARC leaders are encouraged to
     collaborate with civilian employers after obtaining permission from the member to do so.
10   Ensure all members of the unit are aware that seeking Mental Health is a sign of strength and helps protect
     mission and family by improving personal functioning instead of having personal suffering.
     Never underestimate the power of the simple statement: “What can I do to be helpful to your recovery
11
     process?”
     Consult with Mental Health providers to develop a supportive plan to re-integrate the Airman into the
12
     workplace.
     Engage family and support networks to increase support and surveillance of the Airman. Encourage family and
13
     friends to reach out to the unit if they become concerned about the Airman’s emotional state.
     Ensure a DoDSER entry is completed for all suicide attempts which result in hospitalization or evacuation from
14
     the AOR.
