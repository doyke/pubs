2. Entry Procedures:
     2.1. 480 ISR Wing, Building 23, is a controlled area. Hours of operation for the Entry
     Control Point (ECP) are 0700 to 1600 (as manning permits) Monday through Friday; after
     duty hours, contact the Wing Operations Center (WOC) at 225-0586. Personnel entering and
     exiting this facility are tracked either electronically or via the visitor registration log (AF
     Form 1109). Each individual entering or exiting Building 23 will either sign in/out or utilize
     the card readers. When requesting entry, individuals are required to present a valid picture
480ISRWI31-102 10 JUNE 2014                                                                      3


   ID, DoD ID number or Social Security Number (SSN) to the SO for identification and
   clearance verification.
   2.2. Building 23 has a single point of entry at the front of the building. All other doors are
   used for emergency exit only. Door 9 (warehouse/dock) access will be approved on a case-
   by-case basis and must be approved by the SO.
   2.3. Permanent ECBs will be given to military, civilian, contractors, and Air Reserve/Guard
   members assigned to the 480 ISR Wing, 27 IS and AFOSI. Personnel assigned to the 497
   ISR GP requiring swipe-access must get approval from the Chief, Wing Security.
   (EXCEPTION: 10 IS personnel working full-time in Building 23 do not need SO approval;
   individuals need to bring their 497 ISR GP badge to Wing SO to be coded).
      2.3.1. Personnel with a permanent ECB and a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
      access the building by swiping the ECB across the badge-reader and entering the PIN on
      the keypad. If after three attempts, access is not granted and the red light on the ECB
      reader is lit, the individual must contact the ECP. At no time will an individual without a
      working permanent ECB be allowed unescorted entry in Building 23.
      2.3.2. The ECB will be displayed above the waist with the photograph in plain view at
      all times.
      2.3.3. Personnel who work in Building 23 who forget their ECB will be issued the
      appropriate “Visitor” badge.
      2.3.4. When leaving, personnel must swipe their badge then remove/secure it from sight.
   2.4. Federal civilian employees, military personnel, and contractors whose principal place of
   work is Building 23, are authorized to perform escort duties. Escorts must be thoroughly
   familiar with their responsibilities (see paragraphs 3 through 3.3.2).
   2.5. Personnel will scan their ECB to access authorized areas of Building 23. “Tail-gaiting”
   or “piggy-backing” (personnel entering without scanning in) is not allowed. EXCEPTION:
   Properly credentialed visitors (reciprocal badge holders and properly escorted individuals)
   without swipe access may tailgate.
3. Escort/ECB Procedures for Visitors:
   3.1. Building occupants must notify the ECP three duty days in advance when visitors are
   expected. All visitors must have a sponsor assigned to Building 23; sponsors are responsible
   for their guests while in the facility. All badges will be worn above the waist and displayed
   with the number and “VISITOR” in plain view at all times. When entering/departing
   workspaces with individuals who are not indoctrinated or cleared, escorts will carry a
   flashing red light and loudly announce the presence of a “red” or “blue-badge” to allow
   personnel time to sanitize the area. These individuals will not be, under any circumstance,
   left unattended inside the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Before
   leaving the building, escorts will take visitors to the ECP to sign out and turn-in their badge.
   After duty hours, the badge will be left in the security drop box.
   3.2. Green or Yellow ECB. Federal civilian and military personnel who have verified SCI
   access are issued a green badge. SCI-cleared contractors are issued a yellow badge.
 4                                                             480ISRWI31-102 10 JUNE 2014


     3.3. Blue ECB. Personnel with a verified collateral clearance are issued a blue ECB. These
     individuals may be allowed to work unescorted in the supply/facility manager’s workcenter
     and the warehouse only. INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ESCORTED WHEN ENTERING
     OR DEPARTING THE SCIF.
     3.4. RED ECB. Personnel who do not have a security clearance are issued a red ECB. THE
     VISITOR WILL BE ESCORTED AT ALL TIMES WHILE IN BUILDING 23. The
     necessity to badge a child will be determined by ECP staff.
     3.5. ECBs for Conference Attendees. SCI-cleared personnel who are attending a conference
     in Building 23 will be issued a green or yellow swipe Visitor ECB. Collateral/uncleared
     visitors will not have swipe-badge privileges and must remain under constant escort. Visitors
     will remove and secure the ECB when leaving the facility. At the end of the conference,
     ECBs will be returned to the sponsor or left in the security drop box. Groups/tours visiting
     Building 23 and continuing to the 497 ISR GP may take the badge out of the building with
     approval from the SO; the POC is responsible for returning the badges to 480 ISR WG ECP.
        3.5.1. Conference POCs/hosts will coordinate the visit with SO NLT 3 duty days prior
        to the event. Send the attendees’ full name, DoD ID Number, organization/company,
        and    duty phone       to   the    Wing     Visitor    Control  Organization   box
        (480ISRWG/SOVisitControl@langley.af.mil) for clearance verification. POCs will
        only provide the attendee’s SSN if the individual does not have a DoD ID number.
        Ensure any personally identifiable information (PII) transmitted over NIPRNET is
        encrypted.
        3.5.2. POCs will be available to expedite badge-issue on the first day of the conference.
        They will sign/take responsibility for distributing and collecting all badges; these are
        controlled items that must be returned to the SO at the end of the conference.
     3.6. Personnel not assigned to the 480 ISR WG or 27 IS who require a permanent-access
     ECB must have a sponsor assigned to Building 23. Requests must be made through the
     individual’s security manager to SO using the 480 ISR WG ECB Request Memorandum
     (Attachment 2). The request must explain the reason and frequency of access. SO will
     coordinate the request through the wing/vice commander/TD for approval.
     3.7. Official deliveries (Base Information and Transfer Center/UPS/FEDEX, etc.) will be
     scheduled with 480 ISR WG/CCEA at 225-3542 during standard duty hours (Monday
     through Friday, between 0700 and 1700).
     3.8. Lost ECBs. Individuals who lose their ECB must report it to the Security Office within
     24 hours of discovery. The member must complete a Loss of Building 23 Entry Control
     Badge Memorandum (Attachment 3), and turn it in to the Chief, Wing Security, who will
     hold it for 5 duty days to allow time for recovery. If the ECB is not found after 5 duty days,
     the letter is processed for investigation. Upon Chief, Wing Security approval, a new ECB
     will be issued and a copy of the memorandum will be placed in the individual’s special
     security file.
4. After Duty Hours.
     4.1. Any Building 23 occupant with swipe access may enter the building for official business
     with their ECB and PIN.
480ISRWI31-102 10 JUNE 2014                                                                         5


   4.2. Visitors should be limited to normal duty hours. After-hour visitor requests must be
   coordinated in advance with the SO and 27 IS WOC Chief.
   4.3. Unverified emergency responders/maintenance personnel must be escorted at all times
   while in Building 23. In the event of an emergency, where life, safety, or property are at risk,
   responders will sign-in on the visitor log after the situation is brought under control.
5. Equipment/Material Policy.
   5.1. Certain items will not be brought into the SCIF because they are potential
   security/safety hazards; these include firearms, ammunition, and explosive devices.
   Personally-owned photographic equipment, headphones, video and audio recording devices,
   e-readers, MP3 players, computers, removable storage media (e.g., flash drives, memory
   cards, hard drives, personally-owned DVDs), and portable electronic devices (PEDs) are also
   prohibited.
      5.1.1. Commercially-produced music CDs must be marked with the owner’s name and
      telephone number; they will only be played on personal CD-players that have been
      approved by the SO.
      5.1.2. ALL magnetic media, entering or exiting the SCIF, including items used for
      official business, must be listed in the media log located in the main hallway.
      Additionally, ALL magnetic media must be registered with the media librarian (225-
      5620) and deregistered when items are permanently removed from the SCIF or destroyed.
      5.1.3. PEDs such as i-Phones or Blackberries will not be brought into the SCIF. If stored
      in the lobby lockers, phones must be turned off or set on vibrate. This restriction also
      applies to government-owned equipment.
      5.1.4. A Laptop Authorization Request Memorandum, (Attachment 4), must be
      submitted and routed through SO (225-8735) and the Building 23 IAO (225-3481) when
      bringing laptops into the SCIF.
   5.2. All personnel are subject to search upon entering/exiting Building 23 and may be asked
   to present hand-carried items for inspection in accordance with 480 ISR WG Instruction 31-
   101, Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) Entry and Exit Random
   Inspections. Inspections are a physical security safeguard to prevent introduction of
   unauthorized items into the building and to prevent unauthorized removal of government and
   classified material. Inspections are limited to the articles being carried into/out of the facility
   and may include purses, briefcases, newspapers, notebooks, magazines, gym bags, etc.
   5.3. Photography or videotaping in Building 23 will be for official purposes only. All
   requests must be approved by the SO using the Request for Authorization for
   Videotaping/Still Photography in Building 23 (Attachment 5). NOTE: Operations security
   measures require removal of all ECBs prior to photographing/videotaping. Photography of
   operations for official classified/unclassified products requires prior coordination with SO.
   5.4. Building 23 has a 100% shred policy for all paper (including post-its/unofficial mail
   received from outside or commercial agencies) and magnetic media. Residents will ensure
   classified/sensitive holdings are kept to a minimum. Unclassified magazines, books,
   brochures, newspapers, catalogs, etc., may be recycled after removing/shredding the address
   labels & any preaddressed order forms. (NOTE: Pages with any handwritten notes must be
 6                                                             480ISRWI31-102 10 JUNE 2014


     shredded). Paper shredders are available throughout the building and will be used to destroy
     unnecessary documents. Memorandums that identify the highest classification level for each
     machine are posted on/near each shredder. A CD/DVD shredder is located in the security
     office and media library. Users will notify the media librarian before shredding CD/DVDs
     so the database can be updated. Burn bags will not be used in Building 23.
        5.4.1. Hard drives, video/audio tapes, circuit boards, plastic components, and other
        material that cannot be shredded will be turned in during a scheduled magnetic-media run
        to Ft Meade MD. Component turn-in will be coordinated with the Building 23 IAO and
        SO. Do not drop items off at SO for destruction and/or turn-in.
        5.4.2. The fourth Thursday in March is designated as the Building 23 Annual Classified
        Cleanout Day. Each office will review their holdings and destroy all unnecessary items
        to preclude recognition or reconstruction. Personnel should also use this opportunity to
        review and destroy unnecessary FOUO/PII material.
6. Reciprocity.
     6.1. SO accepts all in-scope security clearance or access determinations (without waivers,
     conditions or deviations) from other AF units and Intelligence-Community agencies.
     6.2. The 480 ISR WG has badge reciprocity with Headquarters ACC/A2S, 497 ISR GP and
     its subordinate units, AFC2IC, Air Force Targeting Center and DGS-X. Picture badges from
     these organizations are accepted as entry credentials for Building 23; however, individuals
     must still sign in/out on the visitor log and are authorized to piggy-back/tailgate. Note: 480
     ISR WG and 497 ISR GP visitor badges may be used in the other’s facility with prior
     coordination.
7. Non-Discussion Areas.
     7.1. Classified information will not be discussed in break-rooms, restrooms, and hallways.
     The SO may designate, as required, other non-discussion areas. Discussing classified
     information in common areas is a practice dangerous to security and must be reported to SO
     immediately.
8. Building 23 Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
     8.1. The building has a 24/7, alarmed IDS on all external doors; monitoring stations are in
     the ECP and WOC. If an external door is opened, the alarm will sound. It is everyone’s
     responsibility to physically secure the door and immediately notify the SO (during duty
     hours) or WOC (after duty hours). SO or the WOC will contact security forces. If a
     suspected security breach has occurred, immediately call 633d Security Forces (911) and
     guard the door until relieved.
     8.2. SO personnel will be notified whenever an unannounced alarm or suspected breach
     occurs. A member of SO, if available, will respond to review security camera footage and
     assist security forces personnel in their investigation.
9. Courier.
     9.1. Only individuals who have a DD Form 2501 (Courier Card) or courier authorization
     letter signed by the SO will remove classified material from Building 23. Couriers will be
     briefed and are responsible for ensuring material is marked, double-wrapped, and transported
480ISRWI31-102 10 JUNE 2014                                                                       7


   in a locked container. Courier credentials are required when transporting classified material
   into or out of Building 23. DD Forms 2501 will only be issued to individuals who frequently
   transport classified material.
   9.2. Collateral information, up to SECRET, may be sent through the Building 23 mailroom.
   9.3. SCI or collateral TOP SECRET material must be mailed via the Defense Courier
   System (DCS). SO is the POC for DCS shipments.
10. Security Management.
   10.1. Security is everyone’s responsibility. Individuals will ensure all classified material,
   including folders, binders, working papers, slides and electronic media, is properly marked
   and protected IAW DoD Manual 5105.21 Vol 1; DoD Manual 5200.01, Vol 2; DoD Manual
   5200.01 Vol 3; DoD Manual 5200.01 V4, and the Intelligence Community Classification and
   Control Markings Implementation Manual. Privacy Act (PA) and classified material will be
   concealed with the appropriate coversheet when not secured or left unattended. Encrypt all
   unclassified emails containing PII or FOUO information.
   10.2. Immediately report all suspected security violations to SO.            If necessary, the
   commander will appoint an inquiry official.
   10.3. The SF Form 701, Activity Security Checklist, will be used as the end-of-day checklist,
   at a minimum, in offices with security containers. The containers must be listed on the SF
   Form 701. Completed forms must be kept for 90 days. If any office routinely closes and
   secures any additional “inner” vault/secure room at the end of each duty day, the occupant or
   “owner” of that vault/room will also conduct end of day checks and document them on an SF
   Form 702 and SF Form 701. For all offices without additional “inner” vaults, secure rooms
   or containers, the End-of-Day security check conducted by the SO to document securing and
   alarming of all access points to the facility will suffice. SO will ensure the main entry point’s
   access control system is functioning properly on the SF Form 701.
   10.4. The SF Form 700, Security Container Information, will be used to record the date the
   combination is changed, location of the container (or door) and the names, addresses, and
   home phone numbers of the individuals who will be contacted if the container is found open
   and unattended. If used, Part II of the SF 700 will be stored in a separate security container
   that is cleared to the same or higher level.
   10.5. The SF Form 702, Security Container Check Sheet, will be used to record all security
   container openings/closings.
   10.6. Before using, verify the classification level of copiers and shredders. SO is responsible
   for ensuring authorization memorandums are posted near each machine.
   10.7. At publication, there are no classified faxes in Building 23. Classified digital senders
   are located in the IAO office and Room 87.
   10.8. Individuals must report to SO, in writing, any significant changes in personal status
   which include, but not limited to: name changes; marriage/divorce; cohabitation with or
   intent to marry a non-US citizen; adverse involvement with law enforcement; DUI/DWI;
   traffic violations of $300 or more; credit judgments; bankruptcy filing or repossessions.

     10.9. Users must take reasonable steps to minimize unauthorized access to controlled
     unclassified information (CUI) which includes FOUO material. The individual who
     possesses/controls the information, not the prospective recipient, determines whether
     someone has a need for access. CUI must be shielded when not in use or left unattended.
     10.10. FOUO material may be sent via first class mail, parcel post, or, for bulk shipments,
     by fourth class mail. It may also be sent via encrypted email or faxed (the sender is
     responsible for determining that appropriate protection will be available at the receiving
     location prior to transmission). Additionally, all unclassified information must be reviewed
     and approved through standard DoD processes before it is released.
     10.11. DoD personnel may be subject to criminal/administration sanctions if they
     knowingly, willfully or negligently disclose CUI to unauthorized persons.
11. Conclusion:
     11.1. The information you have just read is designed to assist you in fulfilling your security
     responsibilities. It by no means describes the total extent of your obligations to protect
     classified/CUI material. You are expected to be mindful of the importance of the work being
     accomplished in Building 23 and the unique sensitivity of its operations.
