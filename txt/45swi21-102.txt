This publication implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, and fulfills the
requirements of AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, 16 August
2011, Paragraph 3.2.2 to develop a coordinated wing instruction to control tools, equipment, and
electronic devices from all wing agencies dispatching to aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas or
aircraft maintenance facilities. It applies to all 45 Space Wing units that bring tools onto the
aircraft parking/runways/taxi areas or aircraft maintenance facilities at Patrick Air Force Base
and/or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, with one exception. Aircraft maintenance agencies
within 45th Operations Group (45 OG) and their contractor are the exception that will follow the
stricter guidance in AFI 21-101, 45 SWI 21-101, and applicable local and MAJCOM
supplements. For non-Aircraft Maintenance tool control activities, the acting agencies will refer
to their governing Air Force Instructions and regulations appropriate to its functional discipline.
This AFI may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that directly implement this
publication must be routed to SAF/AAII Policy Branch for coordination prior to certification and
approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified
with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated
with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the
appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered
compliance items.

1. General Positive control and accountability of tools, equipment and electronic devices used
on aircraft parking, runway and taxi areas are essential for the elimination of FOD (Foreign
Object Debris). FOD-related incidents cost the Air Force millions of dollars each year. The
purpose of this publication is to provide 45 SW agencies the necessary guidance to implement a
solid program to control tools and equipment taken onto the airfield. Due to the diverse nature of
45 SW agencies, one size does not fit all when it comes to tool control policy. Some units may
have only a few items, while others account for hundreds of pieces of equipment. To comply
with this instruction, units must establish a program or demonstrate that existing programs meet
the intent of positive tool and equipment accountability and control.
2. Definitions
     2.1. Tool: Device/instrument used to perform maintenance and repair of Real Property
     facilities, roadways, airfields, airfield systems, power distribution systems, airfield lighting,
     aircraft barriers, and utility functions.
     2.2. Equipment: A device required to accomplish a task or carry out work, such as
     surveyors’ transit, portable generator, etc.
     2.3. Electronic Device: Portable items such as but not limited to the following, land mobile
     radios (LMR), cell phones, and laptop computers.
     2.4. Airfield: Includes all areas of the installation involved in aircraft operations, such as
     taxiways, parking ramps, hardstands, and the runway.
     2.5. Aircraft and flight line maintenance facilities: Includes all buildings & structures inside
     PL2 and PL3 areas, aircraft maintenance hangars, and facilities/grounds that house
     equipment to support airfield services.
3. Responsibilities
     3.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring an effective program is in place and
     compliant with this instruction for those sections that perform duties on the airfield or in
     aircraft maintenance facilities. Commanders must also ensure that contractors who work on
     the airfield or on aircraft maintenance facilities understand the importance of tool control in
     these areas.
     3.2. Flight chiefs/section NCOICs (or equivalent) determine what tools, equipment, and
     electronic devices fall under the scope of this instruction and will develop a system of
     inventory and control for all items brought out to the airfield or maintenance facilities to
     ensure they are returned to the section upon the completion of the job.
     3.3. Everyone who performs duties on the airfield or in maintenance facilities is responsible
     for safeguarding their equipment against loss by ensuring accountability before and after
     each trip. Lost or missing tool/equipment items within FOD critical areas are reported to the
     work center custodian or supervisor immediately. Organizations should take deliberate
45SWI21-102 5 FEBUARY 2014                                                                       3


   measures to locate missing item(s). If missing item(s) are not located within one hour, the
   supervisor will contact the 45 Operations Support Squadron Airfield Management Operations
   (45 OSS AMOPS) office at 321-494-2222 immediately.
4. Products Available
   4.1. Each non-aircraft maintenance entity that accesses the airfields or its maintenance
   facilities should refer to its governing Air Force Instructions and regulations appropriate to
   its functional discipline when conducting its tool control activities. 45 SW offers up several
   products that could serve as a basis for managing its tool control activities, if the functional
   guidance does not offer an equivalent basis.
   4.2. The Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK) Inventory and Control Log Template is available for
   use to sign tool kits or other equipment out and to document returns to inventory. See
   attachment 2. Each non-aircraft maintenance entity that accesses the airfields may use its
   own functionally prescribed log.
   4.3. An individual that loses a tool or object on the airfields or corresponding maintenance
   facilities must complete a Lost Tool / Object Report. The Lost Tool / Object Report
   Template is available for use in attachment 3. Each non-aircraft maintenance entity that
   accesses the airfields may use its own functionally prescribed Lost Tool / Object Report.
   Supervisors of organizations that lose controlled tools/objects should submit a copy of this
   report to 45 Space Wing Safety office (45 SW/SEF 321-494-2239; 45 SW/SE 321-494-
   2114).
5. Program Elements
   5.1. 45 SW recommends that non-aircraft maintenance entities with access should develop a
   solid tool control program in the context that incorporates the follow elements:
      5.1.1. Master Inventory Listing (MIL): A listing of all items dispatched out. Individual
      tool boxes should include an inventory of all items in that box.
      5.1.2. Daily Inventory Log: Proof of physical accountability of all items on the MIL
      before and after each duty day or shift.
      5.1.3. Sign In/Sign Out Log: Method to show custodial responsibility of items checked
      out for use on the airfield or in maintenance facilities. NOTE: Ideally, a second person
      (if available) should sign in the item upon turn-in.
   5.2. For programs with stricter control, 45 SW recommends that units incorporate the
   following:
      5.2.1. Clearly mark all CTKs/TKs and tools with the EID. The EID will consist of units
      organizational shop code and three digit number. Units place the EID on all CTKs, tools,
      and dispatch-able equipment that is of sufficient size. The EID is placed on the outside
      of dispatch-able CTKs.

    5.2.2. Program continuity book or electronic equivalent: Specific contents are at the
    discretion of the flight chief/section NCOIC (or equivalent), but should include shop
    policy and the MIL.
    5.2.3. For additional guidance refer to AFI 21-101, Chapter 10 and Chapter 1.
