                                              CHAPTER 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. Applicability. All Range Users operating on the AFSPC ranges are subject to the requirements of
this volume to ensure that operations are conducted safely. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
(AFOSH) standards do not apply to contractors or contractor employees except where Air Force person-
nel or property are endangered or if specifically required by the contract.

1.2. Organization of the Volume:
     1.2.1. Main Chapters. The main chapters of this volume include common requirements for all vehi-
     cle classes. Appendixes include additional requirements to supplement the main chapters.
     1.2.2. Open Text. The open text contains the actual mandatory performance-based requirements. The
     only tailoring expected for these requirements would be the deletion of non-applicable requirements.
     For example, solid rocket motor performance requirements would be deleted for launch systems that
     do not use solid rocket motors.
     1.2.3. Bordered Paragraphs:
        1.2.3.1. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
        detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements. In addition, the bordered
        paragraphs contain lessons learned from previous applications of the performance requirement,
        where a certain design may have been found successful, or have been tried and failed to meet the
        requirement. These technical solutions are provided for the following reasons:
            1.2.3.1.1. To aid the tailoring process between Range Safety and Range Users in evaluating a
            potential system against all the performance requirements.
            1.2.3.1.2. To aid Range Safety and Range Users in implementing lessons learned.
            1.2.3.1.3. To provide benchmarks that demonstrate what Range Safety considers an accept-
            able technical solution/implementation of the performance requirement and to help convey the
            level of safety the performance requirement is intended to achieve.
        1.2.3.2. The technical solutions in the bordered paragraphs may be adopted into the tailored ver-
        sion of the requirements for a specific program when the Range User intends to use that solution
        to meet the performance requirement. At this point, they become mandatory requirements to
        obtain Range Safety approval. This process is done to:
            1.2.3.2.1. Provide an appropriate level of detail necessary for contractual efforts and to pro-
            mote efficiency in the design process.
            1.2.3.2.2. Avoid contractual misunderstandings that experience has shown often occur if an
            appropriate level of detail is not agreed to. The level of detail in the bordered paragraphs is
            necessary to avoid costly out-of-scope contractual changes and to prevent inadvertently over-
            looking a critical technical requirement.

   5.6.1. General. Conditions under which launch complexes, launch vehicle and payload assembly
   areas, and other hazardous areas shall be cleared due to a threat of lightning shall be specified in the
   OSP
   5.6.2. ER Lightning Hazard Watches and Hazard Warnings:
      5.6.2.1. Operations that will be allowed during lightning watches and warnings shall be coordi-
      nated, reviewed, and approved by 45 SW/SES and documented in the specific OSP.
      5.6.2.2. Phase I Lightning Watch. For the 5 nautical miles lightning watch (Forecast for lightning
      within 5 nautical miles of centroid of a specific lightning alert area, [Space Launch Complex
      (SLC) and/or facility], expected within some time, usually 30 minutes), the following actions shall
      be taken:
          5.6.2.2.1. SCAPE operations, propellant tanking and detanking, hoisting hazardous materials
          or 1.1 to 1.4 class ordnance, and other hazardous operations that take 30 minutes or longer to
          secure shall not be started.
          5.6.2.2.2. If an operation is in progress, personnel shall begin safing the system so as to have
          the area secured and evacuated, if required, before the forecasted 5 nautical miles lightning
          warning start time.
      5.6.2.3. Phase II Lightning Warning. For the lightning warning, lightning is imminent or occur-
      ring within the 5 nautical mile boundary of a centroid of a specific lightning alert area (SLC and/
      or facility), the following actions shall be taken:
          5.6.2.3.1. All operations shall cease unless they are performed remotely and have been
          approved by either Range Safety or are authorized in the specific OSP.
          5.6.2.3.2. If the Phase I lightning watch has not been previously announced or the 5 nautical
          mile lightning warning start time is earlier than forecast, the operation shall be terminated at
          the safest step and the area secured and evacuated in accordance with the specific OSP.
      5.6.2.4. Due to the differences between launch vehicle configurations and SLCs, evacuation
      requirements shall be specified in each specific OSP. In general, the complex shall be cleared
32                                                                 AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004


        before the 5 nautical mile lightning warning start time whenever a launch vehicle with payload,
        propellants, solid rocket motors, or Class 1.1 to 1.4 ordnance is present or EEDs are electrically
        connected.
        5.6.2.5. Additional information regarding lightning hazard watches and warnings may be found
        in the 45 SW OPLAN 15-1, Weather Operations Plan.
     5.6.3. WR Lightning/Thunderstorm Watches and Warnings. The 30th Weather Squadron issues
     two messages related to lightning/thunderstorms: A watch and a warning.
        5.6.3.1. A Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch is a forecast issued when the potential for lightning/
        -thunderstorms is expected to occur within 10 nautical miles of any location on VAFB. The
        desired lead time for this watch is 2 hours. The watch is forecast for a period of time (valid time)
        that lightning/thunderstorms are expected to be within 10 nautical miles.
        5.6.3.2. A Lightning/Thunderstorm Warning is issued when lightning is observed within 10 nau-
        tical miles of VAFB.
        5.6.3.3. Meteorological and weather warning notification procedures are provided in 30 SWI
        15-101, Weather Support.
        5.6.3.4. Upon issuance of the Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch, all operations involving propellant
        or ordnance activities shall be completed before the start of the Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch
        “valid time.” All propellant or ordnance activities not completed before the watch “valid time,”
        may continue if the facility has a certified lightning protection system and the organization’s com-
        mander grants approval to continue. All other non-propellant or non-ordnance activities may con-
        tinue in the facility during the Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch.
        5.6.3.5. Upon issuance of the Lightning/Thunderstorm Warning, a space launch complex, explo-
        sive/missile processing facility, launch facility, storage facility, or any other hazardous operating
        location that has a certified lightning protection system does not require evacuation; and all
        non-propellant or non-ordnance activities may continue in the facility during the Lightning/Thun-
        der- storm Warning. Exception: If either of the following conditions apply, all personnel shall
        evacuate to at least the public transportation route (PTR) distance regardless of the lightning pro-
        tection system: Condition 1: There is exposed solid propellant. Condition 2: There is an explosive
        initiation device that cannot be placed in a safe configuration.


The intent of 5.6.3.4 and 5.6.3.5 is to allow all non-ordnance and non-propellant activities to continue
in facilities with certified lightning protection systems during a Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch or
Warning. A "certified" lightning protection system is inspected and maintained in accordance with AFI
32-1605 or National Fire Protection Association Standard 780. These are the minimum lightning pro-
tection requirements imposed by 30 SW Safety. Range Users may be more conservative at their own
discretion.

        5.6.3.6. Upon issuance of the Lightning/Thunderstorm Warning, any operation involving propel-
        lant or ordnance activities in a space launch complex, explosive/missile processing facility, launch
        facility, storage facility, or any other hazardous operating location that does not have a certified
        lightning protection system shall evacuate to at least the PTR distance.

       5.6.3.7. If a Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch or Warning has not been previously issued or the
       Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch or Warning “valid time” is earlier than forecast, the propellant or
       ordnance activities shall be terminated at the safest point and the area secured.
       5.6.3.8. Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch and Warning notifications and Range User action
       requirements for propellant or ordnance activities apply to both day-to-day and day-of-launch
       operations.
       5.6.3.9. Range Users working an approved operation involving propellant or ordnance activities
       during a Lightning/Thunderstorm Watch can call 30 WS (x6-8022) to get an update of the status
       of the watch. To ensure the consistent and accurate relay of information, Range Users should des-
       ignate a single point of contact to make these calls, preferably the individual in charge of the oper-
       ation.


Examples of approved activities are installation of electrical cables, mechanical components, flight
hardware, stud standoff, and wing installation. Examples of unapproved activities are handling of
rocket motors or launch vehicles by lifting, mating, or roll transfer; fuel transfer and pressurization; and
ordnance installation and connection.

5.7. Operating Restrictions Due to High Winds:
   5.7.1. For Winds of 18-29 Knots as Measured on or Closest to Specific Facilities. No work shall
   be performed on the exterior surface of umbilical or mobile service towers or other tall structures

                                              CHAPTER 6

  MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT, CRANE AND HOIST, PERSONNEL PLATFORM,
         POWERED INDUSTRIAL TRUCK, AND ELEVATOR OPERATIONS


This chapter is divided into the following: 6.1. Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Operations, 6.2.
Crane and Hoist Operations, 6.3. Personnel Platform Operations, 6.4. Powered Industrial Trucks (See
ANSI B56), and 6.5. Elevator Usage. Requirements for vehicles used to transport hardware onto and off
of the ranges are not governed by this chapter. (See Chapter 15 of this volume.).

6.1. Material Handling Equipment Operations. The operations requirements for material handling
equipment (MHE) used for handling (lifting, supporting, or manipulating) critical and non-critical hard-
ware are described below. These requirements are applicable to new or modified MHE. The requirements
are also applicable to permanent or short-term use MHE and apply whether the equipment is owned,
rented, or leased by the government, contractors, or commercial operators.


MHE is comprised of below-the-hook lifting devices (BTHLD), handling structures, support structures,
slings, load cells, Hydrasets, and rigging hardware.

     6.1.1. MHE Operating Standards:
        6.1.1.1. Existing equipment shall not be used in operations unless it meets all the requirements in
        Volume 3, Chapter 6 unless otherwise agreed to by Range Safety.
        6.1.1.2. All MHE shall be operated, tested, and maintained in accordance with the requirements
        of this publication, AFOSHSTD 91-501, and applicable military and industry standards including,
        but not limited to, ANSI, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and the
        National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).
        6.1.1.3. All equipment used by the Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU) and that has been
        approved by the Chief of Naval Operations, Department of Energy, and the DoD for the specific
        purpose for which it is used shall be considered in compliance with this publication.
        6.1.1.4. All users of MHE used to handle the critical hardware covered in this publication shall
        have written and approved procedures that cover selection, operation, maintenance, and testing of
        the MHE used. Operations that include maintenance of the MHE and use of these items with no
        safety critical or hazardous loads shall not be considered safety critical operations. Those opera-
        tions that involve MHE and safety critical or hazardous loads including direct contact, such as
        supporting the load, or within the immediate vicinity, such as moving the MHE without a load
        over a hazardous commodity, shall be considered hazardous operations. Moving or parking an

           6.2.9.1.13. If the weight of the load to be lifted is not known, the weight shall be estimated
           with a reasonable degree of accuracy before attempting to lift the load.
       6.2.9.2. Attaching the Load. To attach the load, the crane hook shall be positioned directly over
       the center of gravity of the load before attachment unless authorized in a written procedure
       approved by Range Safety.
       6.2.9.3. Lifting the Load:
           6.2.9.3.1. On the first lift of the day or shift, or on a critical lift, the load shall be raised a few
           inches, then held in place momentarily, to verify that the brakes operate normally.
           6.2.9.3.2. The load shall be lifted to a height sufficient to clear all obstacles in its intended
           path.
           6.2.9.3.3. For hoist angles, cranes are designed to function with the load raised perpendicular
           with respect to the ground. Cranes are normally designed for vertical lifts. Side angle pull lifts
           should not be attempted unless the crane is specifically designed for this purpose in accor-
           dance with the requirements in Volume 3
               6.2.9.3.3.1. Fleet (side) angles shall be kept as close to zero as possible. Range Safety
               approval is required for all anticipated fleet angles.


Pulling the rope with a load component perpendicular to the drum or sheave grooves (fleet or side
angle) may cause the rope to jump out of the groove and become entangled on the drum or caught
between the sheave and its mounting with possible catastrophic results.

               6.2.9.3.3.2. Lead (in-line) angles shall be kept as close to zero as possible. Range Safety
               approval is required for anticipated lead angles exceeding 5 degrees unless the hoist is spe-
               cifically designed for greater angles. Increasing the lead (in-line) angle increases the strain
               on the load line, brakes, bearings, sheaves, and other crane parts.
               6.2.9.3.3.3. When lifting a load, load lines shall not contact load girts, structural members,
               or any other obstructions.
               6.2.9.3.3.4. Loads may be lifted with the load line off-perpendicular for the purpose of
               rotating large pieces of hardware if all of the following conditions are met:

           6.2.9.3.4. Loads may be lifted with the load line off-perpendicular for the purpose of rotating
           large pieces of hardware if all of the following conditions are met:
               6.2.9.3.4.1. There is no safer way to accomplish the rotation.
               6.2.9.3.4.2. The angle on the load line shall not exceed 5 degrees unless the hoist was spe-
               cifically designed for a greater angle.


This angle is sometimes referred to as the lead or draft angle; it is not to be confused with the fleet
angle.

               6.2.9.3.4.3. On an installed crane, the angle is pulled in line with the rotation of the rope
               onto the drum (lead angle) unless the crane is equipped with a level wind device.
               6.2.9.3.4.4. The crane is inspected to ensure that the load line does not engage the load
               girts, structural members, or any other obstructions at the angle to be used.
               6.2.9.3.4.5. Before the lift, the crane is checked to ensure that all rope parts are properly
               seated in the grooves of the drums or sheaves.
               6.2.9.3.4.6. The load is prevented from swinging or otherwise inducing dynamic loads on
               the hoisting system.
           6.2.9.3.5. Mobile or boom-equipped cranes shall not be used for off-perpendicular lifting due
           to the severe hazard of tipping the crane over or of collapsing the boom.
           6.2.9.3.6. Crane maintenance instructions or checklists shall include directions to look for
           evidence of apparent side-pull damage during inspections.
     6.2.10. Suspended Load Operations:
        6.2.10.1. Moving a Suspended Load:
           6.2.10.1.1. Crane operations involving lifting of hazardous or explosive materials shall be
           limited to only those personnel required to perform the task.
           6.2.10.1.2. A safety clearance zone shall be established in the vicinity around the load and all
           non-essential personnel cleared to a safe distance.
           6.2.10.1.3. Horizontal and vertical travel speeds shall be kept at a safe level and shall be
           addressed, as appropriate, in procedures.
           6.2.10.1.4. Each lift shall be planned so that the load is suspended for a minimum amount of
           time.
           6.2.10.1.5. The load shall not be lifted until immediately before intended travel.
           6.2.10.1.6. The most direct route of travel shall be used.
           6.2.10.1.7. Loads shall not be carried over critical hardware except when that load is being
           mated to the critical hardware.
           6.2.10.1.8. The landing area shall be prepared so that the load may be set down immediately
           at the end of travel.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                           45


         6.2.10.1.9. If the load remains suspended for any length of time, the safety clearance zone
         shall remain in force.
         6.2.10.1.10. The load shall not be carried over personnel nor shall personnel be allowed to
         place any part of their bodies under any part of the load.
         6.2.10.1.11. The load shall be transported as low as possible but at a height sufficient to clear
         all obstacles that may be in its path.
         6.2.10.1.12. An alarm device or personnel accompanying the load shall be used to clear other
         persons out of the load path.
         6.2.10.1.13. Tag lines shall be used to control movement of the load and not impart undesir-
         able motion to the load.
         6.2.10.1.14. Tag lines shall be long enough to protect personnel from being struck by the load.
         6.2.10.1.15. Tag lines shall be used when there is potential for a load swing that could damage
         flight hardware, property, or cause injury or death.
         6.2.10.1.16. Crane operators shall be instructed to stop motion should anyone be in the path of
         the load or if anyone signals to stop.
      6.2.10.2. Crane-Suspended Personnel Platforms. Operations involving lifting suspended per-
      sonnel platforms are prohibited except as provided by AFOSHSTD 91-501 and 29 CFR 1926.550
      (g), Crane or Derrick Suspended Personnel Platforms, and specifically authorized by Range
      Safety.
      6.2.10.3. Man-Rated Crane Criteria. All cranes used to suspend personnel platforms and work
      baskets shall meet the following requirements:
         6.2.10.3.1. Crane free-fall features shall be deactivated.
         6.2.10.3.2. Load testing of the current configuration shall have been performed within past 12
         months.

        At a minimum, recurring data is required in accordance with Volume 3, Chapter 4.
     6.3.2. Aerial Work Platforms:


Aerial work platforms are commercial (whether or not modified) vehicle-mounted elevating and rotat-
ing aerial devices, manually propelled elevating aerial platforms, boom-supported elevating work plat-
forms, self-propelled elevating work platforms, and airline ground support vehicle-mounted vertical-lift
devices.

        6.3.2.1. Aerial Work Platform Operating Standards. All aerial work platforms shall be veri-
        fied to meet the design and construction standards of ANSI A92.1, Manually Propelled Mobile
        Ladder Stands-Scaffolds, and bear identifying mark(s) evidencing the same.
        6.3.2.2. Aerial Work Platform Designations. All aerial work platforms operated in a hazardous
        environment as defined by NFPA 505, Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks
        Including Type Designations, Areas of Use, Conversions, Maintenance, and Operation, shall be
        approved for fire safety purposes by a nationally recognized testing laboratory (for example,
        Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. [UL], Factory Mutual Engineering Corp [FM]) using nationally
        recognized testing standards, bear mark(s) evidencing testing, and bear the appropriate designa-
        tion (D, DS, DY, E, ES, EE, EX, G, GS, LP, LPS).
        6.3.2.3. Aerial Work Platform Operations:
           6.3.2.3.1. Only qualified and trained personnel shall operate aerial work platforms.
           6.3.2.3.2. Aerial work platforms shall be operated in accordance with the safety rules and
           practices of ANSI B56.2 Type Designated Area, Use Maintenance, Operator, and ANSI
           B56.3, Electric Battery-Powered Industrial Trucks, safety standards.
           6.3.2.3.3. Usage in NFPA 505 Hazardous Area Classifications shall be restricted to aerial
           work platforms with the appropriate designation per UL 558, Standard for Safety, Industrial
           Trucks, Internal Combustion Engine Powered, UL 583, Standard for Safety, Battery Pow-
           ered Industrial Trucks, or comparable nationally recognized testing laboratory.
           6.3.2.3.4. Aerial work platforms shall not be used in proximity of critical hardware where
           inadvertent operation could result in damage of same.


In some cases, aerial work platforms are intentionally used in close proximity to critical hardware; for
example, to disconnect the rigging from the top of solid rocket motor upgrade (SRMU) segments when
they are placed vertically in the stands. A hazard analysis should be conducted on such aerial platforms
and identified hazards mitigated. Examples of mitigation include padded platform handrails, elimina-
tion of single point failures from the hydraulic control system, and stabilization of the chassis to prevent
sudden shifting of the platform in case of tire failure. Lessons learned from the SRMU program are
listed below:
Cont:
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                               47


1. Do not use worn or dry rotted tires on aerial platform vehicles. Sudden tire failure may cause plat-
form translation and impact against sensitive flight hardware.

2. Keep the hydraulic system clean and ensure adequate hydraulic hose chafing guards are installed in
the boom articulated joint areas. At least one hydraulic hose failure occurred on the SRMU program,
spraying the entire lift with hydraulic oil.

3. Ensure that the hydraulic system components have no unacceptable failure modes. In case of an
SRMU aerial platform, reverse command resulted in the vehicle lurching forward and the platform
impacting the doorframe. This malfunction was attributed to contamination in the hydraulic system.

6.4. Powered Industrial Trucks:


Powered industrial trucks are commercial (whether or not modified) fork trucks, platform lift trucks,
crane trucks, tow tractors, personnel and burden carriers, and other specialized industrial trucks pow-
ered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.

        8.1.2.3. AFMAN 91-201, DoD 6055.9-STD, and T.O. 31Z-10-4, Electromagnetic Radiation
        Hazards, for guidance with respect to siting ordnance.
     8.1.3. The use and operating location of non-ionizing radiation producing devices shall be approved
     by Range Safety and the Radiation Protection Officer (RPO).

8.2. Radio Frequency Procedures. All radio frequency (RF) transmitters shall be operated using Range
Safety and RPO approved procedures with the appropriate controls established. 45 SWI 40-201 or 30
SWI 48-102 specifies minimum power levels below which RF transmitters are exempt from controls.

8.3. RF Operations:
     8.3.1. RF Operations General Requirements:


Non-ionizing radiation operations involve RF transmitters in the range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz and optical
devices such as lasers.

        8.3.1.1. Before transmitting, areas in which power density levels exceed permissible exposure
        limits shall be controlled to restrict access.


Area control may be accomplished using appropriate warning signs, lights, and access barriers.

        8.3.1.2. The RPO shall survey RF transmitting devices as required.
            8.3.1.2.1. The Range User or site operator shall comply with the survey recommendations.
            8.3.1.2.2. Where applicable all safety devices shall be checked by site personnel before oper-
            ation to ensure proper function. If transmission is required while performing these checks, the
            tests shall be performed at low output power or with a dummy load.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                              51



A safety device (or feature) is levied on the system design to control the cause of an identified hazard or
to mitigate the effect of a hazard once the cause has been satisfied. As a result, the probability and/or
severity of a hazard can be reduced to an acceptable level. Safety devices (or features) can take numer-
ous forms in a design. No matter what form a safety device (or feature) takes, its purpose is to prevent
an undesirable (hazardous) event from occurring. Safety devices (or features) may be wholly or partly
mechanical, electrical, or software in nature. A safety device (or feature) may inherently be part of the
system or be specifically added to a system. Safety devices (or features) may include the following:

1. Barriers - a physical means to keep personnel away from hazardous energy or to contain/deflect haz-
ardous energy if it were released.

2. Fail-safe design - a design feature in which a system reacts to a failure by switching to or maintaining
a safe operating mode that may include system shutdown.

3. Inhibit - a device that prevents system operation if a predetermined condition is not satisfied.

4. Interlock - a device that may be inserted into the system to prevent system operation (often used in
maintenance).

5. Interrupt - a device that disrupts system operation if a predetermined condition is violated.

6. Redundancy/fault tolerance - the built-in ability of a system to provide continued correct operation
in the presence of a specific number of faults or failures.

7. Special system features - systems or devices, such as fire suppression and hazardous gas detection,
that control and/or warn of system hazards.

       8.3.1.3. All new, modified, or relocated RF transmitters shall be reported to Range Safety and the
       RPO so that potential hazards can be evaluated.
   8.3.2. RF Transmission Operations for EEDs and Open Grain Solid Propellant:
       8.3.2.1. As determined by analyses and tests, local or range-wide RF silence is required during
       periods of EED installation, removal, and electrical connection or disconnection. At a minimum,
       RF silence within the complex or area shall be required.
       8.3.2.2. Radio transmitters shall be kept away from systems with installed EEDs in accordance
       with the guidance found in AFMAN 91-201, Paragraph 2.58.


The 25-foot radio transmission distance requirement is the minimum requirement; however, this
requirement does not take into account situations where EEDs are RF sensitive and leads are
unshielded. Based on the specific radio, ordnance, and area involved, an RF analysis performed in
accordance with MIL-STD-1576 may be provided to Range Safety for consideration to reduce this
requirement.
52                                                                 AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004

     45 SWI 40-201 or 30 SWI 48-102.
     8.4.2. Optical/Laser Operation Personnel Protection Requirements:
        8.4.2.1. Optical/laser operations personnel shall be trained and certified in accordance with 45
        SWI 40-201 or 30 SWI 48-102.
        8.4.2.2. Approved protective eye wear and other PPE shall be worn as required.
     8.4.3. Optical/Laser Procedures. All optical devices and lasers capable of exceeding allowable
     energy levels, as determined by Range Safety, shall be operated using Range Safety and RPO
     approved procedures with the appropriate controls established.
     8.4.4. Optical/Laser Inspection:
        8.4.4.1. Periodic inspections shall be conducted to ensure the laser and controls are in safe work-
        ing condition and are properly protected from potential damage.


Conditions of concern include dangerous light radiation, temperature extremes, shatterable materials,
contaminating gases, cryogenics, high voltage, and X-rays.

        8.4.4.2. Inspection records shall be maintained for the life of the program.
        8.4.4.3. Inspection records shall be available at the request of Range Safety.

                                              CHAPTER 11

   GROUND SUPPORT AND FLIGHT HARDWARE PRESSURE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS


The minimum operational requirements for both ground support and flight hardware pressure systems
operations are described below. Operational requirements unique to either category are identified.

11.1. Pressure Systems Operating Standards:


The degree of hazard in pressure systems is proportional to the amount of energy stored, which is a
function of both the pressure and the volume stored. As a result, low-pressure, high-volume systems can
be as hazardous to personnel as high-pressure systems.

   11.1.1. Only pressure systems that meet the design requirements of Volume 3 as tailored for each spe-
   cific program by Range Safety shall be operated on the ranges.
   11.1.2. The handling and storage of propellants shall be in accordance with CPIA 394, Chemical
   Propulsion Information Agency-Hazards of Chemical Rockets and Propellants, and DoD
   6055.9-STD and subtier documents such as AFMAN 91-201 and NAVSEA OP 5, Ammunition and
   Explosives Ashore: Safety Regulations for Handling, Storing, Production, Renovation and Ship-
   ping.
   11.1.3. Propellants shall be used and stored only in Range Safety approved facilities designed and
   suited for that purpose and only during time periods approved by Range Safety.
   11.1.4. Propellants shall be used and stored only in systems that meet the design requirements of Vol-
   ume 3, Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 and shall be approved by Range Safety.
   11.1.5. Portable or mobile vessels and packaging used for transportation of pressurized or hazardous
   commodities shall be maintained and recertified in accordance with applicable Department of Trans-
   portation (DOT) CFR 49 regulations.
   11.1.6. If a DOT vessel is installed on a permanent basis, it shall fall under the recertification require-
   ments for a fixed system.

11.2. Pressure Systems Personnel Requirements:
   11.2.1. Pressure Systems Training and Certification. All personnel who operate, test, and main-
   tain pressure systems shall be trained and certified.

       is subject to approval by Bioenvironmental Engineering as identified in 5.3.
          11.2.2.1.1. Approval shall be limited to a particular model number of protective equipment
          and a particular operation.
60                                                               AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004


          11.2.2.1.2. Approval of PPE for an operation depends on the type and volume of propellants
          involved, the size of the lines, flow rate, pressure, capability to deal with emergencies, and
          egress accessibility.
          11.2.2.1.3. Approvals are not transferable; approvals for similar operations require a reevalu-
          ation of the parameters stated above.
          11.2.2.1.4. Protective gear shall be compatible with the propellants involved, shall be fire
          resistant, non-static producing, and shall be approved by Range Safety before use.
          11.2.2.1.5. If the protective gear has limitations, these limitations and subsequent protective
          actions shall be identified in the operating procedure.


For example, splash suits are not to be used when hydrazine concentrations can exceed 100 ppm.

      11.2.2.2. SCAPE, Category I or IV:
          11.2.2.2.1. SCAPE, Category I or IV shall be used for propellant flow and pressurization dur-

              11.2.2.2.1.8. When the condition of the system is uncertain or unknown.
          11.2.2.2.2. The maximum operating time in a Category I SCAPE suit is 110 minutes; how-
          ever, Range Safety or Pad Safety can authorize on-station time not to exceed 120 minutes. In
          extreme temperatures, Range Safety or Pad Safety can restrict on-station times in Category I
          SCAPE suits to less than 110 minutes. (ER Only) Personnel using Category I SCAPE suits
          shall observe a 60-minute rest period between consecutive SCAPE operations; for example, no
          double-packing.
          11.2.2.2.3. For physiological purposes, the maximum operating time in a Category IV or VI
          SCAPE suit shall not exceed 4 hours at one time.
      11.2.2.3. Splash Suits. Splash suits, with self-contained breathing apparatus, shall only be used
      with systems that contain residual vapors and only after Range Safety approval. If any liquid is in
      the system, splash suits shall not be used.

   11.5.5. Handling Leaks and Spills of Liquid Propellant:
       11.5.5.1. PPE for Treating Spills. Personnel treating or flushing major spills of toxic and corro-
       sive propellants shall wear the proper protective clothing and equipment.
       11.5.5.2. Leak and Spill Procedures:
           11.5.5.2.1. Range Users and supporting agencies shall develop procedures for handling major
           and minor leaks and spills. CCAFS Cape Support (ER) or Wing Operations Control Center
           (WOCC) (WR) shall be notified of any spill or release of hazardous material.
           11.5.5.2.2. Each area that contains liquid propellants shall have a Range Safety approved plan
           for evacuation based on spill size (quantity and surface area). At the ER, an evacuation zone
           for a small spill (for example, a gallon of hypergolic propellant) is typically 700 feet down-
           wind or more and approximately 200 feet radially if the spill is allowed to spread out on a flat
           surface. At the WR, required evacuations are 2,000 feet upwind or as published in the OSPs
           and Toxic Hazard Zones (THZs).
              11.5.5.2.2.1. The approved evacuation plan shall describe the localized safety clearance
              zone, the general support (larger) safety clearance zone, and the minimum downwind sec-
              tor to be evacuated in the case of a large spill.
              11.5.5.2.2.2. The downwind sector shall be based on the following factors:
                  11.5.5.2.2.2.1. Maximum source strength based on quantity (gallon or pound) and sur-
                  face area. The Range User shall determine a worst case spill (quantity) based on a fail-
                  ure analysis.
                  11.5.5.2.2.2.2. Maximum vapor concentration acceptable for personnel exposure.
                  11.5.5.2.2.2.3. Average weather criteria, such as wind direction, wind speed, tempera-
                  ture, temperature lapse rate.


Weather variables can be obtained from the Range Weather Officer.

           11.5.5.2.3. These procedures shall be in accordance with the applicable OSP and shall be sub-
           mitted to Range Safety for review and approval.
           11.5.5.2.4. Procedures shall address the topics covered in 10.7.
       11.5.5.3. Handling Minor Leaks or Spills:
           11.5.5.3.1. Minor leaks or spills shall be cleaned up with absorbent material where possible.


For safety and hardware protection reasons, certain spills may require the spill to be washed or flushed
with water into collecting tanks or holding basins and disposed of properly to prevent ecological or
health hazards. See CPIA 394 for information on treating spills.

           11.5.5.3.2. Pad Safety shall be notified of minor leaks and spills and subsequent actions.


See CPIA 394 and Range Safety for guidance on disposal of toxic or corrosive propellants.

              mation to assist them.
              11.5.5.4.2.6. All personnel shall report to the supervisor at the designated assembly point
              for head count.
      11.5.5.5. Handling Cryogenic or Toxic Liquid Spills:
          11.5.5.5.1. Spills of cryogenic liquids shall be flushed with large amounts of water into the
          surrounding ground surface or a holding basin.
          11.5.5.5.2. Spills of toxic or corrosive propellant, or those that could affect the public health
          or ecology, shall be flushed with water or another neutralizing agent into a collecting tank to
          be disposed of in accordance with approved procedures.

      requirements described in Volume 3 of this publication shall be operated on AFSPC ranges.
          11.5.5.6.1. If COPVs that contain inert pressurants are in close proximity to propellant tanks,
          the Range User shall provide test data proving that the composite overwrap is compatible with
          the propellant in terms of strength degradation, flammability, and ignition/combustion require-
          ments, when personnel are at risk. If this data is not available, the following actions shall be
          accomplished:
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                       73


          11.5.5.6.1.1. Verification that the COPV is not in a credible "drip zone" for liquid propel-
          lants during ground processing operations.
          11.5.5.6.1.2. If the COPV is in a credible "drip zone", the COPV shall be protected with a
          coating and/or covers and/or splash shields to guard against contact with potentially
          incompatible liquids.
          11.5.5.6.1.3. Hazardous vapor detectors shall be used to monitor the propellant tanks.
       11.5.5.6.2. If COPVs will be pressurized to pressures greater than 1/3 of the COPV design
       burst pressure on AFSPC ranges, the pressurization shall be performed remotely or a blast
       shield shall be used to protect personnel. If the vessel is to remain pressurized, personnel
       access shall not be permitted for a minimum of 10 minutes after the pressurization is com-
       pleted.
       11.5.5.6.3. Personnel limits for each operation on or near a pressurized COPV/spacecraft shall
       be established to minimize personnel exposure to pressurized COPVs.
       11.5.5.6.4. The transport of pressurized COPVs shall only occur on Range Safety approved
       routes that minimize personnel and facility exposure. In addition, pressurized COPV transport
       shall utilize escorts and shall only occur during Range Safety approved and designated time
       periods.
       11.5.5.6.5. COPVS shall be protected from damage due to impacts during manufacturing,
       handling, transportation, assembly, and integration of COPVs into the Range User's system(s).

       13.3.1.1. Personnel handling, installing, or electrically connecting ordnance or working within 10
       feet of exposed, solid propellant grain shall wear Range Safety approved, flame-retardant,
       non-static producing, long-sleeve, cuffless, full-body garments (coveralls) with leg stats, or con-
       ductive shoes, and/or wrist stats. If required, Range Users shall submit a sample of the garment for
       testing.


Ordnance Systems Grounding PPE Criteria:

1. The two primary concerns in selecting garments to be worn by personnel handling, installing, or elec-
trically connecting ordnance or working within 10 feet of exposed, solid propellant grain are static and
fire. The static concern is self-explanatory. Anti-static smocks may be approved by Range Safety if there
is no significant fire hazard. Fire is a primary concern because of the potential for solid/liquid propellant
fires. This concern dates back to the X-248 solid motor mishap in the spin test facility at the ER in 1964.
Although the most probable cause for this mishap was static electricity, it was observed the survivors of
the mishap would have fared much better had they been wearing full-body protection; in other words,
coveralls, rather than smocks. Another key piece of information is the fact that the inadvertent motor ini-
tiation occurred during a non-hazardous operation.

2. With the transition of the Air Force and NASA expendable launch programs to the Space Shuttle pro-
gram in the early 1980s, many activities involved both agencies from a launch vehicle, facility, or per-
sonnel point of view. It became increasingly more difficult for safety personnel to ascertain the
acceptability of the coveralls being used, particularly with respect to Air Force operations in the Payload
Changeout (clean) Room on NASA/KSC's shuttle launch pad. For that reason, the ER Safety Office
joined forces with the KSC Safety Office to develop common standards and specifications for coveralls
for both non-cleanroom and cleanroom environments. The standardized requirements were documented
in the KSC Ground Operations Safety Plan GP 1098, a publication that has since been superceded by
other documents. The following guidance on the selection of coveralls is provided for Range Users:

3. General Criteria for Coveralls:

a. Flame Retardant. Cotton garments meeting the Range Safety flame retardant requirements should
meet the requirements of MIL-C-43122G, Cloth, Sateen, Cotton, Flame Retardant Treated: "finished
cloth shall have an average time of after-flame of not more than 2.0 seconds, and not more than 40%
consumed both initially and following 15 launderings." Per NHB 8060.1B, Flammability, Odor, and
Offgassing Requirements and Test Procedures for Materials in Environments that Support Combus-
tion, Test 1: "less than 6 inches sample consumed and no sparking, sputtering, or dripping of flaming
particles."

NOTE: NOMEX garments are not covered by MIL-C-43122F.

b. Thermal Protection. Garments used in solid rocket motor open grain and Category A ordnance oper-
ations should provide a measure of radiant heat and flame contact protection where practical. See Aero-
space Medicine, Volume 40, Number 11, Method and Rating System for Evaluation of Thermal
Protection, November 1969. NASA/KSC blue-collar garments have been tested for thermal protection
(Naval Air Development Center technical memorandum, 6 March 1979) and provide greater than 14
seconds radiation protection before skin blister at a brightness temperature of 1900oC and greater than 3
seconds flame contact protection before skin blister at a flame temperature of 1220oC.

c. Static Dissipation. Garments meet the Range Safety static dissipation requirement when voltage
drops below 350 volts in 5 seconds at 45 plus 5 percent relative humidity (maximum) and 75oF temper-
ature (maximum). See NFPA 77, Recommended Practices on Static Electricity or NASA KSC Materi-
als Testing Branch Report MMA-1985-79, Standard Test Method for Evaluating Triboelectric Charge
Generation and Decay.

d. Rescue. Consideration should be given to rescue of personnel during hazardous operations. Rescue
aids can usually be applied external to the garments in general use applications. However, because of
frequent confining work, rescue straps are mandatory for cleanroom garments used for hazardous oper-
ations.

AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                               79


e. Sleeves/Legs. Coveralls should contain full-length sleeves and legs; frocks should contain full-length
sleeves.

f. Pockets. Pockets, if any, should be lattice type, arranged not to trap hazardous fluids.
g. Cuffs. Garments should not have cuffs (hazardous fluids must not be trapped).

h. Fasteners. Fasteners should be protected from contact (burning) with the skin.

i. Color. Garments should be white or natural in color to take advantage of flame/heat reflectivity.

4. Detailed Criteria for Non-Cleanroom Coveralls. In addition to meeting general criteria, non-clean-
room coveralls used in ordnance facilities/operations should meet the following:

a. Garments should be readily identifiable as meeting Range Safety requirements:

(1) Approved general-use, NASA/KSC hazardous operation coveralls are identified by blue collars.

(2) Aramid (NOMEX) garments containing 1 percent (minimum) filament wire "Brunsmet" or "Beki-
nox" or carbon thread in one-quarter inch raised grid pattern (carbon grid suits) are approved. (Carbon
thread garments are identified by green rescue straps per Paragraph. 2.16.1.3.d in MIL-C-43122F.)

(3) Aramid (NOMEX) garments (non-carbon grid suits) dipped with a Range Safety-approved
anti-static solution, such as Ethoquad, subject to periodic checks to ensure the anti-static solution
remains active, can be used and should be stenciled "KSC Safety Approved."

NOTE: Range Safety prefers that Range Users acquire white blue-collar coveralls per the KSC specifi-
cation because the coveralls are known to meet requirements and are readily recognizable. Often the
available data on other coveralls is insufficient to determine static resistant and/or fire retardant accept-
ability. In these cases, a sample set of coveralls needs to be provided to Range Safety for testing by the
KSC Materials Laboratory.
b. Coveralls should be properly cleaned to comply with the manufacturer instructions.

5. Detailed Criteria for Cleanroom Coveralls. In addition to meeting the general criteria, cleanroom cov-
eralls used in ordnance facilities/operations should meet the following:

a. The maximum permissible concentration of particles and fibers should not exceed 2,000 particles per
square foot of 5 microns and larger, with a maximum of 25 fibers. See ASTM F51-68, Standard Method
for Sizing and Counting Particulate Contaminant In and On Cleanroom Garments, (1984), U.S. Air
Force Technical Order T.O.-00-25-203, Contamination Control of Aerospace Facilities, and Johnson
Space Center JSCM 5322, Contamination Control Requirements Manual.
80                                                                  AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004


NOTE: Blue-collar garments should not be used for cleanroom use.

b. Garments should be readily identifiable as meeting Range Safety requirements.

(1) Approved cleanroom coveralls used in hazardous operations are identifiable in that they are 99 per-
cent continuous filament NOMEX with approximately 1 percent conductive nylon filament yarn (carbon
impregnated) arranged in a one-half inch raised grid pattern (carbon grid suits).

(2) Continuous filament Aramid (NOMEX) garments dipped with a Range Safety-approved anti-static
solution such as Ethoquad, subject to periodic checks to ensure the anti-static solution remains active,
are approved and should be stenciled "KSC Safety Approved" or "Range Safety Approved" (non-carbon
grid suits).

c. Non-metallic ("Deleren" or equal) zippers should be used on garments in lieu of buttons/snaps in the
vicinity of flight hardware where the loss of a button/snap is a concern.

d. When rescue provisions are applicable, green NOMEX parachute grab straps suitable for rescue pur-
poses should be provided on the legs, shoulders, torso, and back of the garment. Straps should withstand
a pull of 200 pounds. Grab straps should be tacked down by breakaway stitching at the center of the
strap length to prevent the strap catching on objects while the garment is being worn.

 NOTE: In Air Force contractor-operated cleanroom facilities, facility users are expected to use clean-
room coveralls provided by the Air Force facility operator. Besides the fact that (1) it took a long time to
develop the currently approved (carbon-grid) cleanroom coveralls and (2) gaining approval for a new
type of coverall could be difficult, logistical considerations are involved. For example, a facility evacu-
ation typically requires the facility user to exit the facility to the outside thereby invalidating the clean-
room garments that are worn. Additionally, it is easier for a facility operator to maintain the necessary
inventory for replacement garments rather than a facility user. It is strongly recommended that non-Air
Force contractor-managed cleanroom facilities use cleanroom garments that meet the NASA/KSC spec-
ifications.
       13.3.1.2. Other persons who may come in contact with ordnance, test equipment when ordnance
       is connected, or flight hardware when ordnance connections are not complete shall wear the same
       coveralls and equipment as described in 13.3.1.1 or as required in procedures specific to the sub-
       ject equipment and operations.
       13.3.1.3. Sweaters and jackets shall not be worn as outer garments over protective coveralls.
       13.3.1.4. When solid and/or liquid propellants are present, smocks shall not be used as a substi-
       tute for full body protection (coveralls).
       13.3.1.5. More stringent controls shall be used when necessary to enforce Range Safety policy.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                           81



Range Safety has the option to invoke more stringent controls regarding PPE when necessary to enforce
Range Safety policy. For example, all personnel entering a particular control area may be required to
wear the proper coveralls.

     13.4.4.3. Ordnance No Voltage Checks:
        13.4.4.3.1. Before any ordnance electrical connection, no voltage (stray voltage) checks shall
        be performed on all launch vehicle and payload ordnance electrical connectors.
        13.4.4.3.2. These checks shall be made first with power on, then with power off, and include
        all pin-to-pin and pin-to-case combinations.
        13.4.4.3.3. The power on configuration requires the launch vehicle to be powered up in
        launch configuration. This configuration also requires the payload and upper stage to be pow-
        ered (along with the launch vehicle) unless the payload does not have any electrical interfaces
        with the upper stage.
        13.4.4.3.4. The power on check shall be performed anytime in the launch.
        13.4.4.3.5. The power off configuration requires the launch vehicle and payload to be pow-
        ered down.
        13.4.4.3.6. Power off checks shall be made immediately before ordnance electrical connec-
        tion.
        13.4.4.3.7. If a number of connections must be made in the same general area of the launch
        vehicle and payload, power off checks shall be made on all of the connectors before ordnance
        electrical connection. These connections shall be made before any electrical configuration or
        system changes such as bringing power back up occur.
        13.4.4.3.8. Shielding caps shall not be removed from EEDs until electrical connection to the
        ordnance is to be made.
        13.4.4.3.9. The resulting measured signal (current, voltage, power, energy) from a no voltage
        check shall not be capable of producing a current greater than 20 dB below the no-fire current
        of the EED. The no voltage test procedure shall specify the maximum acceptable reading.
        13.4.4.3.10. Meters that are used for no voltage checks shall have a valid calibration seal.
        13.4.4.3.11. The integrity of the meter and test leads shall be verified before use. Fixed- or
        facility-test instrumentation that is used in place of portable GSE shall have a procedure that
        verifies the integrity of the system. A copy of the completed procedure shall be provided to
        Pad Safety.
  13.4.5. Ordnance Operating Requirements:
     13.4.5.1. Ordnance operations shall not be conducted when the relative humidity is less than 35

Static Charge Risk Assessment. The static charge risk assessment should address the extent of low
humidity conditions, any plastic or other materials being used such as contamination covers, the propel-
lant/ordnance that is part of the planned task, and the potential of the activity to build up static electricity
and create a hazardous electrostatic discharge situation. The risk assessment should also include a dis-
cussion of the hazard controls used, such as equipment grounding, personnel grounding, static meter
scans, and static dissipation methods. It should be noted that "approved" plastic materials are considered
"anti-static" based on testing at 30 percent humidity; therefore, the use of such materials where the
humidity is less than 30 percent is cause for concern.

        13.4.5.2. Ordnance operations shall be conducted in facilities and/or locations specifically
        approved by the DDESB and/or Range Safety. Such approvals shall be accomplished by explo-
        sives site plans or facility licenses. Range Safety shall determine the appropriate approval.
        13.4.5.3. At the ER, ordnance items shall not be handled, installed, or electrically connected when
        the passage of an electrical storm is imminent (within 5 nautical miles). Operations Safety Plans
        shall identify the procedures to be followed for different configurations. At the WR, the guidance
        provided in 5.6.3 shall be followed.
        13.4.5.4. Ordnance items, particularly Category A initiators, shall be installed and electrically
        connected as late in processing flow as practical.

        devices (S&As) after installation and erection on the launch pad but before final connection to the
        ordnance train. This test shall be performed using the launch day system configuration for cycling
        the S&A.


Launch day system configuration for performing a rotation test on S&As includes items such as monitor
circuitry, power sources, and circuits for cycling the S&A.

        13.4.5.6. The ordnance train shall be disconnected from the S&A output during all checkout oper-
        ations except during the following circumstances:
           13.4.5.6.1. Single complete rotation test (safe to arm to safe).
           13.4.5.6.2. Final rotation to arm on the last day of the count.
        13.4.5.7. When the S&A is rotated on the pad, all personnel shall be cleared to an area designated
        in the OSP.
        13.4.5.8. EMI testing shall not be conducted with initiators installed on the vehicle or payload
        without Range Safety approval.
     13.4.6. Laser Initiated Ordnance Operations Personnel Access Criteria:

        14.1.2.2. Explosives and Propellants Not Covered in NEC Article 500. For range installa-
        tions, the following paragraphs define the minimum requirements to be applied in the definitions
        of locations in which explosives, pyrotechnics, or propellants are present or are expected to be
        present. These requirements shall be followed unless less stringent classifications are justified and
        approved as part of the design data submittal process. Range Safety and the Fire Marshal shall
        approve all potential critical facility hazardous location designations. (See Attachment 3 of Vol-
        ume 3 for a flowpath for classifying hazardous areas.)
           14.1.2.2.1. Class I, Division 1. Complete definitions of classified locations are found in
           NFPA 70. These include the following locations:
               14.1.2.2.1.1. Within 25 feet of any vent opening unless the discharge is normally inciner-
               ated or scrubbed to nonflammable conditions [less than 25 percent of Lower Explosive
               Limit (LEL)]. This distance may be increased if the vent flow rate creates a flammability
               concern at a distance greater than 25 feet.
               14.1.2.2.1.2. Below grade locations in a Class II, Division 1 area.
               14.1.2.2.1.3. Locations in which flammable liquids, vapors, or gases may be present in the
               air during normal operations.

Class II, Division 1 usually includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or flammable gases or
vapors are used but, in the judgment of Range Safety and the Fire Marshal, would become hazardous
only in case of an accident or of some unusual operating condition. The quantity of flammable material
that might escape in case of an accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, and the total area
involved are all factors that merit consideration in determining the classification and extent of each loca-
tion.

               14.1.2.2.2.1. Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices would not ordi-
               narily introduce a hazardous condition even though used for flammable liquids or gases.
               Locations used for the storage of flammable liquids or of liquefied or compressed gases in
               sealed containers would not normally be considered hazardous unless also subject to other
               hazardous conditions.
               14.1.2.2.2.2. As determined by Range Safety and the Fire Marshal, locations may actively
               change classification depending on the flammable fluid system activity and configuration.
               For these types of locations, fixed or permanently installed electrical equipment shall be
               designed for the worst case hazardous environment.
               14.1.2.2.2.3. Portable electrical equipment shall be designed for the worst case hazardous
               environment in which it will be used. Portable equipment that is not designed for use in a
               particular hazardous environment is not allowed in that environment.
               14.1.2.2.2.4. Class II, Division 1 locations include the following equipment or areas:
                   14.1.2.2.2.4.1. Storage vessels (including carts and drums). 25 feet horizontally and
                   below to grade and 4 feet vertically above the vessel (25 feet in any direction for
                   hydrogen).
                   14.1.2.2.2.4.2. Transfer lines. 25 feet horizontally and below to grade and 4 feet above
                   the line (25 feet in any direction for hydrogen).

                   radius horizontally from and 25 feet vertically above (100 feet for hydrogen) the high-
                   est leak or vent source and below the vehicle to grade.
                   14.1.2.2.2.4.4. Enclosed locations such as rooms, work bays, and launch complex
                   clean rooms that are used to store and handle flammable and combustible propellants
                   when the concentration of vapors inside the room resulting from a release of all fluids
                   stored and handled equals or exceeds the LEL. The quantity of fluids used in the anal-
                   ysis to determine vapor concentration shall be the maximum amount allowed in the
                   explosives site plan.
                   14.1.2.2.2.4.5. Locations adjacent to a Class I, Division 1 location into which ignitable
                   concentrations of gases or vapors might occasionally be communicated, unless com-
                   munication is prevented by adequate positive pressure ventilation from a source of
                   clean air and effective safeguards against ventilation failure are provided.
           14.1.2.2.3. Hazardous Commodity Groups. Hazardous commodities are grouped by similar
           characteristics.

                                                 CHAPTER 18

         SOLID ROCKET MOTORS AND ROCKET MOTOR SEGMENTS OPERATIONS

18.1. Solid Rocket Motors And Rocket Motor Segments Operations General Requirements. I n
addition to the requirements of Chapter 3 and Chapter 13 of this volume, the Range User shall comply
with the following requirements for operations involving solid rocket motors and rocket motor segments.

18.2. Solid Rocket Motor and Rocket Motor Segment Transportation:
      18.2.1. Solid rocket motor segments/motors transported on trailers or railroad cars shall be properly
      restrained to the trailer or railroad car support structures to minimize possibility of loss of load in an
      accident scenario.
      18.2.2. For solid rocket motor/segment transporting trailers or railroad cars that use internal combus-
      tion engine powered generators for the environmental control units, gasoline or liquid propane gas
      powered engines shall not be used. If internal combustion engine generator equipped trailers or rail-
      road cars loaded with solid rocket motors/segments are brought inside processing facilities, care shall
      be taken to minimize the quantity of fuel in the generator tanks. The fuel tanks shall be reinforced and
      equipped with a protective shield to minimize possibility of tank rupture and fuel ignition during
      transport. An insulation barrier shall be provided between the environmental control unit and the solid
      rocket motor or motor segment to protect the motor from heat or possible fuel fire.


Diesel powered generators are preferred due to much lower flammability of the diesel fuel.

      18.2.3. If forced air heaters are used for environmental control on covered railroad cars or trailers
      transporting solid rocket motors/segments, liquid propane gas heaters or gasoline heaters shall not be
      used. The effects of heater failures on the trailer/railroad car shall be analyzed and reported in an anal-
      ysis as required by Volume 3, 18.3.
      18.2.4. Canvas covers for solid rocket motor/segment transporting trailers or railroad cars shall not be
      used. If their use cannot be avoided, the rubberized canvas material shall be subjected to triboelectric
      testing and meet the test requirements for plastic materials used in solid rocket motor/segment pro-
      cessing. An operational hazard analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that under the worst case
      conditions (for example, broken or loose canvas tie downs and canvas flapping and rubbing on the
      segment or motor case), not enough static can be accumulated to cause a catastrophic event, such as
      propellant ignition).
      18.2.5. Solid rocket motor/segment transport trailers or railroad cars containing solid rocket motors/
      segments shall be secured to prevent inadvertent motion when parked; in other words, brakes set and
      wheels chocked.
      18.2.6. Locomotives and tractors that transport solid rocket motor/segment cars and trailers shall be
      removed from processing facilities as soon as possible.
      18.2.7. If air pallets are used for transport of solid rocket motors/segments inside processing facili-
      ties, the structure of the air pallet shall be rigid enough to minimize elastic deformation of the pallet
      under load and, thus, minimize stresses transferred to the solid rocket motor/segment.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                              107



Due to the strict requirements for floor surfaces required for such air pallet operation and the fact that
such surfaces are easily damaged, extensive use of air pallets for solid rocket motor/segment transport is
not recommended.

18.3. Solid Rocket Motor and Rocket Motor Segment Inspections:
   18.3.1. If wetting of a solid rocket motor/segment with water is required for ultrasonic inspections,
   adequate water intrusion barriers shall be provided to prevent the propellant from getting wet.


The wetting of propellant surfaces with water could result in precipitation of ammonium perchlorate
crystals on the propellant surface and possibly increase propellant sensitivity.

   18.3.2. Solid rocket motors/segments with graphite epoxy casings, which are very sensitive to exter-
   nal damage, shall be visually inspected for case damage at each major stage of processing and upon
   arrival at the launch pad.


Protective measures, such as blankets, should be used to shield solid rocket motors/segments from dam-
age during transport and storage where practical.

   18.3.3. For igniter uncrating and inspection operations of separately shipped igniters, corrosion pro-
   tection coatings shall be removed from the igniter metal flange before special lifting adapters are
   attached to the flange.


Failure to remove the coatings may cause the lifting adapter to stick to the igniter flange, possibly result-
ing in the igniter being lifted after the adaptor bolts have been removed when attempting to remove the
unsecured adaptor. This may result in the igniter being raised and dropped into its crate.

   18.3.4. Extreme care shall be taken when inspecting and handling igniters.


Igniter propellant contains a higher percentage of oxidizer than regular motor propellant and is very
energetic.

   18.3.5. Fixtures using cradles for the storage and handling of solid rocket motors/segments shall be
   inspected for cleanliness and the absence of any objects that could damage the sensitive solid rocket
   motor/segment cases when they are lowered into the cradles.
   18.3.6. For open grain inspections, wrist stats shall be used within 5 feet of the open grain.

18.4. Solid Rocket Motor and Rocket Motor Segment Processing and Handling:
   18.4.1. Solid Rocket Motor and Rocket Motor Segment Processing and Handling General
   Requirements:
108                                                               AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004


      18.4.1.1. Pathfinder operations using size and weight representative of inert solid rocket motors/
      segments shall be conducted before live/operational solid rocket motor/segment processing oper-
      ations are conducted.
      18.4.1.2. For solid rocket motor/segment lifting operations, main processing facility overhead
      doors shall be kept at least partially open, weather permitting, to provide additional exit routes,
      unless the doors are required to be closed to reduce exposure of additional personnel.
      18.4.1.3. If rotating fixtures are used to rotate solid rocket motors/segments (for purposes of cork
      installation, for example), the rotating fixture cradles shall be equipped with a means to restrain
      the solid rocket motors/segments during rotation.


A hydraulic powered rotating mechanism is preferred.

      18.4.1.4. If internal combustion powered vehicles, such as forklifts or man lifts, are required for
      support of solid rocket motor/segment handling operations and are operated in close proximity of
      the solid rocket motors/segments, gasoline and liquid propane gas powered equipment shall not be
      used. The equipment shall be located no less than 25 feet from the solid rocket motors/segments
      and at least 100 feet away when being refueled. If a forklift is used as a hoist in close proximity of
      a solid rocket motor/segment OSHA approved fork lifting adapters shall be used.


Battery powered equipment is preferred.

      18.4.1.5. All tapes and plastic materials used around open grain areas of a solid rocket motor/seg-
      ment shall be subjected to triboelectric and flammability testing and be listed on
      NASA-STD-6001, Flammability, Odor, Offgassing, and Compatibility Requirements and Test
      Procedures for Materials in Environments that Support Combustion, and/or KTI-5212, Mate-
      rial Selection List for Plastic Films, Foams, and Adhesive Tapes.
      18.4.1.6. For joint cleaning operations, where solid rocket motors/segments are placed on ele-
      vated adaptors, extreme care shall be taken to ensure that such adaptors are properly attached to
      the support structures. If solid rocket motors/segments are suspended from a crane during such
      operations, at least 50 percent of the solid rocket motor/segment weight shall be supported by the
      crane.
      18.4.1.7. An operations safety plan shall be written for each solid rocket motor/segment process-
      ing facility. This plan shall define the required clearance areas for all hazardous operations.
      18.4.1.8. .Solid rocket motor/segment processing facilities shall be kept clean and uncluttered at
      all times. Separate facilities for storage of support equipment and receiving and uncrating of flight
      hardware shall be used, as necessary, to maintain unobstructed access to exits at all times. Ship-
      ping containers shall be removed from the processing facility immediately as soon as possible
      after unpacking the hardware.
      18.4.1.9. Solid rocket motor/segment processing facilities shall not be used for storage of ground
      support equipment or flight hardware belonging to other programs or not related or not needed for
      the solid rocket motor/segment handling operations.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                              109


       18.4.1.10. Solid rocket motor/segment processing and storage facilities containing ordnance shall
       not be used as emergency garage facilities for motor vehicles; for example, storing these vehicles
       next to stored solid rocket motors/segments before an earthquake, tropical storm, or a hurricane.
       18.4.1.11. An unobstructed access to at least two exits in the processing facility shall be main-
       tained at all times during solid rocket motor/segment handling operations.
       18.4.1.12. Breakout gates shall be provided in the processing facility perimeter fence to enable
       speedy evacuation in case of emergency. The number and location of the gates shall be based on
       worst case conditions (facility population, facility configuration, and meteorological conditions)
       and shall be approved by Range Safety.
       18.4.1.13. Waste collection dumpsters shall not be located inside solid rocket motor/segment pro-
       cessing and storage facilities.
       18.4.1.14. Combustible materials, such as lumber and dunnage used in support of rocket segment/
       motor handling operations, shall be treated with flame retardant paint. Bulk stacks of combustible
       materials shall be no closer than 100 feet from the solid rocket motors/segments and removed
       from the facility as soon as possible.
       18.4.1.15. Flammable materials needed for processing of solid rocket motors/segments shall be
       stored in Range Safety approved lockers and used in minimum necessary quantities around the
       solid rocket motors/segments. Waste, such as degreaser or oil soaked rags, shall be placed in
       closed Range Safety approved metal containers and the containers shall be emptied at the end of
       every shift. Due to the possibility of spontaneous fires, contaminated waste material shall be
       removed from the facility as soon as possible and, in no case, left unattended overnight. Waste col-
       lection metal containers shall be placed no closer than 25 feet from the solid rocket motor seg-
       ments/motors.
       18.4.1.16. Complete solid rocket motors that are capable of unguided flight upon ignition (as
       determined by analysis) that are stored vertically or horizontally shall be restrained or thrust termi-
       nation devices shall be provided to prevent fly-aways.


Vertical storage of built-up rocket motors is undesirable unless they are mated to the core vehicle.

       18.4.1.17. When built-up solid rocket motors must be stored vertically in the stands, provisions
       shall be made to protect the motor nozzles from external facility fires. The motors shall be
       restrained in the stands to ensure that they will not topple in case of an earthquake, tornado, high
       winds, or a hurricane impacting the facility, or some other mishap in the facility.


For example, a separation wall could be built between the processing area and the stand.

       18.4.1.18. 18.4.1.18.If desiccant cartridges are used in the stored solid rocket motor/segment cov-
       ers, provisions shall be made for their periodic replacement.
       18.4.1.19. For large vertically stacked solid rocket motor igniter installations, the bore opening on
       top of the motor shall be guarded to prevent personnel from falling into the motor bore.
   18.4.2. Grounding and Open Grain Work:
110                                                                  AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004


         18.4.2.1. All solid rocket motors/segments and built-up motors shall be grounded at all times.
         When solid rocket motor segments and built-up motors are in storage stands or fixtures, the resis-
         tance to ground shall not exceed 10 ohms. When moving the solid rocket motors/segments,
         make-before-break technique shall be applied. The new ground wire shall be connected to ground
         and the resistance verified.
         18.4.2.2. If a solid rocket motor/segment and/or built-up motor is found ungrounded for any rea-
         son (for example, the grounding wire is disconnected), the ground wire shall be immediately
         reconnected, the ground verified, and a static meter shall be used to measure the voltage on the
         case surface. The voltage shall be 1,000 V or less before the solid rocket motor/segment can be
         worked on or moved from its storage stand or fixture. Grounding shall be accomplished in the
         manner that attaches the grounding wire to the ordnance item first and then to the facility ground
         (away from the ordnance) last.
         18.4.2.3. For open grain work, wriststats shall be used within 5 feet of the open grain. Electrically
         powered equipment used within 10 feet of the open grain shall be explosion proof or designed to
         be intrinsically safe.
      18.4.3. Solid Rocket Motor and Rocket Motor Segment Processing and Handling Crane Opera-
      tions:
         18.4.3.1. If lifting of rocket motors/segments with cranes is required, the height of such lifts shall
         be kept to the absolute required minimum and below the propellant ignition threshold. For those
         lifts where the lift height must exceed the propellant ignition threshold, detailed justification data
         shall be submitted to Range Safety for review and approval.
         18.4.3.2. A clear area shall be established around each lift to ensure that the solid rocket motor/
         segment will not impact a sharp object in case of crane or rigging failure.


Sharp object impalement may reduce the ignition threshold of propellant by a factor of two.

         18.4.3.3. Lifting of solid rocket motors/segments over other motors or flight hardware shall be
         avoided except where necessary for stacking or storing operations.
         18.4.3.4. The number of spotters and personnel required to support the solid rocket motor/seg-
         ment lift operations shall be kept to the absolute minimum required. Remote cameras or similar
         devices shall be used in locations where NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, requirements for evacuation
         of personnel from high hazard facilities cannot be met.
         18.4.3.5. Proposed breakover operations of solid rocket motors/segments shall be submitted to
         Range Safety with substantiation that there is no other practical means to accomplish the task. The
         data shall illustrate how risks are minimized and managed. A detailed operational hazard analysis
         is required.


The cranes shall be designed for breakover operations in accordance with 3.6 and the heights of the lift
kept to the absolute minimum required.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                           111


       18.4.3.6. Crane hoisting operations that involve lifting large stacked solid rocket motors are not
       recommended due to the extreme hazards involved. A detailed operational hazard analysis is
       required. Lifting heights shall be kept to the absolute minimum required.


Stacking on a transporter or on the launch pad is always a safer alternative.

       18.4.3.7. If a crane operational fault occurs during a solid rocket motor/segment lifting operation
       that leaves the load suspended, the crane power shall not be recycled to clear the fault until crane
       troubleshooting determines the nature of the fault.

                    HAZARDOUS AND SAFETY CRITICAL PROCEDURES

A2.1. Introduction:
   A2.1.1. Determination of Hazardous and Safety Critical Procedures. The Ground Operations
   Plan (GOP) (Attachment 1 of this volume) is the basic document used to initially determine the clas-
   sification of a procedure. Specifically all procedure description and task summaries along with the
   associated Operating & Support Hazard Analyses (O&SHAs) are reviewed. This review validates the
   Range User’s determination of Hazardous, Non-Hazardous, and Safety Critical procedures. Once the
   classification of Hazardous, Non-Hazardous, and Safety Critical is determined, the procedures are
   submitted for review and approval as described in the documentation part of this volume. During
   review of the initial draft procedures, Range Safety shall determine if Pad Safety notification or atten-
   dance shall be required. The review of the draft procedures allows a second opportunity to ensure the
   classification is appropriate.
   A2.1.2. Purpose. Hazardous and safety critical procedures provide a detailed, step-by-step descrip-
   tion of the manner in which hazardous and safety critical operations will be accomplished. The proce-
   dures are the medium from which approval to start any hazardous or safety critical operation is
   obtained from the ranges.
   A2.1.3. Content. This attachment contains the content preparation instructions for the data generated
   by the requirements delineated in Volume 6 of this document.
   A2.1.4. Applicability. This attachment is applicable to the following:

      ical operations on the ranges.
      A2.1.4.2. Construction and management contracts for hazardous facilities.
   A2.1.5. Submittal Process. The hazardous procedure submittal process is as follows:
      A2.1.5.1. One copy of procedures involving hazardous or safety critical operations shall be sub-
      mitted to Range Safety and one copy to Pad Safety for review and approval. The Range User shall
      review, approve, and sign the final procedures to be submitted to Range Safety for approval.
      A2.1.5.2. For new programs, final Pad Safety and Range Safety comments, reviews, and approv-
      als shall be provided to the Range User 45 calendar days after receipt of the procedure.
      A2.1.5.3. For existing programs, final Pad Safety and Range Safety comments, reviews, and
      approvals shall be provided to the Range User 45 calendar days after receipt of the procedure.
      A2.1.5.4. Final approved, published procedures incorporating Range Safety comments shall be
      submitted to Range Safety at least seven calendar days before the conduct of the operation.
   A2.1.6. Final Approval. Hazardous and safety critical procedures shall be approved before starting
   any hazardous or safety critical operations on the ranges.

 Scope Of Checks/Tests:
 Operational Checks: Operation of all controls, limits and safety circuits, and a running examina-
 tion of ropes.
 NOTE: The frequencies indicated in the “Operational Checks” column are binding on the range
 contractor only when the contractor has sole operating responsibility for the equipment. Under any
 other operating arrangement, the range contractor shall perform these checks only as a prerequisite
 to the checks and at the frequencies specified in the “Struc/Mech/Elect Checks” column.
 Struc/Mech/Elect Checks: Complete examination of structure and supports, gears, wheels, bear-
 ings, and brakes as detailed in the inspection plan and/or procedures.
 Rope/Hook Checks: Complete rope inspection for wear, broken wires, diameter reduction, and
 corrosion. Hook inspection for damage and distortion. On installations with dead-end rope termi-
 nations, closely examine the termination to ensure the rope has not slipped in/through its fitting,
 and that the fitting is not cracked.
 Load Test: Test initially and following major repairs, alterations and modifications to 125 percent
 of rated load, and thereafter to 100 percent per range policy.
 Hook Test: Test by magnetic particle or other suitable crack detecting process.
 This attachment supersedes all previous editions.

                        RANGE SAFETY LAUNCH COMMIT CRITERIA

A7.1. Introduction. Range Safety launch commit criteria (RSLCC) are those criteria associated with
launch day parameters that must be met prior to final SW/SE approval for launch. These criteria ensure
public, launch site, and launch complex safety. They include launch vehicle, range, and environmental
factors.
   A7.1.1. Purpose. This attachment provides Range Users with general, and, where possible, specific
   information regarding RSLCC. Knowledge of this criteria may help Range Users to better understand
   and plan for potential Range Safety holds or scrubs as a result of related violations during the launch
   countdown.
   A7.1.2. Content. Descriptions of each RSLCC are included in this attachment. Where possible, the
   exact criteria used during the countdown are provided. General criteria are provided for cases in
   which the criteria are too complex to address in this publication and/or where the criteria is in a state
   of flux. Range Safety offices of primary responsibility (OPR) and referenced documents are provided
   as sources of additional information.
   A7.1.3. Applicability. All RSLCC are not applicable to all launch vehicles. The applicability of each
   RSLCC is identified in the individual descriptions. Additional specific RSLCC may be provided as
   part of the range safety operational requirements (RSOR) or operations supplement to the RSOR for
   each individual mission.

A7.2. Range Safety Launch Commit Criteria:
   A7.2.1. Flight Safety Systems. Flight safety systems are those ground and airborne systems required
   to monitor, track, aid decision making, and, if necessary, destroy errant launch vehicles in flight.
       A7.2.1.1. Ground Range Safety Systems:
          A7.2.1.1.1. General Description. Ground Range Safety Systems include such systems as the
          command terminate system, range tracking system (RTS), telemetry data transmitting system
          (TDTS), Range Safety display systems (RSD), and all other associated ground-based systems
          necessary to monitor, track, aid decision making, and destroy an errant launch vehicle.
          A7.2.1.1.2. Applicability. All launch vehicle missions using a command flight termination
          system (FTS) require certain ground range safety system assets to be operational prior to
          launch. The launch vehicle configuration, launch azimuth, and other factors drive the selection
          of necessary ground safety system assets.
          A7.2.1.1.3. Ground Range Safety System Launch Commit Criteria:
              A7.2.1.1.3.1. Range tracking systems include radars, optics, and telemetered inertial guid-
              ance downlinks.
                  A7.2.1.1.3.1.1. Two adequate and independent tracking sources shall be available
                  throughout powered flight.
                      A7.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Adequate is defined by error statistics for each source.

                A7.2.1.1.3.1.1.2. Independent is defined as having no common components or
                systems between the vehicle and the front-end computers in the Range Operations
                Control Center (ROCC) such as to create a common failure mode.
            A7.2.1.1.3.1.2. Tracking sources shall be tested prior to launch to ensure requirements
            for accuracy and data integrity such as good communication with the ROCC.
         A7.2.1.1.3.2. The CDS has dual transmitter sites connected to central command in the
         ROCC. The system is capable of operation in both secure and non-secure modes.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.1. A dual command site (two transmitters connected by an automatic
            failover control system) and two command data links shall be available throughout
            powered flight.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.2. Using test codes, closed loop testing shall be performed between com-
            mand central and each site prior to launch to ensure proper performance of the system.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.3. Using flight codes, closed loop testing shall be performed between
            command central and the Launch Area command site prior to launch to ensure code
            integrity.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.4. Using test codes, open loop testing shall be performed between com-
            mand central, via the Launch Area command site, to the launch vehicle before launch
            to ensure total system integrity.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.5. System testing shall include the use of both the Flight Termination
            Unit (FTU) and the Range Safety control and display (RASCAD) console.
            A7.2.1.1.3.2.6. Using test codes, open loop testing shall be performed between com-
            mand central, via each command site, to the command destruct independent test sets
            (CDITS) prior to launch to quantitatively verify proper message, code, and radio fre-
            quency parameters.
         A7.2.1.1.3.3. Computer and data communications systems, including RSD systems, col-
         lect and process data from the tracking sources. They calculate vehicle state vector infor-
         mation and predict the vacuum impact point of a vehicle in real time. In addition, the
         vehicle positional information generated in the RSD system is used to point command ter-
         minate antennas at the vehicle and provide the MFCO with graphic displays of vehicle
         position, velocity, and impact point overlaid on a geographic representation of the flight.
            A7.2.1.1.3.3.1. Using end-to-end playback of theoretical data, the proper function of
            all computer and data communication systems shall be verified prior to launch.
            A7.2.1.1.3.3.2. The data processing and display (RTP/RSD) systems and their associ-
            ated peripheral support equipment are configured in two independent strings connected
            with an automatic failover system. A minimum of two strings shall function correctly
            before allowing a vehicle to launch.
      A7.2.1.1.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 30 SW/SEO and 45 SW/SEO are the OPRs
      and 1 ROPS and 2 ROPS the Office of Corollary Responsibility (OCR) for determining
      ground safety systems launch commit criteria. 30 SW/SEO and 45 SW/SEO are the OPRs and
      the Chief of Wing Safety approves the RSOR. 30 SW/SEO and 45 SW/SEO are the OPRs and

        is approved by the Chief of Wing Safety.
        A7.2.1.1.5. Reference Documents. Vehicle-specific ground safety systems launch commit
        criteria shall be documented in the RSOR. Mission-specific modifications to the RSOR are
        published for each operation in the operations supplement.
     A7.2.1.2. Airborne Flight Safety Systems:
        A7.2.1.2.1. General Description. Airborne FSSs include the FTS and the airborne RTS.
        A7.2.1.2.2. Airborne FTS. An airborne FTS is required for all powered flight stages of a
        launch vehicle in accordance with Volume 2 of this publication. The need for an airborne FTS
        for all upper stages, payloads, and/or spacecraft capable of powered flight is determined as
        part of the flight plan approval process addressed in Volume 2. An RTS is required for all
        launch vehicles per Volume 2.
        A7.2.1.2.3. Airborne FSS Launch Commit Criteria:
           A7.2.1.2.3.1. The Operations Safety Console (OSC) (ER) and the Flight Safety Project
           Officer Console (FSPOC) (WR) shall be used to monitor the status of the airborne FTS
           prior to launch.
               A7.2.1.2.3.1.1. Final airborne FTS open-loop testing shall be performed while on air-
               borne power just before launch.
               A7.2.1.2.3.1.2. All components of the airborne FTS shall be operating within
               expected limits prior to launch.

                A7.2.1.2.5.2. Vehicle-specific airborne RTS launch commit criteria shall be documented
                in the RSOR. Mission-specific modifications to the RSOR shall be published in the opera-
                tions supplement to the RSOR for each operation.
      A7.2.2. Blast:
         A7.2.2.1. General Description. The BLAST model addresses intermediate hazardous range
         effects of a shock wave from an inadvertent detonation, such as from a launch vehicle malfunc-
         tion, impact, or destruction. Near-in areas of overpressure above one pound per square inch (psi)
         are evacuated of personnel and are not considered in the assessment. At far-out distances, with
         overpressures of less than 0.1 psi, there are relatively small hazards. It is the intermediate distance
         with overpressures of 0.1 to 0.5 psi that are of concern. The area encompassing overpressures in
         this range varies considerably with local meteorological conditions.
         A7.2.2.2. Applicability. This launch commit criteria is generally applicable to large launch vehi-
         cles with large amounts of propellants, solid rocket motor launch vehicles with high energy pro-
         pellants, and launch vehicles using launch complexes near the borders of general population.
         A7.2.2.3. Blast Launch Commit Criteria. If the expected casualties of a potential blast over-
         pressure exceed those limits defined in Volume 1 of this publication, Range Safety recommends
         the range go “red” until another BLAST model run can be made with updated meteorological data.

         addressed in the RSOR.
      A7.2.3. Collision Avoidance:
         A7.2.3.1. General Description. A collision avoidance (COLA) analysis is used in the minus
         count to protect manned/mannable orbiting objects from collision with a launch vehicle or its jet-
         tisoned components.
         A7.2.3.2. Applicability. All launch vehicles with the potential to collide with manned/mannable
         orbiting objects shall meet the following criteria:
         A7.2.3.3. Collision Avoidance Launch Commit Criteria:
             A7.2.3.3.1. The COLA program computes the closest approach between the launch vehicle
             and an orbiting object based on a miss distance screening criteria of 200 kilometers for
             manned/mannable objects.
             A7.2.3.3.2. A COLA (no launch) closure time period is calculated for the defined miss dis-
             tance for any object approaching within distances less than the above criteria.
             A7.2.3.3.3. A COLA closure time period shall result in a launch hold for that time period. A
             launch scrub occurs only if the closure time period conflicts with any remaining T-0 for the
             mission launch window.
         A7.2.3.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 30 SW/SEY and 45 SW/SEO are the OPRs for
         determining COLA launch commit criteria.

     A7.2.3.5. Reference Documents. Mission-specific COLA criteria shall be documented in the
     COLA Requirements letter by 45 SW/SEO and 30 SW/SEY.
  A7.2.4. Launch Winds and Debris Hazard:
     A7.2.4.1. Launch Winds (ER Only). A Range Safety wind check (RSWC) program is used to
     compare forecasted T-0 winds and actual winds with statistical wind data and their effects on
     potential launch vehicle debris impacts.
        A7.2.4.1.1. Applicability. All launch vehicles with potentially hazardous launch vehicle
        debris are subject to this launch commit criteria.
        A7.2.4.1.2. Day of Launch Winds Commit Criteria. If forecasted T-0 winds cause poten-
        tial launch vehicle debris dispersions to exceed acceptable statistical wind dispersion limits, a
        launch hold or launch scrub shall be implemented.
        A7.2.4.1.3. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 45 SW/SEO is OPR for day of launch wind
        commit criteria.

            dance with Volume 2, of this publication.
            A7.2.4.1.4.2. At the WR, weather requirements and associated safety analyses shall be
            listed in the RSOR.
     A7.2.4.2. Debris Hazard (WR Only). At the WR, the Launch Risk Analysis (LARA) program is
     used to compute the estimate of casualty to personnel supporting the operation and to the general
     public due to debris from a vehicle destroyed during flight. The LARA program incorporates the
     latest available atmospheric data as well as vehicle breakup, malfunction turn, trajectory, and fail-
     ure rate data.
        A7.2.4.2.1. Applicability. In general, the launch commit criteria is applicable to all launch
        vehicles using an FTS and/or active guidance systems. Some larger rail-launched or unguided
        vehicles may also be affected.
        A7.2.4.2.2. Debris Hazard Launch Commit Criteria. If the expected casualties exceed
        those limits defined in Volume 1 of this publication, Range Safety recommends the range go
        “red” until another LARA model run can be made with updated wind data.

  A7.2.5. Natural and Triggered Lightning:
     A7.2.5.1. General Description. Both natural and triggered lightning can cause launch vehicle
     malfunction and/or destruction. Triggered lightning is the phenomena associated with launch
     vehicles affecting the atmosphere during flight so that, under certain meteorological conditions,
     lightning is triggered and attracted to the launch vehicle.

      A7.2.5.2. Definitions and Explanations:
         A7.2.5.2.1. anvil -Stratiform or fibrous cloud produced by the upper level outflow or
         blow-off from thunder-storms or convective clouds.
         A7.2.5.2.2. associated - Used to denote that two or more clouds are causally related to the
         same weather disturbance or are physically connected. Associated is not synonymous with
         occurring at the same time. An example of clouds that are not associated is air mass clouds
         formed by surface heating in the absence of organized lifting. Also, a cumulus cloud formed
         locally and a physically separated cirrus layer generated by a distant source are not associated,
         even if they occur over or near the launch site at the same time.
         A7.2.5.2.3. Subsidiary Definition: Weather Disturbance
         A7.2.5.2.4. bright band - An enhancement of radar reflectivity caused by frozen hydromete-
         ors falling through the 0 deg C level and beginning to melt.
         A7.2.5.2.5. cloud base - The visible cloud base is preferred. If this is not possible, then the 0
         (zero) dBZ radar reflectivity cloud base is acceptable.
         A7.2.5.2.6. cloud edge - The visible cloud edge is preferred. If this is not possible, then the 0
         (zero) dBZ radar reflectivity cloud edge is acceptable.
         A7.2.5.2.7. cloud layer - A vertically continuous array of clouds, not necessarily of the same
         type, whose bases are approximately at the same level.
         A7.2.5.2.8. cloud top - The visible cloud top is preferred. If this is not possible, then the 0
         (zero) dBZ radar reflectivity cloud top is acceptable.
         A7.2.5.2.9. cumulonimbus cloud - Any convective cloud with any part above the –20 deg C
         temperature level.
         A7.2.5.2.10. debris cloud - Any cloud, except an anvil cloud, that has become detached from
         a parent cumulonimbus cloud or thunderstorm or that results from the decay of a parent cumu-
         lonimbus cloud or thunderstorm.
         A7.2.5.2.11. Subsidiary Definition: Cumulonimbus Cloud
         A7.2.5.2.12. electric field measurement aloft - the magnitude of the instantaneous, vector,
         electric field (E) at a known position in the atmosphere, such as measured by a suitably instru-
         mented, calibrated, and located airborne-field-mill aircraft
         A7.2.5.2.13. Subsidiary Definition: Field Mill
         A7.2.5.2.14. electric field measurement at the surface - The one-minute arithmetic average
         of the vertical electric field (Ez) at the ground measured by a ground-based field mill. The
         polarity of the electric field is the same as that of the potential gradient; that is, the polarity of
         the field at the ground is the same as the dominant charge overhead. Electric field contours
         shall not be used for the electric field measurement at the surface.
         A7.2.5.2.15. Subsidiary Definition: Field Mill
         A7.2.5.2.16. field mill - A specific class of electric-field sensor that uses a moving, grounded
         conductor to induce a time-varying electric charge on one or more sensing elements in propor-
         tion to the ambient electrostatic field.
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                          135


        A7.2.5.2.17. flight path - the planned flight path including its uncertainties (“error bounds”)
        A7.2.5.2.18. moderate precipitation - a precipitation rate of 0.1inches/hr or a radar reflectiv-
        ity factor of 30 dBZ
        A7.2.5.2.19. nontransparent - Sky cover through which forms are blurred, indistinct, or
        obscured is nontransparent. Sky cover through which forms are seen distinctly only through
        breaks in the cloud cover is considered nontransparent. Clouds with a radar reflectivity of 0
        (zero) dBZ or greater are also considered nontransparent. Nontransparency shall be assessed
        for launch time.
        A7.2.5.2.20. Subsidiary Definition: Transparent
        A7.2.5.2.21. precipitation - detectable rain, snow, sleet, hail, or graupel at the ground, or
        virga, or a radar reflectivity greater than 18 dBZ. Moisture on the windscreen of an airplane
        does not by itself constitute a detection of precipitation.
        A7.2.5.2.22. thunderstorm – Any convective cloud that produces lightning.
        A7.2.5.2.23. transparent – Sky cover is transparent if such items as higher clouds, blue sky,
        and stars, can be distinctly seen from below; or if terrain, buildings, lights on the ground, can
        be distinctly seen from above. Visible transparency is required. Transparency must be assessed
        for launch time. Sky cover through which forms are seen distinctly only through breaks in the
        cloud cover is considered nontransparent.
        A7.2.5.2.24. Subsidiary Definition: Nontransparent
        A7.2.5.2.25. weather disturbance – a weather system where dynamical processes destabi-
        lize the air on a scale larger than the individual clouds or cells. Examples of disturbances are
        fronts, troughs, and squall lines.
        A7.2.5.2.26. within – used as a function word to specify a margin in all directions (horizontal,
        vertical, and slant separation) between the cloud edge, base or top and the flight path. For
        example, “within 10 nautical miles of a thunderstorm cloud” means that there must be a 10
        nautical miles margin between every part of a thunderstorm cloud and the flight path.
        A7.2.5.2.27. Subsidiary Definitions: Cloud Base, Cloud Edge, Cloud Top, Flight Path
     A7.2.5.3. Applicability. The Launch Weather Team (LWT) shall have clear and convincing evi-
     dence that the following hazard avoidance criteria are not violated. Even when these criteria are
     not violated, if any other hazardous condition exists, the LWT will report the threat to the Launch
     Director (LD). The LD may hold at any time based on the instability of the weather. All launch
     vehicles are subject to these launch commit criteria.
     A7.2.5.4. Natural and Triggered Lightning Launch Commit Criteria:
        A7.2.5.4.1. Lightning:
            A7.2.5.4.1.1. Do not launch for 30 minutes after any type of lightning occurs in a thunder-

         A7.2.5.4.6.1. Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle through nontransparent
         parts of a cloud layer that is:
             A7.2.5.4.6.1.1. Greater than 4,500 feet thick and any part of the cloud layer along the
             flight path is located between the 0oC and the –20oC levels
             or
             A7.2.5.4.6.1.2. Connected to a cloud layer that, within 5 nautical miles of the flight
             path, is greater than 4,500 feet thick and has any part located between the 0oC and the
             –20oC levels.
             Exception: The following exception applies to both A7.2.5.4.6.1.1 and A7.2.5.4.61.2
             above:
             The cloud is a cirriform cloud that has never been associated with convective clouds,
             and
             is located entirely at temperatures of –15oC or colder,
             and
             shows no evidence of containing liquid water (for example, aircraft icing).
      A7.2.5.4.7. Smoke Plumes. Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle through any
      cumulus cloud that has developed from a smoke plume while the cloud is attached to the
      smoke plume, or for the first 60 minutes after the cumulus cloud is observed to have detached
      from the smoke plume. Cumulus clouds that have formed above a fire but have been detached
      from the smoke plume for more than 60 minutes are considered cumulus clouds and are cov-
      ered in A7.2.5.4.2.

          A7.2.5.4.8. Surface Electric Fields (ER Only):
              A7.2.5.4.8.1. Do not launch for 15 minutes after the absolute value of any electric field
              measurement at the surface within 5 nautical miles of the flight path has been greater that
              1,500 V/m.
              A7.2.5.4.8.2. Do not launch for 15 minutes after the absolute value of any electric field
              measurement at the surface within 5 nautical miles of the flight path has been greater that
              1,000 V/m. Unless:
                 A7.2.5.4.8.2.1. All clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path are transparent;
                 or
                 A7.2.5.4.8.2.2. All nontransparent clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path
                 have cloud tops below the +5oC level and have not been part of convective clouds with
                 cloud tops above the –10oC level within the last 3 hours.
              A7.2.5.4.8.3. Electric field measurements at the surface are used to increase safety by
              detecting electric fields caused by unforeseen or unrecognized hazards. For confirmed fail-
              ure of one or more field mill sensors, the countdown and launch may continue.
          A7.2.5.4.9. Electric Fields Aloft (ER Only). The criteria cited in A7.2.5.4.3, A7.2.5.4.4,
          A7.2.5.4.5, A7.2.5.4.6, A7.2.5.4.7, and A7.2.5.4.8.2 need not be applied if, during the 15 min-
          utes prior to launch time, the instantaneous electric field aloft throughout the volume of air
          expected to be along the flight path, does not exceed EC where EC is shown as a function of
          altitude in Figure A7.1. The thresholds on electric field measurements at the surface in
          A7.2.5.4.8 and elsewhere in these LCC are lower than 5 kV/m (kilovolts per meter) to allow
          for the effect of the surface screening layer.

            A7.2.5.4.10. Triboelectrification. Do not launch if a vehicle has not been treated for surface
            electrification and the flight path will go through any clouds above the –10oC level up to the
            altitude at which the vehicle’s velocity exceeds 3,000ft/sec. A vehicle is considered “treated”
            for surface electrification if:
                A7.2.5.4.10.1. All surfaces of the vehicle susceptible to precipitation particle impact have
                been treated to assure
                    A7.2.5.4.10.1.1. That the surface resistivity is less than 109 ohms/square;
                    and
                    A7.2.5.4.10.1.2. That all conductors on surface (including dielectric surfaces that
                    have been treated with conductive coatings) are bonded to the vehicle by a resistance
                    that is less than 105 ohms;
                    or
                A7.2.5.4.10.2. It has been shown by test or analysis that electrostatic discharges (ESDs)
                on the surface of the vehicle caused by triboelectrification by ice particle impact will not
                be hazardous to the launch vehicle or the mission. In A7.2.5.4.10.1.1 above, the correct
                unit for surface resistivity is ohms/square. This means that any square area of any size
                measured in any units has the same resistance in ohms when the measurement is made
                from an electrode extending the length of one side of the square to an electrode extending
                the length of the opposite side of the square. The area-independence is literally valid only
                for squares; it is not true for other shapes such as rectangles and circles.
         A7.2.5.5. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 30 SW/SEY and 45 SW/SESE along with 30 WS
         and 45 WS are the OPRs for natural and triggered lightning launch commit criteria. 30 SW/SE and
         45 SW/SE are the OCRs.
         A7.2.5.6. Reference Documents. Additional or different mission specific natural and triggered
         lightning launch commit criteria shall be documented in the RSOR.
      A7.2.6. Toxics:
         A7.2.6.1. General Description. A variety of predictive models and analytical techniques are
         used to ensure that the public and launch area personnel are not exposed to toxic chemicals in con-
         centrations that exceed applicable threshold limits. Key considerations include, but are not limited
         to, the specific commodities loaded and their quantity; potential agents resulting from mixing and/
         or reactions; nature or mechanism of release; and weather parameters such as wind speed, wind
         direction, temperature, temperature gradient, inversion layer, surface reflection coefficient, expo-
         sure response functions, and cloud cover as well as the uncertainty of these parameters.
         A7.2.6.2. Applicability. All launch vehicles, including payloads, with potentially hazardous
         chemicals are subject to this toxic launch commit criteria. Range Users shall identify the specific
         toxic/hazardous commodities and the quantity that will be contained on each launch vehicle/pay-
         load mission, and shall provide data in compliance with Volume 2 of this publication.
         A7.2.6.3. Toxic Launch Commit Criteria. Acceptable exposure limits for various commodities
         are governed by a number of standards, statutes, and specifications. These standards, statutes, and
         specifications are subject to frequent revision based on controlled studies, real-world events, and
AFSPCMAN91-710V6 1 JULY 2004                                                                         141


     other discoveries. Additionally, commodity loads also vary among launch vehicle classes and
     there are differences between variants within the same class. If the expected casualties of an expo-
     sure to a toxic commodity exceed those limits defined in Volume 1 of this publication, Range
     Safety recommends that the range go “red” until another run can be made with updated meteoro-
     logical data. For ER toxic launch commit criteria see RSOR 19, and for guidance regarding a spe-
     cific commodity or set of commodities in the case of a particular launch vehicle, contact the 45
     SW Office of Safety, Missile Systems Division, Engineering Support Section (45 SW/SESE). At
     the WR, the 30 SWI 91-106 defines the exposure criteria, unit support requirements, actions
     required for hot and cold spill potential Hazard Zones as well as other requirements.
     A7.2.6.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 30 SW/SEY and 45 SW/SESE are the OPRs for
     toxic launch commit criteria.
     A7.2.6.5. Reference Documents. Mission-specific toxic launch commit criteria shall be
     addressed in the RSOR.
  A7.2.7. Safety Clearance Zones. Safety Clearance Zones are restricted areas designated for
  day-to-day prelaunch processing and launch operations to protect the public, launch area, and launch
  complex personnel. These zones are established for each launch vehicle and/or payload at specific
  processing facilities to include launch complexes. Safety Clearance Zones include Hazardous Clear
  Areas and Hazardous Launch Areas.
     A7.2.7.1. Hazardous Clear Areas:
         A7.2.7.1.1. General Description. Hazardous Clear Areas are Safety Clearance Zones for
         ground processing that are defined in the Operations Safety Plan for each operating facility.
         Hazardous Clear Areas include Blast Danger Areas (BDA), Control Area Clears, and Toxic
         Hazard Corridor (THC) (ER) and Toxic Hazard Zone (WR).
         A7.2.7.1.2. Applicability. All launch vehicles and, if necessary, associated payloads shall be
         evaluated and hazardous clear areas determined.
         A7.2.7.1.3. Hazardous Clear Areas Launch Commit Criteria:
             A7.2.7.1.3.1. Blast Danger Area. Clearance prior to establishment of a major explosive
             hazard such as vehicle fuel/oxidizer load and pressurization. This is the area subject to
             fragment and direct overpressure resulting form the explosion of the booster/payload.
             A7.2.7.1.3.2. Control Area Clear. Clearance of defined areas to protect personnel from
             hazardous operations
             A7.2.7.1.3.3. Toxic Hazard Corridor/Zone. Clearance area of a sector in which toxic
             material may exceed predetermined concentration levels

         during launch operations and include the flight caution area (FCA), flight hazard area (FHA),
         the vessel exclusion area (VEA)(ER) /boat exclusion area (BEA)(WR) and the Impact Limit
         Lines (ILLs).
         A7.2.7.2.2. Applicability. All launch vehicles and, if necessary, associated payloads, shall be
         evaluated and hazardous launch areas determined.

            A7.2.7.2.3. Hazardous Launch Area Launch Commit Criteria:
                A7.2.7.2.3.1. FHA. Only Range Safety approved launch-essential personnel in approved
                blast-hardened structures with adequate breathing protection are permitted in this area dur-
                ing a launch. (See Volume 7 for the definition of flight hazard area.)
                A7.2.7.2.3.2. FCA. Only Range Safety approved launch-essential personnel with ade-
                quate breathing protection are permitted in this area during launch. (See Volume 7 for a
                definition of flight caution area.)
                A7.2.7.2.3.3. VEA/BEA. Ships and aircraft shall remain outside this area during launch.
                Ships/boats are protected to a Pi level of 1 x 10-5. Aircraft are protected to a Pi level of 1 x
                10-8. (See Volume 7 for definitions of vessel exclusion area and boat exclusion area.)
                A7.2.7.2.3.4. ILL. Range Safety approved launch-essential and neighboring operations
                personnel are permitted within ILLs during a launch. Non-essential personnel, with SW
                Commander approval, may be permitted in this area during a launch; however, the collec-
                tive risk shall not exceed acceptable standards for the general public. (See Volume 7 for
                definitions of impact limit line, launch-essential personnel, and neighboring operations
                personnel.)
      A7.2.8. Launch Area Air And Sea Surveillance:
         A7.2.8.1. General Description. Areas to be cleared of boats and ships are defined by Flight
         Analysis and based on probability contours and/or Toxic Hazard Zones, including known impact
         areas of jettisoned stages/bodies and destruct debris resulting from malfunction scenarios plus the
         areas and altitudes in which Toxic Hazards will exist. Areas defined by Notice to Airmen
         (NOTAM) and Notice to Mariners (NTM) are surveyed on launch day for intruder aircraft and are
         analyzed as a potential for risk to the launch vehicle or the aircraft.
         A7.2.8.2. Applicability. These criteria are applicable to all CCAFS/KSC pad launches and select
         offshore Navy launches and all 30 SW launch operations.
         A7.2.8.3. Launch Area Air and Sea Surveillance Launch Commit Criteria:
            A7.2.8.3.1. Boat and Ship Traffic:
                A7.2.8.3.1.1. At the ER, if the sum total of the individual hit probabilities of all targets
                plotted within, or predicted to be within, the established probability contours exceed 10-5,
                a launch hold or scrub may be initiated.
                A7.2.8.3.1.2. At the WR, if an individual vessel is exposed to a probability of impact
                greater than 10-5, the vessel shall be moved or a launch hold or scrub may be initiated.
            A7.2.8.3.2. Aircraft. For an aircraft posing a threat to itself or the launch vehicle by its
            expected position being within predetermined hazard corridors, launch hold or scrub may
            result until the aircraft clears the hazard corridor.
         A7.2.8.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility. At the ER, 45 SW/SEO is the OPR for launch area
         air and sea surveillance. At the WR, the ACO is the OPR for launch area air and sea surveillance;
         however, 30 SW/SEY performs the analysis for the hazard areas and the boat exclusion area
         (BEA).

  A7.2.9. Jettisoned Bodies Impacting Land in Launch Area:
     A7.2.9.1. General Description. Jettisoned components shall be prohibited from impacting on a
     landmass. For certain launch vehicles, the possibility exists for jettisoned bodies such as nozzle
     closures to impact in the launch area near occupied facilities or resources requiring protection.
     This is allowed in these cases when the risks associated are mitigated or minimized. Hit probabil-
     ity contours are created and used in conjunction with launch day impact prediction runs to deter-
     mine possible threat near the predicted impact location.
     A7.2.9.2. Applicability. All vehicles jettisoning components in the launch area with the potential
     to impact land.
     A7.2.9.3. Jettisoned Bodies Launch Commit Criteria. Launch day impact prediction runs are
     made and the associated probability contours or impact dispersions are overlaid with the launch
     areas. A launch hazard may result in a launch hold or scrub condition.
     A7.2.9.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility. 30 SW/SEY and 45 SW/SEO are the OPRs for jet-
     tisoned bodies impacting land.
