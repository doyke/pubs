It introduces the electronic periodic history format and provides a 3-year period for implementation. Dur-
ing this interim period, historians may continue to produce paper periodic histories, but are highly encour-
aged to begin publishing them in the electronic format. It reorganizes the Semiannual Historical Activity
Report. It also changes and refines the process and criteria used in assessing periodic histories.

1.3. Commanders.
    1.3.1. History is a function of command. Accordingly, commanders are an essential part of building a
    successful history program. To accomplish these responsibilities, commanders:
       1.3.1.1. Give historians access commensurate with their security clearance to all information they
       need to prepare accurate, objective, and comprehensive historical publications and records.
       1.3.1.2. Ensure their historians have adequate office space and resources necessary to maintain
       and protect historical documents, to research paper and electronic files (software and hardware),
       to provide research assistance to the staff, and to attend Air Force history conferences and sympo-
       siums.
       1.3.1.3. Review and sign their unit’s histories in a timely manner.

1.4. Field Organizations. As discussed in the following subsections, establishments and units through-
out the Air Force perform history functions consistent with AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. They
also document their significant activities in periodic histories.
    1.4.1. Major Commands (MAJCOM) and Subordinate Units. One function of Air Force command is
    to document an organization’s significant activities. Each MAJCOM headquarters, wing, center, lab-
    oratory, and comparable organization establishes and maintains a history office (HO) as a separate
    staff agency consistent with the standards established by AFI 38-101. These agencies will be staffed
    by qualified personnel who report directly to the command section (commander, vice commander, or
    director of staff). For the purpose of this instruction, the Air National Guard (ANG) headquarters’ his-
    tory office performs as a MAJCOM history office in managing its programs.
    1.4.1. (302AW) The Wing Executive Officer is the liaison between the full-time cadre of the Wing
    and the Wing Historian. Both operational and administrative support is required. As a first priority,
    the executive officer must ensure that a historical record of all Wing operations is maintained. This
    may include detailing the Wing Historian to deploy with an operation, assigning a historical represen-
    tative from a unit involved in the mission, or other means sufficient to record historical source data.
    Day-to-day documentation is also important. The executive officer should provide historical leads and

                          HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES

Section 2A—Periodic Histories

2.1. Definition of Purpose of Air Force History. History is an objective, accurate, descriptive, and
interpretive record of all activities of the Air Force in peace and war. By recounting lessons learned, Air
Force history enables our nations’ military and civilian leaders to approach current problems and concerns
more intelligently and professionally. Evaluation of past experience is of great value to planners and deci-
sion-makers in determining current policies and preparing for current and future contingencies. Knowl-
edge of history is a significant factor in determining the success or failure of a particular policy, plan, or
operation.
     2.1.1. Products. Historians prepare various types of publications, papers, and other products. They
     also serve as advisors for other projects like historical exhibits and displays. These products:
        2.1.1.1. Preserve an official record of Air Force mission accomplishment.
        2.1.1.2. Make valuable information available to decision-makers and action officers.
        2.1.1.3. Support professional military education.
        2.1.1.4. Promote awareness of Air Force heritage.
        2.1.1.5. Provide reference material for researchers.
     2.1.2. Periodic histories and other historical products may be distributed electronically or in paper
     format as appropriate. Only standard Air Force licensed software will be used to produce these prod-
     ucts.
NOTE: All histories will be produced, preserved, and distributed electronically within three years from
the date of this publication.

2.2. Periodic Histories (RCS: HAF-HO(A or SA)7101). Consist of narrative accounts of significant
events supported by collections of original source documents. Periodic histories are essential to the insti-
tutional memory of Air Force organizations and their activities. These documents serve as the only offi-
cial Air Force effort to systematically preserve information for research and reference.
     2.2.1. Each organization with a full-time historian prepares a periodic history according to instruc-
     tions in Chapter 3.
     2.2.2. The standard coverage period for periodic histories is 12 months (RCS: HAF-HO (A) 7101)for
     all organizations. Complete them by the last day of the 7th month following the end of the coverage
     period. MAJCOM/HOs may specify more frequent reporting periods as needed (RCS: HAF-HO (SA)
     7101 for semi-annual histories).
NOTE: History is current once it reaches the organization's command section ready for the commander's
signature. The historian must notify (by e-mail) the MAJCOM/HO and the commander's executive officer
of the date when the history is taken to the command section. The history becomes an official record upon
signature of the commander.
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                        11


   2.2.3. For non-current programs, HQ USAF/HO may adjust the coverage period and due date of peri-
   odic histories for MAJCOMs, HQ USAF DRUs, and FOAs. Requests for adjustments must be signed
   by the organization commander, vice commander, or director of staff and dated no later than 30 days
   prior to original due date.
   2.2.4. For non-current programs, MAJCOM/HOs may adjust the coverage period and due date based
   on command or individual needs. Requests for adjustments must be signed by the unit commander,
   vice commander, or director of staff and dated no later than 30 days prior to original due date. Auto-
   matic extensions will be granted for contingency-related and formal training TDYs. Inform HQ
   USAF/HO of such changes.
   2.2.5. Distribute periodic histories within 30 calendar days of the date signed.

Section 2B—Heritage Pamphlets

2.3. Heritage Pamphlets. Assigned personnel are the primary audience for these brief, unclassified his-
torical accounts of an organization and any predecessor or related organizations. Clear the pamphlet
through Public Affairs for distribution outside the organization.
   2.3.1. Organizations with full-time historians prepare these pamphlets and post them on the unit’s
   website for widespread access.
   2.3.2. The Heritage Pamphlet normally consists of a narrative plus tables with key lineage, honors,
   and mission data. It should also include historically significant images highlighting mission accom-
   plishment. Include a short history of the installation in the pamphlet of a base host unit.
   2.3.3. The pamphlet is a living document and will be updated electronically either annually or after
   major changes in mission, organization, leadership, or accomplishments. Ensure the pamphlet
   includes a “current as of ” date. Print as needed.

Section 2C—Historical Publications

2.4. Studies. Air Force historians at all levels research and write a variety of historical products -both
classified and unclassified- studying significant issues, policies, operations, programs, developments,
doctrine, procedures, or comparable topics.
   2.4.1. These products can vary widely in length and format depending on the topic covered and
   intended audience. In-depth narrative studies of significant topics should provide thorough source
   citations for the information presented and include many of the same features and components used in
   the preparation of periodic histories (see Chapter 3). In some cases, extensive studies on topics of
   general interest may, if unclassified and cleared for public release, be published as books. In addition
   to lengthy and fully documented narrative examinations of a topic (sometimes referred to as “mono-
   graphs”), historical studies can also take the form of chronologies, study reports, technical reports,
   statistical analyses, bibliographical essays, and annotated document collections.
   2.4.2. Historians at wings, centers, and other subordinate organizations are encouraged to produce
   studies on topics within their units having potential long-range historical significance. Subordinate
   historians must coordinate proposed studies and final drafts with their respective MAJCOM/HO. His-
   torians at MAJCOM headquarters, FOAs, and DRUs will inform HQ USAF/HO of proposed topics of
   potential Air Force-wide interest.

     2.4.3. Distribute final products as widely as possible contingent on the subject and classification.
     MAJCOM/HOs must approve distribution outside of originating wings and centers. Send one digital
     copy, complete with digital supporting documents, to AFHRA/ISA. If a complete digital copy is not
     produced, send one paper copy complete with paper supporting documents. Do not mix digital and
     paper formats. The AFHRA will send studies and reports to the Air University Library as required by
     AFI 36-2303, Documents and Publications for AU Library, and other reference libraries and docu-
     ment repositories as appropriate. Submit studies on technical subjects to the Defense Technical Infor-
     mation Center (DTIC) in accordance with AFI 61-202, USAF Technical Publications Program.
     Before distribution or release to members of the public, submit final manuscripts to Public Affairs
     offices in accordance with AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures.

2.5. Interviews. Within the Air Force History and Museums Program, there are three types of interviews.
     2.5.1. Air Force Oral History Program Interviews. This program captures the insights and perspec-
     tives of significant Air Force personnel. Ordinarily, AFHRA personnel conduct these interviews;
     however, other Air Force historians may also do so with approval.
        2.5.1.1. Subordinate historians must coordinate proposed interviews with their respective MAJ-
        COM/HO, who then forwards the proposal to AFHRA/RS, which in turn, requests approval from
        HQ USAF/HO. HQ USAF/HO is the final authority.
        2.5.1.2. Send transcripts and the audio, video, or digital recordings with bookmarks to AFHRA/
        RS for the Air Force Oral History collection.
     2.5.2. Historical Research Interviews. These interviews are in support of periodic history research.
     See paragraph 3.3.3.8.
     2.5.3. All Other Interviews. This category includes all other interviews used to preserve Air Force
     heritage. Send transcripts and the audio, video, or digital recording to AFHRA/RS.

2.6. Books. Historians usually publish these major projects through the Government Printing Office after
a thorough review process and professional editing. In some cases, field historians may publish books
locally, usually in cooperation with nonprofit organizations. Coordinate proposals for all such projects
with HQ USAF/HO.

2.7. Articles and Essays. Historians are encouraged to write articles and essays (including book
reviews) for publication. Submit material for security and policy review prior to publication. Follow the
instructions in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures.

2.8. Staff Papers. Use every opportunity to prepare background papers, point papers, talking papers, and
similar products on the historical aspects of interest to commanders and directors. For formats, see AF
Handbook (AFH) 33-337, The Tongue and Quill.

Section 2D—Other Historical Projects

2.9. Oral Presentations and Visual Information. Historians make presentations to audiences inter-
ested in Air Force history and heritage. Examples of these projects may include briefings, tours, staff
rides, videos, and PME presentations.
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                           13


2.10. Exhibits. These projects foster an appreciation of the Air Force’s heritage and the organization’s
history. Historians assist project officers in the production and display of historical or organizational her-
itage exhibits by researching and writing historical commentary, as well as gathering photographs and
other materials.

        WRITING PERIODIC HISTORIES AND OTHER HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS

Section 3A—Preparing Periodic Histories

3.1. Using the Historical Method. The principles and procedures in this section apply primarily to the
preparation of periodic histories. Adapt and use them when preparing other types of publications.
     3.1.1. Historical Perspective. Use historical perspective to determine what information is worthy of
     preservation based on the organization’s mission, the historian’s professional judgment, and sugges-
     tions by the commander and staff.
     3.1.2. Impartiality. Historians are impartial observers and must strive for constant objectivity, critical
     evaluation, and full appreciation of the importance of factual data, as opposed to hearsay, prejudice,
     and propaganda.
     3.1.3. Facts. Each fact or event in a history has a certain relative importance to all other facts and
     events. Similarly, each activity in the unit has relative importance to all other activities. The history
     must emphasize those facts judged to be important on the basis of the unit’s mission; for example, an
     operational unit’s flying activities are more important than its services activities.
        3.1.3.1. Carefully and methodically collect, assemble, verify, and present factual data as the basis
        for conclusions and interpretations.
        3.1.3.2. Evaluate data to determine relative importance.
        3.1.3.3. Be specific in presenting the facts.
        3.1.3.4. Remain alert to gaps and inaccuracies in official documents and reports.
     3.1.4. Emphasis. People make history. History reflects the activities of people working individually
     and collectively to accomplish the organization’s mission. In the narrative and supporting documents,
     emphasize events affecting:
        3.1.4.1. The organization's mission performance.
        3.1.4.2. Leaders' decision-making. Remember, decision makers not only include officers, but also
        enlisted members, civilians, and contract personnel.
        3.1.4.3. Outside agencies' actions and events that influenced the organization’s activities.
        3.1.4.4. The organization's execution of higher headquarters policies and directives.
     3.1.5. Focus. Preparing periodic histories of an Air Force organization requires application of histor-
     ical methodology and discipline to systematically preserve significant information for the future.
     3.1.6. Topics. All manner of topics and events come under the purview of historians. Emphasize sig-
     nificant activities affecting mission accomplishment. Especially consider information that will be use-
     ful to future planners. The list below, while neither inclusive nor exclusive, indicates topics generally
     worthy of consideration for historical coverage.
        3.1.6.1. Mission.
        3.1.6.2. Organization.
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                          15


       3.1.6.3. Leadership.
       3.1.6.4. Relationships with other organizations.
       3.1.6.5. Operations.
       3.1.6.6. Planning.
       3.1.6.7. Training.
       3.1.6.8. Logistics.
       3.1.6.9. Maintenance.
       3.1.6.10. Communications and electronics.
       3.1.6.11. Environment.
       3.1.6.12. Facilities.
       3.1.6.13. Community and host nation relations.
       3.1.6.14. Budget.
       3.1.6.15. Personnel.
       3.1.6.16. Mission Support (include medical issues affecting the organization).

3.2. Research Methodology. Conducting timely, continuing, systematic, and thorough research is a
never-ending process and essential to preparing useful periodic histories. Research must include direct
contact with people performing the mission. This will validate and amplify existing documentation. Visi-
bility and interaction within the unit is critical to the historian’s mission accomplishment and credibility.
   3.2.1. Begin with an outline.
       3.2.1.1. Use the table of contents of the previous history and the research file plan to develop a
       preliminary outline of potential subjects. Revise the outline as new topics become evident and dis-
       card old ones.
       3.2.1.2. Review the narrative of the previous history to help determine topics for research. Vari-
       ous activities may overlap reporting periods. Also review MAJCOM/HO feedback on prior histo-
       ries.
       3.2.1.3. Consider recommendations from the commander, staff, and unit members.
       3.2.1.4. Conduct systematic research in files of key offices in the organization. In today’s Air
       Force, data is shared through the use of organizational shared drives. As a result, historians require
       read-only access with ability to download files from key organizational shared drives on both
       Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network so
       they can conduct thorough research in key mission areas.
       3.2.1.5. Continually monitor key websites, public electronic mail (e-mail) folders, and shared
       drives that destroy or update their records on a short cycle. Research the e-mail accounts and com-
       puterized databases of key offices.
       3.2.1.6. Watch for key words in both folder and document file names when researching organiza-
       tional shared drives to detect clues about the information contained within.
16                                                             AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007


        3.2.1.7. Download complete documents for reference or use as supporting documents.
        3.2.1.8. Review material obtained through automatic distribution, the recurring reports index and
        directives pertaining to the unit's mission and weapons systems.
        3.2.1.9. Subscribe to those Report Control Symbol (RCS) products used repeatedly as well as pol-
        icy letters, bulletins, and other potential sources of useful information.
        3.2.1.10. Establish a systematic method of filing and referencing both electronic and paper
        research material. Historians commonly use a topical filing system. Add or delete topics as
        research and writing progress. Besides using files as the basis for historical reporting, use them as
        reference tools for answering inquiries about recent events.

3.3. Historical Sources. Documents are categorized either as primary or secondary. Primary sources are
original documents or first records of facts or events, for example, after-action reports and trip reports.
Secondary sources are other writers' discussions, interpretations, or analyses of primary material, such as
newspaper articles. Historians use primary sources to establish historical facts and secondary sources for
background information.
     3.3.1. Assure the authenticity of all primary sources against the following criteria: a signed, dated
     copy of a memo or letter on letterhead stationery; a document certified by the office of origin; orders
     and other directives; and e-mail sent or received from people directly involved.
     3.3.2. Critically examine information and opinions contained in one primary source by comparing it
     with other sources. Information collated from a number of sources usually presents a more accurate
     version of an event than data obtained from a single source.
     3.3.3. Documentary Sources.
        3.3.3.1. Publications. Policy and mission directives (AFPD and AFMD), instructions (AFI), doc-
        trine documents (AFDD), and in particular, organizational supplements affecting the structure and
        mission of an organization. Review them frequently for changes.
        3.3.3.2. Orders. Military headquarters direct and authenticate changes, actions, or procedures
        through various types of orders. Review all orders for possible use. These include movement,
        alert, warning, deployment, execution, tasking, operations, technical, and special orders.
        3.3.3.3. Correspondence. Obtain letters, memoranda, messages, e-mail, and comparable commu-
        nications within and between organizations and key personnel that are important to documenting
        developments of historical significance.
        3.3.3.4. Reports and Studies. A staff study analyzes an issue and establishes the central concern
        and all related facts. It considers various options and offers recommendations. Staff studies are of
        special interest to historians because they often precede and form the basis for significant deci-
        sions. Preserve these documents prepared by or about an organization in the periodic history.
        Include unit assessments and reports of inspections, tests, audits, major exercises, operations, and
        trip reports. Include as a supporting document in the periodic history an end-of-tour report pre-
        pared by a departing commander, if available. It relates a unique perspective on the commander's
        major challenges, issues, accomplishments, problems, and lessons learned. Preserve studies and
        reports that are presented as briefings, position papers and talking papers.

       3.3.3.5. Statistical and Graphic Matter. Include organizational charts, station lists, order-of-battle
       information, maps, manning documents, sortie data, etc. They are indispensable components of
       periodic histories. Put them within the narrative or in an appendix. Fully identify the source of the
       item by including a full citation.
       3.3.3.6. Contingency and Wartime Data. Collect and record detailed data and comprehensive
       documentation during wartime and contingency operations. Such research is the highest priority
       for historians in operational units and headquarters. This effort is critical to later historical analy-
       sis, research, and writing. See AFI 84-102, Attachment 3, Historical Operations in Contingency
       and War, for guidance on wartime and contingency historical requirements.
       3.3.3.7. Meetings. Historians attend staff meetings, briefings, planning sessions and policy-mak-
       ing gatherings that are important to writing the periodic history.
       3.3.3.8. Research Interviews. People who have personal knowledge of one or more phases of
       organizational activities are a principal source of historical data. Data obtained from a person sup-
       plement the documentary record, fill in those “gaps” that commonly appear in the written record,
       offer reasons for and explanations of the factual material found in documents, give insight into the
       problems and aims of commanders, and provide the historian with firsthand accounts and experi-
       ence not found in formal records.
          3.3.3.8.1. Conduct interviews with the commander and/or senior staff members at least once
          during each reporting period.
          3.3.3.8.2. Conduct interviews as soon as possible after key events take place while the facts
          are still clear in the interviewee's mind.
          3.3.3.8.3. Before the interview, prepare a list of questions based on thorough research of
          important issues confronting the unit. Phrase your questions to encourage elaboration (not
          merely "Yes" or "No" answers). Focus questions on information unavailable from other
          sources and on confirming questionable information collected from other sources.
          3.3.3.8.4. Use an audio recorder or take thorough notes during interviews to ensure accurate
          information. Ask the interviewee for permission to use a recorder.
          3.3.3.8.5. Use transcripts or summaries of significant interviews as supporting documents in
          periodic histories. Authenticated interviews are official documents and thus primary sources.
          Give the interviewee a transcript or summarized version of the interview for review, correc-
          tion, and authentication.
       3.3.3.9. Accident Information. When covering accidents, do not cite mishap messages or safety
       investigation board reports as sources or use as supporting documents. See AFI 91-204, Safety
       Investigations and Reports for restrictions on privileged safety information. Never mention any
       formal findings, conclusions, causes, or recommendations. Cover the basic facts about an accident
       (presented in Part I of an investigation board’s report) in accordance with AFI 51-503, Aerospace
       Accident Investigations.

3.4. Security and Administrative Markings. Mark and handle historical publications according to the
references listed below. Achieve a working familiarity with these directives.
   3.4.1. DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, and AFI 31-401, Information Secu-
   rity Program Management, and other pertinent directives covering classified information.

     3.4.2. AF SUP 1 to DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, For Official Use
     Only (FOUO) material.
     3.4.3. AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, for inspection-related privileged information (PV)
     material.
     3.4.4. AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, for information with a distri-
     bution limitation (DL).
     3.4.5. Other directives as required.

3.5. Components of Periodic Histories. Unless a part is identified here as optional, use all of these com-
ponents, in this order, in a periodic history. Add other components that enhance the usefulness of the
product.
NOTE: Requirements concerning the components of periodic histories will change as the program tran-
sitions to an all-electronic format.
     3.5.1. Covers. Use preprinted blue covers until stocks are exhausted. Then use standard red-brown
     pressboard covers.
        3.5.1.1. Procure red-brown covers:
            3.5.1.1.1. NSN 7510-00-286-7794 for left-bind covers without ACCO fasteners.
            3.5.1.1.2. NSN 7510-00-281-4309 for top-bind covers.
        3.5.1.2. Follow Attachment 2 for Front-cover, use an appropriately sized adhesive label.
        3.5.1.3. Be sure information from the title page appears on the front of the history. For a blue
        cover, be sure the information shows through a die-cut window. For a pressboard cover, use an
        appropriately sized adhesive label.
        3.5.1.4. The full name of the unit.
        3.5.1.5. Inclusive dates of the period covered.
        3.5.1.6. (U) if the volume is classified
        3.5.1.7. The volume number.
     3.5.2. Title Page. Follow Attachment 2 for title page information and layout requirements.
     3.5.3. Security Notice and Administrative Controls Page. This page summarizes information about
     the sources used to prepare the history. This page is required in every CD/DVD or volume of a peri-
     odic history (see Attachment 3 for further guidelines) unless it contains no classified or controlled
     information.
     3.5.4. Frontispiece (Optional). Use a relevant illustration that will reproduce clearly.
     3.5.5. Foreword (Optional). A statement written by someone other than the author.
     3.5.6. Preface. An explanatory statement by the author or chief historian.
     3.5.7. Table of Contents. This is an information-finding aid. Keep the reader in mind by making it
     specific and accurate. In electronic histories, hyperlink all chapters, sections, subsections and appen-
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                          19


  dices. List all supporting document volumes and indicate the document numbers in each printed vol-
  ume. Use short, descriptive headings for sections and subsections. Use the format in Attachment 4.
  3.5.8. List of Illustrations. In electronic histories, hyperlink all tables, charts, photographs, and maps;
  otherwise, use the format in Attachment 5.
  3.5.9. Chronology. List events in chronological order.
     3.5.9.1. Determine what to include primarily by gauging the significance of the information to the
     unit.
     3.5.9.2. Cross-reference each entry to the related narrative discussion if it exists. When an entry
     does not relate to the narrative, prepare a footnote (or hyperlink if electronic) identifying the
     entry's sources. Identify appropriate sources as supporting documents according to instructions in
     3.5.15. and Attachment 12.
     3.5.9.3. If classified, prepare an unclassified edition of the chronology as a separate document for
     distribution throughout the unit's staff.
     3.5.9.4. Use format in Attachment 6.
  3.5.10. Executive Summary (Optional). A brief overview of the major events and topics covered in
  the periodic history, their significance, and the author's perspectives or conclusions. If done, consider
  publishing the summary separately for wide distribution in the organization.
  3.5.11. Narrative. As the major component of a periodic history, the narrative relates important
  events in an organized, interesting, and concise manner. Use the typing and layout instructions in 3.6.
  See the sample in Attachment 7.
     3.5.11.1. A high quality or useful periodic history does not require a long narrative. Do not fill the
     product with excessive background information from previous editions or discussions not directly
     relevant to the organization's mission.
     3.5.11.2. Select topics of potential long-term interest. Treat each topic in the narrative according
     to its importance, especially its effect on the unit's ability to accomplish its mission. Detailed data
     on many topics--especially dealing with resources and support--could be needed for future refer-
     ence and research, even though these topics may not warrant discussion in the narrative. Informa-
     tion requests received by the historian may also be used as a guide to topics of long-term interest.
     Preserve sufficient information about such topics in the appendices and supporting documents.
     3.5.11.3. The narrative must not be copied from source documents. A narrative history is not just
     a summary of dates, places, personnel and statistics, nor is it mere statements of fact in outline
     form. Cover significant topics, provide facts, reasons, background, discussion, interpretation and
     analysis relevant to the current reporting period.
     3.5.11.4. Write in simple, direct and grammatically correct language. Use past tense and active
     voice. Avoid military jargon, clichés and words not commonly known. Define or explain scientific
     and technical terms. Limit the use of abbreviations, acronyms and abbreviated unit designations in
     the narrative, explaining them when first used in the text of each chapter and listing them in the
     glossary. Do not use office symbols in the narrative because they tend to change over time.
     3.5.11.5. Provide complete dates in the narrative, that is, day, month, and year. Example: 30 April
     2003.
20                                                             AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007


        3.5.11.6. Spell out the full given name (first name, middle initial, and surname) when first men-
        tioning a person in the narrative of each chapter and in the roster of key personnel. Abbreviate mil-
        itary titles only when followed by initials or given names. Example: Brig Gen Sidney R. Smith. In
        later references, omit the qualifying part of the military title, spell out the rank, and use only the
        last name. Example: General Smith. Use the full title of civilian office holders without abbrevia-
        tion in the text. Example: Secretary of Defense Jerry B. Lathrop. You may abbreviate titles in the
        notes for conciseness. Don’t substitute pay grades (civilian or military) for position titles.
        3.5.11.7. Give precise geographical locations rather than post office numbers, grids, or general
        areas. Relate an unknown place to a better-known one. Example: Moody AFB is 10 miles north-
        east of Valdosta, GA. Include all geographical names in the gazetteer, if used (see 3.5.17.). Abbre-
        viate state names only when they follow the name of a town or city.
        3.5.11.8. Place lengthy statistics in charts, tables, or appendices; explain their significance and
        meaning in the narrative.
        3.5.11.9. Spell out numbers in the narrative when they begin a sentence and when they are less
        than 10. Use Arabic numbers to express units of time, weight, and measurement. Example: 8
        hours, 2,000 pounds, 20 feet.
        3.5.11.10. Use the 24-hour clock when referring to time, making clear whether the time is local
        (L) or Greenwich Mean Time, which is known in military terminology as Zulu (Z). Example:
        2130L or 2130Z.
        3.5.11.11. Single-space all quotations of five or more typed lines and indent them one half inch
        from both margins. Do not use long quotations, except where meaning would be lost or the value
        reduced significantly by paraphrasing or summarizing. Use an ellipsis, that is, three spaced dots
        (…), to indicate the omission of any words from a direct quotation. Use an ellipsis and a period
        (….), i.e., four spaced dots, to indicate an omission at the end of a sentence. Omissions must not
        change the meaning of the passage. Give every direct quotation a citation, that is, an acknowledg-
        ment of the source. Put a footnote reference number at the end of the quotation.
     3.5.12. Graphics. Use diagrams, illustrations, photographs, maps, tables, and similar materials to add
     clarity, interest, and conciseness to your narrative descriptions. Caption all graphics with dates, sub-
     jects, classification, downgrade and declassification instructions, administrative or special handling
     caveats. Indicate sources used and do not use color. When the periodic history is reproduced or micro-
     filmed in black and white, the legend will lose any meaning implied by the color.
     3.5.13. Photographs. Use only photographs of historical value. Do not embed them in an electronic
     history; use a hyperlinked caption instead.
        3.5.13.1. In captions, fully identify the who, what, when and where of the photograph.
        3.5.13.2. Use high-resolution digital images (at least 600 dots per inch) when possible to assure
        high quality reproduction of images included in the history.
        3.5.13.3. For a product being reproduced by high-resolution means, incorporate smaller photo-
        graphs or properly adjusted digital images into the layout of the manuscript.
        3.5.13.4. When available, place digital copies and prints of key photographs in an envelope at the
        back of volume one of the copy you send to AFHRA. Place identifying captions and classification
        data on the back of each print in a way that does not damage the picture.
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                            21


  3.5.14. Appendices. An appendix must be able to stand as an independent document when extracted
  from the history. It will list all sources used for its data and if classified, it will contain downgrade and
  declassification instructions. In electronic histories, the source citation will be hyperlinked to the cor-
  responding documents. Appropriate items for appendices include charts, tables, graphs, statistical
  summaries and compilations of details. Identify each appendix by a capital letter. The following
  appendices are mandatory:
      3.5.14.1. Appendix A is always Lineage and Honors data (see Attachment 8).
      3.5.14.2. Appendix B is always the Roster of Key Personnel (see Attachment 9).
      3.5.14.3. Appendix C is always Personnel Statistics of authorized and assigned (see Attachment
      10).
      3.5.14.4. Appendix D is always Organizational Structure Charts (see Attachment 11).
      3.5.14.5. MAJCOM/HOs may establish additional mandatory appendices based on their mis-
      sions.
  3.5.15. Footnotes. Cite sources of information in footnotes. Include hyperlinks to the documents cited
  in electronic histories. See Attachment 12 and Attachment 14.
  3.5.16. Glossary. List, in alphabetical order, frequently used abbreviations, acronyms, terms, and
  symbols, with a definition or explanation of each.
  3.5.17. Gazetteer (Optional). An alphabetical list of geographical place names with their locations is
  especially useful for organizations that are active overseas. Use the format in Attachment 13.
  3.5.18. List of Supporting Documents. In the printed narrative volume, list all supporting documents
  in numerical order, by chapter, giving the same identifying information and classification data
  required for a footnote. In histories not organized by chapter, number documents sequentially. In an
  electronic history, every citation must be hyperlinked to its corresponding document. In each printed
  supporting document volume, list only the documents contained in that volume, giving the same
  information required above. Use the format in Attachment 14.
  3.5.19. Index (Optional). An index is a helpful information-finding aid consisting of an alphabetical
  list of names and subjects from the text and the page numbers where they appear.
  3.5.20. Distribution List. Put a complete distribution list in the narrative volume. Include:
      3.5.20.1. The total number of volumes or CD/DVD and copies produced.
      3.5.20.2. The organization and office symbols for those receiving copies.
      3.5.20.3. The number of copies sent to each office.
      3.5.20.4. Use the format in Attachment 15.
  3.5.21. Supporting Documents. A solid collection of supporting documents constitutes an organized
  database that is the most valuable aspect of a periodic history. Select supporting documents that
  amplify the narrative or provide additional information likely to be needed for future reference and
  research.
      3.5.21.1. Organize and identify supporting documents consecutively by major portions of the
      product. Keep the numbering scheme consistent throughout all volumes of supporting documents.
      Include all G-series special orders (in numerical sequence) issued by or for the organization during
22                                                           AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007


      the period covered as the first supporting document in every periodic history. Individual award
      orders may be included.
      3.5.21.2. In printed volumes sent to AFHRA, use black ink to mark the supporting document
      number in the lower right corner of each page of every document to permit efficient identification
      on microfilm copies.
      3.5.21.3. Prepare a front cover and title page for each supporting document volume according to
      the instructions in 3.5.1. and 3.5.2. Each volume must contain a Security Notice and Administra-
      tive Controls page and a List of Supporting Documents prepared according to the instructions in
      3.5.3. and 3.5.18.
      3.5.21.4. Be sure that all supporting documents are legible for microfilming.
      3.5.21.5. Historians may organize a collection of well-chosen documents on a specific topic, nor-
      mally in chronological order, to maintain the integrity of the collection and to simplify document
      identification. Cite the entire collection in the footnotes rather than each individual document.
      Example: "See SD II-101 - SD II-121, info used is FOUO." The periodic history's List of Support-
      ing Documents in electronic form will include a complete document listing with hyperlinks to
      help researchers find specific documents.
      3.5.21.6. Reduce larger-than-standard paper, such as legal-sized documents, maps, and charts, to
      8.5- by 11-inch paper. To maintain quality and readability, bind odd-sized documents separately
      as a legal-sized volume, folding the documents carefully. Use the least number of folds possible.
      3.5.21.7. Copy documents that are smaller than standard size onto standard-sized paper. When the
      document is printed or written on only one side of the paper, tape all sides to a standard-sized sheet
      of bond paper with Magic Mending Tape. Don’t use cellophane tape because it deteriorates. Don’t
      cover information with the tape, even if it means leaving a side untaped. Don’t use staples or glue
      because staples rust and glue may damage the document.
      3.5.21.8. Bind bulky or oversized documents together in a separate volume, making sure that they
      can be read without disassembling the volume. If the margins are too small to permit reading with-
      out disassembling, extend the document’s cover by taping it to a piece of plain heavy paper that is
      similar in strength to the cover of a paperback book.
      3.5.21.9. Historical information is often not on paper. Examples: video and audiotapes, computer
      databases, microfilm and microfiche, slides, and other material. Convert essential audio and com-
      puterized information to paper products if possible. Include other forms of media as supporting
      documents only if they are of major historical value and only after checking with MAJCOM/HO
      and AFHRA.
      3.5.21.10. Place microfiche, flat film, transparencies, slides, and the like in a sturdy envelope
      made from acid-free paper. Then attach the envelope to a page as if it were a small document.
      Place the envelope flap to keep the contents from falling out. Items larger than standard size go in
      an oversize volume.
      3.5.21.11. When encountering valuable microfilm rolls, audio or videotapes, or other media con-
      tact MAJCOM/HO for guidance.

3.6. Formatting the Periodic Paper History:
AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007                                                                        23


   3.6.1. Page and Margin Specifications: Use 8.5- by 11-inch bond paper. Use a 1- inch margin on all
   sides of the page with .5 inch gutter. Set line spacing for narrative and footnote text at exactly 14
   points.
   3.6.2. Type Font and Size Specifications: Use a 12-point font or larger throughout the product,
   including footnote citations. Do not use smaller fonts; they are difficult to read on screen and on
   microfilm. Use a medium weight font for the majority of product to enhance readability when micro-
   filmed. This does not limit use of boldface fonts for headings. Don't use decorative or ornate type
   fonts.
   3.6.3. Page Numbering Specifications: Number front matter pages with lowercase Roman numerals
   at the bottom of page. Number narrative and back matter pages with Arabic numerals centered at the
   bottom of page or on the outside margin at the top of page. Be consistent throughout the product.
   Number pages consecutively throughout the entire narrative volume.
   3.6.4. Text Layout. Limit to single-column. Do not use multiple column layouts for normal text.

3.7. Review and Coordination.
   3.7.1. Coordinate draft portions of the periodic history with appropriate individuals or offices before
   submitting the product to the commander for review. Staff agencies ensure accuracy and complete-
   ness of the information and the security markings and handling instructions. They don't approve or
   disapprove topic selection or extent of coverage of specific topics in the narrative. The historian will
   present the staff's concerns and disagreements over these issues to the commander for resolution.
   3.7.2. Proofread and edit each periodic history before submitting it to the commander for review.
   Examine each history for accuracy of content and for compliance with the standards in this instruc-
   tion.
   3.7.3. The commander signs the title page, indicating final approval of the periodic history. In the
   event of an extended absence of the commander, the vice commander or second-in-command may
   sign the product. The title page is the only paper component of the electronic history. Once it is
   signed, a scanned digital copy must be included in the history.

3.8. Reproduction and Distribution.
   3.8.1. For paper-based products, prepare three copies of the narrative and two copies of the support-
   ing documents. Send two copies of the narrative and one copy of the supporting documents to MAJ-
   COM/HO, which will then forward a complete set to AFHRA/ISA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell
   AFB AL 36112-6424. Retain a complete set at the organization.
   3.8.2. Electronic histories will be recorded on standard CD-R/DVD-R discs; do not use CD/RW
   disks. Prepare three complete copies. Send two copies to the corresponding MAJCOM/HO. The MAJ-
   COM/HO will retain one copy and forward the other copy to AFHRA/ISA, 600 Chennault Circle,
   Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424. Retain a third copy at the organization.
   3.8.3. For additional copies, follow MAJCOM and unit policy on distribution. Comply with
   need-to-know criteria when distributing copies of classified histories. Consider producing unclassi-
   fied executive summaries, extracts of chapters or other portions on specific topics to permit wider dis-
   tribution.

3.9. Starting and Ending Periodic Histories. The periodic history of an activating unit begins on the
effective date of activation. The final periodic history of an inactivating unit covers activities through the
inactivation date.
     3.9.1. Ending Reports. Complete the periodic history of an inactivated, disbanded, or discontinued
     unit through the effective date of its termination. MAJCOM/HO determines the due date of the final
     (close-out) periodic history and ensures funding for completion of the close-out history is a top prior-
     ity. Ensure historical reporting procedures are included in planning and programming documents.
     3.9.2. Unit Redesignation. Upon redesignation, do not break the periodic history reporting cycle.
     Maintain a normal publication schedule. Submit the history for the period in which the redesignation
     occurred under the unit's new designation. Refer to the earlier designation on the title page. Example:
     999th Wing, formerly 999th Tactical Fighter Wing. Ensure the action is a redesignation and not the
     consolidation of two units or the organization of an entirely new unit.
     3.9.3. Unit Transfers. When a unit is transferred from one command to another, send completed peri-
     odic histories to the former command until the effective date of transfer. Send completed periodic his-
     tories to the new command after the effective date of transfer. Send copies of periodic histories on the
     transition period to the former command if requested.

Section 3B—Other Historical Products

3.10. Semiannual Historical Activity Reports. This report documents accomplishments and contribu-
tions by each headquarters and field history office and AFHRA. HQ USAF/HO uses it to provide data to
the Air Force leadership on the entire history program. Also, MAJCOM History offices use this data to
assist in the annual history awards program; therefore, historians at the wing/NAF level should ensure
their reports provide a detailed and accurate accounting of their historical services. Submit reports to

     historian workshops to gauge the management and operational effectiveness of subordinate history
     offices.
     3.15.2. MAJCOM/HOs. Conduct periodic staff visits to monitor the management and operation of
     subordinate offices. They assess periodic histories and other appropriate publications submitted by
     subordinate organizations within 60 days of receipt.
        3.15.2.1. The assessment criteria focuses on accuracy, objectivity, comprehensiveness, consis-
        tency, balance, analysis, clarity, security and administrative markings, selection of supporting
        documents, and format. The assessment states whether each periodic history exceeds, meets, or
        does not meet standards, as outlined in this publication. MAJCOM/HOs will determine whether
        the periodic histories that do not meet standards will be returned to the historian for reaccomplish-
        ment.
        3.15.2.2. The MAJCOM/HO prepares and sends two memoranda regarding the assessment. Send
        a brief memorandum to the organization's commander highlighting the overall assessment, key
        strengths, and recommended improvement areas. Send a detailed memorandum to the author out-
        lining specific findings. The detailed memorandum serves as a constructive training tool and
        includes suggestions for improvement. E-mail copies of both memoranda to HQ USAF/HO.

                      PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING UNIT HISTORIES
A2.1. (302AW) The following outline shows a suggested format and content examples. For more infor-
mation, refer to AFI 84-101, which describes unit histories in more detail. The Wing Historian will pro-
vide training and assistance as required.
A2.2. (302AW) All unit histories must arrive in the 302 AW History Office by close of business on the
third UTA following the close of their respective reporting period. In other words, history reports are due
on the September UTA for the preceding January through June and on the March UTA for July through
December of the preceding year.
A2.3. (302AW) Unit History Outline:
   A2.3.1. (302AW) Covers. Not required.
   A2.3.2. (302AW) Chronology. Listing, by date, of events occurring during the reporting period. Full,
   inclusive dates and declarative, complete sentences should be used.
   A2.3.3. (302AW) Narrative. Tells the reader what the unit did to perform its mission. Use simple,
   declarative sentences. Examples of headings in the narrative are: Introduction, Operations, Mainte-
   nance and Personnel. Use these or any other appropriate titles to the unit and its mission.
   A2.3.4. (302AW) Appendices. Only two are required: the unit’s lineage and honors statement, and a
   listing of key personnel. This listing should include full name (first, middle initial, and last)
   A2.3.5. (302AW) Glossary. Required only for unit-specific terms.
   A2.3.6. (302AW) Supporting Document. Required only to support specific unit events, such as Spe-
   cial Orders pertaining to unit members, citations, and so on. In short, if the unit history asserts a fact,
   there should be documentation to back it up.

13 Dec 91-      (U) The 49th Fighter Wing (FW) conducted a local Bold Shield exercise.            16
17 Jan 92       This exercise successfully tested the wing’s ability to deploy, sustain
                operations in a bare-base location, and survive-to-operate after a simulated
                attack.


1 Jan           (U) As part of an Air Force-directed plan to improve oversight of service          8
                providers, Air Combat Command activated the 93d Contracting Squadron
                and assigned it to the 49 FW. The wing appointed Lt Col Edward F. Hutton
                as the new squadron’s first commander.


2-4 Mar         (U) By participating in a special mission called SNOWTIME, the 49 FW set          32
                a new endurance record. The aircrew, commanded by Maj Charles E. Brown
                III, flew non-stop to Australia, a 15-hour flight.


24 Jun           (U) The 49 FW participated in a Major Accident Response Exercise that
                highlighted the recent expansion of crash rescue capabilities.1

                                               CHAPTER I
                                        Mission and Organization


        (U) American airmen had no experience before World War II with the special problems that face
peacetime military forces operating from foreign bases. When the war began in Europe in 1939, about
4,000 of the 26,000-member American air force operated outside the country. However, all forces were
based on U.S. possessions -- the Philippines, Hawaii, and the Panama Canal Zone--where they provided
aerial reconnaissance and "flying artillery" for Army garrisons stationed there to safeguard American
interests.1


        (U) The situation changed quickly after the fall of France in 1940. By the time the Japanese struck
at Pearl Harbor, Army Air Forces (AAF) fighter and transport aircraft had moved or were preparing to
move onto bases in Canada (Newfoundland, Labrador) and the Caribbean that President Franklin D.
Roosevelt obtained through his famed destroyers-for-bases deal with Great Britain. The great wartime
expansion began in early 1942 when AAF strategic bomber forces moved to England, while airmen who
survived the fall of the Philippines joined forces fresh from the United States in Australia and New
Guinea to begin a buildup that eventually smashed Japan into surrender.2 At war’s end, nearly 1,000,000
of AAF’s 2,250,000 men operated from nearly 500 major air bases on foreign soil.3

                                     eagle volant, azure, highlighted bluebird, his wings
                                     superimposed over the border, airlifting with his talons a sphere
                                     of the second, fimbriated, longitude, latitude lines, grappling
                                     iron attached to upper area of sphere, all of the fourth.

Insert Emblem Here                   Significance: The white and blue symbolize the sky and clouds,
                                     the theater where our Airlift mission is performed. The
                                     American bald eagle, our National bird, carrying the globe, with
                                     his talons, symbolically indicates our global airlift support. Of
                                     the noble virtues, blue symbolizes vigilance, perseverance, and
                                     justice; white, the heraldic representation of silver, is for purity;
                                     and yellow, the heraldic representation of gold is for knowledge
                                     and enlightenment

                                     Motto: Robustum Auxilium “Powerful Support”

                                INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOOTNOTES

A12.1. Footnotes provide the primary means of identifying sources of information. In addition, authors
may use explanatory footnotes for reasons of style or organization. For example, an explanatory footnote
can be used for a long list of names that would clutter up the text or to define technical terms.

A12.2. Number footnotes consecutively through each chapter. If chapter divisions are not used, number
footnotes consecutively through the entire text. Numbers must be superscripted and precede note num-
bers.
   A12.2.1. Call attention to a note by inserting a footnote in the text immediately following the appro-
   priate clause or phrase, without spacing.
   A12.2.2. Footnote citations indicate if the source has been attached to the product as a supporting
   document (SD) in paper-based products by identifying the SD number at the end of the citation. This
   identification will be the last item in the citation, use the SD prefix, and underline the entire number.
   Examples: SD SO-1, SD CHR-13, SD III-87, SD 116. In electronic products, create a hyperlink to the
   document at the end of the citation.
   A12.2.3. Cite the source of every direct quotation. Footnote numbers are placed at the end of indented
   quotations.

A12.3. Footnotes placed at the bottom of the appropriate pages are the user-friendliest method to help
researchers, especially on microfilm, scanned, and electronic images find the sources used to prepare the
narrative. Use footnotes without exception.

A12.4. Note citations must be brief; however, cite all pertinent documents using the standard formats
outlined in this instruction. Use abbreviations, acronyms, and other office symbols whenever possible to
shorten citations; however, do not allow brevity to cause future researchers problems in identifying infor-
mation sources.

A12.5. Footnotes must contain all the data needed to identify the source. All citations must follow these
guidelines: type of document; classification; warning notices or special notations (caveats); downgrade
and declassification instructions; originating organization and office; receiving organization and office;
subject in quotes; (for lengthy documents) volume, section or paragraph number; and date or date-time
group.
   A12.5.1. Indicate the nature of the source (letter, memo, report, press release, and so on). For exam-
   ple: “Memo.”
   A12.5.2. Source citations must contain the document’s classification, downgrade and declassification
   instructions, warning notices, and special administrative handling caveats. Place these markings in
   parentheses immediately after the type of document, followed by a comma. Example: “Memo (S/
   DECL 20 Mar 83),.”
   A12.5.3. Always include the originating office. Include receiving office(s) as appropriate. End with a
   comma. Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), Col A.B. Smith, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV,.”
48                                                             AFI84-101_302AW_I 6 JANUARY 2007


        A12.5.3.1. Include names as appropriate, especially on personal correspondence. Example:
        “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), Col A.B. Smith, 10 BW/CC, to Col Charles D. Bower, 10 BW/
        CV,.”
        A12.5.3.2. When the correspondence goes to a long list of recipients, cite the first one on the list
        and then the term et al. (Note: In some instances, such as staff summary sheets, list the final, most
        important recipient on the list.)
        Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al.,.”
     A12.5.4. Always include the subject when citing military correspondence. Place titles in quotation
     marks and end with a comma. For classified documents, include the classification of the title. Exam-
     ple: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5
     Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U),."
        A12.5.4.1. Provide a short, accurate descriptive subject, placed in brackets without capitalization,
        if the subject does not appear on the document.
        A12.5.4.2. Recommend providing short, accurate and unclassified descriptive subject when the
        subject would normally be classified.
        Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., [exercise bingo (U)],.”
        A12.5.4.3. Designate exact titles of published works (printed books, pamphlets, magazines, and
        newspapers) by italics (for word processed material) or underlining (for typed material). Use quo-
        tation marks around titles of chapters, articles, notes, documents, reports, and the like.
     A12.5.5. Whenever possible, give the exact title, volume, and page number or numbers. End with a
     comma. This is especially true when citing a historical report prepared in the field, or other recurring
     publication. Example: Hist (S/NF/DECL X4), 20 TFW, Jan-Jun 63, Vol. I, pp 2-14. Provide page
     numbers for direct quotations. Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et
     al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U)," p.15,.”
     A12.5.6. Include date or date-time group (for messages), followed by a comma. Use a period if this
     completes the citation (see A12.5.7. to A12.5.8.). Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC
     to 10 BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U)," p.15, 20 Mar 63,.”
        A12.5.6.1. If the document is not dated and an approximate date is known, use "circa" -- abbrevi-
        ated "ca." -- plus the approximate date. Example: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10
        BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U)," p.15, ca. 20 Mar 63,.”
        A12.5.6.2. If the date is unknown, use "n.d." (no date) as a last resort. Example: “Memo (S/DECL
        20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U),"
        p.15, n.d.,.”
     A12.5.7. Source citations must explain or verify any differences between the classification or special
     notations of the source(s) cited applied to the narrative and other portions of the report. If the cited
     information comes from an portion other than the most restrictive of that document, use the notation
     "unclassified extract" or "(info used is (classification))" immediately after the citation. Example:
     “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28

   A12.5.8. Separate individual citations by semicolons in notes that cite more than one source. Exam-
   ple: “Memo (S/DECL 20 Mar 83), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5
   Jan-28 Feb 1963 (U)," p.15, 20 Mar 63, SD II-15, (info used is U); Intvw (U), W. Bowles, ACC/HO,
   with Maj Bryan K. Edwards, ACC/SC, 6 Dec 92, SD II-24.”

A12.6. Single-space the text of each footnote. Indent the numbers or symbols five spaces double-spacing
between footnotes.

A12.7. For textual matter within your footnotes (as distinguished from document citations), write in the
same style used in the narrative. Place all direct quotations in footnotes within quotation marks, regardless
of length.

A12.8. Provide a complete bibliographical citation the first time any source is mentioned in a chapter.
Use shortened titles sparingly. Shortened titles can be used for frequently cited works after the first com-
plete citation. Identify short titles by placing them in brackets immediately after the full citation. Exam-
ple: Rpt (S/DECL X4), Col A.B. Smith, 509 BW/CC, "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1996,"
[hereafter cited as Smith Rpt on Exercise Bingo] p 15.

A12.9. Designate exact titles of published works, printed books, pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers,
by italics. Use quotation marks around titles of chapters, articles, footnotes, documents, reports, and the
like.

A12.10. When citing a historical report prepared in the field give the exact title, volume, and page num-
ber or numbers. Example: Hist (S/NF/DECL X4), 20 FW, Jan-Jun 99, Volume I, pp 2-14.

A12.11. Use the following format when citing a study that has been completed and bound: Study (U),
John C. Warren, Airborne Operations in World War II, European Theater (USAF Historical Study 97, Sep
56), p 42.

A12.12. Indicate the nature of the source. If a term like "Report" is part of the title, place it with the rest
of the title. If it is used only descriptively, place it before the title, abbreviated and followed by a comma.

A12.13. Classification markings and other restrictions must precede narrative statements in explanatory
footnotes. Example: 23 (U) Offensive Counter Air consists of an operation mounted to destroy, disrupt, or
limit enemy air power as close to its source as possible. Additionally, source citations must contain the
document’s classification, downgrade and declassification instructions, warning notices, and special
administrative handling caveats. Place these markings in parentheses immediately after the type of docu-
ment. Example: Ltr (S/NF/DECL X4).
   A12.13.1. Source citations must explain or verify any differences between the classification or spe-
   cial notations of the sources cited and as applied to the narrative or other portions of the report. For
   example, if the cited information comes from an unclassified portion of a classified document, use the
   notation "information used is U" immediately after the citation.
   A12.13.2. When using footnotes in classified products, mark each footnote with its classification, for
   instance, (U), immediately following the note number to comply with security portion marking
   requirements. In particular, a classified title would cause a footnote to become a classified portion.

A12.14. Always include the subject when citing military correspondence. Provide a short, accurate
descriptive subject, placed in brackets without capitalization, if the subject does not appear on the docu-
ment. Use extreme caution when substituting a title in brackets in the place of a classified title.

A12.15. Indicate the place and date of publication, volume, and page numbers for information from a
published book.

A12.16. In footnotes that cite more than one source, separate individual citations by semicolons—these
footnotes are called multiple source citations.

A12.17. Use the italicized abbreviation Ibid. (meaning "in the same place") only when the preceding note
has a single source citation. If referring to all the citations in the preceding multiple source citation foot-
note, use "See note above."

A12.18. The following note citations demonstrate many of the combinations needed for periodic history
footnotes.
     A12.18.1. Documents with Attachments. Use this form when citing a document with attachments.
     Use the whole package as a supporting document.
     SSS w/2 atchs (S/DECL X4), ACC/DO to NORAD/J5, "Alert Base Expansion (U)," 2 Oct 97; Atch 1
     Memo (S/DECL X4), 1 AF/CC to ACC/DO, "Alert Base Expansion (U)," 1 Jul 97; Atch 2 Brfg (S/
     DECL X4), 1 AF/CC, “Expansion of Alert Bases (U),” 15 Aug 97, SD III-118. Note: when citing
     complete document packages, it isn’t necessary to identify attachments individually. Instead, simply
     cite the SSS w/2 Atchs. By the same token, if the other components are not historically significant,
     retain and cite only the attachment and list the item as a separate document.
