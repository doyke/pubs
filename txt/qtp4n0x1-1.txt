1. These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for
Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the
breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the
trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by
the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party
certification.

2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job
position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are
the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in
performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide.

3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the
training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has
any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the
performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some
objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize
training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform
the task without assistance.

4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow
the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task
objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion on
AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.

5. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation.
Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the 6-
part folder. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task,
he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.

6. If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying
official, the trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without
assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which
require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education
and Training Plan (CFETP).

9. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such
standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These
documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist
each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a
usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-
job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise,
and we encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:

                  CLEAN ITEMS FOR DISINFECTION
Preparatory Phase
1. Don personal protective equipment (PPE) that is required for cleaning
   and decontamination; explain why this PPE is needed.
2. Explain the differences between cleaning and decontamination.
3. Explain why mechanical decontamination methods are preferred over
   manual disinfection methods. Cite examples of items that must be
   manually cleaned and decontaminated, and explain why.
4. Inspect items to ensure that gross contaminants were removed at point
   of use. Follow locally established protocol for processing grossly
   contaminated items
5. Perform pre-soaking/pre-rinsing (if local policy dictates).
Mechanical Cleaning and Decontamination
1. Describe the function and explain the proper use for each of the
   following types of equipment:
   a. Washer-sterilizer
   b. Washer-decontaminator
   c. Ultrasonic cleaner
2. Inspect items to ensure that they are properly arranged for mechanical
   cleaning and decontamination; correct discrepancies IAW local policy.
   a. Items should be placed in perforated containers such as pans, trays,
       or baskets.
   b. Heavy instruments either should be separated from lighter ones or
       the heavy items should be placed in the bottom of the container with
       lighter items on top.
   c. Sharp or pointed items should be placed either in separate
       containers or placed on top of all other items. Sharp or pointed areas
       must not be damaged by contact with other instruments and must be
       arranged in a manner which will not injure processing area
       personnel.
   d. Concave item surfaces should face down or to the side to allow
       solution to flow through rather than pool on the surface.
   e. Hinged instruments should be open with ratchets disengaged;
       ringed instruments may be on a stringer to help hold them open.
   f. Multi-part instruments should be disassembled; ensure that small
       pieces are safely contained to prevent loss.
   g. All items should be neatly arranged; they should not be randomly
       piled in the container. Do not overload the instrument trays.
   h. Avoid mixing instruments made of dissimilar metals in the same
       load.

   and low-sudsing detergent. Be certain that this detergent will leave no
   residue.
2. Keep all items immersed (except for those that cannot be immersed,
   such as air-powered instruments), and guard against splashing the
   solution while manually washing items.
3. Use a soft-bristle brush to clean the box locks, ratchets, serrations, and
   other hard-to-reach places on instruments and glassware. Never use
   steel wool, abrasive pads, or other abrasive agents to scrub surgical
   instruments on a routine basis.
4. Clean delicate microsurgery instruments (such as those used for eye or
   neurosurgery) IAW the manufacturer’s directions.
5. Always grasp delicate instruments by their handles; do not allow them
   to strike each other/other objects as you clean them.
6. Clean air-powered instruments IAW to the manufacturer’s directions.
7. Thoroughly rinse all items with hot water to remove all matter; then
   allow the instruments to dry.
