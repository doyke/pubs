                  CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN


Part I
1. Preface.
 1.1.1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education
 and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training
 support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will
 provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career
 field training. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty
 position qualification training.
 1.1.2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control training within
 the specialty using both parts of the plan.
   1.1.2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
   Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field
   progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path;
   Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
   experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples
   are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide
   requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
   1.1.2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard
   (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and
   Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and
   correspondence course requirements. Section B: contains the course objective list and training
   standards which supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements.
   Section C: identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training
   Package (QTPs which may be developed to support proficiency training); Section D identifies
   a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support
   training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. At unit level, supervisors
   and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the
   overall goals of this plan. Section F explains the approved method of documenting training, as
   well as information pertaining to specific training programs.
 1.1.3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
 effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us
 to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

1.2. General Information.
 1.2.1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field
 Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training
 managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and
 efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS
 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies
 initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills training is
 the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon
 retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted
 by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory
 courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements
 for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task
 performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training
 program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the

                                                  4
 performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty
 training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence
 or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to
 increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has
 several purposes--some are:
  1.2.1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-
  training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point
  in an individual’s career.
  1.2.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the
  specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s
  career.
  1.2.1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
  training delivery method.
  1.2.1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired
  career field training process.
 1.2.2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
 comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the
 specialty.
  1.2.2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field
  and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in
  Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies
  for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
  1.2.2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
  upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, and contract training or
  exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to
  support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.
  1.2.2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this
  plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
 1.2.3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM
 will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM
 representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
 training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

1.3.2. Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the
apprentice to the superintendent level play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to
accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training must do his or her part
to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part
of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their
career.
 1.3.2.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the task and
 knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level resident course (J3ABR4V031) located at
 Sheppard AFB, TX. The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge items in the initial
 skills course is based on a review of occupational survey report (OSR) data, training
 requirements analysis (TRA) data, and 4V0X1 subject-matter expert (SME) input. Task and
 knowledge training requirements are identified in the specialty training standard, Part II,
 Section 4B. Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 4V031.
 1.3.2.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade to the 5-level consists of: (1) Completing all STS
 core tasks. (2) Completion of all duty position tasks specified in the STS. (3) Completing 15
 months of upgrade training (9 months for retrainees). (4) Completion of the Career
 Development Course (4V051 A and B courses). (5) Must have recommendation of supervisor
 and meet all other requirements as outlined in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel


                                                6
(Officer and Enlisted). Please refer to AFI 36-2201, volumes 2 and 3 for further information.
Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a journeyman will maintain proficiency by completing all
continuation training required or specified by command or local policies. Individuals will use
their CDCs to prepare for testing and promotion under the Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS). They are also encouraged to continue their education toward an Ophthalmic
Technician CCAF degree. Journeymen are eligible to apply for an instructor position with the
Ophthalmic Apprentice Course. Additional qualification may become necessary when
personnel transfer to a new duty position, or when new equipment, techniques, procedures, or
training requirements are introduced. “If an ophthalmic technician receives orders to an
Ophthalmology Clinic and they have never worked in ophthalmology prior, they will receive
ophthalmologic operation room training through their career development course and on-the-
job training from 4N1surgical technicians. With the Optometry/Ophthalmology merger to
Ophthalmic Technician effective 31 Oct 06, the only change to the procedure is in who
receives the training. Previously it was optometry technicians right out of technical school
(new airmen or higher ranking if cross-trainees) that required the training. Now it will be any
ophthalmic technician PCSing into a location with ophthalmology if they’ve never worked in
ophthalmology before.” Journeymen may be assigned supervisory duties and perform
various ophthalmic and administrative tasks. Individuals who are in the rank of SrA will
attend ALS after having 48 months time in service (TIS). Resident graduation is a
prerequisite for SSgt sew-on and applies to active duty only. National certification is highly
encouraged.
1.3.2.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Upgrade to the 7-level consists of: (1) Completion of all STS
core tasks. (2) Completion of all duty position tasks specified in the STS. (3) Completion of
12 months of upgrade training (6 months for retrainees). (4) Completion of the Career
Development Course (4V071). (5) Must receive ophthalmic certification from a nationally
accredited body (i.e. JCAHPO, AOA, or ABO). (6) Must be a SSgt. (7) Must have
recommendation of supervisor and meet all other requirements as outlined in AFI 36-2101,
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Please refer to AFI 36-2201, volumes
2 and 3, for further information. An Ophthalmic Craftsman can be expected to fill various
supervisory and management positions within the ophthalmic service. In addition, they can
be assigned to fill additional duty positions or work in various group or squadron positions at
the MTF when required. Craftsmen should take courses or obtain added knowledge on
management of resources and personnel. Continued academic education through CCAF and
higher degree programs is encouraged. Advanced certification in optometry or
ophthalmology is highly recommended. 7-levels can be appointed as OJT certifiers upon
completion of the Air Force Training Course. Individuals will use the most current CDCs and
any other references to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS) for promotion to TSgt and MSgt. In addition, TSgt and TSgt selectees will attend
the Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA). Resident graduation is a prerequisite for
MSgt sew-on and applies to active duty only. Individuals should enroll in the SNCOA
correspondence course upon selection to MSgt.
1.3.2.4. Superintendent (9) Level. To be awarded AFSC 4V091, an individual must be an E8
and complete any other requirements specified in the Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory (AFECD). A 9-level can be expected to fill positions such as Superintendent of the
Ophthalmic Flight, superintendent of any one of the medical squadrons, or superintendent of a
group and any other DoD ophthalmic positions. Additional training in areas of budget,
manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing

                                             7
education. To assume the rank of CMSgt, individuals must be graduates of the SNCOA
resident course; this applies to active duty only.
1.3.2.5. Base Level Senior 4V:
7-Skill level and 3 years experience as a 4V required to perform duties as Senior 4V. 9-Skill
level preferred.
The senior 4V should be appointed by the MDG Commander. The senior 4V shall provide
supply and equipment oversight, training and other vision program oversight, and may
execute technician duties in both optometry and ophthalmology clinics in times of manning
crisis. The senior 4V will recommend to squadron and medical group leaders which available
technicians should work in each clinic and when to rotate technicians between clinics to
maintain the best overall skills for all 4V technicians. Historically, there has been friction
between optometry and ophthalmology professions. This is further complicated with each
clinic belonging to a different squadron.
The MDG Senior 4V will coordinate with the MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager on issues
concerning training and all matters that impact the Vision mission capability at the base they
are assigned. The MDG senior 4V should, at a minimum, make every effort to communicate
with the MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager and MDG Superintendent on a monthly basis.

The MDG Senior 4V may assign duties and responsibilities to the 4Vs assigned to their base.
The MDG Senior 4V may be assigned duties by clinic, squadron and MDG leadership and the
MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager. If these duties are mutually exclusive, the MDG Senior
4V needs to coordinate the assigned duties with the parties that assigned the duties.

1.3.2.6. MAJCOM Functional Manager Duties:
9-Skill level. 7-Skill level and 6 years experience as a 4V required to perform duties as
MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager.

This person is recommended by the 4V AFCFM and appointed by the MAJCOM SG. The
MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager works with the Senior 4V at each military installation of
that MAJCOM to represent their needs and issues to the MAJCOM SG’s office. This is
normally accomplished through the MAJCOM Chief of Medical Enlisted Issues (CMEI).
Also, the MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager keeps the AFCFM informed of issues in that
MAJCOM.

The MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager may receive assignments from the MAJCOM or the
AFCFM. In the event both offices assign duties that are mutually exclusive, contact both
offices for guidance. The MAJCOM 4V Functional Manager should, at a minimum, make
every effort to communicate with the AFCFM and the MAJCOM CMEI on a monthly basis.
1.3.2.7. Career Field Manager Duties:
Must be a senior career AFMS senior NCO (MSgt-CMSgt) who has demonstrated
outstanding competence and has full knowledge of the professional, technical, and
administrative aspects of his/her specialty.
Must have demonstrated competence in positions of increasing professional,
clinical/technical, or administrative responsibility. Should have two years’ retainability. Must
have at least 7 years experience in the career field. Must be recommended by SG Chief
Consultant for related medical officer specialty and the Chief, Medical Enlisted Issues.

                                              8
 Technical or academic training background (as instructor and/or course developer) highly
 desirable, but not mandatory. Must possess a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)
 degree in the specialty. Completion of Air Force Senior NCO Academy correspondence or in
 residence is mandatory. Experience as MAJCOM, Lead Agent, Air Staff action officer/staff
 member highly desirable, but not mandatory. Must meet all Air Force Standards.

 The 4V Air Force Career Field Manager is nominated by the Optometry Consultant, the
 Ophthalmology Consultant and the outgoing Career Field Manager to the AF/SG. The
 AF/SG appoints the AFCFM for a three year tour (subject to change). The AF/SG or
 representatives may assign tasks to the CFM.

 Generally, AFCFM is also the MDG Senior 4V at their installation or may be assigned to
 another Chief duty position. Local MDG leaders must acknowledge that there will be times
 when AF level duties must take priority over locally assigned duties. Reference document:
 AFI 44-104.
1.3.3. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Ophthalmic career field. The
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The
strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a
disjointed approach to training. The following training decisions were made during the AFSC
4V0X1 Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW), held 11 thru 15 July 2005 at Sheppard
AFB.

 1.3.3.1. Initial Skills. The Ophthalmic Service Apprentice Course was revised to meet new
 training requirements identified in the 2005 4V031 Job and Occupational Survey Reports.
 The initial skills course provides airmen the needed education, motivation and training
 necessary to become 3-level apprentices.
 1.3.3.2. Five-Level Upgrade Requirements. The 4V051 CDC will become the first course
 taken in 5-level training, 4V051 course A to meet new training requirements, update
 technology, and regulatory information. Knowledge for upgrade training to the 5-level will
 expand on subject and task knowledge from initial skills training. The 5-level CDC course B
 expands the areas of specific ophthalmology clinical testing tasks, microbiology, assisting in
 ophthalmic surgery and aseptic technique. The CDCs provide upgrade training on those tasks
 supported by Occupational Survey Report (OSR) data and are identified in the STS. Most
 tasks for upgrade training to the 5-level will expand on subject and task knowledge from
 initial skills training. Completion of both courses of the CDC is mandatory for upgrade to the
 5-skill level.
 1.3.3.3. Seven-Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Individuals must complete the
 Ophthalmic Craftsman CDC and obtain nationally accredited ophthalmic certification. This
 course provides the education and training skills needed to become a craftsman. The 7-level
 CDC (4V071) provides curriculum in the areas of technology updates, AFSC specific
 supervision and management, including the budget process, the contact lens program, work
 assignments, and conducting training within the scope of medical treatment facilities (MTFs).
 1.3.3.4. Proficiency Training. Any additional knowledge and skill requirements not taught
 through initial skills or upgrade training were assigned as continuation training. The purpose
 of continuation training is to provide additional training exceeding the minimum upgrade

                                              9
  training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions. Individual
  ophthalmic service managers must develop a continuation-training program ensuring
  individuals in the ophthalmic service career field receive the necessary training at the
  appropriate point in their careers. The training program will identify both mandatory and
  optional training. National accreditation continuation education hours from all certifying
  agencies are acceptable. However, note only AOA accepts training from other agencies.
   1.3.3.4.1. Certification. Ophthalmic technicians are required to obtain certification prior to
   7-level upgrade through any accredited agency covering their specialty. MTFs may fund
   certification tests and should be used as the first route for testing reimbursement. See AFI
   41-104, “Professional Board and National Certification Examinations” for further guidance.
   As of 4 March 2002, certification tests given by the American Optometric Association have
   been approved under Section 3689 for test fee reimbursement with tuition assistance (TA) or
   GI Bill funds for eligible examinees. The approved certification tests are: Certified
   Paraoptometric (CPO) examination, Certified Paraoptometric Assistant (CPOA)
   Examination, and the Certified Paraoptometric Technician (COPT) Examination. JCAHPO
   certifies the Ophthalmic Assistant.
1.3.4. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon
completion of Basic Military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of
Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the
following:
  1.3.4.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification
  training, consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF
  instructors who possess an associates degree or higher may be nominated by their school
  commander and commandant for certification as an occupational instructor.
  1.3.4.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
  certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a
  competency based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency
  levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager). All
  are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.
  1.3.4.3. Degree Requirements: All airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program.
  Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-level must be awarded and the following
  requirements must be met:

 2.1. Section A--Specialty Training Standard.



                                                 19
2.1.1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for
classes beginning 12 Mar 07 and graduating 24 May 07.
2.1.2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, volume 5, this STS:
 2.1.2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common
 tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in
 the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1., 1.2., 2.1. Column 2
 Core Tasks identified, by letter (C), specialty-wide training requirements. War time tasks are
 identified by letter (W).
 2.1.2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
 knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
 technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or
 completed date. (As a minimum, use the following column designators: Training Complete,
 Certifier Initials.)
 2.1.2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
 proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task
 and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.

 2.1.2.4. Qualitative Requirements. The STS contains the proficiency code key used to indicate
 the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development
 courses.
 2.1.2.5. Use to document task when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and
 used according to AFI 36-2201, volume 3.

  2.1.2.5.1. Documentation. See AFI 36-2201, volume 3 paragraph 7.8.1.

  2.1.2.5.2. CFETP Transcribing Procedures. See AFI 36-2201, volume 3 paragraph 7.8.2.

  2.1.2.5.3. Decertification and Recertification. See AFI 36-2201, volume 3 paragraph
  7.8.4.

  2.1.2.5.4. Performance Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go. Go means the
  individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,
  timeliness, and correct use of procedures. (Go level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency
  code key).
 2.1.2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman
 Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF
 Occupational Measurement Squadron, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in
 their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test
 development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions
 are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. WAPS is not applicable to the
 Air National Guard.

2.1.3. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates
(identify complete AETC technical school’s mailing address). Reference specific STS
paragraphs.

* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
specific task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
task, or for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.

2.2. Section B--Course Objective List.
 2.2.1. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject
 knowledge, which is measured using a written test. PC indicates required task performance,
 which is measured with a performance progress check. P indicates required task performance,
 which is measured with a performance test. PC/W indicates separate measurement of both
 knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.

 2.2.2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
 measurements are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
 Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be
 required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

 2.2.3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which
 means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
 the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing
 the task.

2.6. Section F - Documentation of Training (Medical Specific)

2.6.1. Development of a Work Center Training Plan and the Enlisted Training and Competency
Folder. AFI 36-2201, volume 3, paragraph 7.4 authorizes Career Field Managers to bring
training documentation back into one “OJT” record, thus the creation of the Enlisted Training
and Competency Folder. The following training information provides specific guidance along
with recommended documentation, consistent with current Air Force instruction/directives. All
enlisted personnel assigned to this specialty will have an Enlisted Training and Competency
Folder, from airman basic to chief master sergeant. The folders will be kept current for present
duty position. It is recommended that the folder be maintained for future use if the individual
leaves the career field. This training guidance has focused on two main areas: 1) Master
Training Plan and 2) Documentation of training in the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.
Although not mandated, each part of the competency folder may contain separate indexed tabs or
tabbed dividers for the documentation of different categories of training.

2.6.2. Master Training Plan (MTP) (reference AFMAN 36-2234, AFI 36-2201 Vol 3, and AFH
36-2235 Vol 11).

2.6.2.1. The Master Training Plan is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets

                                                    66
of training for individuals assigned. It is to be used as a reference source for the type of training and
documentation pertaining to each assigned member. The MTP is also used as a means to reduce the
amount of paperwork previously required during the training process.

2.6.2.2. The Master Training Plan is an overview of training for the duty section. It should
include all documents involved in the training process for the duty section. Training will vary
from section to section and person to person, but there are certain documents that will be a
standard requirement for all MTPs. They are listed below:

2.6.2.2.1. Master Task List

2.6.2.2.2. Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP)

2.6.2.2.3. Locally developed AF Form 797s

2.6.2.2.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (refer to AFI 36-2201, Vol 3, Chap 6)

2.6.2.2.5. Unit Specific Orientation Checklist

2.6.2.2.6. Job descriptions/performance standards

2.6.2.2.7. Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) required to perform peacetime/wartime duties

2.6.3. Documentation of Training, The Enlisted Training and Competency Folder: The purpose
of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the forms used
in training all enlisted ophthalmic personnel. Training documentation helps to assess readiness
capability, individual strengths and weaknesses, and resources needed to support quality patient
care. It also aids in compliance with all Health Services Inspections, Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and other regulatory requirements. The Enlisted
Training and Competency Folder are limited to the forms presented here and those prescribed in
AFI 36-2201, volume 3. The unit training manager can provide assistance with training
documentation.

2.6.4. Documents included in the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.

2.6.4.1. To assemble a training record, use a standard 6-part folder (NSN 7530-00-990-8884,
Folder, 6 Section). Attach a computer generated or typewritten label with “Enlisted Training and
Competency Folder” centered on the top of the label and the individual’s name (last name, first
name, middle initial), and SSAN (last four only) on the bottom of the label. This label is placed
in the center of the front cover as viewed in the portrait orientation. An AFVA 205-15,
“PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT”, is centered on the bottom half of the folder. Other sections of
the 6-part folder are discussed in detail in the paragraphs below. When multiple copies of any
form are placed in the OJT record, they are placed in chronological order with the most current
documentation on top. When building the new 6-part folder, the parts of the folder will contain
the documents filed in the sequence shown in Figure 2-1.

                                         (Trainee Orientation)


______________________________ has been briefed on the On-The-Job Training (OJT) Program and
how he/she fits into the program while in upgrade training (UGT). Upgrade training was explained as a
dual channel process designed to qualify an airman for skill level upgrade. Dual channel OJT is a
systematic reportable application of self-study and the craftsman/apprentice principle. Trainees acquire
job qualification while performing on the job under supervision. This combination, knowledge and job
position qualification constitutes the dual channel concept. Requirements from AFI 36-2101, AFI 36-
2201, and AFECD were covered. AF Forms 623, 623a, 797, 2096, and the CFETP, STS/JQS or
automated JQS, which serves to make up the individual training record, was explained. Responsibilities
of the commander, base training, unit education and training manager (ETM), immediate supervisor,
trainer, and trainee were discussed. The career development course (CDC) was briefly discussed and is
explained in detail when the CDC arrives. Requirements for upgrade in your AFSC ____________ are:
(1) Satisfactory completion of 5-level CDC ___________ (2) Supervisor certifies job qualifications with
adequate hands on training (3) Satisfactory completion of 7-level CDC ___________, and (4) Supervisor
recommendation for upgrade. Each airman in grades E1 through E6 (and SNCO’s in retraining status)
has an AF Form 623, which must contain a CFETP or JQS. The CFETP or JQS may contain 150 or more
separate tasks but it should be annotated to show only those tasks the airman is required to perform in
his/her current duty position, all AFECD mandatory requirements for upgrade and core task requirements.
In the JQS there is a space for both the supervisor and the trainee to initial and certify training is
complete. In the CFETP, the trainer, trainee, and certifier have a space to initial when training is
completed. After upgrade training is complete, the CFETP or JQS will continue to document further
qualification training.
