                    INTRODUCTION AND EXCEPTION PROGRAM

Section 1A—Explosives Safety General Instructions

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this Manual is to implement, according to AFPD 91-2, the Air
Force Weapons Safety program to:
      1.1.1. Provide the maximum possible protection to personnel and property, both inside
      and outside the installation, from the damaging effects of potential accidents involving
      ammunition and explosives (AE).
   1.1.2. Expose the minimum number of people to the minimum amount of AE for the
   minimum amount of time consistent with safe and efficient operations. This maxim is
   known as the cardinal principle of explosives safety.
   1.1.3. AE safety standards herein should be considered minimum standards.            Greater
   protection should be provided when practicable.
   1.1.4. Observe explosives safety practices during all operations that include the use of live
   explosives.
   1.1.5. Comply with DoD and Air Force explosives safety and environmental standards.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. The provisions of this Manual apply:
      1.2.1.1. Whenever any explosives, propellant, or similar Hazard Class 1 energetic
      materials or other ammunition items in Classes 2 through 9 (see paragraph 3.5.1.2) are
      present on Air Force-owned or -leased facilities (except as allowed in paragraph 1.2.1.3),
      or are in the custody and control of Air Force civilian or military personnel.
      1.2.1.2. Whenever United States (US)-titled AE are in the custody of Air Force civilian
      or military personnel, or Air Force contractors (except as allowed in paragraph 1.2.1.3).
      1.2.1.3. At Air Force-owned and contractor-operated facilities, as specified by contract.
      Explosives safety requirements and procedures for compliance with current DoD and AF
      guidance shall be clearly specified in the contract. The contracting officer provides
      appropriate portions of DoD 4145.26-M, DoD Contractors Safety Manual for
      Ammunition and Explosives to the contractor. Weapons safety personnel from the
      organization responsible for the contract will advise the contractor on DoD and Air Force
      explosives safety standards specified in the contract. In the event explosive safety
      requirements are not specified in a contract, apply the provisions of DoD 4145.26-M.
      1.2.1.4. To US-titled AE in host nation facilities. When operating overseas, remain
      cognizant of host nation laws and applicable international agreements. Ensure host
      nation officials receive appropriate notification of explosives-related activities in
      accordance with applicable legal requirements. When DoD AE are located in overseas
      areas, comply with US ammunition and explosives safety standards except when
      compliance with more restrictive local standards is made mandatory by an appropriate
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 29


     international agreement. When such ammunition is not in US custody and under US
     control, comply with US standards to the extent consistent with agreements or
     arrangements with the host country concerned. If Air Force civilian or military personnel
     occupy leased bases within North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, also
     apply the safety distances in Allied Ammunition Storage and Transport Publication
     (AASTP) - 1, Document AC/258-D/455, Manual of NATO Safety Principles for the
     Storage of Military Ammunition and Explosives to exposures outside the base boundary
     and NATO criteria to host nation exposed sites (ES) within the base.
     1.2.1.5. To Air Force personnel and facilities exposed by any other potential explosion
     site (PES), whether it be DoD, host nation, or commercial AE. US personnel and US-
     titled munitions must be accorded the quantity-distance (QD) separation standards
     required by the Air Force and by DoD, even at foreign locations. US units will document
     their adherence to these standards by showing that US ESs are located at the required
     separation distances from host nation PESs. US ESs will be sited according to Chapter
     14, and host nation PESs identified on explosives site plans. The identification of host
     nation PESs does not constitute ―siting‖ because the US does not authorize AE for host
     nation facilities not under US control. If a violation of Air Force or DoD QD criteria to
     US targets is possible based on this analysis, obtain a waiver or exemption as outlined in
     Section 1B. If correction of the problem is beyond US capabilities, notify the host nation
     commander by letter from the waiver or exemption approval level. Attach to this letter
     enough information to convey the location, nature and extent of the potential explosives
     hazards. While other countries are not obligated to follow US rules, it may be helpful to
     explain to host nations that US QD standards are enforced on US installations, and are
     based on testing, experience, and scientific analysis.
     1.2.1.6. To the following, unless otherwise stated in this Manual:
        1.2.1.6.1. Day-to-day Operations. Operations a unit conducts on a day-to-day
        basis, including exercises, training and evaluations.
        1.2.1.6.2. Contingency or War Plans. Operations that a unit plans to conduct only
        during a contingency or combat scenario (see Chapter 13). These operations are
        defined by operational plans, and are only projections based on possible or likely
        scenarios. They include planned operations at collocated operating bases (COB).
        1.2.1.6.3. Contingencies, Combat Operations, Military Operations Other Than
        War (MOOTW), and Associated Training. Operations that a unit actually
        conducts during or leading up to a contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation.
        These operations may actually occur as previously defined by the operational plan,
        may be modified from the operational plan, or may be newly defined if an operational
        plan did not exist prior to the contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation. Associated
        training immediately supports an impending or on-going contingency, combat, or
        MOOTW situation. Routine training falls under day-to-day operations per paragraph
        1.2.1.6.1.
     1.2.1.7. To Air Force contract personnel (except as allowed in paragraph 1.2.1.3)
     exposed to AE on Air Force installations. Such personnel may be afforded the same level
     of protection that would be similarly provided to Air Force civilian and military
 30                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      personnel. The installation weapons safety office will notify the contracting officer, in
      writing, of explosives hazards to Air Force contract personnel.
      1.2.1.8. To the siting and construction of Air Force facilities (except as allowed in
      paragraph 1.2.2).
   1.2.2. Continue to use existing facilities which do not comply with these standards only
   when current hazards are not greater than those assumed for their original use, and only
   provided installations can clearly demonstrate that redesign or modification is not feasible,
   and that the quantity of explosives, propellants, or chemical agents cannot be reduced for
   reasons of operational necessity.
      1.2.2.1. To invoke this grandfathering clause for continued use of such facilities, have
      the following on file at the installation:
          1.2.2.1.1. Date of construction, original purpose and quantity of explosives approved.
          1.2.2.1.2. Explosives safety criteria in effect at the time of construction.
          1.2.2.1.3. An explanation why redesign or modification is not feasible.
          1.2.2.1.4. An explanation why quantities cannot be reduced below existing levels.
          1.2.2.1.5. An explanation why current explosives safety criteria cannot be applied to
          the facility.
          1.2.2.1.6. A statement that risks are not greater than those assumed for the original
          siting.
          1.2.2.1.7. Written approval from the installation commander and the major
          command’s Chief of Safety (MAJCOM/SE) when initially invoking grandfather
          clause.
      1.2.2.2. The installation Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) will review the information
      required in paragraph 1.2.2.1 at least every five years to see if mission changes will allow
      the facility to be brought into compliance with current standards. If compliance with
      current standards is not possible and the facility is still being used for its original purpose
      and in accordance with its original criteria, then continue to maintain the documentation
      that was generated at the onset. Documentation of the periodic review must be kept on
      file at the installation.
      1.2.2.3. Resiting such facilities requires compliance with these standards unless guidance
      of paragraph 1.2.2. is met or an exception is obtained in accordance with Section 1B.
   1.2.3. Evaluate non-DoD explosives siting submissions on DoD installations only to ensure
   compliance with DoD explosives safety standards to non-commercial (DoD and public)
   exposures (see paragraph 12.88).
   1.2.4. Site plans approved by MAJCOM prior to 31 December 1999 are no longer valid and
   must be submitted for Air Force and DoD approval.

Section 1B—Exception Program

1.3. General.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     31


   1.3.1. The AE safety standards herein are designed to manage the risks associated with AE
   by providing protection against serious injury, loss of life, and damage to property but are not
   intended to be so rigid as to prevent the Air Force from accomplishing its assigned missions.
   Consequently, when exceptions from these standards are made, proper authority within the
   Air Force must accept the added risk to personnel and property against the strategic or other
   compelling reasons that necessitate such exceptions. Added risk to personnel and property
   must be analyzed and documented to include methods used to reduce the risk to a level
   acceptable to the Air Force approval authority.
   1.3.2. Ease of operation or convenience are not reasons for requesting an exception.
   1.3.3. This section implements AFI 90-901, Risk Management, by providing a mechanism
   for units to assess the level of risk involved with QD exceptions and by providing guidance
   on the appropriate approval level for each exception. Make this determination after a
   complete analysis of the mission, explosives requirements, and facilities.
   1.3.4. Out of Continental United States (OCONUS) Locations.
       1.3.4.1. Host nation military and civilian personnel must be provided the same level of
       protection as US personnel. Host nation commanders must be notified when QD
       exceptions to Air Force standards place host nation personnel at additional risk. Also,
       where international treaties or Status of Forces Agreements require it, host nation
       approval must be obtained.
       1.3.4.2. See paragraph 1.2.1.5 for additional guidance, when explosives content of host
       nations facilities may be hazarding Air Force facilities and personnel.
   1.3.5. Exceptions need not be submitted when compensatory measures can be taken (e.g.,
   temporarily reducing the authorized net explosive weight for quantity-distance (NEWQD) of
   a PES) that will avoid an exception. Document as prescribed in paragraphs 14.22.8 and
   14.23.12.
   1.3.6. Exceptions need not be submitted for situations that, upon analysis by Headquarters
   Air Force Safety Center/Weapons Safety Division (AFSC/SEW) and the DoD Explosives
   Safety Board (DDESB), are determined to provide the required degree of safety through use
   of protective construction or other specialized safety features.
   1.3.7. MAJCOM/Weapons Safety (SEW) and the host base weapons safety offices must
   maintain copies of current waivers, exemptions, deviations, and compensatory measures for
   day-to-day operations as well as contingency and war plans.
   1.3.8. Day-to-day operations involving exceptions must not be allowed until the exceptions
   are approved by the required approval authority (see paragraph 13.10 for direction
   concerning contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, and associated training).
   1.3.9. Exception is the inclusive term for any departure from the requirements of this
   Manual. Exceptions are further divided into deviations, operational waivers, waivers,
   exemptions, and Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) waivers and exemptions for new
   construction.
1.4. Deviations. A deviation is a written authority permitting exceptions from mandatory non-
QD requirements of this Manual for strategic or other compelling reasons. Generally, Chapters
12 and 13 of this Manual contain QD requirements and all other chapters contain non-QD
 32                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


requirements. This paragraph applies to deviations for day-to-day operations as well as
contingency and war plans. Deviations for contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, and
associated training will be in accordance with paragraph 13.10.
   1.4.1. Deviations from paragraph 5.23.4 ―Sideflash Protection for Nuclear Weapons‖ or
   paragraph 9.30 ―MME Safety Procedures/Considerations,‖ and any/all of their
   subparagraphs, must be formally approved by AFSC/SEW.
      1.4.1.1. Deviation requests shall be documented as required in paragraph 1.4.3 below,
      with the following changes:
          1.4.1.1.1. For deviations from paragraph 5.23.4, there is an additional requirement
          for a detailed description of compensatory measures which have been developed and
          are in place. The description shall include the reduced value of side flash separation
          distance which will be observed.
          1.4.1.1.2. For deviations from paragraph 5.23.4, modify the requirement for a risk
          assessment (paragraph 1.4.3.3) to include only a review of the trade-offs between any
          expected additional risk from the decreased side flash separation distance and any
          expected increased safety due to the compensatory measures. The requirements
          necessary to complete this assessment shall be developed in coordination with
          AFSC/SEW on a case-by-case basis.
          1.4.1.1.3. For deviations from paragraph 9.31, modify the requirement for a risk
          assessment (paragraph 1.4.3.3) to include only a detailed technical evaluation of the
          electromagnetic hazards and electro-explosive device (EED) sensitivities involved,
          and a description of the operational need for the deviation.
          1.4.1.1.4. For deviations from either paragraph, there is an additional requirement for
          a signed statement with the authority to accept any increased risk and acknowledge
          responsibility for any consequences resulting from performing operations under this
          deviation.
      1.4.1.2. AFSC/SEW will forward copies of all approved deviations to MAJCOM/SEW.
      1.4.1.3. MAJCOMs determine the criteria to identify, track and review base level
      deviations.
   1.4.2. MAJCOMs determine approval levels for all other deviations for day-to-day
   operations and contingency or war plans. MAJCOMs will document required approval
   levels.
   1.4.3. Deviations shall be documented using a memorandum format, and shall include the
   following information:
      1.4.3.1. Requirement of this Manual (cite specific reference) that is being excepted.
      1.4.3.2. Strategic or other compelling reasons for requesting the deviation.
      1.4.3.3. Risk assessment in accordance with Chapter 4.
      1.4.3.4. Evaluation of feasible corrective actions and justification why none can currently
      be implemented (e.g. cost, mission impact).
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     33


       1.4.3.5. Corrective action or actions which will be pursued to ultimately correct the
       deviation. Several corrective actions, any one of which may correct the deviation, may
       be pursued at the same time. For each corrective action being pursued provide associated
       cost estimate and schedule for completion.
       1.4.3.6. If no corrective actions are feasible to ultimately correct the deviation, so state
       and provide justification.
       1.4.3.7. Expiration date, if appropriate.
   1.4.4. Deviations will be reviewed every three years. See paragraph 1.13 for review process
   requirements.
1.5. Operational Waivers. An operational waiver is written authority permitting a temporary
exception from mandatory requirements of this Manual for strategic or other compelling reasons
when conditions or circumstances causing the waiver arise unexpectedly and there is not enough
time to comply with the formal waiver submission procedures. Additionally, an operational
waiver may be implemented when initiation of explosives operations or events are required for
strategic or other compelling reasons prior to receipt of final DDESB approval according to
paragraph 14.15.1.1.       This paragraph applies to operational waivers for day-to-day
operations. Operational waivers for OCONUS contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, and
associated training will be in accordance with paragraph 13.10.
   1.5.1. If the operational waiver cannot be corrected within 180 days, submit a formal waiver
   or exemption.
   1.5.2. Operational waivers must not be used as a replacement for proper planning when
   formal explosives site planning approval can be obtained prior to the start of operations.
   1.5.3. The responsible commander must approve the operational waiver in writing prior to
   onset of operations, or as soon as possible thereafter, for the length of the operational
   requirement but not to exceed 180 days. If the Air Force unit is a tenant on a non-United
   States Air Force installation, process according to governing directives.
   1.5.4. Operational waivers shall be documented using a memorandum format and shall
   include, as applicable, the following information:
       1.5.4.1. Type and NEWQD of munitions involved.
       1.5.4.2. Type of ES. If people are present, give an estimate of the number of civilians
       and military.
       1.5.4.3. Strategic or other compelling reasons for approving the exception.
       1.5.4.4. Distance required versus distance available and QD standard not met.
       1.5.4.5. Narrative explanation outlining the reason or reasons why the explosive
       standards could not be met and a discussion of reasonable alternatives considered and
       rejected.
       1.5.4.6. Risk assessment in accordance with Chapter 4.
       1.5.4.7. Waiver or exemption decision nomograph for each excepted PES to ES pair (see
       paragraph 1.12).
 34                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       1.5.4.8. Expected duration of the operational waiver.
       1.5.4.9. Point of Contact (POC) name, grade, phone, and e-mail.
   1.5.5. Units will submit a copy of the approved operational waiver to MAJCOM/SEW.
   MAJCOM/SEW will then forward to AFSC/SEW, which may be included as part of the
   formal explosives site planning submission process.
1.6. Waivers. A waiver is a written authority permitting a temporary exception, for existing
construction, from a mandatory QD requirement of this Manual for strategic or other compelling
reasons. Generally, waivers are granted for a short period (5 years or less) pending cancellation
or correction of the waived conditions. Waivers will not be granted for periods exceeding 5
years. This paragraph applies to waivers for day-to-day operations as well as contingency and
war plans. Waivers for contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, and associated training will
be in accordance with paragraph 13.10.
   1.6.1. Waiver approval level for day-to-day operations as well as contingency and war plans
   will be based on the level of risk assumed by the specific hazard. The approval level is
   determined by application of the nomograph per paragraph 1.12.
   1.6.2. Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.10 (paragraph 1.11
   for HAF-level waivers).
   1.6.3. Forward waivers for day-to-day operations, contingency plans and war plans as part of
   the explosives site plan package. Submit through command channels to AFSC/SEW. Each
   level of review will scrutinize the package for validity. Return packages failing to meet the
   test of strategic or other compelling need, or packages omitting information requirements
   listed in paragraph 1.10 (or paragraph 1.11 for HAF-level waivers).
   1.6.4. Waivers will be reviewed annually on the anniversary of their approval date. See
   paragraph 1.13 for review process requirements.
1.7. Exemptions. An exemption is a written authority permitting a long-term (more than 5
years) exception, for existing construction, from a mandatory QD requirement of this Manual for
strategic or other compelling reasons. This paragraph applies to exemptions for day-to-day
operations, contingency plans and war plans. Exemptions for contingencies, combat operations,
MOOTW, associated training will be in accordance with paragraph 13.10.
   1.7.1. Exemption approval level for day-to-day operations, contingency plans and war plans
   will be based on the level of risk assumed by the specific hazard. The approval level is
   determined by application of the nomograph per paragraph 1.12.
   1.7.2. Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.10 (paragraph 1.11
   for HAF-level exemptions).
   1.7.3. Forward exemptions for day-to-day operations, contingency plans and war plans as
   part of the explosives site plan package. Submit through command channels to AFSC/SEW.
   Each level of review will scrutinize the package for validity. Return packages failing to meet
   the test of strategic or other compelling need, or packages omitting information requirements
   listed in paragraph 1.10 (or paragraph 1.11 for HAF-level exemptions).
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   35


   1.7.4. Exemptions will be reviewed every 5 years on the anniversary of the approval date.
   Reviews may be accomplished early to spread out workloads. See paragraph 1.13 for review
   process requirements.
1.8. SECAF Waivers and Exemptions for New Construction. SECAF waivers and
exemptions are written authorities that permit an exception, for new PES or ES construction,
from a mandatory QD requirement of this Manual for strategic or other compelling reasons. This
paragraph applies to SECAF waivers and exemptions for new construction in support of day-to-
day operations, contingency plans and war plans. Waivers and exemptions for new construction
in support of contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, associated training will be in
accordance with paragraph 13.10.
   1.8.1. All planned construction in support of day-to-day operations as well as contingency
   and war plans which do not meet QD standards must be approved by SECAF.
   1.8.2. An action which places an existing facility constructed within the past three years at
   less than prescribed QD requires SECAF approval. AF/SE may deviate from this
   requirement on a case-by-case basis.
   1.8.3. Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.11.
   1.8.4. Forward SECAF waivers and exemptions for day-to-day operations, contingency
   plans and war plans as part of the explosives site plan package. Submit through command
   channels to AFSC/SEW. Each level of review will scrutinize the package for validity.
   Return packages failing to meet the test of strategic or other compelling need, or packages
   omitting information requirements listed in paragraph 1.11.
   1.8.5. See paragraph 1.13 for review process requirements.
   1.8.6. Temporary QD departures to workers performing construction will be assessed and
   approved in accordance with paragraph 1.12.
1.9. Exceptions for Non-DoD Explosives Activities on Air Force Installations. Non-DoD
explosives activities that are non-compliant with the explosives safety standards in this Manual,
but which do not hazard DoD activities or violate QD criteria to DoD activities, will not be
processed as exceptions. Instead, explosives site plan packages involving such non-compliant,
non-DoD explosives activities will:
   1.9.1. Clearly specify situations where non-compliance with explosives safety requirements
   exists.
   1.9.2. Include a risk acknowledgement letter signed by the non-DoD user.
   1.9.3. Include installation’s weapons safety office recommendation for explosives site plan
   approval or disapproval with supporting rationale and installation commander coordination.
   1.9.4. Coordinate with the non-DoD user prior to higher headquarters submission of the
   explosives site plan.
1.10. Waiver and Exemption Information Requirements. Preparation of waivers and
exemptions is a team effort involving installation safety, civil engineering, legal, and other
agencies affected by the waiver or exemption. Involve all supporting and affected agencies to
ensure thorough evaluation of the proposed waiver or exemption.
 36                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   1.10.1. Identify waivers and exemptions for each individual PES to ES relationship not
   meeting the QD requirements of this Manual.
   1.10.2. For each excepted PES to ES pair, submit the following information in the
   explosives site plan package (Attachment 3 contains a sample narrative of a Q-D exception
   request):
       1.10.2.1. Waiver or exemption number.
       1.10.2.2. Requirement from this Manual (cite specific reference) that is being excepted.
       1.10.2.3. Strategic or other compelling reasons for requesting the waiver or exemption.
       1.10.2.4. Risk assessment in accordance with Chapter 4.
       1.10.2.5. Waiver or exemption decision nomograph (see paragraph 1.12).
       1.10.2.6. Evaluation of feasible corrective actions and justification why none can
       currently be implemented (e.g. cost, mission impact).
       1.10.2.7. Corrective action or actions which will be pursued to ultimately correct the
       waiver or exemption. Several corrective actions, any one of which may correct the
       waiver or exemption, may be pursued at the same time. For each corrective action being
       pursued provide associated cost estimate and schedule for completion. (Installation
       safety staff will keep copies of supporting documentation for corrective actions being
       pursued.)
       1.10.2.8. If no corrective actions are feasible to ultimately correct the waiver or
       exemption, so state and provide justification.
       1.10.2.9. Expiration date, if appropriate.
   1.10.3. See paragraph 14.23.10 for identifying waivers and exemptions on the AF Form 943,
   Explosives Site Plan.
   1.10.4. If the waiver or exemption decision nomograph (paragraph 1.12) requires Assistant
   Secretary of the Air Force, SAF/Installations, Environment and Logistics (SAF/IE) approval,
   comply with the information requirements in paragraph 1.11.
1.11. HAF-Level Waiver and Exemption Information Requirements. This paragraph
applies to all waivers and exemptions requiring SECAF or SAF/IE approval. To expedite
processing of explosives site plans (ESP) with waivers or exemptions through Air Staff and
Secretariat offices, a standardized format is essential. Units or MAJCOMs seeking HAF-level
approval for waivers and exemptions will submit all required information electronically. Provide
all ESP information required in Chapter 14, even though it may not all be included in the
package forwarded to HAF-level. Assemble HAF-level request packages using the following
format:
   1.11.1. Tab 1. MAJCOM/CC or CV Memorandum. Use the transmittal letter in
   Attachment 2 as a format for this memorandum.
   1.11.2. Tab 2. Maps. Provide the map for the explosives site plan according to paragraph
   14.24. Additionally, submit a map which clearly shows the specific waivers and exemptions
   requiring HAF-level approval. Use separate colors to differentiate between HAF-level
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     37


   waivers and exemptions and those approved at subordinate levels of command. Where
   existing explosive clear zones are changing, show both the old and new.
   1.11.3. Tab 3. AF Form 943. Clearly show which siting pairs are without exceptions,
   which exceptions require HAF-level approval, and which have received approval at
   subordinate levels of command. See paragraph 14.23 for specific guidance and Figure 14.3
   as an example.
   1.11.4. Tab 4. The Specific Standard Not Met. Identify and cite the specific reference in
   this Manual requiring the exemption or waiver. Provide sufficient information to explain the
   nature of the exemption or waiver. Use highlighted excerpts from this Manual to explain the
   type of separation required (e.g., inhabited building or public traffic route distances) and the
   distance required or how the distance is calculated (e.g., QD distance criteria table, fragment
   distance criteria, etc.).
   1.11.5. Tab 5. Justification. In narrative form, provide a detailed explanation of the
   ―strategic or other compelling‖ reason for requesting the HAF-level waiver or exemption.
   Use specific references to aircraft sortie rates or other pertinent data to justify the type,
   quantity, and placement of explosives at the PES. Additionally, fully justify the position of
   the excepted ES. Provide any additional information, such as higher headquarters inspection
   findings or limiting factors (LIMFAC) which substantiate the request. Identify all feasible
   corrective actions and justify why none can currently be implemented (e.g. cost, mission
   impact).
   1.11.6. Tab 6. Risk Assessment. Provide a risk assessment in accordance with Chapter 4.
   Provide a separate waiver or exemption decision nomograph (paragraph 1.12) for each
   excepted PES to ES pair requiring HAF-level approval.
   1.11.7. Tab 7. Corrective Actions. Discuss any and all actions taken or planned to mitigate
   the effects of an explosives mishap. Consider such things as building techniques,
   barricading, glass protection, tiered siting, or planned construction. Identify the specific
   corrective action or actions which will be pursued to ultimately correct the waiver or
   exemption. Several corrective actions, any one of which may correct the waiver or
   exemption, may be pursued at the same time. For each corrective action being pursued
   provide associated cost estimate and schedule for completion. (Installation safety staff will
   keep copies of supporting documentation for corrective actions being pursued.) If no
   corrective actions are feasible to ultimately correct the waiver or exemption, so state and
   provide justification.
   1.11.8. Tab 8. Options. Discuss fully all reasonable options considered by the unit but
   rejected in favor of the proposed action. Give details as to why each of the other options was
   not chosen. Discuss limitations to funding, real estate, or other constraints, as appropriate.
1.12. Waiver or Exemption Decision Nomograph. The waiver or exemption decision
nomograph is a tool to assess risk, and determine the appropriate authority level for acceptance
of that risk, for exceptions from mandatory QD requirements of this Manual.
   1.12.1. Use the applicable nomograph based on the following situations:
       1.12.1.1. For exceptions in day-to-day operations use Figure 1.1.
 38                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      1.12.1.2. For exceptions in contingency and war plans use Figure 1.2. For combined
      day-to-day operations, and contingency and war plan ESPs, use Figure 1.1 for exceptions.
      However, if tiered siting is used, Figure 1.2 may be used for exceptions associated solely
      with the war plan operations tier.
      1.12.1.3. Exceptions for contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, and associated
      training are addressed in paragraph 13.10. Operations authorized by Homeland Defense
      directives will use Figure 1.1 within the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska,
      Hawaii, U.S. possessions or territories.
   1.12.2. Risk-based approval levels range from SAF/IE down to Numbered Air Force
   (NAF) commander level. As specified in Figure 1.1, NAF commanders may delegate
   approval authority for the lowest levels of risk to wing commander or equivalent. This
   delegation must be in writing. Where NAFs do not exist, MAJCOMs will identify an
   alternate intermediate command level between wing and MAJCOM; if there is no
   intermediate command level, MAJCOM approval will be required in place of NAF.
   1.12.3. Override Authority. USAF/SE may elevate any QD exception for day-to-day
   operations, contingency plans or war plans to the Air Force Chief of Staff for final approval
   or for information purposes.
   1.12.4. The nomograph is a two-step process. First, conduct a risk assessment to categorize
   the level of risk. Then plot the criteria on the nomograph and determine the approval level.
      1.12.4.1. Risk Assessment. Risk levels are calculated based on three criteria:
          1.12.4.1.1. Likelihood. The likelihood of a mishap is the relative probability an
          explosives mishap will occur based on the type of explosives involved, the level of
          activity at the PES, and external threats to the location. Each excepted PES will be
              categorized according to one of the five likelihood levels identified in Table
          1.1. Contact AFSC/SEW when Table 1.1 fails to describe explosive operations or
          locations adequately.
          1.12.4.1.2. Exposure. Exposure is the amount of time personnel and resources at an
          ES are exposed to a PES. It is expressed as man-hours per year. Use Table 1.2 to
          categorize each excepted ES.
          1.12.4.1.3. Consequences. The possible consequences of an explosives mishap are
          based on the worst-case type and amount of explosives present, the construction of
          both the PES and ES, and the distance between the PES and ES. Use information in
          Chapter 4 to estimate the potential damage and injuries from a mishap
          explosion. Consequences will be categorized based on their effect on personnel,
          mission capability, and other resources according to Table 1.3.
      1.12.4.2. Plotting the Nomograph. Each exception pair will have three data points as
      defined in paragraph 1.12.4.1. Plot each data point on the applicable nomograph. Draw a
      straight line from the Likelihood point, through the Exposure point, to the Pivot
      Line. From this point on the Pivot Line, draw a straight line through the Possible
      Consequences point, to the Approval Level line. Figure 1.3 is an example of a
      nomograph plot.
1.13. Periodic Reviews for Exceptions.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   39


   1.13.1. Periodic reviews of exceptions shall be documented, and include the following:
      1.13.1.1. Confirmation of the continued existence of the exception.
      1.13.1.2. Verification of the accuracy of the previous data associated with the exception.
      1.13.1.3. Validation of the strategic or other compelling reasons for initial approval of
      the exception.
      1.13.1.4. Validation that mitigating actions and stipulations are still in force.
      1.13.1.5. Reassessment of proposed corrective actions. Identify any changes to proposed
      corrective actions and the reasons for those changes.
      1.13.1.6. Current cost estimates for proposed corrective actions.
      1.13.1.7. Status of progress towards accomplishing corrective actions and eliminating the
      exception.
      1.13.1.8. Estimated date and schedule for completion of corrective actions.
   1.13.2. Submit copies of periodic review documentation through command channels to
   AFSC/SEW.
   1.13.3. Use the periodic review documentation to advocate funding, and other support
   required, for corrective action implementation.
   1.13.4. Approval Levels for Reviews.
      1.13.4.1. Reviews of deviations from paragraph 5.23.4 ―Side Flash Protection for
      Nuclear Weapons‖ or paragraph 9.30 ―MME Safety Procedures and Considerations,‖ and
      any or all of its subparagraphs, must be formally approved by AFSC/SEW.
      1.13.4.2. MAJCOMs determine approval levels for periodic review of all other
      deviations. MAJCOMs will document required review approval levels.
      1.13.4.3. For non-HAF-level waivers or exemptions approved prior to the
      waiver/exemption decision nomograph (paragraph 1.12) methodology, use the
      nomograph to determine the approval level.
      1.13.4.4. For non-HAF-level waivers/exemptions approved using the waiver or
      exemption decision nomograph, the waiver or exemption will be reviewed at the original
      approval level. However, if PES to ES data has changed, reapply the nomograph to
      determine the approval level.
      1.13.4.5. For waivers where the required time for completion of corrective actions to
      eliminate the waiver has exceeded 5 years, the waiver shall be reissued by the next higher
      approval level (unless the waiver was last approved at SAF/IE).
      1.13.4.6. For HAF-level waivers and exemptions, see Table 1.4 to determine review
      approval level.
1.14. Cancellation of Waivers and Exemptions. Units will notify MAJCOM’s who will in
turn notify AFSC/SEW of waivers and exceptions no longer needed according to procedures
outlined in MAJCOM supplements.

                                           Chapter 2

                                   REACTION EFFECTS

Section 2A—Principal Effects of High Density (HD) 1.1 Events

2.1. Blast.
   2.1.1. Blast Wave Phenomena. In an incident involving HD 1.1, or HD 1.1 with any other
   HD (a HD 1.1 event), the violent release of energy creates a sudden and intense pressure
   disturbance termed the ―blast wave.‖ The blast wave is characterized by an almost
   instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure
   increase, or ―shock front,‖ travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a
   diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas
   molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the
   ―particle velocity,‖ is associated with the ―dynamic pressure,‖ or the pressure formed by the
   winds produced by the shock front.
       2.1.1.1. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the
       incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increases.
       2.1.1.2. If the shock wave impinges a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the
       direction of the wave’s propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the
       surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This
       reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave’s pressure and the angle formed
       between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front.
   2.1.2. Partially Confined Explosions. When an explosion occurs within a structure, the
   peak pressure associated with the initial shock front will both be high and amplified by
   reflections within the structure. In addition, the accumulation of gases from the explosion
   will exert additional pressure and increase the load duration within the structure. This effect
   may damage or destroy the structure unless the structure is designed to either withstand or
   vent the gas and shock pressures. Structures that have one or more strengthened walls may
   be vented for relief of excessive gas by either frangible construction of the remaining walls
   or roof or through the use of openings. This type of construction will permit the gas from an
   internal explosion to spill out of the structure. Once released from confinement, these
   pressures (referred to as ―exterior‖ or ―leakage‖ pressures) expand radially and may affect
   external structures or personnel.
   2.1.3. QD K-factors. Throughout this Manual, NEWQD is used to calculate QD
   separations for blast protection by means of a formula using a ―K-factor.‖ See paragraph
   12.11. for explanation of this formula.
   2.1.4. Expected Blast Pressures at QD Table 2.1 presents the incident pressures that would
   be expected at various K-factors from HD 1.1 events. Use of the Incident Airblast Calculator
   and the Blast Effects Calculator (BEC) may also be used.
   2.1.5. General Blast Effects On Structures.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    47


     2.1.5.1. Conventional Structures. Conventional structures are generally designed to
     withstand roof-snow loads of 0-50 pounds per square foot or wind loads up to 90 miles
     per hour, or both. At 90 mph, the wind load equates to 0.14 psi. Given the pressures
     shown in Table 2.1 for the selected K-factors, it is evident that, even at inhabited building
     distance (IBD), conventional structures may not provide complete protection from blast.
     Generally, the weakest portions of any conventional structure are the windows. Table 2.2
     provides the probability of breaking typical windows at various K-factors and associated
     incident pressures from HD 1.1 events.
     2.1.5.2. Above Ground Structures (AGS). These are generally considered
     conventional structures and provide little protection from blast or fragmentation. (See
     paragraph 2.5.)
     2.1.5.3. Earth-Covered Magazine (ECM). An explosion at an ECM produces high
     reflected pressure and impulse. These can damage doors and headwalls of adjacent
     ECMs, propelling debris onto contents and communicating the explosion. When
     separated from each other by the minimum distances required by Table 12.1, ECMs (see
     Section 6C) provide AE with virtually complete protection against
     propagation. However, AE in adjacent ECMs may be damaged and structural damage
     ranging from cracks in concrete, damage to ventilators and doors to complete structural
     failure may occur in the corresponding ECM. (NOTE:When ECMs containing HD 1.1
     AE are sited so that if any one is in the forward sector of another, the two must be
     separated by distances greater than the minimum permitted for side-to-side
     orientations. The greater distances are required to protect the door and headwall of a
     facing ECM from the adjacent explosion; to a lesser extent, they are required as
     protection from the directional effects of the source.)
     2.1.5.4. Underground Storage Facilities. Underground facilities sited per DoD
     6055.09-M, Volume 5, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards provide a high
     degree of protection against propagation of an explosion between chambers, and between
     underground and aboveground structures. An HD 1.1 explosion in an underground
     storage facility causes very high pressures of prolonged duration. Blast waves and the
     accompanying gas flows will travel throughout the underground facility at high velocity.
     2.1.5.5. Barricaded Open-Storage Modules. Barricaded open-storage modules (see
     Section 6D) provide a high degree of protection against the propagation of an
     explosion. However, if flammable materials are present in nearby cells, subsequent
     propagation by fire is possible. When an explosion occurs in adjacent modules separated
     by K1.1, AE will be thrown tens of meters and be covered with earth, thereby unavailable
     for use until extensive uncovering operations, and possibly maintenance, are
     completed. Items at K=2.5 separation distance from a donor explosion are expected to be
     readily accessible.
  2.1.6. General Blast Effects on Personnel. Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 describe the expected
  effects of blast on personnel.
  2.1.7. Computation of Blast Effects. Many of the blast effects described in this section
  were computed using the DDESB Blast Effects Computer (available at
  http://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil) and proven test methodologies as outlined in Department
  of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) Technical Paper (TP) 16, Current revision,
 48                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   Methodologies for Calculating Primary Fragment Characteristics. The DDESB Blast
   Effects Computer can be used to estimate similar effects associated with various NEWQDs,
   facilities, and distances.
2.2. Fragments. General. An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated
with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Although most common in HD 1.1 or
HD 1.2 (see Section 2B) events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving
AE. Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as ―primary‖ or ―secondary‖
fragments.
   2.2.1. Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles,
   hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives, rocket engine housings)
   in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at
   thousands of feet per second and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion.
   2.2.2. Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to
   the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments
   and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary
   fragments.
   2.2.3. The earth cover of an underground facility may rupture and create a significant debris
   hazard.
   2.2.4. A hazardous fragment is one having an impact energy of 58 ft-lb or greater.
   2.2.5. A hazardous fragment density is 1 hazardous fragment per 600 ft2.
2.3. Thermal Hazards.
   2.3.1. General. Generally, thermal hazards from a HD 1.1 event are less hazardous than
   blast and fragment hazards.
   2.3.2. Personnel. It normally takes longer to incur injury from thermal effects than from
   either blast or fragmentation effects because both blast and fragmentation occur almost
   instantaneously. The time available to react to a thermal event increases survivability.
   2.3.3. Structures, Material, and AE. The primary thermal effect on structures, material,
   and AE is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern with a fire involving
   AE is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, such as a detonation.
2.4. Groundshock and Cratering.
   2.4.1. General.
       2.4.1.1. In an airburst, there may be a downward propagation of ground shock. Cratering
       may be reduced or eliminated.
   2.4.1.2.   In a surface burst, ground shock is generated and cratering can be significant.
       2.4.1.3. A buried or partially buried detonation produces the strongest ground shock;
       however, if the explosion is deep enough, no crater will be formed.
   2.4.2. Underground Facilities. AE protection can be achieved by proper chamber spacing.
   An HD 1.1 explosion will produce ground shocks that may rupture the earth cover and eject
   debris. (See DoD 6055.09-M.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    49


2.5. Expected Consequences.
   2.5.1. Barricaded Aboveground Magazine Distance – K6 (27 psi). At this distance:
      2.5.1.1. Unstrengthened buildings will be destroyed.
      2.5.1.2. Personnel will be killed by blast, by being struck by debris, or by impact against
      hard surfaces.
      2.5.1.3. Transport vehicles will be overturned and crushed by the blast.
      2.5.1.4. Explosives-loaded vessels will be damaged severely, with propagation of
      explosion likely.
      2.5.1.5. Aircraft will be destroyed by blast, thermal, and debris effects.
      2.5.1.6. Barricades are an effective control measure for preventing immediate
      propagation of explosion by high velocity low angle fragments. However, they provide
      only limited protection against any delayed propagation of explosives caused by a fire
      resulting from high angle firebrands.
   2.5.2. Barricaded Intraline Distance – K9 (12 psi). At this distance:
      2.5.2.1. Unstrengthened buildings will suffer severe structural damage approaching total
      destruction.
      2.5.2.2. Personnel will be subject to severe injuries or death from direct blast, building
      collapse, or translation.
      2.5.2.3. Aircraft will be damaged beyond economical repair both by blast and fragments.
      (If the aircraft are loaded with explosives, delayed explosions are likely to result from
      subsequent fires.)
      2.5.2.4. Transport vehicles will be damaged heavily, probably to the extent of total loss.
      2.5.2.5. Improperly designed barricades or structures may increase the hazard from
      flying debris, or may collapse in such a manner as to increase the risk to personnel and
      equipment.
      2.5.2.6. Barricading is a required control measure. Direct propagation of explosion
      between two explosive locations is unlikely when barricades are placed between them to
      intercept high velocity low angle fragments. Exposed structures containing high value,
      mission critical equipment or personnel may require hardening.
   2.5.3. Unbarricaded Aboveground Magazine Distance – K11 (8 psi). At this distance:
      2.5.3.1. Unstrengthened buildings will suffer damage approaching total destruction.
      2.5.3.2. Personnel are likely to be injured seriously due to blast, fragments, debris, and
      translation.
      2.5.3.3. There is a 15 percent risk of eardrum rupture.
      2.5.3.4. Explosives-loaded vessels are likely to be damaged extensively and delayed
      propagation of explosion may occur.
      2.5.3.5. Aircraft will be damaged heavily by blast and fragments; destruction by
      resulting fire is likely.
50                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


     2.5.3.6. Transport vehicles will sustain severe body damage, minor engine damage, and
     total glass breakage.
     2.5.3.7. As a control, barricading will significantly reduce the risk of propagation of
     explosion and injury of personnel by high velocity low angle fragments.
  2.5.4. Unbarricaded Intraline Distance – K18 (3.5 psi). At this distance:
     2.5.4.1. Direct propagation of explosion is not expected.
     2.5.4.2. Delayed propagation of an explosion may occur at the ES, as either a direct
     result of a fire or as a result of equipment failure.
     2.5.4.3. Damage to unstrengthened buildings may approximate 50 percent, or more, of
     the total replacement cost. Sensitive electronic equipment is expected to stop
     functioning.
     2.5.4.4. There is a two percent chance of eardrum damage to personnel.
     2.5.4.5. Personnel may suffer serious injuries from fragments, debris, firebrands, or other
     objects.
     2.5.4.6. Fragments could damage the decks and superstructure of cargo ships and
     overpressure could buckle their doors and bulkheads on weather decks.
     2.5.4.7. Aircraft can be expected to suffer considerable structural damage from blast.
     Fragments and debris are likely to cause severe damage to aircraft at K18 distances when
     small quantities of explosives are involved.
     2.5.4.8. Transport vehicles will incur extensive, but not severe, body and glass damage
     consisting mainly of dishing of body panels and cracks in shatter-resistant window glass.
     2.5.4.9. Suitably designed suppressive construction at PES or protective construction at
     ES may be practical controls for some situations. Such construction is encouraged when
     there is insufficient distance to provide the required protection.
  2.5.5. Public Traffic Route Distance (PTRD) (under 100,000 lbs HE) – K24 (2.3 psi). At
  this distance:
     2.5.5.1. Unstrengthened buildings can be expected to sustain damage approximately 20
     percent of the replacement cost.
     2.5.5.2. Occupants of exposed structures may suffer temporary hearing loss or injury
     from blast effects, building debris and displacement.
     2.5.5.3. Although personnel in the open are not expected to be killed or seriously injured
     by blast effects, fragments and debris may cause some injuries. The extent of these
     injuries depends largely upon the PES structure and the amount and fragmentation
     characteristics of the AE involved.
     2.5.5.4. Vehicles on the road should suffer little damage, unless they are hit by a
     fragment or the blast causes a momentary loss of control.
     2.5.5.5. Aircraft may suffer some damage to the fuselage from blast and possible
     fragment penetration, but should be operational with minor repair.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     51


       2.5.5.6. Cargo-type ships should suffer minor damage to deck structure and exposed
       electronics from blast and possible fragment penetration, but such damage should be
       readily repairable.
       2.5.5.7. Barricading is an effective control that can reduce the risk of injury or damage
       due to fragments for limited quantities of AE at a PES. When practical, suitably designed
       suppressive construction at the PES or protective construction at the ES may also provide
       some protection.
   2.5.6. Public Traffic Route Distance (over 250,000 lbs HE) – K30 (1.7 psi). At this distance:
       2.5.6.1. Unstrengthened buildings can be expected to sustain damage that may
       approximate 10 percent of their replacement cost.
       2.5.6.2. Occupants of exposed, unstrengthened structures may be injured by secondary
       blast effects, such as falling building debris.
       2.5.6.3. Pilots of aircraft that are landing or taking off may lose control and crash.
       2.5.6.4. Parked military and commercial aircraft will likely sustain minor damage due to
       blast, but should remain airworthy.
       2.5.6.5. Although personnel in the open are not expected to be killed or seriously injured
       by blast effects, fragments and debris may cause some injuries. The extent of these
       injuries will largely depend upon the PES structure, the NEWQD, and the fragmentation
       characteristics of the AE involved.
       2.5.6.6. Barricading or the application of minimum fragmentation distance requirements
       are effective controls that may reduce the risk of injury or damage due to fragments for
       limited quantities of AE at a PES.
   2.5.7. Inhabited Building Distance (IBD) – K40 to K50 (1.2 psi to 0.90 psi). At this
   distance:
       2.5.7.1. Unstrengthened buildings can be expected to sustain damage that approximates
       five percent of their replacement cost.
       2.5.7.2. Personnel in buildings are provided a high degree of protection from death or
       serious injury; however, glass breakage and building debris may still cause some injuries.
       2.5.7.3. Personnel in the open are not expected to be injured seriously by blast effects.
       Fragments and debris may cause some injuries. The extent of injuries will depend upon
       the PES structure and the NEWQD and fragmentation characteristics of the AE involved.
              2.5.7.4. Elimination of glass surfaces is the best control. If determined to be
              necessary, reducing the use of glass or the size of any glass surfaces and the use of
              blast resistant glass will provide some relief. For new construction, building design
              characteristics, to include consideration of how any required glass surfaces are
              oriented and use of blast resistant glass, can reduce glass breakage and structural
              damage.

Section 2B—Principal Effects of HD 1.2 Events.

2.6. Blast.
 52                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   2.6.1. HD 1.2, when not stored with HD 1.1 or HD 1.5, is not expected to mass detonate. In
   an incident involving HD 1.2, when stored by itself or with HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 (a
   HD 1.2 event), AE can be expected to both explode sporadically and burn. Fire will
   propagate through the mass of the AE over time. Some AE may neither explode nor burn.
   Blast effects from the incident are limited to the immediate vicinity and are not considered to
   be a significant hazard.
   2.6.2. A HD 1.2 event may occur over a prolonged period of time. Generally, the first
   reactions are relatively nonviolent and, typically, begin a few minutes after flames engulf the
   AE. Later reactions tend to be more violent. Reactions can continue for some time (hours),
   even after a fire is effectively out. Generally, smaller AE tends to react earlier in an incident
   than larger AE.
   2.6.3. The results of an accidental explosion in an underground facility will depend on the
   type and quantity of munitions, the type of explosion produced, and the layout of the facility.
   Hazards created outside the underground facility will likely not be as severe as those
   produced by HD 1.1 or 1.3 material.
2.7. Fragments.
   2.7.1. The primary hazard from a HD 1.2 event is fragmentation. Fragmentation may
   include primary fragments from AE casings or secondary fragments from containers and
   structures. At longer ranges, primary fragments are the major contributors to fragment
   hazards.
   2.7.2. During a HD 1.2 event, fragmentation may extensively damage exposed facilities.
   However, less fragmentation damage can be expected from a given quantity of HD 1.2 than
   would be expected from the corresponding quantity of HD 1.1 because not all the HD 1.2
   will react.
2.8. Thermal Hazards.
   2.8.1. An incident involving a quantity of HD 1.2 poses considerably less thermal risk to
   personnel than an incident involving corresponding quantities of either HD 1.1 or HD 1.3
   because a HD 1.2 event’s progressive nature allows personnel to immediately evacuate the
   area.
   2.8.2. A HD 1.2 event’s progressive nature provides an opportunity for a fire suppression
   system, if installed, to put out a fire in its early stages.
2.9. Ejected Items. In HD 1.2 events, a reaction may eject (lob) unreacted-AE or AE
components from the event site. These ejected items may subsequently react.
2.10. Propelled Items. In HD 1.2 events, some AE or AE components may become propulsive
and travel well beyond IBD.
2.11. Firebrands. In an incident involving only HD 1.2 or HD 1.2 with HD 1.4, firebrands are
considered to be a hazard only in the immediate vicinity of the incident site.
2.12. Expected Consequences.
   2.12.1. The expected consequences for HD 1.2 AE are similar to those for HD 1.1. The
   effects of HD 1.2 AE are NEWQD dependent.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                        53


   2.12.2. The principal hazard to personnel in the open, to aircraft, and to occupied vehicles is
   fragments.
   2.12.3. Airblast, fragment, and thermal hazards to buildings and parked aircraft or vehicles
   cannot be predicted reliably because the effects will depend on the maximum credible event
   (MCE).

Section 2C—Principal Effects of HD 1.3 Events

2.13. Gas Pressures. In an incident involving only HD 1.3 or HD 1.3 with HD 1.4 (a HD 1.3
event):
   2.13.1. Where sufficient venting is provided, gas pressures generated by the event are not a
   significant concern. Examples of sites with sufficient venting include open storage and
   structures where internal pressures do not exceed 1 to 2 psi (non-confinement structure).
   2.13.2. Where venting is insufficient, internal gas pressures may be substantial. In such
   situations, these pressures may blow out vent panels or frangible walls and, in some
   instances, cause partial or complete structural failure.
   2.13.3. Where there is minimal venting and structural containment (extreme confinement), a
   detonation of the HD 1.3 may occur with effects similar to those of a HD 1.1 explosion. For
   example, HD 1.3 AE is considered as HD 1.1 (mass explosion) for QD purposes when stored
   in underground chambers.
2.14. Fragments. In a HD 1.3 event, fragments are considerably less hazardous than those
produced by HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 events. Internal gas pressures may produce fragments from the
bursting of containers or the rupture of containment facilities. In general, such fragments will be
large and of low velocity. (For exceptions, see paragraph 2.13.3.)
2.15. Thermal Hazards. In a HD 1.3 event, heat flux presents the greatest hazard to personnel
and assets. HD 1.3 substances include both fuel components and oxidizers. Burning HD 1.3
emits fuel-rich flammable gases, fine particles, or both. This unburned material may ignite when
it comes in contact with air and cause a large fireball. This fireball will expand radially from the
ignition site and could wrap around obstacles, even those designed to provide line-of-sight
protection from HD 1.1 events. Shields and walls can be designed to provide protection from
thermal effects (see Chapter 4).
   2.15.1. The nominal spherical fireball that would be expected from the rapid burning of HD
   1.3 can be calculated by DFIRE = 10 x WEFF1/3 where DFIRE is the diameter of the fireball (ft)
   and WEFF is the quantity of HD 1.3 involved (lb), multiplied by a 20% safety factor (e.g., W
   of 100 pounds = WEFF of 120 pounds).
   2.15.2. In addition to the fireball itself, the thermal flux from the fireball can ignite fires out
   to intermagazine distance (IMD).
2.16. Propelled Items. In a HD 1.3 event, some AE or AE components may become propulsive
and travel well beyond IBD.
2.17. Firebrands. In a HD 1.3 event, a severe fire-spread hazard may result from firebrands
projected from the incident site. Firebrands can be expected to be thrown more than 50 ft from a
 54                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


HD 1.3 event. Firebrands can ignite fires well beyond the distance to which a fireball poses a
threat.
2.18. Expected Consequences.
       2.18.1. Exposed personnel may receive severe burns from fireballs or flash burning in a
       HD 1.3 event. The hazard distance is dependent on the quantity and burning rate of the
       HD 1.3 involved.
       2.18.2. Buildings, vehicles, and aircraft may be ignited by radiant heat, sparks, or
       firebrands or may be damaged by heat (searing, buckling, etc.).
       2.18.3. Personnel in nearby buildings, vehicles, or aircraft may be injured unless
       evacuated before heat conditions reach hazardous levels.

Section 2D—Principal Effects of HD 1.4 Events

2.19. Blast. There is no blast associated with an incident involving only HD 1.4 (a HD 1.4
event).
2.20. Fragments. A HD 1.4 event will not produce fragments of appreciable energy (i.e.,
greater than 14.8 ft-lbs). (Note: Fragments from HD 1.4S have energies less than or equal to 5.9
ft-lbs.)
2.21. Thermal Hazards. AE given this designation are considered to provide only a moderate
fire hazard. A fireball or jet of flame may extend 3 feet beyond the location of the HD 1.4 event.
A burning time of less than 330 seconds (5.5 minutes) for 220 lbs of the HD 1.4 AE is expected.
2.22. Firebrands. No fiery projections are expected beyond 50 feet.
2.23. Compatibility Group (CG) S Items. HD 1.4 AE assigned a CG S (see paragraph
3.21.13) designation is the most benign of all AE. In a HD 1.4 event that only involves CG S,
the expected blast, thermal, and projection effects will not significantly hinder fire fighting or
other emergency responses.
2.24. Expected Consequences. There may be minor consequences (projection, fire, smoke,
heat, or loud noise) beyond the AE itself.

Section 2E—Principal Effects of HD 1.5 and HD 1.6 Events

2.25. HD 1.5 Effects. HD 1.5 effects are similar to those produced by HD 1.1, without the
fragmentation effects.
2.26. HD 1.6 Effects. HD 1.6 effects are similar to those produced by HD 1.3.

                                HAZARD CLASSIFICATION

Section 3A—DoD Hazard Classification System

3.1. Purpose of Hazard Classification. The DoD Hazard Classification System is designed to
reflect the type and degree of hazard associated with an AE item. It is used to determine the
degree of protection (such as distance separation) needed for various exposed locations and
people, and to determine which items can be safely stored together. Each AE item is assigned a
hazard classification based on the form in which it is normally available as well as its common
packaging, storage and transportation (commercial or military) configurations.
3.2. Responsibility for Hazard Classification. Air Force organizations that develop or are the
first to adopt AE items for use are responsible for obtaining DoD hazard classifications using the
procedures in Technical Order (T.O.) 11A-1-47, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Hazard
Classification Procedures. It is the program office’s responsibility to ensure AE items are
properly hazard classified before they enter Air Force installations.
3.3. Hazard Classification Authorities. The Air Force hazard classification authorities are
AFSC/SEW, AAC/SES, and 784 CBSG. Army and Navy hazard classification authorities are
listed in T.O. 11A-1-47.
3.4. Standards for Determining DoD Hazard Classification. Use the following resources to
identify AE hazard characteristics for storage and transportation purposes:
   3.4.1. T.O. 11A-1-47, as a basis for assigning hazard classifications to all AE for both
   storage and transportation applications.
   3.4.2. The applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials regulations
   per 49 CFR 171 to 177.
   3.4.3. The United Nations’ (UN) international system of classification developed for the
   transport of dangerous goods, ST/SG/AC.10/1/latest revision, Recommendations on the
   Transport of Dangerous Goods.
3.5. Description of DoD Hazard Classification System. The DoD hazard classification system
consists of nine hazard classes plus a Not-Regulated category, thirteen compatibility groups, five
sensitivity groups, and a parenthetical number.
   3.5.1. Hazard Classes.
       3.5.1.1. Class 1. AE is assigned to the class that represents an item’s predominant
       hazard characteristic. Class 1 applies to AE in which the explosive hazard predominates.
       The six Class 1 divisions used to indicate the character and predominance of explosive
       hazards. This Manual uses the term ―Hazard Division (HD)‖ to avoid repeatedly using
       the more cumbersome terminology ―Subdivision X of Division Y of Class Z.‖ The Class
       1 divisions and subdivisions are described in Section 3D. See Chapter 2 for detailed
       reaction effects of Class 1 AE.
       3.5.1.2. Classes 2 through 9. The DoD inventory includes AE items assigned to Class 2
       (compressed gas), Class 3 (flammable liquid), Class 4.1 (flammable solid), Class 5.1
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     59


       (oxidizer), Class 6.1 (poisonous materials), and Class 8 (corrosive materials). Although
       these items contain a small amount of explosives, the predominant hazard is not an
       explosive reaction. They are assigned to Classes 2 through 9 based on the predominant
       hazard. The DoD hazard classification system classifies articles that contain riot control
       substances, without explosives components, and bulk toxic chemical agents as HD
       6.1. Any item that contains explosives, but is not assigned to Class 1 due to its
       predominant hazard, is considered to have a net explosive weight of zero for QD
       determinations. Items that fall into this category do not contribute to the net explosive
       weight calculated for the storage site. Even though such items are assigned to another
       class, they will still have a DoD storage compatibility group designation, and may be
       combined in storage with compatible Class 1 items. When Classes 2 through 9
       ammunition items are stored alone, they do not require siting or licensing, except as an
       exposed site.
       3.5.1.3. Not-Regulated Category. This category applies when explosives and
       hazardous materials are present in an item, but not to the degree that criteria for
       assignment to one of the nine classes are met. Items that contain a hazardous material,
       but that have been designated Not-Regulated, do not require storage or handling as a
       hazardous material. The explosive weight of Not-Regulated items is not considered for
       QD purposes.
   3.5.2. Compatibility Groups. Compatibility Groups (CG) are used for segregating AE on
   the basis of similarity of function, features, and accident effects potential. In developing the
   various compatibility groups, these factors are considered: chemical and physical properties,
   design characteristics, inner and outer packaging configurations, hazard class and division,
   NEWQD, rate of deterioration, sensitivity to initiation, and effects of deflagration, explosion,
   or detonation. The compatibility groups are described in Section 3E.
   3.5.3. Sensitivity Groups. Sensitivity Groups (SG) are used for determining allowable net
   explosive weights where ARMCO Revetments or substantial dividing walls are used. The
   sensitivity groups are described in Section 3E.
   3.5.4. Parenthetical Number. A parenthetical number is used to indicate the minimum
   separation distance (in hundreds of feet) for protection from debris, fragments, and firebrands
   when distance alone is relied on for such protection. This number is placed to the left of the
   hazard classification designators (e.g., (12)1.1, (08)1.2.3, or (02)1.3). It is assigned for all
   HD 1.2.3 items, and some HD 1.1 and 1.3 items.
3.6. Net Explosive Weight and Net Explosive Weight for Quantity-Distance. The Net
Explosives Weight (NEW) listed in DoD Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS) is the total
weight of all explosive, propellant, and pyrotechnic material in a single article. The NEW is
identified because transportation regulations require documentation of the NEW on shipping
papers for transportation. However, the NEWQD is used for explosives siting. The NEWQD is
equal to the NEW unless hazard classification testing has shown that a lower weight is
appropriate for QD purposes. If the NEWQD is less than the NEW, the reason is usually that
propellant or other substances do not contribute as much to the blast effect as the same amount of
high explosives would.
3.7. Requirement for DoD Hazard Classification. Except as allowed in Section 3B, DoD
hazard classifications are required as follows:
 60                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   3.7.1. Interim hazard classification must be assigned to explosives items under development,
   test articles, components, and certain explosive commercial products having no final hazard
   classification if they are to be stored on DoD property or transported. DoD hazard
   classification authorities document the interim classification in letters. These letters must be
   included in storage and shipment documentation until the classification is finalized. The
   agency obtaining the interim hazard classification must renew it upon termination (as
   specified in the letter). This applies if the item is still in the inventory or until final hazard
   classification is determined. Interim DoD hazard classifications assigned by Army and Navy
   classification authorities are acceptable to the Air Force.
   3.7.2. A final hazard classification must be assigned for explosives items that have become
   operationally fielded and items requiring commercial shipping outside CONUS. DoD final
   hazard classifications are listed in the JHCS. Access to the JHCS can be made through the
   Defense Ammunition Center at https://www3.dac.army.mil/.                 Final DoD hazard
   classifications assigned by Army and Navy hazard classification authorities are acceptable to
   the Air Force.

Section 3B—Storage and Transportation Without DoD Hazard Classification

3.8. Storage and Transportation Without DoD Hazard Classification. Occasionally it will
be necessary to store or transport explosive substances or articles that do not have DoD-assigned
final or interim hazard classifications. Since such items are not listed in the JHCS, the unit
having custody of these items must exercise care in maintaining appropriate approval and hazard
classification documentation at the storage installation. Such documentation may include
Department of Energy (DOE) interim hazard classifications, DOT EX-numbers, or locally-
assigned storage hazard classifications established in accordance with procedures approved by
the AFSC. Paragraphs 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 describe the circumstances and the respective
applicable conditions for storing or transporting AE without DoD hazard classification.
3.9. Explosives With DOE Hazard Classifications.
   3.9.1. An item covered by a DOE interim hazard classification may be stored and offered for
   military or commercial transportation using that classification, subject to the requirements of
   paragraph 3.9.3. A copy of the applicable DOE interim hazard classification must be
   maintained at the installation where the items are stored, and must be carried with shipping
   papers on board each conveyance being used to transport the items under that interim hazard
   classification.
   3.9.2. An item covered by a DOE final hazard classification may be stored and offered for
   military or commercial transportation using that classification, subject to the requirements of
   paragraph 3.9.3. For storage using DOE final hazard classifications, installation records
   must reflect the DOT EX-number, Class, Division, Compatibility Group, and NEW for each
   item stored.
   3.9.3. Restrictions on the use of DOE hazard classifications:
       3.9.3.1. Treat DOE assigned HD 1.2 as HD 1.2.1 and DOE assigned HD 1.5 as HD 1.1
       unless an Air Force hazard classification authority (see paragraph 3.3) determines a
       different hazard classification applies.
       3.9.3.2. Use the compatibility group assigned by DOE.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  61


       3.9.3.3. The NEWQD will equal the NEW. For quantity-distance purposes, the
       NEWQD of articles hazard classified by DOE as HD 1.4S or as Not-Regulated will equal
       zero. See paragraph 3.16.4 for MCE for HD 1.2.1.
       3.9.3.4. Items must be stored or transported in the same or equivalent packaging in
       which they were hazard classified.
3.10. DoD-Owned Non-Stock-Listed Commercial Explosives. A unit may have a
requirement to purchase a non-stock-listed commercial explosive product for evaluation or use.
Although such items are not standard military inventory items, they are DoD-owned explosives
once purchased. Commercial products are items that are not unique to military use and that are
legally available for purchase and use by the general public or private businesses. Examples are
commercial small arms ammunition, components and propellants; power tool cartridges; fire
extinguisher cartridges; signal devices; pest control devices; theatrical special effects items;
commercial demolition materials; and blasting agents. The following requirements apply to such
explosives:
   3.10.1. Hazard Classification. The unit may request a DoD interim hazard classification
   for a non-stock-listed commercial explosive item. Alternatively, store and offer the item for
   military or commercial transportation using the classification assigned for the product by
   DOT, subject to the requirements of paragraph 3.10.8. The classification assigned to
   commercial small arms cartridges by the manufacturer as prescribed in 49 CFR 173.56(h)
   may also be used for storage and transportation without a DoD hazard classification.
   3.10.2. Requirements for Purchase.
       3.10.2.1. Prior to purchase of a non-stock-listed commercial explosive item for
       operational use, the requirements below must be accomplished. Requirements for non-
       stock-listed commercial explosives for research and development activities will comply
       with 3.10.2.1.2. and applicable MAJCOM supplements to this Manual.
           3.10.2.1.1. Safety certification of the item must be obtained as specified in AFI 91-
           205, Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board.
           3.10.2.1.2. Approval for purchase must be obtained from 784 CBSG. Submit
           requests for approval according to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance
           Management.
       3.10.2.2. Emergency requirements to purchase non-stock-listed commercial explosives
       are approved by AFSC/SEW.
   3.10.3. Adoption into the DoD Inventory. Commercial explosive items adopted as standard
   DoD inventory items, as evidenced by centralized item management by an Air Logistics
   Center (ALC) or by another military service and assignment of a National Stock Number
   (NSN), must be covered by a DoD interim or final hazard classification.
   3.10.4. Commercial Fireworks. Commercial fireworks may not be purchased by the Air
   Force under any circumstances.
   3.10.5. A commercial product received as Black Powder for Small Arms, Class 4.1,
   Identification Number NA0027, must be stored as Black Powder, HD 1.1D.
 62                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   3.10.6. A commercial product received as Smokeless Powder for Small Arms, Class 4.1,
   Identification Number NA3178, must be stored as Powder, Smokeless, HD 1.3C.
   3.10.7. A commercial product received as Cartridges, Small Arms, ORM-D, must be stored
   as HD 1.4C unless a different hazard classification is issued by a DoD or DOE interim
   hazard classification authority and is on file at the installation.
   3.10.8. DOT Hazard Classifications. For storage using DOT hazard classifications,
   installation files shall reflect the DOT EX-number, Class, Division, Compatibility Group,
   and NEW, for each item stored.
       3.10.8.1. Items classed by DOE or DOT as HD 1.2 must be treated as HD 1.2.1, and HD
       1.5 must be treated as HD 1.1, or contact an Air Force hazard classification authority (see
       paragraph 3.2) to determine if a different hazard classification might apply.
       3.10.8.2. Use the compatibility group assigned by DOT.
       3.10.8.3. The NEWQD will equal the NEW. For quantity-distance purposes, the
       NEWQD of articles hazard classified by DOT as HD 1.4S or as Not-Regulated will equal
       zero. See paragraph 3.16.4 for MCE for HD 1.2.1.
       3.10.8.4. Items must be stored or transported in the same or equivalent packaging in
       which they were hazard classified.
3.11. Manufacturing, Research and Development Items. In manufacturing, research and
development environments, explosives samples, substances, subassemblies, and items may be
acquired, produced, and stored without DoD, DOT or DOE hazard classifications, provided they
comply with paragraph 3.10.2.1.2 and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
   3.11.1. These items may be stored and transported on-base in accordance with locally
   assigned hazard classifications provided a formal procedure for establishing and
   documenting the hazard classifications is approved by the MAJCOM/SEW and AFSC/SEW.
   3.11.2. These items shall not be offered for transportation from the installation or
   development location until the necessary DoD, DOT or DOE hazard classification is
   assigned. (Traversing a public roadway between gates or sites on the same installation is
   considered on-base transportation provided the transportation is in a DoD-owned vehicle
   operated by DoD personnel.)
   3.11.3. These items must have Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) procedures available
   prior to use. The responsible test organization will ensure local EOD activities receive a
   Source Data Package (SDP) prior to delivery of test assets. The SDP will be developed
   according to DID DI-SAFT-80931, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Data and TO 00-5-3, AF
   Technical Manual Acquisition Procedures.
3.12. Foreign Explosives. Foreign-owned military AE items brought onto Air Force
installations to support multinational military training, exercises, operations or cargo airlift
operations may be stored in accordance with the hazard classifications assigned by the
appropriate foreign competent authorities, provided:
   3.12.1. MAJCOMs document procedures for obtaining AFSC/SEW approval of these items.
   3.12.2. The procedures required in paragraph 3.12.1 must:
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      63


       3.12.2.1. Require MAJCOM/SEW to attain and forward to AFSC/SEW shipping
       documents for each foreign munitions item requiring hazard classification.
       3.12.2.2. Require the installation to maintain documentation of AFSC/SEW review and
       approval of each item.
       3.12.2.3. Require the installation to maintain documentation of the foreign hazard
       classification of each item.
       3.12.3. Hazard classification documentation approved by the coalition forces’ competent
       authorities for their explosives and munitions is acceptable (in lieu of interim hazard
       classifications) for military air transportation between the foreign departure points and
       foreign destinations, regardless of whether an intermediate stopover in the United States
       occurs. Such approval documentation is similarly acceptable for in-transit storage of
       coalition forces’ explosives and munitions on U.S. installations worldwide. The coalition
       approval documentation must, as a minimum, include in English: the assigned proper
       shipping name, United Nations identification number, hazard class/division and
       compatibility group, and the quantity of articles per package. Copies of the coalition
       hazard classification approval documentation must accompany military air shipments and
       be kept on file at installations where coalition forces’ explosives and munitions are
       temporarily stored during transit. Explosives and munitions classed HD 1.2 by coalition
       forces’ competent authorities will be managed as HD 1.2.1 when sited on real property
       controlled by the United States, or when possessed by U.S. forces.
   3.12.4. DoD Interim Hazard Classifications (IHC) assigned IAW T.O. 11A-1-47
   accompanying airlift cargo may be used without AFSC/SEW approval.
3.13. Non-DoD-Owned Explosives. Storage of non-DoD-owned explosives on Air Force
installations is prohibited except for specific exceptions stated in AFI 32-9003, Granting
Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property and 10 USC 2692 with 1998 Authorization Act
changes, Storage, treatment, and disposal of nondefense toxic and hazardous materials. Some of
these exceptions require approval from the SECAF or Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Environment). Units will forward requests through their MAJCOMs. Coordination will be
obtained from MAJCOM A7, A4, JA, SE and AFSC/SEW prior to fowarding to Air Force Real
Property Agency (AFRPA) for action. Paragraph 3.13.1 identifies situations that do not require
approval. When non-DoD-owned explosives are stored on an Air Force installation under one of
the exceptions, DOE or DOT hazard classifications may be used subject to the requirements in
paragraph 3.13.2. Commercial launch vehicles must also comply with paragraph 3.13.3.
   3.13.1. Situations Not Requiring Approval.
       3.13.1.1. Ammunition that is privately-owned by military members or their dependents
       can be stored on an Air Force installation, if the military member is assigned to that
       installation, or lives in billeting or a dormitory on that installation (see paragraph 7.41).
       3.13.1.2. Non-DoD-owned explosives that will be or have been used in connection with
       an activity of the DoD, or in connection with a service to be performed on a DoD
       installation for the benefit of the DoD, can be stored or disposed of on an Air Force
       installation (see paragraph 12.88).
64                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


     3.13.1.3. Non-DoD-owned explosives may be temporarily stored or disposed of on an
     Air Force installation in order to provide emergency lifesaving assistance to civil
     authorities (see paragraph 12.88).
     3.13.1.4. Non-DoD-owned explosives that constitute military resources intended to be
     used during peacetime civil emergencies in accordance with applicable DoD regulations
     may be stored on an Air Force installation (see paragraph 12.88).
     3.13.1.5. Explosives of other Federal agencies meeting the definition of ―DoD
     Explosives Operations/Storage‖ may be stored on an Air Force installation when no
     alternative solutions are available provided all other storage requirements can be met.
  3.13.2. DOE or DOT Hazard Classifications. For storage using a DOE interim hazard
  classification, a copy of the applicable DOE interim hazard classification must be maintained
  at the installation where the items are stored. For storage using a DOE final hazard
  classification, installation records must reflect the DOT EX-number, Class, Division,
  Compatibility Group, and NEW for each item stored. For storage using DOT hazard
  classifications, installation files shall reflect the DOT EX-number, Class, Division,
  Compatibility Group, and NEW, for each item stored. The following additional requirements
  apply:
     3.13.2.1. Items classed by DOE or DOT as HD 1.2 must be treated as HD 1.2.1, and HD
     1.5 must be treated as HD 1.1, or contact an Air Force hazard classification authority (see
     paragraph 3.3) to determine if a different hazard classification might apply.
     3.13.2.2. Use the compatibility group assigned by DOE or DOT.
     3.13.2.3. The NEWQD will equal the NEW. For quantity-distance purposes, the
     NEWQD of articles hazard classified by DOE or DOT as HD 1.4S or as Not-Regulated
     will equal zero. See paragraph 3.16.4 for MCE for HD 1.2.1.
     3.13.2.4. Items must be stored or transported in the same or equivalent packaging in
     which they were hazard classified.
     3.13.2.5. A commercial product received as Black Powder for Small Arms, Class 4.1,
     Identification Number NA0027, must be stored as Black Powder, HD 1.1D.
     3.13.2.6. A commercial product received as Smokeless Powder for Small Arms, Class
     4.1, Identification Number NA3178, must be stored as Powder, Smokeless, HD 1.3C.
     3.13.2.7. A commercial product received as Cartridges, Small Arms, ORM-D, must be
     stored as HD 1.4C unless a different hazard classification is issued by a DoD or DOE
     interim hazard classification authority and is on file at the installation.
  3.13.3. Commercial Launch Vehicles.
     3.13.3.1. The responsible commander must contact the responsible MAJCOM/SEW,
     who will in turn contact AFSC/SEW hazard classification authority for the assignment of
     an HD 1.3 hazard classification of a rocket motor.
     3.13.3.2. For commercial launch vehicles fueled by liquid propellants, the explosive
     equivalents of the fuel combinations (see Section 12N) may be used instead of the total
     weight of fuel in the vehicle for quantity-distance purposes. Lesser weights, based on
     launch vehicle failure analyses, may be used with the approval of AFSC/SEW and
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     65


       DDESB. Likewise, a commercial solid rocket booster or booster section located at a
       DoD range launch facility may be stored using an NEWQD less than 100 percent of the
       propellant weight only with approval of AFSC/SEW and DDESB.

Section 3C—Hazard Classification of Unpackaged Items

3.14. Hazard Classification of Unpackaged Items. When ammunition or explosive items are
not in the form and packaging in which they are normally stored and shipped, different hazard
classifications may apply due to changes in spacing, orientation, confinement, and other
factors. Sometimes testing of unpackaged components may be required in order to demonstrate
the validity of classifications used for siting unpackaged ammunition, or conservative
assumptions must be made about the potential severity of an accidental explosion. Contact an
Air Force hazard classification authority (see paragraph 3.3) for assistance in determining the
hazard classification of an unpackaged item.
   3.14.1. The hazard classification for some unpackaged items may be given in paragraph
   3.14.2. or in the item T.O. Items designated as Not-Regulated, CG S, were classed based on
   how the unpackaged item reacts. Therefore the presence or absence of packaging does not
   change that designation.
   3.14.2. The following are hazard classifications for certain unpackaged items:
       3.14.2.1. Cartridges, 40mm, HEDP, M433 stored in CNU 541/E Containers (modified
       MK 387 MOD 0 containers with CEMCOM buffer liners) are HD 1.2.2, with an
       NEWQD of 0.102 pounds per cartridge. This hazard classification is for storage only,
       not for transportation. (Note: CNU 541/E Containers are no longer available; this
       information is provided for existing containers.)
       3.14.2.2. Cartridges, 40mm, GP, M406 stored in 18-round Ammunition Carrying Vests
       folded into M2A1 or M548 Ammunition Cans with plastic projectile covers installed are
       hazard classified as HD 1.2.2E, SG-3. This hazard classification is for storage only and
       requires each cartridge to be securely nested into a projectile cover made by cutting the 3-
       round plastic supports from approved bandoleer packs into single-round supports. This
       hazard classification is for storage only, not for transportation.
          3.14.2.2.1. 40mm HE/HEDP are HD 1.1. when out of approved packaging
          configuration.
       3.14.2.3. 20mm and 30mm HEI cartridges, which are designated HD 1.2.2 packaged,
       remain HD 1.2.2 when unpackaged.
       3.14.2.4. Cartridges for small arms which have inert or tracer projectiles, are below .50
       caliber, and are not in their standard packaging are classified as HD 1.4S when kept in
       closed metal ammunition boxes. They are considered HD 1.4C in other containers.
       3.14.2.5. CBU-87/89/97/103/104/105, T-1 Versions, are considered HD 1.2.2 out of their
       shipping container.
       3.14.2.6. 2.75-in Infrared Illuminating Warheads (M278) and the 2.75-in White
       Phosphorus Warheads (M156) stored in a LAU-131 launcher or transportation module
       (out of shipping containers) are classified as HD 1.2.1. This hazard classification does
       not apply to public transportation.
 66                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   3.14.2.7. HD 1.3 Minuteman and HD 1.3 Peacekeeper missile stages with an HD 1.1 type
   (CL1/AODS) destruct system installed are considered HD 1.3.

Section 3D—Class 1 Divisions and Subdivisions

3.15. HD 1.1 – Mass-explosion.
   3.15.1. Blast is the primary hazard in this division. HD 1.1 items may be expected to mass-
   detonate when a small portion is initiated by any means. These explosions generally cause
   severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Propagation may occur so rapidly to
   unprotected explosives stored near the initially exploding stack that the quantities must be
   considered as a single source for QD purposes. The combined shock wave, in this case, is
   the same as a single detonation of a charge equal to the total of the stacks (see simultaneous
   detonation in Attachment 1).
   3.15.2. Items in this division also generally present a fragmentation hazard, either from the
   case of the explosive device or from the packaging or facility in which the explosives are
   stored.
   3.15.3. HD 1.1 items include bulk high explosives, some propellants, mines, bombs,
   demolition charges, some missile warheads, some rockets, palletized projectiles loaded with
   bulk trinitrotoluene (TNT) or Comp B, mass-detonating cluster bomb units (CBU), and
   ammunition components having mass-detonating characteristics.
3.16. HD 1.2 – Non-mass Explosion, Fragment Producing.
   3.16.1. Items in this division will not mass detonate when configured for storage or
   transportation if a single item or package is initiated. When these items function, the results
   are burning and exploding progressively with no more than a few reacting at a time. The
   explosion will throw fragments, firebrands, and non-functioned items from the point of
   initiation. Blast effects are limited to the immediate vicinity and are not the primary hazard.
   3.16.2. In an incident, the quantity distances specified for HD 1.2 items achieve the desired
   degree of protection against immediate hazards. Events involving HD 1.2 items lob large
   amounts of unexploded rounds, components, and subassemblies, which remain hazardous
   after impact. Such items are likely to be more hazardous than they were in their original state
   because fuze safety devices or other features may sustain heat and impact damage. Expect
   the sub-munitions, such as cluster bombs, of many types of munitions,to project distances as
   great as the relevant inhabited building distances. Furthermore, it is impractical to specify
   quantity distances which allow for the maximum possible flight ranges of propulsive items.
   3.16.3. HD 1.2 items’ functioning effects vary with the size and weight of the item. These
   items are separated into three subdivisions (1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3) to account for the differences
   in magnitude of these effects and to set quantity-distance criteria.
   3.16.4. HD 1.2.1. Generally, these items have an NEWQD greater than 1.60 pounds or
   exhibit fragmentation characteristics similar to or greater than (higher density, longer
   distance) M1 105 mm projectiles regardless of NEWQD. The MCE for a specific HD 1.2.1
   item is the largest quantity of explosives expected to explode at one time when a stack of
   those specific items is involved in a fire. MCEs will be included in the JHCS for each HD
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      67


   1.2.1 item. If the MCE is not available, use the default MCE determined by multiplying
   NEWQD in a single container by three.
   3.16.5. HD 1.2.2. Generally, these items have an NEWQD less than or equal to 1.60 pounds
   or that at most exhibit fragmentation characteristics similar to high-explosive 40mm
   ammunition regardless of NEWQD.
   3.16.6. HD 1.2.3. These items do not exhibit any sympathetic detonation response in the
   stack test, or any reaction more severe than burning in the external fire test, bullet impact
   test, or slow cook-off test.
3.17. HD 1.3 – Mass Fire, Minor Blast or Fragment. Items in this division burn vigorously
and the fires are difficult to put out. Explosions are caused by pressure ruptures of containers,
which may produce fragments (especially missile motors) but will not produce propagating
shock waves or damaging blast overpressure beyond intermagazine distance. Burning container
materials, propellant, firebrands, or other debris may be projected randomly, presenting a severe
fire hazard. Depending on the amounts of burning explosive materials, their downwind toxic
effects usually do not extend beyond inhabited building distances.
3.18. HD 1.4 – Moderate Fire, No Significant Blast or Fragment. Items in this divison
present a fire hazard but no blast hazard. There is virtually no fragmentation or toxic hazard
beyond the fire hazard clearance ordinarily specified for high-risk materials.
3.19. HD 1.5 – Explosive Substance, Very Insensitive (With Mass Explosion
Hazard). Substances in this division have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that
there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under
normal transport or storage conditions.
3.20. HD 1.6 – Explosive Article, Extremely Insensitive. Items in this division contain only
extremely insensitive detonating substances (EIDS), and demonstrate a negligible probability of
accidental ignition or propagation. Fuzed HD 1.6 items must contain either an EIDS fuze or a
non-explosive fuze (i.e. the fuze contains no explosives), otherwise the item is classified as HD
1.2.3.

  3.21.4. Group D. This group includes bulk black powder and bulk HE. It also includes AE
  which has no propelling charge, but does contain HE without its own means of initiation, i.e.,
  there isn’t an initiating device present or the device has two or more effective protective
  features. Examples include TNT, Composition B, and black powder; bulk wet RDX or
  PETN; bombs, projectiles, CBUs, depth charges, and torpedo warheads.
  3.21.5. Group E. AE in this group contains high explosive (HE) without its own means of
  initiation but with, or containing, a solid propelling charge. Examples include artillery AE,
  rockets, and guided missiles.
  3.21.6. Group F. AE in this group contains HE with its own means of initiation, i.e., the
  initiating device present has less than two effective protective features, and may or may not
  have a solid propelling charge. Examples include grenades, sounding devices, and similar
  items with less than two effective protective features in their explosive trains.
  3.21.7. Group G. This group includes illuminating, incendiary, and smoke- (including

  when exposed to the atmosphere. Examples include WP and plasticized white phosphorus
  (PWP).
  3.21.9. Group J. In this group, AE contain flammable liquids or gels other than those that
  are spontaneously flammable when exposed to water or the atmosphere. Examples include
  liquid or gelfilled incendiary AE, fuelair explosive (FAE) devices, and flammable
  liquidfueled missiles and torpedoes.
  3.21.10. Group K. In this group, AE contain toxic chemical agents or contain chemicals
  specifically designed for incapacitating effects more severe than lachrymation (tear-
  producing). Examples include artillery or mortar AE (fuzed or unfuzed), grenades, rockets
  and bombs filled with a lethal or incapacitating chemical agents. (See Table 7.1, Note 4.)
  3.21.11. Group L. This group contains AE not included in other CG, such as AE with

3.22. Sensitivity Groups. Where ARMCO or equivalent earth-filled steel bin revetments or
substantial dividing walls are used for storage purposes, each HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE item is
designated, based on its physical attributes, into one of five SG. Directed energy weapons are
further identified by assigning the suffix ―D‖ following the SG designation (e.g., SG2D). The
SG assigned to an AE item is listed in the JHCS (see paragraph 6.28.3 for application and use of
SG criteria with substantial dividing walls to prevent prompt detonation reactions to adjacent
rooms or cubicles). Item-specific testing or analyses can be used to change an item’s SG. The
five SG, in relative order from least sensitive to most sensitive, are:
   3.22.1. SG 2. Non-robust (see glossary in Attachment 1) military munitions.
   3.22.2. SG 1. Robust (see glossary in Attachment 1) military munitions.
   3.22.3. SG 3. Fragmenting military munitions.
   3.22.4. SG 4. Cluster bombs or dispenser unit military munitions (see glossary in
   Attachment 1).
       3.22.5. SG 5. Sympathetic detonation (SD) sensitive military munitions.

                                            Chapter 4

                 RISK ASSESSMENTS AND PROTECTION PRINCIPLES

Section 4A—Risk Assessments

4.1. Requirements for Risk Assessments. Risk assessments are required for all new or
modified explosives, explosives operations, equipment and facilities when not specifically
covered in current AF guidance and/or approved publications. These risk assessments will be
used to identify design and operations criteria (e.g., shielding, protective clothing). See Chapter
2 for reaction effect information to support risk assessments. The risk assessment will consider
the following factors, as appropriate:
   4.1.1. Initiation sensitivity.
   4.1.2. Quantity of materials.
   4.1.3. Heat output.
   4.1.4. Rate of burn.
   4.1.5. Potential ignition and initiation sources.
   4.1.6. Protection capabilities of shields, types of clothing, and fire protection systems.
   4.1.7. Personnel exposure.
4.2. Risk Assessments.
   4.2.1. Explosives safety criteria in this Manual help commanders make informed decisions
   on the proper mix of combat readiness and safety. This criteria specifies minimum
   acceptable standards for explosives safety. Compliance with these criteria still entails a
   significant risk to personnel, assets and facilities. Risk management (RM) (see paragraph
   4.3) may be used to further reduce, mitigate, or accept risks.
   4.2.2. Explosives risk assessments are a subset of the commander’s overall risk management
   program. An explosives risk assessment analyzes hazards associated with transporting,
   storing, disposing of, handling or firing ammunition and explosive materials. Explosives risk
   ssessments may range from examining the relationship between a PES and an ES to
   determine what effect one has on the other in the event of an accidental explosion, to
   ascertaining the worst credible event ramifications of an explosives handling mishap.
   Although risk assessments are required when explosives standards cannot be met, they shall
   also be routinely used in other instances as a commander’s management tool. For example,
   combat loaded aircraft parked on an open ramp, separated by K11, meet the required QD
   separation per this Manual. However, commanders shall also be advised that in this situation
   the total destruction of adjacent aircraft is certain and that a delayed propagation is likely in
   the event of an explosion on one of the combat loaded aircraft. The commander shall also be
   apprised of the probability of such an event happening.
4.3. Risk Management (RM). According to AFI 90-901, Risk Management, the following RM
principles apply: (1) Accept no unnecessary risk, (2) Make risk decisions at the appropriate level,
(3) Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs, (4) Integrate RM into Air Force Doctrine and
planning at all levels. Refer to AFPAM 90-902, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools,
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                        71


for methods on eliminating or reducing risk to support the six-step process of RM (see Figure
4.1). The RM process may not be used to violate directives or other regulatory guidance; normal
waiver or variance procedures must be followed in all cases. For exceptions to criteria in this
Manual, refer to Section 1B.
4.4. System Safety. System safety is the application of engineering and management principles,
criteria, and techniques to optimize all aspects of safety within the constraints of operational
effectiveness, time, and cost throughout all phases of the system life cycle. The system safety
process is governed by MIL-STD-882D, System Safety, and is intended to ensure hazards are
identified early enough in the design phase of a program to either remove them through
engineering design changes or to mitigate the associated risk to an acceptable level. Similar to
the RM process, the system safety process requires the remaining risk to be accepted by the
appropriate authority.
4.5. Professional Assistance for Risk Assessments and System Safety Analyses. Units may
experience situations when civil, structural, electrical, safety, etc. engineering support is required
to perform a risk assessment or system safety analysis. There are numerous governmental and
non-governmental organizations available for professional assistance.                  Contact your
MAJCOM/SEW for assistance.

Section 4B—Munitions Systems and Equipment

4.6. Safety Certification of Munitions Systems. All operational non-nuclear munitions
systems used by the Air Force require safety certification as specified in AFI 91-205, Non-
Nuclear Munitions Safety Board. Risk assessments are accomplished, using the systems safety
process for all new or modified operational munitions systems as a part of this safety
certification process. The safety certification process ensures that residual risks are mitigated to
an acceptable level via engineering or procedural controls. Engineering controls are
incorporated into the design. Procedural controls are documented in item T.O.s, or other
operating procedures and instructions.
4.7. Risk Assessments for Explosives Equipment. Risk assessments for new or modified
explosives equipment are typically accomplished as part of the munitions safety certification
process (see paragraph 4.6) and resultant engineering controls are incorporated into the design.
Procedural controls are documented in the item T.O. or other operating procedures and
instructions. For explosives equipment unique to the local environment, perform a risk
assessment and document any required procedural controls in a locally written instruction (see
Section 7B).

Section 4C—Explosives Operations and Facilities

4.8. Risk Assessment for Explosives Operations. Risk assessments for new or modified
explosives operations are typically accomplished as part of the munitions safety certification
process (see paragraph 4.6) and resultant engineering controls are incorporated into the
munitions system, equipment, or facility design. Procedural controls are documented in the item
T.O. or other operating procedures and instructions. For explosives operations unique to the
local environment, risk assessments are implemented through the explosives site plan; document
any operational limitations in a locally written instruction to ensure safety (see Section 7B).
 72                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


4.9. Risk Assessments for Explosives Facilities.
   4.9.1. Responsible agencies perform risk assessments when they establish a definitive
   drawing for proposed new explosives facilities. No further risk assessments need to be
   accomplished.
   4.9.2. Design agents are responsible for the risk assessment of new or modified explosives
   facilities which do not have a definitive drawing. They must accomplish the risk assessment
   as part of the design process.
   4.9.3. When protective construction (see Section 6B) is required for the new or modified
   explosives facility (or any exposed facility), the requirement for risk assessments, systems
   safety analyses, and engineering analyses as well as the requirements for protective
   construction design must be included in the Requirements and Management Plan (RAMP)
   for military construction (MILCON) projects to ensure funding. Refer to AFI 32-1023,
   Design and Construction Standards and Execution of Facility Construction Projects, for
   further information on the RAMP. Weapons safety personnel from the organization
   responsible for the construction will advise Civil Engineering on which risk assessments and
   analyses are required and should be included in the RAMP and the contract.
   4.9.4. When protective construction is not required for the new or modified explosives
   facility (or any exposed facility), the explosives site plan will satisfy the risk assessment
   requirement.
   4.9.5. Risk assessments for modifications to explosives facilities will assess whether the
   modification will cause additional hazards or reduce the effectiveness of built-in safety
   features of the facility.

Section 4D—Glass Breakage Risk Assessments

4.10. Purpose of Glass Breakage Risk Assessments. In the event of an explosives mishap,
glass can present a significant hazard to personnel in exposed facilities out to distances well
beyond the IBD arc. Glass breakage risk assessments determine the extent of this hazard, and
identify potential mitigation techniques, to reduce the hazard to an acceptable level. If the hazard
cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, the glass breakage risk assessment can be used to
ensure the approving authority makes an informed risk acceptance decision.
4.11. Requirements for Performance of Glass Breakage Risk Assessments.
   4.11.1. Glass breakage risk assessments, performed in accordance with paragraph 4.13, are
   required as follows:
       4.11.1.1. For modification of an existing occupied facility within an IBD arc as described
       in paragraph 5.2.2.
       4.11.1.2. For modified operations in an existing occupied facility (when acting as an
       exposure) within an IBD arc. When the risk assessment reveals a hazard to personnel, use
       engineering mitigation actions (see paragraph 4.14), if feasible, to eliminate the hazard or
       reduce it to an acceptable level. Remaining risk must be accepted by the responsible
       commander.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    73


       4.11.1.3. For existing occupied facilities (when acting as an exposure) within the
       proposed IBD arc of a new PES. If the risk assessment shows there will be a hazard to
       personnel, use engineering mitigation actions (see paragraph 4.14), if feasible, to
       eliminate the hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. Remaining risk must be accepted
       by the responsible commander.
       4.11.1.4. For existing occupied facilities (when acting as an exposure) within the IBD arc
       of an existing PES where modified operations will increase the explosive hazard of the
       PES. If the risk assessment shows there will be a hazard to personnel, use engineering
       mitigation actions (see paragraph 4.14) if feasible to eliminate or reduce the hazard to an
       acceptable level. Remaining risk must be accepted by the responsible commander.
       4.11.1.5. For new occupied facilities located within the IBD arc of any existing PES.
   4.11.2. Glass breakage risk assessments are recommended in the following situations:
       4.11.2.1. As a baseline assessment for all existing occupied buildings within an existing
       IBD arc.
       4.11.2.2. As a baseline assessment for all existing occupied buildings of a sensitive
       nature (e.g. schools, off-base buildings, on-base buildings with significant public access
       such as a commissary, buildings with large amounts of glass panels, etc.) inside or near
       IBD arcs.
4.12. Software Tools for Glass Breakage Risk Assessments. Window Glazing Analysis
Response and Design (WINGARD PE) is the recommended tool to be used for performing glass
breakage risk assessments. Other glass analysis software as identified in DDESB TP 20,
Explosion Effects Software, may also be used. If software programs are not available,
information found in chapter 2 of this Manual may be used for performing basic glass breakage
risk assessments. See paragraph 4.13 for additional information.
   4.12.1. WINGARD PE outputs the expected results (break versus no-break) along with the
   expected distance of glass shard travel. It also shows the blast parameters experienced and
   the required bite. It provides charts and graphs showing glass displacement, velocity,
   acceleration, fragment flight, and more.
   4.12.2. WINGARD PE requires a great range of input parameters.
       4.12.2.1. Window size.
       4.12.2.2. Window location in relation to the PES.
       4.12.2.3. Window construction to include, but not limited to:
       4.12.2.3.1. Type of glass.
       4.12.2.3.2. Number of panes.
       4.12.2.3.3. Thickness of panes.
       4.12.2.3.4. Type of glazing.
   4.12.2.4. Use ¼‖ single pane annealed glass windows if these parameters cannot be
   determined for a worst case scenario analysis.
 74                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   4.12.3. WINGARD PE was developed for General Services Administration (GSA) by the
   Applied Research Associates Security Engineering Group. To obtain a free copy of the
   program, forward request through appropriate MAJCOM/SEW.
4.13. Methodology for Glass Breakage Risk Assessments.
   4.13.1. The tool(s) selected for performing a glass breakage risk assessments should be
   based on the intent of the analysis. For example, if the intent is to demonstrate windows will
   not break due to design, placement, or treatment, then a detailed software based assessment is
   required. If however, the intent is to only demonstrate a hazard exists and injuries are
   possible, the information found in chapter 2 of this Manual may be sufficient for obtaining
   responsible commanders risk acceptance.
   4.13.2. Glass breakage risk assessments should identify the risk to personnel from glass
   breakage and, if necessary, evaluate the effect of engineering mitigation actions (see
   paragraph 4.14) to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Protection level ―Medium‖ as
   defined in UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, or
   WINGARD PE performance condition 2 as defined in GSA-TS01-2003, Standard Test
   Methods for Glazing and Window Systems Subject to Dynamic Overpressure Loadings, are
   considered acceptable levels of protection.
   4.13.3. Glass breakage risk assessments should:
      4.13.3.1. Consider the presence and distance of personnel from glass panels.
      4.13.3.2. Evaluate the worst case event likely to expose glass panels to blast hazards.
      Glass panels that are exposed to multiple explosives facilities would necessitate
      evaluation only for the explosives facility that would place the maximum blast loading on
      the glass panels. Blast loading from HD 1.2.1 AE will be based on the MCE. Blast
      loading from HD 1.2.3 AE will be based on the NEWQD of the largest single round.
      4.13.3.3. Show the anticipated blast loading. For example, show which facility produces
      the blast loading, the actual separation distance, what HD and NEWQD produces the
      blast loading; and what the glass panel parameters (e.g., type, size, pane thickness) are.
      4.13.3.4. Identify engineering actions taken to mitigate the hazards to personnel from
      glass breakage.
4.14. Engineering Mitigation Actions for Reducing or Eliminating Glass Breakage
Hazards to Personnel.
   4.14.1. Minimize the number and size of glass panels.
   4.14.2. Orient the exposed facility to minimize blast loads on glass panels.
   4.14.3. Minimize or remove glass panels on the side of facilities which face explosives
   facilities.
   4.14.4. Use tempered glass which will break into small pieces with rounded edges.
   4.14.5. Use glazing, anti-shatter films, or net/blast curtains. Where films are used, the base
   fire department should note this type construction on pre-fire plans to facilitate fire-fighting
   personnel entry in emergency situations.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    75

Section 4E—Health Hazard and Environmental Assessments

4.15. Health Hazard Assessments. Using organizations must ensure Bioenvironmental
Engineering (BE) conducts a health hazard assessment of the work area and operation when dust
or concentrations of vapors, fumes, or gases from explosives, equipment, or other chemicals in
the work area are present. The squadron commander must accept bioenvironmental assessment
risks before operations may begin.
4.16. Environmental Assessments. Using organizations must ensure each explosives operation
is evaluated for compliance with environmental standards. The evaluation must include all
hazardous wastes generated during all phases of the operation. Written procedures will identify
requirements for the control, storage, and disposition of hazardous wastes.

Section 4F—Protection Principles

4.17. Protective Shielding and Remotely Controlled Operations. This paragraph does not
apply to rod and gun club operations.
   4.17.1. Equipment specialists will perform a risk assessment to determine if an operation
   requires protective shielding and must be remotely controlled for personnel protection.
   Specify shielding and remote control requirements in the item T.O. As a minimum,
   protective shielding must be made available to personnel when test procedures cannot ensure
   explosives are totally isolated and protected from potentially harmful environments such as
   electrical current or heat. Operations such as continuity checks of electrically actuated
   explosives devices, propellant cutting, explosives component assembly, modification, or
   disassembly and demilitarization may require shielding or be accomplished from a remote
   controlled location.
   4.17.2. When a risk assessment indicates that there is an unacceptable risk from an
   accidental explosion or a flash fire, personnel will be provided protection from blast,
   fragments and thermal effects, to include respiratory and circulatory hazards, as follows:
       4.17.2.1. Personnel protection must limit incident blast overpressure to 2.3 psi, fragments
       to energies of less than 58 ft-lb, and thermal fluxes to 0.3 calories per square centimeter
       per second.
       4.17.2.2. K24 distance provides the required level of protection for blast and thermal
       effects only.
       4.17.2.3. Shields that comply with MIL-STD-398, Shields, Operational for Ammunition
       Operations, Criteria for Design and Tests for Acceptance, provide acceptable protection
       for blast, thermal and fragment effects.
   4.17.3. The use of protective shielding or remotely controlled operations must be approved
   as part of the explosives site plan (see paragraph 14.25.3).
 76                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   4.17.4. The T.O. managing agency must ensure safe design and testing of specific protective
   devices when required by a T.O. Test for a 25-percent overload and obtain approval from the
   Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).
   4.17.5. When a using command establishes a requirement for protective devices, that
   command must ensure that these devices are of a safe design. Test for a 25-percent overload.
4.18. Intentional Ignition or Initiation of AE. At operations (e.g., function, proof, lot
acceptance testing) where intentional ignition or initiation of AE is conducted (except EOD
operational responses), the following requirements apply:
   4.18.1. Operating personnel protection will:
       4.18.1.1. Meet the requirements of paragraph 4.17.2.1.
       4.18.1.2. Contain or defeat all fragments.
       4.18.1.3. Limit thermal flux to ―Q‖ (calories/square centimeter/second) = 0.62t-0.7423
       where ―t‖ is the time in seconds that a person is exposed to the radiant heat. NOTE:
       Shields that comply with MIL-STD-398 provide acceptable protection. Comply with
       testing requirements of paragraph 4.17.4 or 4.17.5.
       4.18.1.4. Limit overpressure levels in personnel-occupied areas to satisfy MIL-STD-
       1474D, Noise Limits.
   4.18.2. The use of protective shielding must be approved as part of the explosives site plan
   (see paragraph 14.25.3).
   4.18.3. Areas used for intentional detonations meet the requirements of paragraphs 4.18.1.1
   through 4.18.1.3 for protection of essential personnel provided the QD requirements of
   paragraph 12.74.4.1 or 12.74.4.2 are met.
   4.18.4. EOD proficiency training ranges meet the requirements of paragraphs 4.18.1.1
   through 4.18.1.3 for protection of essential personnel provided the QD requirements of
   paragraph 12.76 are met.
   4.18.5. Static test firing of propellant-loaded items (see paragraph 12.78) must meet the
   requirements of paragraph 4.18.1 for protection of operating personnel.
4.19. Protective Measures. Personnel protection may be increased by:
   4.19.1. Eliminating or establishing positive control of ignition and initiation stimuli.
   4.19.2. Using sufficient distance or barricades to protect from blast or fragments.
   4.19.3. Using Substantial Dividing Walls (SDW) or properly rated fire walls to protect from
   fragment or thermal hazards.
   4.19.4. UFC 3-340-02, Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, contains
   design procedures to achieve personnel protection, protect facilities and equipment, and
   prevent propagation of explosions.
   4.19.5. Using fire detection and extinguishing systems (e.g., infra-red actuated deluge
   system) in those areas where exposed, thermally-energetic materials that have a high
   probability of ignition and a large thermal output are handled. Such systems must maximize
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    77


   the speed of detection, have adequate capacity to extinguish potential flash fires in their
   incipient state, and maximize the speed of the application of the extinguishing agent.
   4.19.6. Using thermal shielding between the thermal source and personnel in AE operational
   areas, where it is essential for personnel to be present and the risk assessment indicates that
   an in-process thermal hazard exists. Any shielding used must comply with MIL-STD-398.
   When shielding is either not possible or inadequate, to include a failure to protect exposed
   personnel's respiratory and circulatory systems, augmentation with improved facility
   engineering design and personnel protective clothing and equipment may be necessary.
   4.19.7. Using thermal protective clothing that is capable of limiting bodily injury to first
   degree burns (0.3 calories per square centimeter per second) with personnel taking
   turningevasive action, when the maximum quantity of combustible material used in the
   operation is ignited.
   4.19.8. Using protective clothing capable of providing respiratory protection from the
   inhalation of hot vapors or any toxicological effects, when the risk assessment indicates
   adverse effects would be encountered from the inhalation of combustion products.
4.20. Emergency Operations. If an immediately dangerous explosive situation is encountered,
all operations in the immediate vicinity will be shut down, personnel evacuated to a safe
location, and EOD personnel called to analyze and eliminate the hazard. Operations will not be
resumed until the hazard has been eliminated, removed, or otherwise determined to be safe by
EOD personnel. Installations without on-site EOD support must make pre-planned arrangements
for emergency measures such as bomb threats, hung flares, ground burst simulators, etc. These
arrangements must be coordinated with the MAJCOM Safety and EOD Functional Staff.
   4.20.1. Locations used repeatedly for the emergency destruction of recovered military
   ordnance or hazardous explosive devices should have a risk assessments pre-established and
   on file.
   4.20.2. Emergency destruction operations conducted at reduced QD ranges and non-standard
   destruction sites (e.g., EOD proficiency ranges or non-sited remote locations) may require
   the use of protective measures to limit fragmentation hazards. When the time and situation
   allows, emergency responders will use applicable technical data (e.g., joint EOD publications
   and DDESB Technical Paper 16) to apply protective measures. Construction of protective
   works should neither hinder the conduct of time-sensitive emergencies nor place emergency
   responders under increased risks.

Figure 4.1. Five Step Process for Risk Management




1. Identify the Hazards. Step one of the process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques
in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazards can be defined as any
real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation; injury, illness, death to personnel, damage to or loss
of equipment/ property.

2. Assess the Risks/Hazards. The assessment step involves the application of quantitative and/or qualitative
measures to determine the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks/hazards
and directly affect mission or activity success. This can be a formalized or intuitive process.

3. Make Risk Control Decision. Step three involves the evaluation of specific strategies and controls that reduce or
eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three components (probability,
severity or exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions must be made at the appropriate level for the identified risk.
The higher the risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure that an appropriate analysis of
overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Decision-makers must ultimately choose the most mission
supportive risk controls, consistent with RM principles that provide the best solution for the given hazards. Risk
decisions should never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when
the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered in time critical situations where delays
might endanger lives, resources or equipment.

4. Implement Risk Controls. Once control measures have been selected, an implementation strategy must be
developed and carried out. The strategy must identify the: who, what, when, where and cost(s) associated with the
control measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across all levels of leadership and
personnel associated with the action so that there is clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of
commanders and subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of risk regardless of
circumstances.

5. Supervise and Review. Risk Management is a process that continues throughout the life cycle of the system,
mission, or activity. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles in ensuring controls are
sustained over time. Once controls are in place, the process must be periodically reevaluated to ensure controls
remain effective and mission supportive over time. Note: For a more complete explanation of the 5-Stpe RM process
refer to AFPAM 90-902.

     GENERAL EXPLOSIVES FACILITY DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND
 MAINTENANCE, AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN, MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION

Section 5A—Introduction

5.1. Applicability.
   5.1.1. Unless otherwise specified, the design requirements in this chapter apply to all
   existing and new construction of explosives facilities, to include specific explosives facility
   designs covered in Chapter 6. Unless specifically excluded, the requirements in this chapter
   apply to licensed explosives storage locations and to locations involving explosives
   operations which do not require explosives siting. This chapter also provides requirements
   for the construction, maintenance, and repair of explosives facilities as well as equipment in
   these facilities.
   5.1.2. This chapter does not address extraordinarily hazardous situations (e.g., nitroglycerin
   manufacturing) that will require special consideration and design features. In these
   situations, the MAJCOM will develop specific design criteria.
   5.1.3. Additional criteria specific to nuclear weapons storage, handling, and maintenance
   facilities apply as provided in AFMAN 91-118, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for
   Nuclear Weapon Systems.

Section 5B—Glass Panels

5.2. Glass Panels in Facilities Exposed to Explosives Hazards.
   5.2.1. For construction of a new occupied facility within an IBD arc, do not use glass panels
   unless deemed operationally necessary. If the use of glass panels is deemed operationally
   necessary, comply with the following requirements, or process a deviation in accordance
   with paragraph 1.4:
       5.2.1.1. Design the panels so that they will not break under the expected blast loading;
       the framing and sash of such panels must be of sufficient strength to retain the panel in
       the structure under the expected blast loading. Or, design the panels so that they will
       withstand the same blast loading as the structure; the framing and sash of such panels
       must be of sufficient strength to retain the panel until the point of structural failure.
       5.2.1.2. Provide engineering analyses and design details, as part of the explosives site
       plan package, to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 5.2.1.1. The analyses must
       include the information addressed in paragraphs 4.13.2. and 4.13.3.
   5.2.2. For modification of an existing occupied facility within an IBD arc, remove existing
   glass panels, if practical, as part of the scope of modification. Do not add glass panels unless
   deemed operationally necessary. If existing glass panels are not removed, perform a glass
   breakage risk assessment (see paragraph 4.13); if the risk assessment shows there will be a
   hazard to personnel, use engineering mitigation actions (see paragraph 4.14) to eliminate the
   hazard or process a deviation in accordance with paragraph 1.4. If the addition of glass
 80                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   panels is deemed operationally necessary, comply with paragraphs 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 or
   process a deviation in accordance with paragraph 1.4.
   5.2.3. Existing glass panels that are replaced due to damage (i.e., cracked or broken) must be
   replaced with equivalent strength or stronger glass panels.
   5.2.4. Glass skylights will not be used in any facility within an IBD arc.

Section 5C—Hazardous Locations

5.3. Hazardous Locations. Comply with NFPA 70, National Electrical Code (NEC), Article
500, Hazardous (Classified) Locations, requirements for the design and installation of electrical
equipment and wiring for hazardous locations. Hazardous locations are those in which
combustible dusts, or flammable vapors or gases are or may be present in the air in quantities
sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures.
   5.3.1. The presence of explosives does not necessarily make an area a hazardous location.
   To ensure proper identification of a hazardous location, it is necessary to have knowledge of
   the properties of the explosives involved, especially thermal stability and sensitivity to heat
   and spark. Use NEC definitions, as modified below, to identify and classify hazardous
   locations involving explosives.
       5.3.1.1. Areas that contain vapors from explosives will be considered Class I hazardous
       locations.
       5.3.1.2. Areas in which explosive sublimation or condensation occur or may occur will
       be regarded as both Class I, Division 1 and Class II, Division 1.
       5.3.1.3. Areas containing explosives dusts or explosives that may, through handling,
       produce dust capable of being dispersed in the atmosphere will be regarded as Class II,
       Division 1.
   5.3.2. Some definitive drawings for explosives facilities may identify the presence of a
   hazardous location or require the installation of certain basic electrical equipment to meet
   NEC requirements.
5.4. Electrical Equipment in Hazardous Locations.
   5.4.1. Installation of electrical equipment in hazardous locations involving explosives will
   comply with NEC requirements for the appropriate hazardous location class, group and
   division.
   5.4.2. Equipment must be approved not only for the class of location, but also for the
   explosion properties of the specific gas, vapor, or dust that will be present.
   5.4.3. Intrinsically safe equipment must be certified by a reputable testing organization such
   as Underwriters’ Laboratories (UL). Such equipment must be used in accordance with the
   recommended environmental and operational conditions specified in the certification.
   5.4.4. If the properties of an explosive are such that the NEC requirements for electrical
   equipment provide inadequate protection under prevailing conditions, use of any of the
   following approaches is acceptable:
       5.4.4.1. Intrinsically safe equipment.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  81


       5.4.4.2. Purged or pressurized and suitably temperature-limited equipment.
       5.4.4.3. Exclusion of electrical equipment from the hazardous atmosphere.
       5.4.4.4. Isolation of equipment from the hazardous atmosphere by means of dust, vapor,
       or gas-free enclosures with surface temperatures positively maintained at safe levels.
   5.4.5. Devices which provide ―cold light‖ through chemical action are acceptable for use in
   any hazardous location.
5.5. Interior Surfaces in Class II Hazardous Locations.
   5.5.1. Interior surfaces should be smooth, free from cracks and crevices, and have joints
   taped or sealed.
   5.5.2. If painted, interior surfaces should be covered with a hard gloss paint that is easily
   cleaned.
   5.5.3. Horizontal ledges which might hold dust will be avoided or beveled to prevent dust
   collection.
   5.5.4. Cove bases at the junction of the walls and floor are recommended.
5.6. Hardware in Hazardous Locations. To reduce the risk of accidental ignition by spark,
consider the operational conditions in any hazardous location before choosing and installing
hardware. Certain hazards may be sufficient to warrant the use of materials that will reduce the
possibility of sparking.
5.7. Static Electricity in Hazardous Locations. To minimize the risk of ignition of a
flammable or combustible atmosphere in a hazardous location due to static electricity, the
requirements of Section 5E will be met for all hazardous locations.
5.8. Ventilation in Hazardous Locations. Buildings with hazardous locations must comply
with the following ventilation requirements:
   5.8.1. Buildings where dust, fumes, or vapors (having explosive potential) are formed will
   be passively ventilated, usually at the source of the hazard.
   5.8.2. Design ventilation systems so that they have adequate measures for minimizing
   (eliminating) static discharge, including measures applied during the activation of manual or
   automated ventilation systems.
   5.8.3. Equip exhaust fans through which combustible dust or flammable vapor pass with
   nonferrous blades (or casting lined with nonferrous material) and approved motors.
   5.8.4. Electrically bond and properly ground the entire ventilation system.
   5.8.5. NFPA 91, Standard for Exhaust Systems for Air Conveying of Vapors, Gases, Mists,
   and Noncombustible Particulate Solids, may be used in the installation of such systems.
   5.8.6. For buildings in which there is explosive dust, an air balance that gives a slight
   negative pressure within the building is required.
   5.8.7. If air conditioning equipment is installed, it should be done as directed in the NFPA
   90A, Standard for Installation of Air-Conditioning and Ventilating Systems, and NFPA 90B,
   Standard for Installation of Warm Air Heating and Air-Conditioning Systems. Exhaust
   systems will be cleaned thoroughly and serviced on a regular schedule. A log will be kept.

Section 5D—Electric Supply Systems

5.9. Electric Supply Systems. This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage
locations, and locations involving explosives operations which do not require explosives siting.
For QD and fire protection separation requirements between explosives facilities and electric
supply system components (see paragraph 12.84.). Electric lines serving explosives facilities,
including shielded cabling, power cabling, and communication lines will be installed
underground in metal conduit from a point at least 50 feet away from the facility.
   5.9.1. The line side of the main disconnecting switch or circuit breaker must have surge
   suppression in accordance with UFC 3-520-01, Interior Electrical Systems, and any
   Engineering Technical Letters issued specifically for explosives areas.
   5.9.2. Surge protection shall be included for all incoming conductors. The surge protection
   must include suppression at the entrance to the facility from each wire to ground. All other
   metallic utility lines and pipes must be electrically connected to the structural steel of the
   building prior to entering the facility.
5.10. Backup Power. An alternate source of power must be available for explosives operations
where the lack of a continuous power supply may cause a fire or explosion, as determined by risk
assessment (see Chapter 4).

Section 5E—Static Grounding and Bonding

5.11. Areas Requiring Static Grounding and Bonding Systems. See Section 7D for static
grounding and bonding requirements during specific operations. Static grounding and bonding
systems are required for:
   5.11.1. Hazardous locations (see Section 5C).
   5.11.2. Areas where EEDs are exposed.
   5.11.3. Areas where exposed explosives are handled.
   5.11.4. Areas where explosive components which incorporate an electrical initiating system
   are undergoing maintenance; assembly to, or disassembly from, an all-up-round (AUR)
   configuration; or electrical connection or disconnection.
   5.11.5. Areas where electrically initiated munitions and explosive devices are undergoing
   maintenance and electrical test operations and the responsible engineering function has
   determined grounding is necessary. This will usually be documented in the specific item TO
   5.11.6. Areas where explosives are loaded or unloaded on aircraft (unless exempted per
   paragraph 7.14.1 or 7.14.2).
5.12. Static Grounding and Bonding Requirements.
   5.12.1. The method generally used to eliminate or reduce the hazard from static electricity is
   to provide an electrically continuous path to ground via ground wire, cable, or strap.
       5.12.1.1. These grounds shall be one continuous ground wire, cable or strap. Short
       ground wires, cables, or straps should not be connected together to make a longer one.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    83


      5.12.1.2. Each ground wire, cable, strap shall be connected to the item and facility
      ground individually. Connecting multiple ground wires, cables, or straps to another
      ground wire, cable or strap connecting mechanism (alligator clip, clamp, etc.) should be
      avoided.
   5.12.2. Static grounding bars or other grounding devices may be appropriate for some
   operations (see paragraph 7.13.1). Such grounding bars or devices will be located at the
   entrance to or within the area where work will be performed.
   5.12.3. Wire used as a permanent static ground conductor should be large enough to
   withstand mechanical damage and must not be less than American Wire Gauge (AWG) No. 6
   (or No. 8 for existing bonds), or a braided cable of equal resistance. Wires used as static
   grounds for portable or movable equipment, or for temporary static bonding cables, will be
   large enough to carry the expected current load as specified in the item technical data, but
   will not be smaller than AWG No. 12 (3/32-inch cable).
   5.12.4. Static grounds will be bonded to the facility's grounding system. Static grounds will
   not be made to telephone grounds; electrical conduit systems; gas, steam, hot water, or air
   lines; sprinkler systems; or air terminals of lightning protection systems (connection to the
   ―down wire‖ of the system at ground level is authorized).
   5.12.5. When all of the objects are conductive, they can be grounded by electrically
   connecting all parts to a common ground conductor.
   5.12.6. Partial grounding, or using conductors that are too weak or have too much resistance,
   may increase the static hazard by providing opportunities for discharge through an
   uncontrolled path to ground.
   5.12.7. Electrical continuity may be broken by oil on bearings, paint, or rust at any contact
   point. To get a continuous circuit, grounding straps should be used to bridge such locations.
   5.12.8. Equipment in contact with conductive floors or tabletops will not be considered
   grounded.
   5.12.9. For explosive facilities, shielded cabling, power cabling, and communication lines
   must run underground in metal conduit for at least 15.24 meters (50 feet) prior to entering the
   structure. All other metallic utility lines and pipes, including steam, water, and air
   conditioning lines must be bonded to the lightning protection system just before they enter
   the building.
   5.12.10. Electrically energized objects or tools will not be placed on grounded surfaces
   where explosives operations are conducted. If electrically energized objects or tools (heat
   sealers, heat guns, etc) are required for the operation, these shall be placed on a non-
   conductive surface to prevent continuity between the electrically energized object or tool and
   the grounded surface.
5.13. Permanent Static Grounding Systems.
   5.13.1. A resistance of 25 Ohms or less is required from item connection to facility ground.
   In hazardous locations, resistance to ground of 10,000 Ohms or less for equipment static
   bonding straps is adequate to bleed off the static charges; continuity across bonds must be
   less than 1 Ohm.
 84                                                          AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   5.13.2. In accordance with AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems, all permanent static grounding
   systems shall be given a continuity test at the time of initial installation and at any time a lack
   of continuity is suspected due to damage or corrosion. A resistance reading of 25 Ohms or
   less must be obtained. Documentation of initial and recurring testing is required. Consider
   equipment (except a belt-driven machine) as a unit in testing of resistance to ground.
   5.13.3. Hazardous locations:
      5.13.3.1. Ground all conductive parts of equipment in accordance with the NEC.
      5.13.3.2. Where the installation permits viewing, make a visual inspection of all static
      bonds and grounds for breaks and corroded connections before starting operations on
      each day the equipment is to be used. Test any suspected connections and bring them up
      to required standards before starting operations.
   5.13.4. In non-hazardous locations, static bonding and grounding straps must be inspected
   visually for breaks and corroded connections quarterly in accordance with AFI 32-1065.
   Suspect connections will be tested for continuity, brought up to required standards, and re-
   tested before starting operations.
5.14. Temporary Static Grounding or Bonding Cables.
   5.14.1. Temporary static grounding or bonding cables shall be given a continuity test at the
   time of their initial placement into service.
   5.14.2. Prior to each subsequent use, the cable will be inspected for any evidence of
   corrosion or damage.
      5.14.2.1. Replace the clamp if jaws are deformed, spring is weak, or other defect is noted
      that would prevent a good connection.
      5.14.2.2. Replace the cable if more than one third of the cable strands are broken.
      Deteriorated or damaged plastic coating does not affect electrical capability of cables.
      5.14.2.3. Perform a continuity test if a lack of continuity is suspected due to damage or
      corrosion or after any components have been replaced.
   5.14.3. A resistance of 10 Ohms or less is required from inside one of the clamp jaws to
   inside the other clamp jaw.
   5.14.4. Documentation of continuity testing on temporary static grounding or bonding cables
   is not required.
5.15. Static Grounding or Bonding Reels.
   5.15.1. All installed static discharge reels shall be given a continuity test at the time of their
   initial installation.
   5.15.2. Prior to each subsequent use, the static discharge reel will be visually inspected for
   security of mounting and evidence of any corrosion or damage. Perform a continuity test if a
   lack of continuity is suspected due to damage or corrosion or after any components have
   been replaced or repaired.
   5.15.3. A resistance reading of 10 Ohms or less is required from inside the clamp jaw to the
   frame on which the reel is mounted.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      85


   5.15.4. The test will be accomplished by extending the entire length of the cable.
   5.15.5. Documentation of continuity testing on temporary static grounding or bonding cables
   is not required.
5.16. Belting. If static electricity is a hazard, use non-static-producing belting which has a
resistance to ground not exceeding 600,000 Ohms. This will include belt-driven compressors,
conveyor belts, and so forth. In measuring the total resistance to ground for belt-driven
machinery, do not count the resistance of the belting.

Section 5F—Conductive Floors

5.17. Areas Requiring Conductive Floors. Conductive floors may be required in hazardous
locations and where certain exposed explosives and materials are sensitive (easily detonated or
ignited) to the uncontrolled discharge of static electricity, and the requirements of Section 5E are
deemed inadequate to protect from the hazards of static electricity. Dust-air mixtures of
ammonium perchlorate, tetrytol, and dust of solid propellants are subject to static discharge and
conductive flooring should be considered where they are present.
5.18. Requirements for Conductive Floors.
   5.18.1. Conductive floors will be non-sparking.
   5.18.2. Conductive floors will be smooth, free from cracks, and of a type that will not
   develop surface separations, wrinkle, or buckle under operational loads.
   5.18.3. Where washing is required, conductive floors will be able to withstand repeated
   applications of hot water and cleaners.
   5.18.4. Where conductive floors are required, table tops on which exposed explosives or
   dusts are encountered shall be conductive, or covered with a conductive material, meeting the
   same requirements as the conductive floor.
   5.18.5. In small areas, conductive mats or runners can be suitable in lieu of conductive
   floors. Personnel (except electricians performing system checks), in places where conductive
   floors or coverings are required and installed, will wear conductive footwear (shoes or
   grounding straps).
   5.18.6. Where conductive floors are required, the resistance between the ground and the
   wearer will not exceed 1,000,000 Ohms; that is, the total resistance of conductive footwear
   on a person, plus the resistance of floor to ground.
5.19. Testing and Maintenance of Conductive Floors.
   5.19.1. Conductive floors will be tested when installed to ensure that design specifications
   are met, and at intervals thereafter as prescribed in AFI 32-1065. Test instruments will not
   be used until all exposed explosives and explosives dusts, gases and vapors that are subject to
   possible ignition or initiation have been removed from the area.
   5.19.2. Do not paint over conductive floors.
5.20. Testing and Maintenance of Conductive Footwear.
   5.20.1. Test conductive footwear before each shift.
 86                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   5.20.2. Conductive footwear requires care to ensure retention of its conductive properties.
       5.20.2.1. When conductive footwear is not in use, it shall be stored in lockers close to the
       room where it will be worn; conductive footwear shall be donned at this same location.
       5.20.2.2. Take precautions to prevent the accumulation of even a thin layer of dust or
       wax which can insulate conductive footwear from the floor.
       5.20.2.3. Supervisors will ensure that conductive footwear are not altered so as to negate
       their safety features.
       5.20.2.4. Only conductive materials will be used in their repair of conductive footwear.
       Conductive footwear will be cleaned thoroughly before being repaired.

Section 5G—Installed Systems and Equipment Grounds

5.21. Installed Systems and Equipment Grounds. Attention must be given to the installation
and maintenance of electrical grounding where explosives are involved.
   5.21.1. All grounding mediums must be bonded together.
   5.21.2. If the structure is equipped with a lightning protection system, all grounds, including
   static grounds, must be interconnected as outlined in AFI 32-1065.
   5.21.3. Grounding will be tested when installed to ensure that design specifications are met
   and at intervals thereafter as prescribed in AFI 32-1065. Document all tests and inspections
   on appropriate forms or automated products.
       5.21.3.1. Before making any electrical continuity and resistance tests or electrical
       repairs, remove all exposed explosives, EEDs, and explosives dust, gases and vapors that
       are subject to initiation under the specific circumstances.
       5.21.3.2. If there is an operating generator or energized transformer at the location,
       connect a shunt grounding strap before opening an installed grounding connection for
       repair or replacement.

Section 5H—Lightning Protection Systems

5.22. Facilities Requiring Lightning Protection Systems. Properly maintained lightning
protection systems (LPS) are required for all explosives facilities (to include open locations),
except as noted in paragraph 5.25. The DoD has selected the LPS criteria of NFPA 780,
Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems, for AE facilities. If LPS test
methods or designs other than prescribed in this section are used, they shall offer equivalent
protection to those prescribed in this section and be approved via the explosives site plan.
5.23. Lightning Protection System Design. Design and installation of a LPS must meet, at a
minimum, the requirements of AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems and NFPA 780. The LPS must
feature air terminals, down conductors, sideflash protection, surge suppression of data lines and
bonding of all other conductive penetrations into the protected area, and earth electrode systems.
Structural elements of the building may serve as air terminals, down conductors, or the earth
electrode. The LPS must be designed to intercept lightning at a 100 ft or less striking distance
arc in accordance with NFPA 780 (Note: The pitched roof requirements of NFPA 780 may not
be used in lieu of this requirement).
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                       87


  5.23.1. Air Terminals. An air terminal is a component of an LPS that is able to safely
  intercept lightning strikes. Air terminals may include overhead wires or grids, vertical
  spikes, or a building’s grounded structural elements. Air terminals must be capable of safely
  conducting the current from a lighting strike.
  5.23.2. Down Conductors. Down conductors (flat or round) provide low impedance paths
  from the air terminals described above to the earth electrode (ground) system. Structural
  elements having a high current capacity and a low impedance to ground need not be
  augmented with wires. Where wires are used as down conductors, these shall meet the
  requirements of NFPA 780.
  5.23.3. General Sideflash Protection. Protection from side flash is obtained either by
  bonding metallic objects to the down conductors or the earth electrode system, in accordance
  with NFPA 780, except as modified herein, or it is obtained by maintaining a separation
  distance between metallic objects and these LPS components.
     5.23.3.1. Fences and railroad tracks located within six feet of a structure’s LPS shall be
     bonded to the structure’s LPS.
     5.23.3.2. The reinforcing bars in adjacent structural elements must be joined in a manner
     to provide electrical bonding between the elements. This is an absolute requirement for
     facilities that are used to store AE. Techniques commonly used and approved in the
     construction industry to join reinforcing steel are acceptable for this purpose. The steel
     arch of an ECM must be similarly joined to the rebar in the floor.
  5.23.4. Sideflash Protection for Nuclear Weapons. The Nuclear Weapon System Safety
  Group (NWSSG) adopted a standard sideflash separation distance value of 7-feet as a
  conservative baseline for nuclear safety critical operations. In the absence of any specific
  additional guidance due to location (see paragraph 5.23.4.2) or weapon configuration (see
  Table 5.1), the 7-foot value shall be the sideflash separation distance required. When
  weapons are in an operational configuration where no lightning sideflash separation distance
  is required, all other separation distance requirements not specifically related to lightning (i.e.
  for access, ventilation, inventory, etc.) are still applicable.
     5.23.4.1. The sideflash protection requirements for all nuclear weapons, depending on
     their operational configuration, are listed in Table 5.1. The term ―major maintenance‖
     refers to the weapon configuration resulting from the disassembly or the performance of
     any maintenance operations, as currently approved, which could result in exposure of the
     weapon’s internal components to electrical energy. Major maintenance does not include
     Permissive Action Link (PAL) procedures.
     5.23.4.2. Location Considerations for Sideflash Separation Distance.
         5.23.4.2.1. If operations are being performed inside a HAS or a PAS and these
         operations include weapon configurations that require a separation distance (see
         Table 5.1), then:
             5.23.4.2.1.1. When using an LPS modified Weapons Maintenance Truck (WMT),
             no minimum sideflash separation distance is required between the WMT and the
             HAS/PAS provided all additional safety requirements are adhered to in
             accordance with TO 11N-50-1007, Transportation Maintenance System
88                                                  AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


        Operator/User Manual A/S32U-42 and A/S32U-43, including any separation
        distance requirements between the weapon and the inside walls of the WMT.
        (See paragraph 5.23.4.3 for proper application of separation distance).
        5.23.4.2.1.2. When no WMT is being used, a minimum sideflash separation
        distance of 7-feet is required between the weapon and the HAS/PAS. (See
        paragraph 5.23.4.3 for proper application of separation distance).
     5.23.4.2.2. If operations are being performed at any location other than in a HAS or a
     PAS and these operations include weapon configurations that require a separation
     distance (see Table 5.1), then a minimum sideflash separation distance of 7-feet is
     required between the weapon and facility. (See paragraph 5.23.4.3 for proper
     application of separation distance).
     5.23.4.2.3. The standard separation distance of 7-feet may be reduced by determining
     the specific sideflash separation value for a particular facility.
        5.23.4.2.3.1. Sideflash separation distance reduction shall be based on Faraday
        shield impedance characterization testing and the adequate bonding and
        appropriate installation of surge suppression using a methodology approved by
        AFSC/SEW prior to implementation.
        5.23.4.2.3.2. Documentation of the bonding and surge suppression configuration,
        including the associated separation distance calculations, in an attachment to the
        explosives site plan, must accompany the characterization test results for formal
        review and approval by AFSC/SEW before an exception to the 7-foot standard
        separation distance is granted. Changes to the bonding and surge suppression
        configuration must be submitted to AFSC/SEW for approval prior to
        implementation.
        5.23.4.2.3.3. Faraday shield characterization and implementation methodologies
        must include specific maintenance and inspection procedures. Until AFI 32-1065
        is updated to specifically address Faraday shield sideflash protection devices,
        maintenance and inspection of approved systems will comply with the following
        requirements.
            5.23.4.2.3.3.1. Bonds and surge suppressors shall be visually inspected as a
            minimum every six months to validate the installation and serviceability.
            Additionally, a visual inspection shall be performed of all surge suppression
            devices when a lightning strike occurs to the facility.
            5.23.4.2.3.3.2. Electrical resistance measurements of bonds shall be taken, as
            a minimum, once every two years. Such measurements are also required
            when the facility is subjected to an earthquake, tornado, flood, or other such
            acts of nature that could have affected the integrity of the bonds; and any time
            modification, maintenance or repair to the structure, penetration or any LPS
            component requires the bond or connection to be broken. The bond resistance
            should be less than 1 Ohm. Larger readings require tightening or reattaching
            of the bonds.
            5.23.4.2.3.3.3. Transfer impedance measurements, as determined by Faraday
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     89


                 shielding characterization testing, shall be taken, as a minimum, once every
                 ten years.
                 5.23.4.2.3.3.4. A record of all resistance or transfer impedance measurements
                 at all required points and of visual inspections shall be maintained for at least
                 six inspection and testing cycles.
             5.23.4.2.3.4. The measures taken to implement a Faraday shield approach for
             reducing the required lightning sideflash separation distance in a particular facility
             do not impact, adversely effect or relieve the requirements to maintain a
             conventional LPS as described in Section 5H and the current version of AFI 32-
             1065 (1 Oct 98).
     5.23.4.3. The required safe separation distance is properly applied to an item (weapon,
     WMT, etc.) to be protected from lightning sideflash by maintaining a minimum free
     space separation of the specified distance between the item and the facility’s walls,
     ceiling, or any other structural member capable of conducting electrical energy (e.g. steel
     columns, rebar-reinforced interior walls, columns or beams).
         5.23.4.3.1. Objects in the floor such as concrete rebar, floor grounds, and structural
         members of the Weapons Storage Vault (WSV) (when the vault is in a full down
         position) do not require the application of the sideflash separation distance.
         5.23.4.3.2. If an ungrounded metallic conductor is located within the safe separation
         distance of the item being protected, then the shortest free space distance measured
         between the metallic conductor and any structural member capable of conducting
         electrical energy shall be at least equal to the full separation distance (7’ default)
         minus the shortest free space distance measured between the metallic conductor and
         the item being protected.
         5.23.4.3.3. Transient or temporary infringement of the sideflash separation distance
         requirement (e.g. the movement of personnel through the facility or the requirement
         to use an overhead crane in the course of approved maintenance procedures) can be
         permitted. These actions shall be avoided whenever possible or their duration shall
         be minimized while still allowing required maintenance operations to be safely
         completed. These violations are not justified by issues of convenience or for the sole
         purpose of ease of operations.
     5.23.4.4. Deviations from paragraph 5.23.4 must be approved by AFSC/SEW (see
     paragraph 1.4.1)
  5.23.5. Surge Protection for Incoming Conductors. A LPS shall include surge protection
  for all incoming conductors. The surge protection must include suppression at the entrance
  to the building from each wire to ground. Shielded cabling, power cabling, and
  communication lines shall be buried underground in metal conduit for a minimum of 50 feet
  before entering the structure. All other metallic utility lines and pipes must be electrically
  connected to the LPS or the structural steel of the building just before they enter the building.
  5.23.6. Earth Electrode System. Earth electrode systems dissipate the current from a
  lightning strike to ground. Earth electrode systems may be concrete encased electrodes,
  ground loop conductors, radials, grounding rods, ground plates, a conductor immersed in
 90                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   nearby salt water, chemical grounds that are installed for the purpose of providing electrical
   contact with the earth, or combinations of these.
   5.23.7. Underground Storage Facility. An underground storage site requires protection
   against lightning only for exposed or partially exposed parts. Lightning protection
   requirements will be considered on a site specific basis.
5.24. Lightning Protection System Inspection, Maintenance, Testing, and Training. LPS
must meet, at a minimum, the requirements of AFI 32-1065 and NFPA 780. Maintenance shall
be performed to ensure that the integrity of the LPS conforms with the criteria of NFPA 780 and
AFI 32-1065.
   5.24.1. Visual inspection. The LPS will be periodically inspected as prescribed in AFI 32-
   1065.
   5.24.2. Electrical tests. The LPS shall be periodically tested electrically as specified below
   and as prescribed in AFI 32-1065.
       5.24.2.1. Bonding (resistance) tests shall be conducted periodically (or after facility
       modification that may affect bonding). A maximum resistance value of one Ohm is
       permitted across all bonds.
       5.24.2.2. Resistance to earth tests of LPS will be conducted periodically during the same
       season of the year (or after facility modification that may have affected the system). The
       maximum resistance to earth shall not exceed 25 ohms.
   5.24.3. Records and Data. Records and test measurement data of resistance to earth tests
   and bonding tests shall be kept on file for the last six inspection cycles. These records shall
   be reviewed for trend analysis as prescribed in AFI 32-1065.116
   5.24.4. Training. Personnel responsible for maintenance, inspection and testing must be
   familiar with the fundamentals described in NFPA 780 and this section as they relate to
   explosives facilities to ensure inspection and test requirements above are met. See AFI 32-
   1065 for specific training requirements.
5.25. Lightning Protection System Exceptions. Properly maintained LPS are required for
explosives facilities, with the following exceptions:
   5.25.1. Air terminal systems are not required on a HAS, a PAS, a metal aircraft shelter, or an
   earth covered magazine, provided:
       5.25.1.1. All reinforcing steel in the walls and floors are properly bonded and grounded.
       5.25.1.2. Metal ventilators at least 0.188 (3/16) inches thick are grounded.
       5.25.1.3. Metal ventilators less than 0.188 (3/16) inches thick are protected by an air
       terminal.
       5.25.1.4. Down conductor, sideflash protection, surge suppression, and earth electrode
       system requirements of paragraph 5.23 are met.
   5.25.2. A LPS is not required for licensed explosives storage locations outside the explosives
   storage area but situated in buildings primarily used for other purposes and that have
   relatively small quantities of explosives. (Note: This exemption is made because of the
   explosives; other contents of the building may require a LPS.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 91


  5.25.3. A LPS is not required for locations involving explosives operations which do not
  require explosives siting. (Note: This exemption is made because of the explosives; other
  items at this location may require a LPS.)
  5.25.4. An ―integral‖ LPS is not required for an all-metal building that has been shown to
  meet the additional criteria of a ―metallic cage‖ system, as both are defined in NFPA 780.
  This exception must be approved by AFSC/SEW prior to operational use of the building in
  this configuration (see paragraph 1.4).
  5.25.5. The following locations do not require a LPS provided that the responsible
  commander accepts the loss of resources and structure and any potential collateral damage to
  other nearby exposures. The commander’s risk acceptance must be documented by letter
  (i.e., signed by the commander stating he/she understands and accepts the potential loss of
  resources and structures at the location without LPS and any potential collateral damage to
  other nearby exposures) and this letter must be submitted with the explosives site plan.
     5.25.5.1. Explosives locations served by a local lightning warning system to permit the
     controlled termination of operations at the issuance of a Lightning Watch and immediate
     personnel protection actions at the issuance of a Lightning Warning as prescribed in
     Section 7H.
     5.25.5.2. Facilities containing only ammunition or explosives that cannot be initiated by
     lightning, as determined by AFSC/SEW and approved by DDESB, and where no fire
     hazard exists.
     5.25.5.3. Facilities where personnel are not expected to sustain injury and at the same
     time, the resulting economic loss of the structure, its contents and/or surrounding
     facilities is minimal.
     5.25.5.4. Facilities used for temporary (non-recurring) storage of munitions.
     5.25.5.5. Structures, facilities, or mobile equipment housing explosives or explosives
     operations not regularly situated at a fixed location.
     5.25.5.6. Structures and facilities limited to the storage or handling of small arms
     ammunition where the value of the ammunition is $10,000 or less.
     5.25.5.7. Lightning protection systems may be omitted on EOD intentional detonation
     and proficiency training ranges, and holding areas sited within the range boundary. A
     commander’s risk acceptance memo is not required. Apply the requirements set forth in
     paragraph 5.25.5.1.
  5.25.6. Lightning protection systems may be omitted on flightline PESs if the system
  interferes with flightline criteria contained in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning
  and Design. A commander’s risk acceptance is not required. See Section 7H for procedures
  in the event of electrical storms.
  5.25.7. Large catenary systems that cannot conform to the bonding distances calculated from
  the equations provided in AFI 32-1065 shall be considered under the provision in paragraph
  5.22. Engineering analyses shall be provided to ensure variances provide equivalent
  protection prior to submission to the DDESB for approval.
 92                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   5.25.8. ECMs that constitute a metallic cage, as defined in NFPA 780, and that do not
   contain any energized or unbounded metallic penetrations, do not require earth resistance
   testing.

Section 5I—General Design Considerations for Explosives Facilities

5.26. Blowout-type Construction. Roofs and walls of explosives facilities should be as light in
weight (weak) as practicable. Design facility features (e.g. roofs, walls, blow-out panels) to
allow venting of an internal explosion with the minimum number of large fragments. Avoid
installing hardware (including pipes and ducts) on light blowout-type walls, roofs or panels; if
unavoidable, select materials or items that will not yield heavy fragments in an explosion. The
use of frangible panels should be considered in the design of HD 1.3 facilities where high
overpressures from a detonation or a confined deflagration are expected (see HNDED-CS-93-7,
Hazard Division 1.3 Passive Structural Systems Design Guide). Exceptions to this paragraph are
made where design requirements such as the following must be met: fire walls, substantial
dividing walls, special roof loading, external overpressure protection, and specialized
manufacturing facilities. This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations,
and locations involving explosives operations which do not require explosives siting.
5.27. Non-combustible Construction. Construct exterior walls and roof coverings of
explosives building out of non-combustible materials. Non-combustible material will be used
for interior surfaces of explosives buildings (see UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for
Facilities. If it is necessary to use combustion-supporting materials in the interior of an
explosives building, treat or cover all exposed surfaces with fire-retardant material. This
paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving
explosives operations which do not require explosives siting.
5.28. Underground Explosives Storage Facilities. All wiring and electrical equipment in
underground storage facilities will, in addition to any other requirements of this chapter, be of
moisture and corrosion resistant materials and construction unless a site specific analysis
indicates that such construction is not necessary. Underground facilities must have emergency
lighting systems to provide minimum illumination in the event of a power failure.
5.29. Outdoor Explosives Storage Sites. This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives
storage locations, and locations involving explosives operations which do not require explosives
siting.
   5.29.1. Outdoor explosives storage sites will have a minimal slope, be well drained, and free
   from unnecessary combustible materials.
   5.29.2. Adequate dunnage is needed, especially between the stack and an unimproved
   surface to ensure stack stability. The dunnage, supporting timbers, or platform on which
   explosives are stored will be built and placed to prevent falling, sagging, or shifting of the
   explosives. See specific item TOs.
   5.29.3. Nonflammable or fire-resistant, waterproofed, overhead covers will be provided for
   packaged explosive items unless the item is contained in packing designed and approved for
   unprotected outside storage. There must be at least 18 inches between the top of the stack
   and the cover. If airspace is kept between the cover and the stacks, the sides of covered
   stacks may be protected by nonflammable or fire-resistant, waterproof covers.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   93


5.30. Stairways. Stairways will conform with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
(AFOSH) standards and NFPA 101, Life Safety Code requirements. Open-sided stairways in an
explosives building (or in one where a dangerous fire hazard exists) must have handrails at least
42 inches high. They must have mid-railings to preclude falls when vision might be impaired by
smoke, injury or when panic might result. Open risers should be avoided.
5.31. Fixed Ladders. Fixed ladders should conform to the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) Safety Code A14.3, Ladders – Fixed – Safety Requirements, and AFOSH
standards.
5.32. Platforms, Runways, and Railings. Platforms, runways, and railings should conform
with AFOSH requirements.
   5.32.1. Platforms and runways less than 30 feet long require one stairway or fixed ladder.
   Those over 30 feet long or more than 250 square feet in area require two stairways or ladders.
   5.32.2. Platforms, floor openings, runways, tanks, or open vats comply with AFOSH 91-501,
   Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard.
   5.32.3. Permanent railings should be of metal except in those process buildings where metal
   railings would increase the hazard.
5.33. Passageways. If weather-protected passageways (ramps) are needed between buildings or
magazines, they should have suitable fire stops between the buildings.
5.34. Walkways. Walkways at the entrances to or between adjacent operating buildings
containing explosives will be hard surfaced or boardwalks. These walkways should be kept free
from foreign material. Foot brushes, door mats, or scrapers should be provided at the entrance of
each building, except magazines. Special attention will be given to passageways, walkways, and
stairs which have been subjected to the effects of inclement weather.
5.35. Roads. This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and
locations involving explosives operations which do not require explosives siting, unless they are
located within an explosives storage area.
   5.35.1. Good all-weather roads should be provided to, and within, the explosives area.
   5.35.2. Road systems serving groups of magazines or explosives buildings will be arranged
   without dead ends so that motor vehicles carrying explosives cannot be isolated. To prevent
   dead ending, interconnecting roads for magazine service roads need only be passable trails
   adequate to accommodate the typical vehicles used at the installation.
   5.35.3. Roads serving a single magazine or explosives processing building (including its
   service facilities) may dead end at the magazine or building. The road system should be
   designed to eliminate the need for passing through an intermediate explosives area when
   traveling between one operating area and another, within the same explosives storage area.
5.36. Gates. There is no mandatory safety requirement for more than one personnel gate in the
fence around an explosives area. Weapons Safety, Security and Civil Engineering usually
determine how many gates are needed after considering all elements of the situation.
Consideration should be given to providing alternate personnel gates for a single event
emergency. This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and
 94                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


locations involving explosives operations which do not require explosives siting. Consider
alternate ways of evacuating an explosives area based on where explosives events may occur.
5.37. Drainage. Provide adequate drainage for access and internal roads and all explosives
locations. Provide magazines with condensation drainage from the storage facility interiors. This
paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving
explosives operations which do not require explosives siting.
5.38. Drains and Sumps. The following requirements apply to facilities which handle liquid
explosives or liquids containing explosive waste:
   5.38.1. When lines are required for draining liquid explosives or liquids containing explosive
   waste, they will be free of pockets and low spots. The drain line will be sloped at least one
   quarter inch per foot so that explosives will not settle in the drain line. The drain system will
   include a sump or basin so explosives can be removed.
   5.38.2. Bolted sump tanks or other types of construction that allow the explosives to settle in
   obscure or hidden spaces are prohibited. Avoid any deposition of explosives from sump
   effluent due to drying, temperature changes, or interaction with other industrial
   contamination. Use sweeping and other dry-collecting measures to keep explosives which
   are appreciably soluble in water out of the drainage system.
   5.38.3. Sumps will be designed so that suspended and solid explosive material that may
   settle cannot be carried in the wash waters beyond the sumps. They will be constructed so
   that the overflow will not disturb any floating solids. The design will allow enough settling
   time, based on the settling rate of the material and the usual rate of flow. It will allow the
   collected explosives to be removed easily and allow those which float on water to be retained
   until they can be skimmed from the water surface.
   5.38.4. In all new construction, drains between the source of explosives and the sump will be
   troughs with rounded bottoms. The drains will have removable, non-sparking, ventilated
   covers for ease of inspection for accumulated explosives. Waste liquids will not be run into
   closed drains and sewers.
   5.38.5. Drains will be inspected periodically and steps taken to prevent the buildup of
   explosive deposits. Drains and sewers containing explosive waste will not be connected to
   the normal sewage systems. All residue from hazardous material clean-up operations is
   considered hazardous waste and shall be disposed in accordance with AFI 32-7045,
   Environmental Compliance Assessment And Management Program (ECAMP) and AFPD 32-
   30, Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
5.39. Tunnels. Tunnels must be drained, ventilated, well lighted, and have at least two exits.
Water and steam service lines in tunnels will be lagged with suitable insulation. Tunnels
between buildings that contain explosives will be built to resist the shock wave and blast of an
explosion (see DoD 6055.09-M, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, for design
guidance). Only authorized personnel will enter the tunnels.
5.40. Laundries. Laundries for washing uniforms and rags that are contaminated with
explosives must comply with the following requirements:
   5.40.1. The laundry will include a safe place to store uniforms and rags that are
   contaminated with explosives before washing. Sumps will also be provided to remove
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     95


   explosives from waste water. There should be facilities available to test whether the
   contaminant (particularly any insoluble toxic substance) has been removed. Contact
   Environmental Management for assistance.
   5.40.2. Commercial businesses laundering such articles will be informed of the nature of the
   explosives contamination and possible dangerous chemical reactions.
5.41. Steam for Explosives Processing or Facility Heating. This paragraph does not apply to
licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving explosives operations which do not
require explosives siting.
   5.41.1. Steam used to heat buildings that contain explosives must not exceed 228
   o
    F. Process steam may exceed this if necessary but will not exceed 250 oF (121 C). (Process
   steam is steam that is in direct contact with explosives or which, in case of equipment failure,
   would exhaust directly into contact with explosives or explosive fumes.) However, for TNT
   specifically, the maximum temperature allowed for processing is 240 oF.
   5.41.2. Steam or hot water pipe surfaces in contact with wood, paper, or other combustible
   materials must never be hotter than 160 oF. If the hot water pipes and the steam lines are
   hotter than this, they must be covered and painted with an impervious material or otherwise
   protected against direct or prolonged contact with these items.
   5.41.3. Where a reducing valve is used, a relief valve should be installed on the low pressure
   piping. The production of superheated steam caused by the throttling action of reducing
   valves will be prevented by positive means, preferably by using a ―water leg‖ or water
   column to control steam pressure of 5 psi or less.
   5.41.4. Where close control of steam temperature is needed, indicating and recording
   pressure or temperature gauges should be installed. Such devices should be periodically
   tested and the test results recorded.
   5.41.5. Where circulating hot water is used for heating, the installation and operating
   conditions will conform to AFI 32-1068, Heating Systems And Unfired Pressure Vessels.
   5.41.6. In explosives handling or storage locations where resistance to ground is high, steam
   or hot water lines should be grounded where they enter buildings.
   5.41.7. A hot work permit is required to use any equipment exceeding 228o F in a building
   containing explosives.
5.42. Magazine Ventilation and Vermin-Resistance.
   5.42.1. Provide magazines with appropriate means of air circulation or dehumidification,
   when required by civil engineering, logistics, or health directives. (Note: Do not install
   ventilators in 3- or 7-bar rated earth-covered magazine designs unless allowed by the
   DDESB-approved definitive design drawing to ensure the ECM’s strength rating is not
   affected.
   5.42.2. Magazine vents (when installed or repaired) must prevent the entry of sparks and
   burning embers, or have fusible links to close the vents when an outside fire threatens the
   magazine. Where fusible links are installed, leave unpainted, and ensure they are
   serviceable, properly installed, and rated for a maximum temperature of 155o F to 165o F
   (68.3o C to 73.8o C) NSN 4210-00-033-6032 or suitable substitute. Existing magazine vents

   that do not prevent the entry of sparks and burning embers may continue to be used until
   repaired or replaced; however, it is strongly recommended that these vents be evaluated by
   civil engineering (base fire marshal or designate) for their ability to prevent the entry of
   sparks and burning embers.
   5.42.3. Provide magazines with vermin resistance, when required by civil engineering,
   logistics, or health directives.

Section 5J—Emergency Exits for Explosives Buildings

5.43. General. Use the ANSI Safety Code A156.3, Building Exits, and NFPA 101 as a guide in
constructing emergency exits and fire escapes.
   5.43.1. Exterior fire escapes from a building with two or more stories must be of non-
   combustible material. They should be separated from the interior of the building by fire-
   resistant walls.
   5.43.2. Fire escape stairs will be arranged so they are exposed to the smallest number of
   window and door openings. All openings will be protected as required by the NFPA 101.
   5.43.3. Fire walls are designed to limit the spread of fire to only one zone of a facility. They
   are normally extended through the roof of the building to prevent a fire on one side of the fire
   wall from immediately spreading to the remainder of the facility. Construct proposed fire
   walls as prescribed in UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities. Protect any
   openings through the fire wall as described in the NFPA 80, Standard for Fire Doors and
   Other Opening Protectives, and NFPA 221, Standard for Fire Walls and Fire Barrier Walls.
5.44. Building Exits.
   5.44.1. One properly located exit is suitable for small operating rooms or cubicles which
   have substantial dividing walls on three sides.
   5.44.2. In larger buildings or rooms, at least two exits remote from each other (regardless of
   dimensions), will be provided for each operating room or building containing explosives.
   5.44.3. If more than eight persons are occupying a room containing explosives, it should
   have more than one exit or one exit for each multiple of five persons (or fraction thereof).
   Coordinate with the installation’s Ground Safety (SEG) and Fire Marshall for the number of
   exits required based on occupancy.
   5.44.4. Exits shall be at least 32 inches wide by 80 inches high. However, in determining
   the total number of exits required, available space (in multiples of 32 inches of width) may
   be considered additional exit units. Exits should be spaced equally about the perimeter of the
   building. Refer to NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, paragraph 7.2.1.2.3.2, for exceptions to the
   32 inch width.
   5.44.5. Exits shall be in accordance with NFPA 101. Exits should lead directly outside.
   Plan each exit to avoid obstructing the escape of personnel. Do not place explosives,
   equipment, and operating materials between personnel and exits.
5.45. Exit Doors.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    97


   5.45.1. ECM doors are not authorized for new construction projects used as operating
   locations or for existing ECMs converted to use as operating locations. Existing operating
   locations using ECM doors may be grandfathered if the ESP has been formerly approved by
   the DDESB or AFSC.
   5.45.2. Exit doors in operating buildings will open outward.
   5.45.3. During operating hours, exit doors may be fastened with dead-bolt panic hardware
   that cannot be operated from the outside.
   5.45.4. Exit doors shall never be less than 32 inches (refer to NFPA 101, Life Safety Code,
   paragraph 7.2.1.2.4 for exceptions to the 32 inch width) by 80 inches high.
   5.45.5. Do not obstruct exit doors or departure routes.
   5.45.6. Exit doors should be panel or flush surface type construction except for existing
   storage magazines already approved by AFSC or DDESB.
   5.45.7. Vision panels in each door are desirable. The using agency may omit them for
   security. Vision panels should be in the upper half of the door, not exceed 100 square inches,
   and glazed with acrylic plastic or equivalent material. They should be of shatter resistant,
   non-combustible material or slow-burning material of a type that is practically smokeless.
   The requirements of Section 5B do not apply to vision panels in exit doors.
5.46. Safety Chutes. Safety chutes will be provided as exits from multistory hazardous
locations where rapid egress is vital and cannot be otherwise provided.
   5.46.1. Supporting members for safety chutes should be made of non-combustible materials
   and anchored to structural members designed to provide resistance to the effects of an
   explosion or fire.
   5.46.2. These chutes must be provided for work levels above the ground floor. They should
   be placed on opposite sides of the operation (so that people will not be trapped by a fire
   between them and a single chute).
   5.46.3. Exits to safety chutes will open on a platform at least 3 feet square, equipped with
   guardrails. The chutes will begin at the outside edge of the platform.
   5.46.4. Landings from safety chutes should be located where escape routes will be free from
   tripping hazards, low guy lines, drains, ditches, or other obstructions.
   5.46.5. A manual or automatic tripping device should be installed at or near the entrance to
   chutes to give an alarm in the operating building and nearby structures. This tripping device
   may also actuate deluge valves and water curtains in the building or room affected.
   5.46.6. Recommended safety chute dimensions and construction are: angle, 40-50 degrees
   with the horizontal; depth of chute, 24 inches; radius at bottom of chute, 12 inches. The
   lower end of the chute will not be over 24 inches above the ground. It will have enough of a
   horizontal run to prevent an injury to the employee because of the rate of fall (induced speed)
   during the exit.
      5.46.6.1. Chutes 40 feet long require 6 feet of horizontal run.
      5.46.6.2. The juncture of sections will be well-rounded and must overlap in the direction
      of travel.

Section 5K—Explosive Dust Collection Systems

5.47. Vacuum Collection. Vacuum (aspirator) systems with a wet-type collector that moistens
explosive dust close to the point of origin and keeps it wet until the dust is removed for disposal
are preferred. However, some dusts, (e.g., Explosive D) should be collected in a dry-type
system.
   5.47.1. Vacuum systems must be arranged so each type of explosive is collected separately
   or so dissimilar hazards (for example, black powder with lead azide) are not mixed.
   5.47.2. Provision should be made for the proper liberation of gases that may be formed in a
   vacuum system.
   5.47.3. Vacuum systems used to collect more sensitive explosives (such as black powder,
   lead azide, mercury fulminate, tracer, igniter, incendiary compositions, and pyrotechnic
   materials) should be used only for operations with fuzes, detonators, small arms ammunition,
   and black powder igniters. Wet-type collectors are required, with a compatible wetting agent
   close to the point of intake.
5.48. Location of Dry-Type Collection Chambers.
   5.48.1. Stationary dry-type collection chambers should be located outside of operating
   buildings, in the open or in a separate building used exclusively for collection chamber.
       5.48.1.1. There must be a protective barrier [e.g. operational shield, barricade, SDW]
       between the operating building and the outside location or separate building where the
       vacuum collection chamber is placed.
       5.48.1.1.1. If the chamber contains 25 pounds of explosives or less, the protective barrier
       will be located at least 8 feet from the operating building.
       5.48.1.2. If the chamber contains more than 25 pounds of explosives, the protective
       barrier will be separated from the operating building by a minimum of intraline distance
       based on the quantity of explosives in the chamber.
       5.48.1.3. When it is not practicable to locate dry-type vacuum collection chambers
       outside the operating building, a separate room within the building may be set aside for
       the purpose. This room must not contain other operations and never be used as a
       communicating corridor or passageway between other operating locations within the
       building when explosives are being collected. If more than one collection chamber is to
       be placed in the room, the room will be subdivided into cubicles separated by SDWs.
       Not more than one collection chamber will be in a single cubicle.
   5.48.2. Portable dry-type vacuum collectors will not be placed in a bay or cubicle where
   explosives are present. If they do not contain more than five pounds of explosives, they may
   be placed outside the building or in a separate cubicle with SDWs. If they contain more than
   five pounds, the requirement for stationary collectors will be met.
5.49. Location of Wet-Type Collection Chambers. If stationary and portable wet-type
collection chambers do not contain more than five pounds of explosives, they may be placed in
operating bays or cubicles. If placed in separate cubicles, the limits for each one may be 15
pounds. If they contain more than 15 pounds, the location requirements for dry-type collectors
will apply.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    99


5.50. Design and Operation of Collection Systems.
   5.50.1. The entire system will be electrically grounded and the grounds tested semiannually.
   5.50.2. The system will be designed so that metal parts do not pinch explosives or explosive
   dusts.
   5.50.3. Pipes or tubes through which the dust travels should have flanged, welded, or rubber
   connections. Threaded connections are not allowed.
   5.50.4. The system will be designed to reduce accumulation of explosive dust in parts other
   than the collection chamber.
   5.50.5. Long radius turns (centerline radius at least four times the diameter of the duct) will
   be used in the duct work.
   5.50.6. The number of points of application of vacuum should be kept to a minimum.
   5.50.7. Each room requiring vacuum collection should have a separate exhaust line to the
   primary collection chamber. No more than two bays will be serviced by a common leader to
   the primary collection chamber.
   5.50.8. The vacuum line should be as short as possible from points of application of vacuum
   to the wet collectors.
   5.50.9. The number of wet primary collectors serviced by a single secondary collector
   should be kept at a minimum. Not more than two dry primary collectors should be connected
   to a single secondary collector (wet or dry-type).
   5.50.10. If an operation does not create an airborne concentration of dust, a manually
   operated suction hose to remove explosive dust is preferred.
   5.50.11. Manually operated hoses should not be connected to explosive dust-producing
   machines. A permanent attachment increases the risk of propagation through the collection
   system should a detonation occur at the dust-producing machine.
   5.50.12. In dry vacuum collection systems, two collection chambers should be installed in
   series, ahead of the pump or exhaust.
   5.50.13. Wet collectors must provide for immersion of explosives to break up air bubbles, to
   release airborne particles, and to remove airborne moisture before it leaves the collector.
   This will keep moistened particles of explosives from entering the small piping between the
   collector and the exhaust or pump.
   5.50.14. Explosive dust will be removed from the collection chamber at least once each shift
   to eliminate unnecessary and hazardous concentrations of explosives. The entire system
   should be cleaned weekly, dismantling the parts if necessary.

Section 5L—Water Supply and Fire Suppression Systems for Explosives Facilities

5.51. Water Supply for Explosives Manufacturing Areas and Loading Plants. An outside,
underground, looped system of mains should be installed. The water distribution system will
meet the requirements of UFC 3-600-01 and the NFPA 1142, Standard on Water Supplies for
Suburban and Rural Fire Fighting. Mains will be valved properly and will not extend under
explosives locations.
 100                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


5.52. Automatic Sprinkler Systems.
   5.52.1. Certain buildings in explosives manufacturing, surveillance, and inspection or
   ammunition workshop areas (for example, the receiving building in a load line) may require
   automatic sprinkler systems. The proper system must be determined by engineering studies
   of the hazards involved. Each system must be equipped with an audible warning device to
   alert personnel. Sprinkler systems in each building must be connected into the central alarm
   location. Sprinkler systems will be installed as prescribed in UFC 3-600-01.
   5.52.2. When explosives facilities are placarded for ―Apply No Water‖, automatic sprinkler
   systems will only be disabled after a risk assessment has been accomplished/approved by the
   local fire chief. If the risk assessment indicates the continued use of the automatic system is
   appropriate (e.g. to keep a potential fire from reaching the explosives items), the presence of
   the ―Apply No Water‖ and an operable automatic sprinkler system does not constitute a
   violation of this standard. In all cases, the audible warning device must remain operable.
5.53. Deluge Systems. Machinery or operations in which there is a process fire hazard will
have an auto deluge system as required by an engineering study.
   5.53.1. Quick-acting sensors such as ultraviolet detectors will be used. In addition, hand-
   operated, quick-acting deluge control equipment should be provided.
   5.53.2. Control devices used should be actuated by rate of rise, fixed temperature, or their
   combination, as appropriate. If the system contains electrical components, the controls will
   be placed in enclosures approved by the NEC.
   5.53.3. Deluge systems should be charged with steam, water, or chemicals. This depends on
   the expected character of the fire to be controlled, as determined by engineering studies of
   the hazards and NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, and NFPA 16,
   Standard for the Installation of Foam-Water Sprinkler and Foam-Water Spray Systems.
   5.53.4. If there are two or more deluge systems in the same fire area, supply mains and the
   arrangements and size of the system riser will provide each system with the required
   quantities of water per head.
   5.53.5. A device will be installed on the supply side of the system so that it will actuate an
   audible warning device in affected operating areas when the pressure fails.
   5.53.6. Operations protected by a deluge system should be stopped immediately if the
   system fails and should not be resumed until adequate protection is provided.

Section 5M—Monitoring of Design and Construction of Explosives Facilities

5.54. Monitoring of Design of Explosives Facilities. Weapons Safety and Civil Engineering
shall jointly ensure the design requirements of this chapter, and Chapters 4 and 6, are properly
incorporated into design specifications (to include the statement of work when design and
construction effort is being contracted) and as-built drawings for new explosives facilities.
Additionally, those requirements that apply to nuclear weapon storage, maintenance, and
handling facilities as defined in AFMAN 91-118, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for
Nuclear Weapon Systems, must also be addressed in construction planning of new facilities for
these purposes.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 101


5.55. Monitoring of Construction of Explosives Facilities. In regards to the actual
construction of explosives facilities, Weapons Safety and Civil Engineering shall jointly:
   5.55.1. Ensure compliance with the final approved construction drawings with regard to
   design requirements driven by explosives safety considerations.
   5.55.2. Ensure any changes that affect explosives safety considerations are reflected on the
   as-built drawings and the explosives site plan updated if necessary.
   5.55.3. Ensure that the actual construction location of sited explosives facilities complies
   with the approved explosives site plan.
   5.55.4. Ensure temporary construction workers are provided protection from explosives in
   nearby facilities as required in paragraph 12.17.11.
   5.55.5. Ensure explosives in nearby facilities are protected from temporary construction
   operations. Consideration should be given to fire hazards and radio frequency (RF) hazards.

Section 5N—Maintenance and Repair of Explosives Facilities and Equipment

5.56. Removal of Explosives. Supervisory and weapons safety personnel will determine, based
on a risk assessment (see Chapter 4), whether explosives must be removed prior to performing
maintenance and repair of explosives facilities, or maintenance and repair of equipment in
explosives facilities.
   5.56.1. Only perform maintenance and repair in the interior of an ECM that contains bulk
   explosives if the explosives are physically protected and a risk assessment (see Chapter 4)
   shows that hazards to the explosives can be adequately controlled.
   5.56.2. Because electricians are not allowed to work on live electrical equipment while
   wearing conductive shoes, remove all explosives from areas with conductive floors before
   proceeding with the electrical work.
5.57. Requirements for Maintenance and Repair With Explosives Present.
   5.57.1. Brief maintenance personnel on the hazards involved and precautions needed to
   perform the work safely, and actions to take in the event of an accident. This includes self-
   help projects.
   5.57.2. If hazards warrant, trained weapons safety personnel must monitor repair activities
   for safety. The monitor will halt repair activities when, in his or her opinion, hazards are
   being created. The senior supervisor of the facility will resolve the problem before resuming
   operations.
   5.57.3. Keep the floor clean and free of extraneous materials and equipment in the
   immediate work area.
   5.57.4. Hot Work.
       5.57.4.1. Don't use flame or heat-producing equipment inside the facility unless facility
       contents are protected from the flame, sparks and heat by physical separation or
       shielding.
 102                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       5.57.4.2. Keep flame or heat-producing equipment used outside the facility as far as
       practicable from all explosives (to include explosives in nearby facilities). When needed,
       use baffles and screens to confine sparks and flames.
       5.57.4.3. Meet applicable requirements of AFOSH Standard 91-5, Welding, Cutting, and
       Brazing.
       5.57.4.4. Notify the fire department before work begins.
   5.57.5. Maintenance personnel must wear conductive footwear in areas with conductive
   floors.
   5.57.6. Ensure RF hazards presented by maintenance and repair operations are evaluated and
   controlled in accordance with Chapter 9.
5.58. Maintenance of Explosives Facilities.
   5.58.1. Annually check the depth of the earth cover on ECMs to ensure it is at least 2 feet.
   MAJCOMs may require more frequent inspections based on environmental conditions.
   ECMs with a suitable material finish (e.g., geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) do not require a depth
   check as long as there are no signs of the earth cover washing out from underneath the
   suitable material. If the earth cover erodes to less than 2 feet, repair as soon as practical (not
   to exceed 90 days) or classify as an above-ground magazine (Note: Barricaded above-
   ground magazine criteria may be used if the remaining earth cover meets the barricade
   criteria of Section 6E).
   5.58.2. Periodically check ventilators to ensure they function properly. Ventilators may be
   closed where blowing snow or humid air would increase condensation. They may also be
   closed to protect supplies from blowing sand. Set up controls to make sure heat does not
   build up within the storage space.
   5.58.3. Periodically check fusible links to ensure they are unpainted, serviceable, properly
   installed, and temperature-rated per paragraph 5.42.2.
5.59. Maintenance and Repair in Hazardous Locations. Before beginning maintenance and
repair in a hazardous location, a weapons safety representative will ensure the area is inspected
for the presence of explosives residue. Maintenance personnel must provide for the removal of
all hazardous materials, to include removal of all explosive residue material from equipment,
crevices beneath floors, within walls and pipes, and under fittings where explosives may have
collected. The area should be washed down thoroughly.
5.60. Maintenance and Repair of Hazardous Location Equipment and Electrical
Installations. Extraordinary care will be taken in the maintenance and repair of equipment and
electrical installations in hazardous locations.
   5.60.1. Equipment and electrical installations must be periodically inspected and maintained
   by qualified personnel, with a written record kept of the inspections and maintenance. Where
   inspection frequency is not prescribed in a TO, technical manual (TM), or other directive, the
   inspection period will be decided by the local fire chief on the basis of the existing situation.
   5.60.2. Before repairs are allowed on any equipment or electrical installation that has been
   exposed to explosive residue contamination, clean the equipment and tag it. The operating
   supervisor must sign the tag, certifying that all explosives have been removed. If it has been
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                            103


   impossible to clean some part, note this on the tag, together with clear instructions to
   maintenance personnel on how to handle it safely.
5.61. Maintenance and Repair of Electrical Equipment. Only qualified persons are
authorized to maintain and repair electrical equipment. Where the equipment may have been
exposed to contamination from explosives, the explosives will be removed or neutralized before
repairs are started.
5.62. Post-Maintenance and Repair of Explosives Facilities and Equipment.
   5.62.1. Inspect the facility after completion of the work to ensure it is safe for resumption of
   explosives storage or operations.
   5.62.2. Examine and test newly repaired equipment to ensure its safe operating condition
   before resuming use of the equipment.

                                            Chapter 6

PROTECTIVE CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIFIC EXPLOSIVES FACILITY DESIGNS

Section 6A—Introduction

6.1. General. This chapter contains standards for construction of earth-covered magazines
(ECM), barricaded open storage modules, barricades, ARMCO revetments, substantial dividing
walls, firewalls, and multicube or segregated magazines. Facilities constructed per this chapter:
   6.1.1. Are permitted to use reduced separation distance criteria as shown in Chapter 12.
   6.1.2. Must meet all the other design criteria of Chapter 5.
6.2. Above Ground Magazines. There are no construction criteria for AGMs other than the
electrical and LPS design criteria in Chapter 5.
6.3. Special Structures. The DDESB has approved reduced NEWQD and reduced QD for
AGM and containers listed in DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction. Use and siting
of these AGM and containers must meet all conditions or restrictions specified in the design and
approval documentation as described in the referenced document.
6.4. High Performance Magazines and Underground Explosives Facilities. See DoD
6055.09-M, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, for information on High
Performance Magazines and underground explosives facilities.

Section 6B—Protective Construction

6.5. Purpose of Protective Construction. Construction features and location are important
safety considerations when planning facilities. Potential explosions’ effects may be altered
significantly by construction features that limit the amount of explosives involved, attenuate
blast overpressure or thermal radiation, and reduce the quantity and range of hazardous
fragments and debris. (Note: Proper location of ES in relation to PES helps minimize
unacceptable damage and injuries in the event of an incident.) The major objectives in facility
planning will be to:
   6.5.1. Protect against explosion propagation between adjacent bays or buildings and protect
   personnel against death or serious injury from incidents in adjacent bays or buildings. The
   construction of separate buildings to limit explosion propagation, rather than the use of either
   protective construction or separation of explosives within a single building, shall be
   considered when safety would be greatly enhanced or cost would be significantly reduced.
   6.5.2. Protect assets, when warranted.
6.6. Requirements for Use of Protective Construction. Hardening an ES or constructing a
PES to suppress explosion effects and provide an appropriate degree of protection may allow a
reduction of the separation distances required by QD tables.
   6.6.1. Design of explosion resistant facilities shall be accomplished by an organization or
   individual experienced in the field of structural dynamics using design procedures accepted
   by professionals in the field. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-340-02, Structures to Resist
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                105


  the Effects of Accidental Explosions, (formally known as TM-5-1300), is an appropriate
  source of effects data and design methods.
  6.6.2. Existing, Approved Protective Construction Designs. DDESB TP 15 documents
  previously approved protective construction designs. Explosives site plan submissions
  utilizing approved protective construction designs shall:
     6.6.2.1. Reference the DDESB approval memorandum.
     6.6.2.2. Identify the design or drawing numbers used, if available.
     6.6.2.3. Specify that the protective construction will be used in the same manner as that
     stated in the referenced in the DDESB approval memorandum.
     6.6.2.4. State that the structural design has not been altered in any manner that impacts
     the design’s integrity or its ability to provide the required level of protection.
     6.6.2.5. State that the site specific adaptations of the design have been reviewed and are
     appropriate for the site conditions.
  6.6.3. Modifications to Previously Approved Protective Construction Designs. For a
  protective construction design previously approved by the DDESB, where a structural aspect
  of the protective design has been modified by a structural engineer with experience in
  designing blast resistant structures, the submitting MAJCOM shall provide:
     6.6.3.1. A complete description of the structural modifications made, the reasons for the
     modifications, and any explosives safety impact resulting from the modifications.
     6.6.3.2. The basis of design and the explosives safety protection being afforded by the
     modified design.
     6.6.3.3. The following protective construction design and MAJCOM review data:
         6.6.3.3.1. For preliminary DDESB approval, concept structural design drawings that
         are at least 35 percent complete. For final DDESB approval, the structural design
         drawings must be at least 60 percent complete, with all protective construction design
         modifications sufficiently developed for validation.
         6.6.3.3.2. Design calculations for all critical structural elements.
         6.6.3.3.3. All applicable electrical, grounding, and LPS details.
         6.6.3.3.4. Supporting blast analyses, experimental data reports, blast design
         calculations, and other technical information. Blast analysis and design calculations
         must satisfy UFC 3-340-02 requirements.
         6.6.3.3.5. A memorandum from the submitting MAJCOM civil engineering office
         verifying that the protective construction design modifications comply with DoD
         6055.09-M and UFC 3-340-02 requirements. This verification will be based upon a
         quality control review (unless a more detailed independent technical review is
         warranted based upon either the lack of experience by the designer or the use of a
         new, unvalidated blast analysis or design approach) by a competent DoD blast design
         agency such as the Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NAVFAC ESC) or
         the US Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (USAESCH).
             AFSC/SEWC will provide appropriate contact information upon request.

          Because both of these organizations operate on a cost reimbursable basis, projects
          must arrange payment for these organization’s services.
   6.6.4. New Protective Construction Designs. For a new protective construction design, the
   submitting MAJCOM shall provide:
       6.6.4.1. The criteria being met; a complete description of both the design’s capabilities
       and the basis for the design, and the level of explosives safety protection level it affords.
       6.6.4.2. The following protective construction design and MAJCOM review data:
          6.6.4.2.1. For preliminary DDESB approval, concept structural design drawings that
          are at least 35 percent complete. For final DDESB approval, the structural design
          drawings must be at least 60 percent complete, with all protective construction design
          modifications sufficiently developed for validation.
          6.6.4.2.2. Design calculations for all critical structural elements.
          6.6.4.2.3. All applicable electrical, grounding, and LPS details.
          6.6.4.2.4. Supporting blast analyses, experimental data reports, blast design
          calculations, and other technical information. Blast analysis and design calculations
          must satisfy       UFC 3-340-02 requirements.
          6.6.4.2.5. A memorandum from the submitting MAJCOM civil engineering office
          verifying that the protective construction design complies with DoD 6055.09-M and
          UFC 3-340-02 requirements. This verification will be based upon a quality control
          review (unless a more detailed independent technical review is warranted based upon
          either the lack of experience by the designer or the use of a new, unvalidated blast
          analysis or design approach) by a competent DoD blast design agency such as the
          Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NAVFAC ESC) or the US Army
          Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (USAESCH). AFSC/SEWC will provide
          appropriate contact information upon request. Because both of these organizations
          operate on a cost reimbursable basis, projects must arrange payment for these
          organization’s services.
       6.6.4.3. Once approved, a standard protective construction design can be site-adapted,
       provided the conditions and limitations of the DDESB approval are met. The DDESB
       will document new standard approved protective construction designs in DDESB TP
       15.

Section 6C—Earth-Covered Magazines

6.7. Earth-Covered Magazines. An ECM's primary purpose is to protect AE. To qualify for
the default IMD in Table 12.1, an ECM, acting as an ES, must not collapse. Although
substantial permanent deformation of the ECM may occur, sufficient space should be provided to
prevent the deformed structure or its doors from striking the contents.
6.8. Earth-Covered Magazine NEWQD Limits. ECMs may be approved for storage of up to
500,000 lbs NEWQD of HD 1.1 in accordance with paragraph 12.6.1.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     107


6.9. Earth-Covered Magazine Design Load Criteria. ECMs must be designed to withstand
the following: (Note: Undefined ECMs must meet the criteria of paragraphs 6.9.1 through 6.9.3
only.)
   6.9.1. Conventional (e.g., live, dead, snow) loads for the barrel of an arch-shaped ECM.
   6.9.2. Conventional (e.g., live, dead, snow) and blast-induced loads for the roof of a flat-
   roofed ECM.
   6.9.3. Conventional (e.g., live, dead, snow) loads for the rear wall of an arch-shaped ECM
   and for the rear and side walls of a flat-roofed ECM.
   6.9.4. Expected blast loads, as applicable:
       6.9.4.1. On the head wall and door of 3-Bar ES ECM is a triangular pulse with peak
       overpressure of 43.5 psi and impulse of 11.3W1/3 psi-ms.
       6.9.4.2. On the head wall and door of 7-Bar ES ECM is a triangular pulse with peak
       overpressure of 101.5 psi and impulse of 13.9W1/3 psi-ms.
       6.9.4.3. On the roof of a flat-roofed ES ECM is a triangular pulse with peak overpressure
       of 108 psi and impulse of 19W1/3 psi-ms.
6.10. Earth-Covered Magazine Earth Cover Criteria.
   6.10.1. Earth cover will be reasonably cohesive and free from harmful (toxic) matter, trash,
   debris, and stones heavier than ten pounds or larger than six inches in diameter. Solid or wet
   clay or similar types of soil will not be used as earth cover because they are too cohesive.
   The larger of acceptable stones shall be limited to the lower center of fills and shall not be
   used for earth cover over magazines. The earthen material will be compacted and prepared,
   as necessary, for structural integrity and erosion control.
   6.10.2. If it is impossible to use a cohesive material (e.g., in sandy soil), or where vegetation
   growth is ineffective in preventing erosion, the earth cover over ECM will be finished with 2-
   3 inches of a suitable material (e.g., geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) that will not produce
   hazardous debris, but will ensure structural integrity. The important consideration for these
   materials is that they pulverize in the event of an accidental explosion. A mixture combined
   with straw, bark, or comparable material would be suitable. Wire mesh may be used in the
   finishing material. Aggregate may not be added to the finishing material. Consider means of
   validating earth cover depth as part of the design of the finishing material. Reference TM 5-
   630, Natural Resources and Land Management, for further information.
   6.10.3. Select vegetation for ECM so that their weight or root system will not damage the
   structure.
   6.10.4. The earth fill or earth cover between ECM may be either solid or sloped. A
   minimum of 2 ft of earth cover will be maintained over the top of each ECM. (Note: If the
   specified thickness and slope of earth on the ECM is not maintained, the ECM must be sited
   as an AGM. Barricaded AGM criteria may be used if the remaining earth cover meets the
   barricade criteria of Section 6E.)
   6.10.5. See paragraph 5.58.1 for maintenance of earth cover on ECMs.
6.11. Earth-Covered Magazine Drawings.
 108                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       6.11.1. DDESB TP 15 provides listings of the various types of ECM that have been
       constructed over the years and identifies their structural strength designator (i.e. 7-Bar, 3-
       Bar, or Undefined). This reference also lists the 7-Bar and 3-Bar ECM designs that are
       currently approved for new construction.
   6.11.2. If an ECM's drawing number or numbers are not listed in DDESB TP 15 it will be
   treated as an Undefined ECM, until a structural analysis is performed to show that the ECM
   qualifies for another structural strength designation, or support documentation is provided to
   prove the ECM had been approved by the DDESB with a different structural strength
   designation.
   6.11.3. For existing, arch-shaped Undefined ECM, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers
   (USACE) Report HNDED-CS-S-95-01, Guide For Evaluating Blast Resistance Of
   Nonstandard Magazines, may be used to determine if an Undefined ECM could qualify as a
   7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM.
   6.11.4. DDESB approval is required prior to any change in an ECM's structural strength
   designator.
   6.11.5. Certain ECMs have been approved with reduced NEWQD and reduced QD and these
   are also listed in DDESB TP 15. Use of these ECMs requires that their use and siting meet
   all conditions and restrictions specified in the design and approval documentation, as
   described in the referenced document.
   6.11.6. New construction of previously DDESB-approved 7-Bar and 3-Bar ECM must meet
   the minimum requirements of the current revisions of the approved drawings.

Section 6D—Barricaded Open Storage Modules

6.12. Barricaded Open Storage Modules. Modules allow the same amount of explosives to be
stored using far less land space. However, in the event of an unplanned detonation in a cell, AE
in an adjacent cell will be covered with earth and unavailable for use until extensive uncovering
operations and possibly maintenance are completed. To reduce the MCE expected from an
explosion in one cell, buffered storage arrangements may be used as described in paragraph
12.71.
6.13. Barricaded Open Storage Modules NEWQD and AE Type Limits.
   6.13.1. The maximum NEWQD permitted to be stored within each cell is 250,000 lbs.
   Normal mixing rules (see paragraph 12.7) apply. HD 1.4 is not additive to the NEWQD.
   6.13.2. Storage will be limited to AE that will not promptly propagate explosions or mass
   fire between modules, and that are not susceptible to firebrands and fireballs. These
   restrictions allow storage at K1.1 separation. Intermagazine (IM) distance for HD 1.2.x. and
   1.4 for module to module separation is based on total NEWQD. MCE and Largest Single
   Round Net Explosive Weight for Quantity Distance (LSRN) are not used to calculate IM
   distance between modules. Only the following AE are approved for modular storage:
       6.13.2.1. HE bombs (fuzed or unfuzed, with or without fins), and similarly cased HD 1.1
       AE when stored on nonflammable pallets.
       6.13.2.2. The below items when contained in nonflammable shipping containers:
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  109


          6.13.2.2.1. 30 mm and smaller AE.
          6.13.2.2.2. CBU.
          6.13.2.2.3. Inert AE components.
          6.13.2.2.4. HD 1.4 AE.
   6.13.3. Module storage of AE items in flammable outer-packaging configurations will be
   minimized. AE items in flammable outer packaging configurations must be covered with fire
   retardant material. Combustible dunnage or other flammable material will not be stored
   either in, or within, 100 ft of modules.
   6.13.4. When fire retardant materials are used to cover AE items stored in modules,
   ventilation will be provided between the covers and the stored AE items to minimize the
   effects of solar heating upon the stored AE.
   6.13.5. AE stored in each module will be limited to one type of item, unless the
   MAJCOM/SEW authorizes mixed storage. Mixed storage of high explosive (HE) bombs and
   CBUs presents an extreme fragment hazard and should be avoided.
6.14. Barricaded Open Storage Module Design Criteria.
   6.14.1. As depicted in Figure 6.1, a module is a barricaded area composed of a series of
   connected cells with hard surface (e.g., concrete, packed earth, engineered materials, etc.)
   storage pads separated from each other by barricades.
   6.14.2. The only restriction on the arrangement of cells within a module and of groups of
   modules is that cell openings may not face each other, unless they are either barricaded or
   meet QD criteria for an unbarricaded AGM (see Table 12.1).
   6.14.3. Although a light metal shed or other lightweight fire retardant cover may be used for
   weather protection for individual cells, heavy structures (e.g., reinforced concrete, dense
   masonry units) or flammable material will not be used.
   6.14.4. Table 6.1 provides the minimum pad sizes necessary to store the NEWQD indicated.
   The pad's size may need to be adjusted to accommodate specific AE. This adjustment will
   impact the required barricade height (see Table 6.1, Note 3).
   6.14.5. Barricade requirements:
      6.14.5.1. All barricades used in forming the module will meet the requirements in
      Section 6E. The width or length of the stack of AE (controlled by the pad size of the cell)
      and the distances between the stack and the top of the barricade influences the minimum
      barricade height requirement. The heights listed in Table 6.1 are the minimum
      requirement for barricade locations. These minimum heights are based upon both the
      storage pad sizes and the separations shown. When feasible, barricade heights shall be
      increased (see paragraph 6.16.2).
      6.14.5.2. The centerlines of barricades between cells of the module will be located at a
      point halfway between adjacent AE storage pads. Back and end (outside) barricades will
      be located at the same distance from the pads as those between the cells.
 110                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       6.14.5.3. When selecting a site for a module, maximum advantage should be taken of
       natural topographical barriers. When used, natural barriers will provide the same level of
       protection as the barricade shown in Figure 6.1.

Section 6E—Barricades

6.15. Barricades.
   6.15.1. Properly constructed and sited barricades, and undisturbed natural earth have
   explosives safety applications for protecting against low-angle fragments. Barricades
   provide no protection against high-angle fragments or lobbed AE; some of these high-angle
   fragments may travel to the outer limits of protection areas set up for PTR and inhabited
   building (IB) distances. If the barricade is destroyed in the process of providing protection,
   then secondary fragments from the destroyed barricade must also be considered as part of a
   hazards analysis.
   6.15.2. To reduce hazards from high-velocity, low-angle fragments, the barricade must be
   placed between the PES and the ES so that the fragments of concern impact the barricade
   before the ES. The barricade must both be thick enough so that it reduces fragment
   velocities to acceptable levels and high enough so that it intercepts the ballistic trajectories of
   the fragments of concern.
   6.15.3. A barricade must interrupt all direct lines of sight between the ES and PES, and, in
   addition, meet the height and length requirements per paragraphs 6.16. and 6.17.
   respectively.
   6.15.4. Barricades around the exposed site can be used to reduce minimum separations
   required by Table 12.1 or fragment distances from 1.2 munitions if tests or engineering
   analysis show the barrier will stop the low-angle, high-velocity fragments and the building
   will provide protection from the high-angle fragments that can be expected from the PES.
   The distance cannot be reduced below that required to provide adequate overpressure
   protection to the ES.
   6.15.5. A secondary barricade at sites of mission-essential equipment and personnel (such as
   wing communications and trim pads) can provide some additional protection; however, high-
   angle, low-velocity fragments will still impact the exposed site.
   6.15.6. Barricades meeting the requirements of paragraph 6.15.7. may be modified by
   substituting a retaining wall for the slope on one side. The slope and thickness of the
   retaining wall (preferably of concrete) must ensure a wide enough top to hold the earth firmly
   in place.
   6.15.7. The slope of an earthen barricade must be two horizontal to one vertical, unless
   erosion controls are used. Earthen barricades with slopes no greater than one and one half
   horizontal to one vertical that were approved prior to 1976 may continue to be used.
   However, renovations to these facilities will meet the above criteria, when feasible.
6.16. Barricade Size and Orientation to Prevent Prompt Propagation Due to High-
Velocity, Low-Angle Fragments. The location, height, and length of a barricade to prevent
prompt propagation due to high-velocity, low-angle fragments shall be determined as follows:
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     111


   6.16.1. Location. The barricade may be placed anywhere between the PES and the ES;
   however, placing it closer to either the PES or ES will provide slightly greater asset
   protection. For AE stacks of different height (elevation), the location shall determine the
   barricade 's required height.
   6.16.2. Height. To determine the required barricade height:
      6.16.2.1. Establish a reference point at the top of the far edge of one of the two AE
      stacks between which the barricade is to be constructed. When both stacks are of equal
      height, the reference point may be established on either stack. If the tops of the two stacks
      are not of equal height (elevation), the reference point shall be on the top of the lower
      stack. (NOTE: To preclude building excessively high barricades between AE stacks of
      different height (elevation), the barricade should be located as close as possible to the
      lower stack (see Figure 6.2.).)
      6.16.2.2. Draw a line from the reference point to the highest point of the other stack
      (line-of-sight).
      6.16.2.3. The barricade's height shall be such that the entire width of the barricade crest
      is at least 1 ft [0.3 m] above the line-of-sight as established in paragraph 6.16.2.2.
      (NOTE: The barricade height shall be measured at the time of construction as prescribed
      in paragraph 6.16.2. If the specified thickness and height of the barricade are not
      maintained, the AE stack height shall be reduced as necessary or the AE stacks shall be
      resited appropriately. Consideration should be given to making the barricade higher than
      required for safety purposes in order to account for accuracy of storage practices
      regarding AE stack heights, potential mission changes (requiring higher AE stacks), and
      barricade settling/erosion/etc. that could seriously degrade AE storage capability.)
   6.16.3. Length. The barricade's length will be determined per Figure 6.2.
6.17. Barricade Size and Orientation for Barricaded ILD Protection. The location, height,
and length of a barricade shall be determined as follows:
   6.17.1. Location. The barricade may be placed anywhere between the PES and the ES. The
   location shall determine the barricade's required height.
   6.17.2. Height. To determine the required barricade height:
      6.17.2.1. Establish a reference point at the top of the far edge of one of the two AE
      stacks between which the barricade is to be constructed. When both stacks are of equal
      height, the reference point may be established on either stack. If the tops of the two stacks
      are not of equal height (elevation), the reference point shall be on the top of the lower
      stack. (NOTE: To preclude building excessively high barricades, the barricade should be
      located as close as possible to the stack on which the reference point was established (see
      Figure 6.3.).)
          6.17.2.1.1. When the exposed site is not a PES, measure to the top of the ES. If the
          ES is an uninhabited PES (i.e., a service magazine), measure to the top of the stack.
          If the ES is an inhabited PES (i.e., operating location), measure to the top of the ES.
      6.17.2.2. Draw a line from the reference point to the highest point of the other stack.
 112                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       6.17.2.3. Draw a second line from the reference point forming an angle of two degrees
       above the line.
   6.17.3. Length. The barricade 's length shall be determined per Figure 6.3.
6.18. Barricade Size and Orientation for Protection Against Overpressure. General
procedures to predict pressure mitigation versus barricade design and location have not been
developed. However, based on direct-experimental work, the overpressure loading on a surface
area shielded by a barricade is reduced by approximately 50 percent when the following
conditions are met:
   6.18.1. Overpressure barricades are only approved for use when placed at the front of 7-
   BAR ECMs as an ES and a fragment barricade is placed at the PES.
   6.18.2. Location. The barricade’s standoff is within two barricade heights of the protected
   area.
   6.18.3. Height. The top of the barricade is at least as high as the top of the protected area.
   6.18.4. Length. The length of the barricade is at least two times the length of the protected
   area.
6.19. Barricade Construction Materials. Materials for earthen barricades will be reasonably
cohesive and free from harmful (toxic) matter, trash, debris, and stones heavier than ten pounds
[4.54 kg] or larger than six inches [152 mm] in diameter. The larger of acceptable stones will be
limited to the lower center of fills. Earthen material will be compacted and prepared, as
necessary, for structural integrity and erosion control. Solid or wet clay or similar types of soil
will not be used in barricades because they are too cohesive. If it is impossible to use a cohesive
material (e.g., in sandy soil) the barricade will be finished with a suitable material (e.g.,
geotextiles, gunite) that will not produce hazardous debris, but will ensure structural integrity.
6.20. Barricade Designs.
   6.20.1. DDESB TP 15 lists DDESB-approved designs and construction materials for
   barricades. Use of these barricades satisfies barricading criteria.
   6.20.2. Alternate barricade designs (e.g., earth filled steel bin) may be approved by the
   DDESB provided that testing or analysis demonstrates their effectiveness in stopping high
   velocity, low angle fragments.
6.21. Natural Barricades. Natural barricades (e.g., hills) meeting the requirements of this
section are acceptable as barricades. Submit information in the explosives site plan to
demonstrate compliance with barricade design requirements, and include topographical maps of
the terrain.
6.22. Inspection of Barricades. Inspect barricades at least annually to determine the degree of
settling or erosion. MAJCOMs may require more frequent inspection based on environmental
conditions. Barricades finished with a suitable material (e.g., geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) do not
require a depth check as long as there are no signs of the earth fill washing out from underneath
the suitable material. Add fill if a barricade has deteriorated and it no longer provides effective
protection. Also inspect wood riveted barricades and replace rotten timbers or planking.
Maintain barricades so as to prevent erosion or fire hazards. If the magazine’s earth cover erodes

to less than 2 feet repair as soon as practical (not to exceed 90 days) or classify as an
aboveground unbarricaded magazine.

Section 6F—Earth-Filled, Steel Bin-Type Barricades for Outside Storage

6.23. Earth-Filled, Steel Bin-Type Barricades for Outside Storage.
   6.23.1. These barricades, also known as ARMCO, Inc. revetments, are earth-filled steel bins
   used to separate AE awaiting scheduled processing (e.g., AE on a flight line associated with
   aircraft parking or loading operations; or the temporary positioning of AE awaiting transfer
   to preferred, long-term storage). These barricades, which are also used to separate explosive-
   loaded aircraft, are normally used to form a series of cells. They are designed to limit the
   MCE, for QD siting purposes, of AE properly positioned in separate cells by preventing
   prompt detonation transfer to adjacent cells.
   6.23.2. When properly sited, these cells prevent prompt detonation transfer; however; all
   assets in the series of cells are at risk of loss. Although a revetment is effective in limiting
   the blast loading of an adjacent ES to that produced by the largest contents of a single cell,
   there is a significant probability that the contents of many of the cells will be damaged or
   destroyed by the initial and subsequent fire and explosion events. The extent of such losses
   increases with the amount of explosives present.
6.24. ARMCO, Inc. Revetment HD Limits. ARMCO, Inc. revetments cells are approved for
storage of any HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE assigned to SG 1 through 4 (as discussed in paragraph
3.22). In addition, storage of HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 items is approved.
6.25. Types of ARMCO, Inc. Revetments.
   6.25.1. Type A revetments, which must be a minimum of 7 feet [2.1 m] thick, can be used to
   limit a MCE in a series of cells to the largest quantity in a single cell, provided the quantity in
   the single cell does not exceed 30,000 pounds NEW [13,608 kg NEQ].
   6.25.2. Type B revetments, which must be a minimum of 5.25 feet [1.6 m] thick, can be
   similarly used to limit the MCE, provided no cell contains more than 5,000 pounds NEW
   [2,268 kg NEQ].
6.26. Requirements for ARMCO, Inc. Revetments. For ARMCO, Inc. revetments to be used
effectively, the following conditions must be met:
   6.26.1. The criteria shown in Figure 6.2.
   6.26.2. AE will be positioned no closer than 10 feet [3.1 m] from cell walls, no closer than 3
   feet [0.9 m] from the end of the wing walls, and no higher than 2 feet [0.6 m] below the top
   of cell walls.
   6.26.3. AE will be distributed over the available area within the cell, rather than being
   concentrated in a small area.
   6.26.4. AE stored in a cell in quantities near the maximum NEW limit will not be configured
   into a single row of pallets, stacks, or trailers.
   6.26.5. The storage of AE in flammable outer-pack configurations will be minimized.

Section 6G—Substantial Dividing Walls and Blast Doors

6.28. Substantial Dividing Walls. These walls are one way of separating explosives into
smaller groups to minimize the effects of an explosion and allow a reduction in Q-D separation.
To receive credit as a dividing wall, reinforced concrete walls must either meet Substantial
Dividing Wall criteria or be designed in accordance with the criteria in UFC 3-340-02. These
walls may be used to comply with the compatibility group mixing rules given in Chapter 7
provided the required intermagazine separation distance between the substantial dividing walls
are maintained as discussed below. Note: Dividing walls filled with earth or sand, used to
compartmentalize magazines must be at least 5 feet thick with earth or sand packed between
retaining walls. Sand-bag type dividing walls will be at least 5 feet thick, except where approved
for other uses as in TO 11N-20-7. See DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction, for all
storage requirements.
       6.28.1. Definition of an SDW. An SDW is a reinforced concrete wall having the
       following characteristics: (Note: Existing 12-inch reinforced concrete walls originally
       constructed for explosives operations, explosives storage, or remotely controlled
       explosives operations are considered adequate for meeting requirements listed in
       6.28.1.1. through 6.28.1.6. only)
       6.28.1.1. A minimum thickness of 12 inches.
       6.28.1.2. A minimum steel reinforcing bar size of ½-inch (0.50) diameter (#4).
       6.28.1.3. Steel reinforcing bars are spaced not more than 12 inches on center horizontally
       and vertically, on both faces of the wall, with bars on one face staggered with the bars on
       the opposite face.
       6.28.1.4. Concrete cover over the steel reinforcing bars in approximately 2 inches thick.
       6.28.1.5. Concrete has a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 pounds per square inch
       (psi).
       6.28.1.6. SDW main steel is continuous into supports as follows:
           6.28.1.6.1. If the SDW is used for prevention of either prompt detonation or
           propagation of burning reactions, it must, at a minimum, be adequately supported at
           the floor.
           6.28.1.6.2. If the SDW is used for personnel protection, from either detonation or
           burning reactions, for remotely-controlled operations, it must, at a minimum, be
           adequately supported on at least two sides (e.g., the SDW is supported at the floor and
           with at least one adjacent SDW.
   6.28.2. When an SDW described above is incorporated into a room or cubicle, additional
   structural considerations must be addressed in order to limit internal pressure build-up within
   the room or cubicle and assure the capability of the SDW to provide prompt propagation
   protection to munitions in adjacent rooms or cubicles. For this reason, the following
   additional criteria apply to a room or cubicle incorporating one or more SDW:
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    115


     6.28.2.1. A minimum of two surfaces (wall or roof) of the room or cubicle must be open
     and frangible. A surface is considered frangible if its unit weight < 10 lbs/ft2. If a roof is
     treated as one of the frangible surfaces, then any potential additional dead load must be
     considered when calculating the roof’s unit weight. In areas where the design ground
     snow load, pg, in ASCE 7, ―Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures‖
     (latest version) or UFC 3-310-01, ―Structural Load Data,‖ exceeds 20 lbs/ft2, the
     calculation of a roof’s unit weight must include consideration of potential snow load. To
     avoid undue conservatism, the snow load contribution to a roof’s unit weight may be
     taken as 42% of the average roof design snow load, calculated in accordance with ASCE
     7.
     6.28.2.2. A minimum scaled vent area (Av/V2/3) of 1.85 will be provided; where Av =
     total area of frangible and open surfaces (ft2) and V = volume of room (ft3).
     6.28.2.3. When used as a firewall for prevention of propagation of burning reactions, the
     SDW must be continuous from the floor to the roofline to mitigate thermal effects unless
     otherwise required by local fire codes to extend above the roof. When used to prevent a
     prompt detonation reaction, the SDW must be at least two feet higher than the AE stacks
     on either side of the SDW.
     6.28.2.4. Those rooms or cubicles containing only materials that are expected to exhibit
     burning reactions will have adequate venting area; that is, a frangible wall or roof.
  6.28.3. Application and use of SDW for prevention of prompt detonation or propagation of
  burning reactions. The following conditions apply to the use of SDW for the prevention of
  prompt detonation or propagation of burning reactions. When these conditions are not met,
  individual NEWQD of each room or cubicles will be summed together and QD will be based
  on the summed NEWQD.
     6.28.3.1. To prevent a prompt detonation reaction in any acceptor room or cubicle
     separated by an SDW from adjacent donor rooms or cubicles, each adjacent donor room
     or cubicle containing material that will detonate is limited to a maximum of 425 pounds
     NEWQD or to a loading density (NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20 pounds/ft3,
     whichever is attained first. Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.1
     material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds, and to a maximum credible
     event (MCE) of 425 pounds or a loading density of (MCE/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20
     pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first. Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing
     HD 1.2.2 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds. Each adjacent
     donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.3 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of
     5,000 pounds, and to a largest single item NEWQD of 425 pounds or a loading density of
     (largest single item NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20 pounds/ft3, whichever is
     attained first. For HD 1.1 and HD 1.2.1 located in acceptor rooms or cubicles, storage is
     limited to SG 1, 2, 3, and 4 AE only. HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE will be placed no closer
     than 3 feet from the nearest wall.
     6.28.3.2. To prevent a prompt detonation reaction involving SG 5 in an acceptor room or
     cubicle separated by an SDW from adjacent donor rooms or cubicles, each adjacent
     donor room or cubicle containing material that will detonate is limited to a maximum of
     20 pounds NEWQD, or to a loading density (NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.01
     pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first. Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing
116                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      HD 1.2.1 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds, and to an MCE of
      20 pounds or a loading density of (MCE/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.01 pounds/ft3,
      whichever is attained first. Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.2
      material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds. Each adjacent donor room
      or cubicle containing HD 1.2.3 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000
      pounds, and to a largest single item NEWQD of 20 pounds or a loading density of
      (largest single item NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.01 pounds/ft3, whichever is
      attained first. HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE will be placed no closer than 3 feet from the
      nearest wall.
      6.28.3.3. To prevent propagation of a burning reaction (i.e., HD 1.3) between adjacent
      rooms or cubicles separated by an SDW, the NEWQD in each room or cubicle is limited
      to 5,000 pounds of packaged materials or 300 pounds for unpackaged materials. No
      standoff distance from the wall is required for HD 1.3.
      6.28.3.4. When HD 1.2 and HD 1.3 are mixed together within a room or cubicle, their
      combined NEWQD shall be restricted to 5,000 pounds packaged or 300 pounds
      unpackaged. The MCE for HD 1.2.1 and the largest single item NEWQD for HD 1.2.3
      shall comply with the paragraphs above.
  6.28.3.5. Mission essential quantities of HD 1.4 located in donor or acceptor rooms or
  cubicles do not affect the prevention of a prompt detonation reaction or propagation of a
  burning reaction. No standoff distance from the wall is required for HD 1.4.
  6.28.4. Application and use of SDW for personnel protection during remotely controlled AE
  operations. The following apply to the use of SDW for personnel protection during remotely
  controlled AE operations:
      6.28.4.1. Personnel will be separated from operations involving materials that will
      detonate either by the shorter K24 separation distance when measured over or around an
      SDW or by the shortest distance that provides 2.3-psi level of protection to personnel.
      For HD 1.1, the NEWQD shall be used; for HD 1.2.1, the MCE shall be used; for HD
      1.2.2, an NEWQD of 1.6 pounds shall be used; for HD 1.2.3, the largest single item
      NEWQD shall be used.
      6.28.4.2. Personnel will be separated from operations involving only material where a
      burning reaction is expected by the shorter K8 separation distance when measured over
      or around an SDW or by the shortest distance that limits the thermal flux to personnel to
      0.3 calories/cm2/sec.
      6.28.4.3. Personnel will be protected from fragments and debris having energies of 58
      foot-pounds or greater (hazardous fragments). An SDW that is properly supported on
      two sides (such as a reinforced concrete floor and another SDW) will provide such
      personnel protection from a maximum credible event involving up to 300 pounds of AE
      expected to burn or up to 8 pounds of AE expected to detonate. The maximum credible
      event for HD 1.1 shall be the NEWQD; for HD 1.2.1, the MCE shall be used; for HD
      1.2.3, the largest single item NEWQD shall be used. (Note: For HD 1.2.2, the maximum
      credible event is less than 8 pounds, by definition.)
  6.28.5. If any of the SDW criteria discussed above cannot be met, then the wall or room
  design and explosives scenario will be separately analyzed to determine if equivalent
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   117


   protection is provided by the available wall or room arrangement (e.g., a four wall cubicle, an
   alternate reinforced concrete wall design, a larger room, a greater standoff, or a smaller
   quantity of SG 5). The engineering analysis must address the specific conditions according
   to UFC 3-340-02 criteria to determine the proper wall construction or explosives weight and
   spacing limitations. DDESB approval is required for any analysis performed.
   6.28.6. Intraline distance (ILD) level of protection is not addressed by this section. The
   requirement remains K18 or ILD, as specified in the appropriate tables for the HD in
   question. Presently, there is no consideration that an SDW or any type of wall provides an
   equivalent ILD level of protection. However, if an SDW is determined to provide the
   required personnel protection from a remotely controlled operation, then by default, it can be
   assumed that K18 protection is also provided by that SDW. Refer to UFC 3-340-02 and Mil-
   Std 398, Shields, Operational for Ammunition Operations, Criteria for Design and Tests for
   Acceptance, for personnel protection standards.
   6.28.7. For special weapons, the criteria in TO 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety Criteria, when
   more restrictive, will be the limiting factor and override the above criteria.
   6.28.8. The provisions of paragraph 4.19 apply.
6.29. Blast Doors. Blast Doors may be required for openings through SDWs. When required,
design these doors to be at least equal in strength to the SDW. See UFC 3-340-02 for design
factors for new structures. Take care to ensure these doors are not installed as a matter of
convenience. Avoid blast doors when a continuous SDW would not unnecessarily interfere with
operations.

Section 6H—Multicube or Segregated Magazines

6.30. Multicube or Segregated Magazines. See Section 6G for guidance. If the NEWQD
limit is exceeded in any one cell, compatibility must be maintained throughout the facility and
the total NEWQD of all cells is used to compute QD requirements. See paragraph 12.7 for rules
when combining mass detonating with non-mass detonating explosives.
   6.30.1. See paragraph 12.7 for determining MCE. When using the provisions in this
   paragraph, each cell may be considered a separate facility with equivalent IM distance
   between cells, for determining NEWQD in QD calculations.
   6.30.2. A substantial dividing wall that is continuous from the floor to the roofline, unless
   otherwise required by local fire codes to extend above the roof, may be used to meet
   equivalent HD 1.3 intermagazine protection for 5,000 pounds of packaged (shipping or
   transportation configuration) or 300 pounds of unpackaged HD 1.3 materials.

                      EXPLOSIVES OPERATIONS AND STORAGE

Section 7A—Introduction

7.1. Introduction. This chapter provides general information about explosives and safety
requirements for operations involving explosives and explosives storage requirements, to include
compatibility principles and mixed compatibility storage. The absence of specific guidance on a
particular explosives operation does not imply that safeguards are not applicable.

Section 7B—Locally Written Instructions

7.2. Locally Written Instructions. All explosives operations must be conducted in accordance
with written instructions. Item TOs generally fulfill this requirement, but may not address all
local conditions. Locally written instructions may be required to address the items in paragraph
7.3. Locally written instructions may take the form of crew briefings, safety briefings, local
operating instructions, etc. The items in paragraph 7.3 may be addressed by one or more of these
methods.
   7.2.1. Locally written instructions will be:
       7.2.1.1. Approved by the squadron commander or equivalent.
       7.2.1.2. Coordinated with the weapons safety office and all other involved organizations.
       7.2.1.3. Available at the work site.
       7.2.1.4. Written in the language workers understand.
       7.2.1.5. Briefed to all workers prior to beginning an explosives operation.       Ensure
       workers understand the instructions prior to beginning the operation.
   7.2.2. Locally written instructions are not required for EOD emergency operations in
   connection with approved render safe procedures.
   7.2.3. Locally produced checklists and work cards concerning nuclear operations require
   approval according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
   7.2.4. Locally produced operating instructions will be developed and processed according to
   AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
7.3. Contents of Locally Written Instructions. Include the following information, as
applicable, in locally written instructions. The MAJCOM will determine if additional items are
required.
   7.3.1. Personnel limits (see paragraph 7.5.).
   7.3.2. Explosives limits, including HD and CG of the explosives involved (see paragraph
   7.6.).
   7.3.3. Exact locations where operations will be done.

   7.3.4. Safety requirements, to include special requirements for personal protective clothing
   and equipment.
   7.3.5. Step-by-step procedures for doing the task (refer to specific steps in the TO for
   applicable portions of the operation).
   7.3.6. Actions to be taken during an emergency.

Section 7C—General Requirements for Operations Involving Explosives

7.4. Personnel Qualifications. Personnel who work with explosives will be trained in
accordance with AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and qualified in
the tasks to be performed. They must understand all safety standards, requirements, and
precautions that apply to the operation. The supervisor must be knowledgeable of all hazards
involved in the operation, convey emergency procedures to workers, casuals, and visitors, and
maintain strict housekeeping standards. The supervisor must also know what steps to take when
abnormal conditions arise.
7.5. Personnel Limits. Design explosives operations to ensure minimum exposure of personnel
to explosives, in compliance with the cardinal principle (see paragraph 1.1.2). Supervisors are
responsible for enforcing personnel limits.
   7.5.1. Buddy System. Good industrial safety practices may dictate use of the buddy system
   even though only one person may be required to perform the work. Use of the buddy system
   does not violate the cardinal principle.
   7.5.2. EOD Procedures. Performance of EOD procedures requires a minimum of two
   EOD-qualified people (one worker and one for safety back-up and to detect errors in
   procedures). If sent on a mission where performance of EOD procedures is likely, use a
   minimum of two EOD-qualified people. One EOD-qualified person (with an appropriate
   safety back-up capable of rescue actions) can provide site assessments, evaluations, and other
   on-site analysis as long as no procedures are performed and ordnance or explosives are not
   disturbed.
   7.5.3. Casuals. Casuals are persons not normally part of an explosives operation but have
   duties that require their presence, such as quality assurance, medical, safety or inspection
   personnel. Note: When conducting intentional detonation operations,(e.g., EOD operations,
   range clearance, or other demolition and munitions destruction) emergency medical support
   must be available within 30 minutes while the operations are being performed. The medical
   support must be analogous to the expected trauma resulting from an accident.
   7.5.4. Visitors. Visitors are non-essential personnel with limited access. Stop operations
   when visitors are present.
   7.5.5. Posting Personnel Limits. Clearly post personnel limits for the operations being
   conducted at each explosives operating location. Posted limits will distinguish between
   supervisors, workers, and casuals. Locally written instructions containing personnel limits
   will suffice in lieu of posting.
       7.5.5.1. Do not post personnel limits at aircraft parking locations, even if used for
       uploading or downloading explosives.
 124                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       7.5.5.2. Do not post personnel limits at storage locations or licensed explosives storage
       locations.
7.6. Explosives Limits. Design explosives operations to ensure minimum exposure of
personnel to explosives in compliance with the cardinal principle (see paragraph 1.1.2). Only
the explosives needed to ensure a safe and efficient work flow will be present in an operating
location when operations are being conducted; this should normally be limited to a one day
supply. Attempt to comply with compatibility group mixing requirements (see Section 7K), if
possible, to minimize the likelihood and severity of a mishap. Supervisors are responsible for
enforcing explosives limits.
   7.6.1. Posting Explosives Limits. Clearly post the authorized HD and NEWQD at all
   explosives locations, to include MCE for HD 1.2.1, NEWQD of the largest single round for
   HD 1.2.3, and (xx) for HD 1.2.3. A properly displayed explosives license (see Chapter 11)
   fulfills this requirement for licensed explosives storage locations. For all other explosives
   storage locations, locally written instructions (see Section 7B) containing authorized HD and
   NEWQD will suffice if posting is impractical. Locally written instructions containing HD
   and NEWQD will suffice in lieu of posting for all explosives operating locations.
   7.6.2. Posting Operating Limits. For explosives operating locations, clearly post the HD
   and NEWQD limits (to include MCE for HD 1.2.1, NEWQD of the largest single round for
   HD 1.2.3, and (xx) for HD 1.2.3) for the operation being conducted, if less than the
   authorized explosives limits. These limits may be expressed in terms of the specific
   explosives items, such as ―two AIM-9 missiles.‖ Locally written instructions (see Section
   7B) containing HD and NEWQD will suffice in lieu of posting.
7.7. Housekeeping. The following are minimum precautions:
   7.7.1. Non-explosives Waste Materials.
       7.7.1.1. Do not commingle non-explosives waste materials (e.g., oily rags, combustible
       scrap, wood, paper, and flammable packing materials) with explosives residue.
       7.7.1.2. Place non-explosives waste materials in approved, properly marked containers.
       7.7.1.3. Place non-explosives waste material containers outside of explosives facilities,
       except for containers required at work locations during operations.
       7.7.1.4. Empty non-explosives waste material containers at working locations as often as
       needed, but at least once each workday or shift.
       7.7.1.5. Contact the base environmental management office for additional guidance for
       hazardous materials.
   7.7.2. Explosives Residue.
       7.7.2.1. Provide grounded, covered, self-closing containers for explosives residue and
       materials containing explosives residue (e.g., rags, clothing).
       7.7.2.2. Cover explosives residue and waste materials containing explosives residue with
       water or oil, if this does not add to the hazard. Number 10 mineral oil is useful for
       covering pyrotechnic, tracer, flare, and similar mixtures. If using water, immediately
       immerse the items to reduce production of dangerous gases.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   125


       7.7.2.3. Remove explosives residue and materials containing explosives residue at
       frequent intervals and before leaving at the end of the duty day or shift. Place in the
       disposal area or an isolated temporary collection point.
       7.7.2.4. When using isolated temporary collection points, set up time and quantity limits
       to ensure timely movement of collected material to the disposal area. Do not store
       collected material in the disposal area.
       7.7.2.5. Dispose of explosives residue and materials containing explosives residue in
       accordance with environmental standards and locally written instructions (see Section
       7B) approved by the base environmental management office.
   7.7.3. Cleaning Compounds.
       7.7.3.1. Do not use cleaning compounds containing wax or oil on conductive floors or
       surfaces.
       7.7.3.2. Do not use cleaning agents that include caustic alkalis in locations containing
       explosives residue (sensitive explosives compounds may be formed).
       7.7.3.3. Remove explosives residue in accordance with the item TO.
       7.7.3.4. Use non-abrasive cleaning compounds; such compounds are often combustible
       but not volatile. Closed cup flash point of cleaning compounds must not be less than
       230o F.
7.8. Smoking. AFOSH 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities,
Chapter 1, governs smoking on the flightline. For all other explosives locations, the following
requirements apply:
   7.8.1. Allow smoking in an explosives storage area or operating location only in specifically
   designated locations, where ―authorized smoking areas‖ signs are posted.
   7.8.2. A ―No Smoking Except in Designated Areas‖ or ―No Smoking‖ sign will be posted at
   each entrance to an explosives storage area.
   7.8.3. In an explosives storage area or operating location containing exposed explosives,
   include a notice that flame-producing devices must be turned over to the entry controller or
   placed in a container provided.
   7.8.4. Requirements for Designated Smoking Locations.
       7.8.4.1. Do not place within 50 feet of any explosives locations (to include conveyances
       or material handling equipment loaded with explosives items).
       7.8.4.2. Coordinate proposed location with weapons safety, and obtain installation fire
       chief or delegate approval. Approval will address whether a fire extinguisher must be
       available. Display a certification of approval in each designated smoking location.
       7.8.4.3. Provide suitable self-closing or self contained properly marked receptacles for
       extinguishing smoking materials.
       7.8.4.4. Provision of an electrical push-button type lighter that cuts off when pressure is
       released, or when the lighter tips over, is recommended.
 126                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       7.8.4.5. Persons wearing clothing contaminated with flammables, explosives or other
       hazardous materials are not allowed in designated smoking areas.
   7.8.5. Do not smoke in, on, or within 50 feet of any conveyance or material handling
   equipment loaded with explosives items.
7.9. Handling of Explosives. This paragraph applies to the handling of explosives and
movement of explosives within the immediate vicinity of an explosives operation.
   7.9.1. Only trained personnel under the supervision of an individual who understands the
   hazards and risks involved in the operation are to handle explosives.
   7.9.2. Handle detonators, initiators, squibs, and other such electrically or mechanically
   initiated devices in protective containers during storage, transportation, and inspection. Use
   containers designed to prevent item-to-item contact. Mark to identify the contents.
   7.9.3. Do not use bale hooks to handle explosives.
   7.9.4. Do not use nails to secure covers or make repairs on explosives containers unless there
   is no hazard to the explosive item or danger of penetrating protective coverings. Exercise
   special care when using pneumatic- or cartridge-activated nail guns (see AFI 21-201,
   Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management).
   7.9.5. Do not tumble, drag, drop, throw, roll, or ―walk‖ munitions. Containers designed with
   skids may be pushed or pulled for positioning.
   7.9.6. Do not roll un-palletized conventional high explosive bombs or other explosives
   unless authorized by the item TO and lugs or other projections have been removed or if they
   are protected by dunnage rails.
   7.9.7. Do not use conveyors, chutes, hand trucks, or forklifts in atmospheres and locations
   where they will create hazards.
   7.9.8. Interlock and support sections of roller conveyors used to move explosives. Do not
   use boxes containing explosives or munitions to support conveyors.
   7.9.9. Always consider vehicle and handling equipment type, type of load, and prevailing
   weather and surface conditions when determining if safe movement is feasible.
   7.9.10. Restraining devices designed for use with vehicle and handling equipment will be
   used in accordance with applicable TOs.
   7.9.11. Do not move explosives rapidly across any non-conductive surface.
7.10. Portable Equipment.
   7.10.1. Ensure portable electronic equipment introduced to a hazardous location meets the
   requirements of paragraph 5.4.
   7.10.2. UL-listed floodlight systems, mounted on heavy portable stands and placed outside
   the magazine door or the outdoor working area, may be used where required. Service cords
   must be placed or protected so that they cannot be walked on or run over by equipment.
   7.10.3. Flexible cords should be type SO hard service cord. Splices are not allowed. All
   flexible cords, receptacles, and attachment plugs must be equipped with three prongs so that
   the third prong (green wire) acts as ground. Place or protect each electrical cord so that it
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     127


   cannot be walked on or run over by equipment. Flexible cords will not be used in place of
   fixed or installed electrical wiring. Damaged flexible cords will be immediately removed
   from service.

Section 7D—Static Grounding

7.11. Static Electricity. Static electricity is created when two different materials come in
contact and then are separated again; this includes when the two materials are rubbed against
each other. Separated charges accumulate on the two materials, creating a voltage potential that
can be discharged when either of the materials is moved close to an uncharged or grounded
object. This discharge can cause a mishap if it occurs through, or in the presence of, a hazardous
substance susceptible to electrostatic initiation. For this reason, precautions shall be taken
against performing unnecessary actions that lead to the buildup of static voltages, actions shall be
taken to avoid the prolonged storage of static voltages on personnel or equipment, and actions
shall be taken to discharge static voltages in a safe and controlled manner during operations
involving explosives. See Section 5E for the static grounding and bonding system design and
inspection requirements.
7.12. Requirement for Static Grounding. See paragraph 7.15 for static grounding techniques
and paragraph 7.16 for methods to reduce the buildup of static electricity. Static grounding is
required for:
   7.12.1. Personnel, equipment, and explosives, when the responsible engineering function has
   determined grounding is necessary for specific maintenance or electrical test operations;
   grounding requirements will normally be included in the item TO.
   7.12.2. Weapons systems in storage as required in the item TO.
   7.12.3. Personnel and equipment in hazardous locations (see Section 5C).
   7.12.4. Personnel handling EEDs (see Electro-Explosive Device in Attachment 1). Note:
   Always avoid directly touching an electrical primer. See paragraph 7.13 for static grounding
   requirements for handling unpackaged EEDs.
   7.12.5. Personnel handling exposed explosives (see exposed explosives in Attachment 1);
   this does not apply to C-4.
   7.12.6. Explosive components which incorporate an electrical initiating system when
   undergoing maintenance; assembly to, or disassembly from, an all-up-round (AUR)
   configuration; or electrical connection or disconnection. Note: Unless required by TO, static
   grounding is not required when replacing components of AURs which incorporate an
   electrical initiating system when the replacement operation does not require electrical
   connection or disconnection.
   7.12.7. Aircraft, when explosives are being loaded or unloaded, as required in paragraph
   7.14.
7.13. Static Grounding for Handling Unpackaged EEDs. When EEDs are unpackaged and
handled follow item TO requirements for static grounding and comply with the following:
   7.13.1. Personnel must periodically ground themselves. Post signs at entrances and in the
   room reminding personnel that periodic grounding is required, except where compliance
 128                                                          AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   would create any additional personnel safety hazard. Install one or more static grounding
   bars or device (see paragraph 5.12.2) and require personnel to touch the grounding device
   before handling the EED and at frequent intervals while working to discharge any static
   potential.
   7.13.2. Where feasible, comply with paragraphs 7.15.1.1 and 7.15.1.3.
   7.13.3. Adhere to the precautions in paragraph 7.16.
   7.13.4. Every person who handles exposed EED’s must be careful not to allow the EED’s
   electrical contacts to touch any of the metal surfaces of aircraft and missile skin or structure.
   Additionally, the handler must actively take precautions against allowing the build up or
   discharge of static electric energy through the EED’s electrical contacts.
7.14. Static Grounding for Aircraft During Explosives Loading and Unloading. Combat
and cargo aircraft will be grounded during explosives loading or unloading operations, except as
noted in paragraphs 7.14.1 and 7.14.2. See TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
Static Grounding/Bonding and applicable aircraft TO for grounding procedures. Personnel
handling the explosives will equalize their static electrical potential to that of the aircraft, vehicle
or handling equipment, before beginning operations and at frequent intervals thereafter to
discharge any static buildup. Ensure the aircraft being loaded or unloaded is not within the
hazard zone of any operating transmitters (see Chapter 9).
   7.14.1. Cargo aircraft do not require grounding during engine running on/off (ERO)
   operations.
   7.14.2. Grounding of aircraft during explosives loading or unloading is recommended but
   not required where there are unusual parking problems in operating from bare or limited
   bases, nonmilitary airfields, host nation airfields, etc. This exception does not relieve
   commands from responsibility for providing proper grounding in locations where operations
   continue or where parking facilities are required on a recurring basis. Where static
   grounding facilities are not available at a suitable parking location, commands should use the
   best alternate method of reducing the hazard in the following order or precedence:
       7.14.2.1. Keep static grounding to 10,000 Ohms or less by using ground rods.
       7.14.2.2. Equalize the static electrical potential between the aircraft and the vehicle or
       handling equipment used in loading or unloading by bonding them together with an
       approved static ground wire, cable, or strap (see paragraph 5.14). Note: It might not be
       feasible to bond the handling equipment to the aircraft if the handling equipment must
       move during the operation.
7.15. Static Grounding Techniques. In the absence of TO guidance, this paragraph provides
techniques for accomplishing static grounding (see paragraphs 5.13 through 5.15 for further
guidance).
   7.15.1. Protective clothing is not a substitute for personnel static grounding.               Static
   grounding of personnel will be accomplished by any of the following:
       7.15.1.1. Through the use of wrist-straps connected to the facility ground.
       7.15.1.2. By periodically touching a grounded surface (such as an airframe) or a
       grounding bar.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    129


       7.15.1.3. By wearing conductive footwear on conductive floors, mats or runners (see
       Section 5F), if the floor, mat, or runner is properly grounded.
   7.15.2. Static grounding of equipment will be accomplished by any of the following:
       7.15.2.1. Through the use of a static ground wire, cable, or strap (see paragraph 5.14)
       between the item to be grounded and the facility ground.
       7.15.2.2. By using conductive tabletops, or conductive material coverings on the
       tabletop, if the conductive surface or material is properly grounded.
   7.15.3. When making a grounding connection, attach the ground wire, cable, or strap to the
   item requiring grounding first, then connect the other end of the ground wire, cable, or strap
   to the approved facility grounding system. This ensures that if a spark occurs, it will occur at
   the connection to the facility grounding system instead of at the item.
       7.15.3.1. If the existing static grounding or bonding reels were permanently attached to
       the facility ground when installed, a temporary grounding connection using an additional
       cable should be made first (when possible) following the procedure in paragraph 7.15.3
       before connecting the item to the permanent system.
       7.15.3.2. When static grounding or bonding reels are installed, either in new or existing
       facilities, do not permanently attach them to the facility grounding system.
   7.15.4. When a different or new ground is needed for an item, always make the new ground
   connection first (in the same manner as described in paragraph 7.15.2) before disconnecting
   the existing ground connection (make-before-break grounding). This ensures that the item
   will be grounded at all times while transitioning from one ground connection to another.
7.16. Methods to Reduce the Hazards of Static Electricity. Personnel can minimize the
possibility and severity of both the buildup and discharge of hazardous static electric potentials
by observing the following guidance.
   7.16.1. Whenever possible, personnel should avoid using rags or wearing outer garments
   made of materials which have high static-generating characteristics (e.g., 100% polyester,
   nylon, rayon, silk, wool, etc.). Wool socks, glove inserts, and caps as well as undergarments
   of synthetic fabrics are less of a hazard than outer garments such as jackets or pants.
   7.16.2. Whenever possible, personnel should use rags or wear outer garments made of cotton
   or a cotton-synthetic blend.
       7.16.2.1. Clothing materials acceptable for flightline use (per Allowance Standard 016,
       Special Purpose Clothing and Personal Equipment) are acceptable for handling
       munitions; this includes Gortex even though it is 100% nylon.
       7.16.2.2. When clothing is worn which has a high static-generating characteristic, such
       as Gortex or some flak vests, the techniques listed for controlling the discharge of any
       generated potentials shall be further emphasized.
   7.16.3. Minimize exposure to conditions which aid the buildup of static electricity such as
   cold, dry climates or dry, windy climates.
   7.16.4. Minimize activities which aid the buildup of static electricity such as physical motion
   or contact with moving non-conductive substances.
 130                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   7.16.5. Control the discharge of any generated static electric potential by touching a static
   grounding bar or device (or by equalizing it to that of the system being handled) prior to
   touching the system and at frequent intervals during operations.
   7.16.6. Minimize activities which can cause an uncontrolled discharge of static electric
   potential such as the quick or repeated removal of outer garments.

Section 7E—Testing, Procedures Verification, Disassembling and Modifying Explosives Items

7.17. Requirements for Test, Disassembly, and Modification of Explosives Items.
   7.17.1. Modify, test, or disassemble explosives items only under the following
   circumstances:
       7.17.1.1. When authorized by item TO.
       7.17.1.2. When MAJCOM and either the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) item
       manager or System Sustainment Manager (SSM) grant approval.
       7.17.1.3. When EOD personnel perform render safe operations, technical intelligence
       gathering, or for special projects authorized per AFI 32-3001, The Air Force EOD
       Program.
   7.17.2. Allow only technically qualified personnel to test, disassemble, or modify explosives
   items.
   7.17.3. Before starting operations, supervisors must ensure all requirements of Section 7B
   have been met.
   7.17.4. Dry run all new procedures with inert or simulated explosives items when possible.
   7.17.5. Handling new or test munitions (versus operational munitions) requires personnel
   certification. Use inert items when possible for certification.
   7.17.6. Suspended munitions (code condition J) must not be used unless specifically
   authorized by the item manager for:
       7.17.6.1. Dry runs.
       7.17.6.2. Personnel or test procedure certification, verification, or validation.
       7.17.6.3. Electrical testing of aircraft or other weapons systems.
   7.17.7. Comply with paragraph 7.18 for electrical testing of explosives items.
   7.17.8. Comply with paragraph 7.19 for weapons system testing involving live explosives.
   7.17.9. Comply with paragraph 4.17 to determine the need for protective shielding and
   remotely controlled operations.
7.18. Electrical Testing of Explosives Items.
   7.18.1. Follow instructions in specific weapon or weapons system TOs for testing individual
   explosives items or weapon systems containing explosives items. Where there is doubt about
   the safety or adequacy of any test procedure or instrumentation, submit a request to the
   responsible technical agency (prime AFMC element) for advice or assistance.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     131


   7.18.2. Ensure electrical test equipment introduced to a hazardous location meets the
   requirements of paragraph 5.4.
   7.18.3. In developing specific weapon and weapons system TOs, the responsible engineering
   function should consider the following guidance:
       7.18.3.1. Electrical or electronic test equipment should normally use the weakest
       possible power source. If feasible, require the use of battery-powered equipment instead
       of a 110-volt source.
       7.18.3.2. The test power source should be incapable of initiating the explosive item being
       tested. Where greater power must be used, provide positive safeguards to prevent
       delivery of enough power to initiate the item.
       7.18.3.3. Unless the test equipment is incapable of initiating the item being tested,
       operational shields (see paragraph 4.17) should be provided, where needed, to protect
       personnel from injury.
       7.18.3.4. Special attention should be given to the ventilation requirements of equipment
       containing vacuum tubes and the possibility of malfunction of equipment using resistors
       and other devices for limiting testing power.
       7.18.3.5. The explosive item, test equipment, and leads should be protected from
       exposure to electromagnetic (induction and radiation fields) and electrostatic energy of
       more than an order of magnitude less than that required to initiate an explosion (see
       Chapter 9).
7.19. Use of Live Explosives for Weapons System Testing. Do not use live explosives items
for verification, validation, or electrical testing of aircraft or other weapons systems except as
follows:
   7.19.1. The conduct of research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) and operational
   test and evaluation (OT&E) flight testing or ―Built-In Test‖ (BIT) checks or other low-
   current aircraft testing with live explosives installed, as long as doing so does not conflict
   with other applicable guidance such as T.O. 11A-1-33, Handling and Maintenance of
   Explosives-Loaded Aircraft.
   7.19.2. If an inert item is available but a live item is scheduled to be used, provide
   MAJCOM/A4W/SEW/A3T with the test plan and a risk assessment that includes appropriate
   personnel protection (see Section 4F) for their approval.
   7.19.3. If an inert item is not in the inventory and a live item must be used, tests will only be
   performed by qualified personnel with test squadron commander approval. Coordinate test
   plans with the weapons safety office.
   7.19.4. If an inert item is not in the inventory and a live item must be used, operational
   command personnel can perform the test provided approval is obtained from, and the test
   plan and a risk assessment (including appropriate personnel protection) is approved by
   MAJCOM/A4W/SEW/A3T (see Section 4F).

   approved drawings. MAJCOMs may approve use of existing magazines of other
   descriptions (including contractors' facilities) if they provide the proper degree of protection
   and safety.
7.36. Explosives Storage in Operating Locations. Explosives may be stored in an operating
location when operations are not being conducted, provided all other storage criteria are met.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 141


7.37. Explosives Storage Facility Maintenance.
   7.37.1. Practice good housekeeping in all locations.
   7.37.2. Keep structures in good condition and suitable for the storage of munitions types and
   hazard divisions involved.
   7.37.3. Certain items which contain explosives have stringent temperature limitations (see
   applicable TO). Take precautions to ensure these limits are not exceeded.
7.38. Explosives Stocks Maintenance.
   7.38.1. Keep outer containers in good condition and securely closed.
   7.38.2. Stacks of containers must be stable and arranged in magazines or other approved
   locations according to storage drawings or directives.
   7.38.3. Provide ventilation when required by civil engineering, logistics and health
   directives.
   7.38.4. Block storage is allowed if stack ventilation is maintained when required by civil
   engineering, logistics or health directives.
   7.38.5. Maintain aisles so each stack may be inspected.
7.38.6. Inert and live AE or munitions components may be stored together. However,
training items must be physically separated from the live items they represent.
7.39. Marking of Explosives Stocks.
   7.39.1. Keep boxes properly closed and clearly marked to show contents and quantity.
   Requirements of TO 11A-1-10, General Instructions--Munitions Serviceability Procedures
   and the item TO apply.
   7.39.2. For dangerously unserviceable, unserviceable, or suspended lots, mark each package
   or stack to show its exact status. The markings must be clear to prevent inadvertent issue or
   loss of information.
      7.39.3. Properly packed AE may not be stored with loose AE items, single inner
      packages (nonmetal), or explosives in unserviceable containers.
      7.39.4. Properly packed AE may be stored with nonstandard boxes of AE in accordance
      with the CG.
7.40. Munitions in Austere Areas.
   7.40.1. The austere area provisions of paragraph 7.40.2 for explosives storage areas are
   authorized for use in:
      7.40.1.1. All zones where hostilities exist.
      7.40.1.2. Areas approved by Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), United States Air Forces in
      Europe (USAFE) and United States Central Command Air Forces (AFCENT), where
      arrangement under paragraph 13.5 will allow their application.
      7.40.1.3. All bare or limited bases.
      7.40.1.4. Other areas as may be approved by AFSC/SEW.
 142                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   7.40.2. Austere Area Provisions.
       7.40.2.1. Minimum separations should prevent simultaneous detonation of explosives on
       opposite sides of an approved barricade and minimize the possibility of later, non-
       simultaneous propagating explosions. Use greater separations where possible.
       7.40.2.2. Open storage is authorized for all HD of munitions and explosives. Give
       priority for cover to items requiring protection from the elements, considering the type of
       packing material involved.
       7.40.2.3. Avoid single stacks of large quantities of mass-detonating explosives. Smaller
       stacks may limit losses due to accident or enemy action and often result in decreased land
       area requirement. Smaller stacks reduce the distance required between the explosives
       storage area and other exposures, such as flightline areas, inhabited buildings, or bulk
       petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) storage.
       7.40.2.4. When normal aboveground magazine separation is not feasible, use barricaded
       open storage modules (see Section 6D). Large quantities of explosives may be stored in
       this manner with relative safety.
       7.40.2.5. If land is scarce and covered storage is required, consider the use of approved
       steel arch ECMs. These sectionalized, corrugated-arch structures allow storage of
       maximum amounts of mass-detonating explosives with minimum space between ECMs.
       They are available in any practical length in widths up to 30 feet. The commonly-used
       earth cover gives acceptable protection against propagation of an explosion from one
       ECM to another.
       7.40.2.6. Site tri-service or joint-use storage facilities using DoD 6055.09-M, DoD
       Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.
7.41. Privately-owned Ammunition. Privately-owned ammunition allowed on an Air Force
installation (see paragraph 3.13.1.1) will be stored as follows:
   7.41.1. Base housing residents (i.e., military families living in government-provided family
   housing) can store their privately-owned ammunition in their quarters.
   7.41.2. Billeting and dormitory residents cannot store their privately-owned ammunition in
   their quarters.
   7.41.3. Privately-owned ammunition stored on an Air Force installation must be stored in a
   licensed or sited explosives storage location (except as noted in paragraph 11.25).
   7.41.4. Privately-owned ammunition will not be stored in a munitions storage area (MSA).
7.42. Government Arms and Ammunition. MAJCOMs may authorize the storage of DoD
firearms in explosives storage areas to meet operational commitments. Refer to AFI 21-201 for
general requirements.

Section 7J—Storage and Compatibility Principles

7.43. Storage and Compatibility Principles.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   143


   7.43.1. AE may not be stored with dissimilar substances or articles (e.g., flammable or
   combustible materials, acids, or corrosives) that may present additional hazards to the AE
   unless they have been assessed to be compatible.
   7.43.2. AE may not be stored with unrelated non-AE items (e.g., powered lift trucks,
   dunnage, empty boxes, unused pallets, excess packing material).
   7.43.3. AE may be stored with related noncombustible equipment as necessary to support
   approved contingency or war plans requiring ready use of such equipment.
   7.43.4. Not-Regulated AE and AE assigned to Classes 2 through 9 may have a CG assigned.
   When so assigned, the AE may be stored with Class 1 AE in accordance with the CG.
   7.43.5. AE in damaged packaging, in suspect condition, or with characteristics that increase
   risk in storage, are not compatible with other AE and will be stored separately as CG L.
   7.43.6. Treat AE received without an assigned hazard classification as HD 1.1L and place in
   segregated storage. Contact AFSC/SEW for assistance.
   7.43.7. Segregate serviceable AE from unserviceable AE, including lots suspended from
   issue and use. Put them in a separate facility or segregate them physically within the same
   facility. If they remain in the same facility, clearly separate the unserviceable items using
   ropes, tape, painted lines or other highly visible means.
7.44. Found-on-Base AE. Treat found-on-base AE of an unknown hazard division as HD 1.1L.
If local munitions or EOD technicians can identify a found-on-base AE item sufficiently to
determine that it is the same as a stock listed, hazard classified item, then it may be stored in
accordance with that hazard classification. Ball cartridges, .50 cal and smaller, and all gauge of
shotgun shells, may be treated as HD 1.4C; these same items may be treated as HD 1.4S if this
hazard classification can be definitely established. Recognize that unidentified AE may contain
viable chemical or biological warfare agents, including recovered munitions from historic burial
or off-shore disposal sites. If AE is suspected to contain chemical or biological warfare agents,
activate local incident management system and wait for confirmation from the appropriate
agency (Fire Department, Emergency Management, Bioenvironmental Engineering). Contact
the MAJCOM Treaty Compliance Officer if the item is identified as a chemical or biological
munitions item.
7.45. Dangerously Unserviceable AE. Treat dangerously unserviceable AE as CG L and store
in an isolated location separated from other AE storage facilities by intermagazine distance.
Dangerously unserviceable items are those which have a substantially greater probability of
inadvertent or unintentional activation than a normal item. Examples: Unexploded Ordnance
(UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), and components thereof, even when rendered
safe; or other unserviceable explosives or components that have undergone abnormal or
unknown environments (e.g., aircraft crash, natural disaster, or other unknown conditions).

Section 7K—Mixed Compatibility Group Storage

7.46. Mixed Compatibility Group Storage. Separate storage of AE by HD and type provides
the highest degree of safety. Because such storage is generally not feasible, mixed storage—
subject to compliance with this Manual—is normally implemented when such storage facilitates
safe operation and promotes overall storage efficiency. The CG assigned to AE indicates what
 144                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


can be stored with the AE without increasing significantly either an accident's probability or, for
a given quantity, the magnitude of an accident’s effects. AE of different CG may only be mixed
in storage as indicated in Table 7.1, or as follows:
   7.46.1. Compliance with compatibility and mixing requirements is desirable, but not
   mandatory, during contingencies, combat operations, MOOTW, or associated training.
   7.46.2. AE packaged and configured for rapid response (e.g., Rapid Deployment Force) may
   be mixed without complying with the compatibility and mixing requirements, as
   operationally required to achieve the optimum load needed by the intended receiving troops.
   The maximum credible event allowable at any of these storage sites shall be limited to 8,818
   lbs NEWQD. When computing QD requirements for such sites, Chapter 12 applies.
   However, the following AE will be excluded for NEWQD determination at such storage
   sites:
       7.46.2.1. Propelling charges in HD 1.2 fixed, semi-fixed, mortar, and rocket AE.
       7.46.2.2. The NEWQD of HD 1.3 items, except at sites that contain only HD 1.3 items.
       At such sites, HD 1.3 QD applies. (Note: In the application of this paragraph, to separate
       loading AE, the explosive weight of propelling charges is generally excluded when
       matched pairs of projectiles and propelling charges are at the site. However, if the
       quantity of propelling charges at the site exceeds the maximum usable for the quantity of
       projectiles at the site, the explosive weights of all propelling charges and projectiles at the
       site must be summed for NEWQD determination.)

NOTES:
1. An ―X‖ at an intersection indicates that the groups may be combined in storage. Otherwise,
mixing is either prohibited or restricted per Note 2 below.

2. A ―Z‖ at an intersection indicates that when warranted by operational considerations or
magazine non-availability, and when safety is not sacrificed, mixed storage of limited quantities
(less than 8,818 lbs total NEWQD) of some items from different groups is acceptable subject to
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  145


approval from at least the munitions storage area commander. Approval must be in writing and
must be kept on site. Mixed storage of items within groups where no X or Z exists at that pair’s
intersection, requires a deviation (see paragraph 1.4). Examples of acceptable storage
combinations are:

       a. HD 1.1A initiating explosives with HD 1.1B fuzes not containing two or more
       effective protective features.

       b. HD 1.3C bulk propellants or bagged propelling charges with HD 1.3G pyrotechnic
       substances.

3. Equal numbers of separately packaged components of hazard classified complete rounds of
any single type of AE (i.e., missiles, general purpose bombs, etc.) may be stored together. They
may also be stored with assembled rounds made up from these components. When so stored,
compatibility is that of the complete round. That is, group H for WP rounds; group D, E, or F, as
appropriate, for HE rounds. (The ―equal number‖ provision is intended to limit the material
stored to enough packaged components to make up the desired number of complete rounds. It is
not necessary to unpack extra components from normal packaging to make an ―equal numbers‖
condition.)

4. CG K requires not only separate storage from other groups, but also may require separate
storage within the group. AFSC/SEW will determine which items under CG K may be mixed
with other items and which must be kept separate, when such a requirement develops. Request
AFSC/SEW determination through MAJCOM/SEW.

5. AE classed outside Class 1 may be assigned the same CG as Class 1 AE containing similar
hazard features, but where the explosive hazard predominates. Non-Class 1 AE and Class 1 AE
assigned the same CG may be stored together.

6. Ammunition designated ―Practice‖ or ―Target Practice‖ by NSN and nomenclature may be
combined with the fully-loaded ammunition that it simulates (e.g., 2.75-inch target practice
rockets with WP rockets).

7. For purposes of mixing, all AE must be packaged in its standard storage and shipping
container. AE containers will not be opened for issuing items from storage locations. Outer
containers may be opened in storage locations for inventorying and for magazines storing only
HD 1.4 items, unpacking, inspecting, and repackaging the HD 1.4 ammunition. (See paragraph
7.32)

8. When using the ―Z‖ mixing authorized by Note 2 for articles of either CG B or CG F, each
will be segregated in storage from articles of other CG by means that prevent propagation of CG
B or CG F articles to articles of other CG.

9. If dissimilar HD 1.6N AE are mixed together and have not been tested to ensure non-
propagation, the mixed AE are individually considered to be HD 1.2.1 D or HD 1.2.2 D based on
 146                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


their NEWQD or overriding fragmentation characteristics for purposes of transportation and
storage. When mixing CG N AE with CG B through CG G or with CG S, see Section 12C to
determine the HD for the mixture.

10. Articles in group L must be segregated in a separate facility or meet the requirements of
paragraph 6.30 - multicubes. Group L articles are not compatible with other articles in group L
unless they are identical items.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   147

                            EXPLOSIVES TRANSPORTATION

Section 8A—Introduction

8.1. Introduction. This chapter gives safety requirements for transporting explosives and for
operating vehicles and materials handling equipment in explosives locations. In-use ammunition
items that must accompany security forces or other defense forces are not governed by
transportation rules. QD criteria does not apply to munitions and explosives in the transportation
mode. Take precautions to ensure minimum exposure of people and property during all phases
of transportation. The time munitions and explosives are in the transportation mode must be
limited to the absolute minimum necessary to complete the task.

Section 8B—Explosives Transportation Standards

8.2. Federal Regulation. Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) regulates
commercial shipment of hazardous material, including explosives, by rail, motor vehicle, cargo
aircraft and ship within the United States (except maritime explosives). Rules in Title 49 CFR
only apply on military installations when specifically prescribed. For transporting explosives
and munitions on an Air Force installation use the criteria is this Manual. For transporting
military explosives and munitions not on an Air Force installation, but in an Air Force
conveyance, operated by Air Force personnel, the rules in Title 49 CFR must be applied to the
extent they are prescribed in United States Air Force and Department of Defense directives. See
paragraph 8.3 for examples, but not an exhaustive list, of such publications.
8.3. DoD Directives. In addition to this Manual, the following directives apply to military
shipments of hazardous materials within the defense transportation system: AFJI 11-204,
Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material; AFMAN 24-204, Preparing
Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment; T.O. 11N-45-51 series, Transportation of
Nuclear Weapons, Materiel, General Shipping, and Limited Life Components (LLC) Data;
Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9R Part 2 and AFJI 24-210, Packaging of
Hazardous Material; AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo; AFI 24-301,
Transportation Vehicle Operations, MILSTD 129, Military Marking for Shipment and Storage.
8.4. Local Laws Regulating Transportation of Explosives and Dangerous Articles. Each
state and nearly all local and foreign governments have laws or ordinances regulating
transportation of explosives and other dangerous articles within their jurisdiction. Obey local
laws where state, local or host nation governments have jurisdiction. Where there is exclusive
federal jurisdiction, local laws may not apply. Where there is a conflict, contact your MAJCOM
for clarification.

Section 8C—Hazard Classification for Explosives Transportation

8.5. Hazard Classification Requirements for Transportation. Explosives, to be acceptable
for transportation by any mode, must have an assigned hazard classification (HD; storage
compatibility group; DOT class, markings, shipping name and label; and United Nations serial
number), except as noted in paragraph 8.6. Developmental items, test articles, components, and
 148                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


certain commercial items that contain explosives, but without a final classification must be
assigned an interim hazard classification. See Chapter 3 for hazard classification procedures.
8.6. Commercial         Explosives       Hazard         Classification       Requirements       for
Transportation. Commercial explosive items purchased for official use must have a hazard
classification assigned in accordance with T.O. 11A-1-47 before transportation and use, except
as provided in this paragraph. Store, transport, or offer for transportation, commercial explosives
that have not been examined, hazard classified, and approved by DoD in accordance with Title
49 CFR 173.56(b)(2) provided one of the following paragraphs is complied with:
   8.6.1. The explosive has been designated, in writing, by the Associate Administrator for
   Hazardous Materials Safety (AAHMS), Research and Special Programs Administration,
   DOT, as ―Not Regulated.‖
   8.6.2. The explosive has been approved for transportation, in writing, by the AAHMS in a
   Classification of Explosives, Competent Authority Approval, or in a Confirmation of
   Acceptability of a foreign Competent Authority Approval, and the hazard classification of
   the explosive is HD 1.4S.
8.7. Compatibility of Explosives During Transportation. Part 177, Subpart C, Title 49 CFR
provides guidance for separating and segregating hazardous materials, including different
explosives, in the various modes of commercial transportation. Explosives transported on a
public highway by Air Force motor vehicles, operated by Air Force personnel, will be separated
and segregated using the rules in Title 49 CFR, except as otherwise provided in this Manual or
other applicable military directives. When an item containing explosives is assigned to other
than hazard class 1 because of the predominant hazard, a compatibility group is still assigned
(see paragraph 3.5.1.2). For these items, compatibility for transportation, and temporary
storage incident to transportation, must be based on rules for the assigned hazard class, not on the
compatibility group. The compatibility group for these items applies only to long term storage.
Cargo-configured items that may be shipped in the same Air Force aircraft are listed in AFMAN
24-204 and T.O. 11N-45-51 series. Procedures for submitting a compatibility waiver for air
transportation of explosives is contained in AFMAN 24-204. The following exceptions to the
above standards are permitted:
   8.7.1. Development of new items for transportation by combining previously hazard
   classified components into an increased state of assembly to meet a valid military need. Use
   normal hazard classification procedures (T.O. 11A-1-47) to obtain the hazard classification
   approval for transportation applicable to the new configuration.
   8.7.2. Movement of assembled or partially assembled explosive items between servicing
   explosives locations and aircraft loading points or other such locations on the same military
   installation, when the assembly has not been classed and approved as provided in T.O. 11A-
   1-47, but is necessary to meet valid operational requirements. If the operational requirement
   is expected to continue or can be anticipated, seek hazard classification approval.
   8.7.3. Movement in a military vehicle of minimum quantities of explosive items necessary
   for demolition operations, to include proficiency training. Blasting caps, demolition
   explosives and unserviceable (but not dangerously unserviceable) munitions may be
   transported by the same vehicle, provided MAJCOM approves the mixing of all applicable
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 149


   compatibility groups. See paragraph 8.22 for restrictions concerning the carrying of
   explosives inside passenger compartments.
   8.7.4. Transport dangerously unserviceable munitions in a separate military vehicle. If
   transport in a separate military vehicle is not possible, segregate and sandbag from other
   explosives being transported. Transport dangerously unserviceable munitions according to
   paragraph 8.11 provided the munitions have been determined safe for transportation by
   qualified personnel as specified by the MAJCOM.
   8.7.5. Movement by a DoD-owned vehicle, operated by DoD personnel, of mixed loads
   consisting of components (not otherwise compatible for transportation), in the numbers and
   of the types necessary to assemble a number of complete rounds of a single type, when
   essential to meet operational requirements, and when separate (unmixed) movement is not
   feasible. See DoD 4500.9R, Defense Transportation Regulation, for procedures where such
   exceptions to compatibility rules are required.
   8.7.6. Movement by a DoD-owned vehicle, operated by DoD personnel, or a mixed load of
   small quantities of items (not to exceed 1,000 pounds total NEWQD) from compatibility
   groups B through J, N, and S. The NEWQD of HD 1.4S items need not be included.
   8.7.7. Movement by Security Forces of mixed loads of ammunition in performance of their
   duties.
8.8. Compatibility of Explosives During Temporary Storage. Table 7.1, Title 49 CFR, or
AFMAN 24-204 criteria may be used for temporary mixing of explosives while undergoing
packing and unpacking operations or while in temporary storage awaiting shipment. Do not
store other dangerous articles with these explosives. Shipping, receiving and storage facilities
must comply with QD criteria of this Manual for the HD involved.

Section 8D—Packaging for Explosives Transportation

8.9. Packaging. Packaging of explosives offered for shipment must comply with T.O. 11A-1-
10, Title 49 CFR, Part 173, or AFMAN 24-204 specifications, as appropriate. Follow these
instructions:
   8.9.1. Locally made packaging must meet the construction and marking requirements in
   Title 49 CFR, or must conform with a military Certification of Equivalency for the item
   being packed.
   8.9.2. Mark each package to identify contents. The DOT marking consist of the Proper
   Shipping Name; United Nations Identification Number; and the EX-number, national stock
   number or other product code as specified in the hazard classification. See AFMAN 24-204,
   T.O. 11N-45-51, or the Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS), as appropriate. For
   Transportation Protective Service Material, mark in accordance with Defense Transportation
   Regulations and MIL-STD-129.
   8.9.3. If an item is not listed in above references, contact 505 CBSS/GBBA, Hill AFB UT
   84056-5609 for the required data.
   8.9.4. Do not open or repair a package in a railcar, motor vehicle, or aircraft unless it is
   essential for inflight safety or to safely unload a damaged package. Avoid re-nailing boxes
   because of the potential to strike the explosives with the nail.

AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                        161


   8.50.1. A competent representative will inspect railcars containing explosives at a designated
   inspection station. Inspection stations do not require explosives siting if they are limited to
   the activities described in paragraph 12.58. If the inspection station is also used as an
   explosives storage or suspect vehicle holding area, it must meet QD criteria per Chapter 12.
   The inspection station may be used as an interchange yard. Railcars should be removed
   promptly.
   8.50.2. Inspect the outside and underside of each car to detect damage (such as defective
   brakes, couplings, wheel flanges, or hot boxes) or unauthorized and suspicious articles.
   8.50.3. If pits are not available, conduct inspections from ground level. Provide pits if
   sabotage is possible.
   8.50.4. If rail traffic is heavy enough or in an emergency, a pit will help in inspecting and
   moving cars rapidly.
   8.50.5. Isolate cars of explosives for prompt corrective actions when foreign and suspicious
   articles have been attached outside or underneath the car. Also isolate when there is a defect
   that could affect installation safety or car contents.
       8.50.5.1. Move car, unless the problem prohibits, over the safest route to a location
       separated from other areas by proper inhabited building distances.
       8.50.5.2. Correct the unsatisfactory conditions before the car and cargo are released from
       the designated suspect car site, unless a determination is made that they are safe to move.
   8.50.6. Check individual car numbers and seal numbers against bills of lading. If the seal
   numbers on a car do not correspond to the numbers shown on the bill of lading, or a seal is
   not in place, treat as a suspect car. Remove it to the suspect car siting for additional
   inspection.
   8.50.7. Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo in cars that pass the initial
   inspection may be done at any suitable place, including the unloading point. Such cars may
   be considered reasonably safe. However, exercise care in breaking seals and opening doors
   because of the potential for shifted loads or leaking containers.
   8.50.8. If warranted by the inspection results, promptly remove cars from the inspection
   station.
   8.50.9. Externally inspect commercial carriers used to move explosives through a public
   access route, from one area to another area of the installation, before entering the second
   area. This is not needed if it is escorted or under surveillance enroute.
8.51. Rail Interchange Yards. This location will be used for the exchange of railcars between
the common carrier and the base activity involved. Interchange yards do not require explosives
siting if they are limited to the activities described in paragraph 12.59. If the inspection station is
also used as an explosives storage or suspect vehicle holding area, it must meet QD criteria per
Chapter 12. The interchange yard may be used as an inspection station. Railcars should be
removed promptly.
8.52. Rail Holding Yards. If explosives-loaded railcars cannot be dispatched to unloading
points promptly, they must be moved to a holding yard. See paragraph 12.60 for holding yard
siting requirements. Holding yards may be used for interchange and inspection activities.
 162                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


8.53. Rail Classification Yards. Where the volume of rail traffic necessitates, establish a
classification yard primarily for receiving, classifying, switching, and dispatching explosives-
laden railcars. Classification yards do not require explosives siting if they are limited to the
activities described in paragraph 12.61. If the classification yard is also used as an explosives
storage or suspect vehicle holding area, it must meet QD criteria per Chapter 12. The
classification yard may be used as an interchange yard. Railcars should be removed promptly.
8.54. Trailers on Flat Cars or Piggyback Explosives Loading and Unloading. The following
instructions govern use of explosives Trailers on Flat Cars (TOFC) railheads:
   8.54.1. Control loading or unloading operations to reduce exposures to a minimum.
   8.54.2. Quickly remove trailers from the railroad car and send at once to their destination or
   schedule for prompt loading on arrival at the site. If there is an unforeseen delay in loading
   or unloading, an explosives-loaded trailer may be kept at the site for a period not exceeding
   one working day.
   8.54.3. Don't open piggyback shipping trailers and containers at the site except for
   emergency or suspected emergency situations, except as for Shipping and Storage
   Containers, Ballistic Missile (SSCBM). SSCBM received by TOFC may be opened at the
   site for inspection and road transport preparation as required by pertinent T.O.s.
   8.54.4. Ensure adequate tie-down of trailers to railcars and blocking and bracing of
   explosives in the trailer. Cargo stability in transit is essential.
   8.54.5. Apply safety rules in this chapter on explosives-laden motor vehicles and their
   operation.
   8.54.6. The provisions of Bureau of Explosives Pamphlet 6C apply to explosives piggyback
   operations (the pamphlet lists railcars and hitches approved for TOFC service).
   8.54.7. Except for those just discussed, do not conduct operations on explosive items or
   explosives-laden containers, trailers, cars, etc., unless applicable QD criteria are met.

Section 8I—Transportation of Explosives by Air and Water

8.55. Transportation of Explosives by Air. Air transportation of explosives by commercial
aircraft is regulated by the DOT regulations that are incorporated into Title 49 CFR. Instructions
about explosives-laden military aircraft (and certain DoD contract airlift operations) are in AFJI
11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material, AFMAN 24-204,
Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, applicable aircraft T.O.s, and other
parts of this Manual. Transportation of impulse cartridges (HD 1.4 only) in aircraft travel pods
or bomber aircraft equipment bays is permitted if these cartridges are packed correctly in the
original DOT shipping containers. This procedure will be governed by locally approved
operating instructions IAW paragraph 7.2. More hazardous explosives (such as aircraft flares)
are not authorized by this Manual for this type of carriage. See guidance in paragraph 8.2 for
using NEWQD during transportation.
8.56. Transportation of Explosives by Water. Transportation of explosives and other
hazardous materials by water in vessels engaged in commercial service is regulated by the
United States Coast Guard. Shipments overseas must be made according to the regulations of
the carrier, the United States Coast Guard or the Department of the Army.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 163


                                          Chapter 9

      PROTECTION OF ELECTRO-EXPLOSIVE DEVICES FROM HAZARDS OF
           ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION TO ORDNANCE (HERO)

Section 9A—Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Electro-Explosive Devices

9.1. Chapter Overview. This chapter is consistent with Air Force policy under DoDD
3222.3_AFPD 33-5, DoD Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Program, paragraph
4.1.3, which states ―Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance HERO…shall be
mitigated prior to the conduct of all military exercises, operations, and activities.‖ It also
addresses the requirement in DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 2, HAZARDS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION TO ORDNANCE (HERO), that ―Military Munitions…shall be…protected such that
electromagnetic radiation (EMR) does not cause their inadvertent initiation, degradation or
disablement.‖ In addition to electro-explosive devices (EEDs) installed in ordnance and
ordnance components, the protective methods described in this chapter will be applicable to
individual EEDs, as well as all EEDs installed in aircraft. Throughout this chapter the term EED
can be used interchangeably with munitions or ordnance.
9.2. Conducted Electromagnetic Energy. Conducted electromagnetic energy is imposed on
circuits from other subsystems or sources by various methods. Examples are inductive or
capacitive coupling from other cabling, sneak ground circuits, defective components or wiring,
or errors in design. Protection of EEDs from conducted electromagnetic energy should be
designed into a weapons system as part of the system safety design process.

Section 9B—Definitions and Conversion Formulas

9.3. Antenna Gain (Gt). Antenna gain is a measure of the power channeled by a directional
antenna. It is usually provided in decibels (dB). Sometimes it is provided as a unitless number,
Gt. Use the following formula to convert between GdB and Gt:
             G 
G t  log 1  dB   10 G dB 10
              10 
9.4. EED Susceptibility Terms. Two types of EMR susceptibility can be defined for each
EED.
    9.4.1. Maximum No Fire Current (MNFC). The MNFC is a value statistically determined
    by experimental testing that quantifies the largest current amplitude that can be induced in
    the EED leads without initiating a reaction. The units for MNFC are usually milliamperes
    (mA).
    9.4.2. Maximum No Fire Power (MNFP). The MNFP is a value statistically determined
    by experimental testing that quantifies the largest power that can be absorbed by the EED
    without initiating a reaction. The units for MNFP are usually milliwatts (mW).
    9.4.3. Bridgewire Resistance. The two susceptibility values (above) are related by a third
    value with units of Ohms (
    resistance value. The MNFP is equal to the resistance multiplied by the MNFC squared. If
 164                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011



   to calculate the other value.
9.5. Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). The EIRP is equal to the actual transmitted
power level (Pt) multiplied by the antenna’s gain (Gt). The EIRP is defined as the amount of
power an emitter would have to transmit equally in all directions (isotropically; if Gt = 1) to
equal the power levels at the maximum point of the antenna pattern.
9.6. Electromagnetic Environment (EME). The EME is defined by the frequencies and power
levels the EED will be exposed to at a given location due to all known sources of EMR.
9.7. Far Field/Far Field Distance (Rff). The Far Field of an antenna is any location farther
from the antenna than the Far Field Distance. The Far Field Distance is the point where the
equations for the radiated electromagnetic field can be replaced with simpler equations and the
difference has dropped below a threshold margin of error accepted by engineers. The simpler
Far Field EMR equations describe a more consistent power density environment and the
propagation and coupling of the EMR to a receiving antenna is easier to apply to the EED
scenario.
   9.7.1. Use the greater resultant from the following formulas to determine where the far field
   begins:
                                     Rff = L2(f/c)

                                     Rff = 3(c/f)

       Rff = distance, in meters (or feet), from transmitting antenna where the far field begins
       L = largest dimension of the antenna, meters (or feet)
       f = frequency (Hz)
       c = speed of light, 3x108 m/s (or 984x106 ft/s)
   9.7.2. When the size or dimensions of the emitter aperture are not known, the following
   equation should be used to determine the worst-case aperture size:
         Gt
L  (c )
      f 2.8
9.8. Frequency (f). Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second. Use the
following formulas to convert between kHz (1000 Hz), MHz (1,000,000 Hz), and GHz
(1,000,000,000 Hz):
                                     1 kHz = 0.001 MHz
                                     1 GHz = 1000 MHz

9.9. HERO Certification. DoD 6055.09-M, defines HERO certification as ―exposure, without
adverse effects, of the munitions to the electromagnetic environment (EME) relevant to all life
cycle configurations, including packaging, handling, storage, transportation, checkout, loading
and unloading, and launch.‖ This definition is dependent on the EME and the configurations of
the munitions during operations.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     165


9.10. HERO Classifications. Three possible HERO Classifications are available. The choice of
classification is based upon the EED’s susceptibilities to EMR, the configuration of the EED,
and the EME the EED will experience during the planned operational event. The EME for EIDs
is given in MIL-STD-464C, paragraph 5.9.3. and tables 9 and 10. HERO Classification is a
temporary label used only to determine the proper procedures to follow to achieve the level of
protection the EED requires to safely complete the planned operations.
   9.10.1. HERO SAFE. If the EED is incapable of being initiated by EMR in its expected
   EME, either by design or by shielding, the EED shall be classified as HERO SAFE and no
   further protection is necessary.
   9.10.2. HERO SUSCEPTIBLE. If the EED could potentially be initiated by EMR in its
   expected EME, the EED shall be classified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE and protective efforts
   are required.
   9.10.3. HERO UNSAFE. If susceptibility data for the EED is known to be less than the
   values used to establish the ―worst-case‖ protective requirements (54mW MNFP and/or less
   than 85mA MNFC), the EED shall be classified as HERO UNSAFE and additional
   protective efforts are required. Examples of HERO UNSAFE EEDs include items not
   classified as SAFE or SUSCEPTIBLE, those with internal wiring exposed, items with
   exposed wire leads when handled in untested conditions, items being assembled or
   disassembled, and items with damage causing exposure of internal wiring.
9.11. Modern Mobile Emitters (MME). The term MME is used to describe all RF emitters
that have the capability of moving with regard to the location of the EED, as well as any other
low power emitters that are part of modern communication and data systems that include mobile
emitters. This potentially invalidates the ―far-field‖ approximations used to simplify the radiation
theory and coupling models used when EMR safety requirements were analyzed with regard to
these emitters. This category includes cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),
barcode readers and RFID devices, wireless computers and network access points, and any other
transmitter that can potentially be brought close to EEDs, even to distances less than the emitter
antenna’s far-field distance
9.12. Near Field. The Near Field of an antenna is any location closer to the antenna than the
Far Field Distance. In the Near Field, the equations for the radiated electromagnetic field must
be used without simplification and calculating the coupling of EMR to a receiving antenna
becomes very complicated and difficult. For example, in the Near Field of an aperture antenna,
there is a reduction of antenna gain that can possibly provide some safe separation distance
(SSD) relief, however, in the Near Field of a dipole antenna, there is an increase in antenna gain
that increases the SSD. For a more detailed explanation of near-field calculations, see TO 31Z-
10-4, Air Force EMR Hazard Program (Chapter 6, Section II, Calculating Power Density and
Hazard Distance).
9.13. Safe Separation Distance (SSD). The SSD is the calculated distance from an emitter
beyond which the radiated power density from that emitter has decreased to a level which is too
low to couple enough energy into an EED to initiate detonation. Measurement of the SSD may
take into account the vertical difference in height between the emitter and the EED or weapon
meant to be protected.
 166                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


9.14. Traditional Fixed-Location Emitters (TFE). The term TFE is used to describe all RF
emitters that have been traditionally tracked by the Installation Spectrum Manager. These
emitters are in a fixed location, usually mounted on a tower, mast or rooftop, and usually radiate
a fairly high EIRP, hundreds if not thousands of Watts. These features often allow the
application of ―far-field‖ approximations to simplify the radiation theory and the application of
coupling models when EMR safety requirements are being analyzed with regard to these
emitters.
9.15. Transmitted Power (Pt). Transmitted power, Pt, is expressed in Watts (W). For
continuous systems, the peak radiated power should be used. For pulsed systems, calculate Pt as
follows:
               Pt = Ppk x PW x PRF
               Ppk = Peak radiated power, in Watts
               PW = Pulse Width, the duration of the pulse, in seconds
               PRF = Pulse Repetition Frequency, the number of pulses transmitted each second,
                       in Hz (1/sec)

Section 9C—HERO Protection Overview

9.16. Radiated Electromagnetic Energy. EEDs are typically designed to be initiated by low
levels of electrical energy injected directly into the lead wires of the device. As such, they are
susceptible to unintentional ignition by many forms of direct or induced electrical energy, such
as from lightning discharges, static electricity, or the coupling of radio frequency (RF) energy
into the lead wires. This RF energy can be transmitted by ground based or airborne emitters
(antennas), both from fixed or mobile locations, and at a range of power levels and frequencies
that can vary over several orders of magnitude. Once transmitted, EMR propagates at the speed
of light and all electrically conducting objects in its path can potentially act as receiving antennas
for this energy.
9.17. EMR Protection Information. The only way to guarantee protection of an EED from the
hazards of EMR is to ensure that the EED is never located where the RF power density is
sufficiently high to couple enough electrical energy into the device to initiate detonation. This
seemingly simple prescription involves knowing several critical pieces of information: the RF
power density present, the capability of the energy to couple into the EED, and the threshold
energy required to put the EED at risk for initiation. This information is in turn dependent on the
type of EED under consideration, the specific location of the EED, the configuration of the EED,
and the operational tasks being performed. The complexity and layered nature of this information
quickly complicates the protection process.
9.18. EMR Information Categories. All the information required to guarantee the protection
of EEDs from EMR hazards can be organized into five categories of knowledge, depicted in
Figure 9.1.
   9.18.1. Category A. The location, frequency, transmitting power levels and transmitting
   pattern (gain) of all antennas that could potentially affect the EED.
   9.18.2. Category B. The fundamentals of radiation theory.
   9.18.3. Category C. The coupling models used to describe the interaction of EMR with the
   EEDs.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  167


   9.18.4. Category D. The susceptibility of the EEDs and their physical configuration when
   protection efforts are being considered.
   9.18.5. Category E. The location where the operations are planned

Figure 9.1. Categories of EMR Information involved in protecting EEDs.




9.19. Use of EMR Information. The information in Categories A, D and E are the only ones
over which the operator will have any level of control, so they will be the primary focus of this
document. The Category B and C information has been predetermined by the universe we live in.
However, these theories and models can and have been analyzed and applied to HERO situations
using conservative approximations that simplify them to the point of being useful and fairly easy
to understand. While a few of these fundamental concepts are reviewed in this document, they
are presented in much more detail in other publications, including TO 31Z-10-4, Air Force EMR
Hazard Program (Chapter 3, Section III, EED Hazards and Chapter 6, Section I, RF Propagation,
and Section II, Calculating Power Density and Hazard Distance).

Section 9E—Emitter Categories and Assumptions

9.26. Traditional Fixed-Location Emitter (TFE) Analysis. The application of radiation
theory and coupling models have historically been based on a few underlying assumptions.
Emitters that meet these key assumptions will be referred to as Traditional Fixed-Location
Emitters (TFEs).
   9.26.1. There are two basic assumptions for most RF emitters that need to be considered for
   EED safety.
       9.26.1.1. The emitters are in a fixed location, usually mounted on a tower, mast or
       rooftop.
       9.26.1.2. The emitters are radiating a fairly high power level; hundreds if not thousands
       of Watts.
   9.26.2. These assumptions allow the application of ―far-field‖ approximations to simplify
   the radiation theory and coupling models when EMR safety requirements are analyzed. The
   resulting EMR safety requirements for EEDs were simplified to the calculation of a ―Safe
   Separation Distance (SSD),‖ often hundreds of feet.
   9.26.3. The choice of equations used to calculate the SSD for a TFE depends on the HERO
   classification of the EED (see paragraph 9.28.1), the frequency of the transmitted RF energy
   and the total EIRP of the emitter. Different equations are required for different operations
   because safety threshold levels vary depending on the configuration of the EED (see Table
   9.1).
   9.26.4. If this minimum distance (SSD) is maintained between the EED and the emitter, then
   the RF power density at the location of the EED, even under the most optimal transmission
   and the most efficient coupling conditions, will be too low to provide sufficient energy to
   initiate the EED.
   9.26.5. HERO protection for EEDs will continue to follow this approach for TFEs.
9.27. Modern Mobile Emitter (MME) Analysis. The validity of the traditional approach for
SSD determination (see paragraph 9.26) has come under increased scrutiny as the proliferation of
low-power, mobile data and communications systems has undermined the assumptions at the
foundation of that approach.
   9.27.1. Cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), barcode readers, RFID devices,
   wireless computers and network access points transmit at much lower power levels than
   more conventional emitters (TFEs), but they can also be brought much closer to EEDs, even
   into the near field of their antennas.
   9.27.2. All low power, mobile emitters, and any low power fixed-location emitters that are
   part of the same system, will be referred to as Modern Mobile Emitters (MMEs).
   9.27.3. While this is not an entirely new hazard for EEDs, it does require a new approach for
   analyzing and calculating SSDs and related safety requirements (see paragraph 9.30).
   9.27.4. When unsure of the classification for an emitter, assistance should be requested (see
   paragraph 9.32).

Section 9F—Methods for Protecting EEDs from EMR Hazards

9.28. TFE Safety Procedures for Conventional Weapons and Individual EEDs. The
following steps outline the procedures for insuring the EMR from a Traditional Fixed-location
Emitter does not cause inadvertent EED initiation. This is done by maintaining a Safe
Separation Distance (SSD) between the emitter and the EED.
   9.28.1. Preparation and HERO Classification.
       9.28.1.1. The following information shall be collected and reviewed prior to performing
       any operation involving conventional weapons or individual EEDs.
          9.28.1.1.1. The configurations of the EED during the planned operation shall be
          determined.
          9.28.1.1.2. When available, the susceptibilities of the EED in these configurations
          shall be obtained.
          9.28.1.1.3. The EME at the location of the planned operations shall be determined.
          This information should be available from the ISM or the BSO.
       9.28.1.2. Once this information has been collected, the HERO classification applicable to
       the EED for the planned operations can be determined as one of the three possibilities
       listed below. The EME for EIDs is given in MIL-STD-464C, paragraph 5.9.3. and tables
       9 and 10. These HERO designations apply only to the planned operation that was
       analyzed. Any change in the operation, the EME or the EED’s configuration will require
       reassessment of the HERO classification.
          9.28.1.2.1. HERO SAFE. If the EED has been determined, by previously conducted
          engineering and scientific analysis, to be incapable of being initiated by EMR in the
          planned configuration and the expected EME, the EED shall be classified as HERO
          SAFE and no further protection from TFEs is necessary.
          9.28.1.2.2. HERO SUSCEPTIBLE. If the EED is vulnerable to possible initiation
          by EMR in the planned configuration and the expected EME, the EED shall be
          classified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE and protective efforts are required (see
          paragraph 9.28.2.2).
          9.28.1.2.3. HERO UNSAFE. If susceptibility data for the EED in the planned
          configuration is available and the sensitivities of the EED are less than 54mW MNFP
          and/or less than 85mA MNFC, the EED shall be classified as HERO UNSAFE and
          additional protective efforts are required (see paragraph 9.28.2.3).
   9.28.2. Determining Protection Requirements.
       9.28.2.1. For EEDs classified as HERO SAFE no further protection from TFEs is
       necessary in its expected EME (for information about protection from MMEs, see
       paragraph 9.30).
       9.28.2.2. For EEDs classified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, an SSD from each known TFE
       shall be determined using Table 9.1 and the expected configuration of the EED. The
       planned operations must be located at a distance greater than the SSD from each TFE.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  171


     9.28.2.3. For EEDs classified as HERO UNSAFE, assistance shall be requested to
     determine the protection requirements necessary (see paragraph 9.32).
     9.28.2.4. If any of the calculated SSDs are too large for the planned operations, and if the
     specific susceptibility values for the EED are known, a new distance can be calculated
     using software available from the Joint Spectrum Center and AFSC/SEW (see paragraph
     9.33).
     9.28.2.5. Approximate calculations for the safe separation distances for EEDs in
     conventional munitions can also be made using the nomographs in Figure 9.2 and Figure
     9.4.
     9.28.2.6. Additional safety criteria are required if MMEs are present for munitions
     regardless of HERO classification. See paragraph 9.30 for guidance.
     9.28.2.7. Examples of safe separation distance calculations for TFEs:
        9.28.2.7.1. Scenario:
     Condition of EED: HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, Exposed
     Transmitter frequency = 300 MHz
     Average transmitter power = 1000 watts
     Antenna gain = 15dB
        9.28.2.7.2. Using Table 9.1:
     Step 1. Find the proper configuration and formula from Table 9.1.

     Since the EED is exposed and the frequency is 300 MHz, the applicable formula is:

        448.625 
     D          Pt G t   ft
           f    

     Step 2. Determine PtGt where

     Pt = 1000 watts (given),
     GdB = 15
     Gt = log -1 (GdB/10) = 31.6:
     PtGt = (1000) (31.6) = 31,600 Watts

     Step 3. Substitute these values into the formula:

        448.625 
     D          31600  266 ft
        300 
        9.28.2.7.3. Using Figure 9.2:
     Step 1. Mark the point where 300 MHz lies on the frequency scale.

     Step 2. Determine the effective radiated power (ERP) by multiplying PtGt where

     Pt = 1000 watts (given)
 172                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       Gt = log-1 (GdB/10) = log-1 (15/10) = log-1 1.5 ( or Gt = 31.6):
       PtGt = (1000) (31.6) = 31,600 watts.

       Mark this spot on the effective radiated power scale.

       Step 3. Draw a straight line through the points established in steps 1 and 2 to the distance
       scale. (see Figure 9.3) The recommended SSD, about 260 feet, is read where the line
       intersects the distance scale.
9.29. TFE Safety Procedures for Nuclear Weapons. The following steps outline the
procedures for insuring the EMR from a Traditional Fixed-location Emitter does not cause
inadvertent EED initiation. This is done by maintaining a Safe Separation Distance (SSD)
between the emitter and the EED.
   9.29.1. Preparation/Planning.
       9.29.1.1. The following information shall be collected and reviewed prior to performing
       any operations involving nuclear weapons.
          9.29.1.1.1. The configurations of the nuclear weapon during the planned operation
          must be determined.
          9.29.1.1.2. The EME at the location of the planned operations shall be determined.
          This information should be available from the ISM or the BSO.
   9.29.2. Determining Protection Requirements.
       9.29.2.1. The SSD from each known TFE shall be determined using Table 9.2 and the
       configuration of the weapon. The planned operations must be conducted at locations
       greater than the SSD for each TFE.
       9.29.2.2. Additional safety criteria are required if MMEs are present. See paragraph 9.30
       for guidance.
9.30. MME Safety Procedures and Considerations. If any commercial, common-use
transmitters fitting the category of MMEs are present in the location where EED operations are
planned, the following additional guidelines shall be applied.
   9.30.1. Base and Command Safety Offices may require separation distances for individual
   categories of MMEs greater than those listed in this paragraph. However, they may not
   allow the use of MMEs at distances less than the values listed below without AFSC/SEW
   approval (see Section 9H).
   9.30.2. General Assumptions. Most of the emitters considered MMEs are governed by the
   Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
   Title 47. Common, commercially obtained sources of RF energy, such as cellular phones,
   remote key fobs, etc., are normally governed for emission levels by FCC Part 15 or Part 22
   and are identified accordingly. If compliance cannot be ascertained via markings on the
   device or within the owner’s/user’s manual, or if the planned operations occur outside
   CONUS where FCC regulations are not applicable, assistance should be requested (see
   paragraph 9.32).
   9.30.3. ―Worst-Case‖ Assumptions. All guidance for MMEs is based on the same ―worst
   case‖ assumptions for EED susceptibility; MNFC = 85mA, MNFP = 54mW and an
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  173


   additional ―firing consequence factor‖ of -16.5dB. If the EED involved is known to have
   susceptibilities below these values or if the MME performance exceeds any of the Pt or Gt
   values listed below, assistance should be requested (see paragraph 9.32).
   9.30.4. The transmission of modern mobile emitters is not authorized within 10 feet of any
   exposed EED, or any weapon system containing an EED except for those items specifically
   listed below and those specific items that have been individually researched and addressed in
   writing by AFSC/SEW. When a lesser distance is allowed, MMEs should still be kept at
   least 10 feet away whenever possible. Using any emitter closer than 10 feet should only take
   place if required for the proper use of the transmitting device or if required to complete the
   planned and approved operations, and is not justified by issues of convenience or for the sole
   purpose of ease of operations.
       9.30.4.1. Cellular telephones. The SSD for all cellular telephones is 10 ft from all
       EEDs, regardless of configuration. This guidance assumes all cellular phones are in
       compliance with Title 47 CFR 22.905 which defines the allowable frequency range for
       cellular phones as 824 MHz to 849 MHz and Title 47 CFR 22.913 which requires a
       maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 7 Watts.
       9.30.4.2. Radio Frequency Identification/Automatic Identification Technology
       (RFID/AIT) Devices. All HERO issues for RFID and AIT devices are being addressed
       by the Product Manager Joint-Automatic Identification Technology Office (PM J-AIT).
       The PM J-AIT is HERO certifying RFID and AIT equipment for near field operation
       using ―worst case‖ guidance limitations. All SSDs calculated, approved and published by
       PM J-AIT for individual pieces of equipment applicable to munitions operations may be
       considered approved and shall be observed. Contact AFSC/SEWN for a current list of
       approved AIT devices.
       9.30.4.3. Wireless Computer Network Equipment. The SSD for all wireless
       equipment is 2.5 ft from all EEDs, regardless of configuration. This guidance assumes
       all wireless computer network cards, wireless network access points, personal digital
       assistants, and any other similar devices present are in compliance with Title 47 CFR
       15.247 which requires all wireless equipment has a maximum EIRP of 4 Watts,
       transmission is at or above 2.4GHz, and antennas have a maximum gain of 6dBi.
       9.30.4.4. Remote Keyless Entry Devices. The SSD for all remote keyless entry devices
       (also known as ―key fobs‖) is 0.5 ft from all EEDs, regardless of configuration. This
       guidance assumes all these devices are in compliance with Title 47 CFR 15.231.
   9.30.5. If the operator is unsure if a device should be defined as an MME or if the operator
   has an MME device of a type not specifically addressed in this section, assistance should be
   requested (see paragraph 9.32). AFSC/SEW will analyze and distribute information
   regarding decisions, approved use guidelines and SSD calculations for specific devices on a
   case-by-case basis.
9.31. Maximum Power Density Criteria. When the minimum safe separation distances cannot
be achieved, because of lack of real estate or any other limitations, a power density and field
intensity survey should be made at the location where the operations are planned to occur.
   9.31.1. Compare the measured power density with the recommended maximum power
   density calculated from Table 9.1 for conventional munitions or Table 9.2 for nuclear
 174                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   weapons. The measured power density must be no greater than the maximum power density
   provided in the table.
   9.31.2. Example of power density calculation:
       9.31.2.1. Scenario:
       Condition of EED: HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, in nonmetallic container
       Actual measured power density = 450 W/m2
       Frequency = 200 MHz
       9.31.2.2. Using Table 9.1:
       Step 1. Find the proper column and formula in Table 9.1.
       Since the frequency is 200 MHz, the proper formula to determine maximum safe power
       density is:
                       2
                  f  W
       Po  10       
                  485  m 2

       Step 2. Solve the equation:

                      2
                  200  W        W
       Po  10             1.7 2
                  485  m 2
                                  m

       Step 3. Compare the maximum safety power density to the actual measured power
       density.
       The EED is being exposed to 450 W/m2.
       The maximum safe power density is 1.7 W/m2.
       This situation is unacceptable.

Section 9G—Assistance for EMR Analyses

9.32. Assistance Requests. When a hazardous situation is suspected or the minimum safe
separation distances for a particular location are in question, request assistance from
MAJCOM/SEW personnel. When classification of an emitter as a TFE or an MME is unclear or
the use of an MME is desired but not specifically referenced in paragraph 9.30.4, request
assistance from AFSC/SEW personnel.
   9.32.1. MAJCOM/SEW personnel may request assistance from AFSC/SEW.
   9.32.2. Assistance requests must include all information needed for a complete
   understanding of the situation. Minimum requirements are:
       9.32.2.1. Category A Information.
          9.32.2.1.1. Operating frequencies, pulse widths, pulse repetition frequencies, peak
          power and average power of each transmitter.
          9.32.2.1.2. Gain characteristics (main and sidelobe), focal length, largest dimension,
          scan characteristics (rates, dwell times, angles, etc.), and height above the ground for
          each antenna.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                           175


       9.32.2.2. Category D Information. Type of aircraft, ordnance, and applicable EED
       involved, along with available characteristics of EED (no-fire power or energy levels).
       9.32.2.3. Category E Information. Base layout and contour map of the area. Show
       transportation routes of EED and ordnance subsystems, location of ordnance and EED
       maintenance, storage, and assembly and disassembly areas, and location of all
       transmitting antennas.
   9.32.3. Decisions will be sent to the originating base or command, with information copies
   sent to all agencies involved in the decision process, and an additional copy to AFSC/SEW,
   if applicable.
9.33. Software Tool. The Joint Spectrum Center has an automated EMR analyses process using
a software tool titled Maximum Allowable Environment Analysis Program. This software can
generate charts for determining the maximum power density and Safe Separation Distance based
on specific antenna characteristics and known EED susceptibility values. The reasoning and
decision to use any SSD calculated with this software program shall be documented in local
procedural instructions. Copies of this software are available from AFSC/SEWN.

Section 9H—Deviations to EMR Requirements

9.34. Deviations to EMR Requirements. Use the criteria in this chapter unless a deviation has
been authorized for a given hazard in accordance with paragraph 1.4. If a deviation to the
guidance given in this chapter has been authorized, take the following action as appropriate:
   9.34.1. When the findings apply to a given weapon system, piece of equipment, or explosive
   item, the applicable weapons system or other TO must be changed to include the criteria.
   The agency requesting assistance will notify the command and activity responsible for the
   TO of the required changes, with information copies to all concerned parties.
   9.34.2. When circumstances make it appropriate, details of the situation and the authority
   and basis of the approved criteria will appear in permanent base or unit publications.

Notes for Table 9.1:
1. For the formulas in this table:
f = frequency (MHz)
Pt = transmitter power (W); calculate Pt as defined in paragraph 9.15.
Gt = antenna gain (see paragraph 9.3 to convert from GdB)
Power Density conversion: 10 W/m2 = 1 mW/cm2.

2. When more than one transmitter is operating in an area, each at a different frequency, the
maximum allowable power density is the greatest power density calculated for each of the
transmitters.

3. Formulas in this table apply to the far field of the antenna only. Far field is determined as
stipulated in paragraph 9.7. For near field requirements, see TO31Z-10-4, Air Force EMR
Hazard Program (Chapter 6, Section II).

4. For frequencies outside the ranges specified in this table, assistance should be requested (see
paragraph 9.32).

below personnel exposure limits as specified in AFOSHSTD 48-9, ―Radio Frequency Radiation
(RFR) Safety Program,‖ additional guidance should be reviewed for operations involving EEDs
―In Storage or Ground Transport in a Non-Metallic Container,‖ for EEDs ―In Storage or Ground
Transport in a Metallic Container,‖or for EEDs ―In or On an Aircraft‖.

6. Configuration Descriptions:

Worst-Case. When EEDs are unshielded, or the leads or circuitry could inadvertently be formed
into a resonant dipole or loop antenna, or the configuration of the EEDs is unknown.

Exposed EED. When EEDs are exposed due to maintenance, assembly, or disassembly or the
item or munition which contains the EED is exposed due to maintenance, assembly, or
disassembly.

EEDs in Storage or Ground Transport in a Non-Metallic Container. When EEDs are stored or in
a ground transport configuration inside a non-conductive (non-metallic) container such as wood
or plastic.

EEDs in Storage or Ground Transport in a Metallic Container. When EEDs are stored or in a
ground transport configuration inside a conductive (metallic) container. This includes EEDs
assembled in a weaponized configuration when the weapon case provides a conductive shield.

EEDs In or On an Aircraft. When EEDs or the item or munition containing them are in a
transport configuration inside cargo aircraft or externally loaded on an aircraft.

Leadless EEDs. When EEDs don’t have lead wires and are in original shipping configurations
and/or containers.

7. When handling or installing EEDs, use ―Exposed EED‖ configuration even though leadless
EEDs are involved, since weapon systems wiring could form a resonant antenna during
installation.

8. When unclear about the appropriate configuration to apply, use the most conservative, i.e., the
greatest distance or largest power density.

9. Approximate calculations for the safe separation distances for EEDs in conventional
munitions can also be made using the nomographs in Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.4

                                           Chapter 10

        FIREFIGHTING, EMERGENCY PLANNING AND FIRE PREVENTION

Section 10A—Hazard Identification for Firefighting and Emergency Planning

10.1. Scope and Applicability.
   10.1.1. This section establishes standard firefighting hazard identification measures to ensure
   a minimum practicable risk in fighting fires involving AE. These identification measures are
   based on the classification of AE fires into four fire divisions according to their predominant
   hazard.
   10.1.2. AE hazard symbols and supplemental symbols including chemical agent symbols
   (see paragraph 10.4) are for firefighting situations.
10.2. Fire Divisions. There are four fire divisions. Fire division 1 indicates the greatest hazard.
The hazard decreases with ascending fire division numbers from 1 to 4, and are related to HD as
shown in Table 10.1. The hazard is based on the burning or explosives characteristics of the
material. Fire symbols do not apply to liquid propellants, except for symbol 1, which is used to
indicate a detonation hazard of Group IV propellant. Fire protection for insensitive high
explosives (both bulk and filled items) is based on their equivalent storage classification.
10.3. Fire Division Symbols.
   10.3.1. The four fire divisions are represented by four distinctive symbols so that firefighting
   personnel can recognize the hazards. A fire division number is shown on each symbol. For
   the purpose of identifying these symbols from long range, the symbols differ in shape as
   shown in Figure 10.1.
   10.3.2. The shape and dimensions of the symbols are shown in Figure 10.1. This shape and
   color scheme is consistent with the requirements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO), United Nations Organization (UNO), and International Maritime Organization
   (IMO).
10.4. Chemical Agent and Chemical Munition Hazard Symbols.
   10.4.1. The storage of chemical agents and chemical munitions requires the use of chemical
   hazard symbols. These symbols (see Figures 10.2 and 10.3) will be used in conjunction with
   fire symbols, where appropriate. Some of the common chemical agents used in AE, the CG
   of that AE, and the chemical hazard symbols required in storage are specified in Table 10.2.
   10.4.2. The following sections describe these symbols, the hazards indicated by the symbols,
   and the recommended protective clothing and equipment to be used for fighting fires
   involving these chemical agents and chemical munitions. Where respiratory protection
   (SCBA and protective masks) are used, personnel must implement a workplace respiratory
   protection program IAW AFOSH Std 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program. (Reference
   the item T.O., or contact Bioenvironmental Engineering for protective clothing requirements
   for situations other than firefighting. The self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and
   other protective clothing and equipment prescribed in this paragraph must be used if required
   for use by other applicable technical orders or other Department of Defense or Air Force
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                               183


  publications. See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning
  and Operations for further guidance.)
     10.4.2.1. Set 1 of Chemical Hazard Symbol 1 requires full protective clothing (see
     Figure 10.2 and Table 10.2) and indicates the presence of highly toxic chemical agents
     that may cause death or serious damage to body functions. The following full protective
     clothing will be used: Level A encapsulating suit IAW T.O. 14P3-1-7, Toxicological
     Protective Apron, M-2.
        10.4.2.1.1. SCBA.
        10.4.2.1.2. Impermeable suit.
        10.4.2.1.3. Impermeable hood.
        10.4.2.1.4. Impermeable boots.
        10.4.2.1.5. Impermeable undergarments.
        10.4.2.1.6. Impermeable coveralls.
        10.4.2.1.7. Impermeable protective footwear.
        10.4.2.1.8. Impermeable gloves.
     10.4.2.2. Set 2 of Chemical Hazard Symbol 1 requires full protective clothing (see
     Figure 10.2 and Table 10.2) and indicates the presence of harassing agents (riot control
     agents and smokes). The following protective clothing will be used:
        10.4.2.2.1. Protective gas masks or SCBA.
        10.4.2.2.2. Permeable coveralls.
        10.4.2.2.3. Protective gloves.
        10.4.2.2.4. Firefighting personnel equipped with normal heat-resistant clothing (e.g.,
        bunker suit) and gas mask or SCBA do not require the set 2 protective clothing.
     10.4.2.3. Set 3 of Chemical Hazard Symbol 1 requires full protective clothing (see
     Figure 10.2 and Table 10.2) and indicates the presence of white phosphorous (WP) or
     other spontaneously combustible material. The following protective clothing will be
     used:
        10.4.2.3.1. Protective gas masks or SCBA.
        10.4.2.3.2. Flameresistant coveralls.
        10.4.2.3.3. Flameresistant gloves.
        10.4.2.3.4. Firefighting personnel equipped with normal heat-resistant clothing (e.g.,
        bunker suit) and gas mask or SCBA do not require the set 3 protective clothing.
     10.4.2.4. Chemical Hazard Symbol 2 requires the wearing of breathing apparatus (see
     Figure 10.2 and Table 10.2) and indicates the presence of incendiary or readily
     flammable chemical agents that present an intense radiant heat hazard. Protective masks
     will be used to prevent inhalation of smoke from burning incendiary mixtures.

       10.4.2.5. Chemical Hazard Symbol 3 warns against applying water (see Figure 10.2 and
       Table 10.2) and indicates a dangerous reaction will occur if water is used in an attempt to
       extinguish fire.
10.5. Obtaining Firefighting Symbol Decals. Decals for fire and chemical hazard symbols
may be obtained through normal Air Force supply channels. National stock numbers (NSN) of
standard and half-size decals are listed in Figures 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3. Make backing for fire
symbol decals the shape of the decal and out of non-combustible material. If heat from the fire
burns off the numbers, the fire department can act on the shape. AFVA 91-216, USAF
Explosives Fire and Chemical Hazard Symbols, is available through publication channels.

Section 10B—Posting Firefighting Symbols

10.6. Purpose of Posting Firefighting Symbols. Firefighting symbols are used as a back-up
precaution for alerting response personnel to explosives or chemicals present. Firefighting
symbols posted on nuclear, chemical, or conventional weapon storage sites will comply with
paragraph 10.7, unless otherwise directed by the Base Fire Chief (direction must be in writing).
These written directions notify personnel that local conditions (e.g., security considerations) may
make it undesirable to identify munitions with fire symbols at the actual storage locations.
10.7. Posting Requirements for Firefighting Symbols.
   10.7.1. Post the fire symbol and chemical symbol that applies to the most hazardous material
   present at non-nuclear explosives locations.
   10.7.2. When non-class 1 hazardous items or materials are stored or used in a facility,
   without other items of class 1, identify the predominant hazard to guide emergency response
   personnel. In this case, placards are required in accordance with NFPA and OSHA
   regulations. (Do not display NFPA and OSHA placards concurrently with class 1 fire
   symbols.)
   10.7.3. Post firefighting symbols when AE or chemical agents are placed in a facility or
   location, and remove the symbols when the AE or chemical agents are removed. The person
   in charge of the operation is responsible for posting or changing the symbols.
   10.7.4. Notify the Emergency Communication Center (ECC) each time firefighting symbols
   are changed.
   10.7.5. Half-sized symbols may be used on doors or lockers inside buildings.
   10.7.6. Licensed Explosives Storage Locations.
       10.7.6.1. Post symbols on exterior and interior entrances to small rooms licensed for
       storing AE.

Section 10C—Firefighting Measures and Withdrawal Distances

10.9. Firefighting Measures.
   10.9.1. Fires involving conventional munitions cannot be definitized to any one set of
   circumstances and environmental conditions. This precludes development of reliable
   standardized test criteria and reliable specific item fire fighting and withdrawal times. The
   conclusion to be reached from available data is that a munitions reaction to fire is a function
   of case thickness and type of explosive filler which can be varied by environmental
 186                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   conditions. Since the circumstances of a fire cannot be predicted, specific item by item fire
   fighting and withdrawal times cannot be determined with any degree of reliability.
   10.9.2. Firefighters shall have a thorough knowledge of the hazards associated with AE fires
   and expected AE reactions. The firefighting forces and other essential personnel will be
   briefed before approaching the scene of the fire. They will be informed of the known
   hazards and conditions existing at the fire scene prior to proceeding to the fire location.
   10.9.3. Fires involving AE will be fought according to the HD, fire division, the progression
   of the fire, and the procedures specified in this Manual.
   10.9.4. All fires starting in the vicinity of ammunition or explosives shall be reported and
   fought immediately with all available means to prevent the spreading of fire and munitions
   involvement. However, if fire engulfs explosives material or is supplying heat to it, or if the
   fire is so large that it cannot be extinguished with the equipment on hand, personnel involved
   shall evacuate and seek safety. See table 10.1 for additional information and when required,
   evacuate personnel per paragraph 10.10.
10.10. Fire Withdrawal Distances. Commanders are responsible for developing evacuation
plans that include the applicable withdrawal distances as part of the installation’s emergency
planning (see paragraph 10.13).
   10.10.1. Non-essential personnel. These emergency withdrawal distances apply in
   emergency situations only and are not to be used for facility explosives siting.
       10.10.1.1. The initial withdrawal distance for non-essential personnel will be at least
       IBD for the PES involved. If the fire involves AE, AE involvement is imminent, or the
       fire is or may become uncontrollable, then use the fire withdrawal distances listed in
       Table 10.3. The fire withdrawal distances depend on fire involvement and on whether or
       not the HD, fire division and quantity of explosives are known.
       10.10.1.2. Structures or protected locations offering equivalent protection for the
       distances in Table 10.3 may be used in lieu of relocating personnel from the structure or
       location to the specified fire withdrawal distance.
   10.10.2. Essential personnel. Emergency authorities on-site will determine who qualify as,
   and the withdrawal distance for, essential personnel at accidents.
   10.10.3. Chemical Agents. AE containing both explosives and chemical agents (see Table
   10.2) requires special attention and precautions in firefighting. Fires involving such AE will
   be fought in accordance with their fire division characteristics. Responding personnel must
   consider the additional hazards and precautions for the chemical agents involved.
   10.10.4. Underground Explosives Facilities. Entry to underground explosives facilities
   following a fire or explosion requires special precautions. Emergency personnel will monitor
   for the presence of toxic fumes or oxygen depleted atmospheres, and will evaluate structural
   damage during initial entry following an accident. Commanders will develop written
   procedures that define actions in such emergency situations (see paragraph 10.13).
   10.10.5. Nuclear Weapons. Nuclear weapons fire withdrawal distances are listed in T.O.
   11N-20-11, General Fire Fighting Guidance.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                         187


10.11. Improvised Explosive Device Withdrawal Distances. Withdraw all non-essential
personnel in accordance with AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual. Personnel shall be behind or
under cover. Withdraw to the following MINIMUM distances: 500 feet if the IED is a small
item or box (up to 2 cu ft), 1,000 feet if the IED is a barrel or car (up to 15 cu ft), 1,500 feet if the
IED is a van or truck, or 2,000 feet and beyond if the IED is a vehicle larger than already
described. Responding command authorities and EOD teams will evaluate and adjust these
distances if needed. Distances are for initial evacuation until command authorities and EOD
teams evaluate the incident.
10.12. Withdrawal Distances for AE Not Involved in Fire. The initial decision to evacuate
non-essential personnel will be based on the type of AE involved and its susceptibility to become
more unstable, armed, or hazardous. Good judgment, with regards to protecting personnel from
the hazards of the AE or surrounding area, must be exercised. When evacuation is considered
necessary, or is required by other technical guidance, clear the area to a distance of 300 feet (125
feet for simulators and smoke producing devices). Withdrawal distances may be adjusted by the
incident commander.

Section 10D—Emergency Planning

10.13. Emergency Planning. Commanders will develop an emergency management plan
designed to provide safety, security, and environmental protection for accidents involving AE.
Plans will be coordinated with the applicable federal, state, and local emergency response
authorities (e.g., law enforcement, fire departments, hospitals, etc.) and any established Local
Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC). In addition to requirements prescribed in AFI 10-
2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, the plan will
include the following:
    10.13.1. Specific sections and guidance that address withdrawal distances, emergency
    preparedness, contingency planning, and security. The developed EM plan will limit access
    to accident sites to trained and authorized personnel.
    10.13.2. Procedures that minimize the possibility of an unpermitted or uncontrolled
    detonation, release, discharge, or migration of AE out of any storage unit when such
        release, discharge, or migration may endanger human health or the environment.
    10.13.3. Provisions for prompt notification (to include withdrawal distances) to emergency
    response and environmental agencies and the potentially affected public for an actual or
    potential detonation or uncontrolled release, discharge, or migration of AE that may endanger
    human health or the environment.
    10.13.4. Provisions for complying with the Emergency Planning Community Right-To-
    Know Act (EPCRA) and Air Force implementing policies.
    10.13.5. Each unit and installation fire protection agency with AE storage and operations
    must develop pre-fire plans as prescribed by AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services
    Program. Include all AE locations and operations, to include licensed explosives storage
    locations.
    10.13.6. Each ECC will have an area map or computer-generated display showing all AE
    locations and operations and their firefighting symbols, to include licensed explosives storage
 188                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   locations. This map must also show adjacent facilities at risk from explosives. Whenever
   possible, ensure all sites have a CE real property identification number.
10.14. Fire Drills. Drills are conducted to train firefighting forces and unit personnel, and to
ensure all other personnel involved understand their duties. They are also conducted to evaluate
fire alarm systems, firefighting equipment, and evacuation procedures.
   10.14.1. Fire drills will be held within the explosives storage area at intervals not to exceed 6
   months.
   10.14.2. Coordinate fire drills with the Base Fire Chief if a Fire Department response is
   involved. This does not preclude unannounced drills of a Fire Department's response
   capabilities, provided coordination with the Base Fire Chief is accomplished at least 30
   minutes before starting the drill.
   10.14.3. Personnel responsible for conducting drills will ensure all involved are aware that
   the drill is an exercise, and not an actual fire.

Section 10E—Fire Prevention

10.15. Heat-Producing Devices. In any explosives area, use devices that produce temperatures
higher than 228o F (109o C) temporarily and only when essential. Develop written safety
procedures for these devices and include details on the location, purpose, and duration of use.
Coordinate the procedures through the installation safety office and the Fire Department for
approval. Properly installed, approved furnaces and electrical space heaters are exempt. Heat-
producing devices are not allowed where exposed explosives are present. Ensure personnel are
qualified on the equipment prior to use.
10.16. Vegetation Control. The primary purpose of vegetation control is to limit the
probability of combustible vegetation catching fire and to slow the spread of vegetation fires.
   10.16.1. Except for firebreaks, maintain grounds in or near explosives storage areas or
   operating locations according to AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources. Limit
   maintenance on these grounds to that which is necessary to prevent erosion or other waste of
   natural resources.
   10.16.2. Balance the level of vegetation control with operational factors, such as cost to
   control, security, erosion prevention, and passive defense (camouflage).
   10.16.3. Use varieties of vegetation that are resistant to burning where feasible.
   10.16.4. Do not use herbicides or soil sterilants if complete removal of vegetation will tend
   to cause soil erosion.
   10.16.5. Do not allow dead or cut vegetation to accumulate.
   10.16.6. When animals are used for vegetation control on barricade surfaces and igloo earth
   cover, avoid overgrazing to prevent erosion.
10.17. Firebreaks. Where environmental and security factors allow, maintain 50-foot
firebreaks around each PES except for ECMs. Maintain 5 feet around ECM ventilators.
10.18. Controlled Burning. The Base Fire Chief approves and provides oversight for
controlled burning of vegetation.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   189


   10.18.1. Do not conduct controlled burning within 200 feet of any explosives location.
   10.18.2. Close windows, doors and ventilators of facilities containing explosives within 600
   feet of burning operations.
   10.18.3. All controlled burns will be accomplished according to approved, site specific burn
   plans. See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management for additional
   information.
   10.18.4. The Base Fire Chief determines firefighting personnel and equipment to be present
   during burning operations.
10.19. Flammable Liquids for Cleaning. Do not use flammable liquids for cleaning purposes
within an explosives area or near explosives, except as authorized by T.O. Confine use to
specific designated work areas. In-use stocks may not exceed a one-day supply. Store in
approved safety containers or dispensers.
10.20. Paint and Other Flammable Materials. The following guidance applies when using
paint and other flammable materials in AE locations.
   10.20.1. Comply with AFOSH Standard 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational
   Safety Standard. Store flammable materials in approved flammable storage cabinets, as
   required.
   10.20.2. Small quantities of flammable materials, such as paints, lubricants and solvents,
   required to support explosives maintenance operations may be stored in explosives operating
   locations as required. This storage must not be the primary purpose of the area. Incidental
   storage of flammable materials not supporting explosives maintenance operations may be
   authorized within 50 feet of explosives operating locations. Fire department officials shall be
   consulted prior to establishing flammable storage areas in or near explosives operating
   locations.
   10.20.3. Do not store materials that add fuel sources (such as wood, paper, and rags) with
   flammable materials.
   10.20.4. Open containers of flammable materials only when in use.
   10.20.5. For outdoor storage, place flammable materials in weatherproof containers.
   10.20.6. Locate flammable storage locations at least 50 feet from explosives locations or
   isolate flammable storage by standard fire walls approved for the type and quantity of
   flammables being stored.
   10.20.7. Make available at least one fire extinguisher with a rating suitable for the type of
   material involved within the distance prescribed by AFOSH 91-501.
10.21. Operating Support Equipment. The following guidance applies when operating
support equipment (not including vehicles powered by internal combustion engines in AE
locations.)
   10.21.1. Separation Distances.

combustible material in AE locations.
   10.22.1. Stack containers, dunnage, lumber and so forth in an orderly manner.
   10.22.2. Keep stacks stable and separated as far as practical from operations.
   10.22.3. Limit stacks to 9,000 cubic feet.
   10.22.4. Do not place bulk stacks of combustible materials closer than 100 feet from AE
   locations.
   10.22.5. If necessary, stack working quantities in the vicinity of AE. Remove all of the
   material upon completion of the operation or at intervals that prevent hazardous
   accumulation.
   10.22.6. Provide suitable fire protection equipment.
   10.22.7. When needed to prepare for combat operations, temporarily stack in or near the AE
   storage site those empty containers, dunnage, and lumber that cannot be removed while the
   work is in progress.
10.23. Fire Extinguishers. Unless otherwise directed by the Base Fire Chief, provide a
minimum of two serviceable fire extinguishers, suitable for the hazards involved, for immediate
use at any location where AE is being handled, except as noted.
   10.23.1. See paragraph 11.7.8 for licensed explosives storage locations.
   10.23.2. Provide each explosives-laden vehicle used for transport with at least two portable
   2A:10BC rated extinguishers. One extinguisher will be mounted on the exterior driver’s side
   of the vehicle and one will be mounted inside the cab, readily accessible to the driver. If
   explosives-laden vehicles are parked at an explosives location, additional fire extinguishers
   beyond those required in paragraph 10.23 are not required. If the vehicle leaves the
   explosives location, additional extinguishers are required. Refer to AFJMAN 24-306,
   Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, and AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, for further
   guidance.
   10.23.3. Ensure at least one fire extinguisher is available for each item of powered materiel-
   handling equipment used to handle AE.
       10.23.3.1. Individual fire extinguishers are not required for each piece of handling
       equipment during explosive operations if the requirements of paragraph 10.23 are met.
  AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                                            191


           10.23.3.2. If handling equipment is used to transport AE to a location where a second
           fire extinguisher is not immediately available, two portable 2A:10BC rated extinguishers
           are required for the handling equipment.
       10.23.4. Provide flightline fire extinguishers for aircraft according to munitions loading
       manuals, AFOSH Standard 91-501, and T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and

                   LICENSED EXPLOSIVES STORAGE LOCATIONS

Section 11A—Purpose and Limitations for Licensed Explosives Storage Locations

11.1. Purpose of Licensed Explosives Storage Locations. Storage of small amounts of AE is
sometimes required in facilities or locations that are not explosives sited in accordance with
Chapter 14. Such storage may be permitted in a licensed explosives storage location in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter. Operations involving AE stored in explosives
licensed locations and storage of AE not requiring licensing or explosives siting are also covered
in this chapter.
   11.1.1. Licenses do not apply to explosives operations other than those listed in this chapter.
   11.1.2. Licenses are not to be used for convenience.
   11.1.3. Licenses are issued by the host weapons safety office.
   11.1.4. Except as specified in this chapter, QD requirements do not apply to licensed
   explosives storage locations.
   11.1.5. Local written instructions are required for each explosives license.
11.2. General Limitations on AE in Licensed Explosives Storage Locations.
   11.2.1. Quantities of AE must be limited to minimum quantities necessary to support
   specific, mission essential, and explosives operations or missions.
   11.2.2. CG A, K, and L will not be licensed.            Compatibility requirements specified
   elsewhere in this Manual do not apply.
   11.2.3. HD 1.2.1 and HD 1.2.3 will not be stored in a licensed explosives location, except as
   allowed per paragraph 11.15.
   11.2.4. HD 1.1 will not be stored in a licensed explosives location, except as allowed per
   paragraphs 11.15 and 11.23.
11.3. NEWQD Limitations on AE in Licensed Explosives Storage Locations. The following
quantities of AE, expressed as NEWQD, will not be exceeded on any one license.
   11.3.1. Mission essential quantities of HD 1.4.
   11.3.2. 100 lbs of HD 1.3.
   11.3.3. 100 lbs of HD 1.2.2.
   11.3.4. Deleted.
   11.3.5. Turn in unserviceable explosive components or items to the base munitions storage
   area as quickly as possible to preclude build-up of unserviceable NEWQD. Unserviceable
   NEWQD must be counted against the total NEWQD of the licensed facility.

11.4. General Requirements for Licensed Explosives Storage Locations.
   11.4.1. The structure or room used for storage must be capable of being locked to prevent
   pilferage and unauthorized handling. Contact Security Forces for resource protection
   requirements.
   11.4.2. Post firefighting symbols in accordance with paragraph 10.7.
       11.4.3. Provide dunnage for ventilation when required by civil engineering, logistics or
       bioenvironmental directives.
11.5. Separation Requirements for Licensed Explosives Storage Locations.
   11.5.1. No separation requirements apply to HD 1.4 AE stored in licensed explosives storage
   locations.
   11.5.2. A minimum separation of 25 ft is required from licensed explosives storage locations
   containing HD 1.3 AE to unrelated explosives operations, unrelated personnel, or other
   licensed explosives storage locations. Where 25 ft cannot be obtained, a 2-hour fire rated
   wall or 2-hour fire rated cabinet is required.
   11.5.3. A minimum separation of 100 ft is required from licensed explosives storage
   locations containing HD 1.2.2 AE to unrelated explosives operations, unrelated personnel, or
   other licensed explosives storage locations. Where 100 ft cannot be maintained, a fragment
   barrier that provides protection equal to ¼-inch mild steel plate or one layer of sand bags is
   required. A substantial dividing wall (SDW) (see paragraph 6.28) is an acceptable fragment
   barrier.
   11.5.4. A fragment barrier consisting of either a ¼-inch mild steel plate or one layer of sand
   bags is required when HD 1.2.2 is stored inside or IBD is not provided to other non-related
   facilities.
   11.5.5. In accordance with the general explosives safety requirement to separate explosives
   storage and operations, the maximum separation possible shall be provided between a
   licensed explosives storage location and the operation and personnel it supports. The
   requirements of paragraphs 11.5.2 and 11.5.3 shall be complied with to the maximum extent
   possible.
   11.5.6. Parking Areas.
       11.5.6.1. POV, GOV and AGE parking areas will be located a minimum of 100 ft from a
       licensed location. This minimum distance of 100 ft may be reduced to 50 ft if the PES is
       of non-combustible construction, a barrier sufficient to prevent the vehicle from rolling
       within 50 ft of the PES is located between the POV parking spaces and the PES.
       11.5.6.2. Temporary parking of GOVs or AGE, other than those being loaded or
       unloaded, will not be closer than 25 ft to any licensed location. Temporary means the
       length of time for which the presence of the vehicle is essential to completion of a single
       task (e.g., a single work order number).
       11.5.6.3. Local fire and safety officials may reduce these parking requirements for each
       licensed location.

Section 11E—Requirements for Specific Licensed Explosives Storage Locations

11.10. Mobility Storage. AE designated for mobility shall be stored within the base munitions
storage area until ready for shipment, unless the deploying unit has an extremely short timeline
requirement that makes it impossible to store within the MSA. License the storage of pre-
positioned mobility AE only if a properly sited area is not available. The license is valid only for
the duration of the mobility tasking. At host units without a designated munitions storage area,
explosive items designated for mobility may be stored in a consolidated licensed location
providing adherence to all Chapter 11 provisions.
11.11. Training and Exercises. Licensing AE locations used solely for exercises, such as the
ground burst simulators, smoke grenade storage, etc., is permitted. This license is valid only for
the duration of the exercise.
11.12. Control Tower. If required, license the storage of necessary quantities of HD 1.3
pyrotechnics needed to conduct emergency operations at fixed and mobile control towers. Do
not load pyrotechnic projectors and pistols unless the operational situation demands a state of
immediate readiness. The same safety and security requirements that apply to firearms apply to
projectors and pistols. Place in a proper rack, locker, box or compartment to prevent damage,
unauthorized handling, theft or accidental discharge.
11.13. Aircrew Flight Equipment.
   11.13.1. A license is not required for assembled parachutes, aircrew flight equipment kits,
   life rafts and life preservers containing authorized explosives when kept in personnel
   equipment rooms, life rafts, and aircrew flight equipment shops.
   11.13.2. A license is required for those areas in which aircrew flight equipment explosive
   components are stored.
   11.13.3. An operating instruction, approved by the commander (see Section 7B), is required
   for all aircrew flight equipment shop operations involving explosive components.
11.14. Riot Control Items. If required, store riot control and smoke grenades (except WP
grenades) with small arms ammunition in arms rooms and other such locations. However, if the
arms room is collocated with a facility where personnel are under physical restraint or
confinement, the National Fire Codes, Standard 101, Life Safety Code, applies. Don't store 40-
millimeter grenades, pyrotechnics, tear gas or chemical irritants in the room regardless of the QD
division or compatibility, unless the arms room has protective features which completely protect
detainees from the effects of accidental explosives activation. Protective features include

fragment barriers, blast doors, and exhaust fans. Qualified engineers must evaluate capabilities
of protective features. Limit the quantity to the smallest amount needed to support approved
contingency plans.
11.15. Egress Systems Maintenance Shops. When necessary, units may license a limited
quantity of in-use egress explosive components of any hazard division (including HD 1.1) in the
egress shop after removal from aircraft undergoing maintenance. Don't exceed the total number
of complete sets for the number of aircraft in maintenance. The following special provisions
apply:
   11.15.1. Ejection seats, canopies, and explosives components not undergoing actual
   maintenance, will be stored in a separate location outside the maintenance area. Ejection
   seats may only be stored in the maintenance area while maintenance is being conducted on
   other seats if all explosive components have been removed from the seats to be stored and
   placed in a separate storage location.
   11.15.2. Within the egress maintenance work area, the NEWQD limitations in paragraph
   11.3 apply to the number of seats and spare components undergoing maintenance at any one
   time.
11.16. Gun Systems and Maintenance Shops. When possible, remove ammunition from guns
and gun systems before they are brought into a weapons maintenance facility for repair. Gun
systems using drums don’t require removal of ammunition if the feed system is mechanically
safed to prevent ammunition from feeding into the gun. QD requirements do not apply to gun
system maintenance operations when explosives are limited to HD 1.4 and 100 pounds of HD
1.2.2 provided the using organizations ensure:
   11.16.1. MAJCOMs will establish procedures for clearing jammed guns. Consider both
   active and contingency bases.
   11.16.2. Guns or gun systems loaded with ammunition will not be brought into the
   maintenance facility until needed to meet the work schedule and are removed immediately
   after repair.
   11.16.3. Precautions are established to prevent inadvertent firing.
   11.16.4. Gun systems with live ammunition are grounded.
   11.16.5. Gun system is pointed in the least hazardous direction.
   11.16.6. Downloaded ammunition is removed from the building and returned to the base
   munitions storage area as soon as possible.
   11.16.7. Compliance with general explosives safety standards.
11.17. Incendiary Equipment and Document Destroyers. If necessary, store these items near
the planned point of use to comply with emergency destruction plans. Establish quantities for
each location by coordinating with base explosives safety representatives and your security
representatives. The 100-pound HD 1.3 limit does not apply in this case. Limit quantity to the
amount needed for emergency destruction plans. Training quantities are not authorized.
Construct or protect storage rooms with noncombustible or fire-resistive material. If possible
store in nearby small low-cost structures (sheds, conex, etc.). Ensure adequate ventilation is
provided. Maintain 50-foot firebreaks or vegetation control zones and locate at least 75 feet
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 203


from any other building. Store replacement stocks in the base explosives storage area. Only
trained personnel are allowed to prepare and activate these devices.
11.18. Rod and Gun Clubs. License the explosives storage locations for clubs that hand-load
ammunition on Air Force property. For skeet and trap ranges adhere to criteria established by
the National Skeet Shooting Association. See also paragraphs 11.19 and 11.20. Designate a
qualified member to identify and enforce criteria.
11.19. Retail Stores. Where only retail sales are made, paragraph 11.25 applies. Don't
complete a license unless the store sells primers and smokeless powder. More than 100 lbs of
propellant and 25,000 primers, packed in their shipping containers, may be licensed if they are
segregated in such a way that the MCE does not exceed 100 lbs of propellant and 25,000
primers, i.e., if IM separation is met. Don't place HD 1.3 propellant in other containers if it
would result in extreme confinement in the event of ignition. Use fire symbol 3 to designate the
presence of both the propellant and primers. Keep the symbol posted during temporary periods
when the propellant has been sold out, but primers are still in stock.
11.20. Hand Loading. Conduct hand-loading operations in a room or building used solely for
this purpose. Don't store or reload ammunition in dormitories or bachelor officer quarters. Use
retail store safety requirements as well as the following:
   11.20.1. Develop and post an approved, locally-written procedure. Refer to AFI 31-101,
   Integrated Defense, for security.
   11.20.2. Grant loading privileges to only authorized personnel trained in the use of hand-
   loading equipment, safety provisions, and hazards involved. Wear safety goggles or face
   shields during all loading operations.
   11.20.3. Strictly supervise members in training. Keep a log showing names of certifying
   instructors and each person who has satisfactorily completed the training.
   11.20.4. Do not permit smoking, matches or flame-producing devices in any loading or
   storage location.
   11.20.5. Place a ground bar with a resistance of 25 Ohms or less at each entrance to the
   hand-loading room.
   11.20.6. Post a sign requiring each person to touch the ground bar before entering the room.
   11.20.7. Maintain and inspect the ground bar as outlined in Chapter 5.
   11.20.8. Post explosives and personnel limits. Allow no more than 10 lbs of propellants,
   10,000 primers, and 5,000 assembled rounds in the hand loading room at one time. These
   quantities are considered as part of the overall limits for the building.
   11.20.9. Provide storage lockers for propellant and transfer to the loading point only
   quantities required to sustain a continuous operation.
   11.20.10. Remove only one packing tray at a time from primer storage.
   11.20.11. Repack unused components in their original containers and return them to the
   storage locker at the end of each loading operation.
   11.20.12. Lock unused lockers.

   11.20.13. Cover tables used for hand loading with a seamless, nonporous, non-sparking
   conductive material.
   11.20.14. Permanently attach and bond hand-loading equipment to a 25 Ohm or less
   grounded tabletop.
   11.20.15. Test the grounding system twice a year and when broken connectors are repaired.
   11.20.16. Document grounding system test results.
   11.20.17. Visually inspect ground conductors before each day's operation.
   11.20.18. Keep floors and walls free of cracks that could accumulate explosive dust and
   foreign materials. Observe good housekeeping practices at all times.
   11.20.19. In case of a spill, stop all operations until the propellant is cleaned up.
   11.20.20. Put all salvaged propellant in a metal container that contains water and is marked
   "Scrap Explosives."
   11.20.21. Put all damaged components or complete rounds in separate, properly-marked
   containers.
   11.20.22. Separate unserviceable items from serviceable stocks.
   11.20.23. Qualified personnel must dispose of unserviceable propellants, damaged rounds or
   components, and empty explosives containers as directed in T.O. 11A-1-42, General
   Instructions for Disposal of Conventional Munitions, and T.O. 11A-1-60, Inspection of
   Reusable Munitions Containers and Scrap Material.
   11.20.24. Use only commercial-type loading tools, dies, scales, powder measures, and so
   forth for hand-loading operations.
   11.20.25. Place personnel protection shields between each piece of permanently-attached
   hand-loading equipment. Shields must be large enough to protect adjacent personnel.
   Shields can be made of plywood, Plexiglas or similar materials.
   11.20.26. Do bullet molding outside the hand-loading room.
11.21. Force Support Squadron Activities (formerly MWR Activities). Force Support
Squadron activities such as aero clubs and boating activities are sometimes required to maintain
and store commercial pyrotechnic signals. Control and store these items using the same criteria
as the military item which they resemble. Ensure personnel are properly trained. License the
storage locations. Technical data or manufacturer's data are sources for locally-written
procedures.
11.22. Minuteman Handling Team Facility. The transporter erector (TE) tractor or autocar
with missile in tow may require temporary storage in the Minuteman Handling Team (MHT)
facility. When using this procedure, comply with the following conditions:
   11.22.1. Storage is essential to meet operating requirements.
   11.22.2. Vehicle is chocked and grounded.
   11.22.3. Vehicle safety inspection is performed and no safety deficiencies exist.

      11.23. Research and Development Laboratories for Specific Experiments. When necessary,
      units may license a limited quantity, not to exceed 200 grams in each licensed location, of HD
      1.1 material for research use in laboratories. Licensing explosives used solely for a research
      project is allowed only for the length of the project. Commander-approved, locally-written
      procedures are required for the explosives operation.
      11.24. Base Defense Support Munitions for Dispersed Locations. When required for defense
      against hostile forces, pre-position base defense explosives stocks in licensed temporary
      magazines. Store and protect licensed facilities and stocks as stated below:
           11.24.1. If necessary, omit fire and hazard symbols to avoid attention of hostile forces. Post
           "No Smoking" signs and keep the fire department informed of each facility's location and
           type of explosives.
           11.24.2. Follow the instructions in paragraphs 11.4 and 11.5 if the facility is stocked with
           HD 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and riot control items.
           11.24.3. Explosives site plans must be submitted for HD 1.1 items.

      Section 11F—Items or Situations not Requiring a License

      11.25. Items or Situations not Requiring a License. Licenses are not required for the storage
      of small arms ammunition (.50 caliber or less), commercial maritime distress signals and like
      items held by base exchanges and individuals in family housing. However, if the Base Exchange
      stores primers and smokeless powder, complete a license and apply the limitations of paragraph
      11.19. This exception also applies to locations storing less than 1,000 rounds of HD 1.4 small
      arms ammunition or cartridges for cartridge-actuated tools (up to 5,000 feet of shock tube) and to
      locations storing thermal batteries. However, this exception for quantities less than 1,000 rounds
      of HD 1.4 does not apply to the on-base storage of bird scare ammunition, privately-owned
      ammunition belonging to dormitory and billeting residents, or approved commercial off-the-shelf
      explosives, except as noted in this Manual. This ammunition will always be stored in approved,
      licensed explosives storage locations, regardless of quantity. Additionally, F/A-22 assembled
      pylons in storage do not require a license. See also paragraph 11.13.

                                          Chapter 12

                            QUANTITY-DISTANCE CRITERIA

Section 12A—Introduction

12.1. Introduction. The term ―Quantity-Distance‖ (QD) refers to protection requirements from
potential explosion sites (PES) to different kinds of exposed sites (ES). The QD standards were
developed over many years and are based on explosives mishaps, tests and analyses. QD
separations are based on an acceptable level of damage between a PES and an ES.
   12.1.1. The damage or injury potential of explosions is normally determined by the
   separation distance between the PES and ES; the ability of the PES to suppress blast
   overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion
   effects. This chapter:
       12.1.1.1. Defines permissible exposures for both accidental and intentional detonations.
       12.1.1.2. Sets minimum standards for separation distances between PES and ES by
       taking into account anticipated explosion effects, suppression, and resistance.
       12.1.1.3. Establishes explosives safety siting criteria (QD relationships) for PES and ES,
       based on blast, fragment, firebrand, thermal, and groundshock effects. QD is determined
       by the effect requiring the greatest distance.
   12.1.2. When an appropriate degree of protection can be provided either by hardening an ES
   or construction of a PES to suppress explosion effects, these factors may be taken into
   account and the distance required by the standard QD tables may be reduced. Submit
   construction designs with rationale or test results with the explosives site plan (ESP). See
   Chapter 6.
   12.1.3. QD separation does not apply to AE in the transportation mode (reference Chapter
   8).

Section 12B—Quantity-Distance Principles

12.2. General. The bases for determining required separation distances (QD) are:
   12.2.1. The construction and type of PES.
   12.2.2. The HD types and NEWQD of AE present in the PES.
   12.2.3. The construction and type of ES.
   12.2.4. The distance separating the PES from the ES.
   12.2.5. In some instances, the orientation of the PES and the ES.
12.3. Types of Separations.
   12.3.1. Inhabited Building Distance (IBD). This is the minimum distance required to
   protect facilities and personnel not directly related to explosives storage and operations. At
208                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


  this distance, some damage and personnel injury may still be expected (see Chapter 2 for
  reaction effects).
  12.3.2. Public Traffic Route Distance (PTRD). This is the minimum distance required to
  protect public traffic routes (see paragraph 12.16.3 for on-base roads) and other designated
  exposures. At this distance, damage and personnel injury is expected (see Chapter 2 for
  reaction effects). For HD 1.1 and 1.2, PTRD is normally 60% of IBD. For HD 1.3 and 1.4,
  PTRD is the same as IBD. Public traffic routes are classified as high, medium, and low
  traffic density. The traffic density will be averaged over a normal (non-holiday) week in
  terms of number of passengers during a 24-hour period. (Note: In applying criteria other
  than the default values given below (which are based on car (and rail) speed of 50 mph, and a
  ship speed of 10 mph), considerations such as the following will be taken into account to
  establish exposure levels: speed of vehicles, number of passengers per vehicle, protection
  afforded by the vehicle, variation in daily traffic levels in relation to AE activities, and
  seasonal traffic trends. The default value of two passengers per car may be used to estimate
  traffic density.)
      12.3.2.1. High Traffic Density. Routes which have 10,000 or more car or rail
      passengers per day, or 2,000 or more ship passengers per day. IBD separation is required
      for high traffic density routes per paragraph 12.15.1.19.
      12.3.2.2. Medium Traffic Density. Routes which have at least 400 but less than 10,000
      car or rail passengers per day, or at least 80 but less than 2,000 ship passengers per day.
      As a minimum, medium traffic density route criteria apply to any recreational activity
      that is extensive and occurs on a regular basis. PTRD separation is required for medium
      traffic density routes per paragraph 12.16.1.
      12.3.2.3. Low Traffic Density. Routes which have fewer than 400 car or rail passengers
      per day, or fewer than 80 ship passengers per day. PTRD separation (based on blast
      criteria only) is required for low traffic density routes per paragraph 12.16.2.
  12.3.3. Intraline Distance (ILD). This is the minimum distance required to protect
  activities associated with explosives storage and operations. Applying ILD recognizes the
  operational need for some people to be in the proximity of explosives while at the same time
  preserving some mission capability in the event of an explosives accident. Unhardened
  facilities at this distance will be extensively damaged and occupants may be severely injured
  (see Chapter 2 for reaction effects). In addition to the minimal protection to related
  activities, ILD should prevent propagation between two explosives locations. At ILD, no
  propagation from the blast overpressure is expected, and the probability of propagation from
  low angle, high velocity fragments is significantly reduced. For HD 1.1 and 1.2, ILD is
  normally 36% of IBD.
  12.3.4. Intermagazine Distance (IMD). This is the minimum distance between PESs to
  prevent one PES from simultaneously detonating an adjacent PES. Maintaining IMD is no
  guarantee that propagation from one PES to another will not occur, only that they will not
  simultaneously detonate. At this distance, severe structural damage approaching total
  destruction is expected for conventional structures, and severe personnel injury or death is
  expected (see Chapter 2 for reaction effects). Earth Covered Magazines (ECM) provide
  significant protection at IMD; maintaining IMD between ECMs will provide virtually
  complete protection of AE against the propagation effects of an explosion. However, AE in
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 209


   adjacent ECMs may be damaged (see paragraph 2.1.5.3). When less than required IMD
   exists between any two or more PESs, the quantities of explosives in these locations must be
   added to form a single PES encompassing the area and NEWQDs of the PESs which do not
   meet IMD. For this reason, any separation between explosives locations less than IMD may
   not be waived.

Section 12C—Determining Net Explosive Weight for Quantity-Distance

12.4. Determining NEWQD of AE Items. See paragraph 3.6 for guidance on determining the
NEWQD of AE items. The explosive weight of Not-Regulated AE and AE assigned to Classes 2
through 9 is not considered for QD purposes (see paragraph 3.5).
12.5. Determining NEWQD of a PES. Generally, the combined NEWQD of all AE in a PES
is used as the NEWQD of the PES for explosives siting. Determine NEWQD of a PES as
follows:
   12.5.1. If only one HD is present, combine the NEWQD of each AE item involved.
   12.5.2. If multiple HDs are authorized, but only one HD is present at a time, determine the
   NEWQD separately for each HD (as described in paragraph 12.5.1).
   12.5.3. If more than one HD is present at the same time, determine the NEWQD per
   paragraph 12.7.
   12.5.4. See Section 12N for determining NEWQD for energetic liquids.
   12.5.5. Where explosives are located in a common facility or location and are further
   subdivided into cells or stacks by IMD or equivalent protection (such as for buffered storage
   or multicubicals), the cell or stack with the greatest NEWQD may be used for explosives
   siting if specifically allowed by this Manual or approved by AFSC/SEW. Where IMD or
   equivalent protection is not provided, use the total NEWQD of all explosives.
   12.5.6. For HD 1.2.1, the MCE as outlined in paragraph 3.16.4. will also be used as the basis
   for determining applicable QD.
   12.5.7. For HD 1.2.3, the LSRN as outlined in paragraph 14.23.6. will also be used as the
   basis for determining applicable QD.
   12.5.8. The NEWQD of a host nation PES that may be hazarding Air Force facilities and
   personnel will be based on the maximum NEWQD the host nation indicates will ever be
   present at that PES location. If the NEWQD cannot be obtained from the host nation, the
   responsible safety staff must estimate the type and quantity of explosives. Base estimates on
   knowledge of the host nation's military mission and type of facility involved (such as ECM,
   aircraft shelter, or maintenance facility). As a general rule, use the maximum NEWQD that
   would be allowed in a similar Air Force facility per paragraph 12.6.
   12.5.9. When an AE conveyance (e.g., railroad car or motor vehicle), containing AE is not
   separated from a PES in such a manner as to prevent mass detonation, then the conveyance
   and PES will be considered as a unit and their NEWQD will be summed. This does not
   apply to temporary staging for the purpose of loading/unloading.
   12.5.10. The NEWQD of the HD requiring the greatest separation establishes the QD for the
   facility when it is used for multiple operations.
 210                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


12.6. Maximum NEWQD. Regardless of actual separations, maximum NEWQD limitations
for HD 1.1 and 1.2 are as follows:
   12.6.1. ECMs (except as noted in paragraph 12.6.2) and AGMs: 500,000 lbs.
   12.6.2. 7-Bar Navy Box Type: 500,000 lbs except as noted in DDESB TP 15.
   12.6.3. Non-standard ECMs: 250,000 lbs. Note: Sitings of non-standard ECMs sited prior
   to February 1999 for explosives weights not exceeding 250,000 lbs remain valid. Future
   sitings, including those where these ECMs are exposed sites, must comply with this Manual.
   12.6.4. Barricaded modules at K1.1: 250,000 lbs.
   12.6.5. Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HASs): See para 12.51.5.
   12.6.6. Some facilities may have additional limits in order to use reduced QD criteria.
12.7. Determining NEWQD for Mixed HD.
   12.7.1. General.
       12.7.1.1. The presence of HD 1.4 does not affect the NEWQD of mixed HD. However,
       for QD determinations, HD 1.4 criteria will be considered.
       12.7.1.2. When HD 1.1 is mixed with any other HD, treat the mixture as HD 1.1 except
       as noted in paragraph 12.7.2.
       12.7.1.3. HD 1.5 is always treated as HD 1.1.
       12.7.1.4. When dissimilar HD 1.6 are mixed and have not been tested to ensure non-
       propagation, the mixed HD 1.6 AE will be individually considered to be HD 1.2.1 or HD
       1.2.2, based on their individual NEWQD or over-riding fragmentation characteristics.
   12.7.2. HD 1.1 with HD 1.2. Use whichever of the following generates the largest QD:
       12.7.2.1. Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and NEWQD for HD 1.2 and treat the mixture as
       HD 1.1.
       12.7.2.2. The NEWQD of the mixture is the NEWQD of the HD 1.2 sub-division
       requiring the largest QD.
   12.7.3. HD 1.1 with HD 1.3. Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and the NEWQD for HD 1.3 and
   treat the mixture as HD 1.1. AFSC/SEW may grant exceptions to this guidance when
   analyses or test results demonstrate that the HD 1.1 (for liquid propellants) will not cause
   detonation of the HD 1.3.
   12.7.4. HD 1.1 with HD 1.6. Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and the NEWQD for HD 1.6 and
   treat the mixture as HD 1.1.
   12.7.5. HD 1.2.1 with HD 1.2.2. The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-
   division requiring the largest QD.
   12.7.6. HD 1.2.1 with HD 1.2.3. The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-
   division requiring the largest QD.
   12.7.7. HD 1.2.2 with HD 1.2.3. The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-
   division requiring the largest QD.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    211


   12.7.8. HD 1.2.1 with HD 1.2.2 with HD 1.2.3. The NEWQD for the mixture is the
   NEWQD of the sub-division requiring the largest QD.
   12.7.9. HD 1.2 with HD 1.3. The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the HD
   requiring the largest QD.
   12.7.10. HD 1.2 with HD 1.6. Treat the HD 1.6 as HD 1.2.3 and determine NEWQD in
   accordance with paragraphs 12.7.6 to 12.7.8, mixing rules for 1.2.3, as applicable.
   12.7.11. HD 1.3 with HD 1.6. Sum the NEWQD for the HD 1.6 and the NEWQD for the
   HD 1.3 and treat the mixture as HD 1.3.

Section 12D—Determining Distances Between PESs and ESs

12.8. General. Separation distances are measured along straight lines. For large intervening
topographical features such as hills, measure over or around the feature, whichever is the shorter.
12.9. Measuring from a PES. Measure from a PES, to an ES, as follows:
   12.9.1. The outside of the nearest exterior wall of the PES.
   12.9.2. The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room, within the PES, containing
   explosives.
   12.9.3. The outside of the nearest wall of the compartment containing the greatest quantity
   distance hazard, when the PES is subdivided so that mass detonation between compartments
   will not occur.
   12.9.4. The stack face of an open storage PES, such as modules and revetments.
   12.9.5. The explosives carried externally on an aircraft which is parked either in the open or
   inside an approved lightweight shelter.
   12.9.6. The explosives on an AE conveyance (e.g. railroad car or motor vehicle) located in
   the open, and separated from other PESs in such a manner as to prevent mass detonation.
   12.9.7. The nearest edge of an AE conveyance (e.g. railroad car or motor vehicle) located in
   the open, and not separated from other PESs in such a manner as to prevent mass detonation.
   12.9.8. The nearest external wall of the shelter or stall containing explosives or explosives-
   loaded aircraft, in a hardened aircraft shelters (HAS).
   12.9.9. The center of large missile silos, launchers or launch pads.
   12.9.10. The edge of a facility pad if it will be used to hold munitions.
   12.9.11. The nearest edge of the aircraft cargo hold for internally-loaded explosives.
12.10. Measuring to an ES. Measure to an ES, from a PES, as follows:
   12.10.1. The nearest edge of a non-explosives location, building, or taxiway.
   12.10.2. The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room containing people, for an
   occupied ES.
   12.10.3. The stack face of an open storage PES, acting as an ES.
 212                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.10.4. The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room containing explosives, for
   an ES requiring IMD.
   12.10.5. The nearest edge of the tee or green or the centerline of the fairway, for a golf
   course.
   12.10.6. The centerline of a runway.
   12.10.7. The nearest edge of an open recreational area.
   12.10.8. The nearest edge of the aircraft cargo hold for internally-loaded explosives.
   12.10.9. The edge of the roadway or pavement, for an ES requiring PTRD.
   12.10.10. The nearest point of an aircraft, if aircraft survivability is required.
   12.10.11. The nearest AE (internal or external) on an aircraft, if only IMD or ILD protection
   is required.

Section 12E—Quantity-Distance Application

12.11. Quantity-Distance K-Factors. NEWQD is used to calculate QD separations for blast
protection by means of the formula:
              D = K x NEWQD1/3

              Where: D = required distance (in feet)
              K = protection factor depending on the degree of risk assumed or permitted
              NEWQD1/3 = cube root of the NEWQD (in pounds)

Distance requirements are sometimes expressed by the value of K, using the terminology K9,
K11, K18, to mean K equals 9, K equals 11, K equals 18, etc. Tables 12.30 and 12.31 provide a
listing of distances for various K-factors at various NEWQDs.
   12.11.1. When performing QD calculations using formulae, resulting answers with a decimal
   value of 0.5 or more may be rounded up to the nearest whole number, and resulting answers
   with a decimal value of less than 0.5 may be rounded down to the nearest whole number. For
   example, if calculating the required distance:
              D = K(NEWQD)1/3 = 40(1500 lbs)1/3 = 457.89 ft = 458 ft
              D = K(NEWQD)1/3 = 18(200 lbs)1/3 = 105.26 ft = 105 ft

              Or, if calculating the allowable NEWQD:
              NEWQD = (D/K)3 = (1150 ft/40)3 = 23,763.67 lbs = 23,764 lbs
              NEWQD = (D/K)3 = (700 ft/18)3 = 58,813.44 lbs = 58,813 lbs
12.12. Paired Relationships.
   12.12.1. The quantity of explosives allowed in a PES is the most restrictive amount based on
   analyzing the nearest IM, IL, PTR, IB or other exposed site, subject to the NEWQD
   limitations in paragraph 12.6. Where there are two or more adjacent ESs, the quantity
   allowed at the PES is the smallest of the amounts permitted by considering each ES in turn.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  213


   12.12.2. The QD criteria for a PES-ES pair when both contain AE, are determined by
   considering each location, in turn, as a PES and an ES. The separation distance required for
   the pair is the greater of the two separation distances. An exception is permitted for service
   magazines supporting an AE operation; barricaded or unbarricaded (as appropriate) service
   magazine separation distances will be based on the NEWQD and the HD of the AE in the
   magazine and not that in the explosives operating location it supports.
12.13. QD Determination.
   12.13.1. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.1, determine the QD using Table 12.1 and Section
   12H.
   12.13.2. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.2, determine the QD using Table 12.2 and Section
   12I.
   12.13.3. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.3, determine the QD using Table 12.3 and Section
   12J.
   12.13.4. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.4, determine the QD using Table 12.3 and Section
   12K.
   12.13.5. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.5, treat as HD 1.1 for siting purposes and comply
   with paragraph 12.13.1.
   12.13.6. When all AE in the PES is HD 1.6, determine the QD using Table 12.3 and Section
   12L.
   12.13.7. When all AE in the PES is HD 6.1, determine the QD using Section 12M.
   12.13.8. When all AE in the PES are energetic liquids, determine the QD using Section 12N.
   12.13.9. When siting more than one type of AE, determine separately the QD criteria as
   required for each type of AE per paragraphs 12.13.1 through 12.13.9. Required QD
   separations will be based on the most restrictive QD determined.
   12.13.10. TO 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety Criteria, provides active materials storage standards
   for nuclear weapons and when more restrictive, those requirements override QD criteria in
   this Manual. Upon receipt of a Joint Test Assembly, organizations will use parent War
   Reserve weapon explosives criteria for storage and transportation while the assembly
   remains in Air Force custody.
   12.13.11. If unable to verify QD criteria for a specific weapon system or a given situation,
   contact the appropriate MAJCOM for instructions. Such cases may include unusual
   circumstances, configurations, protection or hazards. Storage and handling of some
   ammunition items are MAJCOM unique and do not fit into any criteria contained in this
   Manual. In such cases, request guidance in writing through command channels to
   AFSC/SEW, describing the specific situation, explaining the ammunition item and how it
   will be stored and handled. The AFSC/SEW letter of approval may be incorporated into the
   MAJCOM supplement to this Manual.

Section 12F—Allowable Exposures
 214                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


12.14. General. This section identifies allowable exposures to explosives. Further specific
guidance may be found in the appropriate sections of this Manual.            Contact your
MAJCOM/SEW for assistance in determining required separation if guidance is not provided in
this Manual.
12.15. Allowable IBD Exposures.

       12.15.1.13. Hydrazine servicing facilities which support multiple bases.
       12.15.1.14. Recreation facilities (e.g., ball diamonds, golf courses and volleyball courts)
       that contain structures, such as concession stands or bleachers. Note: PTR may be
       applied to the field, course or court but IBD is required to the subject structures.
       12.15.1.15. Flightline passenger service functions (e.g., terminal buildings).
       12.15.1.16. Main powerhouses that provide vital utilities to a major portion of an
       installation.
       12.15.1.17. Essential warehouses, shops and other facilities that by reason of their vital
       strategic nature, or high intrinsic value of their contents, should not be placed at risk.
       12.15.1.18. Functions that, if momentarily put out of action, would cause an immediate
       secondary hazard by reason of their failure to function.
       12.15.1.19. Public traffic routes with high traffic density as described in paragraph
       12.3.2.1.
       12.15.1.20. Auxiliary building when not directly related to the explosives mission and

       paragraph 12.16.9 if no structure is involved.) See paragraph 12.68.3.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                215


     12.15.1.21. Joint DoD or non-DoD use runway.

     12.15.1.24. Ground control approach (GCA), radar approach control (RAPCON), and air
     traffic control towers that support a joint use airfield, from all PESs.
     12.15.1.25. GCA, RAPCON, and air traffic control towers that support a military use
     only airfield, from non-flight line PESs. The IBD will be based on blast overpressure
     only; fragment distances will not be used.
     12.15.1.26. Hazardous waste collection points which do not exclusively support an
     explosives area.
     12.15.1.27. Unoccupied structures housing weather equipment        not exclusively
     supporting an explosives area. The IBD will be based on overpressure only; fragment
     distances will not be used.
     12.15.1.28. Activities such as concerts, bazaars, and ceremonies (e.g. change of
     command, etc.) attended by people not related to munitions or explosives work.
  12.15.2. Installation boundary. If a proposed PES would create an IBD clear zone extending
  beyond the base boundary, the hazard becomes a legal issue and MAJCOM/JA coordination
  will be required prior to establishing or constructing the PES. Note: Restrictive easements,
  Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), and Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) do not
  address existing exposures encumbered by the explosives clear zone of the PES. Existing
  exposures must be identified in the site plan request package and approved by the DDESB or
  AFSC for the QD exception. An IBD arc may fall outside of the installation boundary,
  without causing an exception to QD requirements, provided one of the following methods of
  protecting the public and public property is complied with:
     12.15.2.1. Off-base land owned by a Federal, State, or Municipal agency in the
     continental United States or its possessions or territories.
         12.15.2.1.1. An existing restrictive easement, MOA, or MOU encompasses the off-
         base land encumbered by the explosives clear zone of the PES. Prior to establishing
         the PES, SE, CE, and JA representatives must review and ensure compliance with
         applicable in-place restrictive easement, MOA, or MOU rights. The commander will
         designate personnel to perform a quarterly review of the area to ensure compliance
         with the restrictive easement, MOA, or MOU.
         12.15.2.1.2. A new restrictive easement, MOA, or MOU is obtained from the land
         owner for the off-base land encumbered by the explosives clear zone prior to
         establishing or constructing the PES. Before funding construction, the installation
         commander, Facility Board, and facility user must be briefed and accept the need to
         reduce or eliminate NEWQD in the user's facility to prevent an exception should the
         desired restrictive easement not be obtained. Request for preliminary explosives site
         plan approval may be sought prior to obtaining the restrictive easement.
         Documentation substantiating that the restrictive easement has been coordinated with
         the Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) and recorded with the USACE will be
216                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


         submitted with the request for final explosives site plan approval. The commander
         will designate personnel to perform a quarterly review of the area to ensure
         compliance with the restrictive easement.
         12.15.2.1.3. Off-base land owned by another DoD agency. In cases where an Air
         Force PES generates an explosives IBD clear zone encroaching onto property owned
         by another DoD service, the local Air Force organization responsible for submitting
         the site plan will obtain written acknowledgement from the exposed service
         component SE and CE equivalent offices for inclusion with the site plan submission
         package. It will be up to the acknowledging agency to update their maps to reflect the
         Air Force explosives clear zone for their future planning purposes and to notify the
         Air Force unit of any planned exposures. The MAJCOM and AFSC will coordinate
         with the applicable service component equivalent prior to requesting DDESB site
         plan approval. Recommend establishing a Memorandum of Understanding or
         Agreement with the other DoD agency.
         12.15.2.1.4. Off-base land owned by other Federal Agencies. In cases where an Air
         Force PES generates an explosives IBD clear zone encroaching onto property owned
         by another federal agency, the local Air Force organization responsible for submitting
         the site plan will obtain written acknowledgement from the exposed agency SE and
         CE equivalent offices for inclusion with the site plan submission package. It will be
         up to the acknowledging agency to update their maps to reflect the Air Force
         explosives clear zone for their future planning purposes and to notify the Air Force
         unit of any planned exposures. AFSC will coordinate with the applicable agency
         equivalent prior to requesting DDESB site plan approval. Recommend establishing a
         Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement with the other Federal agency.
      12.15.2.2. Off-base land owned by a private land owner requires a restrictive easement.
      All other requirements stated above in paragraphs 12.15.2.1.1 and 12.15.2.1.2 apply.
      12.15.2.3. The off-base land encumbered by the explosives clear zone is open and
      manifestly unsuitable for habitation or public gatherings, is government land that is not
      open to the public, or access is restricted and controlled by other means. Only
      appropriate local government agencies for public safety, environment and health can
      declare land outside the base boundary unsuitable for habitation or public gatherings.
      Documentation determining this land unsuitable for habitation or public gatherings must
      be maintained with real property records. The commander, Facility Board, and facility
      user must be briefed and accept the need to reduce or eliminate NEWQD in the PES
      creating the clear zone to prevent an exception should a new encumbrance occur. The
      commander will designate personnel to perform a quarterly review of the area to ensure it
      remains open, uninhabited and unused and he or she should periodically reconsider
      obtaining a restrictive easement, MOA, MOU or purchasing the land.
      12.15.2.4. Establishing a clear zone beyond the installation boundary that does not
      involve a private land owner and where no new construction is involved: If the IBD clear
      zone extends past the installation boundary, an exception must accompany the explosive
      site plan unless the following compensatory measures can be accomplished:
         12.15.2.4.1. A signed letter of agreement between the installation commander and
         airport manager stating that non-related personnel and activities will not be exposed
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    217


          when the mission generating the clear zone is implemented. Letters of Agreement are
          not intended to insinuate the land owner accepts the risk, but rather to confirm
          exposures will be eliminated when mission accomplishment dictates need.
          12.15.2.4.2. Letter of Agreement must address termination terms of the LOA in
          writing with the appropriate parties. The LOA must be coordinated with CE and JA
          to validate all the terms of the agreement.
12.16. Allowable PTRD Exposures.
   12.16.1. Public traffic routes with medium traffic density as described in paragraph 12.3.2.
   Medium traffic density criteria apply, as a minimum, to recreational activity that is extensive
   and occurs on a regular basis.
   12.16.2. Public traffic routes with low traffic density as described in paragraph 12.3.2. The
   PTRD will be based on blast overpressure only; fragment distances will not be used. Normal
   PTRD required for HD 1.2.X.
   12.16.3. On-Base Roads. On-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions-
   related operations are now considered public traffic routes. QD criteria is based on the traffic
   density (see paragraphs 12.3.2., 12.16.1 and 12.16.2.). In order to prevent the generation of a
   significant number of QD exemptions for existing roads, the procedures below have been
   established for assessing, documenting, and accepting the risks associated with application of
   QD criteria to on-base roads for PES/on-base road relationships which existed prior to 1 Oct
   00. After 1 Oct 00, any changes to a PES which increase its QD arc, construction of a new
   PES, construction of a new on-base road, or change in traffic density, will require application
   of QD criteria to on-base roads which are traveled by personnel not involved in PES-related
   operations (see also A5.3.) If QD criteria cannot be met, obtain an exemption per Section
   1B.
      12.16.3.1. For those sited (DDESB- or AFSC-approved or MAJCOM baseline-approved)
      PES/on-base road relationships which existed prior to 1 Oct 00, the following risk
      assessment and documentation must be accomplished:
          12.16.3.1.1. On a copy of the installation map, identify the following:
              12.16.3.1.1.1. All PESs having QD arcs (PTRD or IBD based on traffic density)
              encompassing on-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions-
              related operations.
              12.16.3.1.1.2. The NEWQD of the above PESs.
              12.16.3.1.1.3. The applicable QD arcs (PTR or IBD) of the above PESs based on
              the traffic density.
              12.16.3.1.1.4. The segments of the applicable on-base roads which pass through
              the above arcs.
          12.16.3.1.2. Perform a risk assessment of the relationships shown above in
          accordance with Chapter 4. Some factors that might be considered include:
              12.16.3.1.2.1. Operational necessity.
              12.16.3.1.2.2. The operation being performed (e.g., static storage, maintenance,
218                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


             and production).
             12.16.3.1.2.3. Operational activity cycles.
             12.16.3.1.2.4. Alternate routes.
             12.16.3.1.2.5. Traffic density.
             12.16.3.1.2.6. Accident records.
             12.16.3.1.2.7. Time interval of exposure.
             12.16.3.1.2.8. Type and quantity of munitions in proximity to the area transited.
             12.16.3.1.2.9. The closest distance from the area transited to the PES.
             12.16.3.1.2.10. The need for installation-related personnel to transit the QD arc.
             12.16.3.1.2.11. Consideration of methods to inform transients of potential risks
             (e.g., written acknowledgement of the risk by vendors or others with a recurring
             need to transit the QD arc, warning signs, flashing lights, physical barriers, etc.).
         12.16.3.1.3. Document the commander’s risk acceptance through a formal
         memorandum. This memorandum must include the map showing the relationships
         for which he or she is accepting risk, a summary of the risk assessment, and a
         statement that the subject relationships existed as of 1 Oct 00. Upon change of
         approving authority, ensure the new commander is informed of the previous risk
         acceptance.
      12.16.3.2. The commander’s risk acceptance and attached map must be included in
      amendments to site plans (for PESs which existed prior to 1 Oct 00) or referenced if
      previously submitted with another site plan amendment.
  12.16.4. Open-air recreation facilities (e.g., ball diamonds, golf courses and volleyball
  courts), which do not contain structures, used for Force Support Squadron (formally MWR)
  and community relations' purposes at military installations and activities. As an exception,
  neither blast nor fragment criteria apply, when such facilities are located near AE support
  operations and are used only by off-duty military or on-duty military or DoD civilians or
  contractors (e.g., munitions workers, security guards, firefighters) who directly support these
  AE operations. This total relaxation of QD requirements applies only when the PES and the
  ES are related closely as with a security alert force and explosives facilities for which they
  are responsible; it does not authorize the building of elaborate structures that substitute for
  properly sited recreational facilities or the collocation of unrelated military functions.
  Separate at ILD from other related PESs.
  12.16.5. Open, military only or other combatant-type training areas. Examples include areas
  used for Rapid Runway Repair, Security Force exercises, and areas used by CE Red Horse
  personnel. If areas include fixed facilities, including small classrooms designed for
  occasional use coincident with the use of the training area, apply incremental IBD with a
  minimum of PTRD to the facility. As an exception, to allow for realism in training, this
  separation does not apply to AE needed for any particular exercise or on-the-job training.
  However, this separation or equivalent protection is required from permanent PESs.
  12.16.6. Aircraft battle damage repair training areas.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  219


   12.16.7. Open-air aircraft passenger loading and unloading areas.
   12.16.8. Parking lots for administrative areas. See paragraph 12.67.2.
   12.16.9. Auxiliary storage located in the open (no structures involved) when not directly
   related to the explosives mission and when accessed by personnel not directly related to the
   explosives mission. (See paragraph 12.15.1.20. if located within a structure.) See
   paragraph 12.68.2.
   12.16.10. Unmanned antenna/antenna farms when not directly related to the explosives
   mission. These are facilities that generate electromagnetic radiation which may or may not
   pose a threat to EEDs. A greater distance may be required to protect EEDs at the PES. See
   Chapter 9 to determine safe separation distances. PTRD will be based on blast overpressure
   only; fragment distances will not be used.
   12.16.11. Unoccupied weather equipment (antennas, ceilometers, etc.) not exclusively
   supporting an explosives area and when located in the open. The PTRD will be based on
   overpressure only; fragment distances will not be used.
   12.16.12. Joint DoD-non-DoD use taxiway. A taxiway serving both DoD and commercial
   aircraft. A taxiway serving solely DoD, DoD chartered, or non-DoD aircraft on DoD
   authorized business is not joint use.
   12.16.13. Operating personnel exposed to explosives research, development and test
   operations that are conducted by remote control procedures will be provided protection as
   outlined in paragraph 4.17., 4.18.1. and 4.18.2. Non-operating personnel will be provided
   IBD protection.
   12.16.14. Land used for agricultural purposes.
      12.16.14.1. Apply PTRD without a minimum fragment distance for new PES locations
      or when a new site plan is required for an existing PES when the following conditions
      exist:
          12.16.14.1.1. When the exposure is frequent or higher (as described in Table 1.2
          Exposure). For example when manual methods and numerous laborers are needed for
          certain types of crops or locations.
          12.16.14.1.2. QD is not required when the exposure is determined to be occasional or
          lower. See Table 1.2.
      12.16.14.2. PES-ES relationships existing prior to the publication date of this AFMAN
      revision is not required to meet the above criteria.
12.17. Allowable Unbarricaded ILD Exposures. For the following situations, the use of
unbarricaded ILD may be used:
   12.17.1. Explosives operating locations (e.g., surveillance, maintenance, inspection) directly
   related to the PES; the PES may be an explosives storage or operating location. When
   necessary to conduct dissimilar concurrent operations, the operations must be arranged to
   provide a minimum of ILD protection either by distance or equivalent protection, or must be
   operations which do not require QD separation. MAJCOM supplements to this Manual will
   provide guidance on determining whether operations within a single facility require QD
   separation; factors to consider are:
220                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      12.17.1.1. Whether the same personnel are involved in both operations (e.g., AE workers
      are assigned to the same flight and will move between operations as required).
      12.17.1.2. Whether the same AE are involved in both operations (e.g., air-to-air missiles,
      chaff or flare).
      12.17.1.3. Whether the operations are the same type (e.g., inspection, buildup).
      12.17.1.4. Whether the AE involved in both operations presents similar hazards (e.g.,
      same HD or CG).
  12.17.2. Parallel operating lines, provided the AE involved in each operating line present
  similar hazards. (Note: The criticality or survivability of one or more of the operating lines
  may require that each line be given IBD-level protection.) Successive steps within a single
  explosives process or operation will be provided as much protection as practical, but do not
  require QD separation. If the successive steps are housed in separate facilities provide ILD
  separation between facilities.
  12.17.3. Non-explosives facilities, excluding magazine-area loading docks, that are used
  exclusively in support of a PES or explosives area. Such facilities include:
      12.17.3.1. Gatehouses.
      12.17.3.2. Field offices for branch or flight level supervision, Munitions Operations
      (AFK), munitions control, training, mobility, etc. (See paragraph 12.20.3.5 for offices of
      personnel who perform hands-on work and their first level supervisors.)
      12.17.3.3. Dunnage preparation.
      12.17.3.4. Small packing and shipping buildings.
      12.17.3.5. Dog kennels.
      12.17.3.6. Area security control (apply IBD to Base Defense Operations Center per
      paragraph 12.15.1.12).
      12.17.3.7. Motor pool dispatch points (for vehicles supporting storage area only).
      12.17.3.8. Staffed power plants and staffed non-explosive hazardous material collection
      points.
      12.17.3.9. Response force tactical facilities (RFTF).
      12.17.3.10. Lunch rooms.
      12.17.3.11. Break rooms and change houses supporting multiple PESs.
      12.17.3.12. Inert operations involving components of an explosive weapon system; the
      operation must involve support of an explosive operation such as repairing bomb fins, or
      the operation simulates an explosive operation.
      12.17.3.13. Auxiliary fire stations (apply IBD to main base support fire stations per
      paragraph 12.15.1.11.).
      12.17.3.14. Training facilities.
      12.17.3.15. Manned facilities of a defensive or tactical missile battery.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      221


     12.17.3.16. GCA, RAPCON, and air traffic control towers that support a military use
     only airfield from flight line PESs.
     12.17.3.17. Unmanned antenna/antenna farms. These are facilities that generate
     electromagnetic radiation which may or may not pose a threat to EEDs. A greater
     distance may be required to protect EEDs at the PES. See Chapter 9 to determine safe
     separation distances.
     12.17.3.18. Unoccupied weather equipment facilities from the explosives area being
     supported.
     12.17.3.19. Maintenance of military vehicles or equipment that are located outside the
     U.S., when the PES is a basic load or a ready storage area (see paragraph 13.11.). In
     such cases:
         12.17.3.19.1. The NEWQD at each PES is limited to 8,818 lbs or less.
         12.17.3.19.2. The maintenance work must be performed exclusively for the unit for
         which the AE is stored.
  12.17.4. Auxiliary power and utilities functions including auxiliary power plants;
  compressor stations; electric power transformers; tool and consumable supplies storage and
  issue; and handling equipment service, battery charging, and minor repair. When such
  facilities serve an entire base complex, or when loss of the facility will cause an immediate
  loss of vital function, the minimum exposure level will be IBD.
  12.17.5. Minimum distance between separate groups of AE-loaded, combat-configured
  aircraft. For QD purposes, all combat forces at a single location are considered related. This
  may include Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, and host nation aircraft. One set of QD
  criteria applies to all combat forces at a single location (e.g., facilities or functions related to
  Air Force fighter aircraft are also related to Navy fighter aircraft). When the services
  disagree on the required QD, forward the problem through MAJCOM channels to
  AFSC/SEW for action. The use of intervening barricades is required to eliminate
  propagation by primary fragment impact; thereby eliminating the need to total NEWQD.
  (Note: Loading AE aboard aircraft can be accomplished with each group of aircraft without
  additional protection.)
  12.17.6. Combat Aircraft Related Activities. See paragraph 12.40.
  12.17.7. Cargo Aircraft Related Activities. See paragraph 12.41.
  12.17.8. Munitions or Weapons Storage Area Related Activities. See paragraph 12.42.
  12.17.9. Parking areas for privately owned vehicles (POVs) supporting multiple PESs. See
  paragraph 12.67.3.
  12.17.10. Exposures that are provided blast suppression and structure hardening so that
  equivalent ILD protection for personnel and equipment is provided. Separate the following
  hardened facilities at reduced intraline (related facility) distance based upon their degree of
  hardening. Minimum separation distances for occupied facilities from HASs (see paragraph
  12.51.13.) still apply. Note: Provide definitive designs which justify reduced K-factor.
     12.17.10.1. Hardened Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Generation or Bulk Storage Facilities.
 222                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       12.17.10.2. Hardened POL Truck Shelters. (Use IBD for parking areas for fuel service
       trucks unrelated to the PES.)
       12.17.10.3. Hardened Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection
       Facility - K7.
       12.17.10.4. Hardened Squadron Operations Facility - K7.
       12.17.10.5. Hardened Response Force Tactical Facility (RFTF) - K9.
       12.17.10.6. Survivable Collective Protection System (SCPS) with a minimum of 5 feet
       earth cover - K3; with a minimum of 3 ft but less than 5 feet of earth cover - K5. Note:
       SCPS built before 1 September 1988 at less than minimum separation distances for
       occupied facilities from HASs (see paragraph 12.51.13.) do not require a waiver or
       exemption.
   12.17.11. Construction activities exposed by explosives facilities or operations. This
   separation requirement applies to all construction activities whether being accomplished by
   civilian, military, or host nation personnel. Document a risk assessment (see Chapter 4),
   including the control measures taken. Locally maintain the risk assessment documentation
   until operations have been completed and personnel have permanently vacated the work site.
   If this separation cannot be maintained, obtain a waiver per Section 1B.
12.18. Allowable Barricaded ILD Exposures.
   12.18.1. Continue to use K9 to properly barricade facilities sited at K9 before 1 June 1980
   until a revised siting of that facility is necessary, except as noted in paragraph 12.18.2.
   Comply with this Manual when resiting of such facilities is required.
   12.18.2. Use Barricaded ILD for the following facilities with barricades meeting the
   construction and location criteria of Section 6E, or from the side or rear of ECMs per
   paragraph 12.24.2:
       12.18.2.1. Occupied facilities of a defensive or tactical missile battery where greater
       distances from the PES cannot be provided for technical or tactical reasons.
       12.18.2.2. Field operations in magazine areas when performing minor maintenance,
       packaging or surveillance inspections (from adjacent magazines).
       12.18.2.3. Successive steps of a single production, renovation, or maintenance operation
       housed in separate facilities.
       12.18.2.4. A security alert force (apply IBD to central security control per paragraph
       12.15.1.12).
       12.18.2.5. Break rooms and change houses that are part of an operating line, used
       exclusively by personnel operating the line, and are not integral to the PES.
       12.18.2.6. Dunnage preparation or similar non-AE operations, if used only by personnel
       employed at the PES.
       12.18.2.7. Temporary holding areas for AE conveyances servicing production or
       maintenance facilities.
       12.18.2.8. Service magazines supporting an explosives operating location.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   223


   12.18.3. Unoccupied auxiliary utility functions (e.g., transformer stations, water treatment
   and pollution abatement facilities) that serve an explosives area, but are not an integral
   function in the explosives area, and that would not create an immediate secondary hazard if
   lost. Such unmanned facilities need not be barricaded.
12.19. Allowable IMD Exposures.
   12.19.1. Container stuffing and unstuffing operations in magazine areas that provide routine
   support to multiple PESs.
12.20. Other Allowable Exposures.
   12.20.1. Facilities that exclusively support an explosives area may be separated from the
   PESs in the explosives area as follows:
      12.20.1.1. Unmanned hazardous material collection points may be located at fire
      protection distance (50 ft for non-combustible structures, 100 ft for combustible
      structures).
      12.20.1.2. When essential for security purposes, site one-person guard towers at 50 feet
      (fire break distance) from explosives locations.
      12.20.1.3. Unmanned auxiliary power generation or conversion facilities (e.g., power
      plants, transformers, etc.) that exclusively supply power to an explosives area or security
      fence lighting may be located at fire protection distance (50 ft for non-combustible
      structures, 100 ft for combustible structures.
      12.20.1.4. Small latrines may be located at fire protection distance (50 ft for non-
      combustible structures, 100 ft for combustible structures). This facility type is limited to
      toilets and sinks and do not contain showers, clothing lockers, or other conveniences.
   12.20.2. The following facilities that exclusively support a single PES may be located at fire
   protection distance (50 ft for non-combustible structures, 100 ft for combustible structures)
   from the PES they support; provide separation to all other PESs:
      12.20.2.1. Transformers.
      12.20.2.2. Low pressure boilers. Some specially designed operating buildings have
      attached rooms for low-pressure boilers and other facilities. These buildings have safety
      features such as protective concrete separating walls (without openings) between boiler
      and working areas, light roof and frangible exterior walls for boiler enclosures. Such
      buildings, built according to Air Force definitive drawings, require no separation. This
      exception applies only where equipment installed or contained in attached rooms meets
      or exceeds original specifications and does not create additional hazards.
      12.20.2.3. Paint storage buildings.
      12.20.2.4. Auxiliary facilities such as heating plants, line offices, break areas, briefing
      rooms for daily work schedules or site safety matters, joiner shops, security posts, and
      similar functions.
   12.20.3. The following facilities require no QD or fire protection distance separation:
      12.20.3.1. One-person security structures for weapons-loaded aircraft; provide fire
      protection distance separation when possible.
 224                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       12.20.3.2. Guard (sentry) shelters.
       12.20.3.3. Defensive fighting positions.
       12.20.3.4. Break rooms, supply rooms, and change houses integral to a PES.
       12.20.3.5. Offices, integral to a PES, of personnel who perform hands-on work in the
       PES (e.g., assemble, maintain, inspect, and test), and the NCOIC and first level
       supervisors (crew chiefs) of those who do hands-on work.
   12.20.4. The following facilities require no QD but fire protection distance separation
   applies:
       12.20.4.1. Abandoned facilities.      These facilities may or may not be scheduled for
       demolition.

Section 12G—Hazard Zones for ECMs and HASs

12.21. Hazard Zones for ECMs and HASs. QD criteria for ECMs and HASs are dependent
upon the orientation of these PESs. The QD criteria in this Manual refer to ―front,‖ ―side,‖ and
―rear‖ relationships for ECMs and HASs.
   12.21.1. Use Figure 12.1 to determine whether an ES is exposed to the front, side or rear of
   an ECM.
       12.21.1.1. The forward sector, or ―front,‖ for an ECM is that area 60 degrees either side
       of the ECM's centerline (120 degrees combined angle), with the vertex of the angle
       placed so that the sides of the angle pass through the intersection of the headwall and
       sidewalls.
       12.21.1.2. The rear sector, or ―rear,‖ of an ECM is that area 45 degrees either side of the
       magazine centerline (90 degrees combined angle) with the vertex of the angle placed so
       that the sides of the angle pass through the intersection of the rear and side walls
       12.21.1.3. All other orientations are considered ―side‖ sectors.
   12.21.2. Use Figure 12.2 to determine ECM to ECM orientation effects on IMD.
   12.21.3. Use Figure 12.3 to determine whether an ES is exposed to the front, side or rear of a
   HAS.

Section 12H—HD 1.

12.22. HD 1.1 Hazardous Fragment Distances. The minimum distance for protection from
hazardous fragments will be based on primary and secondary fragments from the PES and the
population or traffic density of the ES. The hazardous fragment distance (HFD) is defined as the
distance at which the density of hazardous fragments becomes 1 per 600 ft2. (Note: This
distance is not the maximum fragment range.)
   12.22.1. The HFD may be determined by:
       12.22.1.1. Default values, such as those shown in Table 12.4 for primary fragments or
       Tables 12.4 and 12.10 secondary fragments.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     225


     12.22.1.2. Some items have been evaluated for minimum HFD with results shown in
     Table 12.5.
     12.22.1.3. Some items, through testing, have been hazard classified with a specific HFD
     presented in the format HD (xx)1.1. The HFD for these items is specified in hundreds of
     feet (in parenthesis). These items may or may not be listed in Table 12.5.
     12.22.1.4. DDESB-approved analyses and approved tests may be used to determine
     minimum distances for both primary and secondary fragments. DDESB TP 13,
     Prediction of Building Debris for Quantity-Distance Siting is an example of a method to
     determine minimal distances for building debris, while DDESB TP 16, Methodologies for
     Calculating Primary Fragment Characteristics and DDESB TP 10, Change 3,
     Methodology For Chemical Hazard Predictions provide similar information for primary
     fragments.
  12.22.2. Examples when minimum hazardous fragment and firebrand distances need not
  apply are:
     12.22.2.1. Recreation or training facilities when such facilities are located near AE
     support operations and are used by off-duty military or on-duty military or DoD civilians
     or contractors (e.g., munitions workers, security guards, firefighters) who directly support
     these AE operations.
     12.22.2.2. Related and support DoD-controlled functions for which IMD and ILD would
     normally apply.
     12.22.2.3. Maintenance, supply, training facilities, and operations offices for logistical or
     operational support of combat aircraft, battalion-size or smaller delivery or AE supply
     units, separate air defense firing batteries, or a single pier or wharf for which the AE in a
     PES is intended.
     12.22.2.4. Between a PES and inert storage, whether in a facility or in the open.
     12.22.2.5. Between facilities in an operating line; between operating lines; and between
     operating lines and storage locations.
  12.22.3. Minimum hazardous fragment distances apply to:
     12.22.3.1. An installation's boundary.
     12.22.3.2. Administration and housing areas.
     12.22.3.3. Recreation facilities (e.g., ball diamonds, golf courses and volleyball courts).
     (Note: See paragraph 12.22.2.1 for situations where minimum fragment distances do not
     apply to recreational facilities.)
     12.22.3.4. Flightline passenger service functions (e.g., terminal buildings).
     12.22.3.5. Utilities that provide vital functions to a major portion of an installation.
     12.22.3.6. Auxiliary storage and shops that by reason of their vital strategic nature, or
     high intrinsic value of their contents, should not be placed at risk.
     12.22.3.7. Functions that, if momentarily put out of action, would cause an immediate
     secondary hazard by reason of their failure to function.
 226                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       12.22.3.8. Privately owned vehicles parked in administrative areas.
12.23. HD 1.1 IBD and PTRD. Table 12.1 provides a summary matrix of all the paired
relationships for HD 1.1.
   12.23.1. For locations provided IBD or PTRD protection per paragraphs 12.15 and 12.16,
   the HD 1.1 IBD and PTRD will be as follows:
       12.23.1.1. HD 1.1 NEWQD < 450 lbs.
          12.23.1.1.1. For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD
          and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6.
          12.23.1.1.2. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density (NEWQD
          (lbs)/internal volume (ft3)) is < 0.028 lbs/ft3, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and
          PTRD as shown in Table 12.6.
          12.23.1.1.3. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is > 0.028
          lbs/ft3, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6 for side/rear
          exposures. For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the ECM Front IBD as shown
          in Table 12.6, the HFD found in Table 12.4, the specific item HFD as shown in
          Table 12.5, or the parenthetical fragment distance, whichever is greater. When using
          Table 12.4, use the ―Structure‖ column only if the ECM headwall meets the definition
          of AGS (H) as defined in the legend of Table 12.2 or for non-fragment producing
          explosives. PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
          12.23.1.1.4. Where ECM, regardless of structural designation, have been designed,
          analyzed, or tested to have a reduced IBD and PTRD and have been approved by the
          DDESB, use the approved IBD and PTRD.
          12.23.1.1.5. For HD 1.1 in a structure (excluding ECM) capable of stopping primary
          fragments, but which can contribute to the debris hazard, use the HFD listed in the
          ―Structure‖ column of Table 12.4 . PTRD is 60% of HFD. Structures that are
          capable of stopping primary fragments include all heavy wall (H) and heavy wall/roof
          (H/R) AGS, as defined in the Legend for Table 12.2. Doors and other openings
          through which primary fragments could exit must be capable of stopping primary
          fragments from exiting the facility or will be barricaded in accordance with Section
          6E to trap primary fragments that could exit the facility. All other structures (other
          than ECM) are considered incapable of stopping primary fragments.
          12.23.1.1.6. Selected items have been evaluated for minimum HFD with results
          shown in Table 12.5. Other items, through testing, have been hazard classified with a
          specific HFD presented in the format HD (xx)1.1. The HFD for these items is
          specified in hundreds of feet (in parenthesis), and may not be listed in Table 12.5. The
          HFD for these two categories apply only to items in the open. When in facilities,
          secondary debris as well as primary fragments must be considered. If in a facility
          incapable of stopping primary fragments, IBD is the greater of the HFD for Open
          locations as shown in Table 12.4, the specific item HFD as shown in table 12.5, or the
          parenthetical fragment distance. For items not listed in Table 12.5 or assigned a
          parenthetical fragment distance, use the ―Open‖ column of Table 12.4. PTRD is 60%
          of the resulting IBD.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                227


        12.23.1.1.7. For bare (non-fragment producing) explosives in any structure
        (excluding ECM), truck, trailer, or railcar that may contribute to the debris hazard,
        use the HFD listed in the ―Structure‖ column of Table 12.4. PTRD is 60% of HFD.
        12.23.1.1.8. For bare (non-fragment producing) explosives in the open, IBD is K40;
        PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
        12.23.1.1.9. For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2,
        IBD is K40; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
     12.23.1.2. HD 1.1 NEWQDs in the range 451 to 30,000 lbs.
        12.23.1.2.1. The minimum HFD will be 1250 ft. Facilities sited at 1,235 ft or 1,245
        ft per past standards will be considered to be in compliance with the 1,250 ft
        minimum requirement.
        12.23.1.2.2. For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD
        and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6.
        12.23.1.2.3. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is < 0.028
        lbs/ft3, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6.
        12.23.1.2.4. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM with minimum internal dimensions of
        26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table
        12.6, for side/rear exposures. For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the Other
        PES IBD as shown in Table 12.6, or the parenthetical fragment distance if it is greater
        than 1250 ft; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
        12.23.1.2.5. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is > 0.028
        lbs/ft3 and internal dimensions are less than 26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use Other PES
        IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6 for side and rear exposures. For front
        exposures, IBD is the greater of the Other PES IBD as shown in Table 12.6, or the
        parenthetical fragment distance if it is greater than 1250 ft; PTRD is 60% of the
        resulting IBD.
        12.23.1.2.6. For HD 1.1 in a structure (excluding ECM), use the Other PES IBD and
        PTRD distances as shown in Table 12.6. However, if the item has a parenthetical
        fragment distance that is greater than 1250 ft, use the parenthetical fragment distance
        as the IBD; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
        12.23.1.2.7. For HD 1.1 in the open, use the Other PES IBD and PTRD distances as
        shown in Table 12.6. However, if the item has a parenthetical fragment distance or a
        specific item HFD distance as shown in Table 12.5, this value may be used in place of
        the 1250 ft minimum HFD. IBD is the greater of K40, or the parenthetical fragment
        distance or specific item HFD as shown in Table 12.5; PTRD is 60% of the resulting
        IBD.
        12.23.1.2.8. For bare (non-fragment producing) explosives in the open, IBD is K40;
        PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
        12.23.1.2.9. For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2,
        IBD is K40; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
     12.23.1.3. HD 1.1 NEWQDs > 30,000 lbs.
 228                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


          12.23.1.3.1. For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM where internal dimensions are a
          minimum of 26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use ECM IBD and PTRD as shown in Table
          12.6.
          12.23.1.3.2. For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM where internal dimensions are
          less than 26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use Other PES IBD and PTRD as shown in Table
          12.6 for front, side and rear exposures.
          12.23.1.3.3. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where internal dimensions are a
          minimum of 26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown
          in Table 12.6 for side/rear exposures. For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the
          Other PES IBD as shown in Table 12.6, or the parenthetical fragment distance if it is
          greater than 1250 ft; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
          12.23.1.3.4. For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where internal dimensions are less
          than 26 ft wide and 60 ft long, use Other PES IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6
          for side/rear exposures. For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the Other PES IBD
          as shown in Table 12.6, or the parenthetical fragment distance if it is greater than
          1250 ft; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
          12.23.1.3.5. For HD 1.1 in a structure (excluding ECM) or in the open, use the Other
          PES IBD and PTRD distances as shown in Table 12.6. However, if the item has a
          parenthetical fragment distance that is greater than 1250 ft, use the parenthetical
          fragment distance as the IBD; PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
          12.23.1.3.6. For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2,
          IBD is K40/50 as described in Table 12.6, note 3. PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD.
12.24. HD 1.1 ILD. Table 12.1 provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for
HD 1.1.
   12.24.1. Unbarricaded ILD from an ECM. Testing has shown that some attenuation of
   airblast overpressure relative to an unconfined surface burst occurs out the sides and rear of
   an ECM and a slight increase occurs out the front of an ECM. The equivalent K18
   unbarricaded ILD from an ECM, when accounting for this attenuation, is as shown in Table
   12.7 for exposures permitted at unbarricaded ILD per paragraph 12.17. (Note: Airblast
   forms the bases for the equations given in the notes to Table 12.7.) Note: Per paragraph
   12.17.10, some hardened structures may be sited at a reduced unbarricaded ILD.
   12.24.2. Barricaded ILD from an ECM. The equivalent K9 barricaded ILD from an ECM is
   as shown in Table 12.7 for exposures permitted at barricaded ILD per paragraph 12.18. Use
   of barricaded ILD from the front of an ECM requires that a properly constructed, intervening
   barricade be located between the ES and the PES. This barricade must meet the construction
   and location criteria of Section 6E. If an ECM's earth cover meets all construction criteria of
   Section 6E, it will qualify as a barricade and use of barricaded ILD from the sides or rear of
   the ECM is permissible. Failure of the ECM's earth cover to meet the criteria of Section 6E
   will require use of unbarricaded ILD siting purposes.
   12.24.3. Unbarricaded ILD from Other than an ECM. The unbarricaded ILD from all PESs
   other than ECMs is as shown in Table 12.8 for exposures permitted at unbarricaded ILD per
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   229


   paragraph 12.17. Note: Per paragraph 12.17.10, some hardened structures may be sited at a
   reduced unbarricaded ILD.
   12.24.4. Barricaded ILD from Other than an ECM. The barricaded ILD from all PESs other
   than ECMs is as shown in Table 12.8 for exposures permitted at barricaded ILD per
   paragraph 12.18. Use of barricaded ILD requires that a properly constructed, intervening
   barricade be located between the ES and the PES. This barricade must meet the construction
   and location criteria of Section 6E.
12.25. HD 1.1 IMD. IMD from magazines is as shown in Table 12.1. The IM distances given
for 100 lbs NEW in tables 12.30. and 12.31. constitute the minimum magazine separations
permitted.
   12.25.1. Barricaded IMD from an ECM. Use of barricaded IMD from the front of an ECM
   requires that a properly constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the
   PES. This barricade must meet the construction and location criteria of Section 6E. If an
   ECM's earth cover meets all construction criteria of Section 6E, it will qualify as a barricade
   and use of barricaded IMD from the sides or rear of the ECM is permissible. Failure of the
   ECM's earth cover to meet the criteria of Section 6E will require use of unbarricaded IMD
   siting purposes.
      12.25.2. Barricaded IMD from an AGM. Use of barricaded IMD from an AGM requires
      that a properly constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the PES.
      This barricade must meet the construction and location criteria of Section 6E.

Section 12I—HD 1.2 QD Criteria

12.26. HD 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 QD Criteria.
   12.26.1. Small quantities of HD 1.2.1 (< 450 pounds NEWQD), in certain packaging
   configurations, will react in a manner more typical of an HD 1.1 event. When located in
   structures that stop primary fragments, but which generate a secondary debris hazard (e.g.
   certain ECM and hardened structures), the structural damage and debris hazards produced
   from these events are more characteristic of an HD 1.1 explosion, rather than the progressive
   nature of an HD 1.2.1 event. When the NEWQD and the MCE of the packaged HD 1.2.1
   items fall within the ranges specified in the equation NEWQD < MCE < 450 lbs (which
   means that there will only be a single HD 1.2.1 event and it will involve less than or equal to
   450 lbs), the HD 1.2.1 will be treated as HD 1.1 and the criteria of paragraph 12.23.1.1 will
   be used.
   12.26.2. The QD criteria for HD 1.2.1 items are based on the hazards from primary
   fragments and secondary debris. Structures that may contribute secondary debris include:
   frontal exposures from ECMs; cargo aircraft (with internally loaded AE); all above ground
   structures, including heavy wall (H), heavy wall/roof (H/R), and light wall (L) as defined in
   Table 12.2; trucks, trailers, and railcars (with internally loaded AE). All structures are
   presumed to produce secondary debris unless data or analyses are provided, and approved by
   AFSC/SEW, to show that the structural debris contribution is less than that shown in Table
   12.10. Secondary debris evaluation is not required for externally-loaded AE on aircraft, and
   stacks of AE on open trucks, trailers, or railcars.
 230                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.26.3. The QD criteria for HD 1.2.2 items are based on the hazards from primary
   fragments.
   12.26.4. Table 12.2 provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.2.1
   and 1.2.2.
       12.26.4.1. HD 1.2.1 IBD in the open is given in Table 12.9. When HD 1.2.1 items are
       stored in structures that may contribute to the debris hazard, the IBD is determined by
       using the larger of the following two distances: either that given in Table 12.9 for the
       appropriate Explosive Weight (number of items x NEWQD) or that given in Table 12.10
       for the appropriate MCE. (Note: Hazardous debris distance (HDD) specified in Table
       12.10 equates to IBD.)
       12.26.4.2. HD 1.2.2 IBD is given in Table 12.11.
       12.26.4.3. PTRD given in Tables 12.9 through 12.11 give consideration to the transient
       nature of the exposure in the same manner as for HD 1.1. PTRD is computed as 60% of
       the IBD for items in this HD, with minimum distances specified in Table 12.2.
       12.26.4.4. ILD given in Tables 12.9 through 12.11 take into account the progressive
       nature of explosions involving these items (normally resulting from fire spread), up to the
       magnitude of the MCE, and the ability to evacuate personnel from endangered areas
       before the progression involves large numbers of items. Exposed structures may be
       extensively damaged by projections and delayed propagation of explosions may occur
       due to the ignition of combustibles by projections. ILD is computed as 36% of the IBD
       for items of this HD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD given in Table 12.2 for
       the applicable PES-ES combination.
       12.26.4.5. IMD given in Table 12.2 are dependent upon the types of structures acting as
       both the PES and the ES.
12.27. HD 1.2.3 QD Criteria.
   12.27.1. When siting HD 1.2.3, cap the NEWQD of the largest single round at < 450
   pounds, and cap the parenthetical fragment distance (xx) at 1300 feet. These caps are for
   simplicity in siting and may be exceeded with AFSC/SEW approval.
       12.27.2. Table 12.2 provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD
       1.2.3.
          12.27.2.1. The IBD for HD 1.2.3 is determined using Table 12.12 (HD 1.3 QD) for
          the NEWQD of the HD 1.2.3 item multiplied by the number of rounds present, but
          with a minimum IBD determined as follows:
          12.27.2.1.1. If the items are in a heavy structure that can interrupt primary fragments
          and can contribute secondary debris (including side/rear exposures from ECMs), the
          minimum IBD is the hazardous debris distance given in Table 12.10 for an MCE
          equal to the NEWQD of the largest single round. A heavy structure is defined as a
          structure with wall thickness >12 inches of reinforced concrete and a roof thickness
          >5.9 inches of reinforced concrete.
          12.27.2.1.2. If the items are in a structure that will not interrupt primary fragments
          and can contribute to the debris hazard including frontal exposures from unbarricaded
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 231


          ECMs , the minimum IBD applied is the greater of either the debris distance given in
          Table 12.10. for an MCE equal to the NEWQD of the largest single round or
          parenthetical (xx) fragment distance assigned to the HD 1.2.3 item to be stored. All
          structures are assumed to create secondary debris unless data or analyses are
          provided, and approved by AFSC/SEW, to show that the structural debris
          contribution is less than that shown in Table 12.10.
          12.27.2.1.3. If the items are in the open the minimum IBD is the greatest
          parenthetical (xx) fragment distance assigned to the HD 1.2.3 item to be stored.
          12.27.2.1.4. As an alternative to the criteria in paragraphs 12.27.2.1.1 through
          12.27.2.1.3, when an increase in the allowable quantity or a reduction in the required
          distance will result, HD 1.2.3 AE may be treated as follows:
              12.27.2.1.4.1. If the largest single round NEWQD is > 1.6 lbs, consider the items
              as HD 1.2.1. Use the total NEWQD present, with an MCE equal to the NEWQD
              of the largest single round to determine the maximum QD.
              12.27.2.1.4.2. If the largest single round NEWQD is < than 1.6 lbs, consider the
              items as HD 1.2.2, based on the total NEWQD present.
       12.27.2.2. PTR and IL for HD 1.2.3 are computed as 60% and 36%, respectively, of the
       determined IBD, with a minimum distance equal to IMD given in Table 12.2.

Section 12J—HD 1.3 QD Criteria

12.28. HD 1.3 QD Criteria. Table 12.3 provides a summary matrix of all the paired
relationships for HD 1.3. Table 12.12 provides QD criteria for HD 1.3. HD 1.3 includes items
that burn vigorously with little or no possibility of extinguishment in storage situations.
Explosions normally will be confined to pressure ruptures of containers and will not produce
propagating shock waves or damaging blast overpressure beyond the magazine distance
specified in Table 12.12. A severe fire hazard may result from tossing about of burning
container materials, propellant, or other flaming debris.

Section 12K—HD 1.4 QD Criteria

12.29. HD 1.4 QD Criteria.
   12.29.1. Table 12.3 provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.4.
   Table 12.13 provides QD criteria for HD 1.4. HD 1.4 AE present a fire hazard with minimal
   blast, fragmentation, or toxic hazards.
   12.29.2. In mixed storage, the NEWQD of HD 1.4 is not additive (see paragraph 12.7.1.1).
   However, QD criteria for each HD present, including HD 1.4, must be determined and the
   largest value will be used.
   12.29.3. HD 1.4S AE (see paragraph 2.23) may be stored (including associated handling)
   without regard to the QD criteria in Table 12.13.

Section 12L—HD 1.6 QD Criteria
 232                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


12.30. HD 1.6 QD Criteria. Table 12.3 provides a summary matrix of all the paired
relationships for HD 1.6. Table 12.14 provides QD criteria for HD 1.6. QD separations for HD
1.6 AE will be based on the storage location and configuration. A maximum of 500,000 lbs
NEWQD will be permitted at any one location. Any special storage configuration and siting
approved for HD 1.1 AE may be used for storage of like explosive weights of HD 1.6 AE.

Section 12M—HD 6.1 Criteria

12.31. HD 6.1 Criteria.
   12.31.1. HD 6.1 includes items that contain only toxic chemical or riot control agents. AE
   containing both explosives and toxic chemical or riot control agents may be hazard classified
   as HD 1.1 through HD 1.4, based on testing in accordance with Title 49 Code of Federal
   Regulations, Parts 171 to 177, Shippers-General Requirements for Shipments and Packaging.
   12.31.2. Hazard zones for toxic chemical agents are determined by the relative toxicity of
   the agents, the amount released to the atmosphere and the rate at which they are released
   (that is, evaporation, pressure, or explosive dispersal), terrain features, and meteorological
   conditions. Hazard zone calculations are based on MCE, using DDESB TP 10, Methodology
   for Chemical Hazard Prediction.
   12.31.3. When siting AE containing toxic chemical agents, both the explosives and toxic
   chemical agent hazards will be evaluated with the greatest QD governing siting.

Section 12N—Energetic Liquids QD Criteria

12.32. Scope and Application.
   12.32.1. This section applies to the storage of energetic liquids, listed in Table 12.15, in all
   types of containers, including rocket and missile tankage. Laboratory quantities will be
   stored and handled as prescribed in Chapter 5 of AFOSH Standard 91-38, Hydrocarbon
   Fuels--General. (Note: The required QD are only based on the energetic liquids’ energetic
   reaction–that is, blast overpressure and container fragmentation. These QD requirements do
   not consider the toxicity or potential down-wind hazard. Therefore, QD may not be the only
   factor that needs to be considered when selecting a location for storage and operations of
   energetic liquids.)
   12.32.2. Exclusion. This section does not govern the storage or handling of energetic
   liquids for uses other than in space launch vehicles, rockets, missiles, associated static test
   apparatus, and AE.
12.33. Concept.
   12.33.1. These QD standards were developed on the premise that construction materials are
   compatible with energetic liquids, facilities are of appropriate design, fire protection and
   drainage control techniques are employed, and other specialized controls (e.g., nitrogen
   padding, blanketing, and tank cooling) are used, when required.
   12.33.2. When additional hazards associated with AE are involved, the safety distances
   prescribed in other sections of this standard will be applied, as required.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     233


   12.33.3. These standards are based upon the estimated credible damage resulting from an
   incident, without considering probabilities or frequency of occurrence.
12.34. Determination of Energetic Liquids Quantity.
   12.34.1. The total quantity of energetic liquids in a tank, drum, cylinder, or other container
   will be the net weight of the energetic liquids contained therein. Quantity of energetic liquids
   in the associated piping must be included to the points that positive means are provided for
   interrupting the flow through the pipe, or interrupting a reaction in the pipe in the event of an
   incident.
   12.34.2. When the quantities of energetic liquids are given in gallons, the conversion factors
   given in Table 12.16 may be used to determine the quantity in pounds.
12.35. Measurement of Separation Distances.
   12.35.1. Measure from the closest controlling hazard source (e.g., containers, buildings,
   segment, or positive cutoff point in piping).
   12.35.2. Measure from the nearest container or controlling sub-division, when buildings
   containing a small number of cylinders or drums are present or when quantities of energetic
   liquids are subdivided effectively.
12.36. Hazard Classification of Energetic Liquids.
   12.36.1. The main UN hazard classification designators for energetic liquids are indicated
   below. (Note: The original liquid propellant Hazard Groups I - IV and CG A - F are no
   longer used.)
      12.36.1.1. Class 1: Explosives.
      12.36.1.2. Class 2: Compressed or liquefied gases.
      12.36.1.3. Class 3: Flammable liquids.
      12.36.1.4. Class 4: Flammable solids and self-reactive materials.
      12.36.1.5. Class 5: Oxidizers.
      12.36.1.6. Class 6: Toxic or infectious substances.
      12.36.1.7. Class 8: Corrosive.
      12.36.1.8. Class 9: Miscellaneous.
   12.36.2. Because two energetic liquids might each be compatible with certain explosive AE
   stores, but incompatible with each other, a two-part compatibility group designation is
   assigned to an energetic liquid. (Note: The design and logistics of modern weapons
   sometimes require that consideration be given to permitting storage or operations involving
   energetic liquids in a storage structure containing solid explosives. For example, it may be
   necessary to store hydrocarbon-fueled cruise missiles having high explosive warheads with
   fueled configurations not containing explosive warheads. Another example is the storage of
   liquid gun propellant with explosive AE components.)
      12.36.2.1. The first element is the standard storage and transportation CG designation.
      The alpha designations are the same as the CG designations for UN Class 1 as given in
      Chapter 3. However, for storage and handling on DoD facilities, a CG may also be
234                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      assigned to an energetic liquid in a Class other than Class 1. The absence of a CG
      indicates incompatibility with solid explosives.
      12.36.2.2. The second element is a new Energetic Liquid Compatibility Group (ELCG)
      designation. The ELCG applies to mixed storage of energetic liquids or AE containing
      energetic liquids. The ELCG is specified in parentheses as the last element of the hazard
      classification. The ELCG designations and definitions are:
         12.36.2.2.1. LA: Energetic liquids that are strong oxidizers, mainly of acidic
         character. These materials may cause or contribute to the combustion of other
         material, possibly resulting in serious flare fires or explosions. Includes, but is not
         limited to, nitrogen tetroxide and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON), inhibited red
         fuming nitric acid (IRFNA), liquid oxygen (LO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and
         gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above.
         12.36.2.2.2. LB: Energetic liquids that are readily combustible when exposed to, or
         ignited in the presence of an oxidizing agent, but that are not strong reducing agents.
         Some may be hypergolic with group LA materials. Includes, but is not limited to,
         hydrocarbons such as kerosene’s and strained ring ramjet fuels; liquid hydrogen
         (LH2); and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above.
         12.36.2.2.3. LC: Energetic liquids that are readily combustible when exposed to, or
         ignited in the presence of an oxidizing agent, and are also strong reducing agents.
         These will likely be hypergolic with group LA substances. Includes, but is not
         limited to, hydrazine’s and other amines; and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above.
         12.36.2.2.4. LD: Energetic liquids that act mainly as combustible fuels, similar to
         groups LB and LC, when exposed to, or ignited in the presence of oxidizing agents
         but that may act as oxidizers in some combinations. They may be a monopropellant
         with the right catalyst, or may be pyrophoric and ignite upon release to the
         atmosphere. Examples are ethylene and propylene oxides, and boranes.
         12.36.2.2.5. LE: Energetic liquids having characteristics that do not permit storage
         with any other energetic liquid. They may react adversely with either fuels (reducing
         agents) or oxidizers. Examples are nitromethane, nitrate ester based formulations
         such as Otto Fuel II, liquid monopropellants containing hydroxyl ammonium nitrate
         (HAN), halogen fluorides (ClF3 and ClF5) and fluorine, and gels, slurries, or
         emulsions of the above.
      12.36.2.3. Mixing of energetic liquids.
         12.36.2.3.1. Different energetic liquids in the same ELCG may be stored together.
         12.36.2.3.2. ELCG-LE may not be mixed with other ELCG or dissimilar ELCG-LE.
         12.36.2.3.3. Mixed storage is prohibited between energetic liquids of different ELCG
         designations with one exception.
             12.36.2.3.3.1. ELCG-LB and -LC should not be stored together, particularly
             when the majority of the material stored is ELCG-LB; however, mixed storage of
             ELCG-LB and -LC is permitted when operationally necessary.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   235


     12.36.2.4. As an example, for the 1.3C(LE) hazard classification for HAN-based liquid
     gun propellant XM-46:
         12.36.2.4.1. "C": indicates the propellant can be stored in the same magazine with
         CG-C solid propellants. Because CG-C and CG-D can be mixed, CG-D high
         explosive projectiles could also be stored with the energetic liquid gun propellant.
         12.36.2.4.2. "LE": indicates that hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., JP-10), which is an ELCG-
         LB, would not be permitted in this storage scenario, because its ELCG-LB indicates
         incompatibility with ELCG-LE.
  12.36.3. Complete DoD hazard classification assignments for current energetic liquids are
  shown in Table 12.15. (Note: Conversions for gallons of energetic liquids to pounds is
  provided in Table 12.16.)
  12.36.4. Each new energetic liquid, or new non-bulk packaging configuration of an energetic
  liquid, developed or adopted for DoD use, must be examined and assigned a hazard
  classification per Technical Bulletin 700-2, Naval Sea Systems Command Instruction
  8020.8B, T.O. 11A-1-47, Defense Logistics Agency Regulations 8220.1, and Department of
  Defense Ammunitions and Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures. The MAJCOM
  developing a liquid propellant (or first adopting for use any liquid propellant not listed here)
  must recommend the hazard classification and compatibility group designation. The
  responsible MAJCOM will forward substantiated proposals for such assignments as soon as
  systems application planning allows or warrants to AFSC/SEW.
  12.36.5. A different minimum distance may be assigned during the hazard classification
  process when the hazards of a particular new packaging configuration are not adequately
  addressed. This distance will be indicated parenthetically, in hundreds of feet, as the first
  element of the hazard classification. For example, if a new liquid oxidizer pressure vessel
  configuration is hazard classified as (04)2.2(LA), then a minimum distance of 400 ft would
  apply for IBD and PTRD, otherwise the prescribed liquid oxidizer QD criteria would apply.
  12.36.6. Specific hazardous locations. The predominant hazard of the individual energetic
  liquids at specific hazardous locations can vary depending upon the location of the energetic
  liquid storage and the operations involved. These locations are listed below in the order of
  decreasing hazards.
     12.36.6.1. Launch pads. Operations at these facilities are very hazardous because of the
     proximity of fuel and oxidizer to each other, the frequency of launchings, lack of restraint
     of the vehicle after liftoff, and the possibility of fallback with resultant dynamic mixing
     on impact. To compute the explosive equivalent for the launch pad, use Table 12.17 with
     the combined energetic liquids weight in the launch vehicle tanks and any energetic
     liquids in piping that are subject to mixing, except as indicated in paragraph 12.36.8.
     12.36.6.2. Static test stands. Operations at these facilities are less hazardous because
     test items are restrained and subject to better control than launch vehicles. As with
     launch pads, the proximity of fuel and oxidizer presents a significant hazard. To reduce
     this hazard, tankage should be separated and remotely located from the static test stand.
     Explosive equivalents of Table 12.17 will be used, with the combined energetic liquids
     weight subject to mixing as determined by hazard analysis. The amount of energetic
236                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      liquids held in run tanks can be excluded from consideration if the test stand meets all the
      following criteria, if applicable:
         12.36.6.2.1. All tanks are American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
         certified in accordance with Wilton, C., ―Investigation of the Explosive Potential of
         the Hybrid Propellant Combinations N2O4/PBAN and CTF/PBAN,‖ AFRPL-TR-67-
         124, 1967 and maintained per ASME Code, section VIII, division 1 or division 2.
         12.36.6.2.2. For cryogenic propellants, all tanks are constructed with double wall
         jacketing.
         12.36.6.2.3. Run tankage is protected from fragments produced by an engine
         malfunction.
         12.36.6.2.4. Both the fuel and oxidizer lines contain two (redundant), remotely
         operated valves to shut off flow in the event of a malfunction.
  12.36.7. Ready storage. This storage is relatively close to the launch and static test stands;
  normally it is not involved directly in feeding the engine as in the case with run tankage,
  which is an integral part of all launch and test stand operations. The explosive equivalents of
  Table 12.17 will be used with the combined energetic liquids weight subject to mixing if the
  facility design does not guarantee against fuel and oxidizer mixing and against detonation
  propagation to, or initiation at, the ready storage facility when a mishap occurs at the test
  stand, on the ground at the launch pad, or at the ready storage areas. Otherwise, fire and
  fragment hazards will govern (Tables 12.15, 12.18, 12.19, 12.20, and 12.21).
  12.36.8. Cold-flow test operations. Fire and fragment hazards govern (Tables 12.15, 12.18,
  12.19, 12.20, and 12.21) if the design is such that the system is closed except for approved
  venting, is completely airtight, fuel and oxidizer never are employed concurrently, and each
  has a completely separate isolated system and fitting types to preclude intermixing, and the
  energetic liquids are of required purity. Otherwise, explosive equivalents (Table 12.17) will
  be used with the combined energetic liquids weight.
  12.36.9. Bulk storage. This is the most remote storage with respect to launch and test
  operations. It consists of the area, tanks, and other containers therein, used to hold energetic
  liquids for supplying ready storage and, indirectly, run tankage where no ready storage is
  available. Fire and fragment hazards govern (Tables 12.15, 12.18, 12.19, 12.20, and 12.21)
  except in special cases as indicated in Tables 12.15 and 12.17.
  12.36.10. Rest storage. This is temporary-type storage and most closely resembles bulk
  storage. It is a temporary parking location for barges, trailers, tank cars, and portable hold
  tanks used for topping operations when these units actually are not engaged in the operation;
  and for such vehicles when they are unable to empty their cargo promptly into the intended
  storage container. Fire and fragment hazards govern (Tables 12.15, 12.18, 12.19, 12.20, and
  12.21) except in special cases as indicated in Tables 12.15 and 12.17. The transporter
  becomes a part of that storage to which it is connected during energetic liquids transfer.
  12.36.11. Run tankage (operating tankage). This consists of the tank and other containers
  and associated piping used to hold the energetic liquids for direct feeding into the engine or
  device during operation. The contents of properly separated "run tanks" (operating tankage)
  and piping are normally considered on the basis of the pertinent hazards for the materials
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      237


   involved, except for quantities of incompatible materials that are or can be in a position to
   become mixed. Explosive equivalents will be used (Table 12.17) for quantities of such
   materials subject to mixing unless provisions of paragraphs 12.36.6.2.1 through 12.36.6.2.4
   are satisfied.
   12.36.12. Pipelines. A 25-ft clear zone to inhabited buildings will be maintained, as a
   minimum, on each side of pipelines used for energetic liquids (excluding flammable or
   combustible liquids that exhibit normal fire hazards such as RP-1, JP-10, and Otto Fuel II).
   Tables 12.15, 12.19, 12.20, and 12.21 apply, as appropriate.
12.37. QD Standards. Since many energetic liquids are not classified as UN Class 1
explosives, conventional QD storage criteria do not generally apply to these materials. At the
same time, the (non-Class 1) UN transportation hazard classifications for many energetic liquids
appear to be inappropriate or inadequate for application to storage safety (based on available
accident and test data). For example, hydrazine has a UN hazard classification of 8 (corrosive),
while it also is subject to dangerous fire and explosive behavior. Thus, the implementation of
QD criteria for energetic liquids is based on an independent determination of the predominant
hazard presented by the material in the storage environment. The following standards are
applicable to energetic liquids used for propulsion or operation of missiles, rockets, and other
related devices.
   12.37.1. Tables 12.15, 12.18, 12.19, 12.20, and 12.21 provide minimum distance
   requirements for storage of bulk quantities, and in some cases, pressure vessels and other
   commercial packaging of energetic liquids. In general, the minimum distance required by
   the material requiring the greatest distance will separate storage of different energetic liquids.
   In addition, positive measures will be taken to control the flow of energetic liquids in the
   event of a leak or spill, in order to prevent possible fire propagation or accumulation of
   flammable liquids near other storage, and to prevent mixing of incompatible energetic liquids
   (except for specific hazardous locations as identified in paragraph 12.36.6 above).
   Explosives equivalence applies for some materials as indicated in Tables 12.15 and 12.17.
   Fragment hazards govern for some materials in certain packaging configurations. For the
   more conventional fuels and oxidizers, and also where minimum blast and fragment criteria
   are not required due to low confinement packaging, QD standards are adopted from
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and NFPA guidelines to account for
   normal fire protection principles.
   12.37.2. For specific hazardous locations as defined in paragraph 12.36.6 above, explosives
   equivalency may apply. If so, consult Tables 12.15 and 12.17 with the combined energetic
   liquids weight subject to mixing and use distances found in Table 12.6 or 12.8. Enter weight
   of explosives equivalent in Table 12.6 or 12.8. QD standards for other conditions and
   explosive equivalents for any combination not contained in Table 12.15 or 12.17 will be
   determined by AFSC.
12.38. Contaminated Energetic Liquids.
   12.38.1. Caution will be exercised in the storage and handling of contaminated energetic
   liquids. Such contamination may increase the degree of hazard associated with the energetic
   liquids.
 238                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.38.2. Energetic liquids known to be contaminated or in a suspect condition will be
   isolated and provided separate storage from all other energetic liquids pending laboratory
   analysis for verification of contamination and disposition requirements, if any.

   required, address the status of the deviations in the ESP transmittal letter.
   12.39.2. Forward Firing Munitions. Weapon systems such as guns, rockets, missiles, and
   flare dispensers pose an additional hazard (beyond their explosives hazard) because of their
   directional response and potential long range if inadvertently activated on the ground. QD
   requirements do not address this additional hazard. Comply with the following to minimize
   this additional hazard:
       12.39.2.1. Position aircraft to present the minimum hazard to personnel and resources in
       the event of a mishap.
       12.39.2.2. Do not unnecessarily stand or park vehicles in front of, or behind, these
       munitions when power is applied to the aircraft.
       12.39.2.3. Comply with AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program for
       PNAF missions.
   12.39.3. AE Prohibited Areas. Areas immediately beyond the ends of runways and along
   primary flight paths are subject to more aircraft accidents than other areas. For this reason,
   AE is prohibited from Accident Potential Zones (APZ) I and II and clear zones (CZ) of all
   aircraft landing facilities as depicted and described in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
   Planning and Design and defined by the MAJCOM’s.
       12.39.3.1. Deviations to AE prohibited areas will be accomplished through risk
       acceptance documentation according to paragraph 1.4. ESP submittals must reference
       the approved airfield waiver as supporting justification for the deviation.
   12.39.4. Munitions Loading Operations. Uploading and downloading of munitions will be
   conducted at sited explosives-loaded aircraft parking areas (see paragraph 12.47).
12.40. Combat Aircraft Related Activities.
   12.40.1. All facilities and functions directly involved in maintaining, servicing, controlling,
   and flying combat aircraft are considered related to AE on the flight line supporting those
   combat aircraft and may be sited at ILD from such AE (subject to minimum separation
   distances from HASs as specified in paragraph 12.51.13. and to guidance given in para
   12.40.5). The primary test to be applied in determining combat aircraft related facilities is
   that the function must provide essential daily and direct support for the PES presenting the
   hazard. Examples of facilities and functions generally considered related to combat aircraft
   generation include:
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     239


       12.40.1.1. Facilities that handle AE on the flight line, prepare and service armed aircraft,
       and those that house personnel who fly combat aircraft (e.g., alert crew shelters).
       12.40.1.2. Direct flight line combat aircraft associated facilities, which may contain field
       offices, break rooms, unit training rooms, and equipment and supply rooms.
       12.40.1.3. Maintenance Group and Operations Group functions.
       12.40.1.4. POL or LOX servicing facilities, including hot pit refueling areas.
       12.40.1.5. Civil engineering functions solely dedicated to maintaining the runway and
       taxiways.
       12.40.1.6. Forward supply points.
       12.40.1.7. Intelligence, debriefing, and flightline security functions.
   12.40.2. Because combat aircraft generation cannot progress without their combined efforts,
   combat aircraft support functions and facilities involving explosives may be considered
   related to each other, if they are considered related to the combat aircraft. Therefore, all
   explosives support functions and facilities deemed related to combat aircraft generation
   activities on the flight line may be located at ILD from one another (subject to minimum
   separation distances from HASs as specified in paragraph 12.51.13).
   12.40.3. Combat aircraft related facilities must be separated from any PES they are not
   related to by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance. If combat aircraft related facilities
   are located in a HAS, this separation from unrelated PESs may be reduced to K30 to the
   frontal cone and K9 or K18 to the sides or rear. Some hardened facilities may be sited at
   lesser distances if equivalent protection is demonstrated by test or analysis and approved by
   AFSC/SEW.
   12.40.4. Other flight line facilities or activities which do not directly support combat aircraft
   generation will be separated by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, from combat
   aircraft and their related explosives operations.
   12.40.5. Typical munitions storage area explosives operations located on the flight line (e.g.
   bomb build-up) may be considered related to combat aircraft, but are not necessarily related
   to other combat aircraft related facilities or flight line support functions (e.g. wheel and tire
   shop).
   12.40.6. Flightline Dining Facilities. IBD with a minimum fragment distance from all PES
   locations is required whenever access to the dining facility is available to personnel who do
   not directly support flightline activities. IBD with no minimum fragment distance
   from MSA PES locations provided the dining facility is used exclusively by flight line
   personnel. ILD from flight line PES locations provided the dining facility is used by
   personnel who directly support flight line activities.
12.41. Explosives Cargo Aircraft Related Activities.
   12.41.1. Flight line personnel who solely support explosives cargo aircraft and all munitions
   maintenance activities are considered related to explosives cargo and explosives cargo
   aircraft and may be separated at ILD from such AE.
 240                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.41.2. Explosives cargo aircraft support functions and facilities involving explosives may
   be considered related to each other, if they are consider related to explosives cargo aircraft.
   Therefore, all explosives support functions and facilities deemed related to explosives cargo
   aircraft activities on the flight line may be located at ILD from one another.
   12.41.3. Explosives cargo aircraft related facilities must be separated from any PES they are
   not related to by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance.
   12.41.4. Other flight line facilities or activities which do not directly support explosives
   cargo aircraft operations and maintenance will be separated by IBD, with no minimum
   fragment distance, from explosives cargo aircraft.
   12.41.5. Typical munitions storage area explosives operations located on the flight line may
   be considered related to explosives cargo aircraft, but are not necessarily related to other
   explosives cargo aircraft related facilities or flight line support functions.
12.42. Munitions or Weapons Storage Area Related Activities.
   12.42.1. Activities directly associated with munitions storage or munitions operations are
   considered related to munitions storage area AE and may be separated at ILD from such AE.
   12.42.2. Munitions support functions and facilities involving explosives may be considered
   related to each other (regardless of owning service, organization or country), if they are
   related to munitions storage area AE.
   12.42.3. Munitions storage area related facilities must be separated from any PES they are
   not related to by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance (e.g., the munitions storage area
   office from a combat aircraft parking area). However, explosives operating locations may be
   protected by ILD from combat aircraft.
12.43. Concurrent Servicing Operations. CSO using live munitions will be conducted in sited
CAPA locations. Identify inert CSO locations as ESs when they are located within a clearzone.
12.44. Hot-Pit Refueling Operations. All aircraft undergoing hot-pit refueling are considered
to be in transportation mode and are exempt from QD criteria as a PES. The hot-pit refueling
area and associated aircraft will be evaluated as an ES; apply the greater separation treating the
location as a military use only taxiway or separation required for the POL. (See paragraph
12.81 for QD requirements for the POL facilities associated with the hot-pit refueling area.)
12.45. End-of-Runway and Arm/De-arm Pads and Crew Shelters. All aircraft undergoing
end-of-runway or arm/de-arm operations are considered to be in transportation mode and are
exempt from QD criteria as a PES. End-of-runway and arm/de-arm crew shelters will be sited as
military use only runways per Tables 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3. If these shelters are used as office
areas for arm/de-arm crews, they must be sited at IBD, with no minimum fragment distance,
from munition storage area PESs, and ILD from flight line PESs.
12.46. Aircraft NEWQD. Exclude the following AE when determining the NEWQD of
explosives loaded aircraft: AE installed on aircraft (e.g., egress system components, squibs, and
detonators for jettisoning external stores, enginestarter cartridges, fire extinguisher cartridges,
and destructors in electronic equipment), contained in survival and rescue kits (e.g., flares,
signals, explosives components of emergency equipment), and other such items or materials
necessary for safe flight operations.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     241


12.47. Explosives Aircraft Exempt from Siting as a PES. Aircraft configured with the items
listed below are exempt from QD site planning requirements when evaluated as a PES; they must
still be sited as ESs. This does not include AE carried as cargo. Park in a designated aircraft
parking area meeting airfield criteria and treat the aircraft as explosives-loaded in all other
respects. The following munitions can be uploaded and downloaded at the designated aircraft
parking area provided that the quantity of munitions being loaded or unloaded is limited to a
single aircraft load. Munitions delivery trailers (i.e., UALS, BDU, flare & chaff mods, captive-
carry missiles) are considered in the transportation mode (QD-exempt) provided the trailers do
not remain at the designated aircraft parking area longer than the loading or unloading operation
being conducted.
   12.47.1. HD 1.2.2 gun ammunition, 30 mm or less.
   12.47.2. HD 1.3 installed aircraft defensive flares. Externally loaded munitions such as
   LUU-1/2 flares and 2.75‖ training rockets require QD.
   12.47.3. HD 1.4 munitions (i.e., chaff squibs, captive-carry training missiles, BDU-33s).
   12.47.4. Installed explosives necessary for safe flight operations per paragraph 12.46. See
   glossary and T.O. 11A-1-33 for further information.
12.48. Deleted.
12.49. Other Aircraft Configurations.
   12.49.1. For F-15 and F-16 aircraft in the open with AIM/AGM series missile configurations
   as shown in Figures 12.4 and 12.5, use Table 12.1 to determine the type of QD separation
   required for exposed sites and use Figures 12.4 and 12.5 to determine the actual QD
   separation distances. (Note: These distances are not reduced QD separations; they are only
   provided to simplify determination of required QD separations for standard aircraft
   configurations.) For aircraft in a structure, building debris criteria must be considered in
   accordance with paragraph 12.23.1.1.5 or 12.23.1.1.6. Exception: Aircraft in fabric or
   tubular shelters or light metal structures (e.g. butler building), apply the criteria above for
   aircraft in the open. Other aircraft configurations with mixed missile loads may be requested
   through MAJCOM/SEW.
   12.49.2. Internally loaded aircraft, e.g. F-117 and F/A-22, produce secondary debris;
   therefore, building debris criteria must be considered.
12.50. Reduced MCEs for F-15 and F-16 Aircraft with AIM Series Missiles. Testing and
analysis have demonstrated an allowable reduction in MCE and QD for some F-15 and F-16
configurations. Use of these reductions is only allowed if no single trailer servicing the aircraft
would present an MCE greater than the MCE used to generate the aircraft QD arcs. In most
cases, this means that the trailer cannot be loaded with more than the MCE of missiles. Where
test results permit, such as in the case of a single layer of AIM-120 missiles loaded in alternating
directions on a single trailer, reduced trailer MCEs may be applied. In that specific case, the
trailer MCE is a single AIM-120 missile. For F-15 and F-16 aircraft in the open with AIM series
missile configurations as shown in Figures 12.6 and 12.7, use Table 12.1 to determine the type of
QD separation required for exposed sites and use the following to determine actual QD
separation distances:
   12.50.1. For F-15 aircraft in the open, see Figure 12.6.
 242                                                          AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.50.2. For F-16 aircraft in the open, see Figure 12.7.
   12.50.3. For F-15 and F-16 aircraft in fabric or tubular shelters or light metal structures (e.g.
   butler building), apply the criteria above for aircraft in the open.
   12.50.4. For any other type of structure, building debris criteria must be considered in
   accordance with paragraph 12.23.1.1.5 or 12.23.1.1.6.
12.51. Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) and Associated AE Facilities.
   12.51.1. All HAS, except Korean TAB VEE HAS fronts and Korean Flow-Through HAS
   fronts and rears, are structures capable of stopping primary fragments when doors are
   properly secured. HD 1.1 and HD 1.2.3 parenthetical (xx) fragment distances do not apply
   except out the front of a Korean TAB VEE and out the front or rear of a Korean Flow-
   Through HAS.
   12.51.2. HAS will be separated according to Table 12.23 which provides IMD (or
   equivalent) protection. For First, Second, and Third Generation HAS, and Korean TAB VEE
   Modified (with hardened front closure) HAS, these distances will also provide a high degree
   of protection against delayed propagation of explosion when HAS doors are properly
   secured. However, the exposed shelter may be damaged heavily and aircraft and AE within
   may be rendered unserviceable. For Korean TAB VEE HAS front, and Korean Flow-
   Through HAS front or rear (due to openings) at these distances there may be serious damage
   to aircraft and possible delayed propagation of detonation due to fragments, debris, or fire.
   12.51.3. HAS separated according to Table 12.24 (and with HAS doors properly secured)
   will be provided a higher degree of asset preservation (K30 or equivalent overpressure) than
   those provided in Table 12.23. An explosion in one shelter or ready storage facility may
   destroy it and its contents, but aircraft within adjacent shelters will be undamaged provided
   the doors are closed. These aircraft may not be immediately accessible due to debris.
   12.51.4. Table 12.23 and Table 12.24 criteria are based on First, Second, and Third
   Generation HAS doors remaining closed, except for:
       12.51.4.1. Aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi.
       12.51.4.2. During CSO or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are
       being moved into or out of shelters. If doors are left open for extended periods, apply the
       following criteria:
          12.51.4.2.1. For prevention of simultaneous detonation, apply default IMD to or from
          an open front. A HAS arch or rear wall may be considered as a barricade for
          application of K6. No reduction from K11 is allowed between ―open door‖ HAS
          front-to-front exposures.
          12.51.4.2.2. For aircraft survivability, apply Table 12.22 to or from an open front.
   12.51.5. First Generation and Korean TAB VEE HAS are limited to a maximum NEWQD of
   5,863 lbs [2,659.4 kg]. Second Generation, Third Generation, and Korean Flow-Through
   HAS are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 11,000 lbs [4,989.5 kg]. Note: W/WS3 HASs
   are limited to 10,000 lbs IAW AFI 91-112, Safety Rules for US/NATO Strike Fighters. Flow-
   Through HAS Pairs are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 4,800 lbs [2,177.2 kg] in each
   HAS. HAS Pairs with rear walls or with front and rear walls are limited to a maximum
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 243


  NEWQD of 2,390 lbs [1,084.1 kg] in each HAS. HAS Ready Service ECMs/AGMs are
  limited to a maximum NEWQD of 22,000 lbs [9,979 kg].
  12.51.6. Use separation distances of Table 12.25A for separation of unhardened ES from
  Third Generation HAS, provided the NEWQD limitation of paragraph 12.51.5. Lesser
  distances may be permitted to hardened ES that provide equivalent protection, when
  approved by DDESB.
  12.51.7. Apply Table 12.25A for separation of unhardened ES from Second Generation and
  Korean Flow-Through HAS as follows, provided the NEWQD limitations of paragraph
  12.51.5. are met:
     12.51.7.1. To the front, sides, and rear of Second Generation HAS.
     12.51.7.2. To the sides of a Korean Flow-Through HAS. For the front and rear, apply
     default QD criteria.
  12.51.8. Apply Table 12.25B for separation of unhardened ES from First Generation and
  Korean TAB VEE HAS as follows, provided the NEWQD limitations of paragraph 12.51.5.
  are met:
     12.51.8.1. To the front, sides, and rear of First Generation HAS.
     12.51.8.2. To the sides and rear of a Korean TAB VEE HAS. For the front, apply
     default QD criteria.
  12.51.9. Apply Tables 12.25A or 12.25B for separation of unhardened ES from HAS Pairs,
  as appropriate, for the HAS Pair design involved.
  12.51.10. First Generation, Second Generation, Third Generation and Korean TAB VEE
  HAS sited for HD 1.2, HD 1.3, or HD 1.4 explosives, as shown below, do not generate a QD
  clear zone out the sides or rear. Korean Flow-Through HAS sited for HD 1.2, HD 1.3, or HD
  1.4 explosives, as shown below, do not generate a QD clear zone out the sides. For HAS
  pairs, apply the requirements for the HAS Pair design involved. Default QD criteria apply
  out the front of all HAS, and out the front and rear of Korean Flow-Through HAS.
     12.51.10.1. HD 1.2.1, with an MCE less than 110 lbs [50 kg], and an NEWQD subject to
     the limitations in paragraph 12.51.5.
     12.51.10.2. Mission essential quantities of HD 1.2.2.
     12.51.10.3. HD 1.2.3, with a largest single round NEWQD less than 110 lbs [50 kg] and
     an NEWQD subject to the limitations in paragraph 12.51.5.
     12.51.10.4. Mission essential quantities of HD 1.3.
     12.51.10.5. Mission essential quantities of HD 1.4.
  12.51.11. A HAS used solely as a maintenance facility would normally be classified as a
  related facility and would require ILD separation from a supported PES (except as permitted
  for a licensed facility or parking of explosives-loaded aircraft exempt from siting as a PES).
  As an ES, a First, Second, or Third Generation Maintenance HAS will provide K30
  equivalent protection at the reduced distances shown in Table 12.24 with doors properly
  secured. If Table 12.24 is not applied for aircraft survivability, then at a minimum, ILD
  equivalent protection (3.5 psi) will be provided to personnel within the maintenance HAS.
 244                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.51.12. The front, side, or rear sectors of a HAS, as either a PES or an ES, are illustrated
   in Figure 12.3.
   12.51.13. Locate occupied, unhardened facilities no closer to a HAS than those distances
   given in tables 12.25A or 12.25B.
12.52. Weapons Storage Vaults in Hardened Aircraft Shelters. The special weapon contents
of a weapons storage vault (WSV) will not contribute to an explosion in a HAS if certain
separations are maintained. The explosives in the WSV need not be considered when computing
the NEWQD of the HAS if the presence and location of conventional munitions in the HAS
correctly conform to what is allowed by the applicable weapons system safety rules (WSSRs),
AFI 91-112. Table 12.23 provides minimum separation distances for HASs containing WSVs
from all other HASs, with or without WSVs.
12.53. Revetments.
   12.53.1. A connected series of such revetments meeting the requirements of Section 6F may
   be sited for the explosives weight of one revetment.
   12.53.2. Site flight line revetment sets for combat aircraft parking and loading as a combat
   aircraft parking area according to Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3. These revetment sets may be
   used for both aircraft parking and munitions holding. Aircraft in revetments will only be
   afforded equivalent IMD separation. Per Table 12.1, Note 14, two aircraft may be placed in
   a revetted cell at less than IMD without obtaining commander approval; the NEWQD of the
   two aircraft must be totaled for determining QD separations to other exposures.
   12.53.3. Site flight line revetment sets used for munitions as flight line munitions holding
   areas according to Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
   12.53.4. Site revetment sets used solely for the storage of munitions as AGMs according to
   Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
12.54. Aircraft Battle Damage Repair Sites. The maximum NEWQD charge permitted is 2
ounces of HD 1.1. When using sandbags to cover charges and prevent fragment escape, a 300 ft
clear zone is required. For un-sandbagged charges, a 500 ft clear zone is necessary.
12.55. Helicopter Landing Areas for AE Operations. Helicopter landing areas for loading
and unloading AE within storage sites and quick reaction alert sites will be considered AGM and
may be sited at IMD based only upon the NEWQD carried by the helicopter. Such helicopter
landing areas will meet the following requirements:
   12.55.1. Flight clearance criteria are met.
   12.55.2. Landing and takeoff approaches will not be over any AE facilities.
   12.55.3. Helicopter operations are to be limited to AE support of the facilities concerned.
   12.55.4. Carrying of passengers is not permitted.
   12.55.5. During helicopter takeoff, landing, or loading or unloading, AE operations will not
   be conducted at any PES located within IBD of the helicopter landing area. During landing
   or takeoff, PES doors will be closed.
   12.55.6. Safety precautions normal to other modes of transportation are to be observed.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   245


12.56. Defensive or Tactical Missile Batteries. The following criteria apply to deployed
defensive or tactical missile batteries (e.g., Patriot missiles) and associated support functions.
   12.56.1. No separation is required between missile batteries and the security force structures
   exclusively supporting them.
   12.56.2. Those manned functions solely providing support to defensive missile units, such as
   motor pools, may be sited at ILD from the missile battery and other PESs in the explosives
   clear zone in which they are deployed. Barricaded ILD may be applied per paragraph
   12.18.2.1.
   12.56.3. Site missile batteries as AGMs to other PESs in the explosives clear zone in which
   they are deployed. They may be treated as Flight line Munitions Holding Areas to aircraft in
   the explosives clear zone in which they are deployed. No separation is required to military
   use only runways and taxiways.
   12.56.4. Missile batteries deployed within the IBD of AE storage areas may be sited at ILD
   to manned functions considered related to area AE operations. Likewise, missile batteries
   deployed in the clear zones of flight line operations may be sited at ILD to manned flight line
   facilities.
12.57. Tactical Missile Separations.
   12.57.1. AIM-7 Missiles (Other than WAU-17 Warhead).
       12.57.1.1. When these conditions are met MCE is limited to a single AIM-7 warhead
       with an HD of (02)1.1.
           12.57.1.1.1. Separate warheads of adjacent AIM-7 missiles by 5 inches or more.
           12.57.1.1.2. Separate AIM-7 warheads from all AIM-9 warheads by at least 22
           inches, or ensure warheads are not radially aligned.
       12.57.1.2. See Table 12.5 for HFD for missiles at less than 5 inches from each other, if
       they are in the open or in a light structure which cannot stop primary fragments (see
       legend to Table 12.2).
       12.57.1.3. Containers. All missiles in an all up round container (AURC) will
       sympathetically detonate, therefore the MCE is all four warheads in the AURC. AIM-7
       missiles that explode in an AURC will not propagate to warheads in adjacent containers,
       either vertically or horizontally. MCE is limited to four warheads.
       12.57.1.4. In an ECM, the following configurations allow a reduced MCE:
           12.57.1.4.1. Packed in AURC, the MCE is four warheads.
           12.57.1.4.2. For trailers, with or without other AIM-7 (not WAU-17) or AIM-9
           missiles, the MCE is the total quantity of all warheads radially aligned and at less
           than 100 inches from each other.
   12.57.2. AIM-7 Missiles (WAU-17 Warhead).
       12.57.2.1. These warheads can sympathetically detonate other HD 1.1 explosives in
       radial alignment of the warhead. Use radial aligned separation distance of 100 inches or
       more to prevent propagation of one warhead to another.
246                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      12.57.2.2. See Table 12.5 for HFD for missiles in radial alignment and at less than 100
      inches from each other, if they are in the open or in a light structure which cannot stop
      primary fragments (see legend to Table 12.2).
      12.57.2.3. Containers. All missiles in an AURC will sympathetically detonate, therefore
      the MCE is all four warheads in the AURC (36 lbs x 4 or 144 lbs). Detonation of
      warheads in an AURC will not transfer to adjacent containers side-by-side, but containers
      within a single vertical stack must be alternated, nose-to-tail, to prevent propagation
      vertically. MCE would then be four warheads.
      12.57.2.4. In an ECM, the following configurations allow a reduced MCE:
         12.57.2.4.1. For alternately stack containers (per paragraph 12.57.2.3) and trailers not
         in radial alignment, the MCE is four warheads.
         12.57.2.4.2. For alternately stack containers (per paragraph 12.57.2.3) and no more
         than three trailers in radial alignment, the MCE is twelve warheads.
      12.57.2.5. For ECM storage other than that described in paragraph 12.57.2.4, and storage
      in all other heavy structures capable of stopping primary fragments (see legend to Table
      12.2), MCE is the total number of warheads in the structure unless a lesser MCE is
      approved by AFSC/SEW.
  12.57.3. AIM-9 Missiles.
      12.57.3.1. A warhead detonation will not cause sympathetic detonation of adjacent AIM-
      9 missiles provided warheads are separated by 22 inches or more, or warheads are not
      radially aligned. If these conditions are met, MCE is limited to a single AIM-9 warhead.
      12.57.3.2. See Table 12.5 for HFD in the open.
      12.57.3.3. AIM-9 missiles that detonate in AURC containers will not propagate to any
      adjacent container either vertically or horizontally. MCE is limited to four warheads.
  12.57.4. AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).
      12.57.4.1. Out of container, these missiles are HD 1.1. In an AURC, they are HD 1.2.1.
      12.57.4.2. MCE is limited to a single AIM-120 missile when the warheads of adjacent
      AIM-120 missiles are separated by 100 inches or more. See Table 12.5 for single missile
      HFD.
      12.57.4.3. See Table 12.5 for HFD for missiles in radial alignment and at less than 100
      inches from each other.
      12.57.4.4. Containers. All missiles in an AURC will sympathetically detonate, therefore
      the MCE is all four warheads in the AURC. For AIM-120s with the WDU-33/B
      warhead, the AURC MCE is 68 lbs. For AIM-120s with the WDU-41B warhead, the
      AURC MCE is 76 lbs.
  12.57.5. Single container MCEs may be used for mixed storage configurations of AIM-7,
  AIM-9 and AIM-120 missile containers provided the following conditions are met:
      12.57.5.1. Each stack of containers will contain the same type of missile and warhead.
      12.57.5.2. Each stack will be no more than three containers high.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    247


     12.57.5.3. For containers of AIM-7 missiles with the WAU-l0 warhead: (1) the missiles
     must be oriented in the same direction within the container, (2) there is no restriction on
     the orientation of the containers relative to one another within a stack, (3) there is no
     restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required
     separation between stacks. MCE of the stack(s) is 105 pounds (lbs) of HD 1.1 (based on
     the four warheads a single container).
     12.57.5.4. For containers of AIM-7 missiles with the WAU-17 warhead: (1) the missiles
     must be oriented in the same direction within the container, (2) the containers within a
     single stack must be alternated (nose-to-tail), (3) there is no restriction on the orientation
     of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required separation between stacks.
     MCE of the stack(s) is 144lbs of HD 1.1 (based on the four warheads in a single
     container).
     12.57.5.5. For containers of AIM-9 missiles with the WDU-l7 warhead: (1) there is no
     restriction on the orientation of the missiles relative to one another within a container, (2)
     there is no restriction on the orientation of the containers relative to one another within a
     stack, (3) there is no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4)
     there is no required separation between stacks. MCE of the stack(s) is 32 lbs of HD 1.1
     (based on the four warheads in a single container).
     12.57.5.6. For containers of AIM-120 missiles with the WDU-33/B warhead: (1) the
     missiles must be oriented in the same direction within the container, (2) there is no
     restriction on the orientation of the containers relative to one another within a stack, (3)
     there is no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no
     required separation distance between stacks. The stack(s) is HD 1.2.1 with an MCE of 68
     lbs (based on the four missiles in a single container)
     12.57.5.7. For containers of AIM-120 missiles with the WDU-41/B warhead: (1) the
     missiles must be oriented in the same direction within the container, (2) there is no
     restriction on the orientation of the containers relative to one another within a stack, (3)
     there is no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no
     required separation distance between stacks. The stack(s) is HD 1.2.1 with an MCE of 76
     lbs (based on the four missiles in a single container).
     12.57.5.8. Stacks of differing missile and warhead configurations will be separated from
     each other by a horizontal distance of 100 inches. (For example, stacks of AIM-7/WAU-
     10 containers will be separated by a horizontal distance of 100 inches from stacks of
     AIM-7/WAU-17 containers.)
     12.57.5.9. When the above conditions are met, the storage of mixed AIM-7, AIM-9 and
     AIM-120 missile containers (with the specified warheads) may be sited using the most
     restrictive of the following:
        12.57.5.9.1. Site the greatest MCE present as HD 1.1 (regardless of whether the
        greatest MCE is for HD 1.1 or HD 1.2.1).
        12.57.5.9.2. Site the total HD 1.2.1 Net Explosive Weight for Quantity-Distance
        (NEWQD) present.
 248                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   12.57.6. AGM-65 Missiles. Explosives weights of individual AGM-65 missiles or loaded
   launchers need not be added together if adjacent missiles or launchers are separated by at
   least 130 inches and the nose of any AGM-65 missile does not point at any other missile.
   12.57.7. AGM-88 Hi-Speed Anti-radiation Missile (HARM). For storage and transportation
   in an AURC, missiles are assigned HD 1.2.1, with an MCE <100 lbs. Out of container,
   missiles are assigned HD (04)1.1. A warhead detonation will not cause sympathetic
   detonation of adjacent warheads if they are separated by at least 6 inches, or if the warheads
   are not radially aligned.
   12.57.8. Mixed Trailer Loads. Use criteria above and configurations as shown in T.O. 11-1-
   38, Positioning and Tie-Down Procedures – Nonnuclear Munitions, to determine MCE.
12.58. Inspection Stations for AE Conveyances.
   12.58.1. Inspection stations for trucks, trailers and railcars containing AE that are used
   exclusively for the activities below are not subject to QD criteria. However, these stations
   should be located as far as practical from other hazards (e.g., explosives, POL), populated
   areas, and flight lines, and the AE conveyance should be removed promptly. Allowable
   activities are:
       12.58.1.1. External visual inspection of the railcars or trucks containing AE.
       12.58.1.2. Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo packaging in vehicles
       that have passed the external inspection indicated in paragraph 12.58.1.1.
       12.58.1.3. Interchange of trucks, trailers, or railcars containing AE between the common
       carrier and the DoD activity.
   12.58.2. Inspection stations used for any other purpose (e.g., explosives storage, suspect
   vehicle holding area) will comply with applicable QD criteria.
12.59. Interchange Yards for AE Conveyances.
   12.59.1. Interchange yards for trucks, trailers, and railcars containing AE that are used
   exclusively for the activities below are not subject to QD criteria. However, these
   interchange yards should be located as far as practical from other hazards (e.g., explosives,
   POL), populated areas, and flight lines, and the AE conveyance shall be removed promptly.
   Allowable activities are:
       12.59.1.1. External inspection of the trucks, trailers, or railcars containing AE.
       12.59.1.2. Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo packaging in vehicles
       that passed the external inspection indicated in paragraph 12.59.1.1.
       12.59.1.3. Interchange of trucks, trailers or railcars containing AE between the common
       carrier and the DoD activity.
   12.59.2. Truck, trailer, or railcar interchange used for any other purpose (e.g., explosives
   storage, suspect vehicle holding area) will comply with applicable QD criteria.
12.60. Holding Yards for AE Conveyances.
   12.60.1. Site vehicle and rail holding yards as AGM per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   249


       12.60.1.1. Where possible, explosives-loaded vehicles and railcars shall be separated
       from each other by the applicable IMD. Distances to other exposures will then be based
       on the vehicle and railcar with the largest NEWQD.
       12.60.1.2. If IMD between vehicles and railcars cannot be met, they shall be parked in
       groups, with IMD between each group. Distances to other exposures will then be based
       on the total amount of explosives within the group of vehicles or railcars with the largest
       NEWQD.
       12.60.1.3. Where neither paragraph 12.60.1.1 nor 12.60.1.2 above is possible, the total
       NEWQD of all vehicles or railcars will be used to determine separation distances.
   12.60.2. In addition to the temporary parking of railcars, trucks, or trailers containing AE,
   holding yards may be used to interchange truck, trailers or railcars between the commercial
   carrier and the DoD activity, and to conduct visual inspections, but can not be used
   simultaneously for these activities.
   12.60.3. In developing large rail holding yards, consider the following layout guidance:
       12.60.3.1. Design rail holding yards on a unit car or explosives weight group basis (e.g.,
       50,000, 100,000, or 250,000 net pounds of HD 1.1 explosives, regardless of the number
       of cars involved). Separate each explosives quantity car group from all other groups by
       IMD.
       12.60.3.2. Yards may be formed by two parallel ladder tracks connected by diagonal
       spurs or by a ―Christmas tree‖ arrangement (a ladder track with diagonal dead-end spurs
       projecting from each side at alternate intervals). Other arrangements tailored to the
       operation are allowed. However, separate parallel tracks and spurs of all types by IMD
       for the quantities of AE involved.
12.61. Classification Yards.
   12.61.1. Where the volume of vehicle or rail traffic necessitates, establish a classification
   yard primarily for receiving, classifying, switching, and dispatching explosives-laden
   vehicles and railcars.
   12.61.2. As an ES, site classification yards at IMD from all PESs.
   12.61.3. Classification yards do not require siting as a PES provided they are used
   exclusively for:
       12.61.3.1. Receiving, dispatching, classifying, and switching of cars.
       12.61.3.2. Interchanging of trucks, trailers, or railcars between the common carrier and
       the DoD activity.
       12.61.3.3. Conducting external inspection of vehicles or railcars, or opening of free
       rolling doors of railcars for the purpose of removing documents and making a visual
       inspection of the cargo. Freeing or repairing a stuck or damaged door or doing any work
       inside a car is prohibited unless QD requirements can be met.
   12.61.4. Specific QD separation applies if the classification yard is used for any other
   purpose (e.g., placing or removing dunnage or explosive items into or from vehicles or
   railcars).
 250                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


12.62. AE Transportation Mode Change Locations.
   12.62.1. Site transportation mode change locations as operating locations per Tables 12.1,
   12.2 and 12.3.
12.63. Suspect Vehicle Holding Areas. Explosives-loaded vehicles or railcars found or
suspected to be in a hazardous condition will be moved to a suspect vehicle holding area, unless
it is more hazardous to move the vehicle or railcar. Suspect vehicle holding areas will be
separated (isolated) from other PES or ES by the applicable QD treating the holding area as an
AGM.
12.64. Secure Holding Areas.
   12.64.1. Secure holding areas are designated for the temporary parking of commercial
   carriers' motor vehicles transporting DoD-owned Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives
   (AAE), classified (SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL) materials, and Controlled Cryptographic
   Items (CCI). There are two types of secure holding areas and the criteria for each are
   provided below. (Note: The intent of such areas is to provide a secure storage location for
   commercial carriers while in-transit, during emergencies or other circumstances that are
   beyond a carrier’s control. Installations must site secure holding areas to meet known
   taskings. The term Secure Holding Area is applicable to areas (CONUS, Hawaii, Alaska,
   and Puerto Rico) governed by Military Standard (MIL-STD)-882D, Standard Practice for
   System Safety, and DTR 4500.9-R.
       12.64.1.1. Secure Explosives Holding Area. Site as a holding yard per paragraph
       12.60.
       12.64.1.2. Secure Non-explosives Holding Area. No siting required if located outside
       all QD arcs. If located within a QD arc, site at PTRD from all PESs. The holding of HD
       1.4S materials, without regard to QD, is permitted at this location.
   12.64.2. See paragraph 1.5 when there is no Secure Holding Area sited for the NEWQD or
   HD of the vehicle for unforeseen taskings.
12.65. Detached Loading Docks.
   12.65.1. Detached loading docks that service multiple facilities shall be sited on the basis of
   use with regard to the facilities serviced, as shown below. They shall be sited as AGM with
   regard to all other facilities.
   12.65.2. When servicing magazines, such docks must be separated from the magazines by
   IMD, based only on the explosives limit of the loading dock.
   12.65.3. When servicing operating buildings, such docks must be separated from the
   operating building by ILD, based only on the explosives limit of the loading dock.
   12.65.4. Loading docks that support a single PES do not require QD separation from the
   supported PES.
12.66. Service Magazines for Operating Locations.
   12.66.1. Apply ILD from a service magazine to the operating location it supports. No QD
   separation is required from the supported operating location back to the service magazine.
   (See paragraph 12.12.2.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   251


   12.66.2. Site the service magazine as an AGM per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3 to all PESs
   that it does not support.
   12.66.3. Railcars and vehicles should not be used as service magazines for explosives
   operating locations, unless such use is essential.
12.67. Non-Explosives Loaded Vehicle Parking Areas.
   12.67.1. Reference DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms,
   Ammunition, and Explosives, for parking POVs in a munitions storage area.
   12.67.2. Site parking areas not supporting the explosives mission (such as parking lots for
   administrative areas) as PTR exposures per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3. A minimum 100 foot
   separation distance is required unless a greater minimum distance is specified in Tables 12.1,
   12.2, or 12.3. (Note: Motor pools normally require IBD because of office, workshops, and
   other inhabited buildings.)
   12.67.3. Site POV parking areas supporting multiple PESs as related facilities per Tables
   12.1, 12.2 and 12.3 from the PESs they support. A minimum 100 foot separation distance is
   required. GOV and AGE parking areas supporting multiple PESs will be sited at 100 ft from
   supported PESs. For GOV and AGE parking areas supporting multiple PESs, the 100 ft
   minimum may be reduced to 50 ft if applicable PESs within 100 ft of the parking areas, are
   of non-combustible construction and have a barrier, sufficient to prevent the vehicle from
   rolling within 50 ft of the PES, located between the parking spaces and the PES. Access for
   emergency vehicles must be provided. (Note: The provisions of this subparagraph do not
   negate the need to comply with any applicable security requirements for POV access to or
   parking in explosives areas. See DoD 5100.76-M.)
   12.67.4. When a POV, GOV or AGE parking area supports a single PES, it may be located
   at 100 ft minimum from the PES it supports to protect the PES from vehicle fires. This
   minimum distance of 100 ft may be reduced to 50 ft if the PES is of non-combustible
   construction and a barrier sufficient to prevent the vehicle from rolling within 50 ft of the
   PES is located between parking spaces and the PES. Access for emergency vehicles must be
   provided. (Note: The provisions of this subparagraph do not negate the need to comply with
   any applicable security requirements for POV access to or parking in explosives areas. See
   DoD 5100.76-M.)
   12.67.5. Temporary parking of GOVs or AGE, other than those being loaded or unloaded,
   will not be closer than 25 ft to any PES. Temporary means the length of time for which the
   presence of the vehicle is essential to completion of a single task (e.g., a single work order
   number).
   12.67.6. Parking areas used exclusively for non-munitions WRM vehicles will be sited at
   ILD from all PESs. A minimum 100 foot separation distance is required. PTRD or IBD
   should be used, when possible, to prevent unacceptable damage to critical war support
   vehicles and equipment.
12.68. Inert Storage.
   12.68.1. Unoccupied inert storage facilities that are directly related to the explosives
   mission, and unoccupied inert storage facilities not directly related but where control of and
   access to such inert storage is restricted only to personnel directly related to the explosives
 252                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   mission, may be located at fire protection distance from all related PESs (100 ft if the PES
   structure is combustible; 50 ft if the PES structure is non-combustible). Locations for such
   inert storage facilities will be determined only after consideration of personnel exposure, the
   importance of the materiel in relation to the explosives mission, the operational conditions,
   and the availability of space.
   12.68.2. Unoccupied inert storage not directly related to the explosives mission and when
   accessed by personnel not directly related to the explosives mission, will be sited as a PTR
   exposure per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3, when located in the open (no structure involved).
   The PTRD will be based on blast overpressure only; fragment distances will not be used.
   Locate such inert storage within an explosives clear zone only after consideration of
   personnel exposure, the importance of the materiel in relation to the mission, the operational
   conditions, and the availability of space. Minimum fire protection distances given in
   paragraph 12.68.1. apply.
   12.68.3. Unoccupied inert storage not directly related to the explosives mission and when
   accessed by personnel not directly related to the explosives mission, will be sited as an
   inhabited building per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3, when located in a structure. The IBD will
   be based on blast overpressure only; fragment distances will not be used. Minimum fire
   protection distances given in paragraph 12.68.1. apply.
   12.68.4. Site occupied inert storage facilities (e.g., warehouses) supporting the explosives
   mission as related facilities per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3 from the PESs they support.
   12.68.5. Site occupied inert storage facilities (e.g. warehouses) not supporting the explosives
   mission as inhabited buildings per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
   12.68.6. Site related non-munitions WRM storage at ILD from all PESs. PTRD or IBD
   should be used, when possible, to prevent unacceptable damage to critical war support assets.
   See paragraph 12.68.2 and 12.68.3. for non-related unoccupied non-munitions WRM storage.
12.69. Protective Shielding and Remotely Controlled Operations. For operations requiring
protective shielding or remote control per paragraph 4.17., see paragraph 7.30. for operating
requirements and apply the following QD separations:
   12.69.1. As an ES, treat as an operating location per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
   12.69.2. As a PES:
       12.69.2.1. Provide equivalent PTRD protection for blast and thermal hazards, and
       equivalent IBD protection for fragment hazards, to related personnel.
       12.69.2.2. Provide IBD to all other non-related occupied ESs.
       12.69.2.3. Treat as an operating location per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3, for protection of
       unoccupied ESs; use of Table 12.1, Note 21 is not allowed.
12.70. Deleted.
12.71. Buffered Storage.
   12.71.1. Buffered Storage Concept. Under certain conditions, propagation can be
   prevented between stacks of tritonal-filled MK-82 and MK-84 bombs. NEWQD for QD
   purposes is the explosives weight of the largest stack plus explosives weight of intervening
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 253


   buffer material (excluding HD 1.4). Buffered storage can be used in earth covered
   magazines, aboveground magazines, or open stacks. The following limitations apply:
      12.71.1.1. Stacks are limited to 64 MK84 or 312 MK82 bombs. Combined stacks are
      limited to 60,500 lbs NEWQD.
      12.71.1.2. Acceptable buffer materials are: palletized 20mm ammunition, palletized
      30mm ammunition, or CBU-58s packaged two per metal container, stacked one pallet
      wide (one container CBU-58) and as high as the stack being protected.
      12.71.1.3. Buffer materials must be positioned between the two stacks of bombs to
      prevent line-of-sight exposure between stacks.
      12.71.1.4. Steel nose and tail plugs must be used in all bombs. Bombs are arranged so
      the noses of the bombs in each stack are facing the buffer.
      12.71.1.5. A minimum of 38 ft is maintained between the nearest bombs of the separate
      stacks. For bomb stacks of 24,000 lbs NEWQD or less, 20 ft is acceptable. The stacks
      will be arranged within a structure so access is possible to verify the configuration.
      12.71.1.6. Only serviceable munitions may be used in the bomb stacks or the buffer
      stacks.
      12.71.1.7. Buffer material may be removed for periodic inspections without effecting
      sited capacities if it is returned within 24 hours.
      12.71.1.8. Buffered storage is approved for storage in locations where US explosives
      safety standards are the only criteria applied. In locations where the host nation has
      established safety criteria, these principles must be accepted by the host nation before
      they may be applied.
   12.71.2. Units wanting to use different configurations or buffer materials must submit
   definitive drawings through the MAJCOM to AFSC/SEW for approval. These new buffers
   will consist of HD 1.2, 1.4, or inert materials that have an aerial density of 500 pounds per
   square foot. For bomb stacks less than 24,000 lbs NEWQD, an aerial density of 250 pounds
   per square foot is acceptable.
12.72. Angled Storage.
   12.72.1. Angled Storage Concept. Tests have shown that fragments from an exploding
   MK-82/84 bomb that are capable of initiating a nearby bomb are limited to a zone extending
   perpendicular to the bomb. Therefore positioning of bombs outside the fragment zone of
   other bombs may significantly reduce the MCE.
   12.72.2. Angled Storage in HASs.
      12.72.2.1. Place single bombs and loaded triple ejector racks (TER), or bomb rack units
      (BRU) at a 15 degree angle along one shelter wall. Angle bomb and rack away from the
      aircraft and point tails toward the wall.
      12.72.2.2. Maintain 4-ft separation distance from MK-84s to other weapons and 30-inch
      separation from MK-82s to other weapons.
      12.72.2.3. Do not align unfuzed cavities of bombs.
 254                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       12.72.2.4. Install fuzes, boosters, steel nose and tail plugs or guidance packages.
       12.72.2.5. Do not place bombs in an area on either side of another bomb bounded by two
       lines, 20 degrees forward and aft of lines perpendicular to the bomb centerline and
       starting at the nose and the tail of the bomb, respectively (see Figure 12.8).
       12.72.2.6. If above criteria is complied with, the MCE is the cumulative NEWQD of one
       TER or BRU, or for single angled bombs, it is the NEWQD of one bomb. When an
       explosives loaded aircraft is in the HAS, the weight of the explosives on the aircraft and
       the stored weapons must be combined if either the weapons on the aircraft or the stored
       weapons are in the fragment zone, described above, of the other weapons.
   12.72.3. Deleted.
12.73. Areas for Burning AE.
   12.73.1. Check environmental compliance and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA) requirements and permits for this operation. For overseas locations, check Status of
   Forces Agreement and applicable technical agreements for any applicable environmental
   protection requirements.
   12.73.2. Burning HD 1.3 materials can generate significant internal pressures. Some HD 1.3
   materials can undergo a transition from a deflagration to a detonation, in which case the
   effects are virtually identical to the detonation of conventional high explosives (HD 1.1). For
   information on an item, contact the item manager.
   12.73.3. Use QD formulas described in paragraph 12.11. and site burning areas as follows:
       12.73.3.1. Use K40 from burning areas to all locations involving personnel that are not
       essential to the planned burn or to non-explosives facilities not related to the burn. If the
       NEWQD of the burn material is more than 450 lbs, the minimum safe separation distance
       shall be at least 1,250 ft. Use table 12.4. for determining the HFD for NEWQDs less than
       or equal to 450 lbs.
       12.73.3.2. Apply K40 with no minimum fragment distance from burning areas to
       locations with exposed aircraft.
       12.73.3.3. Use K24 with no minimum fragment distance from burning areas to all
       locations involving personnel that are essential to the planned burn, explosives operating
       locations not related to the burn, explosives storage facilities, related non-explosives
       facilities, or above ground utilities.
       12.73.3.4. Locate burning areas at ILD from other PESs.
       12.73.3.5. Locate control sites for burning areas at PTRD from all other PESs.
   12.73.4. Locate burning kettles at least 300 ft from inhabited buildings, public transport
   routes, and the base boundary. Separate from other explosives facilities by 300 ft or ILD,
   whichever is greater.
   12.73.5. Lesser distances may be used if equivalent protection can be provided. Forward
   design and analysis information for equivalent protection to AFSC/SEW for approval.
12.74. Areas Used for Intentional Detonations. This paragraph does not apply to EOD
training sites (see paragraph 12.76), off range locations (see paragraph 12.77.3.), emergency
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     255


operations (see paragraph 4.20), or range clearance operations where the expected
blast/fragmentation effects will not exceed existing range surface danger zones as defined in AFI
13-212, Range Planning and Operations.
   12.74.1. Check environmental compliance and RCRA requirements and permits for this
   operation. For overseas locations, check Status of Forces Agreement and applicable
   technical agreements for any applicable environmental protection requirements.
   12.74.2. Shaped charge jets or slugs from directed energy munitions can travel significantly
   greater distances than case fragments; therefore, these munitions require specific analysis.
   For information on an item, contact the item manager.
   12.74.3. Use the following criteria from the detonation area to all locations involving
   personnel that are not essential to the planned detonation, non-explosives facilities not related
   to the detonation, locations with exposed aircraft and open explosives storage locations. If
   the minimum separation distance requirements for previously approved DDESB sitings or
   those prescribed in this section cannot be met, personnel shall be provided the protection
   specified in paragraph 4.18. (Note: The calculation of NEWQD for EOD intentional
   detonations differs from that used for transportation and storage. For intentional detonations,
   NEWQD can never be less than NEW; and, TNT equivalency must be factored-in for
   specific high explosives being used. The NEWQD and TNT equivalent determination for
   EOD intentional detonation is addressed in AFTO 60A-1-1-4, Protection of Personnel and
   Property.)
       12.74.3.1. For non-fragmenting AE, use K328 with a minimum distance of 200 ft.
       12.74.3.2. For fragmenting AE, use the larger of the two distances given in
       subparagraphs 12.74.3.2.1. and 12.74.3.2.2:
           12.74.3.2.1. K328 with a minimum distance of 200 feet.
           12.74.3.2.2. The distances given in Table 12.26A or Table 12.26B. A calculated
           (using DDESB Technical Paper 16) or measured maximum fragment throw distance
           (including the interaction effects for stacks of items or single items, whichever
           applies) may also be used to replace these distances. Calculated case fragment
           maximum throw distances for selected munitions are listed in the Fragmentation
           Data Review Form located on the DDESB secure web page. This database is
           included in TP 16. (NOTE: Tables 12.26A and 12.26B, as well as the Fragmentation
           Data Review Form in TP 16, are for individual items. These distances do not directly
           apply to stacks of munitions. Further, these throw distances do not consider
           fragments that are produced by sections of nose plugs, base plates, boattails, or
           lugs. These fragments are sometimes referred to as ―rogue‖ fragments. In addition,
           shaped charge jets or slugs from directed energy munitions can travel significantly
           greater distances than case fragments; therefore, these munitions require specific
           analysis.)
              12.74.3.2.2.1. ―Rogue‖ fragments produced by sections of nose plugs, base
              plates, or lugs, can travel significantly greater distances (more than 10,000 ft) than
              those shown in Tables 12.26A and 12.26B. Care must be taken either to properly
              orient the munition (e.g., lugs or strongbacks and nose or tail plate sections
              oriented away from personnel locations), or to minimize or eliminate the hazard
256                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


             of rogue fragments (e.g., sand bagging the munition prior to detonation). For such
             bombs and projectiles with a caliber exceeding 5 inches, the munition will be
             buried or covered according to the Buried Explosion Module procedures outlined
             in DDESB TP 16.
             12.74.3.2.2.2. For detonation of multiple munitions, comply with the following
             unless an approved technical order alternative is authorized:
                 12.74.3.2.2.2.1. Place the munitions in a single layer with their sides touching
                 such that their axis is horizontal.
                 12.74.3.2.2.2.2. Place the munitions so that the nose of each munition is
                 pointing in the same direction.
                 12.74.3.2.2.2.3. Orient the munitions so that lugs or strongbacks and nose or
                 tail plate sections are facing away from areas to be protected.
                 12.74.3.2.2.2.4. Initiate the stack detonation so that all munitions detonate
                 simultaneously.
                 12.74.3.2.2.2.5. Use the following when the procedures outlined in
                 paragraphs 12.74.3.2.2.2.1 through 12.74.3.2.2.2.4 cannot be met:
                   12.74.3.2.2.2.5.1. If the orientation of the potential rogue fragments can be
                   controlled, then the separation distance required by the Fragmentation Data
                   Review Form in TP 16 shall be increased by 33 percent to account for the
                   interaction effects and/or non-design mode initiation.
                   12.74.3.2.2.2.5.2. If the orientation of potential rogue fragments cannot be
                   controlled, fragment ranges must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
                   12.74.3.2.2.2.5.3. If detonations involve stacks of mixed munitions,
                   evaluate the distance for each munition separately using the procedures in
                   paragraph 12.74.3.2.2 and select the largest distance.
  12.74.4. Use the following criteria from the detonation area to all locations involving
  personnel that are essential to the planned detonation, explosives storage facilities, and above
  ground utilities:
      12.74.4.1. For non-fragmenting AE, use K105 with a minimum distance of 200
      ft. Exception: Personnel protection for essential personnel involved in EOD operations
      will be in accordance with AFTO 60A-1-1-4, Protection of Personnel and Property.
      12.74.4.2. For fragmenting AE, use K105 with a minimum distance of 200 ft. Provide a
      personnel shelter that offers adequate overhead and frontal protection capable of
      defeating all potential fragments. Exception: Personnel protection for essential personnel
      involved in EOD operations will be in accordance with AFTO 60A-1-1-4.
      12.74.4.3. If the minimum personnel protection distance in paragraph 12.74.4.1 or
      12.74.4.2 is not available, construct a personnel shelter that will provide equivalent
      protection from the expected blast overpressure and fragment hazards for the types of
      munitions used. Locate it at least 200 ft from the detonation area. Obtain shelter design
      approval per paragraph 12.74.8.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                      257


   12.74.5. On-site authorities designate essential personnel and determine minimum distance
   for equipment and unoccupied non-explosives facilities related to the detonation.
   12.74.6. From the detonation area to underground utilities, use K18 with a minimum
   distance of 100 ft.
   12.74.7. Control sites for intentional detonations for AE disposals, live-fire demonstrations
   and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) non-emergency operations must be at ILD from
   other PES, based on the PES’s NEWQD.
   12.74.8. Lesser distances may be used if equivalent protection can be provided. Forward
   design and analysis information for equivalent protection to AFSC/SEW for approval.
12.75. EOD Operational Responses. EOD operational responses require the application of
public withdrawal distances to all non-essential personnel per paragraph 10.11 and 10.12.
12.76. EOD Proficiency Training Ranges.
   12.76.1. Because the quantity of explosives required to maintain EOD proficiency is small,
   criteria for an EOD proficiency training range are not as stringent as required for a detonation
   area (see paragraph 12.74). Limit EOD training ranges to a maximum of 5 lbs of demolition
   explosives. Use only non-fragmenting charges (e.g., Boot Banger, bare C-4, Conical Liquid
   Follow Through), shaped charges (e.g., Mk 7 series, Mk 2, flex linear), ordnance penetrators
   (e.g., Mk 23, Mk 24), and explosive powered tools (e.g., Mk-2 dearmer, Percussion Actuated
   Non-electric Disruptor). A minimum of three sand bags must be placed in front of explosive
   penetrators to capture explosively formed penetrator and limit directional force.
   12.76.2. EOD proficiency training range destruction points will be constructed to control
   ejection of debris by:
      12.76.2.1. Constructing a barricade with two entrances, which surrounds the destruction
      point, that is the equivalent of at least two side-to-side sandbags, is at least 6 ft high, and
      is constructed within 10 ft of the destruction point.
      12.76.2.2. Locating the barricade entrances at 180 degrees separation. These entrances
      will be barricaded, as above, to effectively block all debris.
   12.76.3. Use the following criteria from the destruction point to all above ground facilities
   (including public traffic routes, base boundaries, runways, taxiways, parking aprons and any
   PES except for associated holding pads as discussed in para 12.76.8 below):
      12.76.3.1. If the destruction point is at least 500 ft from these facilities, a 5 lbs NEWQD
      limit applies.
      12.76.3.2. If the destruction point is less than 500 ft but 300 ft or more from these
      facilities, a 2.5 lb NEWQD limit applies.
      12.76.3.3. If the destruction point is less than 300 ft but 200 ft or more from these
      facilities, a 1.25 lb NEWQD limit applies.
   12.76.4. EOD proficiency training ranges on which explosively-operated tool kits and
   explosively-driven IED Defeat charges are used on inert targets. Targets may be ―monitored‖
   by non-fragmenting explosive charges that are within parameters of the established
   range. The tools, charges, and targets all require 100 ft separation distance from the
 258                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   destruction point to all above ground facilities. The destruction point will be barricaded per
   paragraph 12.76.2.
       12.76.4.1. EOD tools (explosives devices) and inert training devices or targets are non-
       fragmentation producing devices. They may produce some debris, but that should not
       be mistaken for fragmentation. Fragmentation is specifically designed into a weapon or
       device; debris is not.
       12.76.4.2. Vehicle-targets (for remote-opening techniques or otherwise checking for
       IEDs) on EOD proficiency ranges is standard practice. EOD teams are allowed to do
       this type of training on their proficiency ranges.
   12.76.5. On-site authorities determine the minimum separation distance for essential
   personnel.
   12.76.6. EOD proficiency training ranges used with other than bare charges or non-fragment
   producing items will meet the requirements of paragraph 12.74. If using the training range
   for operations that will produce fragments above the level expected for normal EOD
   proficiency training (normally open shots), meet the requirements of paragraph 12.74.
   12.76.7. If the proficiency training range is located on an existing disposal range and meets
   the 500-foot separation distance from the detonation point to the perimeter of the disposal
   range in accordance with the requirements listed in TO 11A-1-42, Section 1, then barricades
   identified in paragraph 12.76.2 are not required.
   12.76.8. Holding pads. Holding pads for additional training shots will be sited using
   aboveground magazine criteria. ILD must be maintained to the destruction point and to the
   personnel control site. IMD must be maintained between each holding pad.
   12.76.9. Locate control sites and detonation points at PTRD from all other PESs.
12.77. EOD Training at Off-Range Locations.
   12.77.1. EOD personnel may use procedures with explosively propelled liquids, shots, gases,
   slugs, or heat at off-range locations on military installations in support of unit training,
   inspections, and evaluations.
   12.77.2. EOD teams may use the following tools:
       12.77.2.1. MK 1 Remote Wrench.
       12.77.2.2. MK 2 .50 Dearmer.
       12.77.2.3. MK 31 Jet Remote Opening Device (JROD).
       12.77.2.4. Improvised Dearmer.
       12.77.2.5. Robotic Vehicle (with shotgun).
       12.77.2.6. Stand-off disrupter.
       12.77.2.7. Stand-off dearmer.
       12.77.2.8. Percussion Actuated Neutralizer (PAN).
       12.77.2.9. Explosively    propelled    water    charges    (commercially       produced or
              improvised).
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 259


   12.77.3. Use only the explosives items listed below for off-range unit training, inspection
   and evaluation operations. Quantities shown are the maximums authorized for each
   inspection or evaluation scenario. EOD 60-Series publications will be used to calculate
   appropriate standoff distances for EOD training and operations at off-range locations.
      12.77.3.1. Two .50 caliber impulse cartridges.
      12.77.3.2. Two .50 caliber ball, M2 cartridges (projectile extracted).
      12.77.3.3. Two electric or non-electric blasting caps.
      12.77.3.4. Twenty feet of standard detonating cord (DODIC M456).
      12.77.3.5. Thirteen feet of safety fuse.
      12.77.3.6. Three M60 fuse lighters.
      12.77.3.7. Three AN-M14 thermite grenades.
      12.77.3.8. Five 12 gauge shotgun shells. (Note: Do not use 00 buckshot at off-range
      locations. When using # 7 1/2 shot, ensure a safe distance for shot travel.)
      12.77.3.9. Five stand-off disrupter blank cartridges.
      12.77.3.10. Shock Tube as required.
      12.77.3.11. Igniters (Shock Tube Initiators, DODIC YY35) as required.
      12.77.3.12. 5 each PAN Cartridges.
   12.77.4. Under the following conditions, EOD personnel may conduct off-range operations
   using the tools and explosives described in paragraphs 12.77.2 and 12.77.3:
      12.77.4.1. Coordinate specific location with the installation weapons safety office, prior
      to the operation.
      12.77.4.2. Make proper notifications concerning anticipated noise.
      12.77.4.3. Do not locate the operation in an explosives prohibited zone.
      12.77.4.4. Evacuate personnel to the applicable withdrawal distances required for an
      actual situation.
      12.77.4.5. Place a minimum of three filled sand bags in front and behind tools that
      project slugs, fluids or shot to limit directional force.
      12.77.4.6. Use only slugs made of plaster, which will disintegrate on impact.
      12.77.4.7. Select an area free of all fire hazards and use only inert training ordnance or
      IED concealment devices (see paragraph 12.76.4) as a target.
      12.77.4.8. When operating tool sets inside a building, take positive measures to prevent
      secondary or collateral damage.
12.78. Static Test Firing Propellant Loaded Items.
   12.78.1. Using the total NEWQD of the propellant, site static test locations using K40 with a
   minimum distance of 300 ft to all PESs and locations where there are non-essential personnel
   and operations. Maintain a minimum of 50 ft from the non-flame exposure area and 300 ft
 260                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   from the flame exposure area to related non-explosive exposed sites, unless an engineering
   analysis shows a lesser distance is adequate. The flame exposure area is 45 degrees on either
   side of the flame exit nozzle or port.
   12.78.2. Test authorities designate essential personnel.       Provide these personnel with
   protection as required in paragraph 4.19.
12.79. Military Working Dog (MWD) Explosives Search Training. Training of MWD
involves searches to detect explosives that have been hidden in various public places. These
training operations typically include handling explosives, cutting or dividing explosive training
aids, removing explosives from shipping and storage containers, and repackaging explosives into
other containers. For these reasons, training operations will:
   12.79.1. Be conducted by qualified personnel.
   12.79.2. Be conducted in facilities that meet the requirements of this Manual.
   12.79.3. Store explosives in facilities that meet the requirements of this Manual.
   12.79.4. Provide non-essential personnel:
       12.79.4.1. K40 separation distance from the training site if more than 15 lbs NEWQD
       are being used for the exercise.
       12.79.4.2. 100 ft separation distance from the training site for NEWQD < 15 lbs.
   12.79.5. Minimize the number of samples and the quantity of explosives for each sample.
   On-site authorities will determine the total quantity of explosives permitted during an
   exercise considering:
       12.79.5.1. The value and importance of the exposed facilities.
       12.79.5.2. The exercise operating conditions.
       12.79.5.3. The available separation distance for non-essential personnel.
   12.79.6. Separate samples a sufficient distance apart to prevent an explosion from
   propagating from one sample to another.
   12.79.7. Not use any initiating devices or initiating explosives.
   12.79.8. Not place explosives near any heat or spark producing items (e.g., bare electrical
   wiring, radiators, electric heaters, heating vents, etc.).
   12.79.9. Not place explosives in metal containers or other means of confinement that could
   produce fragments in the event of an accidental explosion.
12.80. Demilitarization Operations for Expended 50-Caliber and Smaller Cartridge
Casings..
   12.80.1. A demilitarization operation for processing expended .50-caliber and smaller
   cartridge cases can be treated as a non-explosive operation provided:
       12.80.1.1. Cartridge casings to be processed are screened prior to processing. (Note:
       Screening is intended to ensure that only .50-caliber and smaller are processed, and to
       remove unused .50-caliber and smaller cartridges.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   261


      12.80.1.2. Demilitarization processing equipment is tested to be capable of containing
      overpressure, fragment, and thermal hazards associated with a worst-case reaction
      involving a single live round of the most energetic cartridge that could be processed in
      the equipment.
      12.80.1.3. Demilitarization processing equipment is operated within the manufacturer's
      specifications and restricted only to the processing of expended .50-caliber and smaller
      cartridge casings.
      12.80.1.4. Demilitarization processing equipment is inspected and maintained to ensure
      safe operation.
   12.80.2. MAJCOMs will:
      12.80.2.1. Approve the use of specific demilitarization processing equipment.
      12.80.2.2. Establish and implement procedures for:
          12.80.2.2.1. Screening and segregating the material to be processed.
          12.80.2.2.2. Operating, inspecting, and maintaining the demilitarization processing
          equipment to ensure safe operation.
          12.80.2.2.3. Dispositioning of processed material.
   12.80.3. Demilitarization processing operation locations meeting the requirements of
   paragraphs 12.80.1 and 12.80.2 do not require siting as a PES. As an ES, they must be
   located at ILD from all PESs, except from the PES from which it is integral.
12.81. POL and Other Hazardous Materials.
   12.81.1. Unprotected, aboveground bulk storage tanks ( > 5,000 gallons) for hazardous
   materials (e.g., POL, liquid petroleum) will be separated from all PESs by IBD. A dike
   system satisfying NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers is required.
   Aboveground storage tanks that are provided protection against rupture or collapse from blast
   and fragment hazards may be sited at lesser distances when supported by testing or analysis.
   12.81.2. Smaller unprotected, aboveground bulk storage tanks ( < 5,000 gallons) will be
   separated from all PESs IAW paragraph 12.81.1. When this criteria cannot be met, weigh
   the cost of distance or protective construction against the strategic value of the stored
   material, the ease of replacement in the event of an accident, and the potential environmental
   impact. Reduced distances may be approved if the responsible commander accepts the
   possible loss of the tanks and any collateral damage that a fire might cause as a result of the
   tanks being punctured by fragments.
   12.81.3. Railroad tank car and transfer points or operations, tank trucks, POL transmission
   pipelines, and hydrants will be separated from all PESs by IBD. Fuel truck transfer points or
   operations may be separated by PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance, if the trucks are
   limited to less than 48 hours at the location.
   12.81.4. Unprotected, aboveground service tanks , to include fuel bladders, solely supporting
   AE storage or operating complexes that are supplied by a pipe system designed to resist blast
   and fragments may be sited at incremental IBD with a minimum distance of 400 ft from
   supported PESs provided:
 262                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       12.81.4.1. Aboveground lines, if used, must be equipped with automatic shut-off valves
       at the source.
       12.81.4.2. A dike system meeting the requirements of NFPA 430 is provided.
       12.81.4.3. Responsible commander accepts the possible loss of the tanks and any
       collateral damage that a fire might cause as a result of the tanks being punctured by
       fragments.
   12.81.5. A service tank (above or below ground) supporting a single PES or ES within an
   explosive clear zone does not require Q-D but will comply with NFPA 30.
   12.81.6. Small quantities of POL or other hazardous materials used for operational purposes
   require no specific separation distance for explosives safety; however, they will be separated
   as required by NFPA 30 or 50’, whichever is greatest. An example of this facility type
   would be small lockers used to store operational quantities of POL and other flammable
   materials in support of a single PES/ES. Operating procedures will be implemented to limit
   adverse environmental impacts in the event of an accidental explosion. This criteria does not
   apply to small daily use storage lockers located in operating environments.
   12.81.7. Separate parking areas for fuel service trucks by ILD with a minimum of 100 ft
   from related PESs, and IBD from unrelated PESs.
   12.81.8. Fixed refueling points will be sited at ILD with a 100’ minimum from all related
   PESs. An example of this type of facility is a remote, unmanned self-service station
   commonly located in munitions storage areas and flightline AGE shops.
   12.81.9. There must be at least 100 ft between explosives and any mobile petroleum
   dispensing unit operating in an explosives area, except where a shorter distance is needed
   during transfer operations to an underground tank located at less than 100 ft or where needed
   to refuel a mobile explosives transporter (such as the environmental control unit for the
   LGM-30) with the explosives load aboard.
   12.81.10. Buried tanks and buried pipelines should be separated from all PESs containing
   HD 1.2, HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 AE by at least 80 ft. The required separation distance for
   HD 1.1 or HD 1.5 AE is K3 with a minimum distance of 80 ft. Keep pumps and pump houses
   serving underground POL at least 50 ft from all PESs. If the PES is designed to contain the
   effects of an explosion, then no QD is required.
   12.81.11. Consider cut and cover POL tanks as underground if they have at least 3ft of earth
   cover (5ft recommended if the PES exposing the tank could generate large secondary debris
   fragments) are sited at K3. Unmanned cut and cover support facilities require ILD from all
   PES’s.
   12.81.12. The following are exempted from QD requirements:
       12.81.12.1. Explosives loaded aircraft to POL hydrants set on the flight line flush with
       the pavement.
       12.81.12.2. Ammunition and explosives to in use material-handling equipment.
       12.81.12.3. Licensed locations to POL facilities.
12.82. Storage Tanks for Water and Other Non-Hazardous materials .
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     263


   12.82.1. Unprotected aboveground storage tanks and towers, whose loss is unacceptable,
   will be separated from all PESs by IBD. (See paragraph 10.24) Aboveground storage tanks
   that are provided protection against rupture or collapse from blast and fragment hazards may
   be sited at lesser distances when supported by testing or analysis.
   12.82.2. QD criteria do not apply to storage tanks and associated components if loss is
   acceptable to the responsible commander.
12.83. Underground Tanks or Pipelines for Water and Other Non-Hazardous
Materials. Underground tanks or pipelines for non-hazardous materials whose loss is
unacceptable, will meet the siting requirements of paragraph 12.81.10. QD criteria do not apply
if loss is acceptable to the responsible commander.
12.84. Utilities and Services.
   12.84.1. Utilities include: steam, water, natural gas, POL lines, sewage, air lines, electrical
   lines, communication lines, and environmental facilities or equipment. The term ―utility‖
   does not apply to services provided to individual or grouped explosives facilities when that
   service is not also secondarily provided to other parts of the installation or community. The
   following requirements apply to utilities:
       12.84.1.1. Aboveground electric distribution lines carrying less than 69 kilovolt (kv), the
       tower or poles supporting those lines, communication lines, and unmanned electrical
       substations will be no closer to PESs than PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance.
       12.84.1.2. Aboveground electric transmission lines carrying 69 kv or more and the tower
       or poles supporting them will be located no closer to PESs than:
           12.84.1.2.1. IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, if the line in question is part
           of a grid system serving a large off-base area.
           12.84.1.2.2. PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance, if loss of the line will not
           create serious social or economic hardships.
       12.84.1.3. Aboveground electric transmission/distribution lines which can be interrupted
       without loss of power (i.e., power is rerouted through existing lines or networks) will be
       separated from explosives sites in accordance with paragraph 12.84.2.
       12.84.1.4. Utilities that provide vital functions to a major portion of an installation will
       be no closer to PESs than IBD.
       12.84.1.5. Power and utilities functions including power plants, compressor stations, and
       electric power transformers that serve an entire base complex, or when loss of the facility
       will cause an immediate loss of vital function, will be no closer to PESs than IBD.
       12.84.1.6. Underground electrical and communications lines may be sited at K3 with no
       minimum distance required.       Other underground utilities will meet the siting
       requirements of paragraph 12.81.10.
   12.84.2. Overhead electric service lines (running past an explosives facility but not serving
   it) will be no closer to a combustible explosives facility or to an open explosives facility than
   the length of the electric lines between the nearest service poles and the length of the nearest
   service pole. An exception is when an effective means (e.g., line spacers, weights, etc.) is
 264                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   provided to ensure that energized lines on breaking cannot come into contact with the facility
   or its appurtenances. No separation is required for non-combustible facilities.
   12.84.3. Manned auxiliary services including auxiliary power plants, compressor stations,
   and electric power transformers, may be located at ILD from PESs they support.
   12.84.4. Unmanned auxiliary services (e.g., transformer stations, water treatment and
   pollution abatement facilities) that serve an explosives area, but are not an integral function
   in the explosives area, and that would not create an immediate secondary hazard if lost, may
   be located at barricaded ILD from the PESs they support, even though such services need not
   be barricaded.
   12.84.5. Unmanned auxiliary service power generation or conversion facilities (e.g., power
   plants, transformers, etc.) that exclusively supply power to an explosives area or security
   fence lighting may be located at fire protection distance (50 ft for non-combustible ES
   structures, 100 ft for combustible ES structures) from all PESs in the supported explosives
   area.
   12.84.6. Unmanned above ground utility services (e.g., water treatment, pollution abatement
   facilities, water pump stations, sewage lift stations, etc.) that do not serve an explosives area
   or an entire base complex, and when loss will not cause an immediate loss of a vital function
   may be located at PTRD with no minimum fragment distance.
   12.84.7. See paragraph 5.9. for design requirements for electrical lines serving a PES.
12.85. LGM-30 (Minuteman). Use Table 12.27 to determine high explosives equivalency for
the LGM-30 missile when calculating QD separations.
   12.85.1. Calculate NEWQD for motor sets (Stages I, II, and III), assembled or unassembled,
   with HD 1.1 material, on HD 1.1 equivalency basis unless the HD 1.3 hazard is greater.
   12.85.2. When only HD 1.3 motors are present, use total NEWQD of the motors, and apply
   HD 1.3 QD criteria. For LGM-30G motors use HD 1.3 QD criteria for shipping and storage
   purposes. When a warhead is added to the assembled set, the 7,400-lb high explosives
   equivalency applies. Safety distances are based on 7,400 lbs HD 1.1 high explosive
   equivalency for all LGM-30 missile motor sets (models A through G) with or without a
   warhead installed. IBD is 1,570 ft from buildings of public assembly and 1,200 ft from all
   other inhabited buildings.
   12.85.3. Separations for aircraft loading and unloading sites for solid propellant motors in
   shipping and storage containers, Ballistic Missile Containers (SSCBM) and Payload
   Transporter Container: IBD is 1,200 ft (includes missile holding pads, facilities, aircraft or
   other equipment essential to the mission of the base; PTRD is 720 ft.
   12.85.4. Aircraft Loading and Unloading Sites. When an aircraft loaded with these
   motors must be refueled, a fully staffed fire fighting truck will be on standby at the aircraft
   during fueling operations.
   12.85.5. Railroad Loading and Unloading Sites. Criteria in paragraph 8.54 apply to
   railroad loading and unloading sites for Minuteman missile motors in the SSCBM and
   missile transporters shipped by the ―piggyback‖ method.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                       265


   12.85.6. Missile Alert Facility (MAF). Explosives-loaded vehicles (payload transporter,
   reentry vehicle guidance and control van, transporter erector) may be temporarily parked at
   the MAF, subject to the following controls:
      12.85.6.1. Each instance must be approved by the wing or installation commander or his
      designated representative.
      12.85.6.2. Allow parking if needed for severe weather, equipment breakdown and repair,
      crew rest, darkness (where state law prohibits vehicle travel on highways after dark) or
      other emergency conditions.
      12.85.6.3. No smoking outside missile alert facility support buildings.
      12.85.6.4. Park only one explosives-loaded vehicle.
      12.85.6.5. Publish a detailed operating instruction of safety precautions and controls.
      12.85.6.6. Ensure required security is maintained.
12.86. LGM-118 (Peacekeeper). Use Table 12.28 to determine high explosives equivalency
for the LGM-118 missile when calculating QD separations.
   12.86.1. Peacekeeper Separation. General explosives safety standards and QD criteria apply
   to the Peacekeeper except as follows: when stages 1, 2, and 3 are assembled at other than a
   silo launch facility (with or without stage 4 warheads being attached), the net explosives
   equivalency for the missile is 203,412 lbs HD 1.1.
   12.86.2. When the missile is in a silo launch facility or during missile installation or removal
   from the silo, the net explosives equivalency is 20,000 lbs HD 1.1. This equivalency is to be
   used only for calculating IMD and ILD separations, and for use in risk assessments based on
   blast overpressure. Applicable distance for PTRD is 1,050 ft and for IBD is 1,750 ft.
12.87. Inter-DoD Component Support and Tactical Facilities.
   12.87.1. General.
      12.87.1.1. The separation distances in paragraph 12.87.2 will apply between facilities of
      one DoD Component to those of another DoD Component regardless of the location of
      the boundaries.
      12.87.1.2. Other safety criteria (e.g., toxicity, noise, radiation, flight trajectory, etc.) may
      require greater distances. In these situations, the predominant hazard criteria apply.
   12.87.2. The following minimum QD relationships apply:
      12.87.2.1. AE storage facilities will be separated by IMD.
      12.87.2.2. AE storage or operating locations of one DoD Component will be separated
      from AE operating locations of another DoD Component by IBD. (See paragraph
      12.87.2.3 for an exception to this criteria.)
      12.87.2.3. Explosive operations that present a similar degree of hazard or involve joint or
      support operations will be separated by ILD.
      12.87.2.4. AE storage or operating locations of one DoD Component will be separated
      from AE tactical facilities of another DoD Component by IBD. For joint or support
 266                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       operations, determine the separation distance as though both facilities belonged to a
       single DoD Component.
12.88. Criteria for non-DoD Explosives Activities on DoD Installations.
   12.88.1. Non-DoD explosives activities will only be conducted on DoD property per Table
   12.29. These non-DoD explosives activities must also comply with Bureau of Alcohol,
   Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other Federal,
   State, and local regulations. Definitions for the terminology used in Table 12.29 can be
   found in Attachment 1.
   12.88.2. For these types of non-DoD explosives activities, DoD will only be responsible for
   ensuring that IMD requirements, as outlined in explosives site plan submissions, are met.
   DoD oversight of these non-DoD explosives activities is not intended.
   12.88.3. Non-DoD, explosives activities will be evaluated based on IMD between multiple
   PES to ensure non-propagation. Where IMD is not met, then non-DoD, explosives activity's
   sites will be added to determine the applicable IMD or IBD to DoD sites.
   12.88.4. In Table 12.29, ―Check for IM‖ means if IMD is not maintained between each PES,
   explosives quantities will be totaled.
   12.88.5. IBD will be determined based on this Manual.
   12.88.6. The DoD site approval for non-DoD, explosives activities is limited to the area
   encumbered by the IBD arcs.
   12.88.7. Review of building design, lightning protection, etc., is not necessary unless design
   features are used as justification to reduce the IBD arc.

Section 12P—-Space and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Requirements

12.89. General Information. This section establishes explosives safety standards for storing,
staging, maintaining, processing, assembling, handling, and testing large solid rocket motors
(LSRM) and liquid propellants used in conjunction with space launch systems and
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) test launches, and provides methods and criteria for
mitigating the pre-launch risks associated with these operations.
   12.89.1. These standards apply to Air Force locations that process, launch, and test launch
   vehicles or ballistic missiles containing more than 1,000 pounds of liquid propellants or more
   than 10,000 pounds of solid propellants. Quantity Distance criteria for space and ICBM
   systems is found in paragraph 12.97.
   12.89.2. Space launch vehicles and ICBM class missile systems use large quantities of
   energetic materials as fuel and oxidizer for their propulsion systems. Typically, these
   propulsion systems contain liquid or solid propellants in thousand to million pound
   quantities. These launch vehicles and missile systems can, under launch conditions, react
   much more violently than during conditions such as transportation, storage, and handling.
   Launch conditions include vehicles in a fully pressurized configuration such as during
   countdowns and rehearsals, and testing on test stands. Pressurized vehicles can present a
   hazard to a wide area, in some cases miles of exposure. The combination of the potential for
   large explosions coupled with possible wide dispersion of the threat requires different
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   267


   methods of mitigating explosive hazards than normally used for non-dynamic hazards
   analysis, hazard classification, threat mitigation, and quantity-distance siting. These hazards
   and mitigating techniques will be contained in range or test requirement documents.
12.90. Support Facilities. These include those facilities used to store, stage, or process large
rocket motors and motor segments. The same facility may be used for both staging and
processing these motors. Take thermal and toxic properties as well as potential explosive effects
in accordance with applicable directives such as UFC 3-340-02, Structures to Resist the Effects
of Accidental Explosions, into consideration prior to selecting or constructing operational
maintenance and staging facilities for large rocket motors and motor segments.
   12.90.1. Facility design and operational processing flow must keep the physical movement
   of these large rocket motors and motor segments to an absolute minimum. Limit the
   operations performed in these facilities to those associated with the primary function of the
   facility. Establish safety control areas as defined in paragraph 12.91., for all hazardous
   operations in these facilities.
   12.90.2. There are two basic types of support facilities for large solid rocket motors (LSRM)
   and motor segments; a Motor Operations and Staging Facility, and a Motor Storage Facility.
       12.90.2.1. Motor Operations and Staging Facility. This facility is primarily used to
       process and assemble LSRMs and motor segments for launch operations. It also has the
       capability for staging and maintaining motors and motor segments. Conduct operations
       involved with preparing LSRMs and motor segments using approved receipt-to-launch
       procedures or other approved technical data. Unlike many explosives operating buildings
       which currently exist on military installations, the large motor facilities may have many
       direct support personnel simultaneously performing different tasks in support of the
       launch preparation. These personnel must be limited to the minimum number necessary
       to accomplish the operation. Personnel limits will be established in the operating
       procedures. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance may be performed in this facility
       on motors and segments in the staging area. Limit maintenance of large rocket motors
       and motor segments in the staging area to periodic maintenance and inspections unless a
       hazard risk analysis indicates other operations may be safely performed. When
       unscheduled or unforeseen operations must be accomplished on motor segments in the
       staging area, the appropriate technical team will perform an operational risk assessment
       in accordance with AFPAM 90-902. Air Force explosives safety personnel will then
       evaluate and obtain approval of the safety risk assessment at the appropriate command
       level.
       12.90.2.2. Motor Storage Facility. This facility is primarily used for long term storage
       of motors and motor segments. Keep the movement of LSRMs and motor segments into
       and out of storage to an absolute minimum. Hazardous operations normally performed in
       these facilities involve lifting and positioning LSRMs and motor segments. Selected
       maintenance operations may be performed in these facilities provided they are limited to
       periodic maintenance inspections using approved procedures. Unscheduled operations,
       such as repairs or the correction of discrepancies found during periodic inspections, may
       be performed in these facilities if a risk assessment concludes it is less hazardous to
       perform the maintenance in the facility than to move the segment to another isolated
       facility. If Government resources are at risk, the wing commander or equivalent
 268                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       commander must approve the task before it begins. If only commercial resources are at
       risk, risk assessment is the responsibility of the commercial operator. Use only
       commander approved and safety reviewed/approved procedures when maintaining or
       repairing LSRMs and motor segments.
   12.90.3. MAJCOMs will determine whether two operations involving LSRM’s are
   dissimilar with respect to the hazards presented hence require ILD separation. Factors to
   consider when making this determination are:
       12.90.3.1. The explosive characteristics and quantities of explosives involved in each
       operation.
       12.90.3.2. The end use of the LSRM’s undergoing preparation.
       12.90.3.3. The make up of the teams performing the operations (e.g. Will the same team
       be performing both operations).
   12.90.4. When contractor owned LSRM’s undergoing preparation might be used for both
   DoD or commercial payloads of dissimilar programs and are within ILD, risk analysis and
   acceptance must be accomplished and approved by the responsible contract program offices
   and installation commander.
   12.90.5. LSRM’s earmarked for DoD weapons or specific missions directed by presidential
   mandate in support of national defense (currently Minuteman III and Missile Defense
   Agency resources) must be separated from non-DoD assets by IBD.
12.91. Safety Control Area. A safety control area is an area where personnel and equipment
exposure is controlled in order to limit the risk from hazardous explosives operations. For
LSRM segments, the safety control area is generally a circular area centered where the ordnance
task is taking place; it has a radius of IBD based on the quantity of explosives which may
become involved in a mishap. Certain engineering controls may allow a reduction or
modification in the size of the safety control area. Only one hazardous explosives operation may
take place in a safety control area at a time. Personnel required to be in the safety control area
during an explosives operation will be considered essential personnel; conversely, people who do
not meet this definition will be considered non-essential.
12.92. Simultaneous Operations. The large size of motor segments allows multiple operations
to be easily conducted simultaneously on a single element, but the potential hazards that one task
may present to another task must be carefully assessed before allowing more than one operations
to proceed. Personnel performing processing or maintenance tasks on LSRM segments must be
aware of other tasks that may be in progress on the same segment. Only a single operation may
be performed within the same safety control area at a time.
12.93. Barricades. Use barricades with fixed storage tanks to prevent high velocity fragments
from a ground liquid fuel propellant vapor phase confined explosion striking a test vehicle on the
test stand. Design these barricades according to the criteria in paragraph 6.15.
12.94. Space Launch Complex. A space launch complex consists of a group of related
facilities used for launching space vehicles. Facilities generally included are the launch pad(s),
liquid propellant storage tanks, site instrumentation facilities, engineering personnel support
buildings and a blockhouse. Additional facilities could also include LSRM facilities and
spacecraft processing facilities. A launch complex normally involves a variety of explosive
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                       269


hazards, the result of the presence of various quantities of liquid and solid propellants which can
produce both mass fire and detonation explosive hazards. System safety engineering hazard
analyses of the complex must be performed to identify the various explosive hazards, their
relationships, the safety threat zones and launch area location. . Quantity Distance criteria is
found in paragraph 12.97.
12.95. Space Test Facilities. Space test facilities normally consist of a wide array of test
resources to support customers including flight hardware (ballistic, space, sounding rocket
launch vehicles and satellites) and ground systems (field test, assembly and storage, launch, and
on-orbit test facilities). A space test facility typically includes liquid propellant storage tanks or
test site instrumentation, facility engineering personnel support buildings and a control center.
The facilities normally involve a variety of liquid and solid propellants which can produce both
mass fire and detonation explosive hazards. System safety engineering hazard analyses of the
facilities must be performed to identify the various hazards, their relationships, the safety threat
zones, etc.
12.96. Risk Management. Use the principles of Risk Management (RM) found in AFPAM 90-
902, and the standard practices in Mil-Std 882, Systems Safety Program Requirements, to
identify and assess potential hazards, then to determine and implement controls to minimize the
risks associated with operations involving LSRMs and motor segments.
   12.96.1. The major hazards associated with space launch vehicles and missile prelaunch and
   propulsion test operations involve large quantities of propellants used in propulsion systems,
   destruct charges, and high pressure gas systems.
   12.96.2. Perform hazard assessments to measure the potential for and consequences of
   mishaps resulting from the undesired release of energy or inhibiting the desired release of
   energy. Use these assessments to define the maximum credible event (MCE).
   12.96.3. Assess all launch vehicle operations to evaluate the hazards and determine the
   mitigating activities necessary to achieve an acceptable level of risk, both for personnel and
   the launch or test site.
   12.96.4. Determine the expected risk before beginning any potentially hazardous operation
   and get approval from the appropriate supervisory level before proceeding. Risk analyses
   must show that the potential benefits outweigh the cost in terms of overall risk before the
   operation may be approved.
   12.96.5. Credible Failure Modes. In order to determine the potential threat that a given
   launch vehicle and support system configuration poses during prelaunch or propulsive test
   operations, credible failure modes must be defined. The specific failure mode that occurs
   will have a large influence on the explosive yield and the resultant blast overpressure,
   fragmentation, and thermal effects and thus on the severity of the accident environments, risk
   to personnel, and damage to facilities. General scenario categories include the following
   phases and operations:
       12.96.5.1. Prelaunch and Test Operations:
           12.96.5.1.1. Storage
           12.96.5.1.2. Handling
           12.96.5.1.3. Assembly
270                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


         12.96.5.1.4. Checkout (at the assembly building and at the launch or test complex)
         12.96.5.1.5. Final Assembly
         12.96.5.1.6. Ordnance Installation
         12.96.5.1.7. Propellant Loading
         12.96.5.1.8. All-up Vehicle Checkout (prior to launch and static firing)
  12.96.6. General Failure Modes. Handle the failure modes for liquid propellants and solid
  propellants separately because their geometric and chemical configurations are different. In
  the case of solid propellants, the fuel and oxidizer are already mixed homogeneously,
  therefore the failure scenarios do not have to account for mixing. Liquid propellants, on the
  other hand, are configured in separate storage or launch vehicle tanks, therefore the failure
  scenarios must account for the type, amount, and probability of mixing propellants.
  12.96.7. Typical Prelaunch Failure Mode Scenarios:
      12.96.7.1. Storage
         12.96.7.1.1. Liquid propellant scenarios primarily involve leaking or ruptured
         propellant tanks caused by loss of pressure control, insulation deficiencies,
         mechanical damage, and corrosion. Fuel and oxidizers are normally stored
         separately, so a maximum credible event would be limited to a fire and tank pressure
         rupture.
         12.96.7.1.2. Solid propellant accident scenarios can be defined by the hazard
         classification grouping - 1.1 mass detonation, or 1.3 - mass fire. The most likely
         candidates to cause accidental ordnance initiation are introduction of stray electrical
         energy, fire, and dropping the segment with sufficient impact force to initiate the
         propellant or destruct charge if present.
      12.96.7.2. Handling.
         12.96.7.2.1. Handle liquid oxidizer and fuel separately using independent closed loop
         systems. Normally, differential pressure is used to transfer product from one holding
         tank to another or to load a launch vehicle. Typical accident events are limited to
         system leaks, vent and scrubber failures, or at worst, a tank rupture caused by over- or
         under-pressurization. Launch vehicle propellant loading scenarios are discussed in
         another section. Load liquid propellants serially to further reduce prelaunch mixing
         hazards.
         12.96.7.2.2. Solid propellant rocket motors are handled by lifting with cranes or
         erectors at static test stands, the launch mount, in a processing facility, or by various
         transportation modes. Typically the MCE scenario involves vehicle rollover, or drop
         impacts during lifting or transportation. Drop impacts on hard surfaces can cause
         propellant ignition.
      12.96.7.3. Booster Assembly.
         12.96.7.3.1. Launch vehicle assembly processes normally do not involve liquid
         propellants.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   271


          12.96.7.3.2. Assembly operations for solid propellant rocket motors typically involve
          the same credible accident scenarios as those listed for handling.
       12.96.7.4. Booster Checkout. Booster checkout normally does not impose additional
       hazards above and beyond those already listed except that the potential for inadvertent
       ignition of electro-explosive devices (EEDs) or inadvertent function of propellant system
       isolation valves is increased during certain electrical system checkouts. At-pad or test
       stand checkout normally is accomplished after solid propellant and hypergolic propellant
       stages are assembled and loaded, therefore, multi-faceted threats exist with interaction
       between hypergolic and solid propellants that can result in fires, pressure ruptures, and
       propulsive flight.
       12.96.7.5. Final Assembly. The launch booster, upper stages, and payload final
       assembly process normally is accomplished on the launch pad. Both solid propellants
       and hypergolic liquid propellants are present during the final assembly steps. A major
       threat involves the assembly and encapsulation of spacecraft and upper stages in facilities
       off the launch complex. These operations normally involve hypergolic propellants
       loaded in separate propellant tanks. Credible accident scenarios include puncture of one
       or more of the propellant tanks during assembly or checkout, impact caused by lifting,
       failure resulting in a dropped system, or over- or under pressurization. Since these
       propellants are hypergolic; the potential exists for a fire if the fuel comes into contact
       with an oxidizer. Another major threat involves the toxicity of these propellants.
       Credible accident scenarios primarily involve handling, lifting, and mating stages with
       tank rupture accident scenarios the result of impacts caused by improper handling or
       dropping one or more stages. The results are the same as those listed above.
       12.96.7.6. Ordnance Installation. Ordnance installation may take place in an off-the-
       pad assembly building or on the launch pad. During and after installation, credible
       accident scenarios primarily involve inadvertent ignition of EEDs. These devices must
       not be capable of detonating either the solid or liquid propellant. Inadvertent ignition of
       these devices can result in significant damage to the vehicle and severe injury or death to
       personnel. Unless unavoidable, do not load cryogenic liquid propellants on a launch
       vehicle until after ordnance is installed.
       12.96.7.7. Propellant Loading. Maximum credible event accident scenarios during
       propellant loading involve over- or under-pressurization of the propellant tanks and major
       spills of fuel and oxidizer. These scenarios can result in a significant explosive yield.
       12.96.7.8. All-Up Vehicle Checkout. This occurs prior to launch or static firing.
       During this phase of prelaunch operations the final liquid propellant topping off is
       completed and in some cases the liquid propellant and high pressure gas systems are
       brought to flight pressure. All systems are switched to internal power and final systems
       checks are performed. The MCE involves the fully loaded launch vehicle and payload.
       Explosive yield is based on static conditions for shock impact on solid propellants and
       non-dynamic mixing of liquid propellant either by the Confined by Missile (CBM) mode
       or the Confined by Ground Surface (CBGS) mode.
12.97. Space and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Criteria.

  12.97.1. Some launch pad facilities such as mobile service towers, umbilical mast towers,
  launch ducts, blockhouse, and launch mounts are identified by a building number on the base
  master plan. But, for the purpose of explosive site planning, they are considered an ―integral
  part of the facility‖ and do not require exposed site separation distances due to the nature of
  their function. Likewise, facilities that provide direct support to these launch pads such as
  maintenance and build-up shops, pressurization systems, instrumentation terminal rooms,
  etc., are an integral part of the facility and do not require QD separation distances from the
  pads they support.
  12.97.2. Technical support areas may be associated with these facilities. Locate all direct
  support personnel at no less than IL distance or equivalent protection from the PES and
  dispatch them to the PES as required.
  12.97.3. Locate any parking lots (GOV or POV) which exclusively serves the motor or
  motor storage, staging, or operations facility according to Chapter 12.
  12.97.4. Locate launch complexes at Air Force launch ranges using two sets of criteria. The
  first set is based on QD criteria. They address pre-launch operations (including pressurized
  launch rehearsal) and static explosive threats. These will be defined for each facility in the
  explosives safety site plan. The TNT equivalencies to be used are included in Table 12.17.
  The second set of criteria used to locate a launch complex on the range address launch and
  space vehicle dynamic flight. Range safety guidance will define the criteria and flight safety
  analysis techniques required to determine the down range explosive threat resulting from a
  launch.
      12.97.4.1. Separate new launch pads by at least an IL distance from each other. The
      larger NEW of the two launch vehicles will dictate the minimum separation between the
      two launch pads. For HD 1.1 launch vehicles, the minimum separation required is K-18.
      For HD 1.3 launch vehicles, Table 12.3, IL column. Hazardous operations in one facility
      may impact operations in another related facility. In order to protect personnel, IB
      quantity distance criteria between launch pads shall be considered for new construction,
      as opposed to IL distances.
      12.97.4.2. Determine launch complex locations in the range launch area based on flight
      safety analyses including risk analysis such as the Launch Area Risk Analysis (LARA)
      program and other flight safety techniques described in range safety guidance. The
      Range Safety Office responsible for a launch area will consider explosive siting and
      missile flight hazards when determining the location of a launch complex in relationship
      with other launch complexes and support facilities.
      12.97.4.3. For QD purposes, measure from the explosives at the launch mount, for a
      launch complex and at the test stand, for a test complex.
  12.97.5. Space Test Facilities. During explosives site planning for new motor or motor
  segment test operation facilities, provide a personnel direct support facility at least ILD from
  the PES. Note: This separate location will permanently house direct support personnel for
  the PES. It will be a dispatch point, break room, and change room for these personnel.
  These direct support personnel facilities may be located at closer than IL distances if
  protective measures are used to provide minimum required overpressure and fragment
  protection. Use the prevailing wind direction as a primary consideration when locating test
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    273


  stands in relationship to other facilities that will be inhabited during testing. Non-DoD
  LSRM test facilities on Air Force installations must not hazard Government assets. Use
  Table 12.29. to determine siting criteria for non-DoD activities.
  12.97.6. Static Test Facilities. Site and construct static test facilities for maximum
  flexibility to meet frequently changing technological requirements. A typical static test
  facility will have several test stands that share common support facilities such as ready
  storage tanks, pressurization systems, test control rooms, maintenance support and build-up
  shops, and steam-generating vacuum systems. To the extent possible, separate test stands by
  intraline distance. In some cases test support requirements, such as vacuum testing, do not
  support QD separation if test objectives are to be achieved. To minimize the risk to adjacent
  test stands, only one test stand will be used at a time when QD requirements cannot be met.
  Remove or protect all equipment not being used to support current test operations, or obtain a
  waiver approved at the appropriate level. See Chapter 1 for waiver or exemption procedures.
  12.97.7. Building and Use of Non-DoD Space Explosives Facilities on Air Force
  Installations and Non-DoD Use of Existing Government Facilities. Air Force guidance
  permits a non-DoD space user to lease land on an Air Force installation and construct
  explosives facilities to support non-DoD and Government space operations. Additionally, a
  non-DoD space user may be granted a license to use an existing Government explosives
  facility. These facilities include but are not limited to explosives storage facilities,
  explosives operations facilities, missile launch pads, test facilities, and combinations thereof.
  Use Table 12.29. for QD criteria for siting non-DoD activities.
  12.97.8. DoD Explosives Hazard Classification. Apply DoD explosives hazard
  classifications to explosives stored or used on military installations and reflect them in all
  applicable facility explosives site plans. For commercial explosive items that have not been
  acquired and adopted for use by the Air Force, but will be stored and transported on an Air
  Force installation in conjunction with commercial launch programs, the following exceptions
  may be applied:
     12.97.8.1. The items may be offered for transportation off the installation via
     commercial carriers using hazard classification approvals issued to the item
     manufacturers by the Department of Transportation (DOT).
     12.97.8.2. An item may be stored, handled, and transported on the installation using the
     hazard classification approval issued by DOT if the local commander reviews and
     concurs with that hazard classification, except for articles assigned to hazard
     class/division 1.2. These must be stored and handled as DoD hazard class/division 1.1.
     Obtain approval to store non-DoD commercial items as hazard class/division 1.2 from a
     DoD hazard classification authority listed in TO 11A-1-47.
  12.97.9. Expanding QD and Risk Assessment. Problems are encountered around launch
  pads and test stands where lack of real estate coupled with a high concentration of people,
  facilities, and equipment make compliance with QD standards impossible. Explosive content
  of a launch pad or test stand varies according to a well defined operational concept and the
  maximum NEW is typically present only during a short period of time just before launch or
  test. This allows management to take actions to protect or remove resources and personnel as
  the NEW is increased.
274                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


  12.97.10. Expanding QD. Expanding QD is a process available to commanders similar to
  tiered siting which allows them to analyze and minimize risk to personnel, facilities, and
  operational capabilities. Expanding QD is a risk-based management tool that provides an
  organized way to evaluate risks and assess action that will mitigate the impact of an
  explosive mishap during periods of increased activity. In an expanding QD system, a launch
  pad or test stand may have different NEWs during different stages of prelaunch or test
  missile buildup. To maximize protection under the expanding QD approach, the responsible
  commander will develop and publish procedures to ensure non-essential equipment, supplies,
  and personnel are removed prior to increasing NEW limits.
  12.97.11. Procedures for Expanding QD Risk Management. Determine launch pad or
  test stand NEW for various stages of launch vehicle buildup. For each stage, evaluate all ESs
  that are within the QD arc generated by the NEW. If QD criteria is not violated in the largest
  arc, submit a site plan for the maximum NEW. If violations exist, the following actions are
  required:
      12.97.11.1. Evacuate non-direct support personnel from an ES falling within the QD arc
      generated by the NEW. A waiver or exemption is required if the ES cannot be evacuated
      12.97.11.2. Publish procedures to minimize risk for stage with QD violations.
      Guidelines must specify:
         12.97.11.2.1. The organization responsible for implementing risk reduction actions.
         12.97.11.2.2. Conditions under which risk reduction actions will be directed and
         when they will take place.
         12.97.11.2.3. On-scene inspection procedures to ensure risk management actions are
         being accomplished.
         12.97.11.2.4. Facilities to be evacuated
         12.97.11.2.5. Critical equipment and supplies to be protected or evacuated
         12.97.11.2.6. Procedures to ensure the program is evaluated on a recurring basis.
      12.97.11.3. On the site plan, clearly label the different QD arcs associated with the
      different NEW levels.
  12.97.12. Blockhouse Requirements.
      12.97.12.1. Launch Complex Blockhouse. In general, the Air Force is moving away
      from the use of hardened blockhouses located at launch complexes in favor of soft,
      remote launch control centers. Until all operations requiring on-site manning in the
      blockhouse during launch are moved to remote locations, ensure blockhouse personnel
      are protected to a reasonable degree of safety. In the event of detonation of a launch
      vehicle on the launch pad or shortly after lift-off, the blockhouse must be able to
      withstand a direct impact of the largest expected amount of explosive debris and also the
      over-pressure resulting from the initial explosion and from subsequent explosions of
      firebrands landing nearby.
      12.97.12.2. Test Control Blockhouse. Blockhouses for static test stands can either be
      unprotected facilities at K-24 for the maximum propellant load, or be hardened facilities
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                        275


     capable of providing K-24 overpressure protection and fragment protection from the
     maximum propellant load.

                                     Notes for Table 12.1

1. Use this K-factor for NEWQD in PES up to 250,000 lbs.
2. Use this K-factor for NEWQD in PES greater than 250,000 lbs.
3. These barricades serve to mitigate both fragment and overpressure hazards. See Section 6E
for their requirements.
4. ECMs must meet the design requirements in Section 6C. Sectors (front/side/rear) of ECMs
are defined in paragraph 12.21. The front sector of an ECM is considered unbarricaded unless
barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards.
5. These barricades serve to mitigate fragment hazards. See Section 6D for their requirements.
6. AGMs are all types of above grade (non earth-covered) magazines or storage pads. This
includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and
trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives.
7. Although Barricaded Modules are considered AGMs, reduced QD (K1.1) may be applied
between modules provided the requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the
type of AE which may be stored in them, and prohibition on the use of heavy structures). If the
requirements of Section 6D are not met, use AGM criteria.
8. See paragraph 12.24.1.
9. See paragraph 12.24.2.
10. See paragraph 12.24.3.
11. See paragraph 12.24.4.
12. See Section 12F - Allowable Exposures, Section 12H – HD1.1 QD Criteria, and Section 12O
- QD criteria for specific facilities and systems.
13. Use Table 12.22 (K30 with an 111 foot minimum) to provide aircraft survivability from
blast overpressure. Additionally, barricades are required if protection from low-angle, high-
speed fragments is desired; side/rear of an ECM, or arch of a HAS, suffice as barricades for this
purpose.
14. Minimum required distance is K11, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section
6E is between the PES and ES. Combat aircraft may be separated at less than IMD provided:
        a. Their NEWQDs are combined to determine required QD to other exposures, and
        b. Approval is obtained from at least the Numbered Air Force (NAF) Vice Commander
owning the exposed aircraft (except for ARMCO revetted cells containing two aircraft). If
separation at less than IMD is required for support of a Unified Commander, the Major Air
Component Vice Commander having operational control of the aircraft will be the lowest
approval.
15. For QD purposes, an aircraft group is defined as two or more aircraft loaded with combat
configured explosives that are parked at less than IMD. Although they do not reduce the
required separation, intervening barricades are recommended. With NAF approval, K11
between groups may be used for contingency operations, per Chapter 13.
16. This distance may be reduced to K11, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of
Section 6E is between the PES and ES. See note 13 if survivability is desired.
17. Consider parked aeroclub aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of
aeroclub aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use.
18. MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft.
19. See paragraph 12.23 for IBD and PTRD separation criteria.
20. These distances may be reduced with MAJCOM approval.
 290                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


21. When required at overseas locations only, use K4.5 (or D=1.8Q1/3, where D is the distance
in meters and Q equals the NEWQD in kilograms). The use of this reduced separation depends
on operational necessity, providing the commander accepts the transient risk to military aircraft
movements. If siting facilities, the MAJCOM/CC or CV must provide AFSC/SEW a letter
listing all installations at which this separation distance will apply and state acceptance of
transient risk to military aircraft movements.
22. Use this row for locations in the open where passengers enplane and deplane.
23. Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger
terminal building.
24. Use this table for siting HD 1.5 (see paragraph 12.13.5).
25. This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure. For IMD protection,
this distance may be reduced to K9, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E
is between the PES and ES.
26. This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure. For IMD protection,
this distance may be reduced to K2.75.
27. This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure. For IMD protection,
this distance may be reduced to K2.75.
28. This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure. For IMD protection,
this distance may be reduced to K9, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E
is between the PES and ES.
29. Separations are based on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling,
servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when
maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters. If doors are left
open for extended periods, normal combat aircraft parking area apply to and from the front. as a
PES, parenthetical (xx) fragment distances do not apply except out the front of a Korean TAB
VEE HAS and out the front/rear of a Korean Flow-Through HAS.
30. HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.51.1. Sectors (front/side/rear)
of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21. A HAS arch or rear wall may be considered as a
barricade for application of K6, when applicable. The front sector of an HAS is considered
unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards. (See para 12.51.)
31. This distance provides aircraft survivability. For IMD protection, this distance may be
reduced to K11, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES
and ES.
32. Use Table 12.25B
33. Use Table 12.25A.
34. Use Table 12.24 (aircraft survivability) for separation between HASs, and between HASs
and HAS Ready Service ECMs/AGMs. The MAJCOM/CC/CV may approve the use of Table
12.23 (IMD equivalent separation).
35. IBD out the side is K62; IBD out the rear is K40; IBD out the front is K50.
36. See paragraph 12.23.
37. See paragraph 12.24.
38. See paragraph 12.40.
39. See paragraph 12.41.
40. See paragraph 12.42.

LEGEND:
(H)—Heavy Wall: Buildings with wall thickness > 12 inches of reinforced concrete; as an ES,
door must be barricaded (to mitigate fragment hazards per Section 6B) if it faces a PES.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                293


(H/R)—Heavy Wall and Roof: Buildings with wall thickness > 12 inches of reinforced concrete
and a roof thickness > 5.9 inches of reinforced concrete; as an ES, door must be barricaded (to
mitigate fragment hazards per Section 6B) if it faces a PES; side/rear exposures may or may not
be barricaded.
(L)—Light Wall: Light structure, open stack, truck, trailer, railcar, cargo aircraft
NOTES:
1. See Section 12F - Allowable Exposures for additional exposures and Section 12O - QD
criteria for specific facilities and systems.
2. When the NEWQD and the MCE of the packaged HD 1.2.1 items fall within the ranges
specified in equation (NEWQD < MCE < 450 lbs), the HD 1.2.1 will be treated as HD 1.1 and
the criteria of paragraph 12.23.1.1, as applicable, will be used (see paragraph 12.26.1).
3. When siting HD 1.2.3, cap the NEWQD of the largest single round at < 450 pounds, and cap
the (xx) at 1300 feet. These caps are for simplicity in siting and may be exceeded with
AFSC/SEW approval.
4. ECMs must meet the design requirements in Section 6C. Sectors (front/side/rear) of ECMs
are defined in paragraph 12.21. The front sector of an ECM is considered unbarricaded unless
barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards.
5. These barricades serve to mitigate fragment hazards. See Section 6E for their requirements.
6. AGMs are all types of above grade (non earth-covered) magazines or storage pads. This
includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and
trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives.
7. Required IMD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs: 200 ft
         HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs: 300 ft
         HD 1.2.2: 100 ft
         HD 1.2.3 to an ES containing only HD 1.2.3: 50 ft
         HD 1.2.3 to an ES containing other than HD 1.2.3: K11 based on the NEWQD of the
single round of the largest (greatest NEWQD) HD 1.2.3 item in the PES, with a 50 ft minimum
8. Although Barricaded Modules are considered AGMs, reduced QD may be applied between
modules, provided the requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the type of
AE which may be stored in them, and prohibition on the use of heavy structures). If the
requirements of Section 6D are not met, use AGM criteria. IM distance for HD 1.2.x. for
module to module separation is based on total NEWQD. MCE and LSRN are not used to
calculate IM distance between modules.
9. Required ILD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1 and 1.2.2: 50 ft
         HD 1.2.3: 36% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as
an AGM.
10. Required ILD separation is as follows:
HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3: 36% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating
the ES as an AGM.
11. Required ILD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1 and 1.2.2: IMD treating the ES as an AGM
         HD 1.2.3: 36% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as
an AGM.
 294                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


12. Apply PTRD separation per Note 21. If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM,
PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally
closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability or IBD separation per Note 17 for aircraft
survivability for all other relationships.
13. Apply PTRD separation per Note 22. If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM,
PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability or
IBD separation per Note 18 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships.
14. Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM. If aircraft survivability is mandated by
the MAJCOM, IBD separation per Note 17 is required for aircraft survivability.
15. Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM. If aircraft survivability is mandated by
the MAJCOM, IBD separation per Note 18 is required for aircraft survivability.
16. Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM.
17. Required IBD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs: 200 ft
         HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs: 300 ft
         HD 1.2.2: 100 ft
         HD 1.2.3: IBD per paragraph 12.27.2.1
18. Required IBD separation is as follows:
HD 1.2.1 in a structure/truck/trailer/railcar/cargo aircraft: IBD is the larger of the IBD from
Table 12.9 or the HDD from Table 12.10
HD 1.2.1 in the open/external a/c AE/stacks on open truck/trailer/railcar: IBD is the IBD from
Table 12.9
         HD 1.2.2: IBD is the IBD from Table 12.11
         HD 1.2.3: IBD per paragraph 12.27.2.1
19. Consider parked aeroclub aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of
aeroclub aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use.
20. MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft.
21. Required PTRD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs: 200 ft
         HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs: 300 ft
         HD 1.2.2: 100 ft
HD 1.2.3: 60% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as an
AGM (H or L)
22. Required PTRD separation is as follows:
HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3: 60% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating
the ES as an AGM (H or L).
23. When required at overseas locations only, use 125 ft. The use of this reduced separation
depends on operational necessity, providing the commander accepts the transient risk to military
aircraft movements. If siting facilities, the MAJCOM/CC or CV must provide AFSC/SEW a
letter listing all installations at which this separation distance will apply and state acceptance of
transient risk to military aircraft movements.
24. Use this row for locations in the open where passengers enplane and deplane.
25. Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger
terminal building.
26. Treat as an Operating Location to determine required ILD separation.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    295


27. No QD separation is required, unless the MAJCOM requires aircraft survivability (PTRD to
the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability; use IBD
separation per Note 18 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships).
28. No QD separation is required.
29. MAJCOMs will determine required QD separation.
30. ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.2 provided they meet separation
requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other exposures
comply with applicable QD criteria.
31. Separations are based on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling,
servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when
maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters. If doors are left
open for extended periods, normal combat aircraft parking area apply from the front.
32. HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.51.1. Sectors (front/side/rear)
of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21. The front sector of an HAS is considered unbarricaded
unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards. (See paragraph 12.51.)
33. First, Second and Third Generation HASs, and Korean TAB VEE HASs, sited for HD 1.2.1
MCE < 110 lbs, HD 1.2.2, or HD 1.2.3 LSRN<110 lbs do not generate a QD clear zone except
out the front. Korean Flow-Through HASs sited for HD 1.2.1 MCE < 110 lbs, HD 1.2.2, or HD
1.2.3 LSRN<110 lbs do not generate a QD clear zone except out the front and rear. Fire
protection distances still apply.
34. For a front exposure from a First, Second or Third Generation HAS, use the AGM (H/R)
criteria. For a front exposure from a Korean TAB VEE or Korean Flow-Through HAS, use the
AGM (L) criteria.
35. Treat First, Second, and Third Generation HAS as AGM (H/R), Korean TAB VEE side/rear
as an AGM (H/R) and front as an AGM (H or L), Korean Flow-Through side as an AGM (H/R)
and front/rear as an AGM (H or L)
36. Required ILD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3: 36% of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD
treating First, Second, and Third Generation as an AGM (H/R), Korean TAB VEE side/rear as an
AGM (H/R) and front as an AGM (H or L), Korean Flow-Through side as an AGM (H/R) and
front/rear as an AGM (H or L)
37. MAJCOM may require aircraft survivability (PTRD to the front of HAS with doors
normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability; use IBD separation per Note 18 for
aircraft survivability for all other relationships).
38. Treat the PES as an AGM: for a front exposure from a First, Second or Third Generation
HAS, use (H/R) criteria; for a front exposure from a Korean TAB VEE or Korean Flow-Through
HAS, use (L) criteria. Treat the ES as an Operating Location: to a First, Second, and Third
Generation use (H/R) criteria; to the side/rear of a Korean TAB VEE use (H/R) criteria and to
the front use (H or L) criteria; to the side of a Korean Flow-Through use (H/R) criteria and to the
front/rear use (H or L) criteria.
39. Separations are based on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling,
servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when
maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters. If doors are left
open for extended periods, treat the front exposure as an Operating Location (H or L).
40. See paragraph 12.40.
41. See paragraph 12.41.
 296                                                              AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


42. See paragraph 12.42.
43. Practical considerations such as firefighting and security will dictate specific separation
distance requirements.

NOTES:
1. See Section 12F - Allowable Exposures for additional exposures and Section 12O - QD
criteria for specific facilities and systems.
2. ECMs must meet the design requirements in Section 6C. Sectors (front/side/rear) of ECMs
are defined in paragraph 12.21. The front sector of an ECM is considered unbarricaded unless
barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards.
3. AGMs are all types of above grade (non earth-covered) magazines or storage pads. This
includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and
trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives.
 298                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


4. The requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the type of AE which may
be stored in them, and prohibition on the use of heavy structures). If the requirements of Section
6D are not met, use AGM criteria. HD 1.3 is not allowed in modules.
5. Consider parked aeroclub aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of
aeroclub aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use.
6. MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft.
7. Use this row for locations in the open where passengers enplane and deplane.
8. Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger
terminal building.
9. ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.3 and 1.4 provided they meet
separation requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other
exposures comply with applicable QD criteria.
10. HD 1.4S may be stored (including associated handling) without regard to QD criteria (see
paragraphs 12.29.3 and 2.23.).
11. Magazines storing only HD 1.4 may be located at IMD (per Table 12.13.) to all other
explosives facilities (regardless of HD of NEWQD authorized in these facilities). Because the
HD 1.4 may be destroyed as the result of a mishap involving the assets in these adjacent
explosives facilities, the responsible commander must accept the potential loss of the HD 1.4
stocks and the storage structure. The commander’s risk acceptance must be documented by
letter (i.e., signed by the commander stating he/she understands and accepts the potential loss of
the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure in the event of a mishap in an adjacent explosives
facility) and submitted as part of the explosives site plan. A new risk acceptance letter does not
need to be generated when a new adjacent explosives facility is sited, as long as the original
letter documented that other such structures might be added in future.
12. Required IMD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.3:          See Table 12.12 IMD & ILD Column
         HD 1.4:          See Table 12.13 ECM IMD Column
         HD 1.6:          See Table 12.14 IMD & ILD Column
13. Required IMD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.3:          See Table 12.12 IMD & ILD Column
         HD 1.4:          See Table 12.13 Applicable AGS IMD Column
         HD 1.6:          See Table 12.14 IMD & ILD Column
14. Required ILD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.3:          See Table 12.12 IMD & ILD Column
         HD 1.4:          See Table 12.13 ILD Column
         HD 1.6:          See Table 12.14 IMD & ILD Column
15. Required IBD or PTRD separation is as follows:
         HD 1.3:          See Table 12.12 IBD & PTRD Column
         HD 1.4:          See Table 12.13 IBD & PTRD Column
         HD 1.6:          See Table 12.14 IBD & PTRD Column
16. If required by the MAJCOM, for aircraft survivability apply IBD/PTRD separation is as
follows:
         HD 1.3:          See Table 12.12 IBD & PTRD Column
         HD 1.4:          See Table 12.13 IBD & PTRD Column
         HD 1.6:          See Table 12.14 IBD & PTRD Column
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    299


17. When required at overseas locations only, use 125 ft for HD 1.3. The use of this reduced
separation depends on operational necessity, providing the commander accepts the transient risk
to military aircraft movements. If siting facilities, the MAJCOM/CC or CV must provide
AFSC/SEW a letter listing all installations at which this separation distance will apply and state
acceptance of transient risk to military aircraft movements.
18. IMD per note 13 as a minimum unless the MAJCOM requires aircraft survivability (apply
IBD/PTRD per Note 16 for aircraft survivability). See paragraph 12.47. 19. No QD separation
is required.
20. MAJCOMs will determine required QD separation.
21. MAJCOM may require aircraft survivability (apply IBD/PTRD per Note 16 for aircraft
survivability).
22. A HAS sited for HD 1.3 or 1.4 does not generate a QD clear zone except out the front.
23. HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.51.1. Sectors (front/side/rear)
of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21. The front sector of an HAS is considered unbarricaded
unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards. (See paragraph 12.51.)
24. See paragraph 12.40.
25. See paragraph 12.41.
26. See paragraph 12.42.
27. For HD 1.3 and HD 1.4, no separation is required from the side or rear of an ECM.

1. Ten units or more until the point is reached at which this distance is exceeded by the distance
requirements of Table 12.6.
2. More than 10 units may be involved before 1250 ft is exceeded. Consult AFSC for distances
involving more than 10 units.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                       301


3. When handling more than one missile, the missiles must be transported or handled in a nose-
to-tail configuration and in their launch capsule or shipping container; furthermore, they must be
aligned and/or handled so that each group of two missiles is located outside of the warhead
fragment beam spray region of the other two missiles.
4. Consult AFSC for distances involving more than 8 units.
5. PTRD is 60% of the resulting IBD. ILD / IMD will be based on NEWQD.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
A. Items identified by an asterisk ―*‖ include fragments from shipping or storage containers.
However, all of the HFD in this table may be applied to both packaged and unpackaged
configurations.

B. 105-mm projectiles and 105-mm complete rounds not in standard storage or shipping
containers are HD 1.1.

C. All models, including Advanced Capability (ADCAP).

D. These distances must be used when handling torpedo(es) from 2.5-ton trucks (or larger)
where sandbag (or other equivalent) shielding (as described in note (e) below) is not present
between the leading edge of the torpedo(es) warhead and the truck crew cab to prevent the crew
cab and windshield from contributing to the debris.

E. These distances may be used when handling torpedo(es) from:

1. 2.5-ton trucks (or larger) with sandbag (or other equivalent) shielding between the leading
edge of the torpedo(es) warhead and the truck crew cab to prevent the crew cab and windshield
from contributing to the debris.

2. Other means of transportation such as flatbed trailers, boats, torpedo transporters, forklifts, or
portable cranes.

(NOTE: Sandbag shield requirement is equivalent to a minimum thickness of 2 ft of sand
between the truck crew cab and the torpedo(es). The sandbags must shield all parts of the crew
cab and windshield from the torpedo warhead.)

F. Handling is limited to one launch tube at a time, with other tubes closed; risks associated with
possible propagation from the Tomahawk being handled to all other ammunition and explosives
in the SSGN as well as to ammunition and explosives in nearby combatant ships/boats must be
assumed by the Navy under an appropriate deviation from these Standards. (If handling is not
limited to one launch tube at a time, with other tubes closed, the NEW of the full SSGN load will
apply for siting IAW with this Standard.) The reduced QD arc shall be drawn from the tube.
(Pier-side staging areas must still be sited, however, the reduced QD in this table for Tomahawk
missiles may be used provided the restrictions of Note 3 are applied.)

3. For less than 50 lbs, less distance may be used when structures, blast mats, and the like can
completely contain fragments and debris. This table is not applicable when blast, fragments, and
debris are completely confined, as in certain test firing barricades. Note: UFC 3-340-02,
Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, may be used to prove complete
confinement of blast, fragments, and debris. Continue using K18 without a minimum distance
for specific situations having approved guidance such as Reduced MCEs for F-15/F-16 Aircraft
and the 15 Jan 2003 SDW memo.

4. Quantities above 500,000 lbs NEWQD are authorized only for HD 1.1 energetic liquids.

                                      Notes for Table 12.13

1. HD 1.4 AE may be stored in a general supplies warehouse area rather than in an AE storage
area. When storing in a general supplies warehouse area, any weatherproof warehouse structure
may serve as an HD 1.4 magazine. Such a structure will be separated from all other warehouses
per the AGS (L) IMD column of this table.

2. See subparagraph 12.7.1.1. for the applicability of HD 1.4 QD criteria and the determination
of NEWQD when HD 1.4 and other HD AE are located in the same site.

3. IBD and PTRD are 50ft from the sides and rear of an ECM. IBD and PTRD are 50 ft from an
AGS (H), an AGS (H/R), and an ECM front that meets the definition of AGS (H) as defined in
the legend for Table 12.2.; doors and other openings shall be barricaded IAW section 6E, or the
IBD or PTRD column of this table applied from them.

4. ILD is 0 ft from the sides and rear of an ECM. ILD is 0 ft from an AGS (H), an AGS (H/R),
and an ECM front that meets the definition of AGS (H) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2.;
doors and other openings shall be barricaded IAW section 6E, or the ILD column of this table
applied from these doors and openings.

5. Magazines storing only HD 1.4 AE may be located at these IM or IL distances from all other
magazines or operating locations regardless of the HD or NEWQD authorized in those adjacent
structures. Because the HD 1.4 AE may be destroyed as the result of an accident involving the
assets in those adjacent structures, the responsible commander must accept the potential loss of
the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure. The commander’s risk acceptance must be
documented by letter (i.e., signed by the commander stating he/she understands and accepts the
potential loss of the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure in the event of a mishap in an
adjacent explosives facility) and submitted as part of the explosives site plan. A new risk
acceptance letter is not required when a new adjacent explosives facility is sited, as long as the
original letter documented that other such structures might be added in the future.

6. Applies to all AGS (L) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2.

7. Applies to all AGS (H) and AGS (H/R) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2. Doors and
other openings shall be barricaded IA W section 6E, or the AGS (L) IMD column of this table
applied to and from these doors and openings.

8. HD 1.4S may be stored (including associated handling) without regard to QD criteria (see
paragraphs 12.29.3 and 2.23). Additionally, for reasons of operational necessity, limited
quantities of HD 1.4 AE (e.g., small arms AE and riot control munitions) may be stored within
facilities (e.g., hangars, arms rooms, and operating buildings) without regard to QD. See chapter
11 for storage and operations involving limited quantities of HD 1.4.

9. There is no upper limit on the NEWQD specifically required for safety reasons.
 312                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


10. Use the smaller distance when the ES is of non-combustible construction. Treat combat
aircraft and explosives-loaded cargo aircraft as non-combustible structures.

11. Apply the appropriate AGS column of this table based on whether the ECM front meets the
definition of AGS (L) or AGS (H), as defined in the legend for Table 12.2.

12. ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.4 provided they meet separation
requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other exposures
comply with applicable QD criteria.

1. When specifically approved by AFSC/SEW, for HD 1.6 AE packed in non-flammable pallets
or packing and stored in an ECM, the following QD apply, unless a lesser distance is permitted
by this table for aboveground sites (Note: These lesser distances can be applied to ECM
storage):
                DIBD,PTRD = 100 ft
                DILD = 50 ft
                DIMD = no specific requirement
2. Single round distance for airblast applies as a minimum; D in ft, NEWQD in lbs.
                DIBD,PTRD = 40W1/3 based on the NEWQD for a single round of AE
                DIMD, ILD = 18W1/3 based on the NEWQD for a single round of AE
3. D in ft, NEWQD in lbs
                DIBD,PTRD = 8W1/3
                NEWQD = DIBD,PTRD3/512
4. D in ft, NEWQD in lbs
                DIMD, ILD = 5W/3
                NEWQD = DIMD, ILD3/125
5. For quantities less than 100 lbs, the required distances are those specified for 100 lbs. The
use of lesser distances may be approved when supported by test data and/or analyses.

                                       Notes for Table 12.15

1. Flammable or combustible liquid classification index based on flash point and boiling point
versus criteria as specified in 29 CFR 1910.106 (OSHA) and NFPA 30 Flammable and
Combustible Liquids Code. Primary descriptor is a Roman numeral, possibly with an additional
letter.
2. NFPA oxidizer classification index as described in NFPA 430 Code for the Storage of Liquid
and Solid Oxidizers. Descriptor is an ordinary number.
3. Positive measures for spill containment/control will be taken for isolated storage of energetic
liquids in accordance with applicable OSHA and NFPA guidance (referenced in Tables 12.18
through 12.20). For flammable energetic liquids and liquid oxidizers where only minimum blast
or fragment distances are specified, applicable OSHA and/or NFPA guidance referenced in
Tables 12.18 and 12.19, respectively, should also be used.
4. Hydrogen peroxide solutions of concentration greater than 91% are NFPA Class 4 oxidizers.
 314                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


5. Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is
packaged in small (non-bulk) shipping containers, portable ground support equipment, small
aerospace flight vehicle propellant tanks, or similar pressure vessels that provide heavy
confinement (burst pressure greater than 100 psi).

6. Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is
packaged in small (non-bulk) shipping containers (DOT 5C or equivalent), portable ground
support equipment, small aerospace flight vehicle propellant tanks, or similar pressure vessels
providing a lower level of confinement (burst pressure less than or equal to 100 psi and if
adequate protection from fragments is not provided from terrain, effective barricades, nets, or
other physical means (lightweight building construction is not adequate). If protection from
fragments is provided, use the IBD/PTRD "Protected" column of Table 12.21.
7. For large ready, bulk, or rest storage tanks (as defined in paragraphs 12.36.7, 12.36.9, and
12.36.10), use Table 12.21.
8. Where there is a reasonable risk of vapor cloud explosion of large quantities (for example, in
bulk tank storage).
9. Technical grade nitromethane in unit quantities of 55 gallons or less in DOT approved
containers listed in 49CFR173.202 may be stored as flammable liquids (Table 12.18) provided
the following apply:
        a.      Packages are stored only one tier high.
        b.      Packages are protected from direct rays of sun.
        c.      Maximum storage life of two years, unless storage life tests indicate product
continues to meet purchase specification. Such tests are to be repeated at one-year intervals
thereafter.
10. For underwater static test stands, when operated at hydrostatic pressure above 50 psig, or for
propellant tanks or other vessels having burst pressures of greater than 100 psig without
acceptable pressure relief devices (unless otherwise hazard classified). For underwater test
stands, the TNT equivalence (MCE) should include the total energetic liquids weight in all
pumps and plumbing, as well as the weight of energetic liquids held in tankage (under the test
cell hydrostatic pressure) unless acceptable mitigation measures such as fuel line detonation
arrestors and/or fuel tank isolation/barricading are used (as determined by hazard analysis).
11. Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is
packaged in small vehicle propellant tanks, small (non-bulk) shipping containers, portable
ground support equipment, or similar pressure vessels that provide relatively heavy confinement
(burst pressure between 50 – 100 psig) without acceptable pressure relief devices.

1. The percentage factors given in the table are to be used to determine equivalencies of
energetic liquids mixtures at static test stands and range launch pads when such energetic liquids
are located aboveground and are unconfined except for their tankage. Other configurations will
be considered on an individual basis to determine equivalencies.
2. The explosives equivalent weight calculated by the use of this table will be added to any non-
nuclear explosive weight aboard before distances can be determined from Tables 12.6 and 12.8.
3. These equivalencies apply also for the following substitutions:
                Alcohols or other hydrocarbons for RP-1.
H2O2 for LO2 (only when LO2 is in combination with RP-1 or equivalent hydrocarbon fuel).
                MMH for N2H4, UDMH, or combinations of the two.
4. For quantities of energetic liquids up to but not over the equivalent of 100 lbs of AE, the
distance will be determined on an individual basis by AFSC. All personnel and facilities,
whether involved in the operation or not, will be protected by operating procedures, equipment
design, shielding, barricading, or other suitable means.
5. Distances less than intraline are not specified. Where a number of prepackaged energetic
liquid units are stored together, separation distance to other storage facilities will be determined
 316                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


on an individual basis by AFSC, taking into consideration normal hazard classification
procedures.
6. For siting launch vehicles and static test stands, explosive equivalent weight is the larger of:
                (a) The weight equal to 8W 2/3 where W is the weight of LO2/LH2; or
                (b) 14 percent of the LO2/LH2 weight.
(Note: For these calculations, use the total weight of LO2/LH2 present in the launch vehicle, or
the total weight in test stand run tankage and piping for which there is no positive means to
prevent mixing in credible mishaps. When it can be reliably demonstrated that the MCE
involves a lesser quantity of energetic liquids subject to involvement in a single reaction, the
lesser quantity may be used in determining the explosive equivalent yield. When siting is based
on a quantity less than the total energetic liquids present, the MCE and associated explosive yield
analysis must be documented in an approved site plan (see Chapter 14).)
7. These are hypergolic combinations.
8. Explosive equivalency of the hybrid rocket system N2O4 liquid oxidizer combined with
PBAN (polybutadiene-acrylic acid-acronitrile) solid fuel was evaluated as 15 percent for an
explosive donor accident scenario, 5 percent for a high velocity impact scenario, and less than
0.01 percent (negligible) for static mixing (tower drop) failures in accordance with NFPA 251,
Standard Methods of Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and Materials.

1. Other guidelines for diking, tank or container construction, tank venting, and facility
construction apply (except for Class III B combustible liquids, e.g. Otto Fuel II). Refer to NFPA
30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid
and Solid Oxidizers for further guidance on liquid storage and fire protection.
2. Refer to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 30, Flammable and
Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers
for definition and explanation of OSHA/NFPA classification of flammable and combustible
liquids.
3. Guidelines on interior storage configuration (for container storage inside buildings) also apply
with the following exceptions:
(a) If the storage building is located at least 100 ft fom any exposed building (under the direct
jurisdiction of a fire protection organization) or property line; or
(b) If the storage building is located at least 200 ft from any exposed building (not under the
direct jurisdiction of a fire protection organization) or property line; or
(c) for combustible liquids that will not exhibit sustained burning in bulk form, e.g. Otto Fuel II,
as determined through ASTM D 92 Standard Test Method for Flash and Fire Points by
Cleveland Open Cup or comparable testing. Refer to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    317


Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for further
guidance on liquid storage and fire protection.
4. For container storage inside of a building, IBD/PTR distances may be less than 50 ft (to a
minimum of 10 ft) if the storage building is constructed of fire resistive exterior walls having an
NFPA Fire Resistance rating of two hours or more according to NFPA 251, Standard Methods of
Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and Materials.
5. For large tank storage, QD may be 25 ft for tank capacities up to 100,000 gallons, and 37.5 ft
for capacities between 100,001 and 500,000 gallons.
6. For flammable liquids container storage inside of a building, ILD/Aboveground IMD is 50 ft
(except as in Note 4), or for adjacent incompatible oxidizer storage, distances specified for
energetic liquid oxidizers (Table 12.19) or oxygen (Table 12.20). For flammable liquids storage
in fixed or large portable tanks, ILD/Aboveground IMD is either (1) for compatible energetic
liquids, equal to one sixth of the sum of the diameters of the two adjacent tanks, or distances
specified in Note 5 for adjacent container storage inside of a building; or (2) for adjacent
incompatible oxidizer storage, distances specified for energetic liquid oxidizers (Table 12.19) or
oxygen (Table 12.20). ECM may be used to their physical capacity for storing flammable
energetic liquids provided they comply with the construction and siting requirements of Chapter
6 and Chapter 12, respectively for Hazard Division 1.1. ECM must be sited for a minimum of
100 lbs of HD 1.1 items using Tables 12.7 and 12.1.

1. QD requirements do not apply to the storage of NFPA Class 2 and 3 oxidizers when all
requirements of NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers, have been met.
2. Other requirements for interior storage configuration, building construction, diking, container
materials, facility venting, etc. also apply. Refer to NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid
and Solid Oxidizers for further guidance on oxidizer storage and fire protection.
3. Refer to NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for definition and
explanation of NFPA classification of oxidizers.
4. Multiple tanks containing NFPA Class 4 oxidizers may be located at distances less than those
specified in the table; however, if the tanks are not separated from each other by 10 percent of
the distance specified for the largest tank, then the total contents of all tanks will be used to
calculate distances to other exposures.
5. The equations given below may be used to determine distance/weights for other quantities:
        Quantity (W) in lbs, distance in ft
        W  10,000 lbs:         Distance = 149.3 x W(-0.41+0.059*ln(W))
        W > 10,000 lbs:         Distance = 24 x W1/3
                                  Notes for Table 12.19 (continued)

       Distance > 75 ft:
       W = exp[-134.286 + 71.998 x (ln(Distance)) – 12.363 x (ln(Distance))2 + 0.7229 x
       (ln(Distance))3]

6. NFPA 430 requires sprinkler protection to be provided for storage of greater than 2,000 lbs of
NFPA Class 4 oxidizers inside of a building (NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and
Solid Oxidizers).

1. Per NFPA 251, Standard Methods of Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and
Materials, distances do not apply where a protective structure having an NFPA fire resistance
rating of at least two hours interrupts the line of sight between the oxygen system and the
exposure. Refer to Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910, Subpart H – Hazardous
Materials, current edition and NFPA 50, Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites
for further guidance.
2. Additional guidelines relating to equipment assembly and installation, facility design (diking),
and other fire protection issues also apply. Refer to Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, Part
1910, Subpart H – Hazardous Materials, current edition and NFPA 50, Standard for Bulk
Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites for further guidance.
3. QD is independent of oxygen quantity.

1. Positive measures will be taken to prevent mixing of hydrogen or hydrazine’s and adjacent
oxidizers in the event of a leak or spill.
2. Distances are necessary to provide reasonable protection from fragments of tanks or
equipment that are expected to be thrown in event of a vapor phase explosion.
3. W in lbs, Distance in ft
       W < 10,000 lbs: Unprotected Distance = 600 ft
       10,000 < W  265,000 lbs: Unprotected Distance = 28 x W1/3
       W > 265,000 lbs:        Unprotected Distance = 1,800 ft
       603 ft < Unprotected Distance < 1,798 ft: W = (Unprotected Distance/28)3
4. The term ―protected‖ means that protection from fragments is provided by terrain, effective
barricades, nets, or other physical means.

5. Distances are based on the recommended IBD given in DoD 4500.9-R (Part II, Cargo),
Defense Transportation Regulation, and extrapolation of the 2 cal/cm2 data on the 1 percent
water vapor curve. W in lbs, Distance in ft

       W < 100 lbs: Protected Distance = 80 ft
       100 lbs <W:
       Protected Distance = -154.1 + 72.89 x [ln(W)] – 6.675 x [ln(W)]2 + 0.369 x [ln(W)]3

        80 ft < Protected Distance:
        W = exp[311.367 – 215.761 x (ln(protected distance)) + 55.1828 x (ln(protected
        distance))2 – 6.1099 x (ln(protected distance))3 + 0.25343 x (ln(protected distance))4]
6. ILD/Aboveground IMD distances in this column apply for adjacent compatible (ELCG LB or
LC) storage; for adjacent incompatible (other ELCG) storage, use IBD distances shown in
previous columns. ECM may be used to their physical capacity for storing hydrogen provided
they comply with the construction and siting requirements of Chapters 6 and 12, respectively for
HD 1.1. ECM must be sited for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1 items using
Tables 12.7 and 12.1.
7. Distances are 37.5 percent of ―protected‖ column.
8. Extrapolations above 1,000,000 lbs extend well outside data included in Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 77, ―Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace,‖ current edition from
which the original QD tables were derived; however, they are supported by independent
calculations and knowledge of like phenomena.

1. Separations are based on First, Second, and Third Generation HAS doors remaining closed,
except for aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing
operations or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or
out of shelters. If doors are left open for extended periods, apply default IMD to or from an open
front. A HAS arch or rear wall may be considered as a barricade for application of K6. No
reduction from K11 is allowed between ―open door‖ HAS front to front exposures.

2. First Generation and Korean TAB VEE HAS are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,863
lbs. Second Generation, Third Generation, and Korean Flow-Through HAS are limited to a
maximum NEWQD of 11,000 lbs. HAS Ready Service ECMs/AGMs are limited to a maximum
NEWQD of 22,000 lbs.

3. HAS Pairs.
      a. Flow-Through HAS Pairs are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 4,800 lbs in each
      HAS. For this NEWQD, IM protection is provided between each HAS in a HAS Pair.
      IM protection between a HAS Pair and adjacent HAS and HAS Ready Service
      ECM/AGM shall be in accordance with this table for the HAS designs involved.

       b. HAS Pairs with rear walls or with front and rear walls are limited to a maximum
       NEWQD of 2,390 lbs in each HAS. For this NEWQD, IM protection is provided
       between each HAS in a HAS Pair. IM protection between a HAS Pair and adjacent HAS

                                          Notes for Table 12.25A

1. This table may be applied from the front, sides and rear of a Second Generation HAS, and
from the sides of a Korean Flow-Through HAS. Apply default QD criteria from the front and
rear of a Korean Flow-Through HAS.
2. Separations are based on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling,
servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when
maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters. If doors are left
open for extended periods, normal combat aircraft parking area (per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3)
apply from the front.
3. Separate AE from the HAS walls by a distance sufficient to prevent breaching. For less than
1,100 lbs NEWQD a 3 ft separation from the wall is sufficient.
4. The QD criteria apply to IBD, PTRD and ILD exposures for quantities < 1,100 lbs NEWQD.
5. The 50 ft distance shown is not for QD purposes, but represents a minimum fire separation
distance.
6. QD criterion applies to IBD, PTRD, and ILD exposures for quantities > 1,100 to 11,000 lbs
NEWQD. Use 50% of the IBD criteria for PTRD exposures with a 300 ft minimum out the front
and rear or a 394 ft minimum distance off the sides. Use 35% of the IBD criteria for intraline
exposures with a 300 ft minimum distance out the front and rear or 394 ft minimum distance off
the sides.

open for extended periods, normal combat aircraft parking area (per Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3)
apply from the front.
3. Separate AE from the HAS walls by a distance sufficient to prevent breaching. For less than
1,100 lbs NEWQD a 3 ft separation from the wall is sufficient.
4. These QD criteria apply to IBD, PTRD and ILD exposures for quantities < 586.3 lbs
NEWQD.
5. The 50 ft distance shown is not for QD purposes, but represents a minimum fire separation
distance.
6. QD criterion applies to IBD, PTRD, and ILD exposures for quantities > 586.3 to 5,863 lbs
NEWQD. Use 50% of the IBD criteria for PTRD exposures with a 300 ft minimum out the front
and rear or a 394 ft minimum distance off the sides. Use 35% of the IBD criteria for intraline
exposures with a 300 ft minimum distance out the front and rear or 394 ft minimum distance off

1. These calculated fragment throw distances are for individual munitions and do not apply to
stacks. They also do not address ―rogue‖ (non-case) fragments that can be produced from
sections of nose plugs, base plates, boattails, or lugs. Rogue fragments can travel to significantly
greater distances (i.e., >10,000 ft) than those shown. Care must be taken to properly orient the
munition or take other measures to minimize rogue fragment hazards.

2. Robust munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Diameter (D) in inches; ln is natural logarithm.

MFD = 711* D(0.91 – 0.073 * ln (D))
     D = exp[6.233 – {128.804 – 13.699 * ln (MFD)} 1/2 ]

3. Extremely Heavy case Munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Diameter (D) in inches; ln is natural logarithm.

MFD = 854.8 * D0.682
     D = (5.0243E -05) * MFD1.4663

4. Non-Robust munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Diameter (D) in inches; ln is natural logarithm.

MFD = 840 * D(0.645 – 0.07 * ln (D))
     D = exp[4.607 – {117.417 – 14.286 * ln (MFD)} 1/2 ]

5. Use of equations given in notes (2), (3), and (4) to determine other Diameter/MFD
combinations is allowed.

6. See subparagraph 12.74.3.2.2.2. for ranges associated with multiple munitions detonation.

1. These calculated fragment throw distances are for individual munitions and do not apply to
stacks. They also do not address ―rogue‖ (non-case) fragments that can be produced from
sections of nose plugs, base plates, boattails, or lugs. Rogue fragments can travel to significantly
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    333


greater distances (i.e., >10,000 ft) than those shown. Care must be taken to properly orient the
munition or take other measures to minimize rogue fragment hazards.

2. Robust munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Net Explosive Weight (W) in pounds; ln is natural
logarithm.

MFD = 2404 + 394.5 * ln (W)
     W = exp[(MFD – 2404) /394.5]

3. Extremely Heavy Case Munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Net Explosive Weight (W) in pounds; ln is natural
logarithm.

MFD = 2756 + 565.9 * ln (W)
     W = exp[(MFD – 2756) / 565.9]

4. Non-Robust munitions are defined in the glossary.

Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) in ft, Net Explosive Weight (W) in pounds; ln is natural
logarithm.

       MFD = 1561.3 + 191.8 * ln (W) (100 ft minimum)
       W = exp[(MFD – 1561.3) / 191.8]

5. Use of equations given in notes (2), (3), and (4) to determine other W/MFD combinations is
allowed.

6. See subparagraph 12.74.3.2.2.2. for ranges associated with multiple munitions detonation.

                                           Chapter 13

       CONTINGENCIES, COMBAT OPERATIONS, MILITARY OPERATIONS

Section 13A—Introduction

13.1. Introduction. Per Joint Publication 1-02, contingencies are emergencies involving
military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or by required military
operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies require plans, rapid response,
and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations, and
equipment. This chapter provides the optional criteria for contingencies, combat operations,
military operations other than war (MOOTW), and associated training. Full compliance with
other chapters of this Manual may not be possible during such operations. In situations
involving combined or joint operations, the Commander of Unified or Specified Command
(Combatant Commander) or the US Commander of a Joint Task Force (JTF) will designate the
Service explosives safety criteria to be used.
13.2. Scope. The provisions of this chapter only apply to:
   13.2.1. Those Air Force AE activities located outside the United States.
   13.2.2. Combatant Commanders, United States Commanders of JTF or Air Force
   Commanders in the management of these Air Force AE activities. When necessary,
   commanders may delegate certain explosive safety responsibilities to designated subordinate
   commanders to ensure appropriate controls.
   13.2.3. Contingency, combat, and MOOTW training, regardless of location, when
   specifically authorized by applicable Air Force headquarters or Unified Command
   Commander. Prior to approval of this training, a risk analysis that thoroughly assesses asset
   preservation and identifies the risk associated with the training will be conducted. QD
   separations provided for asset preservation will be used for training, except where Chapter 12
   permits lesser distances to be used.
13.3. Contingencies,       Combat        Operations,         MOOTW,           and       Associated
Training. Contingency, combat operations and MOOTW refer to operations that a unit actually
conducts during or leading up to a contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation. These operations
may actually occur as previously defined by the operational plan, may be modified from the
operational plan, or may be newly defined if an operational plan did not exist prior to the
contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation. Associated training refers to training occurring in
the immediate support of an impending or on-going contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation
(e.g., UTC training in support of AEF rotation or tasking); routine training falls under day-to-day
operations per paragraph 1.2.1.6.1.
13.4. Asset Preservation and Minimum Separation Distances. This chapter provides
optional criteria and risk management tools not available elsewhere in this Manual. These
optional criteria provide greater protection (asset preservation distance) for assets deemed
sufficiently critical to warrant the greater protection, and, in some circumstances, provide lesser
protection (minimum separation distance) for those assets for which the mission requirements
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  337


outweigh the increased risk to those assets. See chapter 12 for paired relationships not covered
in this section.
   13.4.1. Asset preservation distance. At this distance from the PES, assets at the ES are
   expected to be usable and mission capability is maintained following an incident. This
   separation distance should prevent propagation between PES. (See DoD 6055.09-M, DoD
   Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, for expected consequences for these separation
   distances.)
   13.4.2. Minimum separation distance. At this distance from the PES, mission capability
   will likely be impaired or delayed. This separation distance should prevent prompt
   propagation; however, late time propagation between PES is possible. (See DoD 6055.09-M,
   DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, for expected consequences for these
   separation distances.)

Section 13B—Planning for Deployments

13.5. Planning for Deployments.
   13.5.1. The requirements of this Manual also apply to contingencies, peacetime
   deployments, and exercises where explosives are involved. At no time is the observance of
   explosives safety practices more important than when deploying or employing combat forces.
   Explosives safety is an integral part of combat survivability.
   13.5.2. Pay careful attention during planning to ensure compliance with explosives QD rules
   as discussed in Annex FF of the Air Force War Mobilization Plan Vol. 1 (WMP1).
   13.5.3. MAJCOMs which have units that deploy or support deployed forces will require
   these units to develop procedures and explosives site plans for parking explosives-loaded
   aircraft, as well as receipt, storage, buildup, and delivery of munitions. Explosives safety
   considerations must be an integral part of the site survey team’s visit and subsequent plans
   for on-going support and oversight. These procedures and explosives site plans are
   developed jointly by operations, civil engineering, logistics, and safety from both augmented
   and augmenting MAJCOMs and units. MAJCOMs will make these procedures and
   explosives site plans available to deploying units.
   13.5.4. Planning for possible deployments includes:
       13.5.4.1. A review of waivers and exemptions that may impact deployment plans, such
       as those in Attachment 4.
       13.5.4.2. Periodic updates as munitions commitments and bed-down locations change.
       Include civil engineering concept plans for constructing required aircraft revetments or
       protective shelters and munitions storage facilities. For units with a munitions mission
       but no specific deployment location, site preplanning must be adaptable to any
       deployment location.
       13.5.4.3. Locally written instructions (see Section 7B) for all phases of munitions
       operations at the deployed location.
       13.5.4.4. Briefings to tasked unit personnel on the plans and procedures to be used at the
       deployment location.
 338                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   13.5.5. MAJCOMs must ensure adequate explosives safety support is available at the
   deployment location during planning and bed-down.
   13.5.6. The QD priority to maintain during planning and employment of combat forces is:
   (1) maintaining intermagazine (IM) separation, (2) meeting intraline (IL) separation, and (3)
   protecting unrelated personnel.
   13.5.7. See Chapter 14 and Section 13D for explosives site planning requirements. (See Air
   Force Pamphlet 91-216, USAF Safety Deployment and Contingency Pamphlet.)

Section 13C—Risk Management

13.6. Risk Management. Consistent with operational requirements, it is Air Force policy to
manage risks associated with AE (see paragraph 1.1). Exceptions to this chapter’s criteria are
allowed only where equivalent protection is provided, or where risk assessment and risk
management control is performed.
   13.6.1. Equivalent Protection. Situations where an analysis determines that protective
   construction or other specialized safety features provide a level of protection equivalent to
   the separation distances required by this Manual.
   13.6.2. Risk Assessment. Situations where an assessment determines that an acceptable
   level of safety is provided. Risk assessment (see Chapter 4) is a systematic procedure
   consisting of the following four steps:
       13.6.2.1. An event analysis to identify and describe possible events such as the location,
       type of occurrence, probability of occurrence, and quantity of explosives.
       13.6.2.2. An effects analysis of the effects of the possible events to persons in the
       surroundings such as blast pressure, fragmentation, and thermal hazards.
       13.6.2.3. An exposure analysis of the places, protection and time history of exposed
       personnel in the hazardous areas.
       13.6.2.4. A risk calculation.
   13.6.3. Risk Management Control. The action a commander takes to minimize acceptable
   risk. Such actions will include:
       13.6.3.1. Development, implementation, and enforcement of applicable control measures
       used to eliminate the hazard or reduce its risk.
       13.6.3.2. Continuous evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented control
       measures.

Section 13D—Explosives Site Planning

13.7. Site Approval. All explosives locations falling within the scope of this chapter will be
approved by the applicable commander or by the DDESB per paragraph 13.8. Site approval
documentation will be submitted:
   13.7.1. For AE locations such as the following:
       13.7.1.1. Storage locations.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                339


       13.7.1.2. Holding areas (e.g., basic load ammunition holding areas (BLAHA), flight line
       holding areas, port and railhead holding areas, and marshalling areas, etc.).
       13.7.1.3. Handling and operating locations (e.g., HAS, ports, AE maintenance, repair,
       and renovation areas and sling out areas, etc.).
       13.7.1.4. Forward arming and refueling points (FARP).
       13.7.1.5. Combat aircraft parking area (CAPA) and cargo aircraft parking areas.
       13.7.1.6. Static missile batteries.
       13.7.1.7. Locations used for the treatment or disposal (e.g., open burn or open
       detonation) of munitions. Exceptions are those locations used in an emergency response,
       for burning excess propellant resulting from munitions use during training, and those
       involved in direct combat operations.
   13.7.2. For non-AE exposed sites within quantity-distance (QD) arcs.
13.8. Site Approval and Documentation Requirements. The operational situation and the
type and duration of the AE operations conducted at the site or facility determine the type of
documentation required for a site approval and the approval level. The following categories of
operations apply:
   13.8.1. Permanent.
       13.8.1.1. Definition. Those AE related facilities where operations are expected to
       continue for more than 12 months.
       13.8.1.2. Documentation and Approval Requirements. A DDESB approved
       explosives site plan for such locations must be obtained once the Combatant Commander
       (or Air Force headquarters where applicable) determines operations will require the
       facilities’ use to exceed 12 months. Explosives site plans with waivers or exemptions
       will be processed in accordance with the ―day-to-day operations‖ requirements of Section
       1B.
   13.8.2. Recurrent.
       13.8.2.1. Definition. Those AE related facilities where operations are expected to occur
       on a periodic basis regardless of the duration of the operation. These locations may be
       sited using compensatory actions, such as facility evacuation or change-of-use, to
       minimize the risks associated with AE operations.
       13.8.2.2. Documentation and Approval Requirements. These locations must have a
       DDESB (or appropriate level of command when applicable) approved explosives site
       plan before commencing operations. Explosives site plans with waivers or exemptions
       will be processed in accordance with the ―day-to-day operations‖ requirements of Section
       1B.
   13.8.3. Temporary.
       13.8.3.1. Definition. Those AE related facilities where operations are not expected to
       continue for more than 12 months and are not recurrent, or for which advanced planning
       and approval are impractical.
 340                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       13.8.3.2. Documentation and Approval Requirements. A plan for the specific
       scenario will be approved by the applicable commander. The plan will detail the
       following:
          13.8.3.2.1. A risk assessment for the proposed operation. This assessment will
          weigh the need for the facility against the potential effects of a mishap (e.g., mission
          impact, loss of resources, turnaround times, etc.).
          13.8.3.2.2. Schedule for the cessation of explosives operations or submittal of an
          explosives site plan per paragraph 13.8.1 if the operations exceed 12 months.
   13.8.4. Contingency, Combat, and MOOTW Training.
       13.8.4.1. Definition. Those operations that simulate real world combat environments
       using live AE to achieve training goals and occur in the immediate support of an
       impending or on-going contingency, combat, or MOOTW situation.
       13.8.4.2. Documentation and Approval Requirements. Facilities or areas for training
       activities will have a DDESB approved explosives site plan for permanent or recurrent
       operations, or a risk analysis approved by the applicable commander for temporary
       operations. For permanent or recurrent operations, explosives site plans with waivers or
       exemptions will be processed in accordance with the ―day-to-day operations‖
       requirements of Section 1B.
13.9. Explosives Site Plan Packages. See Chapter 14 for explosives site plan requirements
with the following changes:
   13.9.1. In the absence of suitable maps or drawings, information (e.g., sketches,
   photographs, or other information) may be provided.
   13.9.2. An explanation of any deviations from pertinent safety standard caused by local
   conditions.
   13.9.3. A copy of the risk analysis performed, if one was performed, to demonstrate
   equivalent protection.
13.10. Approval Authority for Exceptions. The Combatant Commander, United States
Commander of a JTF or Air Force Component Commander, for strategic or other compelling
reasons may authorize exceptions to the explosives safety standards herein for the planning or
conduct of temporary contingencies, combat operations and MOOTW. All exceptions will be
coordinated with the host nation, as required, and consistent with international agreements.
   13.10.1. Requests for exceptions to QD criteria will be per Air Force directives. When joint
   operations are being conducted from a single base or location, exceptions that affect another
   Service must be coordinated with that Service.
   13.10.2. Requests for exceptions to QD criteria will contain the following:
       13.10.2.1. A risk analysis for the proposed operation weighing the need to conduct the
       operation and violate the standards against the potential effect of a mishap (e.g., mission
       impact, loss of resources, turnaround times, etc.).
       13.10.2.2. A timeline listing milestones which will eliminate the need for the exception.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                              341


   13.10.3. For planned construction, in support of temporary contingency, combat operations
   or MOOTW, not meeting QD criteria, obtain Combatant Commander, United States
   Commander of JTF, or Air Force Component Commander approval.

Section 13E—QD Criteria for Contingencies, Combat Operations, MOOTW and Associated
Training

13.11. Basic Load Ammunition Holding Area (BLAHA).
   13.11.1. General. To fulfill their missions, certain units must keep their basic load
   ammunition in armored vehicles, trucks, trailers, structures, or on pads. This involves
   acceptance of greater risks to unit personnel, facilities, and equipment than permitted by
   other chapters of this Standard. The concept of BLAHA storage may also be used to provide
   QD separations during mobile operations. A Basic Load Storage Area (BLSA) is a location
   containing multiple BLAHA.
   13.11.2. Mixing of Basic Load Ammunition. Storage compatibility requirements of
   Chapter 7 do not apply to BLAHA facilities.
      13.11.2.1. NEWQD for use with BLAHA QD criteria will be determined as follows:
          13.11.2.1.1. The sum of the weights of all energetic compositions contained in
          munitions hazard classified as HD 1.1 or 1.5 will be used.
          13.11.2.1.2. The sum of the explosive weight of all HD 1.2 AE will be used. The
          propellant weight of a HD 1.2 item (if present) may be disregarded.
          13.11.2.1.3. The weights of energetic compositions hazard classified as HD 1.3 may
          be disregarded. However, if the site only contains HD 1.3 items, the criteria
          contained in paragraph 12.28 apply.
          13.11.2.1.4. The weights of energetic compositions classified as HD 1.4 may be
          disregarded.
          13.11.2.1.5. The explosive weight of HD 1.6 will be computed as follows:
             13.11.2.1.5.1. When HD 1.6 is stored alone or with HD 1.4 AE, the QD criteria
             of paragraphs 12.29. and 12.30. apply.
             13.11.2.1.5.2. When HD 1.6 is stored with AE classified as HD 1.1, HD 1.2 or
             HD 1.5, add the explosives weight of the HD 1.6 items into the NEWQD
             calculations.
             13.11.2.1.5.3. When HD 1.6 is stored with AE classified as HD 1.3 add the
             explosives weights of HD 1.3 and HD 1.6. The QD criteria in paragraph 12.28
             apply.
      13.11.2.2. Explosives Limits.
          13.11.2.2.1. The maximum NEWQD at any BLAHA in a BLSA storing mixed
          compatibility must not exceed 8,818 lbs. A BLSA may have multiple 8,818-lb
          BLAHA, provided the BLAHA are separated from each other by the applicable
          distances (D1, D2 and D3) given in Table 13.1.
 342                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


          13.11.2.2.2. When the NEWQD of a BLSA or a BLAHA exceeds 8,818 lb, the QD
          computations and HD mixing rules for the site will be per Chapter 12 and the
          explosives compatibility storage criteria will be per Chapter 7.
   13.11.3. QD Computations.
       13.11.3.1. The total NEWQD of AE in each site will be used for computation of QD
       provided the required distances (Table 13.1) necessary to prevent propagation separate
       these sites. If the separation distances are not met, the entire BLSA will be considered
       one site and paragraph 13.11.2.2.2 applies.
       13.11.3.2. The IMD requirements of Chapter 12 apply when using 3-bar or 7-bar ECM.
       13.11.3.3. Table 13.1 contains the QD separation for BLAHA and BLSA.
       13.11.3.4. Heavy armored vehicles are expected to contain most of the blast and
       fragments from an internal explosion and are well protected from an external explosion.
       For this reason there is no required separation from heavy armor PES to light or non-
       armored ES. Additionally, heavy armor ES require no separation from other sites. The
       hatches of heavy armored vehicles must be kept closed to be considered as heavy armor
       vehicles; otherwise, they are considered as light armor vehicles. Use Table 13.2 to
       determine the applicable QD for heavy, light and non- armored vehicles.
13.12. Ports. The following required separation criteria will apply to ports where DoD AE are
loaded or un-loaded.
   13.12.1. Explosives Piers.
       13.12.1.1. AGM IMD (K11) will be maintained between explosives piers.
       13.12.1.2. ILD (K18) will be maintained from an explosives pier to a non-explosives pier
       used for the handling of military cargo.
       13.12.1.3. AGM IMD (K11) will be maintained to AE holding areas (HA) based on the
       NEWQD at the pier.
       13.12.1.4. Marshalling Yards will be located at PTRD from explosives piers.
       13.12.1.5. Railheads used for long-term storage or as a transfer depot will be sited at
       AGM IMD (K11) from an explosives pier based on the NEWQD at the pier.
   13.12.2. Explosives Anchorages. The criteria of DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 4, DoD
   Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, apply with the following exceptions:
       13.12.2.1. ILD (K18) will be provided between the explosives loading or unloading
       section of the anchorage and the loaded ship section of the explosives anchorage.
       13.12.2.2. An explosives anchorage will be located at K40 from all piers. However,
       where necessary for security or navigational reasons, this distance may be reduced to ILD
       (K18) when the piers are only used for DoD operations. PTRD may be applied for asset
       preservation. A separation distance of K40 will be maintained to all non-DoD related
       piers.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   343


       13.12.2.3. ILD (K18) is permitted between an explosives anchorage and a non-
       explosives DoD related anchorage. K40 will be maintained between an explosives
       anchorage and a non-explosives, non-DoD related anchorage.
   13.12.3. Explosives Facilities.
       13.12.3.1. AE HA. These HA are used in support of AE loading and un-loading of
       ships. Typically, AE being held at these locations are only present for a short time. The
       NEWQD associated with the AE HA is based on all AE present at the site. The
       following apply to AE HA:
          13.12.3.1.1. ILD (K18) will be maintained to both explosives and non-explosives
          piers based on the NEWQD present at the AE HA.
          13.12.3.1.2. PTRD will be maintained to an explosives or non-explosives
          Marshalling Yard.
          13.12.3.1.3. Railheads used for AE HA storage or as a transfer depot will be sited at
          AGM IMD (K11) from an AE HA based on the NEWQD at the AE HA.
       13.12.3.2. Marshalling Yards. PTRD will be maintained between marshalling yards and
       explosives piers or AE HA. The location of the marshalling yard will typically be
       governed by the NEWQD at the other PES. When operational necessity dictates,
       marshalling yards may be separated by ILD (K18) to any nearby manned explosives
       operations and AGM IMD (K11) to any nearby unmanned explosives storage operations.
       13.12.3.3. Loading Docks. Loading docks will be sited at IMD (K11) from all ES.
       13.12.3.4. Classification Yards. Use criteria provided in paragraph 12.61.
       13.12.3.5. Railheads. Based on its use, a railhead will be sited as a classification yard,
       AE HA or a loading dock.
13.13. Field Storage and Handling Areas. These areas will be sited per Table 13.3. Use
separation distances from the applicable QD tables in Chapter 12 for the HD and NEWQD of the
AE involved with the PES. AE will be segregated per Chapter 7 by storage CG. The clear zone
surrounding the field storage and handling areas is bounded by the applicable IBD. No
unrelated, occupied structures are permitted within this zone.
   13.13.1. These areas may consist of all or some of the following explosives locations:
       13.13.1.1. Field Storage . These sections are used to store AE. The reason for using
       field storage sections is to disperse the AE in multiple, widely separated storage sections
       to prevent the loss of any one section from causing the loss of other sections thereby
       seriously degrading the mission. AE may be stored in existing structures per Chapter 12,
       and caves or tunnels as prescribed in DoD 6055.09-M, DoD Ammunition and Explosives
       Safety Standards. The construction and use of barricades and revetments will be per
       Chapter 6.
       13.13.1.2. AE Staging Area. These areas are normally used as an HA for outgoing AE
       and for ready access to combat aircraft loading areas (CALA).
 344                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       13.13.1.3. Captured Enemy Ammunition Area. A separate area will be provided for
       the storage of captured enemy AE. Captured enemy AE that cannot be identified will be
       treated as HD 1.1.
       13.13.1.4. AE Operations Area. An area used for operations such as minor
       maintenance and repair of AE or their containers, surveillance, segregation, or weapons
       assembly.
       13.13.1.5. AE Destruction Area. An area used for the destruction of AE. It may
       consist of a burning area, a demolition area, or both.
       13.13.1.6. Sling-out Area. An area used for the movement of AE by rotary wing
       aircraft.
   13.13.2. These areas may consist of all or some of the following non-explosives locations:
       13.13.2.1. Administration and Billeting Areas. Inhabited locations not directly related
       to the daily operations of the field storage and handling areas.
       13.13.2.2. Manned Support Facilities. Facilities that directly support AE operations
       (e.g., field offices and AE support equipment maintenance facilities).
       13.13.2.3. Unmanned Support Facilities. Unmanned locations that support AE
       operations (e.g., forklift charging stations, dunnage storage, and buildings that store inert
       materials). A minimum 50 ft separation distance will be maintained from these locations
       to any PES.
   13.13.3. Modular Storage. A barricaded area comprised of a series of connected cells with
   hard surface storage pads separated from each other by barricades (see Section 6D).
   13.13.4. Commercial Intermodal Containers (CIC). Containers used for transporting AE
   may be used for AE storage and will be sited as AGM.
13.14. Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP). The storage of AE and fuel at the
same location is inherently hazardous and shall be avoided when possible. If it is necessary to
refuel and rearm aircraft at the same location, all precautions must be made to minimize the
hazards involved in these operations. Armament pads will contain the minimum amount of AE
to conduct efficient operations. For example, where armament pads support only one aircraft,
that pad will be restricted to the amount of ammunition necessary to rearm that aircraft. The
following required separation criteria apply:
   13.14.1. Use K24 for asset preservation between FARP and other ES.
   13.14.2. FARPs will be separated by IBD from all non-associated inhabited buildings.
   13.14.3. AE ready storage (i.e., AE staged to support the next load) will be separated by
   AGM IMD from the armament pads with only armament pads considered as the PES. Ready
   AE storage structures and locations will be separated from other ready AE storage structures
   and locations by AGM IMD.
   13.14.4. Build-up locations will be separated by AGM IMD from all other explosives
   storage and operations with only the build-up locations considered as the PES.
   13.14.5. Distances prescribed by the owning service will separate other support structures
   and sites.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   345


   13.14.6. AE will be separated from operational fuel supplies by at least 100 ft. Fuel supplies
   will be diked or placed downhill from AE.
13.15. Airfield Operations. Special consideration must be given to phased plans where the
peacetime operation and positioning of aircraft transitions to contingency operations with
increased quantities and use of AE. Exposures given adequate protection under the peacetime
phase may be at greater risk during the contingency phase. Commanders must consider these
changes when approving these plans. The proper use of such features as barricades or earth-
filled, steel-bin-type barricades (ARMCO revetment or equivalent per Section 6E) can decrease
the magnitude of a potential event and increase the explosives capacity of limited areas.
   13.15.1. Airfield QD Criteria for PES. Table 13.4 provides criteria for airfield PES.
   13.15.2. Airfield QD Criteria for ES.
       13.15.2.1. Runways, Taxiways and Aircraft.
          13.15.2.1.1. For military use only, use Table 13.4.
          13.15.2.1.2. For joint use, use criteria in Tables 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.
   13.15.2.2. Combat Aircraft Support Facilities.
          13.15.2.2.1. Unhardened combat aircraft support facilities will be separated from AE
          storage and operating facilities by K30 for HD 1.1 and PTRD for all other HDs. For
          asset preservation, apply IBD with no minimum fragment distance based on the
          NEWQD for HD 1.1; apply IBD for all other HDs.
          13.15.2.2.2. If these functions are located in a HAS, separation may be reduced to
          K18 to the sides or rear of the HAS.
          13.15.2.2.3. Other hardened facility sitings require DDESB approval.
          13.15.2.2.4. When operational necessity dictates, separation distances less than K18
          may be approved for ES; however, it must be demonstrated that protection equivalent
          to K18 is being provided.
13.16. Static Missile Battery Separation. To ensure optimal effectiveness, offensive and
defensive missile batteries many times must be deployed in a static (non-mobile role) in the
proximity of other AE operations such as field storage or flight lines. The following criteria
apply to deployed static missile batteries and associated support functions.
   13.16.1. IMD (K11) will be maintained between missile launchers, reloads and other AE
   storage locations to include parked AE loaded aircraft.
   13.16.2. Missile batteries deployed within the IBD of AE storage areas may be sited at K18
   to manned functions considered related to area AE operations. Likewise, missile batteries
   deployed in the clear zones of flight line operations may be sited at K18 to manned flight line
   facilities.
   13.16.3. Those functions solely providing support to static missile units, such as motor
   pools, may be sited at K18 to batteries and other AE activities when the missile battery is
   located in these areas. For asset preservation, use PTRD.
 346                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   13.16.4. No separation is required between missile batteries and the security force structures
   exclusively supporting them.
13.17. Emergency Destruction. When it becomes necessary to destroy stores of AE to prevent
them from falling to the enemy, care must be taken to ensure that assets otherwise not in danger
of falling to the enemy are not destroyed by blast or fragments. MAJCOMs will develop specific
guidance for the implementation of and training for emergency destruction of munitions, if
applicable. Normal disposal operations will be conducted in accordance with paragraphs 12.73
and 12.74.
13.18. Separation From Fuel.
   13.18.1. Operational Storage. Quantities up to 500 gal will be separated from each PES by
   at least 50 ft. Quantities between 500 to 5,000 gal will be separated from each PES by at
   least 100 ft. Fuel shall be located downhill and diked to contain a possible fuel spill.
   13.18.2. Bulk Fuel Storage. For more than 5,000 gal apply paragraph 12.81.

                               EXPLOSIVES SITE PLANNING

Section 14A—Introduction

14.1. Purpose of Explosives Site Planning. Explosives site planning is a process used to
manage the risks associated with explosives activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel,
equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. Planning for the proper location and
construction of explosives facilities, and facilities exposed to explosives facilities, is a key
element of the explosives site planning process. This process also ensures that risks above those
normally accepted for explosives activities are identified and presented to the appropriate
commander for approval. The explosives site planning process is applicable to all day-to-day (to
include training and exercises), contingency, combat, and MOOTW activities, as well as wartime
planning.
14.2. Responsibilities for Explosives Site Planning. Safety, in coordination with civil
engineering, fire, health, security, and environmental agencies, is responsible for performing
explosives site planning.

Section 14B—Explosives Clear Zones

14.3. Explosives Clear Zones. The explosives clear zone is the area surrounding a PES which
is determined by the required IB separation. The IB separation will be based on the sited,
waivered, exempted, or actual explosives limits of the potential explosion site, whichever is
greatest.
14.4. Monitoring of Explosives Clear Zones. Safety and civil engineering will monitor and
control construction and facility utilization inside explosives clear zones. Management of
explosives safety clear zones is a cornerstone of the explosives site planning process.
14.5. Mapping Requirements for Explosives Clear Zones.
   14.5.1. Explosives clear zones for all approved day-to-day and war plan explosives site plans
   (ESP) will be reflected on the installation Comprehensive Plan Maps C-1, D-8, E-9 and M-3
   (as applicable). For tiered siting, (see paragraph 14.20) only the largest explosives clear
   zone need be shown, except on the D-8 which must show the explosives clear zones for all
   tiers. Explosives clear zones must reflect the DDESB-, AFSC- or MAJCOM-approved net
   explosives weight and IB distance.
   14.5.2. The weapons safety manager will assist civil engineering in determining the
   explosives clear zones required on appropriate base maps.
   14.5.3. Explosives clear zones need not be changed on base maps when they are expanded
   for a short-term (1 year or less) situation, such as for a waiver lasting less than a year.
14.6. Reduction or Re-designation of Explosives Clear Zones. When a permanent reduction
or re-designation of any explosives clear zone is required, a coordinated (installation safety, civil
engineering, and logistics) request letter is prepared and submitted to the host MAJCOM Safety
Office through the respective MAJCOM activity offices. Requests must be signed by the
 352                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


installation commander and include justification for the reduction. To better evaluate the impact
if the reduction is not approved, include a clear zone map showing both the old and the proposed
clear zones. No actions will be taken to redraw base maps until DDESB approval is received.
MAJCOM approval is needed for complete removal of clear zone. MAJCOM will forward a
copy of the approval to AFSC/SEW.

Section 14C—Explosives Site Plans

14.7. Explosives Site Plans. Explosives Site Plans (ESPs) are a method to document the results
of the explosives site planning process. An ESP package consists of all the information
necessary to assess compliance with explosives safety standards (especially QD). Once
approved, the ESP identifies storage and operational limitations, and provides a tool for
managing risks associated with the storage or operating location.
14.8. Funding for Projects Requiring Explosives Site Plans. Prior to approval of an ESP,
expend only limited Air Force funds on the ESP project. ESP approval is covered in paragraph
14.15. All funds spent prior to approval may be placed at risk if explosives safety standards are
not followed properly. The investment could be lost if site plan approval is contingent on
changes or new facility requirements that were not considered or adequately addressed during
the ESP preparation and review process. It is strongly suggested that at least Preliminary ESP
approval (see paragraph 14.13.) be obtained before awarding a contract for new construction of
explosives facilities or non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone.
14.9. Situations Requiring Explosives Site Plans. ESPs will be developed and submitted for
review and approval for the following situations:
   14.9.1. New construction of explosives facilities.
   14.9.2. New construction of non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone.
   14.9.3. Modification or change to the use of explosives facilities, as required per paragraph
   14.11.
   14.9.4. Modification or change to the use of non-explosives facilities within an explosives
   clear zone, as required per paragraph 14.11.
   14.9.5. Recurring training and exercise explosives activities which occur in fixed locations,
   except as allowed in paragraph 14.10.9.
   14.9.6. War plan explosives activities. War plan explosives activities are those that are
   planned in response to an approved operational plan. They are only projections based on
   possible or likely scenarios, and include planned operations at collocated operating bases
   (COBs).
   14.9.7. Contingency, combat, and MOOTW explosives activities, as required per Chapter
   13.
14.10. Situations Not Requiring Explosives Site Plans. ESPs are not required for the
following situations:
   14.10.1. Storage and associated HD 1.4S handling (see paragraph 12.29.3.).
   14.10.2. Interchange yards limited to those operations described in paragraph 12.59.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   353


   14.10.3. Inspection stations where only the operations described in paragraph 12.58. are
   performed.
   14.10.4. Parking aircraft loaded with specific munitions (see paragraph 12.47., while the
   aircraft is located in designated aircraft parking areas that meet airfield criteria. This
   includes associated handling of these munitions, provided the quantity of munitions involved
   in the operation is limited to a single aircraft load.
   14.10.5. Hung ordnance areas, arm or de-arm areas, and hot pit refueling areas not used as
   parking areas (see paragraph 12.44. and 12.45.), unless they are located in an explosives
   clear zone. In that case, they will be sited as a non-explosives exposed site.
   14.10.6. Licensed explosives storage locations, unless they are located in an explosives clear
   zone. In that case, they will be sited as a non-explosives exposed site.
   14.10.7. Explosives operations associated with licensed explosives storage locations.
   14.10.8. Inert storage accessed by personnel related to the explosives mission.
   14.10.9. Activation of simulators and smoke-producing devices in single or small quantities
   when used in conjunction with exercises and training (to include readiness inspections). See
   paragraph 7.26 for guidance.
   14.10.10. Unmanned, non-explosives miscellaneous structures that have a QD requirement
   of fifty feet or less do not require an ESP, even if new construction is involved.
14.11. Facility Modifications or Change in Use. Existing explosives facilities and exposed
facilities within explosives clear zones may require modification or change in use to meet
changing mission requirements. Such modifications and changes in use must be evaluated to
determine if they affect the application of explosives safety requirements as approved in the
original ESP.
   14.11.1. A new ESP is required if the facility modification or change in use may require the
   application of new or more stringent explosives criteria as follows:
       14.11.1.1. Classification of the facility for QD purposes is changed (e.g., explosives
       storage facility is changed to an operating location).
       14.11.1.2. NEWQD is increased.
       14.11.1.3. New HD is introduced.
       14.11.1.4. Overall floor space is increased (to include vertical additions).
       14.11.1.5. Additional personnel performing a different function are introduced.
       14.11.1.6. Effectiveness of built-in safety features is compromised (e.g., opening is made
       in a SDW).
       14.11.1.7. The installation of a new lightning protection system (e.g., the complete
       replacement of an existing system or replacing an integral system with a mast or catenary
       system).
   14.11.2. If the facility modification or change in use does not require the application of more
   stringent QD criteria and is not covered by a waiver or exemption, a letter describing the
   facility modification or change in use is required and will be submitted to the MAJCOM for
 354                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   approval. Prior to approval, the MAJCOM will ensure the facility modification or change in
   use does not affect the explosives safety criteria applied in the original ESP.
   14.11.3. Any modification or change in use to a facility covered by a waiver or exemption to
   this standard must be reviewed by AFSC/SEW. MAJCOM/SEW will submit a letter
   thoroughly describing the facility modification or change in use. AFSC/SEW will provide
   appropriate siting actions required.
   14.11.4. Do not start construction on a project requiring an ESP until approval is granted by
   the DDESB. For site plans covering day-to-day operations where no construction is involved,
   do not start explosives operations or non-explosives operations within explosives clear zones
   until the site plan is approved at MAJCOM level. The Combatant Commander may authorize
   explosives operations or construction pending siting approval for operations in support of or
   in expectation of actual MOOTW, contingency, and combat operations.
14.12. Explosives Site Plan Development and Installation-level Coordination.
   14.12.1. The civil engineer or facility user notifies weapons safety as soon as a need is
   identified to build, modify, or change the use of any explosives facility or non-explosives
   facility located within an explosives clear zone. Weapons safety determines the need for an
   ESP and solicits the information to prepare the request.
   14.12.2. The civil engineer assists safety in development of the ESP by providing current
   maps or drawings and technical facility design assistance. Also, the civil engineer supplies
   facility design information such as construction, grounding, technical facility design
   assistance, and lightning protection information.
       14.12.3. Site for maximum weights based on actual separation distances or capacity for
       storage locations; however, for other locations site for MEQ/operational limits.
   14.12.4. Coordinate the ESP with civil engineering and the user. Coordinate with fire,
   health, security, legal and environmental agencies, as appropriate.
   14.12.5. Coordinate the ESP with bioenvironmental engineering if it involves biological and
   chemical fillers, liquid propellants, toxic gases, sonic hazard areas, any form of
   electromagnetic radiation, laser or other directed energy weapons (DEW) affecting health or
   the environment on-base (including radioactive sources and microwave generators and
   industrial x-ray). The MAJCOM will forward an information copy of the ESP to the AF
   Medical Support Agency (AFMSA/SG3PB), 1400 Key Blvd, Suite 400, Arlington VA
   22209.
   14.12.6. When tenant facilities, including those of other services, are exposed, coordinate the
   ESP with the tenant unit. For ESPs that expose host nation tenant facilities or areas, notify
   the host nation commander of the exposure and obtain host nation approval as required by
   international treaty or status of forces agreement.
   14.12.7. In cases where the explosives clear zone encroaches onto adjacent government
   agencies, such as another Air Force, or an Army, Navy or Marine installation, obtain written
   acknowledgement from the exposed service component for inclusion with the ESP. (Note: It
   will be up to the acknowledging agency to update their maps to reflect the explosives clear
   zone for their future planning purposes.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    355


   14.12.8. ESPs involving contractors must be reviewed and approved through the Defense
   Plant Representative Office (DPRO), Administrative Contract Office (ACO) and the
   Designated Acquisition Official’s (DAO) safety office prior to Air Force processing. Local
   level shall coordinate with responsible contracting officer.
14.13. Explosives Site Plan Contents. ESPs will contain the information described in Section
14D. In some instances, a compressed timeline (such as that imposed by the design and build
process) may require contract award or site preparation activities (e.g., facility demolition,
grading or other site preparation) before all of the information required in Section 14D is
available. In these instances, request Preliminary ESP approval. Preliminary ESPs will include
the information required in Section 14D, except for facility construction drawings and any
required structural engineering analyses. Specifically address the action for which approval is
requested (e.g. contract award, facility demolition). Submit a request for Final ESP approval as
soon as the construction drawings and any required structural engineering analyses are
completed.
14.14. Explosives Site Plan Submission and MAJCOM and Air Force-level Coordination
Process.
   14.14.1. The ESP originates at the installation level (See paragraph 14.26.). The primary
   means for ESP origination is through the use of ASHS. MAJCOM/SEW will review the ESP
   for accuracy and compliance with the standards in this Manual and applicable MAJCOM
   supplements. MAJCOMs will then electronically submit the coordinated ESP to AFSC/SEW
   (unless the ESP may be approved by the MAJCOM per paragraph 14.15). Include a
   MAJCOM endorsement stating approval along with any changes, modifications or specific
   precautionary measures considered necessary. After review by AFSC/SEW, the ESP is
   endorsed and electronically submitted to the DDESB for approval. Reviewing agencies will
   provide the ESP originator and previous review agency a copy of comments or changes made
   which affect the original intent of the ESP. Any change affecting the content of the unit’s
   ASHS database would require changes made at the unit.
   14.14.2. Air Force Host to Tenant Relationships. ESPs for tenant units will be sent
   through host installation and tenant command channels. In cases where the host violates
   ESQD to a tenant facility, the host MAJCOM will obtain coordination from the tenant
   MAJCOM before processing the ESP. Where no violation exists, provide an information
   copy of the ESP to the tenant MAJCOM when processing to AFSC/SEW. If required by the
   tenant MAJCOM, the ESP must meet the requirements of the tenant MAJCOM supplement
   to this Manual.
   14.14.3. Inter-service Host to Tenant Relationships.
       14.14.3.1. When an Air Force unit is tenant on an Army, Navy or Marine installation,
       request ESP approval through that service. The ESP must meet the QD requirements of
       this Manual in addition to all host agency criteria. Submit an information copy of the
       ESP request through the MAJCOM to AFSC/SEW.
       14.14.3.2. Tenant Army, Navy or Marine units forward ESP requests through Air Force
       host installation channels. Air Force host will assist tenant units in preparing the ESP. In
       cases where the Air Force host violates ESQD to a tenant facility, the host MAJCOM will
       obtain coordination from the tenant MAJCOM equivalent before processing the ESP.
 356                                                     AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       Where no violation exists, provide an information copy of the ESP to the tenant
       MAJCOM equivalent when processing to AFSC/SEW.
       14.14.3.3. AFSC/SEW will coordinate with the applicable service component before
       processing the ESP. In cases where the Air Force host violates ESQD to a tenant facility,
       AFSC/SEW will obtain coordination from the applicable service component before
       processing the ESP. Where no violation exists, an information copy of the ESP will be
       sent to the applicable service component when processing for final approval.
   14.14.4. AFSC/SEW will coordinate requests for ESP approval with the applicable service
   component if an Air Force explosives clear zone encroaches onto an adjacent Air Force,
   Army, Navy or Marine installation.
   14.14.5. The installation or MAJCOM may request expeditious AFSC/SEW processing of
   an ESP with the exception of an ESP requiring SAF/IE acceptance of risk or SECAF
   approval for new construction. Requests for expeditious processing of an ESP will include
   the information required in paragraph 14.22.19. MAJCOM/SE must endorse an installation
   request for expeditious processing for AFSC/SEW to act on the request.
14.15. Explosives Site Plan Approval.
   14.15.1. Except as authorized in paragraph 14.15.2, ESPs will be approved as follows:
       14.15.1.1. Day-to-day ESPs will be approved by DDESB, unless they contain a waiver
       or exemption. Day-to-day ESPs with waivers or exemptions will be submitted as Hybrid
       Safety Submissions (HSS) to the DDESB for final approval after approval of the waiver
       or exemption in accordance with Section 1B. Do not start new construction until
       authorized by the approved ESP. (Note: If included in the ESP request, Preliminary ESP
       approval may authorize some construction planning activities to begin. See paragraph
       14.13.) Do not commence explosives operations or events unless authorized by an
       approved operational waiver in accordance with paragraph 1.5. Operational waiver
       documentation requirements prescribed in paragraph 1.5.4 may be addressed in the ESP
       submission to the MAJCOM and AFSC/SEW. Once the ESP is reviewed by AFSC, the
       ESP is transmitted to the greatest extent possible by electronic means to the DDESB or
       the MAJCOM is notified of additional information needed to gain DDESB approval. If
       additional information is needed to complete the ESP package, it should be provided
       within 45 days of AFSC initial review comments or notification to AFSC from the
       MAJCOM with a status of delay and estimated response date. If continued delay of
       gathering additional information is encountered, AFSC will return the ESP as
       disapproved, with a detailed explanation of the reason for disapproval. At this time, the
       operational waiver authorization for operations to commence is invalidated. The entire
       ESP may be resubmitted under a new control number once all criteria is met and included
       in the ESP submission.
       14.15.1.2. Contingency, combat, and MOOTW ESPs will be approved as required per
       Chapter 13, unless they involve new construction. Contingency, combat, and MOOTW
       ESPs involving new construction will be approved by the DDESB, unless they contain
       waivers or exemptions. Contingency, combat, and MOOTW ESPs involving new
       construction with waivers or exemptions will be submitted as HSS to the DDESB for
       final approval after approval of the waiver or exemption in accordance with Section 1B.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 357


       The Combatant Commander may authorize new construction to begin in support of or in
       expectation of actual contingency, combat, and MOOTW operations.
       14.15.1.3. War plan ESPs will be approved by the MAJCOM/CC/CV, unless they
       involve new construction; MAJCOM will provide a copy of the ESP to AFSC/SEW.
       War plan ESPs involving new construction will be approved by the DDESB, unless they
       contain waivers or exemptions. War plan ESPs involving new construction with waivers
       or exemptions will be submitted as HSS to the DDESB for final approval after approval
       of the waiver or exemption in accordance with Section 1B. Do not start construction until
       authorized by the approved ESP. (Note: If included in the ESP request, Preliminary ESP
       approval may authorize some construction activities to begin. See paragraph 14.13.)
       Combined day-to-day and war plan ESPs (e.g. using tiered siting) will be approved
       according to paragraph 14.15.1.1.
   14.15.2. Approval levels for unique situations are as follows:
       14.15.2.1. ESPs for training and exercise areas using flares, simulators, and smoke
       producing devices (HD 1.2.2, 1.3 and 1.4 only), and not within an established clear zone,
       will be approved by the MAJCOM. This applies to recurring training locations and not to
       exercise support activities that move each time in accordance with exercise scenarios.
       Required separation distances will be documented per paragraph 7.26. for exercise
       support activities that do not have a fixed location.
       14.15.2.2. ESPs for installation of WSVs in HASs with previously approved ESPs will
       be approved by the MAJCOM.
       14.15.2.3. ESPs for Contractor Owned Contractor Operated (COCO) facilities on non-
       government land will be approved by the Procuring Contract Officer (PCO) for Air Force
       contracts involving explosives or ammunition. ESPs are prepared and submitted by the
       contractor. These ESPs need not be forwarded to either AFMC, AFSC, or the DDESB.
       The Defense Contract Management Agency evaluates the ESP and provides approval or
       disapproval recommendations to the PCO.
       14.15.2.4. ESPs for Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) facilities and
       COCO facilities on government land will be approved by the DDESB. Waivers and
       exemptions will be approved by the responsible PCO and Air Force command level as
       prescribed in chapter 1.
       14.15.2.5. ESPs for non-DoD explosives activities on Air Force installations will be
       approved by the DDESB (see paragraph 14.17).
14.16. Maintenance of Approved Explosives Site Plans. Approved ESPs (including the
approval letter) will be maintained by the installation safety office and using organization.

Section 14D—Explosives Site Plan Requirements

14.17. Explosives Site Plans for Non-DoD Explosives Activities on Air Force Installations.
       14.17.1. ESPs for non-DoD explosives activities on Air Force installations will include a
       risk assessment for all exposed government personnel, equipment, and assets (within or
       outside the explosives clear zone) and documented risk acceptance by the responsible
       commander. The responsible commander must consider the possible impact to current
 358                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       and future DoD mission requirements in the event of a mishap. Non-DoD user insurance
       coverage for government equipment and assets will not, by itself, be adequate
       justification for exposure to unacceptable risk.
   14.17.2. ESPs for non-DoD explosives activities on Air Force installations will either be
   prepared in accordance with the requirements of this section, or will be ―foot print‖ only
   ESPs. Foot print ESPs will contain only the information necessary to determine the
   explosives clear zone (i.e., building design, LPS, etc., will not be included unless it is used to
   determine the explosives clear zone).
   14.17.3. ESP approval alone does not authorize the conduct of non-DoD explosives
   activities on Air Force installations (see paragraph 12.88.).
   14.17.4. See paragraph 12.88. for QD criteria for non-DoD explosives activities on Air
   Force installations, and paragraph 1.9 for guidance on exceptions to this Manual.
14.18. Siting a Non-Explosives Exposed Site. For new construction, modification, or change
in use of non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone it is acceptable to submit an
ESP for the non-explosives facilities. These ESPs will comply with all applicable requirements
of this section and include QD evaluations for all PESs within the evaluation zone. See
paragraph 14.24.7., Table 14.1. and Figure 14.1.
14.19. Explosives Site Plans Involving Exceptions. ESPs involving exceptions to this Manual
will include the information required per Section 1B.
14.20. Tiered Explosives Site Plans. Tiered ESPs may be useful when the NEWQD of a PES
varies because of operational requirements (e.g., day-to-day, exercise, war plan, contingency,
combat, and MOOTW). It may also be useful when it is not practical on a day-to-day basis to
meet the required QD separation from a PES to all ESs for the largest possible NEWQD. Under
the tiered ESP concept, the responsible commander may take management actions (e.g., removal
of personnel or equipment, re-designation of exposed sites) before introducing explosives or
increasing the NEWQD of a PES.
   14.20.1. To prepare tiered ESPs, determine the NEWQD required for each type of activity at
   the PES and the QD separation required to each ES for each NEWQD. In instances where
   the required QD separation cannot be met at a given NEWQD, determine if management
   actions may be taken to meet the required QD separation. If the required QD separation
   cannot be met even with management actions, process a waiver or exemption in accordance
   with Section 1B.
   14.20.2. Prepare a management plan to document management actions required for each tier
   of the ESP. This management plan may be implemented as a base operations plan, operating
   instruction, agreement, supplement or other appropriate publication. The management plan
   must specify:
       14.20.2.1. Description of each management action required.
       14.20.2.2. Conditions under which each management action will be directed and when
       they will take place.
       14.20.2.3. The organization responsible for implementing each management action.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   359


       14.20.2.4. Requirement for periodic review of the management plan to ensure continued
       viability of the planned management actions.
   14.20.3. Tiered ESPs will:
       14.20.3.1. Include an AF Form 943,Explosives Site Plan for each tier, and assign a
       separate ESP action number to each tier.
       14.20.3.2. Reference the document which implements the management plan required in
       paragraph 14.20.2. It is not necessary to include a copy of this document.
14.21. Components of the Explosives Site Plan. ESPs must include all the information needed
for the reviewer to determine if the explosives safety requirements of this Manual are being met.
Although the exact contents of an ESP may vary depending on the activity to be sited, ESPs
generally include a transmittal letter, an AF Form 943, a site location map, and various
attachments. For some ESPs, a transmittal letter containing pertinent information and a map may
be all that is necessary. Other ESPs may require documentation such as detailed drawings,
engineering analyses, risk assessments, commanders’ risk acceptances, etc, in order to verify
compliance with explosives safety requirements. See paragraph 14.26.
14.22. Transmittal Letter.
   14.22.1. The transmittal letter is important for getting an ESP successfully reviewed and
   approved. Generally, all aspects of the siting should be explained; attempt to answer any
   questions before it is raised. Consider that personnel reviewing the ESP may not be familiar
   with the base or operation, including unique terminology, and do not know the mission or
   specific circumstances. If the AF Form 943 contains a modification to the ASHS generated
   quantity-distance, explain the change in the transmittal letter. A sample transmittal letter is
   provided in Attachment 2.
   14.22.2. Include the ESP action number in the subject line of the memorandum. ESP action
   numbers are developed as follows:
       14.22.2.1. The requesting MAJCOM designation, followed by the tenant MAJCOM
       designation, if appropriate. Examples: USAFE, or AFMC-ACC.
       14.22.2.2. The installation where the PES is located. Examples: Hill, Ramstein, or
       Logan.
       14.22.2.3. Calendar year designation. Examples: 04, or 05.
       14.22.2.4. An (S) identifier followed by a sequence number. Examples: S26, or S39.
       Number each request sequentially for each calendar year. For example, the first ESP for
       the calendar year would be S1. Canceled requests will not affect the number of
       subsequent requests. For example, if USAFE-Ramstein-04-S10 were canceled, the next
       ESP submitted for Ramstein AB in 2004 would be S11.
       14.22.2.5. If the ESP involves QD exceptions, include the statement, ―WITH
       EXCEPTIONS‖ immediately following the ESP action number. Example: ACC-
       Barksdale-04-S33, WITH EXCEPTIONS. If the ESP involves only compensatory
       measures that avoid all QD exceptions, include the statement, ―WITH
       COMPENSATORY MEASURES‖ immediately following the ESP action number.
360                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


         14.22.2.5.1. Units will develop a means to assure continued implementation of
         compensatory measures per MAJCOM direction.
      14.22.2.6. If the transmittal letter is for more than one ESP, include the ESP action
      number for each ESP. Examples: PACAF-Hickam-04-S5, S6, and S10, or AMC-Scott-
      05-S20 through S34.
  14.22.3. Begin the letter by explaining the purpose of the submission. Example: ―Request
  routine processing for subject site plan for preliminary approval.‖ Identify whether the ESP
  supports day-to-day operations, war plan operations, day-to-day and war plan operations, or
  MOOTW, contingency, and combat operations. Identify if preliminary or final approval is
  being requested. If new construction is involved, include this statement in the subject line:
  ―Involving new Construction.‖ This ensures reviewing and approval authorities correctly
  prioritize the submission request for review.
  14.22.4. State the reason(s) for the request. Examples: ―to construct a new maintenance and
  inspection facility,‖ or ―to increase the NEWQD at an existing above ground magazine.‖
  Clearly identify whether new construction is being requested; expeditious and new
  construction ESPs will receive priority processing.
  14.22.5. If the ESP replaces an existing ESP include a cancellation statement. Example:
  ―The modification to this facility cancels ESP AFMC-Hill-02-S7.‖
  14.22.6. State whether or not all explosives safety criteria will be met. If there are waivers
  or exemptions, provide a unique exception identification tracking number for each waiver or
  exemption. This number is developed using the format as described in paragraphs 14.22.2.1.
  through 14.22.2.5., with the following modifications:
      14.22.6.1. Use the identifier (W) for waivers or (E) for exemptions instead of (S) for the
      identification tracking number in Column 10 of the AF Form 943 for the applicable
      exposure. This unique identification number will be based on the approval level,
      installation, and calendar year. Each installation will use their own numbering
      sequence. For example, use ACC-Hill-05-W01 as the first MAJCOM-level waiver
      identification number at Hill AFB for calendar year 2005. Use 388FW-Hill-05-W01 for
      the first wing-level waiver identification number. Subsequent site plan submissions with
      QD exceptions within the same calendar year would use the next available identification
      number at that installation for the type of exception required. For example, the next
      MAJCOM-level waiver identification number at Hill AFB would be ACC-Hill-05-W02
      while the first MAJCOM-level exemption would use ACC-Hill-05-E01. This method
      will allow accurate tracking of exceptions based on the approval level, installation and
      calendar year. Include superseded waiver or exemption identification numbers if
      applicable.
  14.22.7. If the ESP has any unique characteristics, explain what criteria is being applied and
  the basis for the application.
  14.22.8. Describe compensatory measures if they are necessary to meet QD standards. The
  responsible commander must sign ESPs containing compensatory measures.
      14.22.8.1. Units will develop a means to assure continued implementation of
      compensatory measures per MAJCOM direction.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 361


  14.22.9. For ESPs involving new construction, include the project identification and
  Programming, Design, and Construction (PDC) number.
  14.22.10. Discuss any future plans that may impact this siting. State that the Base Facilities
  Board has reconciled this particular site plan with the base comprehensive plan. Provide
  meeting minutes, dated reference or written record of reconciliation.
  14.22.11. Explain the format being used to record QD evaluation. Example: ―The attached
  AF Form 943 and map show all exposures and required separations.‖
  14.22.12. Provide a narrative description of the relevant explosives safety aspects of the
  facility design.
     14.22.12.1. If the facility includes an LPS, state that it meets all design requirements of
     this Manual, NFPA 780, AFI 32-1065, and attach LPS drawings. For PESs, if the facility
     does not include an LPS, state what exception is being applied per paragraph 5.25.,
     address any requirements relevant to that exception, and attach the commander’s risk
     acceptance if required.
     14.22.12.2. If protective construction features not previously approved by the DDESB
     are to be used (e.g., personnel shields, blast-resistant construction), a structural
     engineering analysis and construction drawings must be attached (see paragraph 14.25.3).
     Provide a summary of the results of the structural engineering analysis.
     14.22.12.3. Describe how compliance with the glass panel design requirements of
     Section 5B will be met. Attach a glass breakage risk assessment if required.
     14.22.12.4. Describe results of EMR survey.
     14.22.12.5. Describe unique safety aspects of the facility design such as the presence of
     hazardous locations, use of conductive floors, etc.
     14.22.12.6. If the facility design is a standard design that the DDESB has previously
     reviewed and declared acceptable, construction drawings do not need to be submitted.
     Identify the drawing number and the source of previous DDESB approval (e.g., DDESB
     TP 15, Approved Protective Construction). HASs may be referred to by type (e.g., 3rd
     GEN, Korean TAB VEE). Contact MAJCOM/SEW if definitive drawing numbers are
     unknown. Describe any planned deviations from the standard design for purposes of
     local site adaptation (e.g., addition of gunite cover to an ECM to protect from erosion);
     do not make changes to standard designs that affect the explosives safety characteristics
     of the facility.
  14.22.13. For tiered ESPs, identify the management plan implementation document.
  14.22.14. Describe the evaluation zone used. State if the evaluation zone does not exceed
  the IB distance, or if there are no PESs in the evaluation zone.
  14.22.15. State if a commanders authorized risk acceptance option is being applied and the
  derivative paragraph/table/note option allowing the commanders risk acceptance.
  14.22.16. Identify and explain the purpose of all attachments.
  14.22.17. Address compliance with ESP coordination requirements (e.g., notification or
  coordination with host nation officials, discussions with tenant units, etc.).
 362                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   14.22.18. Staff agency point of contact in the event clarification is required.
   14.22.19. If expeditious processing is being requested, include the following:
       14.22.19.1. On the subject line of the memorandum state: ―Request for EXPEDITIOUS
       processing of Explosives Site Plan (ESP) AFSPC-Vandenberg-04-S2.‖
       14.22.19.2. Explain the reasons why expeditious processing is necessary. These reasons
       must show sufficient mission impact to warrant the expeditious processing, or the ESP
       will be reviewed according to the routine processing procedures.
       14.22.19.3. Date when approval is needed and why it is needed by that date. Example:
       ―Approval is required by 15 Jun 05 to support planned contract award for new
       construction.‖ Require MAJCOM/SE approval and signature.
14.23. AF Form 943. AF Form 943 is used to provide PES and ES information and to validate
required QD separation. Prepare a separate AF Form 943 for each PES (or ES in the case of an
ES ESP) to be sited. See paragraph 14.27 for alternative formats to the AF Form 943.
Instructions for completing AF Form 943 are provided in Figure 14.2. A sample AF Form 943 is
provided in Figure 14.3. Include the following information on the AF Form 943:
   14.23.1. ESP action number (see paragraph 14.22.2).
   14.23.2. Location of the PES or ES being sited. If the location is not a military installation,
   list civilian or commercial address.
   14.23.3. For explosives locations, identify all ESs and PESs within the IB distance, and all
   PESs within the evaluation zone (EZ) if it is larger than the IB distance. For ESPs with an IB
   distance less than 100 ft, ensure exposures requiring a minimum separation distance (e.g.,
   100 ft for parking areas exclusively supporting the PES) are identified. For non-explosive
   locations, identify all PESs within the EZ. For some non-explosive locations, it may not be
   necessary to identify all PESs; for example, unmanned miscellaneous structures requiring 50
   feet separation from any PES can be sited by merely identifying the nearest PES.
   14.23.4. The EZ is based on the QD type of the ES (e.g., Operating Location, CAPA), and
   the largest NEWQD PES on the installation. To determine the size of the EZ, when a K
   Factor is required use the largest HD 1.1 NEWQD authorized in a single PES on the
   installation or within the established clear zone (maximum of 500,000 pounds); see Table
   14.1. For other HDs, use the minimum prescribed distances found in the appropriate QD
   tables. See Figure 14.1. for examples of EZs.
   14.23.5. For all PESs and ESs, provide the following:
       14.23.5.1. Assigned CE building number or other identifier. Examples: Bldg 123, or
       F123.
       14.23.5.2. Applicable Table 12.(X) description. Examples: ECM, or Related Facility.
       Identify the presence of barricades if they affect the QD required.
       14.23.5.3. Primary operation normally expected at the facility. Examples: shipping and
       receiving, maintenance and inspection, or bomb build-up. If facility type determines QD
       criteria applied, include definition of building such as Korean TAB VEE, 3rd Gen HAS,
       26x60 igloo, 26x40 igloo, etc. Show definitive drawing numbers when available.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   363


     14.23.5.4. The organization whose assets or people will be in the facility. Include the
     MAJCOM, Wing, Squadron, and show unit designations by number and alpha
     designation. Include the branch of service if other than the Air Force. Example:
     USAFE-52FW.
     14.23.5.5. Total number of people (M for Military or DoD Civilian, C for Non-DoD
     Civilian, DC for Defense Contractors, and FN for Foreign Nationals) normally
     assigned to the location. Consider the number of persons present during exercises. Do
     not include casuals such as inspectors or quality control evaluators. Include a breakdown
     by room or bay, when appropriate. Do not show people assigned to explosives storage
     locations, AECPAs, or CAPAs.
  14.23.6. For all PES, provide the NEWQD for all HDs (HD 1.2.3, 1.5 and 1.6 may be
  omitted unless quantities will be present). Include MCE for HD 1.2.1. Include LSRN and
  parenthetical fragment distance for HD 1.2.3. If no LSRN is specified, use the NEWQD of
  the single round. If no NEWQD is provided, contact AFSC/SEW.             For HD 1.4 show
  ―Capacity‖ or ―Op Limit.‖ If no explosives in a particular HD will be present, type ―None.‖
  For multiple room facilities, show values for each room where explosives will be present.
  Where IM is not provided between rooms or cubicles, show overall values for the facility. If
  explosives are unpackaged see Section 3C. The explosive authorization must always show
  the sited, waived, or exempted weights, whichever is greater.
  14.23.7. It is important to ensure facilities or locations being sited, whether explosive or
  non-explosive, within the IBD and EZ comply with QD requirements. This is accomplished
  by conducting a paired relationship evaluation. A facility or location where explosives will
  be present must be evaluated as both a PES and an ES. This is a two-way evaluation
  between the pair and the most restrictive distance between the pair is documented. A non-
  explosive ES is a one-way evaluation from surrounding PESs to the ES.
  14.23.8. Identify the actual separation between each pair.
  14.23.9. Using applicable Chapter 12 Table and applicable notes, identify the most
  restrictive (greatest) separation distance required between each pair for each HD, and the
  appropriate K-factor, minimum distance or rule used to determine this distance.
  14.23.10. For each instance where the required separation is greater than the actual
  separation, provide the exception identification number (see paragraph 14.22.6).
  14.23.11. For ESPs with waivers or exemptions, include the following:
     14.23.11.1. Indicate the effect a maximum credible event at the PES would have on the
     unit mission, or other supported agencies (see Chapter 2).
     14.23.11.2. Describe any corrective actions, compensatory measures, and controls to
     achieve safety during operations if the ESP is approved. State whether corrective action
     can or cannot be done locally with available funds or other resources. If there is no
     planned construction or other corrective actions, explain why. Show planned or
     programmed (funded and unfunded) actions to eliminate exceptions. Such action might
     include recommendations to higher headquarters, assigning priorities, funding revisions
     to standard facilities, etc. If there are other local projects underway that involve funding,
     show the following: construction priority assigned, Military Construction Program
 364                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       (MCP) item number and fiscal year for construction. Include any operational controls
       necessary.
       14.23.11.3. Give the reason for the request. Describe the impact if the requested action
       is not approved.
   14.23.12. If exceptions are involved, or if compensatory measures are used to prevent an
   exception, include approvals from the appropriate agencies and the responsible commander.
   For exceptions, the responsible commander's signature shows that the request is needed for
   the mission and that the risks are acceptable for strategic or compelling reasons. For
   compensatory measures, the responsible commander’s signature shows that the
   compensatory measures are acceptable and will be enforced.
14.24. Site Location Map. A sample site location map is provided in Figure 14.4.
   14.24.1. Submit a map which clearly shows all the PESs and ESs relevant to the ESP.
   14.24.2. Use a 1‖= 400’ (or similar metric) scale. To enhance clarity or show precise
   measurements, a larger (1‖=200’ or 100’) scaled map may be used. To properly reflect
   certain distance and structure relationships within the area surrounding the project, a smaller
   scaled map may be used. Provide the scale on the map. Express all distances in feet, if
   feasible. An ASHS-generated map is acceptable.
   14.24.3. Details such as the specific points of measurement, actual and required distance,
   and NEWQDs are encouraged.
   14.24.4. When there is reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the mapped location, it is the
   responsibility of all participants in the explosives site planning process to define a locally
   acceptable method for determining the measurement accuracy required between the PES-ES
   locations.
   14.24.5. If the base boundary is not shown on the map, the transmittal letter must certify the
   relationship of the explosives clear zone to the base boundary for ESPs.
   14.24.6. When siting a PES, show all exposed sites within IBD of the PES. When there is an
   evaluation zone larger than the IB clear zone of the PES being sited show the evaluation zone
   (with dashed line) and the PESs in it.
   14.24.7. When siting an ES, show the evaluation zone (dashed line) and all PESs in the
   evaluation zone.
   14.24.8. Use color coding to simplify and speed the review process. Identify the PESs in red
   and ESs in green. Highlight the clear zone lines in red.
   14.24.9. Include ESP action number, title and scale.
   14.24.10. Show topographic contours or features, such as natural barricades (i.e. dense
   forest) or hills, if they are pertinent to the application of QD.
       14.24.11. When siting multiple PESs show the IBD clear zone for each PES. Show a
       blended clear zone if it provides additional clarity.
14.25. Construction Drawings and Structural Engineering Analyses.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                365

     14.25.1.10. Do not submit drawings (e.g., for landscapes or pavements) that are not
     relevant to QD or safety protective factors.
  14.25.2. LPS drawings must include:
     14.25.2.1. Elements of the lightning protection system, such as air terminals, masts,
     overhead wires, grounding electrode system and a description of the surge protection.
     14.25.2.2. Top, front, side, and additional views as necessary depicting the dimensions
     (spacing and height) between design elements. Front and side elevations depicting air
     terminals and the 100-foot radius (200 feet diameter) rolling sphere zone of protection is
     suggested to facilitate the site plan review process.
  14.25.3. For protective construction features not previously approved by the DDESB,
  provide construction drawings and a structural engineering analysis including:
     14.25.3.1. Statement of the design objectives in terms of protection categories to be
     obtained (see DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction).

14.26. Automated Explosives Site Planning. ASHS is the preferred method of ESP
development of the AF Form 943 and associated map. To the greatest extent possible, ASHS
will be used for ESP creation. In the event an ASHS database is not available for the location
requiring an ESP submission, manual means of ESP development may be used but must be
electronically submitted to the greatest extent possible.

Section 14E—Deleted

14.27. Alternative AF Form 943 Formats. In some instances, modifications to the AF Form
943, or a substitute format in place of the AF Form 943, may be acceptable. Provide a
description of the proposed alternative format, and justification for its use, to the MAJCOM for
approval. MAJCOM will coordinate with AFSC/SEW prior to granting approval. Any
alternative format used must still provide the information required in paragraph 14.23.

  NOTES:
  1. Evaluation zones shown are based on 500,000 pounds NEWQD at the applicable K
  factor for the paired relationship. Smaller evaluation zones may be used based on the
  largest amount of HD 1.1 authorized in a single PES on the installation or within the
  established clear zone. For other HDs, use the prescribed distances found in the
  appropriate QD tables.
  2. Evaluation zones that are smaller than the IB clear zone of the PES being sited have
  no effect because all the facilities within that IB zone are already listed.
  3. Related facilities being evaluated may not be related to the PES on which the EZ
  was determined. In addition to the PESs in the evaluation zone, list those PESs that
  have an IB relationship to the ES.
  4. Evaluation zones for IB targets are used only to determine if an ESP is required.
  Only prepare an ESP for ESs requiring IB distance from all PESs if they are located
  within an explosives clear zone

   REAL PROPERTY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO CONTAIN MUNITIONS AND
           EXPLOSIVES OF CONCERN AND CHEMICAL AGENTS

Section 15A—Introduction

15.1. General. Every means possible shall be used to protect the general public and the
environment from exposure to ammunition and explosive hazards. This includes all explosive
hazard areas, suspected or known to exist, on real property currently or formerly under USAF
ownership or control.
   15.1.1. This chapter establishes explosives safety standards that, when applied, will protect
   people and real property from explosive and CA hazards associated with:
   15.1.1.1. Real property known or suspected to contain:
          15.1.1.1.1. Munitions and explosives of concern (MEC).
          15.1.1.1.2. CA in other than munitions configurations (e.g., DoD laboratory vials,
          CA identification sets, one-ton containers, CA-contaminated soil).
       15.1.1.2. Munitions responses to MEC. (A munitions response to CA-filled munitions
       will be addressed as a chemical warfare material (CWM) response.)
   15.1.1.3. CWM responses
   15.1.2. This chapter establishes a process for determining site-specific actions that, when
   taken, will:
       15.1.2.1. Ensure explosives safety is addressed throughout munitions responses to MEC.
       15.1.2.2. Ensure CA safety and, when applicable, explosives safety is addressed
       throughout CWM responses.
       15.1.2.3. Result in DDESB approval of required safety submissions for munitions
       responses to MEC and for CWM responses. (See section 15.5 for required safety
       submission and their contents.)
       15.1.2.4. Document and report completion of:
          15.1.2.4.1. Munitions responses to MEC
          15.1.2.4.2. CWM responses.
   15.1.3. This chapter does not apply to:
       15.1.3.1. Operational ranges, with the exception of military munitions burial sites located
       on such ranges.
       15.1.3.2. Explosives or munitions emergency responses.

Section 15B—Explosives Safety Standards for the Identification and Control of Areas Known
or Suspected to Contain MEC or CA
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     375


15.2. Identification and Control. To ensure explosives and CA safety risk is identified and
controlled on real property currently or formerly under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the
USAF, installations must:
   15.2.1. Identify all areas known or suspected to present explosive or CA hazards
   (Geographic Information Systems should be used):
       15.2.1.1. In installation master plans for active installations. (In some cases, these areas
       are also required to be identified in other documents.)
       15.2.1.2. In DoD’s military Munitions Response Site Inventory for those sites that are
       included in the Military Munitions Response Program (see Management Guidance for the
       Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) and 10 U.S.C. 2710(a).
   15.2.2. Maintain permanent records of those areas identified pursuant to subparagraph
   15.2.1. and ensure such records are readily available to current and futures users of the
   property. Records should be retained for areas such as operational ranges, former ranges,
   current or former munitions manufacturing facilities, current or former sites used for
   munitions demilitarization activities, and locations previously used for the burial of
   munitions. Records shall:
       15.2.2.1. When practicable, include the nomenclature and the known or suspected
       location.
       15.2.2.2. Summarize any clearance or response (removal or remediation) actions, or
       explosives or munitions emergency responses previously conducted within the area.
   15.2.3. Prohibit unnecessary access and take appropriate action to deter unauthorized access
   to areas under DoD control that are known or suspected of containing potential explosive or
   CA hazards. Such actions may include establishing access controls (e.g. fencing the area,
   establishing roving security patrols), which may be risk-based, or providing public
   notifications of any potential hazards (e.g., posting unexploded ordnance (UXO)-hazard
   warning signs, conducting UXO-safety education programs). When used, signs must be kept
   legible and, when appropriate, in the predominant languages of the region, or as pictograms.
   When the DoD does not exercise jurisdiction, custody, or control over the area (e.g.,
   Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS)), the responsible installation shall, at a minimum,
   provide written notification of the potential explosive or CA hazards to the property owner
   and any known tenants. A record of this notification must be maintained as a permanent
   record. (See subparagraph 15.2.2.)
       15.2.3.1. Installations should, unless there is evidence to the contrary, assume the
       following areas present explosive hazards:
           15.2.3.1.1. Impact areas on operational ranges. Exceptions are ranges known to have
           been exclusively used for training with only small arms ammunition.
           15.2.3.1.2. Former ranges known or suspected to contain MEC.
           15.2.3.1.3. Outdoor demolition areas, to include locations used for open burning
           (OB) or open detonation (OD).
           15.2.3.1.4. Areas that are associated with military munitions production,
           demilitarization, renovation, or similar processes (e.g., operating buildings and any
 376                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


          installed equipment) that generated explosives residues (e.g., dust, vapors, liquids)
          and that might have become contaminated with such residues in concentrations
          sufficient to present explosive hazards, to include areas receiving processing
          wastewater (e.g., settling ponds, drainage swales).
       15.2.3.2. Installations should, unless there is evidence to the contrary, assume the
       following areas present CA hazards:
          15.2.3.2.1. Former CWM or CA burial sites.
          15.2.3.2.2. Former CWM or CA disposal areas.
          15.2.3.2.3. Former CWM impact areas.
          15.2.3.2.4. Former training areas used for training with CWM or CA.
          15.2.3.2.5. Former CWM or CA production and demilitarization facilities.
       15.2.3.3. When access to areas known or suspected to present explosive or CA hazards is
       necessary, a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards associated with the
       proposed activity shall be completed and methods to mitigate any potential exposures
       shall be implemented before access is allowed. (When access is necessary to real
       property not under DoD ownership, custody, or control, installations should obtain a right
       of entry for the property.)
   15.2.4. Prohibit the disposal (e.g., burying, dumping) of military munitions on land or in
   water except when specifically authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM in coordination with
   AFSC/SEW. Such disposal actions must comply with applicable regulatory requirements.
   This prohibition does not preclude:
       15.2.4.1. The covering of munitions with earth to control fragments and noise during
       authorized destruction by detonation.
       15.2.4.2. The use of in situ capping when implemented as an engineered remedy under
       an authorized response action.

Section 15C—Safety Aspects of Explosives and CA Response Actions

15.3. Response Actions
   15.3.1. General
       15.3.1.1. Plans for munitions responses to MEC or CWM responses shall:
          15.3.1.1.1. Ensure close coordination, as applicable, between DoD explosives and
          CA safety organizations, DoD environmental organizations, and appropriate
          regulatory agencies and stakeholders.
          15.3.1.1.2. Specify those actions necessary to protect DoD personnel, installation-
          related personnel, and the public from exposure to explosive and CA hazards.
          15.3.1.1.3. Provide the design for and explain the execution of:
              15.3.1.1.3.1. Munitions responses, when MEC has been determined to present an
                      unacceptable risk.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  377


            15.3.1.1.3.2. CWM responses, when CA, regardless of configuration, has been
            determined to present an unacceptable risk.
        15.3.1.1.4. Explain how the selected response actions will achieve a degree of
        protectiveness necessary for the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future
        land use.
            15.3.1.1.4.1. Provide the rationale for selection of technologies to be used to
            detect anomalies that can indicate the presence of MEC or CA, regardless of CA
            configuration.
            15.3.1.1.4.2. Address how periodically (e.g., during 5-year reviews or consistent
            with long-term monitoring agreements) completed response actions will be
            reviewed to ensure the response remains effective. The need for such reviews is
                    particularly important in areas where natural phenomena (e.g., frost heave,
            soil    erosion, droughts, or tidal action) could expose MEC or CA, regardless of
            CA      configuration, or where Land Use Controls (LUC) constitute a major
            element of      the response. These reviews shall consider:
               15.3.1.1.4.2.1. The explosives safety aspects of munitions responses to MEC.
               15.3.1.1.4.2.2. The CA safety and, when applicable, the explosives safety
               aspects of CWM responses.
        15.3.1.1.5. Address how the personnel qualification provisions of DDESB TP 18
        will be met.
        15.3.1.1.6. Be approved by the DDESB for compliance with DoD explosives safety
        standards.
        15.3.1.1.7. Provide for the submission of an After Action Report (AAR) to the
        DDESB upon completion of the response. AAR are not provided for DDESB
        approval, but are used to close out files maintained by the DDESB Staff.
     15.3.1.2. Residual Explosive and CA Hazards.
        15.3.1.2.1. Some areas that the military has used for munitions-related activities (e.g.,
        live-fire training or testing, OB/OD) or for CA-related activities may not be
        appropriate, even after the performance of response activities, for certain uses (e.g.,
        residential development). Such areas include former military range impact areas on
        which the military has used munitions containing either high explosives or CA and
        sites used for either OB or OD. Such areas may, after a response, be better suited for
        uses that restrict or limit intrusive activities (e.g., wildlife refuges, surface
        recreational areas).
        15.3.1.2.2. Some MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, might not be detected
        or removed during a response. Although residual risks can be managed (e.g., by use
        of agreed-upon LUC, to include safety education; recurring reviews; and construction
        support), residual hazards might still exist.
        15.3.1.2.3. From an explosives and, when applicable, CA safety perspective, the
        degree to which MEC or CA removal is undertaken depends largely on the current,
        determined, or reasonably anticipated future land use. When MEC or CA, regardless
378                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


         of CA configuration, cannot be removed to the degree necessary to safely allow the
         current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future land use, the use must be
         changed or appropriately restricted to obtain DDESB approval of the relevant plan.
      15.3.1.3. When DoD does not control the land and the imposition of LUC is not possible
      (e.g., on FUDS), the responsible installation should, at a minimum, provide the property
      owner, and any known tenants, written notification of the potential residual explosive or
      CA hazards and the risks inherent in any use of property that is consistent with those
      hazards.
  15.3.2. Explosives Safety and CA Safety Aspects in the Selection and Design of Responses
      15.3.2.1. Explosives safety must be addressed in the selection and design of a munitions
      response to MEC. CA safety, and when applicable, explosives safety must be addressed
      in the selection and design of a CWM response. The protection afforded by a response
      must be consistent with the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated land use. The
      design of the response that is included in the required submission must consider the site-
      specific information below.
         15.3.2.1.1. Historical Information. Historical information, which is documented in a
         written report, is gathered through a records search, to include the permanent records
         outlined in section 5.2., and interviews. The following information is required:
             15.3.2.1.1.1. The boundaries of the response area. For munitions responses, the
             Munitions Response Area (MRA) boundaries and, when appropriate, the
             boundaries of any Munitions Response Sites (MRS) (e.g., firing points, impact
             areas, and burial sites) within the MRA are required.
             15.3.2.1.1.2. The type of MEC known or suspected to be present based on the
             types of munitions-related operations, training, or testing previously performed in
             the MRA or MRS.
             15.3.2.1.1.3. The type and configuration of any CA known or suspected to be
             present.
         15.3.2.1.2. Land Use. Land use is the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated
         future use of real property. Because portions of the response area (e.g., the MRA or
         MRS) might be used differently (e.g., public highway, wildlife refuge, sports field,
         industrial complex), different response actions (e.g., surface removal, subsurface
         removal, no removal, remedial response) may be appropriate within any given
         response area.
             15.3.2.1.2.1. Where the land use is limited to surface activities, the munitions or
             CWM response may only involve removing surface MEC or surface CA. This
             removal may be technology-aided.
             15.3.2.1.2.2. When the land use will involve or allow intrusive activities to occur,
             the response will normally require a subsurface removal, and may require follow-
             on construction support.
             15.3.2.1.2.3. Where the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated land use is
             compatible with the explosive or CA hazards present or suspected, a response
             action to remove any explosive or CA hazards may not be necessary.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    379


                15.3.2.1.2.4. Where a response would adversely impact natural or cultural
                resources, a removal action may not be practical.
          15.3.2.1.3. Results of Onsite Investigations. These results should be used to validate
          and augment information discovered during the historical review and to determine the
          specific boundaries of the response area (e.g., the boundary of an MRA or of any
          MRS within an MRA).
          15.3.2.1.4. Analysis. Conduct a detailed analysis of available records, technical data,
          and the results of onsite investigations. This analysis should evaluate:
                15.3.2.1.4.1. The types of MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, known to
                be present, to include its technical characteristics (e.g., filler, fuzing) and
                estimated distribution.
                15.3.2.1.4.2. The potential explosive or CA hazards present.
                15.3.2.1.4.3. Physical site characteristics (e.g., flora and fauna, endangered
                species, cultural items, geological, topographical, hydrological).
                15.3.2.1.4.4. People potentially endangered.
                15.3.2.1.4.5. Information from previous or current responses.
          15.3.2.1.5. LUC. Evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of LUC to manage
          any residual explosives safety or CA safety risks.
          15.3.2.1.6. Technology. Evaluate the applicability, capabilities, and limitations of
          available technologies (e.g., detection, discrimination, removal).
          15.3.2.1.7. Other relevant factors.

Section 15D—Special Considerations

15.4. General
   15.4.1. Explosive Soil
      15.4.1.1. Because of some past munitions-related activities (e.g., settling ponds or
      explosives sumps at munitions production or demilitarization facilities), concentrations of
      explosives in soil (e.g., sand, sludge, clay) can exist such that the mixture itself presents
      an explosive hazard. Such mixtures are referred to as ―explosive soil.‖
      15.4.1.2. The NEWQD of explosive soil is the weight of the mixture multiplied by the
      explosives concentration (e.g., 1,000 lbs [454 kg] of explosive soil that is 10 percent TNT
      has an NEWQD of 100 lbs [45.4 kg]).
      15.4.1.3. The concentration necessary to present an explosive hazard depends on the
      distribution and type of explosives in the soil and the soil’s characteristics.
          15.4.1.3.1. Primary (Initiating) Explosives
                15.4.1.3.1.1. Soil containing 2 percent or more by weight of any primary
                explosive or mixture of primary explosives presents an explosive hazard and shall
                be treated as HD 1.1.
380                                                        AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


             15.4.1.3.1.2. Soil containing less than 2 percent by weight of any primary
             explosive does not present an explosive hazard.
         15.4.1.3.2. Secondary Explosives.
             15.4.1.3.2.1. Secondary explosives are much less sensitive than primary
             explosives.
             15.4.1.3.2.2. Soil containing 10 percent or more of weight of either any
             secondary explosives or a mixture of secondary explosives presents an explosive
             hazard and shall be treated as HD 1.1.
             15.4.1.3.2.3. Soil containing less than 10 percent by weight of any secondary
             explosive or a mixture of secondary explosives does not present an explosive
             hazard.
         15.4.1.3.3. Nitroglycerin, Nitrocellulose, and Nitroguanidine
             15.4.1.3.3.1. Soil containing 10 percent or more by weight of nitroglycerine,
             nitrocellulose, or nitroguanidine presents an explosive hazard and shall be treated
             as HD 1.1.
             15.4.1.3.3.2. Soil containing less than 10 percent by weight of nitroglycerin,
             nitrocellulose, or nitroguanidine does not present an explosive hazard. (Care must
             be taken when applying this threshold rule to less-permeable soils, such as clay,
             that may cause nitroglycerin to pool, rather than be absorbed.)
         15.4.1.3.4. Other Energetic Materials Mixtures. The potential explosive hazard of
         such mixtures in soil may be unknown and may require testing. If the hazard is
         unknown, manage soil mixtures containing only propellants as secondary explosives,
         and all other soil mixtures containing energetics (e.g., liquid propellants) as primary
         explosives.
  15.4.2. Real Property (Buildings and Installed Equipment). Military munitions operating
  buildings (e.g., munitions production or demilitarization facilities) and any installed
  equipment may contain residual explosives that present an explosive hazard. Of particular
  concern are building features (e.g., floors, roofs, walls, drains, internal and external piping,
  ventilation systems) in which explosives residues could present explosive hazards and
  industrial equipment, particularly equipment with internal cavities from facilities used in
  munitions production or demilitarization operations (e.g., cast loading or milling, steam-out)
  that generated explosives residues (e.g., dust, vapors, liquids). To the extent such buildings or
  installed equipment is believed to present an explosive or CA hazard, installations, in
  coordination with MAJCOM and AFSC/SEW, must submit to the DDESB for use of such
  buildings and installed equipment before use or transfer for purpose incompatible with the
  presence of the explosive hazard (see DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, for additional
  information).
  15.4.3. Construction Support
      15.4.3.1. Responsible installations should consider the level of construction support
      required, based on site-specific data, during the below activities.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 381


        15.4.3.1.1. Intrusive activities (e.g., building construction, laying utilities, or road
        improvements) on property known or suspected to contain MEC or CA, regardless of
        CA configuration, or on property where residual explosive or CA hazards may exist.
        15.4.3.1.2. The removal or remediation of debris or media in areas where there is a
        probability of encountering MEC (e.g., former OB/OD grounds) or CA.
     15.4.3.2. The responsible authority (e.g., installation commander or designated
     representative) will determine whether such support is required and the level of effort of
     required support on a case-by-case basis (see subparagraph 15.5.7). Construction support
     is determined by the probability of encountering MEC or CA, regardless of CA
     configuration.
        15.4.3.2.1. Low Probability. ―On-call‖ construction support is appropriate
            15.4.3.2.1.1. A ―low‖ determination may only be assigned to those areas for
            which a search of available historical records and onsite investigation data
            indicates that, given the military or munitions-related activities that occurred at
            the site, the likelihood of encountering MEC or CA, regardless of CA
            configuration, is low.
            15.4.3.2.1.2. Munitions-related activities that may merit a ―low‖ determination
            include, but are not limited to, the former use of the area for live-fire training
            exclusively with small arms ammunition; for maneuver training, to include
            maneuver training involving the use of smokes, pyrotechnics, and simulators; as
            firing points; for munitions inspection, handling, storage, or transfers, to include
            residue points and inert storage yards; for air defense; or as munitions operating
            facilities. The exceptions are facilities in which the processes used might have
            resulted in the generation of concentrations of munitions constituents high enough
            to present an explosive hazard. Areas on which previous responses have been
            completed may also qualify for ―low‖ determinations.
            15.4.3.2.1.3. Immediate reassessment by the responsibility authority of the level
            of construction support required is appropriate upon the discovery of MEC or CA,
            regardless of CA configuration.
        15.4.3.2.2. Moderate to High Probability. ―Onsite‖ construction support should be
        provided to remove explosive or CA hazards in the construction footprint, per a
        DDESB-approved ESS or CSS, before intrusive construction or other intrusive
        activities occur. (NOTE: When the depth of intrusive activities exceeds the detection
        limits of the detection equipment used, soil should be removed in layers to allow
        detection and removal of MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, in the
        construction footprint.)
            15.4.3.2.2.1. A ―moderate to high‖ determination may be assigned to those areas
            for which a search of available historical records or onsite investigation data
            indicates that, given the military or munitions-related activities that occurred at
            the site, there is more than a low probability that MEC or CA are present.
            15.4.3.2.2.2. Munitions-related activities that may merit a ―moderate to high‖
            determination include, but are not limited to, the former use of the area for live-
382                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


             fire training other than exclusively with small arms ammunition; as operational
             range impact areas; for OB or OD of munitions; as munitions operating facilities
             where processes used might have resulted in the generation of concentrations of
             munitions constituents high enough to present an explosive hazard; for munitions
             burial; or for any activities involving CA.
  15.4.4. Anomaly Avoidance
      15.4.4.1. The use of anomaly avoidance techniques is appropriate on properties known
      or suspected to contain UXO or other munitions (e.g., Discarded Military Munitions
      (DMM)) that may have experienced abnormal environments to allow the below activities
      in such areas while avoiding surface explosive or CA hazards and, when necessary,
      subsurface anomalies. Anomaly avoidance is used when:
         15.4.4.1.1. Surface MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, will be avoided
         during any activities that require entry to the area (e.g., collections of environmental
         samples, the conduct of cultural resource studies).
         15.4.4.1.2. Subsurface anomalies will be avoided during any intrusive work (e.g.,
         drilling environmental monitory wells).
      15.4.4.2. During anomaly avoidance:
         15.4.4.2.1. Escort support must be provided by EOD personnel, or:
             15.4.4.2.1.1. Within areas known or suspected to contain MEC, excluding CA,
             regardless of configuration, by UXO-qualified personnel as outlined in DDESB
             TP 18.
             15.4.4.2.1.2. Within areas known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of
             configuration, to include areas where such CA is commingled with other MEC, by
             UXO-qualified personnel trained in CWM responses.
         15.4.4.2.2. Explosives safety requires that discovered surface MEC or CA, regardless
         of CA configuration, be avoided and their location noted and reported to appropriate
         authorities.
         15.4.4.2.3. Detected subsurface anomalies must not be investigated, but they shall be
         marked, when appropriate, and avoided.
  15.4.5. Frost Heave. This phenomenon occurs when three conditions are met: (a) freezing
  temperatures are present in the soil column; (b) the soil is frost susceptible; and (c) there is
  sufficient moisture present in the soil to cause soil movement upon ice crystal formation.
  These three factors will be evaluated to assess the likelihood of frost heave moving residual
  MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, upward through the soil column. Where frost
  heave may have such an effect, explosives safety requires procedures be implemented to
  monitor the effectiveness of response actions for the affected area. (Other naturally occurring
  phenomena (e.g., erosion, tidal changes) could necessitate similar monitoring.)
  15.4.6. Soil Containing CA
      15.4.6.1. The criteria below apply to soil known to be contaminated with one or more of
      the following CA: mustard, L, GD, GA/GB, O-cyclohexyl Methylphosphono-flouridate
      (GF) (common name is cylcosarin), or VX. This criteria applies only if a headspace
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    383


      measurement is at or above the Short Term Exposure Limits (STEL) (see subparagraph
      15.4.6.4.1.) or a laboratory extraction sample is at or above the Hazardous Waste Control
      Limit (HWCL) for solid materials: mustard, L, GD, GA/GB, GF, or VX. Certain CA-
      related operations, such as taking core samples at a suspect CWM or CA burial site,
      require laboratory extraction sampling.
      15.4.6.2. Soil for which no evidence exists of CA contamination does not require
      treatment or remediation.
      15.4.6.3. An appendix to the site’s Site Safety and Health Plan that addresses the
      procedures (e.g., personnel protection, monitoring, sampling, packaging, disposal) for the
      handling and disposition of CA-contaminated soil is required for environmental
      responses to soil known or suspected to be contaminated with CA.
      15.4.6.4. Air-sampling methods will be used to detect CA during CWM responses.
      When soil contaminated with CA is encountered and an air concentration is at or above
      the STEL based on off-gas monitoring of the headspace of a container or of air in the
      immediate area of the operation, appropriate personnel protective measures shall be
      employed and the CA-contaminated soil shall be decontaminated to below the HWCL
      levels of subparagraph 15.4.6.4.2. unless the CA-contaminated soil may be shipped per
      DOT regulations and approvals and a receiving Treatment Storage Disposal Facility
      (TSDF) is qualified to process the CA-contaminated soil per Federal, State, interstate,
      and local laws and regulations. If air monitoring is below the STEL, soil samples will be
      taken to determine if the soil exceeds the HWCL.
           15.4.6.4.1. The STELs for air sampling CA contamination are:
           15.4.6.4.1.1. 0.003 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for mustard (H, HD, or HT)
           agent.
           15.4.6.4.1.2. 0.003 mg/m3 for L.
           15.4.6.4.1.3. 0.0002 mg/m3 for GD/GF.
           15.4.6.4.1.4. 0.0001 mg/m3 for GA/GB.
           15.4.6.4.1.5. 0.00001 mg/m3 for VX.
           15.4.6.4.2. When soil contaminated with CA is encountered at or above the HWCL
           levels listed in Table 15.1. as determined by laboratory extraction and analysis of soil
           samples, the CA-contaminated soil shall be decontaminated to below the levels listed
           for HWCL, or to a level required by Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and
           regulations.

9004) when ammunition and explosives are present, or are suspected to be present, will be
submitted through command safety channels to AFSC/SEW, for submission to the DDESB for
review and approval.
   15.5.1. Explosives and CA safety requires:
       15.5.1.1. A DDESB-approved site plan, ESS, or CSS before the start of munitions
       response activities (e.g., field activities) that involve the placement of explosives on a
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  385


     site; the intentional physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration; or
     the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities in areas known or suspected
     to contain MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration; or
     15.5.1.2. An AFSC/SEW review and approval pending DDESB review and approval of
     the submission, provided the submission is at the DDESB for review and approval and
     the submitting MAJCOM understands that DDESB approval may impose different or
     additional munitions or CWM response requirements.
  15.5.2. A DDESB-approved ESS or CSS, or an explosives or CWM site plan, or a
  combination thereof, is required for:
     15.5.2.1. MRS investigation or characterization (e.g., Engineering Evaluation/Cost
     Analysis (EE/CA) or Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS)) that involve the
     intentional physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration (see
     subparagraph 15.5.4.).
     15.5.2.2. A determination of ―No DoD Action Indicated‖ (NDAI) or ―No Further
     Action‖ (NOFA) (see subparagraph 15.5.5).

     15.5.2.5. Execution of the explosives safety or CA safety aspects of the selected response
     (see subparagraphs 15.5.8. and 15.5.9).
  15.5.3. A DDESB-approved ESS or CSS, or an explosives or CWM site plan is not required
  for:
     15.5.3.1. Munitions or explosives emergency responses.
     15.5.3.2. Preliminary assessments or site inspections (e.g., site visits in conjunction with
     an archival search) when intentional physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA
     configuration, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities are not
     intended (see subparagraph 15.5.3.6.)
     15.5.3.3. Clearance activities on operational ranges. (Addressing military munitions
     burial sites on operational ranges is not a clearance activity.)
     15.5.3.4. Munitions responses on former ranges used exclusively for training with small
     arms ammunition.
     15.5.3.5. On-call construction support
     15.5.3.6. Anomaly avoidance activities
  15.5.4. MRS Investigation or Characterization. An explosives or, when appropriate, a CWM
  site plan is required for MRS investigations or characterizations that involve intentional
  physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration. Such site plans will
  address areas (e.g., magazines) used for the storage of commercial or military demolition
  explosives, MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration; planned or established demolition
  or disposal areas; and the MRA, MRS, or response area boundaries. (See subparagraph
  15.5.8.3.7.) MRS investigation and characterization are used to collect the information

      15.5.5.3. Justification for the decision.
  15.5.6. TCRA ESS or CSS. To expedite the approval process, installations are encouraged to
  submit TCRA ESS or CSS electronically through their chain of command to the DDESB. A
  TCRA ESS or CSS must, at a minimum, identify or provide:
      15.5.6.1. The site identification (e.g., name, unique identifier).
      15.5.6.2. The TCRA’s location.
      15.5.6.3. The TCRA’s purpose, in sufficient detail to explain the reason the TCRA was

             15.5.6.6.1.1. Unintentional detonations (see subparagraph 15.5.8.3.2.1.).
             15.5.6.6.1.2. Intentional detonations (see subparagraph 15.5.8.3.2.2.).
         15.5.6.6.2. Areas or magazines for the storage of demolition explosives, MEC, or
         CA, regardless of CA configuration.
      15.5.6.7. Actions and controls to be implemented (e.g., surface removal, evacuation,
      fences) as part of the TCRA.
      15.5.6.8. DDESB-approved engineering controls to be used, if any.
      15.5.6.9. A point of contact for additional information
  15.5.7. Construction support ESS or CSS. A safety submission is required for construction

  is considered moderately or highly probable. This submission must provide the information
  outlined in paragraphs 15.5.8. and 15.5.9., as appropriate. The information may be tailored
  based on site-specific conditions.
  15.5.8. Selected Munitions Response ESS. The information below is required in an ESS for
  the execution of the selected munitions response to address MEC. When CA, regardless of
  configuration, is known or suspected to be present a long with explosive hazards, or when it
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   387


  is explosively configured, a submission that provides both explosives safety (as outlines in
  this section) and CA safety information (see paragraph 15.5.9.) is required.
     15.5.8.1. Background. The ESS must provide, for informational purposes, a brief
     description of the reasons for the munitions response. The ESS must identify or provide:
         15.5.8.1.1. The scope of munitions response activities.
         15.5.8.1.2. Any significant differences in munitions response activities that will
         occur within the MRA or MRS. (NOTE: The ESS must identify significant
         differences in the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future land use of
         different sections of the property, significant differences in the types or conditions of
         MEC expected to be encountered, and any sections of the MRA that will not require
         munitions response activities.)
     15.5.8.2. Maps. The following maps and related information must be furnished:
         15.5.8.2.1. Regional Map. A map depicting the regional location of the MRA or
         MRS (e.g., a state or boundary illustration map with the MRA indicated on it).
         15.5.8.2.2. MRA or MRS Maps. Include maps of the area or areas at which the
         munitions response is planned. These maps and related information shall indicate:
             15.5.8.2.2.1. Areas that:
                15.5.8.2.2.1.1. Contain or are suspected of containing MEC that the ESS
                addresses
                15.5.8.2.2.1.2. Were suspected of containing MEC, but that research or site
                characterizations have subsequently shown do not contain such.
                15.5.8.2.2.1.3. The ESS does not address, but that either a previous safety
                submission addressed or a future safety submission will address.
             15.5.8.2.2.2. The current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future land use of
             property within the MRA or MRS that is known or suspected to contain MEC that
             the ESS addresses.
             15.5.8.2.2.3. The ownership and land use of adjacent properties, as appropriate.
             15.5.8.2.2.4. Any other situation that may influence or require consideration
             during the response (e.g., flight corridors, traffic routes).
     15.5.8.3. ESQD
         15.5.8.3.1. The planned locations for MEC response-related operations must be
         shown on Explosives Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) maps. (NOTE: Preliminary
         site work, such as surveying, laying search lanes, and detecting anomalies does not
         require establishment of an ESQD arc.)
         15.5.8.3.2. ESQD arcs for both intentional and unintentional detonations must be
         established and shown on ESQD maps for each MRS.
             15.5.8.3.2.1. The Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) for unintentional
             detonations, which may be reduced by employing DDESB-approved engineering
             controls, for:
388                                                    AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


             15.5.8.3.2.1.1. Nonessential personnel is the greatest distance of:
               15.5.8.3.2.1.1.1. Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D =
               40W1/3 .
               15.5.8.3.2.1.1.2. The calculated HFD.
             15.5.8.3.2.1.2. Team Separation distance (TSD) is             based on blast
             overpressure, as computed by the formula: D = 40W1/3.
         15.5.8.3.2.2. The MSD for intentional detonations (see Chapter 12), which may
         be reduced by employing DDESB-approved engineering controls, is the greatest
         distance of:
             15.5.8.3.2.2.1. Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D =
             328W1/3.
             15.5.8.3.2.2.2. The calculated Maximum Fragment Distance (MFD) (see
             chapter 12).
      15.5.8.3.3. MEC, Excluding CA-filled Munitions, Hazard Classification, and Storage
         15.5.8.3.3.1. Recovered MEC, other than Recovered CWM (RCWM), shall be
         managed as HD 1.1, unless assigned differently by an Interim Hazard
         Classification (IHC) authority, and assigned an appropriate CG. When storage at
         the MRA or MRS is necessary, recovered MEC must be stored separately from
         serviceable munitions and from any RCWM. (NOTE: For RCWM, see
         subparagraph 15.5.9.6.)
         15.5.8.3.3.2. Nonessential personnel in structures shall be afforded protection
         equivalent to IBD from storage locations. Nonessential personnel in the open shall
         be afforded protection equivalent to Public Traffic Route Distance (PTRD) from
         storage locations. (See Chapter 12.) There is no required ESQD protection for
         essential personnel from locations they are using for storage.
         15.5.8.3.3.3. The Intermagazine Distance (IMD), based on the Net Explosive
         Weight Quantity Distance (NEWQD) of the munition with the greatest NEWQD
         that is reasonably expected to be encountered, applies from intrusive operations to
         storage sites to prevent propagation to a storage location in event of an accidental
         explosion during intrusive operations. For distances less than IMD, DDESB-
         approved engineering controls must be used during intrusive operations.
      15.5.8.3.4. Planned or Established Demolition Areas. A planned or established
      demolition area is an area used repetitively to destroy munitions during a munitions
      response. (Such areas may be an existing OD area or a new area planned for
      intentional detonation.) An ESQD arc must be provided around demolition areas.
      The size of the ESQD arc will be based on requirements of this Manual (see Chapter
      12).
      15.5.8.3.5. Mechanized MEC Processing Operations, Excluding CA-filled Munitions
         15.5.8.3.5.1. These processing operations can be classified as either ―high input‖
         or ―low input‖ based on a risk assessment that considers the degree of energy with
         which the process would impact any MEC potentially processed.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                             389


              15.5.8.3.5.1.1. High-input processing operations (e.g., shredders, crushers)
              are intended to physically deform material including any MEC being
              processed, and certain excavations depending upon the risk assessment.
              15.5.8.3.5.1.2. Low-input processing operations (e.g., on-site transport,
              dumping, screening, raking, spreading, sifting, and magnetically separating)
              are not intended to intentionally deform material including MEC being
              processed, and certain excavations depending upon the risk assessment.
          15.5.8.3.5.2. Personnel Separation Distances
              15.5.8.3.5.2.1. Nonessential Personnel.
               15.5.8.3.5.2.1.1. During high-input processing operations, nonessential
               personnel shall be provided protection for intentional detonations (see
               subparagraph 15.5.8.3.2.2.) based on the MGFD.
               15.5.8.3.5.2.1.2. During low-input processing operations, nonessential
               personnel shall be provided protection for accidental (unintentional)
               detonations (greater of HFD or K40).
          15.5.8.3.5.3. Essential Personnel. For both high- and low-input processing
          operations, essential personnel shall:
              15.5.8.3.5.3.1. Be protected by shields or barricades designed to defeat
              hazardous fragments from the MGFD.
              15.5.8.3.5.3.2. Be separated from the operation by K24 based on the munition
              with the greatest NEWQD that is reasonably expected to be encountered.
              (NOTE: DDESB-approved overpressure-mitigating engineering controls may
              be used to provide an equivalent level of protection (2.3 psi) [15.9 kPa]).
       15.5.8.3.6. Intentional Burning of Buildings Contaminated with Explosives Residues
       that Present an Explosive Hazard. All personnel shall be separated by K328
       overpressure distance based on the Maximum Credible Event (MCE) for the building,
       but not less than 1,250 feet.
       15.5.8.3.7. ESQD Maps. (NOTE: The ESQD arcs and the MRA and MRS
       boundaries may be shown on the same map provided all PES and ES are shown in
       sufficient detail.)
          15.5.8.3.7.1. ESQD-maps should be to scale and legible per subparagraph
          14.24.2.
          15.5.8.3.7.2. When a map does not contain a scale, all distances must be labeled.
          15.5.8.3.7.3. The ESQD map shall show the following:
              15.5.8.3.7.3.1. Each MRA or MRS.
              15.5.8.3.7.3.2. The storage locations for demolition explosives and for
              recovered MEC.
              15.5.8.3.7.3.3. Locations (planned or established) for the intentional
              detonations or burning of MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions. Such
390                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


                 locations include areas where contained detonation technology will be used.
                 15.5.8.3.7.3.4. All ES and PES and their relationships. (NOTE: Describe any
                 protective measures (e.g., evacuation of inhabited buildings, blocking off
                 public highways) that will be used to eliminate or minimize any exposures
                 within the established exclusion zone.)
                 15.5.8.3.7.3.5. All controlling ESQD arcs.
             15.5.8.3.7.4. ESQD Arcs. ESQD arcs must be shown for:
                 15.5.8.3.7.4.1. Munitions. The MGFD shall be used for ESQD purposes for
                 any particular MRA or MRS. However, if a munition with a greater
                 fragmentation distance is encountered during the conduct of a munitions
                 response, the ESQD arcs must be adjusted and the ESS or explosives safety
                 site plan must be amended.
                 15.5.8.3.7.4.2. Explosive Soil. To determine the ESQD arc for explosive
                 soil, calculate the MCE by multiplying the weight of the mix by the
                 concentration of explosives (e.g., 1,000 lb of soil containing 15 percent TNT
                 has an MCE of 150 lb). When concentrations vary within the site, weighted
                 averages or other valid mathematical technique can be used to determine the
                 exclusion zone; however, the ESS must support their use. The MSD for
                 nonessential personnel shall be the greater of IBD for overpressure or the soil
                 ejecta radius per DDESB-approved procedures.
                 15.5.8.3.7.4.3. Real Property (Buildings and Installed Equipment). For
                 real property that is known or suspected to be contaminated with explosives
                 residues that present an explosive hazard, and that is slated for cleanup or
                 dismantlement, the MCE will be estimated on a case-by-case basis. The ESS
                 shall include the rationale used for the estimation.
         15.5.8.3.8. Soil Sampling Maps. When the property involves concentrations of
         explosives in the soil that are high enough to present an explosive hazard (see
         subparagraph 15.4.1.):
             15.5.8.3.8.1. Provide a map that indicates areas that were determined to contain
             explosive soil.
             15.5.8.3.8.2. Address methods (e.g., blending, bio-remediation) to be used to
             reduce explosives concentrations to a non-reactive level.
             15.5.8.3.8.3. Address methods (e.g., wetting the soil before blending) to be used
             to reduce any explosive hazards.
      15.5.8.4. Types of MEC. Based on research or data generated from characterization of
      the MRA or MRs, provide the types of MEC expected to be encountered during
      munitions response activities.
      15.5.8.5. Start Date. Provide the expected date that munitions response activities that
      involve the placement of explosives on a site, the intentional physical contact with MEC,
      or the conduct of ground-disturbing or intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to
      contain MEC are scheduled to start. Indicate the potential consequence, if any, if
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  391


     DDESB approval does not occur by the start date. (Site preparation activities (e.g.,
     surveying, gridding, or locating anomalies) may be conducted while awaiting DDESB
     approval of ESS.)
     15.5.8.6. MEC Migration. Describe naturally occurring phenomena (e.g., drought,
     flooding, erosion, frost heave, tidal changes) that could cause the migration or exposure
     of MEC, and procedures for monitoring and managing such.
     15.5.8.7. Detection Equipment and Response Techniques. The intent of this section is
     to describe the capabilities of detection equipment relative to the degree of removal
     required to support the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated end use.
        15.5.8.7.1. Describe the techniques to be used to detect and remove MEC.
        15.5.8.7.2. Identify the types of detection equipment to be used and the areas in
        which they will be employed.
        15.5.8.7.3. Summarize methods used (e.g., test plots) to establish the expected
        detection capabilities of the equipment used. If anomaly discrimination will be used,
        explain what methods will be sued to establish the expected accuracy of the
        discrimination.
        15.5.8.7.4. When describing the detection methods:
            15.5.8.7.4.1. Describe the rationale (e.g., best available technology based on
            geology, topography, munitions characteristics, resource requirements) used to
            select the detection methods and technologies to be used during the response.
            15.5.8.7.4.2. Address any limitations (e.g., equipment, terrain, soil type) and
            mitigating actions, if any.
            15.5.8.7.4.3. Describe quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) standards
            and pass or fail criteria for QA/QC control audits.
     15.5.8.8. Disposition Techniques
        15.5.8.8.1. MEC, Excluding CA-Filled Munitions
            15.5.8.8.1.1. Briefly, describe the MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions,
            disposition techniques (e.g., OB, OD, contained detonation, incineration) to be
            used.
            15.5.8.8.1.2. When recovered MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions, cannot be
            destroyed within the MRA or MRS, address how explosives safety requirements
            will be met during transportation and during offsite storage, treatment, or
            disposal. (NOTE: disposition actions should consider requirements applicable to
            waste military munitions.)
        15.5.8.8.2. Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). Describe
        the process to be used to manage MPPEH (see DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, Enclosure
        6).
     15.5.8.9. Environmental, Ecological, Cultural and Other Considerations. Address any
     environmental, ecological (e.g., endangered species), cultural (e.g., archaeological, tribal
392                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


      spiritual or gathering sites) and other factors that impacted, from an explosives safety
      perspective, the selection of the munitions response.
      15.5.8.10. Technical Support. Summarize EOD, U.S. Army Forces Command/20th
      Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion, or UXO-technician or UXO-qualified
      personnel support that may be required. (NOTE: U.S. Army Forces Command/20th
      Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion is manned with specially trained personnel
      that provide verification, sampling, detection, mitigation, render safe, decontamination,
      packaging, escort, and remediation of chemical, biological and industrial devices or
      hazardous materials.)
      15.5.8.11. Residual Risk Management. Address:
         15.5.8.11.1. LUC. The ESS must summarize any LUC to be implemented and
         maintained on the property.
         15.5.8.11.2. Long-Term Management. The ESS must address how any potential
         residual risks will be managed.
      15.5.8.12. Safety Education Program. Address methods to be used to educate the
      public on the risks associated with MEC and CA, regardless of CA configuration.
      15.5.8.13. Stakeholder Involvement. Briefly, summarize how stakeholder concerns
      affecting the explosives safety aspects of the selected munitions response were addressed.
      15.5.8.14. Contingencies. To reduce the need to submit amendments (see subparagraph
      15.6.1.), an ESS may describe alternative actions that could be used to address
      contingencies. As an example, an ESS may list alternative DDESB-approved
      engineering controls that may be used under specified conditions.
      15.5.8.15. Unexpected CA Discoveries. Should CA, regardless of its configuration, be
      discovered during munitions responses to MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions, all onsite
      activities shall be halted until the need for a CWM response is evaluated and a decision is
      approved by the Service-level explosives safety office. If it is decided that a CWM
      response is necessary, response actions that involve the intentional physical contact with
      CA, regardless of configuration, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive
      activities in areas known or suspected to contain CA shall not begin until the required
      CSS or CWM site plan is approved by the DDESB.
  15.5.9. Selected CWM Response CSS and CWM Site Plans
      15.5.9.1. General
         15.5.9.1.1. A response in an area (e.g., a munitions response in an MRA or MRS)
         that is known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of configuration, must include a
         CWM site plan for an Interim Holding Facility (IHF) and, when the use of onsite
         destruction technology is planned, for the site at which those destruction activities
         will occur. Generally, the information required in CSS parallels that for an ESS (see
         subparagraph 15.5.8); however, such information will be tailored to address CWM.
         15.5.9.1.2. A CSS is not required for certain activities on a site with a history of CA-
         related activities when an installation or district commander, or a command-
         designated representative, has approved a probability assessment finding for such
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                393


        activities stating that the probability of discovering CA is expected to be ―seldom‖ or
        ―unlikely.‖ However, the site safety and health plan must include contingency plans
        providing for the safe and expeditious evacuation of the site in the event CA is
        discovered. Should CA, regardless of configuration, be discovered during these
        activities, all onsite activities shall be halted until the need for a CWM response is
        evaluated and a decision is approved by the Service-level explosives safety office. If
        it is decided that a CWM response is necessary, response actions that involve the
        intentional physical contact with CA, regardless of configuration, and/or the conduct
        of ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to
        contain CA shall not begin until the required CSS or CWM site plan is approved by
        the DDESB.
     15.5.9.2. Explosives Hazards. When explosives hazards are known or suspected to
     exist along with CA hazards within a response area (e.g., the MRA or MRS), a
     submission that addresses both explosives safety (see subparagraph 15.5.8) and CA
     safety (as outlined in this section) is required.
     15.5.9.3. Background. (see subparagraph 15.5.8.1)
     15.5.9.4. Maps. The maps provided with a CSS must meet the requirements of
     subparagraph 15.5.8.2. In addition, the One Percent Lethality Distance and the IBD shall
     be shown.
     15.5.9.5. Chemical Agent Hazards. When CA hazards are known or suspected to exist
     within a response area (e.g., the MRA or MRS), the CA downwind hazard must be
     considered when determining the MSD. The CSS shall provide the following
     information:
        15.5.9.5.1. A description of the CA MCE.
        15.5.9.5.2. A description of how essential and nonessential personnel and the public
        will be protected should the CA MCE occur (see DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 6) for
        basic personnel protection requirements (e.g., hazard zones and protective equipment)
        for operations involving CWM). If an Engineering Control (EC), which has not been
        DDESB-approved, is to be used to provide such protection, the CSS must include the
        technical data substantiating the new engineering control’s effectiveness. EC may be
        used for:
            15.5.9.5.2.1. Protection from overpressure and fragments when explosively
            configured CWM are known or suspected.
            15.5.9.5.2.2. Protection from CA effects (prevent vapor releases to the
            environment) during both response activities and when RCWM is stored in the
            IHF.
     15.5.9.6. RCWM Hazard Classification and Storage
        15.5.9.6.1. RCWM, suspected or confirmed, regardless of its configuration, must be
        stored separately from serviceable munitions and from other MEC. Additionally,
        suspect RCWM shall be stored separately from all other munitions and from RCWM.
        15.5.9.6.2. Suspect and known RCWM shall be managed as HD 1.1 until stowed in
        an approved overpack container or until determined not to be RCWM (see
394                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


         subparagraph 15.5.8.3.3) or to be non-explosively configured RCWM (see
         subparagraph 15.5.9.6.4.). (NOTE: The CA downwind hazard must be considered,
         with the greater of the two distances used for siting purposes.)
         15.5.9.6.3. Explosively-configured RCWM in an approve overpack container shall
         be managed as HD 1.2.1. with an explosive MCE of one round or HD 1.2.2, based on
         its NEWQD. Such storage may be considered HD 1.1 if advantageous for computing
         HFD using DDESB-approved procedures. (The CA downwind hazard must be
         considered, with the longer of the two distances used for siting purposes.)
         15.5.9.6.4. Non-explosively configured RCWM shall be managed as HD 6.1. (The
         CA downwind hazard must be used for siting purposes.)
      15.5.9.7. CWM Site Plan. A DDESB-approved CWM Site Plan for an IHF is required
      when CA, regardless of configuration, is known or suspected to exist on a response area.
      The IHF Site Plan, which is based on the worst-case CA configuration expected to be
      encountered, is included in the CSS. The IHF site plan shall:
         15.5.9.7.1. Identify the public access exclusion distance (PAED).
         15.5.9.7.2. Identify all associated ESQD arcs (see subparagraph 15.5.8.3.).
         15.5.9.7.3. Address the evacuation procedures for personnel within the PAED.
         15.5.9.7.4. Address any security measures and access controls for the IHF.
         15.5.9.7.5. Address any EC that will be used to mitigate a CA release during IHF
         activities, such as:
             15.5.9.7.5.1. Static storage within the IHF.
             15.5.9.7.5.2. RCWM assessment activities (e.g., X-ray, portable isotopic neutron
             spectroscopy (PINS)).
             15.5.9.7.5.3. Transportation preparation activities (e.g., transloading of multiple
             round containers (MRCs), MRC movement into or out of the IHF).
         15.5.9.7.6. Address soil sampling maps. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.3.8.).
         15.5.9.7.7. Address types of CA. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.4.).
         15.5.9.7.8. Address start date. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.5.).
      15.5.9.8. Detection Equipment and Response Techniques. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.7)
      15.5.9.9. Disposition Techniques
         15.5.9.9.1. CA, Regardless of Configuration
             15.5.9.9.1.1. Briefly, describe the disposition techniques (e.g., onsite destruction)
             to be used.
             15.5.9.9.1.2. When RCWM cannot be destroyed on site, address how CA safety
             and, if applicable, explosives safety requirements, will be met during
             transportation and during offsite storage, treatment or disposal. (Disposition
             actions should consider guidance applicable to waste military munitions.)
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 395


          15.5.9.9.2. MPPEH. Describe the process to be used to manage MPPEH. (see DoD
          6055.09-M, Volume 7, Enclosure 6.)
      15.5.9.10. Environmental, Ecological, Cultural, and Other Considerations. (See
      subparagraph 15.5.8.9.).
      15.5.9.11. Technical Support. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.10).
      15.5.9.12. Residual Risk Management. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.11).
      15.5.9.13. Safety Education Program. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.12).
      15.5.9.14. Contingencies. (See subparagraph 15.5.8.14).
      15.5.9.15. Unexpected MEC or Explosively Configured CWM Discoveries. Should
      unexpected MEC or explosively configured CWM be discovered during a CWM
      response, all onsite activities that involve intentional physical contact with such MEC or
      explosively configured CWM, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive
      activities in areas known or suspected to contain such MEC or explosively configured
      CWM, shall be halted until the newly identified explosive hazards are evaluated and the
      DDESB approves all required CSS amendments or explosive site plans.

Section 15F—Amendments and Corrections

15.6. General. An amendment or correction to an approved ESS or CSS does not require the
resubmission of the complete ESS or CSS package. However, the information submitted must
be in sufficient detail to identify the specific ESS or CSS being amended or corrected, the
affected portions, and the precise amendments or corrections.
   15.6.1. Amendments. Amendments are only required when a change to an approved ESS
   or CSS increases explosives safety or CA risks, identifies requirements for additional or
   increased explosive or CA hazard controls, or increases or decreases an ESQD arc.
      15.6.1.1. An amendment requires DDESB approval before the affected response actions
      can continue. However, response actions need not be stopped pending such approval
      provided:
          15.6.1.1.1. The amendment pertains to an area (e.g., MRA or MRS) for which an
          ESS or CSS has already been approved; and,
          15.6.1.1.2. The MAJCOM, in coordination with AFSC/SEW:
              15.6.1.1.2.1. Institutes protective measures (e.g., increased ESQD, use of
              DDESB-approved EC) to address any explosive or CA hazards.
              15.6.1.1.2.2. Accepts the possibility that the DDESB approval process may
              impose different or additional explosives safety or CA safety requirements.
      15.6.1.2. If the amendment is for a new response area (e.g., a new MRS), then the
      DDESB must approve the amendment before intrusive activities begin in the new
      response area.
      15.6.1.3. To allow the response to continue with minimal interruption, amendments
      should be processed by electronic means.
 396                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       15.6.1.4. Changes that require an amendment include:
          15.6.1.4.1. Constraints in funding, technology, access, and other site-specific
          conditions that impact the degree of removal addressed in the approved ESS or CSS.
          15.6.1.4.2. Any increase or decrease of the ESQD arcs.
          15.6.1.4.3. A change in operations requiring explosives siting or re-siting of an IHF
          for CWM.
          15.6.1.4.4. Changes in LUC or long-term management to address residual risks.
          Such changes would not require intrusive activities to stop while the amendment is
          being processed.
   15.6.2. Corrections. Corrections address changes to an approved ESS or CSS that do not
   increase explosives safety or CA risks or exposures. Corrections:
       15.6.2.1. Do not require approval.
       15.6.2.2. Are primarily administrative in nature and provided for information purposes.

Section 15G—After Action Reports (AAR)

15.7. General
   15.7.1. An AAR for completed munitions or CWM responses is a required feature of all
   DDESB-approved ESS or CSS. The ARR’s purpose is to document that the explosives and
   chemical safety aspects of the selected response have been completed per the approved ESS
   or CSS. In most cases, a ―Statement of MEC Removal‖ or ―Statement of Munitions
   Response MEC Removal Actions‖ fulfills the requirements in subparagraph 15.7.2. The
   DDESB Staff shall acknowledge receipt of an AAR, and raise any issues that require
   resolution before land transfer or an alternative use can safely proceed.
   15.7.2. The AAR:
       15.7.2.1. Shall be submitted through command channels to the DDESB.
       15.7.2.2. May be submitted electronically.
       15.7.2.3. Will remain part of the DDESB’s action file; however, installations will
       continue to be responsible for complying with all recordkeeping requirements.
       15.7.2.4. Shall summarize the MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, found.
       15.7.2.5. Shall describe the relative effectiveness and any limitations of the technologies
       used during the munitions response or CWM response and the effects on residual risk
       relative to that originally projected.
       15.7.2.6. Shall include maps showing:
          15.7.2.6.1. Areas from which MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, was
          removed.
          15.7.2.6.2. Areas within a response area (e.g., within an MRA or MRS) where
          response actions were not performed and the rationale for not addressing those areas.
          15.7.2.6.3. The known or reasonably anticipated end use of each area.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   397


       15.7.2.7. Shall summarize the LUC that were implemented, if any, and the areas to
       which they apply.
       15.7.2.8. Shall address provisions for long-term management.

Section 15H—Transfer of Real Property Outside DoD Control

15.8. General. AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, which is managed by the Air Force
Real Property Agency (AFRPA), addresses contaminated real property. Activities associated
with the disposal of contaminated real property should be coordinated with the installation civil
engineer’s real estate division representative. Whenever disposal is contemplated, an
Environmental Baseline Survey must be conducted to identify any hazardous conditions
associated with the subject property, including unexploded ordnance and other hazardous
materials. Pursuant to DoD guidance on real property disposal, real property known to contain or
suspected of containing explosive CA hazards may not be transferred out of DoD control (other
than to the Coast Guard) until the Chairman, DDESB, has approved measures submitted by the
transferring Component to ensure the recipient of the property is fully informed of both the
actual and potential hazards relating to the presence or possible presence of explosives or CA,
and restrictions or conditions placed on the use of the property to avoid harm to users due to the
presence of explosives or CA.
   15.8.1. Notices. A recipient of such DoD property shall be provided:
       15.8.1.1. Details of any past removal or remedial actions, including:
           15.8.1.1.1. The degree of MEC or CA removal.
           15.8.1.1.2. The process used to determine that degree of removal to be adequately
           protective.
       15.8.1.2. Written notification that detection and removal methods are not 100 percent
       effective, and that residual hazards may remain in areas (e.g., MRS) that were subjected
       to response actions.
   15.8.2. Restrictions and Conditions. Based on potential explosive and CA hazards present
   and the projected use of the property, the following types of use restrictions and conditions
   shall be imposed, as appropriate, on such DoD property:
       15.8.2.1. A prohibition on excavation or drilling in any areas known or suspected to
       contain MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, without appropriate permits or
       assistance.
       15.8.2.2. A prohibition on disturbing, removing, or destroying any found MEC or CA,
       regardless of CA configuration.
       15.8.2.3. A requirement to immediately notify local law enforcement representatives of
       any discovery of MEC or CA, regardless of configuration.
       15.8.2.4. A prohibition on the construction or installation of particular improvements

                                          Chapter 16

     SPECIAL STORAGE PROCEDURES FOR WASTE MILITARY MUNITIONS

Section 16A—Scope and Applicability

16.1. Scope and Applicability.
      16.1.1. As referenced in DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, the Environmental Protection
      Agency (EPA) promulgated the Munitions Rule (MR), Subpart M of Part 266, title 40,
      CFR to define when chemical and conventional military munitions become hazardous
      waste and to provide for the safe storage and transportation of such waste. The MR takes
      precedence over these standards and sets forth two approaches for the storage of waste
      military munitions:
      16.1.1.1. A Conditional Exemption (CE) from certain ―Resource Conservation and
      Recovery Act (RCRA)‖ requirements.
      16.1.1.2. A new RCRA storage unit standard (i.e., Subpart EE, of Parts 264 and 265 of
      40 CFR).
   16.1.2. This chapter establishes additional requirements for storage of waste military
   munitions.

Section 16B—General

16.2. General.
   16.2.1. A military munition is a ―waste‖ if it is a solid or hazardous waste under regulations
   implementing the RCRA, (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq). In general:
      16.2.1.1. An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs:
          16.2.1.1.1. The munition is abandoned by being disposed of, burned, detonated
          (except during intended use), incinerated, or treated prior to disposal; or
          16.2.1.1.2. The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other
          storage area for the purpose of being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or treated
          prior to disposal, or
          16.2.1.1.3. The munition is deteriorated or damaged (e.g., the integrity of the
          munition is compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot
          be put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other
          purposes; or
          16.2.1.1.4. An authorized military official has declared the munition a solid waste.
      16.2.1.2. A used or fired military munition is a solid waste:
          16.2.1.2.1. When transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is
          not a range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment
          prior to disposal; or
 400                                                       AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


          16.2.1.2.2. If recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or landfilling
          either on or off a range.
       16.2.1.3. For purposes of RCRA section 1004(27), a used or fired military munition is a
       solid waste, and, therefore, is potentially subject to RCRA corrective action authorities
       under section 3004(u) and (v), and section 3008 (h), or imminent and substantial
       endangerment authorities under section 7003, if the munition lands off-range and is not
       promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved. Any imminent and substantial threats associated
       with any remaining material must be addressed. If remedial action is not feasible, the
       operator of the range must maintain a record of the event for as long as any threat
       remains. The record must include the type of munition and its location (to the extent the
       location is known). For further clarification see 40 CFR §266.202 under Definition of
       Solid Waste.

Section 16C—Waivers and Exemptions

16.3. Waivers and Exemptions.
   16.3.1. CE Storage. Waivers and exemptions from this standard are not authorized for AE
   storage facilities storing CE waste military munitions.
   16.3.2. RCRA Storage. Waivers and exemptions from this Standard will only be available
   to units storing waste munitions under RCRA unit standards (e.g., Subpart EE of Part 264 of
   40 CFR). The approval level for all waivers/exemptions is the Secretary of the Air Force.
   Approval may be delegated no lower than the assistant secretary.

Section 16D—Storage Requirements

16.4. Requirements for Storage of Waste Military Munitions Under CE.
   16.4.1. Installations storing waste military munitions under CE must comply with 40 CFR
   §266.205(a). (Note: The MR-established CE does not apply to chemical agents or toxic
   chemical munitions.)
   16.4.2. Each installation shall maintain records, for a minimum of 3 years from the last day
   the waste munitions were stored describing:
       16.4.2.1. The type of waste military munitions stored by standard nomenclature, Lot
       Number, Federal Supply Class (FSC), National Stock Number (NSN), Department of
       Defense Ammunition Code (DODAC), condition code, and quantity of each type waste
       military munitions stored. A separate record or line item is required for each type of
       munition in any mixed lot of munitions received for storage.
       16.4.2.2. The date that each military munitions, by type, was identified as waste.
       16.4.2.3. The last storage date for each, by type, waste military munitions.
       16.4.2.4. The storage location or locations (e.g., building number or storage pad, and grid
       coordinates) used.
       16.4.2.5. The disposition (e.g., destroyed, demilitarized, shipped) and date of action, by
       type of waste munitions.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    401


      16.4.2.6. When applicable, the sending and receiving sites for those waste military
      munitions received from or shipped to off-site sources.
   16.4.3. Physically separate (e.g., on a separate pallet or shelf, etc.) waste military munitions
   from non-waste military munitions when both are stored in the same AE storage facility.
   16.4.4. Clearly mark the segregated waste military munitions to ensure proper identification.
   16.4.5. Store waste munitions under CE in AE storage facilities that comply (without waiver
   or exemption) with the provisions of this standard. Each AE storage facility storing waste
   military munitions or explosives under CE must be included in a DDESB-approved
   explosives safety site plan that the installation keeps on file. Those portions of the site plan
   addressing AE storage facilities storing waste military munitions under CE shall be made
   available to appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authority upon request.
   16.4.6. Installations shall develop local operating instructions or plans that are designed to
   provide safety, security, and environmental protection. These plans will be coordinated with
   the appropriate Federal, State, and Local emergency response authorities (e.g., law
   enforcement, fire departments, hospitals, and etc.) and established planning committees.

Section 16E—Loss of CE

16.5. Loss of CE.
   16.5.1. The unpermitted or uncontrolled detonation, release, discharge, or migration (e.g.,
   loss or theft, or as a result of fire or explosion, etc.) of waste military munitions out of any
   storage unit that might endanger human health or the environment will result in the
   immediate loss of CE for those waste military munitions. Incidents of this nature and the loss
   of CE require reporting per paragraph 16.7.
   16.5.2. The appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authorities may withdraw
   CE based on review or inspection of the installation’s or responsible activity’s compliance
   with the requirements for storage of waste military munitions under CE. The Air Force
   Safety Center (AFSC) may, at any time, restrict an activity from using CE. In addition, the
   DDESB or AFSC, upon discovery of a condition that could warrant loss of CE, will report
   the condition to the commander of the installation or responsible activity.
   16.5.3. If CE is lost, the waste military munitions are subject to other RCRA hazardous
   waste regulations. The installation or responsible activities must obtain any required RCRA
   permits because of the loss of CE.
   16.5.4. Installations and responsible activities may apply for reinstatement of CE per 40
   CFR §266.205(c).
16.6. Other Storage Standards.
   16.6.1. Many States regulate waste management activities, including the storage of waste
   military munitions. In the event such State regulations conflict with Air Force Explosives
   Safety Standards, the AFSC will attempt to resolve the conflict. For those issues that cannot
   be resolved, AFSC will notify the DDESB of any irreconcilable conflict of State law,
   regulation, or directive with these or other DoD or Air Force explosives safety standards. The
   Chairman, DDESB, will review the law, regulation, or directive for any potential impact on
 402                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   explosives safety and will assist AFSC, in coordination with the Deputy Under Secretary of
   Defense (Installations and Environment) (DUSD{IE}), in resolving such regulatory conflicts.
   Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the component’s right to seek review of the State law,
   regulation, or directive in a court of competent jurisdiction.
16.7. Un-Permitted and Uncontrolled Loss Reporting. In addition to other applicable
reporting requirements, installations and responsible activities will notify AFSC/SEW (through
MAJCOM), the appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authority in accordance
with 40 CFR 266.205(a)(1)(v), and established local committees as follows:
   16.7.1. Telephonically or electronically (by e-mail message or facsimile) within 24 hours
   from the time the installation or responsible activity becomes aware of any unpermitted or
   uncontrolled detonation, release, discharge, or migration of waste military munitions out of
   any storage unit (e.g., loss or theft, or as a result of fire or explosion, etc.) that may endanger
   human health or the environment.
   16.7.2. In writing, if the initial report was telephonic, within 5 days from the time the
   installation or responsible activity becomes aware of any unpermitted or uncontrolled
   detonation, release, discharge, or migration of waste military munitions out of any AE
   storage facility (e.g., loss or theft, or as a result of fire or explosion, etc.) that may endanger
   human health or the environment. Follow-up reports to AFSC/SEW are only required when
   pertinent information, which was not previously reported, becomes known.

Section 16F—Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Munitions

16.8. Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Munitions Under CE.
   16.8.1. When an AE storage facility storing waste military munitions under CE is
   permanently taken out of service for the storage of non-waste and waste military munitions,
   installations and responsible activities will ensure that such facilities are appropriately closed.
   16.8.2. Installations or responsible activities must notify the appropriate Federal or State
   environmental regulatory authority in writing at least 45 days before closure activities begin.
   Initiation of these closure procedures should occur within 180 days after the date the decision
   is made to permanently stop using the facility for the storage of waste military munitions.
   16.8.3. Upon completion of closure activities, a ―certification of closure,‖ signed by the
   installation or responsible activity commander, or other equivalent level authority, and by an
   independent (i.e., an individual not assigned within the commander’s or equivalent-level
   authority’s chain of command) registered professional engineer must be submitted to the
   appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authority within 90 days of completing
   the closure activities, or by applicable law.
   16.8.4. The certificate of closure must state, at a minimum, that each of the explosives safety
   requirements in Chapter 15 have been met and that waste military munitions and residues are
   removed in such a manner as to protect the public and the environment consistent with the
   planned use of the storage facility and of the property.
   16.8.5. If closure certification cannot be rendered, the installation or responsible activity
   must contact the appropriate Federal and State environmental regulatory agency to determine
   the appropriate course of action.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                 403


16.9. Discontinuance of use for the Storage of Waste Munitions. When an AE storage
facility storing waste military munitions under CE is permanently taken out of service for the
storage of waste military munitions but is to continue in service for the storage of non-waste
military munitions, installations and responsible activities will ensure that waste military
munitions and residues are removed.
16.10. Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Military Munitions Under RCRA. In addition to
those explosives safety requirements in Chapter 15, closure procedures for those sites operating
under existing RCRA permits will follow those closure requirements stipulated in the respective
permit.
 404                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


                                          Chapter 17

                            UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO)

Section 17A—Introduction

17.1. This chapter establishes standards to protect personnel and property from explosive
and chemical agent (CA) hazards associated with UXO or other military munitions, to
include discarded military munitions (DMM), that have experienced abnormal
environments. This chapter’s standards do not apply during contingencies, combat operations,
and military operations other than war; however, these explosives safety principles should
always be considered in such circumstances and applied as the situation allows.
17.2. General
   17.2.1. UXO is considered the most dangerous category of military munitions. However,
   other military munitions, to include DMM, that are encountered outside the Department of
   Defense’s munitions logistics management system, particularly those that have experienced
   an abnormal environment, must be considered equally dangerous and managed as UXO until
   assessed and determined otherwise by EOD personnel, EOD-qualified U.S. Army Forces
   Command/20th Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion personnel and, when
   specifically authorized by the AF installation commander, UXO-qualified personnel.
   Military munitions that have experienced abnormal environments include, but are not limited
   to, munitions remaining after attempted demilitarization by open burning (OB) or open
   detonation (OD); munitions involved in accidents or fires; munitions or components
   subjected to certain tests (e.g., fuze arming tests, jolt and jumble tests) that might cause
   arming. (U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support Command/ 22nd Chemical Battalion is
   manned with specially trained personnel that provide verification, sampling, detection,
   mitigation, render safe, decontamination, packaging, escort, and remediation of chemical,
   biological and industrial devices or hazardous materials.)
       17.2.1.1. UXO will most likely be found in areas that the DoD currently uses (e.g.,
       operational ranges) or once used (e.g., former ranges) for military munitions training or
       testing. For a variety of reasons, UXO can also be encountered in other areas, to include
       where contingency, combat, or military operations other than war have occurred.
       17.2.1.2. Munitions that may have experienced an abnormal environment might be
       encountered in areas at which an accident or incident involving military munitions
       occurred, in areas that the DoD uses or once used for open detonation of excess, obsolete,
       or unserviceable military munitions, or in other areas.
   17.2.2. Positive identification of any potential explosive or CA hazards and consideration of
   the potential consequences of an intentional or accidental detonation is required before
   disposition of any recovered munition. This is essential for munitions that might contain CA
   that would pose a potential downwind CA hazard. Therefore, for both explosives and CA
   safety reasons, munitions found outside the DoD’s established logistical munitions
   management systems (e.g., UXO, DMM) shall be managed as UXO, until assessed,
   identified, and evaluated as to their explosive or CA hazards and determined otherwise by
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                   405


   EOD qualified personnel. Munitions that contain an unknown liquid fill shall also be
   managed as chemical warfare material (CWM) until assessed, and the fill determined.
      17.2.2.1. Only EOD personnel and, in some cases, U.S. Army Forces Command/20th
      Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion personnel will respond to military or civilian
      authority requests for support to an explosives or munitions emergency.
      17.2.2.2. For responses that either involve recovered CWM (RCWM) or munitions that
      contain an unknown liquid fill, U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support
      Command/22nd Chemical Battalion personnel and, in cases where the munition’s
      physical characteristics allow positive identification, EOD personnel, are the only DoD
      personnel authorized to determine the most probable fill of such munitions. The
      determination as to whether certain munitions contain a CA fill is difficult, if not
      impossible, solely by visual inspection.
          17.2.2.2.1. Many munitions have physical characteristics (e.g., shape, markings) that
          permit technically qualified personnel to rule out the potential for a CA fill. For
          example, a U.S.-manufactured 4-inch Stokes mortar’s physical dimensions clearly
          indicate whether it contains a CA or explosive fill. However, the design or physical
          condition of some munitions may not allow their complete identification by visual
          inspection. This is especially true for used munitions and for munitions that have
          either experienced abnormal environments or been exposed to the elements (e.g.,
          buried or submerged) for an extended period.
          17.2.2.2.2. Munitions whose external design does not always allow positive visual
          identification of their filler include, but may not be limited to: 4.2-inch mortars (M1,
          M2, and the M2A1 models) and Livens projectiles (MKII (M1) and MKIIAI) models.
          U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion
          personnel and, in some cases, EOD personnel, are the only DoD personnel authorized
          to determine the most probable fill of these munitions.
   17.2.3. Discovery of military munitions (e.g., UXO) outside the DoD’s munitions logistics
   management system might, in some circumstances, indicate that a munitions response (see
   Chapter 15) or other protective measures are warranted. Installations shall notify
   AFSC/SEW, who will in-turn notify the Chairman, DDESB of:
      17.2.3.1. Repetitive explosives or munitions emergency responses to a discrete
      geographic area, where the circumstances surrounding the explosives or munitions
      emergency response are similar.
      17.2.3.2. A single explosives or munitions emergency response that involves multiple
      military munitions (e.g., UXO, DMM, or RCWM) discovered at a discrete geographic
      area. Such discoveries might indicate that the area is a Formally Used Defense Site
      (FUDS).

Section 17B—Disposition

17.3. Disposition of UXO and of Other Military Munitions Being Managed as UXO
   17.3.1. The DoD is responsible for protecting people, property, and the environment from
   potential explosive hazards (e.g., blast and fragmentation) or CA hazards (e.g., downwind
406                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


  hazards) associated with DoD-owned UXO. The DoD is equally responsible for protecting
  personnel who respond to address such hazards.
  17.3.2. USAF will work collaboratively with environmental regulators and safety officials
  toward resolving, in a mutually agreeable manner, any concerns with the planned disposition
  of UXO during a response action; however, the protection of people, to include DoD
  response personnel, from the hazards associated with the discovered munition and with its
  disposition is paramount.
  17.3.3. There are no safe procedures for moving, rendering safe, or destroying UXO, but
  merely procedures considered less dangerous. Destruction-in-place (also referred to as blow-
  inplace (BIP)) is the least dangerous; therefore, it is the preferred method of UXO
  destruction.
  17.3.4. DoD response actions to address UXO must comply with these Standards and other
  applicable DoD policies and with applicable federal, state, interstate, and local laws and
  regulations, and any enforceable agreements. Installations must ensure that, if not already in
  place, protective measures (e.g., site security) are implemented as quickly as practicable
  following discovery of UXO or other munitions outside the DoD’s munitions logistics
  management system. Should environmental regulators and safety officials have concerns
  regarding the sufficiency of the protective measures to be taken, these concerns should be
  raised to the AFSC/SEW, who will in-turn notify the Chairman, DDESB for resolution.
  Protective measures must be maintained throughout any delay caused by:
      17.3.4.1. Compliance with laws, regulations, and agreements.
      17.3.4.2. The need to address concerns raised by environmental regulators and safety
      officials about:
         17.3.4.2.1. Methods for managing any potential adverse impacts (e.g., harming
         endangered species, damaging cultural resources) of implementing a pending BIP
         operation.
         17.3.4.2.2. The use of alternative (to BIP) disposition methods.
      17.3.4.3. Other factors (e.g., weather).
  17.3.5. Military munitions known to contain CA or contain or are suspected to contain an
  unknown liquid fill will not normally be destroyed by open detonation because they pose
  potential downwind CA hazards. The responsible DoD Component (normally the
  Department of the Army), no lower than the Deputy Assistant Secretary level, may approve
  individual exceptions. Such exceptions should only be approved after discussions (see
  paragraph 17.3.2.) with appropriate elected representatives, environmental regulators, and
  safety officials from those communities that could potentially be impacted by the munition’s
  disposition. DoD Components must make sure that protective measures to ensure explosives
  safety are maintained during any delay in disposition.
  17.3.6. UXO shall not be moved unless EOD qualified personnel determine that the risks
  associated with movement are acceptable. (During munitions responses, specifically
  authorized UXO-qualified personnel may make this determination.) Although environmental
  regulators and safety officials recognize the expertise of AF personnel involved in UXO
  disposition decisions, they may challenge an AF field expert’s decision and seek to elevate
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    407


  their concerns to higher levels of authority for resolution. (See paragraphs 17.3.2 and
  17.3.4.)
     17.3.6.1. If EOD qualified personnel determine that the risk associated with movement is
     unacceptable, or if the munition’s condition precludes a complete assessment beyond
     positive identification of any potential explosive hazard or determination that it does not
     present a CA hazard, then it should be BIP.
     17.3.6.2. In some circumstances, EOD personnel may determine that careful movement
     of a UXO, for a limited distance and using prescribed EOD procedures, is both necessary
     and allowed by EOD procedures. In such circumstances, destruction by detonation will
     occur in the general vicinity of discovery.
  17.3.7. Under some circumstances, when BIP does not pose an immediate, certain, and
  unacceptable risk to people, critical operations, facilities, or equipment, environmental
  regulators and safety officials may seek collaboration (see paragraph 17.3.2.) with the AF
  installation Commander to mutually agree to mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts
  of the pending BIP to public safety, the environment, and cultural resources. (See paragraph
  17.3.4.)
  17.3.8. When BIP poses an immediate, certain, and unacceptable risk to people, critical
  operations, facilities, or equipment, EOD personnel may determine that render safe
  procedures (RSP) should be attempted.
     17.3.8.1. Because the application of RSP exposes EOD personnel to added risks (greater
     than BIP), the application of RSP shall only be attempted in limited circumstances.
     17.3.8.2. Should EOD personnel employ RSP, protective measures shall be applied to
     mitigate potential explosive effects and, when necessary, a possible CA release.
     17.3.8.3. Only EOD personnel are authorized to conduct RSP.
     17.3.8.4. EOD personnel shall perform RSP per Joint Service EOD Technical Data.
         17.3.8.4.1. Conflicts between this Standard and the Joint Service EOD Technical
         Data should be raised through AFSC/SEW to the Chairman, DDESB, and to the Joint
         EOD Program Board for resolution.
         17.3.8.4.2. When the condition of UXO (e.g., crushed, bent, broken, mangled)
         precludes strict adherence to published procedures, onsite EOD personnel will
         determine and perform the procedure -- established or innovative -- that will have the
         most probable degree of success to render the munitions safe while mitigating
         potential explosive or, when necessary, CA effects.
  17.3.9. The onsite EOD supervisor, in the case of munitions responses, the UXO safety
  officer, shall ensure that the detonation site is inspected after each detonation or any misfire.
  No one shall be allowed within the Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) from the
  detonation site until the onsite EOD supervisor or UXO safety officer declares the area is
  safe.
  17.3.10. When EOD personnel or, in the case of munitions responses, authorized UXO
  personnel, positively identify UXO as to its explosive hazard and determine it safe to dispose
  of by other than BIP or immediate destruction by detonation, either in the general vicinity of
 408                                                          AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   discovery or at a designated location then the AF installation Commander, with the advice of
   EOD personnel, may evaluate a variety of safe disposition alternatives and options for
   managing any potentially adverse impact of the selected disposition alternative. (See
   paragraph 17.3.2.)

Section 17C— Special Considerations

17.4. General
   17.4.1. Disassembly and Inerting Operations
       17.4.1.1. Disassembly and inerting operations shall not be conducted without proper
       authorization.
       17.4.1.2. Contact AFSC/SEW for additional guidance on disassembly and inerting
       operations.
   17.4.2. Construction Support
       17.4.2.1. Construction support may be required during intrusive activities (e.g., laying or
       repairing utilities, improving roads) on property known or suspected to contain UXO or
       DMM.
       17.4.2.2. The responsible authority (e.g., installation commander or designated
       representative) shall determine the level of construction support required on a case-by-
       case basis. Construction support is determined by the probability of encountering UXO
       or DMM.
          17.4.2.2.1. Low Probability. EOD personnel must be contacted to ensure they are
          available, advised about the project, and placed ―on call‖ to assist if suspected UXO
          are encountered during construction. (Discoveries of UXO or DMM on such sites
          requires reassessment of the level of support required.)
                17.4.2.2.1.1. A ―low‖ determination may only be assigned to those areas for
                which a search of available historical records and onsite investigation data
                indicates that, given the military or munitions-related activities that occurred at
                the site, the likelihood that UXO or other MEC are present is low.
                17.4.2.2.1.2. Munitions-related activities that may merit a ―low‖ determination
                include, but are not limited to, the use of the area: for live-fire training exclusively
                with small arms ammunition; for maneuver training, to include maneuver training
                involving the use of smokes, pyrotechnics, and simulators; as firing points; for
                munitions inspection, handling, storage, or transfers, to include residue points and
                inert storage yards; for air defense; or as munitions operating facilities, the
                exceptions being facilities in which the processes used might have resulted in the
                generation of concentrations of munitions constituents high enough to present an
                explosive hazard. Areas on which a previous response has been completed,
                pursuant to a DDESB-approved ESS, for the stipulated reuse also qualify for
                ―low‖ determinations.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                  409


        17.4.2.2.2. Moderate to High Probability. EOD personnel must attempt to identify
        and remove any explosive or CA hazards in the construction footprint prior to any
        intrusive construction activities.
            17.4.2.2.2.1. A ―moderate to high‖ determination may be assigned to those areas
            for which a search of available historical records or onsite investigation data
            indicates that, given the military or munitions-related activities that occurred at
            the site, there is more than a low probability that UXO or other MEC are present.
            17.4.2.2.2.2. Munitions-related activities that may merit a ―moderate to high‖
            determination include, but are not limited to, the use of the area: for live-fire
            training other than exclusively with small arms ammunition (e.g., munitions
            containing high explosive projectiles); as operational range impact areas; for OB
            or OD of excess, obsolete, or unserviceable munitions; as munitions operating
            facilities where processes used might have resulted in the generation of
            concentrations of munitions constituents high enough to present an explosive
            hazard; for munitions burial; or for any activities involving possible disposition of
            CWM.
  17.4.3. Anomaly Avoidance. Anomaly avoidance techniques must be employed on
  properties known or suspected to contain UXO or DMM to avoid surface UXO and, when
  necessary, subsurface anomalies.
     17.4.3.1. When anomaly avoidance is used during training (e.g., maneuver training, live-
     fire training), testing, or operational range management activities conducted on such
     properties, the commander responsible for such activities will ensure:
        17.4.3.1.1. A risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards associated with the
        proposed activities is completed and methods to mitigate any potential exposures are
        implemented.
        17.4.3.1.2. Training in anomaly avoidance, explosives safety and, when appropriate,
        CA safety training is provided to all personnel involved in the training, testing, or
        operational range management activities that access property known or suspected to
        contain UXO or DMM.
     17.4.3.2. When anomaly avoidance is used during other than training or testing activities,
     or during activities involving other than operational range management activities:
        17.4.3.2.1. Surface UXO must be avoided during any activities that require entry to
        the area (e.g., conducting cultural resource studies).
        17.4.3.2.2. Surface UXO and subsurface anomalies must be avoided during any
        intrusive work (e.g., drilling environmental monitoring wells).
        17.4.3.2.3. Escort support must be provided by EOD personnel, or:
            17.4.3.2.3.1. Within areas known or suspected to contain UXO, excluding CA,
            regardless of configuration, by:
                17.4.3.2.3.1.1. UXO-qualified personnel.
                17.4.3.2.3.1.2. UXO Technician I personnel under the supervision of UXO
                qualified personnel. The responsible commander or authority may, based on a
 410                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


                  risk assessment and implementation of methods to mitigate any potential
                  exposures, approve UXO Technician I personnel to perform escort duties
                  without supervision.
              17.4.3.2.3.2. Within areas known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of
              configuration, to include areas where such CA is commingled with other UXO, by
              UXO qualified personnel trained in CWM responses.
          17.4.3.2.4. During anomaly avoidance:
              17.4.3.2.4.1. Discovered surface UXO must be avoided and their locations noted
              and reported to appropriate authorities.
              17.4.3.2.4.2. Detected subsurface anomalies which must not be investigated shall
              be marked, when appropriate, and avoided.

Section 17D— Access to UXO Areas

17.5. Access to Areas Known or Suspected to Contain UXO. To ensure explosives and CA
safety risk is identified and controlled on real property currently or formerly under the
jurisdiction, custody, or control of USAF, the AF installation Commander must:
   17.5.1. Prohibit unnecessary access (e.g., livestock grazing; recreational uses, such as
   hunting and hiking) and take appropriate action to deter unauthorized access to areas under
   AF control that are known or suspected to contain UXO or other munitions that have
   experienced abnormal environments.
       17.5.1.1. Access to such areas, particularly operational range impact areas, shall be
       limited to personnel who have an operational requirement to enter such areas (e.g., range
       maintenance, environmental monitoring, security). A risk assessment to evaluate the
       potential hazards associated with the proposed activity shall be completed and methods to
       mitigate any potential exposures shall be implemented before allowing access.
       17.5.1.2. Actions to prohibit or deter access may include establishing access controls
       (e.g., fencing the area, establishing roving security patrols) and providing public
       notifications (e.g., posting UXO hazard warning signs, conducting UXO safety education
       programs) of any potential hazards. (When used, signs must be legible and, when
       appropriate, multi-lingual or pictograms.)
   17.5.2. When the USAF does not control the area (e.g., FUDS), at a minimum, provide
   written notification to the property owner and, if known, any tenants of the potential
   explosive and CA hazards present. A record of this notification must be maintained in
   permanent records.
   17.5.3. Assume the following areas contain UXO or other munitions that have experienced
   abnormal environments:
       17.5.3.1. Operational range impact areas, to include their associated safety zones (e.g.,
       caution area, safety buffer zone). Exceptions include, but are not limited to, ranges used
       exclusively for training with small arms ammunition.
       17.5.3.2. Ranges (sites) used for OB or OD of excess, obsolete, or unserviceable
       munitions.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                               411


     17.5.3.3. Former impact areas and former OB or OD sites, unless documentation exists
     to show that they were adequately cleared during range closure or that an appropriate
     munitions response has been completed. In some cases, because these former impact
     areas or former OB or OD sites may have transferred from USAF control, the AF’s
     ability to restrict access may be limited or nonexistent. In such cases, USAF shall, at a
     minimum, ensure that:
         17.5.3.3.1. The property owner is provided written notification of the potential
         explosives and CA hazards and the risks inherent in any use of property that is
         inconsistent with those hazards.
         17.5.3.3.2. A public UXO safety education program is implemented, when
         appropriate.
  17.5.4. On USAF property, prohibit construction in areas known or suspected to contain
  UXO or DMM without required:
     17.5.4.1. Construction or UXO avoidance support. (See paragraphs 17.4.2. or 17.4.3.)
     17.5.4.2. Approved ESS, CSS, or site plan for munitions responses. (See Chapter 15.)
  17.5.5. Provide, or in the case of owners or tenants of non-USAF controlled property, offer
  explosives safety and, when appropriate, CA safety training to all individuals authorized
  access to USAF property known or suspected to contain UXO.
  17.5.6. Develop guidelines to determine when individuals, who for operational reasons (e.g.,
  environmental monitoring), are authorized access to areas under USAF control that are
  known or suspected to contain UXO, must be escorted into the area in accordance with
  subparagraph 17.4.3.2.3.
  17.5.7. Establish UXO safety education programs to educate USAF personnel, their
  dependents, and private citizens that live near areas known or suspected to contain UXO
  about explosive hazards and, when appropriate, CA hazards associated with UXO, and with
  the risks associated with trespassing on operational ranges or with entering areas known or
  suspected to contain UXO.
  17.5.8. Prior to changing the use of a property known or suspected to contain UXO or
  munitions that have experienced abnormal environments to a use that is incompatible with
  their presence:
     17.5.8.1. For operational ranges, perform an appropriate range clearance, whether
     changing to a similar (e.g., converting an impact area to a hand grenade range) or
     dissimilar use (e.g., changing a range to a maneuver area).
     17.5.8.2. For areas on USAF property, other than operational ranges, perform an
     appropriate munitions response.
     17.5.8.3. For property not under USAF control, upon learning of a proposed change in
     use or pertinent munitions response action, offer to engage in munitions response
     activities only to the extent necessary to ensure planned response actions afford
     protectiveness from an explosives and CA safety perspective. The USAF engagement in
     such munitions response activities may be limited to explosives safety experts providing
     basic guidance and advice during applicable deliberations, decision making, and approval
 412                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       activities unless additional DoD services are arranged through contractual or
       reimbursement mechanisms between USAF and other responsible parties.

Section 17E—Identification and Control

17.6. To ensure explosives and CA safety risk is identified and controlled on real property
currently or formerly under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the USAF, Installation
Commanders must create and maintain permanent records required by paragraph
15.2.2. When an operational range is closed or an installation is deactivated, the Installation
Commander must designate the office to transfer these records to ensure their permanent
retention.
17.7. Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) for UXO
   17.7.1. The MSD for intentional detonations (see Chapter 15), which may be reduced if
   supported by a hazard assessment or when using approved engineering controls listed in
   EOD publications (for explosives or munitions emergency responses), or other DDESB
   approved engineering controls (for munitions responses), is the greatest distance of:
       17.7.1.1. Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D = 328W1/3.
       17.7.1.2. The calculated MFD.
       17.7.1.3. The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA.
   17.7.2. The MSD for unintentional detonations (see Chapter 15), which may be reduced if
   supported by a hazard assessment or when approved engineering controls are employed, for:
       17.7.2.1. Nonessential Personnel. The greatest distance of:
          17.7.2.1.1. Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D = 40W1/3.
          17.7.2.1.2. The calculated MFD. (NOTE: Lesser distances may be used if supported
          by a hazard assessment; however, in no case will the distance be less than the HFD;
          the exception is when approved engineering controls are used.)
          17.7.2.1.3. The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA.
       17.7.2.2. Team Separation Distance (TSD). The greatest distance of:
          17.7.2.2.1. Blast overpressure, as computed by the formula: D = 40W1/3.
          17.7.2.2.2. The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA.

Section 17F—Other Considerations

17.8. General
   17.8.1. Transportation. All transportation must comply with the requirements of applicable
   federal, state, interstate, and local laws, and all implementing regulations relating to
   transportation of solid waste, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, and toxic
   substances.
       17.8.1.1. UXO. Before UXO that may pose an explosive or CA hazard may be
       transported or shipped over public transportation routes, EOD personnel must determine
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    413


     whether the UXO is safe for transport. A determination that the UXO is safe for transport
     must be documented in the EOD incident report. A copy of the incident report must
     accompany the shipment.
     17.8.1.2. RCWM. Before RCWM may be transported or shipped, it must be assessed by
     the Army Material Assessment Review Board as safe for transport and packaged in an
     over-pack container specifically designed and approved by the Army and by the DOT for
     the transport of RCWM (see subparagraph 15.5.9.9.1.2.). In addition, the specific
     notifications and concurrences required in 50 U.S.C. § 1512 must be met.
  17.8.2. Firefighting Involving Areas Known or Suspected to Contain UXO or DMM. (See
  Chapter 10.)
     17.8.2.1. Advanced planning is essential for firefighting operations involving areas that
     are known or suspected to contain UXO or DMM or CA hazards. Coordination of such
     plans between firefighters and explosives safety personnel or EOD personnel and, when
     appropriate, CA safety professionals, is essential.
     17.8.2.2. Senior firefighting personnel should carefully assess whether to fight a fire
     involving areas that are known or suspected to contain explosive or CA hazards. Factors
     to consider include, but are not limited, to: the types of munitions that might be present;
     the safety of firefighting personnel and of the public; the potential loss of critical assets;
     and the duration and intensity of the fire.
        17.8.2.2.1. When the decision is made not to fight such fires, the area should be
        evacuated and remain so until it has cooled for at least 24 hours. (See paragraph
        10.10.)
        17.8.2.2.2. When the decision is made to fight such fires, all firefighters involved in
        fighting the fire should be provided basic safety training for fighting fires involving
        military munitions.
  17.8.3. Controlled Burns
     17.8.3.1. Burning vegetation to facilitate safe UXO clearance or removal operations is
     permitted, provided proper safeguards are in place to protect all personnel from
     unintentional detonations. These burns must be carefully planned and executed to manage
     explosives safety risks and environmental effects. During such burning operations, all
     personnel shall be at MFD from the burning or burned area, based on the munition with
     the greatest fragment distance, and shall remain out of the area until it has cooled for at
     least 24 hours.
     17.8.3.2. Controlled burns will not be performed on areas known or suspected to contain
     CWM.
  17.8.4. Technology
     17.8.4.1. Explosives safety is a paramount consideration when determining the most
     appropriate technologies to be used to detect, excavate, remove, and dispose of UXO and
     other munitions that present an explosive hazard.
 414                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


       17.8.4.2. The use of remotely operated equipment (e.g., excavators, sifters, and
       shredders) or other standoff technologies (e.g., lasers) may offer the safest approach for
       excavating and destroying UXO and should be considered.
       17.8.4.3. Subparagraph 15.5.8.3.5. addresses mechanized UXO processing operations.

Terms

The following terms and phrases commonly used in explosives safety operations are described
here to provide uniformity. Use standard and service dictionaries for other terms.

Aboveground Magazine—Any building or structure, except an operating building, used for the
storage of explosives. Magazines are of two general types: igloo (earth-covered) and
aboveground (no earth covering). An aboveground magazine is any structure or facility, without
sufficient earth covering, used for the storage of explosives. For igloo see ―Earth-covered
Magazine‖. Also includes open air munitions stocks, trucks, trailers, railcars or cargo aircraft
loaded with explosives.

Aboveground Structure/Site (AGS)—Any aboveground, non-earth-covered structure/site.

Acceptor/Donor—A total quantity of stored AE may be subdivided into separate storage units
in order to reduce the MCE. The separation distances between separate storage units, with or
without an intervening barrier, need to be sufficient (i.e. IMD) to ensure that propagation
between units does not occur. The storage unit that reacts initially is termed the donor and
nearby units, which may be endangered, are termed acceptors.

Active Installation—A military installation that is currently in service and being regularly used
for military activities.

Administration Area—The area in which administrative offices for the entire organization are
located, excluding those offices located near and directly serving explosives storage and
operating areas.

AE Aircraft Cargo Area—Any area specifically designated for:

        1. Aircraft loading or unloading of transportation configured AE.

the definitive drawing to be reviewed again, provided the design has not been changed.

Deflagration—A rapid chemical reaction in which the output of heat is enough to enable the
reaction to proceed and accelerate without input of heat from another source. The effect of a true
deflagration under confinement is an explosion. Confinement of the reaction increases pressure,

Electromagnetic Environment (EME)—The EME is the resulting product of the power and
time distribution, within various frequency ranges, and includes the radiated and conducted
electromagnetic emission levels that may be encountered. It is the totality of electromagnetic
energy, from man made and natural sources, to which a platform/system, or
subsystem/equipment will be exposed within any domain, that is, land, air, space, and sea, while
performing its intended mission throughout its operational life cycle (in the case of munitions,
during its stockpile-to-safe separation sequence). When defined, the EME will be for a particular
time and place. Specific equipment characteristics, such as operating frequencies, emitter power
levels, and receiver sensitivity, operational factors such as distances between items and force
structure, and frequency coordination all contribute to the EME. In addition, transient emissions
and their associated rise and fall times such as from EMP, lightning, and p-static also contribute.
(MIL-HDBK-237)

Emergency Withdrawal Distance—. Distance to which personnel are removed from an ES
during an explosive accident or incident.

Energetic Liquid—A liquid, slurry, or gel, consisting of, or containing an explosive, oxidizer,
fuel, or combination of the above, that may undergo, contribute to, or cause rapid exothermic
decomposition, deflagration or detonation.

Energetic Materials—Energetic materials are chemical compounds, or mixtures of chemical
compounds, that are divided into three groups according to use: explosives , propellants, and
pyrotechnics. Explosives and propellants that have been properly initiated evolve large volumes
of hot gas in a short time. The difference between explosives and propellants is the rate at which
the reaction proceeds. In explosives, a fast reaction produces a very high pressure shock in the
surrounding medium. This shock is capable of shattering objects. In propellants, a slower
reaction produces a lower pressure over a longer period of time. This lower sustained pressure is
used to propel objects. Pyrotechnics evolve large amounts of heat but much less gas than
propellants or explosives. Various external stimuli can cause release of the energy contained in
energetic materials. Knowing the response of individual energetic materials to specific stimuli is
important from the point of view of safety. Energetic materials are sensitive to four external
stimuli. These are: impact, shock, electrostatic, and thermal. Eliminating or controlling these
stimuli are key to eliminating the unintentional initiation of energetic material. The focus of this
Manual is on these four areas. The hazards associated with energetic material are blast,
fragments, mass fire, fire and toxicity.

Engineering Controls—Management of facility operations through the use of engineering
principles (e.g., facility design, operation sequencing, equipment selection, or process
limitations).

Entry Control Point (ECP)—A location or facility used to control pedestrian or vehicular
access to controlled or restricted areas. It is commonly found at the entrance to munitions
storage areas and combat aircraft parking areas. If it is a permanent facility, it is sometimes also
called a Gate House.

Essential Personnel—As used in this Manual, essential personnel are those who are required to
participate in an AE operation.

Evaluation Zone—The area around an ES where the PESs, if filled to maximum capacity, could
violate Q-D to that ES. (Remember a PES is also an ES). This zone determines the PESs that

tunnel chamber complex. It may also function as an operating area within the underground
facility or as a debris trap.

Explosion Proof—Used in referring to electrical equipment; specifically, to equipment enclosed
in a case that can withstand an internal burning or explosion of elements inside the case, and can
prevent ignition by spark, flash, or explosion of any outside gas or vapor surrounding the
enclosure.

Explosion Reaction—Ignition and rapid burning of the confined energetic materials builds up
high local pressures leading to breakup of the confining structure. Metal cases are fragmented
(e.g., brittle fracture) into large pieces that are often thrown long distances. Unreacted or
burning energetic materials are also thrown about. Fire and smoke hazards will exist. Air
shocks are produced that can cause damage to nearby structures. The blast and high velocity
fragments can cause minor ground craters and damage (e.g., breakup, tearing, gouging) to
adjacent metal plates. Blast pressures are lower than for a detonation reaction.

Explosive—A substance or a mixture of substances that is capable by chemical reaction of
producing gas at such temperature, pressure and speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.
The term explosive includes all substances variously known as high explosives and propellants,
together with igniter, primer, initiation and pyrotechnic (e.g., illuminant, smoke, delay, decoy,
flare and incendiary compositions.

Explosive Accident—Accidents resulting in damage or injury from:

military munitions response activity that involves the placement of explosives on a site; the
intentional physical contact with munitions and explosives of concern (MEC); or the conduct of
ground-disturbing activities or other intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to contain
MEC. The ESS details the scope of the project, the planned work activities, and potential

explosives, or disassembled or open components) and that are susceptible to initiation directly by
static or mechanical spark, or create (or accidentally create) explosive dust, or give off vapors,
fumes, or gases in explosives concentrations. This also includes exudation and explosives

Hazardous Operation (Space Launch)—A specific operation requiring the establishment of a
Safety Control Area; nonessential personnel will be evacuated for the Safety Control Area.
Range Safety designates certain functions and procedures as hazardous operations when LSRM
segments are being processed. Because these operations have a greater than normal potential for
causing mishaps, certain controls are implemented. A solid rocket motor segment being lifted by
a crane is an example of a hazardous operation. In addition to the activation of a Safety Control

distance separation required because of minimum fragment protection.)

Inert—Contains no explosives, active chemicals, or pyrotechnics, but is not necessarily
noncombustible.

Inhabited Buildings—Structures, other than AE-related buildings, occupied by personnel or the
General Public, both within and outside DoD establishments (e.g., schools, churches, residences,

Joint Use Airfield—An airfield serving both DoD and commercial aircraft. An airfield serving
solely DoD, DoD chartered, or non-DoD aircraft on DoD authorized business is not joint use.
ATF, DOE, DEA, and other federal use aircraft are not considered commercial; therefore, joint-
use standards do not apply.

Joint Use Space Launch Facility—A space launch facility serving both governmental and an
authorized commercial users.

K Factor—The factor in the formula D=KW1/3 used in QD determinations where D represents
distance in ft and W is the NEW in lb. The K factor is a constant and represents the degree of
protection that is provided.

Largest Single Round Net Explosive Weight for Quantity Distance (LSRN)—Equal to the
largest single round NEWQD HD 1.2.3 item present. Because it is not expected that there will
be an HD 1.2.3 item with an LSRN greater than 450 pounds, and to simplify calculations, the
LSRN should be capped at < 450 pounds.

AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                    449



Magazine—Any building or structure, except an operating building, used for the storage of
explosives. Magazines are of two general types: igloo (earth-covered) and aboveground (no
earth covering). An aboveground magazine is any structure or facility, without sufficient earth

various types of ammunition or containers. Most of the entire quantity can explode
instantaneously when a small portion is subjected to fire, to severe concussion or impact, to the
impulse of an initiating agent, or to the effect of a considerable discharge of external energy.
Such an explosion will generally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. The
explosion may cause detonation of other items of ammunition and explosives stored near enough
to (and not adequately protected from) the initially exploding pile, so that the two or more
quantities must be considered as one for quantity-distance (Q-D) purposes.

Mast LPS—A LPS that consists of one or more poles with a strike termination device connected
to an earth electrode system by down conductors. Its purpose is to intercept lightning flashes and
provide a zone of protection.

Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH)— Material that, prior to
determination of its explosives safety status, potentially contains explosives or munitions (e.g.,
munitions containers and packaging material; munitions debris remaining after munitions use,
demilitarization, or disposal; and range-related debris); or potentially contains a high enough
concentration of explosives such that the material presents an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment,
drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that were associated with munitions
production, demilitarization or disposal operations). Excluded from MPPEH are munitions
within the DoD established munitions management system and other hazardous items that may
present explosion hazards (e.g., gasoline cans, compressed gas cylinders) that are not munitions
and are not intended for use as munitions.

Maximum Credible Event (MCE)—In hazards evaluation, the MCE from a hypothesized
accidental explosion, fire, or toxic chemical agent release (with explosives contribution) is the
worst single event that is likely to occur from a given quantity and disposition of AE. The event
must be realistic with a reasonable probability of occurrence considering the explosion
propagation, burning rate characteristics, and physical protection given to the items involved.
The MCE evaluated on this basis may then be used as a basis for effects calculations and
casualty predictions.

Maximum Fragment Distance— The calculated maximum distance to which any fragment
from the cylindrical portion of an AE case is expected to be thrown by the design mode
detonation of a single item. This distance does not address fragments produced be sections of
nose plugs, base plates, boattails, and/or lugs. These special fragments, from the non-cylindrical
portions of the AE case, can travel to significantly greater distances (i.e., >10,000 ft) than the
calculated maximum distances. The maximum fragment distance may also be the measured
distance, based on testing, to which any fragment from an AE item is thrown.

Military Munitions—All ammunition products and components produced or used by or for the
U.S. DoD or the U.S. Armed Services for national defense and security, including military

rounds, artillery ammunition, small arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges,
cluster munitions and dispensers, demolition charges, and devices and components thereof.
―Military munitions‖ do not include wholly inert items, improvised explosive devices, and
nuclear weapons, nuclear devices, and nuclear components thereof. However, that term does
include non-nuclear components of nuclear devices, managed under the DoE's nuclear weapons
program, after all required sanitizing operations under the ―Atomic Energy Act of 1954,‖ as
amended, have been completed (40 CFR Section 260.10, reference (am)).

Mishap—An accident or an unexpected event involving DoD ammunition and explosives.

Mitigation—A feature that reduces, limits or controls the consequences of an AE reaction.

Modules—A barricaded area composed of one or more connected cells (revetments) with hard
surface storage pads separated from one another by the prescribed barricade. A light metal
building may be used in individual cells.

munitions-related operations such as flight line service roads supporting combat and hot cargo
aircraft operations; roads outside the MSA used by security forces supporting MSA operations;
roads inside the MSA; roads around the combat aircraft parking area used strictly to support
combat aircraft operations. These roads are exempt of QD criteria.

Net Explosive Weight (NEW)—The total quantity, expressed in pounds, of explosives material
or pyrotechnics in each item or round.

Net Explosive Weight for QD (NEWQD)—The total quantity, expressed in pounds [kilograms],
of high explosives equivalency in each item or round to be used when applying QD criteria or
other standards. The NEWQD is equal to the NEW unless hazard classification testing has
shown that a lower weight is appropriate for QD purposes. (Note: If the NEWQD is less than
the NEW, the reason is usually that propellant or other substances do not contribute as much to
the blast effect as the same amount of high explosive would.)

New Construction—For the intended purpose of this Manual ―new construction‖ is the
introduction of any facility ―portable, temporary or permanent‖ inside the IB and must have an
explosives site plan accomplished and approved before authorizing construction or positioned in

DoD.

Non-DoD Operations/Storage—Explosives operations/storage conducted on DoD property in
accordance with Table 12.29, BATF, FAA or other federal, state, and local explosives safety
requirements. Under these type operations, DoD will be responsible only for insuring IM
standards are met as outlined in explosives site plan submissions. This does not constitute ―DoD
oversight‖ as intended in the definition of ―DoD Operations/Storage.‖

Non-Essential Personnel—As used in this Manual, non-essential personnel are those who
are not required to participate in an AE operation.

operations are conducted that provide direct support to an Air Force explosives area or
explosives operation.

Non-Robust Munitions—Those HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE that are not categorized as SG 1, SG 3,
SG 4, or SG 5. Examples of Non-Robust Munitions include torpedoes and underwater mines
(see also Sensitivity Group). For purposes of determining case fragment distances for intentional
detonations, non-robust munitions are those munitions not meeting the definition of robust
munitions.

Operating Location—A building, facility, or site in which operations pertaining to the
manufacturing, processing, handling, or assembling of ammunition and explosives are done.
This includes preload facilities for aircraft multiple and triple ejector racks. However, flightline
explosives loading activities are defined as "explosives areas or locations" are not operating
locations.

hire.

Pier—A landing place or platform built into the water, perpendicular or oblique to the shore, for
the berthing of vessels.

Portal Barricade—A barricade that is placed in front of an entrance into an underground
storage facility. Its function is to reflect that portion of the shock wave moving directly outward
from the entrance, thereby, reducing the pressures along the extended tunnel axis and increasing
the pressures in the opposite direction. The result is a more circular IBD area centered at the
portal.

one potential explosion site to another by fire, fragment, or blast (shock wave), where the
interval between explosions is long enough to limit the total overpressure at any given time to
that which each explosion produces independently. This condition, where detonation occurs,
would be evidenced by a distinct shock wave from each detonation, with a discernible pressure
drop between each explosion (see "simultaneous detonation").

Public Exclusion Distance—The calculated distance from the toxic chemical agent source at
which no more than 10.0, 4.3, and 150 milligrams per minute per cubic meter is present for GB,

Quantity-Distance (QD)—The quantity of explosive material and distance separation
relationships that provide defined levels of protection. The relationships are based on levels of
risk considered acceptable for specific exposures and are tabulated in applicable QD tables.
These separation distances do not provide absolute safety or protection. Greater distances than

 456                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


Sensitivity Group (SG)—A category used to describe the susceptibility of HD 1.1 and HD 1.2
AE to sympathetic detonation (SD) for the purpose of storage within a HPM, or where Armco,
Inc. revetments or SDW are used to reduce MCE. Each HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 munition is
designated, based on its physical attributes, into one of five SG (the SG can be found in the
JHCS); directed energy weapons are further identified by assigning the suffix ―D‖ following the
SG designation. The SG are:

SG1 – Robust munitions (see Robust Munitions).
      SG2 – Non-robust munitions (see Non-Robust Munitions).
      SG3 – Fragmenting munitions (see Fragmenting Munitions).
      SG4 – CBU weapons (see Cluster Bomb/Dispenser Unit munitions).
      SG5 – SD Sensitive Munitions. Munitions for which HPM non-propagation walls are not
      effective. Munitions are assigned to SG5 when either very sensitive to propagation or the
      sensitivity has not been determined.

(NOTE: For purposes of determining case fragment distances for intentional detonations, SG1
items will be either Robust or Extremely Heavy Case Munitions, SG3 items are considered
Robust Munitions, and SG2, SG4, and SG5 munitions are considered Non-Robust Munitions).

Service Magazine—An auxiliary building servicing an operation used for the intermediate
storage of explosives.

Shared Launch Facility—Any space or orbital launch facility that supports both DoD and non-
DoD launch services and operations, as determined by the DoD Component involved or by

Sideflash—The phenomenon where lightning current will arc through a non-conductive medium
in order to attach to other objects. An electrical spark caused by differences of potential that
occurs between conductive metal bodies or between such metal bodies and a component of the
LPS or earth electrode system.

Simultaneous Detonation—The detonation of two or more items that are near each other, with
one item detonating after the next, and with such short intervals between detonations, that the
overall detonation appears to have emanated from a single item. Pressures produced by these
independent detonations grow together (coalesce) within very short distances from their sources
to cause peak overpressures greater than that of each independent source. Preventing
simultaneous detonation is equivalent to providing intermagazine distance.

Single-Chamber Storage Site—An excavated chamber with its own access to the natural
ground surface that is not connected to any other storage chamber.

Source Emission Limits—The amount of toxic chemical agent that may be released at a
particular point that allows for natural dilution, ventilation, and meteorological conditions.

grounded structural elements.

Substantial Dividing Walls—These walls are normally used between bays to prevent
propagation of an explosion from one bay to the other. They provide limited personnel
protection. They are made of reinforced concrete at least 12 inches thick. The reinforcing
consists of #4 bars (1/2 inch), or larger, on 12 inch centers each way on each wall face. The bars
on the two wall faces are staggered with respect to each other. For example, vertical bars on one
face start 12 inches from the end and on the other face they start 6 inches from the end.
Similarly, horizontal bars on one face start 12 inches from the floor and on the other face they
start 6 inches from the floor.

Support Facilities—Facilities that support AE operations (e.g., field offices, AE support
equipment maintenance, forklift charging stations, dunnage storage, or inert storage buildings).

Surge Suppression/Protection—The attenuation, suppression or diversion of lightning induced
electrical energy to ground.

Suspect Truck and Railcar Holding Areas—A designated location for placing motor vehicles
or railcars either containing AE that are suspected of being in a hazardous condition or motor
vehicles or railcars that may be in a condition that is hazardous to the AE.

Operations and Storage Facility, or an explosives operating facility. It provides a work location
for test team personnel who are directly supporting the day-to-day operations, which involve
explosive components.

Toxic Chemical Agent—A substance that is intended for military use with lethal or
incapacitating effects upon personnel through its chemical properties. Excluded from toxic
chemical agents for purposes of this Standard are riot control agents, chemical herbicides,
smoke- and flame-producing items, and individual dissociated components of toxic chemical
agent munitions.

Toxic Chemical Agent Accident—Any unintentional or uncontrolled release of a toxic
chemical agent when, as follows:

       1. Reportable damage occurs to property from contamination, or costs are incurred for
       decontamination.

       2. Individuals exhibit physiological symptoms of toxic chemical agent exposure.

       3. The toxic chemical agent quantity released to the atmosphere is such that a serious
       potential for exposure is created by exceeding the applicable AEL for unprotected
       workers or the general public or property.

chamber or a series of connected chambers and other protective construction features. The
chambers may be either excavated or natural geological cavities.
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                       459


Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance which has been primed, fuzed, armed or
otherwise prepared for action, and which has been fired, dropped, launched, projected or placed
in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel or material and
remains unexploded either by malfunction or design or for any other cause.

Unit Risk—The risk to personnel or facilities that is associated with debris, fragment or blast
hazards that is the result of the detonation of a single round of AE.

United States (US)—The States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa; and the Commonwealth of The Northern
Mariana Islands, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Island, Nassau Island, Palmyra Island,
Wake Island and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction,
and associated navigable waters, contiguous zones, and ocean waters of which the natural
resources are under the exclusive management authority of the United States.

Unoccupied Facility—A facility where personnel are not usually present. Includes magazines,
unmanned sewerage treatment plants, hardened aircraft shelters, etc. An unoccupied facility may
at any given time have personnel present. (See occupied facility.)

Utilities—Utilities include water, natural gas, steam, air lines, electrical lines, communication
lines and environmental facilities or equipment. The term ―Utility‖ does not apply to services
provided to individual or group explosives facilities when that service is not also secondarily
provided to other parts of the installation or community (this includes underground POL lines
servicing hardened aircraft shelters).

Vulnerable Construction—Buildings of vulnerable construction (e.g., schools, high-rise buildings,
restaurants, large warehouse-type retail stores) are of three main types:

       1. Buildings of curtain wall construction that have four stories or more and are
       constructed with external non-load bearing panels on a separate sub-frame that are
       supported off the structural frame or floors for the full height of the building.

       2. Buildings of largely glass construction that have four stories or more and have at least
       50 % of their wall areas glazed.

       3. The third type of vulnerable construction is impracticable to define precisely. This
       covers any large building that employs non load-bearing cladding panels. Definition of
       this type of construction cannot be more precise because of the variation in types of
       modern structures

Warehouse—These are facilities for storing material and supplies where personnel are
infrequently present. The material may, or may not be associated with ammunition and
explosives. Facilities must be sited as warehouses if they are used to store inert munitions
components which are part of the accountable munitions stockpile.

Waste Military Munition—Military munitions are waste when they are solid or hazardous
waste under the regulations (42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq., reference (ao)) implementing the Resource
 460                                                         AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subpart EE of Part 264 of 40 CFR, reference (am), or
defined as a waste under a DoD Component’s written procedures. Waste military munitions are
defined in Section 266.202 of 40 CFR, reference (am).

Note: Decisions about whether specific munitions are or are not waste should be made with
reference to Section 260.10 and Sections 266.200 through 266.206 of 40 CFR, reference (am).

       1. An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs:

       1.1. The munition is abandoned by being disposed of, burned, detonated (except during
       intended use), incinerated, or treated before disposal;

       1.2. The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area
       for the purpose of being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or treated prior to disposal;

       1.3. The munition is deteriorated or damaged (e.g., the integrity of the munition is
       compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot be put into
       serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes; or,

       1.4. An authorized military official has declared the munition a solid

       Note: Declaration by an ―authorized military official‖ that munitions are waste (Section
266.202(b)(4) of 40 CFR, reference (am)) has a very limited meaning and applicability. The
only example is a declaration by the Army in 1984 that M55 rockets are waste. The
Environmental Protection Agency expects that such a declaration would be in writing. A
decision that munitions are unserviceable, or that they are to be transferred into a demilitarization
account does not, by itself, constitute a decision that the munitions are solid waste.

       2. A used or fired military munition is a solid waste, if as follows:

       2.1. When transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is not a
       range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment before
       disposal; or,

       2.2. If recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or land filling either on or off
       a range.

       3. For the RCRA (Section 1004(27) of reference (am)), a used or fired military munition
       is a solid waste, and, therefore, is potentially subject to RCRA corrective action
       authorities under Section 3004(u) and 3004(v), and 3008 (h) of reference (am), or,
       imminent and substantial endangerment authorities under Section 7003, of reference (am)
       if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved. Any
       imminent and substantial threats associated with any remaining material must be
       addressed. If remedial action is not possible, the operator of the range must maintain a
       record of the event for as long as any threat remains. The record must include the type of
AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011                                                                     461


       munition and its location (to the extent the location is known). (For further clarification
       see 40 CFR Section 266.202 of reference (am) under ―Definition of Solid Waste.‖)
       waste.


Wharf—A landing place or platform built into the water or along the shore for the berthing of
vessels.

Wharf Yard—An AE area close to a pier or wharf where railcars or trucks are temporarily held
in support of pier or wharf operations.

Wingwall—A wall located on either side of an ECM's headwall. It may slope to the ground or
may join a wingwall from an adjacent ECM. It may be monolithic (of single construction) or
separated by expansion joints from the headwall. The purpose of a wingwall is to retain the earth
fill along the side slope of an ECM.

With its own means of initiation—An AE item with its normal initiating device, such as a
detonator or detonating fuze, assembled to it or packed with it, and this device is considered to
present a significant risk during storage and transport, but not one great enough to be
unacceptable.

Without its own means of initiation—An AE item without its normal initiating device
assembled to it or packed with it. The term also applies to an AE item packed with its initiating
device, provided the device is packed so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the AE
item in the event of accidental functioning of the initiating device. In addition, the term applies
to an AE item assembled with its initiating device provided there are protective features such that
the initiating device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the AE item under conditions that are
associated with storage and transport. For hazard classification purposes, a means of initiation
that possesses two independent effective protective features is not considered to present a
significant risk of causing the detonation of an AE item under conditions associated with storage
and transport.

Zone of protection—The space beneath the LPS that is substantially immune to direct lightning.

SUBJECT: Explosives Site Plan (ESP) Submission, ATC-LOWRY-10-S001, WITH
EXCEPTIONS, Above Ground Magazine (AGM) 433, Lowry Air Force Base, CO

1. Request routine processing and final approval of subject site plan for increasing net
explosives weight for quantity distance (NEWQD) limits for an existing AGM. Once approved,
this ESP replaces ESP ATC-LOWRY-87-S008. This facility does not comply with all
explosives safety standards. There are exceptions associated with this ESP. This ESP has been
coordinated with the base comprehensive plan; there are no future plans that impact this ESP.
The following information is provided for analysis purposes.

        a. This ESP sites an AGM for storage of AE. The requested NEWQD for each hazard
division (HD) is as follows:
   Facility      HD 1.1      HD 1.2.1     HD 1.2.2        HD 1.2.3        HD 1.3       HD 1.4

       b. The attached AF Form 943 and map documents all paired potential explosion site
(PES) and exposed site relationships within the inhabited building distance (IBD) clear zone.

       c. This ESP was accomplished using Assessment System for Hazard Surveys II, Version
2480, Database 60.

        d. The required evaluation zone (EZ) of 874 feet falls within the IBD clear zone,
therefore is not depicted on the location map. The EZ was based on K11 for 500,000 pounds
NEWQD of HD 1.1 in accordance with AFMAN 91-201, Table 14.1.

        e. A glass breakage survey determined there are occupied facilities containing windows
within IBD of this magazine. Analyses revealed no risk to personnel from glass breakage.
Detailed analyses are attached.

        f. There are no electro-magnetic radiation hazards to AE at this magazine.

    g. A lightning protection system (LPS) is installed. The LPS meets all criteria within
AFMAN 91-201, Chapter 5. Drawings are attached.

      h. Mixing quantities of HD 1.1, 1.2.x and 1.3 AE will comply with the requirements of
DoD 6055.9-M, Volume 1.

MEMORANDUM FOR AF/SE

SUBJECT: SECAF Exemption to Explosives Quantity-Distance Standards at Aviano AB
Allowing for Construction of a US Army Heavy Drop Rigging Complex
Commanders in United States Air Forces in Europe and United States Army Europe are required
to enhance the support of joint DoD operations during times of contingency. To this end, the US
Army has asked to build a new Heavy Drop Rigging Complex (HDRC) at Aviano AB to enhance
173rd Airborne Brigade deployment activities. The proposed eight construction projects
associated with this complex are less than the required explosives quantity-distance separation
standards prescribed in DoD 6055.09-M and AFMAN 91-201 for 44 paired relationship
explosives safety evaluations.
The departures from the safety standards involve insufficient separation between the proposed
structures and the installation boundary and between USAF and USA explosives and non-
explosives locations. The most serious of these departures is to the base boundary. Italian
civilians in fields adjacent to the base boundary are at risk of death should an explosive mishap
occur at either of the US Army HDRC explosives structures. Although the fields adjacent to the
base boundary are currently used for agriculture, and are infrequently occupied by civilians,
residential or business development of this land would increase the number of civilians in harm’s
way. It is my understanding, however, that a restrictive easement has been approved by the
Italian regional panel limiting civilian exposure to risk by freezing use of the land at current
levels, and prohibiting future development.
After due consideration, I find that compelling operational requirements necessitate deviation
from Department of Defense Explosives Quantity-Distance standards with regard to the location
of a new US Army HDRC at Aviano AB. Based on the concurrence provided by the highest US
Army approval authority for explosives safety exemptions, DASA (I & E), and the absence of
viable alternatives, I conclude that exemptions for the US Army HDRC are appropriate, and
approve the start of this US Army-funded project.

I hereby approve the exemptions for the eight US Army HDRC locations. Permanent copies of
this memorandum will be maintained at AFSC, USAFE, and Aviano AB. This exemption will
be reviewed every five years at the appropriate level for the continued use of this exception in
accordance with AFMAN 91-201 and to verify the continued accuracy of the risk assessment
provided.

MEMORANDUM FOR AF/SE

SUBJECT: SECAF Exemption to Explosives Quantity-Distance Standards at Osan AB
Allowing for Construction of Fighter Squadron Operations/ Aircraft Maintenance Facility
Addition

Commanders in Korea have a requirement to enhance the support of combat aircraft operations
during times of contingency and wartime operations. As a result, the expansion of aircraft
support facility 1702 is required to enhance the 51st Fighter Wing’s ability to maintain combat
assets.

         Based on the proposed expansion location and its proximity to three nearby 3rd generation
hardened aircraft shelters, the required explosives quantity-distance separation standards as
prescribed in AFMAN 91-201 are not met. As a result, personnel and assets located in the
facility could be subjected to blast overpressure and fragmentation far in excess of those
prescribed during exercise and contingency operations. Should a mishap occur at the closest of
the three aircraft shelters, consequences to the building 1702 expansion could include up to five
fatalities, serious injuries, mission interruption, and up to $500,000 in damage.

        I have weighed the need for the need for the 25th fighter squadron operations/aircraft
maintenance facility expansion at Osan AB against the expected impact in the event of a mishap.
In the absence of available alternatives, I conclude that an exemption for the construction of the
aircraft support facility expansion is appropriate, and approve the expenditure of construction
funds.

Permanent copies of this memorandum will be maintained at AFSC, HQ PACAF, and Osan AB.
This exemption will be reviewed every five years at the appropriate level for the continued use of
this exception in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.

                          QD GUIDANCE FOR ON-BASE ROADS

A5.1. In order to prevent the generation of a significant number of quantity-distance
exemptions, DoD 6055.09-M requirements allow the DoD components to establish procedures
for assessing, documenting, and accepting the risks associated with application of QD criteria to
on-base roads for on-base road relationships which existed prior to 1 Oct 00. QD criteria is
based on the traffic density (PTR or IBD). After 1 Oct 00, any changes to a PES which increase
its QD arc, construction of a new PES, or construction of a new on-base road, will require
application of QD criteria to on-base roads which are traveled by personnel not involved in
munitions related operations. If QD criteria cannot be met, the formal exemption requirements
of AFMAN 91-201 must be followed.
A5.2. For those sited (DDESB- or AFSC-approved or MAJCOM baseline-approved) PES/on-
base road relationships which existed prior to 1 Oct 00, we require the following risk assessment
and documentation be accomplished:
   A5.2.1. On a copy of the installation map, identify the following:
       A5.2.1.1. All PESs having QD arcs (PTR or IBD based on traffic density) encompassing
       on-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions-related operations.
       A5.2.1.2. The Net Explosives Weight for Quantity-Distance (NEWQD) of the above
       PESs.
       A5.2.1.3. The applicable QD arcs (PTR or IBD) of the above PESs based on the traffic
       density.
       A5.2.1.4. The segments of the applicable on-base roads which pass through the above
       arcs.
   A5.2.2. Perform a risk assessment of the relationships shown above in accordance with Risk
   Management procedures. Some factors that might be considered include:
       A5.2.2.1. Operational necessity.
       A5.2.2.2. The operation being performed (e.g., static storage, maintenance, and
       production).
       A5.2.2.3. Operational activity cycles.
       A5.2.2.4. Alternate routes.
       A5.2.2.5. Traffic density.
       A5.2.2.6. Accident records.
       A5.2.2.7. Time interval of exposure.
       A5.2.2.8. Type and quantity of munitions in proximity to the area transited.
       A5.2.2.9. The closest distance from the area transited to the PES.
       A5.2.2.10. The need for installation-related personnel to transit the ESQD arc.
 468                                                      AFMAN91-201 12 JANUARY 2011


   A5.2.3. Document the commander’s risk acceptance through a formal memorandum and
   review upon change of the approval authority. This memorandum must include the map
   showing the relationships for which he/she is accepting risk, a summary of the risk
   assessment, and a statement that the subject relationships existed as of 1 Oct 00.
A5.3. It is highly recommended that the above risk assessment and documentation be
accomplished to accurately capture the relationships, which existed as of 1 Oct 00, and to avoid
DDESB survey findings. The commander’s risk acceptance and attached map must be included
in amendments to site plans (for PESs which existed prior to 1 Oct 00), or referenced if
previously submitted with another site plan amendment, which do not increase the QD arc. As
stated previously, after 1 Oct 00, any changes to a PES which increase its QD arc, construction
of a new PES, construction of a new on-base road, or increased traffic density will require
application of QD criteria to on-base roads which are traveled by personnel not involved in
munitions related operations (see paragraph 12.16.)
