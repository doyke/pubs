    Training (AiT) instructional purposes. Refer to Attachment 2 for 82/782 TRG areas of
    responsibility when conducting the FOD Walk. The GITA ramp is a training area, and
    therefore is not subject to maintenance requirements associated with an operational flight
    line. Rocks and broken cement will not be a primary concern during the GITA ramp FOD
    walk (due to ramp condition) and are not required to be picked up during the FOD walk.
    When in use, grounding receptacles will be free of debris. If operational aircraft are placed
    on the GITA ramp, additional actions must be taken to ensure compliance with applicable
    AFIs.
       3.6.1. Inclement weather procedures. FOD walks will be cancelled/terminated or
       rescheduled during inclement weather (i.e., heavy fog, near zero visibility), severe
       temperatures, or when the Command Post announces lightning within five nautical mile
       warnings.
       3.6.2. Prior to any movement of GITA to/from a hangar, the applicable training squadron
       will conduct a FOD walk in the path of the tow.
