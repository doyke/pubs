This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 20-1/63-1, Integrated Life Cycle
Management. It contains Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Purchase Instrument (PI)
policy for the generation and processing of Purchase Requests (PR), Delivery Order Requests
(DOR) and amendments on the AFMC Form 36 Purchase Request, AFMC specific guidance for
incoming and outgoing Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) (DD Form 448)
and MIPR Acceptances (DD Form 448-2), and other equivalent electronic reports or documents
needed to develop and procure computed and stand-alone logistics and acquisition requirements
in support of operational needs as prescribed by. It sets PR/MIPR policy for the central
procurement of sustainment requirements and for the acquisition of consolidated Air Force (AF)
and Department of Defense (DoD)-wide requirements for materiel and services. It pertains to
PRs/MIPRs for consumable parts and reparable spares; support equipment items; repair services
and data purchases; modifications and other services in support of department-wide weapon
system acquisition and sustainment activities.

This instruction applies to all AFMC activities with weapon system acquisition, life cycle
management, or sustainment responsibilities, or activities procuring items or services supporting
research and development or other AFMC or higher level functions. It does not apply to local
purchases for materiel or services required to support base or unit level operational activities.
Local purchase requirements are normally submitted on an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase or
the Government Purchase Card (GPC). This publication does not apply to the Air National
Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It supersedes
AFMC Instruction 23-102, Purchase Request/Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request
Operations.

Major policy changes include the following: mandating Purchase Request Process System
(PRPS) use generating PIs in support of supply chain/sustainment operations in the Air Force
Sustainment Center (AFSC) (excluding PI citing investment dollars identified in AFI 63-101
Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management), including support to AFSC PIs performed
by outside organizations; requiring all PI screening and engineering activities be performed in
PRPS; requiring PIs generated by program offices assigned to Air Force Life Cycle Management
Center (AFLCMC) in support of programs on the Acquisition Master List (AML) or using
funding sources identified in AFI 63-101 be prepared in the Comprehensive, Cost and
Requirements (CCaR) system; establishing the primary AFSC supply chain
management/sustainment organization as the base level purchase instrument process owner and
PR/MIPR Cell as the initial point of entry for MIPRs at Hill, Tinker and Robins; removing
AFMC Form 318 Item Contracting History Record instructions (moving to AFMCMAN 23-1,
Requirements for Secondary Items), equipment managers must refer to AFMCMAN 23-4 for
Form 318 instructions; authorizing use of various PI form versions generated by different PI
systems in field use. Also with the concurrence of the AFI 65-116, Air Force Purchases Using
Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRS) OPR, this publication equates
requirement owners AFI 65-116’s program/project managers and allows for electronic/digital
signatures on MIPRs. Prescribed and adopted forms are listed in Attachment 1. This publication
no longer prescribes the AFMC Form 318.

                                           Chapter 1

                     GENERAL PURCHASE INSTRUMENT POLICY

1.1. Purpose. This instruction prescribes policy guidance for developing logistics and
acquisition requirements into Purchase Instruments (PI) to include: the initiation and processing
of PRs and Delivery Order Requests (DOR) for Air Force managed logistics materiel and
services; initiation of outgoing MIPRs for logistics materiel and services required by the Air
Force, managed and acquired by other government agencies; processing incoming MIPRs for
materiel and services requested from the Air Force by other agencies. This includes equipment,
spares, materiel, contract repair, services, overhauls, modifications, and data requests.
1.2. Precedence. This instruction takes precedence over all other AFMC and lower-level
directives concerning PI processing. This instruction’s content was screened to ensure it was
compliant with higher-level directives and complimentary to other functional guidance.
Apparent conflicts with other directives should be identified to HQ AFMC/A4 for resolution.
1.3. Purchase Instruments (PI). In this instruction the term “Purchase Instrument” or “PI”
refers to a PR/MIPR/DOR/Amendment action. PIs are the product of the actions required to
convert a known requirement into a procurable package containing all the information and
applicable attachments/activities/documents the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) needs to
clearly communicate the requirement to all potential sources and select the item/service that best
meets the DoD’s need.
     1.3.1. Before a PI can be initiated the requirement owner (RO) must perform market
     research, formulate a procurement strategy, and be able to substantiate the requirement’s
     purpose and estimated or known quantity. Purpose consists of stating what the need is, how
     many are needed, where/when they are needed, and if applicable, period of performance.
     This can come from a requirements system, like D200, a programmed depot maintenance
     schedule, identified through an out-of-cycle requisition from the field or un-programmed
     maintenance action or developmental program.
     1.3.2. Electronic PIs. AFMC units are encouraged to generate and route PIs electronically
     from requirement identification through contract award to the maximum degree possible.
     This includes interfacing with the financial system for funds certification, a contracting
     system for requirement solicitation and award, and depending on the item or service, the
     acquisition system for reporting program expenditures. Sustainment support PIs generated
     by the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) citing working capital or non-investment
     funding and awarded through central procurement must be processed in the Purchase Request
     Process System (PRPS). PRPS is a web-based application integrated into the Global Combat
     Support System Air Force (GCSS-AF) framework that automates and standardizes the front
     end of the procurement process for spares, data, or services to support and sustain weapon
     systems. Life-cycle management or product support organizations, assigned to the Air Force
     Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) or AFSC activities using investment funding,
     will use the Comprehensive, Cost and Requirements (CCaR) system to generate PIs for
     program requirements identified on the AML or using investment funding requiring SAF/AQ
     financial reporting through the System Metric and Reporting Tool (SMART) IAW AFI 63-
     101. AFLCMC may opt to use other PI systems for their non-reportable requirements but
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                         9


   must perform support to AFSC PIs generated in PRPS. All other centers may use a
   comparable system to produce PIs as long as they meet the PI guidance prescribed in this
   instruction.
   1.3.3. The PIs are grouped into three general types of purchases:
       1.3.3.1. Item Buy PI. An item buy requests a specific tangible item, generally a stock
       listed item or other materiel needed to support the DoD supply chain, depot operations, or
       product support activities.
       1.3.3.2. Repair PI. A repair PI is used to procure contract repair services for stock listed
       spare parts when the Air Force does not possess the organic capability or capacity to
       perform.
       1.3.3.3. Services or Data PI. These PIs request contract services that support non-stock
       listed items, development/research, advisory and assistance, and engineering assistance,
       or request data to support a weapon system (like technical order data or parts breakdown
       lists), or logistics life-cycle data to initiate requirements computation.
   1.3.4. Manual PIs. When circumstances preclude electronic PI processing, the PI RO will
   use the AFMC Form 36 form to prepare a “manual” PR. The AFMC Forms 36A-F may be
   used to provide additional PR information. Manual MIPRs will be prepared on the DD Form
   448.
   1.3.5. Pen and ink changes. After a PI has been funds certified, pen and ink changes are
   not permitted.
   1.3.6. Associated PI form Versions. Due to the number of systems involved in the PI
   process, and the cost and production lead time to change electronic forms programmed into
   these systems, it is not practical to prescribe a particular form version or have the e-Pubs
   version exactly match the various PI system reports/forms. Therefore, any version of an
   AFMC form that this publication is the prescribing guidance is acceptable as long as it
   contains the data elements and prescribed statements or clauses required by higher guidance
   (such as the FAR). Also, any system report or form reflecting procurement data associated
   with one of AFMC forms is acceptable as long as it provides the prescribed information to
   the Accounting Liaison Officer (ALO)/PCO or finance/contracting system. Prescribed and
   adopted forms are listed in Attachment 1.
1.4. Effective PI Processing. The requirements owner (RO) is responsible for ensuring the
effective processing of the PI, including content. The RO must take prompt and appropriate
action to properly coordinate and resolve issues affecting PI timeliness and accuracy. AFMC
Centers are responsible for developing procedural guidance to implement the policy set in this
instruction and establish the step-by-step instructions for the forms/reports produced by their
systems. These instructions must include degraded operation procedures as a contingency if
their system goes down for an extended time or during urgent situations and also a process for
approving emergency/urgent PIs. These procedures must also include provisions for physically
handling PI containing classified information, if applicable. Security procedures may be
delegated to the complex or operating location to account for local security capability. All
Center-level PI guidance must be coordinated through the AFMC A4 policy OPR.
 10                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


1.5. DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program Compliance. The DoD Coordinated Acquisition
Program directs single-service procurement of common-use items for all DoD users. This
requires the Air Force to source some of its requirements from other government agencies. Refer
to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Procedures Coordinated
Acquisitions Subpart 208.70 for general policy information and DFARS PGI 253.208, Defense
Federal Acquisitions Regulation Supplement Procedures, Guidance & Information for
instructions on preparation and use of DD Form 448, MIPR and DD form 448-2, Acceptance of
MIPR. These requirements will be worked according to the priority assigned by the RO and not
set aside for internal activities.
1.6. Handling Classified PIs and Attachments. Great care is required when processing PIs
containing classified information. PIs with classified information must never be processed in
unclassified systems, e.g. PRPS. It is imperative to comply with the guidance below when
processing classified PIs. However, classified items or repair/service of classified items may be
ordered on a PI in an unclassified system as long as the PI contains no classified information.
   1.6.1. This section is only applicable to personnel authorized to process classified PIs.
       1.6.1.1. The RO must be aware whether prospective offerors or contractors need access
       to classified information during the contract solicitation or performance phases.
       Individuals adding classified attachments or information to a PI must notify the RO prior
       to forwarding or entering in a system to ensure proper security precautions are made.
       1.6.1.2. Classification decisions are based on an Original Classification Authority (OCA)
       determination or classification guides prepared by the System Program Director (SPD)
       (or other single manager) of the affected system or program. In the absence of specific
       guidance, protect potentially classified information as if it is classified, and request
       assistance from the local servicing security agency.
   1.6.2. The following guidance applies when processing PIs with classified information:
       1.6.2.1. If classified information is on the PI or one of its attachments, the PI document
       itself will be stamped top and bottom with the classification level required, and each
       paragraph/block/section will be marked with the classification that applies to that
       information.
       1.6.2.2. The front page of PI packages containing classified information will be stamped
       top and bottom with the highest classification level within the PI package. If there is no
       classified information on that page note “THIS PAGE IS UNCLASSIFIED” in
       parenthesis beneath the classification stamp. Also, each page/paragraph/block/section
       containing classified information within the PI must be marked with the applicable
       classification level.
       1.6.2.3. If the PI package is classified and/or the service requested, information or
       materiel provided, or the item produced by the contractor requires security protection, the
       RO will request a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification from the
       Servicing Security Agency. Refer to DoD 5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation for
       additional guidance on classified solicitations.
           1.6.2.3.1. The DD Form 254 is included in the PI’s supporting technical data and
           alerts the PCO to properly screen prospective offerors for the required security
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                       11


           clearance. The DD Form 254 identifies the information requiring protection and the
           applicable sections of DoD 5220.22-M National Industrial Security Program
           Operating Manual to the PCO and contractor.
   1.6.3. Consult the Unit Security Manager for prescribed procedures for the handling,
   transport, and storage of classified information. Note: Never enter classified information into
   a Non-Secure Data System.
1.7. Limited Distribution of Sensitive Unclassified Information. Certain unclassified
information, such as advance acquisition programming data and requirements, is releasable only
to authorized government personnel. While this information does not fall within the Information
Security Program, personnel handling this information shall ensure no unauthorized disclosures
occur. Information containing militarily sensitive but unclassified technology material is subject
to foreign disclosure limitations. Refer to Sections 1.8, Foreign Disclosure Limitation and 1.9,
Foreign Disclosure Limitation below for more detail.
1.8. Foreign Disclosure. Military information is a national security asset and must be
conserved and protected. It may be shared with foreign representatives only when there is a
clearly defined advantage to the United States. All disclosures and release of military
information and materiel to foreign nationals resulting from international affairs and security
assistance activities must be authorized by the Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO). This includes
the disclosure of Classified Military Information (CMI) and Controlled Unclassified Military
Information (CUMI). The AFMC Form 191, Foreign Disclosure Procurement Decision
Worksheet is used to document PI foreign disclosure reviews.
   1.8.1. Examples of acquisitions requiring FDO review include: those involving Statements
   of Work/Statements of Objective/Performance Work Statements (SOW/SOO/PWS),
   specifications, government property, technical orders, engineering drawings, computer
   hardware/software, and any information, equipment, or media involving storage, retrieval,
   processing, or transmission of information.
   1.8.2. Only information not detrimental to the welfare of the United States (US) Government
   can be released to foreign entities. Any release must be in accordance with DoDI 2040.02,
   International Transfers of Technology, Articles and Services, and AFPD 16-2, Disclosure of
   Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations. Exemptions
   to FDO review must be specifically established by Public Law or DoD Appropriations Acts
   per AFI 16-201, AF Foreign Disclosure & Technology Transfer Program.
1.9. Foreign Disclosure Limitation. Certain information, such as technical data or drawings,
may reveal critical details of militarily sensitive (although unclassified) technology. While this
information must be provided to prospective offerors during the solicitation process, restrictions
exist to prevent a compromise of US security interests. Only the minimum amount of data
required to formulate a bid should be provided during solicitation. Care must be taken to ensure
no US commitment to furnish additional information or materiel is intended or implied until
disclosure is approved.
   1.9.1. The restrictions to prevent a compromise of US security interests may include
   prohibitions against:
       1.9.1.1. Access by foreign national employees of domestic firms;
12                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


     1.9.1.2. Access by any non-US firm;
     1.9.1.3. Access by non-permitted (third country) nationals when allied nation firms are
     permitted or bid;
     1.9.1.4. Subcontracting with a non-permitted firm.
  1.9.2. Prospective offerors either located outside the US or owned (wholly or in part) by
  non-US interests may be ineligible. Therefore, the synopsis package must identify this
  information so the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) advertisement can contain
  the appropriate limitations. Note: This is a critical point even for US offerors, because it may
  restrict their ability to subcontract with their usual foreign-owned subcontractors and
  possibly void the bid.
  1.9.3. Prior to submitting technical data to the contracting agency for synopsis/solicitation,
  the applicable system engineer/equipment specialist will determine if it contains information
  subject to foreign disclosure limitations. The unclassified Militarily Critical Technology List
  (MCTL) is the reference document for identifying technical data not releasable to foreign
  owned/influenced sources.
  1.9.4. Additional restrictions are published in various classified Delegation of Disclosure
  Authority Letters (DDLs). The MCTL and DDLs will be maintained by the center Foreign
  Disclosure Office (FDO) and may be issued to using organizations with a continuing need to
  know and proper storage facilities. Due to the workload, foreign disclosure restrictions add
  to the acquisition process, the engineer and equipment specialist must ensure these
  restrictions are only appropriately applied. The FDO will provide necessary guidance and
  training.
  1.9.5. For spare parts/hardware buys, the identification occurs during the technical screening
  process. The engineers will either confirm the engineering data does not contain foreign
  disclosure restricted information based on the MCTL and/or DDL; or consult with the FDO
  to determine the appropriate restrictions. The determination is reflected in the Export
  Control block on the Screening Analysis Worksheet (AFMC Form 761) and may be further
  explained by the Distribution Code on the Engineering Data List (EDL). Note: Refer to
  AFMCI 21-149, Contract Depot Maintenance (CDM) Program, for Repair Data List (RDL)
  guidance.
  1.9.6. Services and data also require MCTL and/or DDL screening; however, the activity
  originating Performance Work Statement (PWS) or equivalent document must perform the
  screening.
     1.9.6.1. The PWS originator shall consult with the FDO to determine foreign disclosure
     restrictions, then ensure the PWS clearly states whether or not restrictions apply. The
     PWS originator must assess the risks of providing contractors the information and
     security access required to perform work associated with these types of contracts. For
     example, a computer system maintenance contract may not involve working on sensitive
     technology; but in the course of performing maintenance the contractor may have access
     to sensitive system data files. In such cases, foreign disclosure restrictions must be
     applied.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                           13


   1.9.7. Based on the technical determination above, foreign disclosure restrictions will be
   provided with the PI package. The contracting agency will include the necessary notes in the
   synopsis directing prospective offerors to certify the extent of their level of foreign
   ownership/influence that the solicitation package requires. For disclosure of classified and
   unclassified military information to foreign governments and international organizations, the
   PCO will request the FDO to review all foreign owned/influenced prospective offerors’
   requests for solicitation packages. The FDO must review each request on a case-by-case
   basis and advise the PCO of the determination. The RO must aggressively follow-up with
   the FDO (and all others involved in the review) on these requests to prevent acquisition
   delays.
1.10. Requirements for Hazardous Materiel (HAZMAT). Air Force Pollution Prevention
Policy requires requirements and technical personnel minimize HAZMAT use during contract
performance. Even if HAZMAT use appears unavoidable, the solicitation should explicitly
provide      prospective     offerors     the      opportunity     to    propose       less-hazardous
alternatives. HAZMAT(s) are defined in Fed-Std-313, Material Safety Data, Transportation
Data, And Disposal Data, For Hazardous Materials Furnished To Government Activities. Any
used or unused property, including scrap and waste is considered hazardous if its quality,
concentration, physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, causes it to be ignitable, corrosive,
reactive, or toxic. The property can be a solid, liquid, semi-liquid, or contain gas and may cause
or significantly increase the threat of serious illness or mortality. It may also pose a substantial
threat or potential hazard to the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported,
disposed of, or otherwise managed. If a hazardous item is the only option, the RO must include
a data line item and associated Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) for the mandatory
HAZMAT packaging and transportation requirements IAW 49 CFR Parts 100-185 and the
Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part II. HAZMAT packaging must be
developed IAW AFI 24-210_IP, Packaging of Hazardous Material. The 49 CFR and the DTR
prescribe a mandatory training requirement for all personnel performing HAZMAT related
functions. The RO must include a HAZMAT qualified person in developing these requirements.
1.11. Item Unique Identification (IUID). IUID is a DoD program developed to link individual
items to a specific identification number that follows the item throughout the entire product life
cycle. It establishes a means to track a particular asset’s visibility and status, and record and
recall maintenance actions like repairs, modifications and installations from ‘cradle to grave.’
Specific goals are to improve item management and accountability, capture more precise
financial records; and ultimately integrate item data across DoD, Federal and industry asset
management systems to facilitate improved data quality, global interoperability and supply chain
management.
   1.11.1. When requesting repairs or services on items valued at $5,000.00 or more, ROs must
   advise the PCO an IUID is required in the PI package remarks or in an attachment, e.g., IUID
   checklist in PRPS, per DFARS Subpart 211, and 274, Describing Agency Needs – Item
   Identification and Valuation Requirements.
   1.11.2. If the item is worth less than $5,000.00 and the requiring organization determines the
   item warrants IUID registration, the RO will inform the PCO in the PI package remarks.
   Generally, serially managed, mission essential or controlled inventory coded, reparable items
   or equipment will require an IUID. The requiring organization may also require IUIDs on
 14                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   consumable items or materiel and subassemblies, components and parts embedded within an
   item identified on a DD Form 1423, CDRL or other exhibit.
   1.11.3. Refer to DFARS Subpart 211.274; DoD Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items
   Assuring Valuation, Accountability and Control of Government Property; DoDI 8320.04,
   Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property and AFI 63-
   101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, for additional guidance.
1.12. Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). The AF and AFMC implemented this program to
encourage the reduction of hazards and improve working conditions. VPP is under the direction
of Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). VPP requirements are contained in
the PWS and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) for contractors working on an AF
installation on construction and service contracts if the contract requirement exceeds 1000 hours
a quarter. PIs requesting services meeting qualifying conditions may require a VPP checklist as
an attachment. VPP requires review, inclusion of safety requirements, and pre/post award
evaluations. Contractors must manage their own health and safety program. Refer to AF
Contracting VPP Support Guide available at the AF Contracting Knowledge Center Sharepoint
(permissions required) and OSHA Website at http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/index.html for
additional guidance.
1.13. Determining PI Priority. Careful consideration and discretion must be used when
determining PI priorities. If every PI is prioritized as an emergency or urgent, none will receive
expedited handling. The RO will add the Acquisition Lead Time (AQLT) to the anticipated PI
initiation date to determine the expected “routine” delivery date or performance start date and
compare this date to the actual need date to determine the proper PI Priority Code. Priority codes
are defined below. The circumstances supporting PI priority A, B, C, and D use also can support
an "unusual or compelling need" for Other Than Full and Open Competition (OTF&OC)
acquisitions if the unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition. Note: The priority
applies to all line items on the PI; requirements with different priorities must be submitted on
separate PIs.
   1.13.1. To ensure Emergency and Urgent processing is warranted, a senior unit level
   logistician/acquisition professional must validate the priority. Each center must establish an
   approval process in their procedural guidance or policy memorandum and designate an O-
   6/GS-15 or above as approval authority for each base or operating location (OL). The
   base/OL approval authority may delegate this responsibility in writing to a limited amount of
   responsible personnel relative to the size and mission of the organization to ensure timely
   responsiveness to critical warfighter requirements.
   1.13.2. Emergency Requirements. Emergencies carry such an exceptional degree of
   urgency that they must be expedited through the system for immediate action and should be
   applied under very limited circumstances to resolve/prevent a very near term immediate
   requirement for a specific quantity. The conditions elevating the requirement to emergency
   status and RO rationale must be documented in a Priority Approval Letter and approved by
   the designated authority. This letter must clearly state why urgent/routine acquisition
   processes cannot sufficiently meet the affected mission.
       1.13.2.1. Priority Code “A”. Use of priority code A is strictly controlled and limited to
       Mission Capable (MICAP) conditions to satisfy requirements for inoperative weapons
       systems engaged in combat or combat support missions, to include aircraft in a combat
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     15


     theater, or bomber, tanker, and airlift assets that could be tasked to perform theater
     missions. Also, MICAPs for weapon systems scheduled to rotate into the theater within
     30 days or MICAPs dropping units below their ability to perform most of their assigned
     designed operational capability mission qualify. This extends to the related Aerospace
     Ground Equipment (AGE), munitions, munitions support equipment (SE) supporting
     those types of weapon systems and/or other compelling circumstances like engine line
     stoppages, or scheduled or unscheduled aircraft maintenance and production line
     stoppages at depot level that, if not performed, will prevent or delay mission
     accomplishment.
     1.13.2.2. The emergency quantity ordered should not exceed the bare minimum needed
     to sustain operations until a lower priority procurement can be delivered. The PI quantity
     will not exceed the total of current Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)/ Mission
     Capable Supply (MICAP) backorders and/or other known, definite, documented
     emergency requirements. The package must identify the applicable tail/serial number and
     contain a list of current MICAP backorders.
  1.13.2.2.1. Other projected requirements (e.g. anticipated NMCS/MICAP backorders) must
  not be included in this total since those requirements may not occur. However, as actual
  back orders occur the projected lower priority requirements may be placed on an AFMC
  Form 200, Accelerated Delivery Request (ADR)/direct shipment along with priority code A
  items. Refer to center level procedural guidance to Form 200 preparation instructions.
     1.13.2.3. If manual processing is required, these requirements must be hand carried
     through the process for immediate attention by each functional area.
     1.13.2.4. Due to the fluid nature of emergency situations, the RO must confirm a buy
     requirement award prior to a contract execution. Emergency PIs require the remark:
     "Requires Revalidation Prior to Contract Award" to prompt the PCO to solicit
     incremental pricing and ask the RO to revalidate the quantity/cost prior to contract award.
     1.13.2.5. The PCO will place priority code A requirements on contract in the most
     expeditious manner authorized by the FAR, IAW to their functional guidance.
  1.13.3. Urgent Requirements. Priority codes B-D are considered Urgent. Urgent purchase
  quantities will not exceed the total of current NMCS/MICAP backorders and/or other known,
  definite, documented urgent requirements. However, requirements expected during the
  AQLT can be added, but serviceable assets generated from repair and assets due in from
  open contracts during the AQLT must be subtracted. The conditions elevating the
  requirement to urgent status must be documented in an Urgent Justification Statement and
  approved by the designated authority. This statement must clearly outline why routine
  acquisition processes cannot sufficiently meet the affected mission.
     1.13.3.1. Priority Code “B”. Priority Code B applies to PIs written to satisfy Non-
     Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)/MICAP backorders and critical repairs/services and
     are considered equivalent to the urgency of NMCS/MICAP backorders not meeting the
     Priority A criteria.
         1.13.3.1.1. If the item required is under production, in-route, or on-hand awaiting
         maintenance action in support of a depot production line for a weapon system or
         subsystem acquisition program, the RO will contact the acquisition PM and negotiate
16                                                            AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


        diverting the assets to satisfy the field NMCS/MICAP requirement. The RO will also
        notify the acquisition program contracting office and the program management office
        involved that a high priority request is in route.
        1.13.3.1.2. The package must identify the applicable tail/serial number and contain a
        list of current MICAP backorders.
     1.13.3.2. Priority Code “C”. Priority Code C applies to PIs satisfying Military
     Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedure (MILSTRIP)/Military Standard Transaction
     Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP) priority 1-3 backorders.
        1.13.3.2.1. The package must list all priority 1-3 backorders.
     1.13.3.3. Priority Code “D”. Priority code D applies to PIs for items with critical
     delivery schedules affecting scheduled repair/overhaul production lines, safety of flight,
     or ground safety items (when delay in delivery causes an unacceptable risk increase) or
     PIs for other special acquisition or sustainment programs not meeting priority code A, B,
     or C criteria, or have priority 1-3 backorders.
        1.13.3.3.1. Applies to repair/overhaul or service requirement meeting public
        exigency negotiation criteria or qualifies as an Electronic Warfare Quick Reaction
        Capability (EWQRC) priority.
        1.13.3.3.2. The package must contain a list of current backorders.
     1.13.3.4. Due to the fluid nature of urgent situations, the RO must confirm a buy
     requirement award prior to contract execution. Urgent PIs require the remark: "Requires
     Revalidation Prior to Contract Award" to prompt the PCO to solicit incremental
     pricing and ask the RO to revalidate the quantity/cost prior to contract award.
  1.13.4. Routine Requirements. Routine requirements will meet mission needs without
  expedited processing.
     1.13.4.1. Priority Code “E”. Priority code E applies to PIs for items with need dates
     less than the AQLT.
        1.13.4.1.1. No MICAPS or backorders exist. No justification is needed other than
        identifying the need date is prior to the AQLT.
     1.13.4.2. Priority Code “R”. Priority Code “R” applies to PIs for items with need dates
     that are AQLT away.
        1.13.4.2.1. No MICAPS or backorders exist. No justification is needed other than
        identifying the need date equals the AQLT.
  1.13.5. Accelerated Delivery Requests (ADR). When the mission dictates a required
  delivery date be expedited on an awarded requirement, the following applies:
     1.13.5.1. If the item is on only one PI, the RO must prepare and forward an AFMC Form
     200, Accelerated Delivery Request (ADR) to the contracting agency.
     1.13.5.2. The ADR includes all necessary data such as PR/MIPR number, contract
     number, and quantity to meet emergency requirements, deadline priority, Not Mission
     Capable Supply (NMCS), plus other data deemed necessary. A shipping instruction
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                        17


       amendment must be processed concurrently with the ADR if all or a portion of the
       accelerated quantity must be shipped to a destination other than the current destination.
       1.13.5.3. If the item is on multiple contracts, the PCO determines which contract to
       accelerate delivery on and notifies the requiring organization to amend the applicable
       shipping instructions.
       1.13.5.4. The feasibility of accelerating a delivery is difficult to predict. In some cases,
       the contractor may be willing and able to deliver early with minimal effort and no
       additional charge to the government. In other cases, the contractor may be struggling to
       meet the original schedule and totally incapable of accelerating the requirement (whether
       willing or not). Other times, some contractors may be able to accelerate the schedule if
       provided additional resources and incentives through premium funding. Because ADR
       requests involve considerable effort by both the requiring and the contracting activities
       that may not result in any gain or may require additional funds, Center-level controls
       must ensure that ADRs are used only where truly warranted. ADRs should not be issued
       until 60 days after contract award.
           1.13.5.4.1. PI ROs will not initiate or process priority "R" PIs when they know an
           accelerated delivery schedule is needed. They will use the appropriate PI priority and
           need date to tell the PCO the best possible delivery schedule should be negotiated.
       1.13.5.5. Upon receipt of the ADR, the PCO determines if an ADR is feasible. The
       following factors must be considered:
           1.13.5.5.1. Whether the contractor had sufficient time to receive the contract,
           establish an actual production schedule, and arrange for delivery of materials, hence
           the 60-day waiting period.
1.13.5.5.2. Whether the contract has a negotiated firm delivery schedule (ADRs are usually
inappropriate for contracts that do not reflect a firm delivery schedule).
           1.13.5.5.3. Whether the contract delivery schedule already reflects a best
           effort/premium funds position (ADRs are inappropriate for these contracts unless
           enough time passes to allow the contractor's situation to possibly change and allow
           increased acceleration).
1.14. Competition Policy. Air Force policy requires AFMC to award purchases and contracts
competitively whenever possible, Unless there is a legal exception. The Air Force objective is to
obtain the best technical solutions, quality, schedule, and price possible on the open market.
Competition policy is based on Public Law 98-369, Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 as
implemented in the FAR and its supplements. Compliance is mandatory. USAF and AFMC
procedural guidance implementing the competition policies were developed to provide as much
flexibility as possible and still comply with the law. Refer to FAR Part 6, Competition
Requirements for guidance on competition requirements. For Advisory and Assistance Services
(A&AS) refer to FAR Subpart 37.2, Advisory and Assistance Services. For Exceptions to
Competition, refer to FAR Part 6.2, Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources.
   1.14.1. Full and Open Competition (F&OC). The FAR defines F&OC as an acquisition
   process that permits all responsible sources to compete. F&OC refers to the procurement
 18                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   process approach, not the solicitation results. Written documentation may also be required if
   awarding a contract using full and open competition after exclusion of one or more sources.
   1.14.2. Other Than Full and Open Competition (OTF&OC). Any purchase action not
   meeting F&OC criteria are considered OTF&OC. “Limited” competition (such as the
   government has two or more qualified sources but lacks the data to qualify any others) is
   considered OTF&OC. If awarding a contract under OTF&OC procedures, some form of
   written documentation is normally required. Depending on the authority used, the specific
   form of written documentation will vary. Refer to AFFARS MP5306.304, Approval for
   Justification for additional guidance.
   1.14.3. When Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requests or requisitions generating the PI are
   placed under authority of AFFARS 5306.302-4 (c), a Letter of Offer and
   Acceptance/International Agreement Competitive Restriction (LOA/IACR), which limits the
   source(s) to be solicited, is prepared in lieu of a J&A. Refer to DFARS 206.302-3, Other
   Than Full and Open Competition for additional guidance. The IACR are approved the PCO
   regardless of dollar value. Refer to DFARS 206.302-1 through-7, Other than Full and Open
   Competition for special circumstances/authority allowing OTF&OC for Industrial
   Mobilization, Authorized or Required by Statute, National Security, and Public Interest. Cite
   the applicable authority on the J&A, unless exempted.
   1.14.4. The FAR Part 13 directs agencies to use Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to
   the maximum extent practicable for all purchases of supplies or services not exceeding the
   Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) (currently $150,000). The FAR exempts SAP
   acquisitions from F&OC requirements, but permits sole sourcing only if the contracting
   officer determines only one source is reasonably available and priced. If the requiring
   organization wants the PCO to consider sole sourcing they should submit a Sole Source
   Justification (SSJ) with the PI.
1.15. Screening and Engineering Activities. All PI screening and engineering
activities/functions in support of weapons system supply chain operations at Robins, Tinker, and
Hill AFBs are required to be performed in PRPS. PRPS acts as a central repository for this
information.
   1.15.1. Activities must be performed on the form noted and include, but are not limited to:
       1.15.1.1. Screening Analysis Worksheets (SAW) (AFMC Form 761) and Contract
       Repair Screening Analysis Worksheets (CRSAW) (AFMC Form 762).
       1.15.1.2. Engineering and Repair Data Lists (EDL/RDL). The RDL must be recorded on
       an AFMC Form 762A, the EDL is an off-line report or PRPS activity.
       1.15.1.3. Identifying first article requirements (AFMC Form 260); documenting surplus
       materiel assessments (AFMC Form 813); and recommending quality assurance
       provisions and special inspection requirements (AFMC for 807); and applicable Item
       Descriptions.
   1.15.2. This includes services performed in support of DLA NSN buys when the AF is the
   technical authority, and NSN screening support performed by personnel located at other
   bases.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      19


   1.15.3. Support to PIs generated in another system (e.g. CCaR) for non-NSN may be
   performed on off-line forms or documents and uploaded into the applicable PI system.
   1.15.4. If changes to screening or engineering functions or procedures require corresponding
   system changes, a requirement must be defined and a change request submitted to the PRPS
   functional or program management office (PMO).
1.16. Multi-Functional Team (MFT) Acquisition Concept. Unless another strategic
procurement plan, like a Commodity Council strategic contract is used, the command
expectation is AFMC weapon system acquisition and sustainment procurements will be managed
using a multi-functional approach. These teams should, to the largest degree practicable, have
representation from the key players and every functional area involved in acquiring or sustaining
the weapon system (e.g. Program Manager; Item or Materiel Manager (IM/MM), Production
Management Specialist (PMS), maintenance, engineering, packaging, transportation, contracting,
center test authority and financial, etc.). MFTs can be organized on Contract Buy Teams (CBT),
Contract Repair Teams (CRT)/Contract Maintenance Review Boards (CMRB) or Contract
Engineering Teams (CET) depending on the nature of the procurement action. Each center will
document how the MFT approach is employed in their center-level procedural guidance. If an
actual MFT does not provide the optimal procurement strategy for a particular commodity, the
Center must identify the items/services and units exempted and provide rationale in their
procedural guidance or elsewhere. However, those units must be able to demonstrate how they
incorporate the concept of multi-functional collaboration in their procurement process.

   issues overlapping other functional areas, primarily AFMC/FM and PK.
   2.2.3. Provides functional guidance for logistics engineering and screening functions and
   policy to assure PI packages contain accurate technical data for spare parts and contract
   repair acquisitions to ensure reliability and quality.
       2.2.3.1. Spare part acquisition functions include: providing quality assurance
       instructions, resolving technical authority/data issues, assessing surplus materiel
       applicability; assigning Acquisition Method Codes (AMC)/Acquisition Method Suffix
       Codes (AMSC); providing applicable Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) and Data
       Item Description (DID) and Engineering Data Lists (EDL) information to PI packages;
       and assisting in provisioning and cataloging actions.
       2.2.3.2. Contract maintenance functions include: quality assurance, technical
       authority/data issues; Repair Method Code (RMC)/Repair Method Suffix Code (RMSC)
       assignments; providing applicable CDRL and DID and Repair Data Lists (RDL)
       information to PI packages; ensuring requirement documents are performance-based
       prior to contract award; and Government Furnished Materiel/Property/Equipment
       (GFM/P/E) or special test (ST) equipment determinations.
   2.2.4. Performs portfolio management for PI systems funded by logistics agencies, including
   the Purchase Request Process System (PRPS).
       2.2.4.1. Manages PRPS requirements formulation and testing process until the system
       reaches a state of operational maturity where the AFSC can assume responsibility.
2.3. Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). The AFSC:
   2.3.1. Is designated the PI functional process owner at the Air Logistics Complexes (ALC).
   2.3.2. Will establish an effective means to receive, produce, and control PR/MIPR/DORs
   and associated documents processed at each location to maximize PI resource utilization and
   minimize process redundancy.
   2.3.3. Will oversee base-level PI operations to ensure compliance with this instruction and
   establishes consistent management control at AFMC’s primarily PI generating bases.
       2.3.3.1. Will maintain a PR/MIPR Cell/review function to verify PI package contents are
       complete, reviewed by the required offices and approved by the appropriate authority
       prior to release for funds certification and contracting action. Refer to paragraph 2.11 for
       more detail.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                       21


       2.3.3.2. Will coordinate Center-level procedural documents with AFMC/A4 and affected
       AFLCMC units.
   2.3.4. Will automate PI processing to the greatest degree possible maximizing PRPS
   functionality on applicable PIs.
   2.3.5. Will provide functional support to PRPS system sustainment activities.
       2.3.5.1. Will manage PRPS system change requirements formulation, review, submission
       and testing after full sustainment is reached.
   2.3.6. Will provide PI process and PRPS operations training.
2.4. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC):
   2.4.1. Will execute an effective means to receive, produce, and control PR/MIPRs and
   associated documents processed at each Operating Location (OL).
   2.4.2. Will coordinate/collaborates with the AFSC on OL PI procedural and training issues
   crossing organizational lines.
   2.4.3. Will oversee subordinate OL PI functions to ensure compliance with this instruction.
   2.4.4. Will automate PI processing to the greatest degree possible.
   2.4.5. Will utilize the PI system most advantageous for their operational and reporting
   requirements. AFLCMC units should use the Comprehensive, Cost and Requirement
   (CCaR) system to generate PIs supporting programs or projects requiring financial reporting
   to SAF/AQ through the System Metric and Reporting Tool, and may either use CCaR or
   PRPS to generate PIs for non-reportable requirements.
       2.4.5.1. However, AFLCMC screening and engineering activities in support of AFSC
       PRPS generated PIs and DLA NSN buys must be performed in PRPS
   2.4.6. Will utilize a PR/MIPR Cell/review function to verify PI package contents are
   complete, reviewed by the required offices and approved by the appropriate authority prior to
   release for funds certification and contracting action. Refer to paragraph 2.11 for more
   detail.
2.5. All other AFMC Centers. All other AFMC centers:
   2.5.1. Execute an effective means to receive, produce, and control PR/MIPRs and associated
   documents processed at each location.
   2.5.2. Oversee subordinate units PI functions to ensure compliance with this instruction.
   2.5.3. Will automate PI processing to the greatest degree possible.
   2.5.4. Are authorized use of any available PI processing system.
   2.5.5. Will utilize a PR/MIPR Cell/review function to verify PI package contents are
   complete, reviewed by the required offices and approved by the appropriate authority prior to
   release for funds certification and contracting action. Refer to paragraph 2.11 for more
   detail.
2.6. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). DFAS is the DoD accounting agency
that works closely with the Accounting Liaison Office (ALO) to ensure payment, propriety and
 22                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


accounting records accuracy. DFAS receives invoices, receiving reports and makes payments as
well as, obligates/de-obligates PI funds, makes payments to non-DoD agency for interagency
acquisitions and reimburses/pays the appropriate DoD agencies for intra-agency procurements.
2.7. Certifying Officials/Accounting Liaison Office (ALO). The ALO’s main purpose is to
certify the correct PI lines of accounting are used and funds are available. This function is
located in the Financial Analysis Office (FMA) within the base-level FM office. They also serve
as accounting liaison and budget representative to DFAS and update DFAS records with award
and financial data. ALOs advise requirement owners in determining bona fide need in terms of
purpose, time and amount, validate funds availability and accounting appropriation accuracy, and
review unobligated commitments and validate requirements. ALOs also ensure MIPRs contain
the required footnotes and business rules identified in AFI 65-116, AF Purchases Using Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Requests.
2.8. Unit Level Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). The PCO’s main purpose in the PI
process is to issue solicitations and award contracts to procure logistics requirements. They
ensure special or unique provisions meet applicable procurement laws and regulations or will
pursue the appropriate waivers and/or deviations and are the sole government point of contact
with the contractor/vendor. PCOs provide ROs business advice like devising acquisition
plans/strategy and building performance work statements; advise on acquiring organization fees
versus in-house procurement; and assist on documentation like sole source justification,
footnotes, market research, or Air Force terms and conditions. They validate MIPR packages are
complete, including required statements, business rules, interagency agreements and footnotes by
signing the MIPR checklist. They also actively participate on CBTs, CETs, CRTs and MFTs.
   2.8.1. The PCO is the only entity in the PI process authorized to direct the contractor to
   perform work, obligate funds and execute contracts. Within contracting activities,
   requirement owners may be dealing with a buyer, who performs most of the preliminary
   administrative contracting functions, or the PCO, who is the official contracting authority. In
   this publication, the term PCO encompasses both these contracting positions.
2.9. Primary Requirement Process Participants. Depending on the type of requirement
requested, a wide array of personnel and workcenters may have to contribute to completing the
PI package. The following lists some of the primary participants involved in the process.
   2.9.1. PI Requirement Owners (RO). These logisticians/acquisition professionals are
   responsible for day-to-day management of their assigned systems, programs and parts. ROs
   use computation systems, inputs from the field and MAJCOMs, situational awareness, and
   their experience to ensure weapon systems are sustained in the highest readiness state
   possible. ROs are the primary PI generators and responsible for the completeness and
   accuracy of the entire package to include item/service descriptions, identification of potential
   commercial sources, and recommending procurement strategies. They may delegate some
   data entry or initiation/completion of RO PI functions/activities to other personnel; however,
   the RO retains overall responsibility. ROs ensure all required coordination and PI
   components are obtained prior to funds certification and validate the package is complete
   prior to sending to the acquiring organization. According to the AFI 65-116 OPR, these
   individuals equate to that publication’s Program/Project Manager (PM). ROs primarily
   consist of:

      2.9.1.1. Item Manager (IM)/Materiel Manager (MM). The IM/MM manages the Air
      Force recoverable item worldwide inventory from cradle to grave to ensure the overall
      health of the supply chain. They calculate requirements, initiate procurement, and direct
      item distribution, reclamation and disposition actions; respond to customer inquiries; and
      record significant acquisition events on their items.
      2.9.1.2. Production Management Specialist (PMS) Seller. The PMS Seller executes
      asset repair requirements for contract actions if organic capability is exceeded or does not
      exist. They also execute the PI for non-organic requirements like system modifications,
      A&AS, Engineering support, aircraft PDM and Interservice requirements, etc. The PMS
      Seller coordinates with the IM, PM, ENs, and ESs among others to prepare PI supporting
      documentation to define the requirement to the Contract Support Service repair, quality,
      and testing requirements, and to qualify potential commercial sources of repair.
      2.9.1.3. Program Manager (PM)/Product Support Manager (PSM)/Logistics
      Manager (LM). PMs/PSMs/LMs, to different degrees, manage a system or an item over
      the course of its entire overall life-cycle, from development to acquisition, through
      sustainment to ultimate disposition. In supply chain functions, PMs develop acquisitions
      plans and sustainment strategies ROs follow. Also, they administer Air Force
      maintenance requirements and annual program system reviews, ensure Source of Repair
      Assignment Process (SORAP) requirements are satisfied; and prepare Requirement
      Approval Documents (RAD), CDRLs, and contractor performance specifications, among
      other supporting documents. In the AFLCMC, PMs primarily oversee the overall life
      cycle management of a weapons system; they also act as ROs and initiate or delegate PI
      actions.
   2.9.2. PI Contributors. As stated earlier, even though the RO is responsible for the PI
   package, they do not possess all the specialized expertise needed to complete all required
   elements. ROs should not overlook or underestimate the value of these experts to the
   procurement process. Significant delays or additional cost can occur if their expertise is not
   incorporated in the PI and passed to the PCO. PI contributors include Engineers, Screening
   Technicians, Resource Advisors/Managers, and Equipment, Packaging, Transportation,
   Security and Safety Specialists. Details on specific actions these personnel perform in the PI
   process may be expounded on in Center level guidelines.
      2.9.2.1. These contributors should be considered for inclusion on MFTs by the team
      lead.
2.10. Segregation of Duties: Certain functions must be segregated to prevent potential or
perceived conflict of interest or ethics violations from an audit or legal perspective.
   2.10.1. Individuals responsible for verifying or approving funding information should rarely
   perform RO functions unless there is a bona fide, documented, operational or manpower
   constraint within their organization. Under no circumstances should these personnel ever
   certify funds or be the final approval authority for a PI action prior to release for contracting
   action. PIs must have verifiable oversight from the PM or Logistics/Materiel Management
   Lead.
   2.10.2. The RO or PM must approve any quantity, funding, or delivery adjustment to a
   requirement other than those authorized on the basic or amended PI. Likewise, only the
 24                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   recognized engineering/technical authority should qualify commercial sources for spare part
   buys and repairs.
   2.10.3. No RO or other logistics or acquisition personnel should directly contact a vendor
   engaged in the bidding process or after contract award without coordination with, and
   approval by, the PCO or administrative contracting officer. Only contracting officers may
   obligate the government or engage in the contract award or post-award administration
   process. ROs must work vendor issues through the PCO.
   2.10.4. In order to establish clear segregation of duties on MIPRs, AFI 65-116 now requires
   the MIPR initiator, MIPR approver, and funds certifier be three separate people.
2.11. PR/MIPR Cell/Review Function. Each Center must establish a PR/MIPR Cell or
internal review function. Preferably a Cell/review function should be located at each major
operating location, complex, or PI generating organization, but this function may be consolidated
at one or more locations to facilitate the Center’s PIs review/approval process. If a “cell”
concept is not used, each Center must ensure, and be able to demonstrate, the PR/MIPR Cell
responsibilities assigned in this instruction are performed by an internal review function.
2.11.1. Centers may combine cells/review functions if multiple centers are co-located at an
installation to maximize resources and gain efficiencies. These working relationships must be
documented on a Memorandum of Agreement and will be subject to inspection to ensure the
base level operations are in compliance with the agreement and this instruction.
   2.11.2. The PR/MIPR Cell is responsible for:
       2.11.2.1. Reviewing PI packages for completeness and accuracy, including checklists,
       supporting documentation, and proper approval, prior to release to finance for funds
       certification and contracting for requests for proposals and contract award. Note: The
       RO retains the ultimate responsibility for PI content and processing flow.
       2.11.2.2. Assisting ROs in solving problems and clarifying situations arising during PI
       preparation and processing to ensure timely PI process flow.
       2.11.2.3. Being the initial point of submission for all incoming MIPRs at the Robins,
       Hill, and Tinker Air Logistics Complexes.
       2.11.2.4. Tracking incoming/outgoing MIPR status and location to ensure timely
       acceptance determinations, receipt of contract issuances and proper acquiring activity
       documents are received.
       2.11.2.5. Performing follow-up actions to ensure requiring agencies receive applicable
       acceptance and contract documents.
       2.11.2.6. Ensuring PI practices comply with Federal, DoD, AF, and AFMC regulations,
       procedures and policies.
       2.11.2.7. Ensuring PIs requiring “assets due-in from procurement” record tracking are
       properly entered in the Acquisition and Due-In System (ADIS) (J041) at the Robins, Hill,
       and Tinker ALCs. This can be accomplished by the PR/MIPR Cell or determined locally.
       Other activities must devise a tracking mechanism to manage PI flow and MIPR
       acceptances.

                                          Chapter 3

                                PI AND CONTRACT TYPES

3.1. PI and Contract Types. There are several options ROs must consider while determining
the optimal method of acquisition to clearly define weapon system requirements and develop the
selected PI type. Knowledge of PI and contract types is crucial to developing the appropriate
instrument and formulating the optimal acquisition strategy, including making contracting
method recommendations to the PCO.
3.2. Advance, Planning, Zero Dollar and Funded PIs. The MFTs or ROs initially determine
the type of PR to support the requirement. Funding availability and fiscal year are the primary
determinates and apply to all line items on the PR.
   3.2.1. Advance PI. An Advance PI is used to give contracting an advance notice of next
   fiscal year requirements. Advance PIs are unfunded, therefore do not require funds
   certification or need to flow to the ALO, but should include a written statement of funds
   availability in order to comply with AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5332.7, Contract
   Funding. The Advance PR flows to contracting as a preliminary (not funds certified)
   PI. Contracting may perform pre-award contract work on an Advance PR, but may not
   award until the actual Funded PR referencing the original PR number is received (unless
   otherwise authorized by law and in accordance with FAR32.702, Contract Funding Policy).
   Note: Refer to section 6.3.3.9 for changing/amending Advanced PRs.
       3.2.1.1. The RO must identify the PI as an Advance PI in the purpose field. Note: Do
       not use Advance PIs for FMS requirements.
   3.2.2. Planning PR. A Planning PR is used for current fiscal year requirements if funding is
   expected, but not yet available, or if the RO/PM does not want to commit funds
   immediately. Planning PRs are unfunded, therefore do not require funds certification or need
   to flow through the ALO, but should include a written statement of funds availability in order
   to comply with AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5332.7. The Planning PR flows to
   contracting as a preliminary (not funds certified) PR. Contracting may perform pre-award
   contract work on a Planning PR, but may not award until a Funded PR with committed funds
   using the same PR number is received (unless otherwise authorized by law and in accordance
   with FAR 32.702). Note: Refer to section 6.3.3.9 for changing/amending Planning PRs.
       3.2.2.1. The RO must identify the PR as a Planning PR in the purpose field.
       3.2.2.2. An “Advance” or “Planning” PR should be canceled as soon as possible after it
       is known that funding is not forthcoming, if the PR cannot be awarded by end of fiscal
       year, the requirement changes significantly, or the requirement no longer exists. A new
       PR with a different PR number may then be submitted if applicable. Also “committed
       funds” PRs should be processed as soon as possible after funds become available.
   3.2.3. Advance/Planning MIPR. An Advance or Planning MIPR is an unfunded MIPR
   provided to the acquiring organization in advance of the funded MIPR so that initial contract
   action planning can begin. Funding availability and fiscal year are the primary factor in
   determining which to use and Advance or Planning MIPRs cannot include funded line items.
   Prior to submitting an Advance/Planning MIPR, the requiring organization should confer
 26                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   with the acquiring organization to determine if it is advantageous. Each advance/planning
   MIPR should include a written statement of funds availability in order to comply with
   AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5332.7. Contracting may not award the contract until an
   actual “funded” MIPR is received. The requirement owner must annotate the appropriate
   statement identifying the MIPR as advance or planning in the MIPR purpose statement.
       3.2.3.1. Be advised when dealing with acquiring agencies, the DFARS PGI 208.7004-3
       uses the term “Advanced” to describe unfunded MIPRs used for planning purposes and
       requires a funded MIPR prior to award. It does not distinguish between “Planning” and
       “Advanced” MIPRs. The acquiring organization may associate the term “Advanced”
       with both situations. Note: Planning MIPRs will use the current Fiscal Year (FY) in the
       MIPR number. Advance MIPRs will use the applicable future FY in the MIPR number.
   3.2.4. Zero Dollar PR. A Zero Dollar PR is an unfunded PI used to establish or modify an
   Indefinite-Delivery Contract (type D) for use with task/delivery orders. The line item
   estimated unit and total price fields must reflect an amount of $0.00. The RO must enter an
   estimated total cost for the entire PR in the PR Remarks and the estimated line item unit and
   total prices in each line item Description/Remarks field. The Zero Dollar PR is not funds
   certified and does not flow through the ALO. It is received by contracting as an uncertified,
   but actionable PR. Contracting may process the Zero Dollar PR through to award without
   further action; however, any associated delivery/task order must obtain funds
   certification/commitment prior to award.
       3.2.4.1. When establishing a Zero Dollar PR to establish Definite Quantity or Indefinite
       Quantity type D contracts, the government’s actual obligation must be recorded at the
       time of contract award. Therefore, two PRs must be prepared; a Zero Dollar PR for the
       type D contract and a Funded committed PR for the initial associated delivery/task order
       for the guaranteed minimum quantity. The type D contract and the initial delivery/task
       order must be awarded simultaneously per AFFARS MP5316.504. This rule does not
       apply to a Requirements or Indefinite-Delivery Contract.
       3.2.4.2. The RO must identify the PR as a Zero Dollar PR in the purpose field. Note:
       MIPRs cannot be processed as a Zero Dollar request.
   3.2.5. Funded PR. A “funded” PR is a current fiscal year requirement with identified
   funding available for either “initiation” or “commitment”. The ALO can certify a Funded PR
   either to initiation stage of accounting to validate funds are available, but just reserved to
   allow preliminary negotiation of procurement actions, or to the committed stage of
   accounting when the funds are available and approved to spend. The Funded PR is then sent
   to contracting as a certified (not draft) PR. Contracting may award a contract from a
   “committed funds” Funded PR. Contracting may not award a contract from an “initiated
   funds” Funded PR. Contracting must receive another “committed funds” certified document
   using the same PR number, e.g. PR amendment, in order to award a contract.
3.3. Contract Options. A basic contract may include options to extend the contract’s period of
performance (PoP) and/or allow additional quantities of supplies to be ordered against a contract
when it is in the Government’s interest. The use of a basic contract with option periods provides
the government the same coverage period as a multi-year contract but without the long-term
obligation. ROs should be aware of contract terms and option exercise periods to make prudent
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                        27


recommendations to the PCO that can maximize the full benefit to the government. There are
two types of options, funded and unfunded.
   3.3.1. Funded Contract Award Options. Funded options invoke a delivery or performance
   requirement and obligate the government to pay for the goods or services. An Indefinite
   Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or subsequent option may obligate the
   government to procure specific item or services quantities, but not necessarily, so the RO
   must be familiar with IDIQ contract terms. The following practices ensure minimum
   quantities are purchased during the contract period and avoid government contract defaults:
       3.3.1.1. An IDIQ contract with minimum buy/repair quantities may not be awarded until
       the RO provides the supporting contracting office a funded PI for at least the minimum
       required quantity.
       3.3.1.2. If an option establishes a minimum buy obligation, the PI RO must provide the
       supporting contracting office a funded PI for that quantity prior to exercising any option
       period.
       3.3.1.3. Repair/service descriptions may be limited to the minimum information
       necessary to clearly identify the requirement.
       3.3.1.4. Cost data funded options elements will reflect the estimated obligated costs to
       exercise an option.
   3.3.2. Unfunded Contract Award Options. Unfunded options extend the contract’s Period
   of Performance (POP) that orders may be placed and/or allow additional quantities to be
   ordered against a contract.
       3.3.2.1. To exercise the option, a new funded PR or DOR must be initiated and each
       subsequent order must also be individually funded (refer to Delivery Order Request
       (DOR), Section 6.2.).
   3.3.3. Initiating PR Options (Funded or Unfunded). Each option has a defined time
   period that it may be exercised. If not exercised during that period, the option is lost. The
   RO forwards their recommendation to the PCO who ultimately makes the final decision.
   Before recommending the PCO exercise an option, the RO must: monitor available option
   status; validate the requirement; and assess prior contractor performance and other option
   factors to determine if exercising the option is in the Air Force’s best interest.
3.4. Contract Types. ROs should be familiar with various contract types in order to make
informed recommendations to the PCO. The objective is to obtain the required support with
minimal administrative effort and lead-time to shorten pipeline times and accelerate Warfighter
support. Refer to FAR Part 16, Types of Contracts for additional guidance.
   3.4.1. The specific contract types range from firm-fixed price (FFP) contracts that make the
   contractor fully responsible for performance costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-
   fixed-fee contracts that cover performance costs, provide a fixed fee, and limit contractor
   responsibility. Types include, but not limited to, FFPs, incentive contracts, cost-plus-award-
   fee contract, definite-quantity contract, time-and-material contracts, and agreements.
   3.4.2. FFP Contracts. A FFP contract sets the price; no adjustments are permitted based on
   the costs contractor incurs in contract performance. Contractors assume maximum risk and
   full responsibility for all excess costs impacting their profit or loss. FFP contracts maximize
28                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


  contractor incentive to control costs and perform effectively, and minimize administrative
  burden on the parties.
  3.4.3. Incentive Contracts. Incentive contracts compensate the contractor based on
  performance and results. They are appropriate when FFPs may limit competition or levy too
  much contractor risk. Incentive contracts can acquire required parts and services at lower
  costs and, in certain instances, improved delivery or technical performance because the
  contractor is motivated to excel. Incentive contracts can be combined with a fixed price
  contract (Fixed Price-Incentive Firm Target (FPIF)) to reward exceptional performance, or
  early delivery, or cover unexpected production costs, especially when an item is moving
  from development to production.
  3.4.4. Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Contracts. A cost-plus-award-fee contract reimburses
  operational cost, provides a fee fixed at contract inception, and an award amount the
  contractor may earn in whole or in part based on performance/results. These types of
  contracts provide contractor sufficient motivation to exceed quality, timeliness, technical
  ingenuity, and cost management expectations.
     3.4.4.1. Once a contract is let to satisfy a requirement, the associated PR line item is
     dead. If award fee provisions are used in that contract, another PR is required to fund the
     applicable contract line item. This is usually applicable to only repair/service
     requirements. The requirement owner must process an Award Fee/Contingency Liability
     PR to reserve the entire award fee early in the contract POP and hold pending an
     evaluation of vendor performance at the end of the POP. An award fee committee
     determines the appropriate award and either the Award Fee PR is released for the entire
     award or an amendment is processed for a lesser amount.
  3.4.5. Indefinite Delivery Contracts. An indefinite delivery contract is used to acquire
  supplies and/or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are
  not known at the time of contract award. There are three types of indefinite-delivery
  contracts: definite-quantity contracts, indefinite-quantity contracts, and requirements
  contracts. Indefinite-quantity contracts and requirements contracts are also known as delivery
  orders (DOR) or task order contracts.
     3.4.5.1. Definite-Quantity Contracts. A definite-quantity contract provides for
     delivery of a definite quantity of specific supplies or services for a fixed period, with
     deliveries or performance to be scheduled at designated locations upon order. A definite-
     quantity contract may be used when it can be determined in advance that a definite
     quantity of supplies or services will be required during the contract period; and the
     supplies or services are regularly available or will be available after a short lead time.
     3.4.5.2. Indefinite-Quantity Contracts. An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an
     unspecified quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period.
     The government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated
     as number of units or as dollar values. Indefinite-quantity contracts are used when the
     government cannot predetermine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of
     supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period, and it is
     inadvisable for the government to commit itself for more than a minimum quantity
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     29


     3.4.5.3. Requirements contracts. A requirements contract is unique in that it has no
     minimum quantity; instead, it obligates the government to purchase all quantities of the
     covered item(s) from the awarded source during the period covered. The risk of a
     requirements contract is it binds the government to that source for the entire contract
     term. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to request a requirements contract for items with
     a history of new source quality problems. Since basic requirements contracts may cover
     more than one year, it is advantageous to request a one-year basic contract with
     sequential option periods. The RO provides applicable requirements projections and
     desired minimum/maximum ordering information.
         3.4.5.3.1. On repair contracts with options, the CRT and/or RO will examine the
         requirement and determine the current competitive status (sole source or open
         competition) by reviewing the RMC/RMSC on the current CRSAW, and checking
         source development efforts prior to requesting an option be exercised. If the status
         has not changed, the option may be exercised without restriction.
         3.4.5.3.2. In these cases, the RO will provide the supporting documentation of the
         original Justification and Approval (J&A) for this repair to the PCO to include in the
         contract file. The MM/PMS will initiate a new PR, as needed, requesting a
         competitive repair solicitation early enough to ensure uninterrupted coverage upon
         completion of the option.
  3.4.6. Time-and-Material Contracts are used only when the extent or duration of the work
  or costs cannot be determined or estimated with any reasonable degree of confidence at the
  time the contract is awarded. Time-and-material contracts provide the contractor no positive
  incentive to control cost or manage labor efficiency. Therefore, thorough contractor
  performance surveillance is required to ensure efficient methods and effective cost controls
  are utilized. Labor hour contracts are variants of time-and-material contracts and letter
  contracts provide an option to accelerate production actions.
     3.4.6.1. Labor-Hour Contracts. A labor-hour contract is virtually the same as a time-
     and-material, the only difference is material is not contractor supplied.
     3.4.6.2. Letter Contracts. A letter contract (also referred to as an undefinitized contract
     action) is a written preliminary contractual instrument authorizing the contractor to
     immediately begin manufacturing supplies or performing services. It is used when there
     is insufficient time to negotiate a binding contract before the government’s need time,
     and in the government’s best interest to give the contractor a binding commitment to
     immediately start work. However, the letter contract must be as complete and definitive
     as possible under these circumstances. Refer to DFARS Subpart 217.74 for more detail.
  3.4.7. Multi-year contracts. Multi-year contracts are a contacting method that has POPs
  extending over several years. Types of multi-year contracts are listed in the FAR Part 17,
  Special Contracting Methods, and the DFARS Subpart 217, Multi-year Contracting. FAR
  Part 17 also covers basic contracts (one year) containing up to four more option years (under
  Options); AFMC refers to these as Multiple Year Contacts (MYC). AFMCMAN 23-1,
  Requirements for Secondary Items, establishes the conditions secondary items must meet to
  be considered for MYC. Whenever this publication generally refers to multi-year contract
  strategies, the term multi-year contract includes MYCs. More detail on multi-year contracts
  is in section 4.2.

  3.4.8. Effect of Multi-Year Contracting on ALT and PLT. Administrative Lead Time
  (ALT) (and in some cases Production Lead Time [PLT]) for orders placed against a multi-
  year contract may be substantially less than the ALT/PLT for single-buy contracts. If
  IM/MM or PCO does not account for this factor, the delivery may occur much earlier than
  needed, resulting in unexpected on-hand inventory increases. The following actions will
  prevent unwarranted inventory growth resulting from early multi-year contract deliveries:
     3.4.8.1. IM/MMs will use the reduced ALT/PLT in the consumable/recoverable
     requirements computation. No adjustment to order quantity or timing is needed, although
     the IM/MM must remember to initiate a PR for a new multi-year contract “full” lead time
     ahead of the current contract’s expiration to avoid a coverage break or stock out.
     3.4.8.2. The second year buy under the multi-year contract may be deferred into the third
     year. For these special cases, the IM/MM will show zero as the second year buy and
     explain in the RO’s remarks section. The IM/MM will indicate the expected ALT
     reduction/delay in the remarks so the PCO can advise the offerors.
     3.4.8.3. IM/MMs will maintain a historical file of ALTs and PLTs for all item
     procurements either by using electronic purchase request process system which tracks
     this information, or by completing AFMC Form 318, Item Contracting History Record.
     Refer to DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation,
     AFMCMAN 23-1 and AFMCMAN 23-4 (equipment items), for additional guidance.

4.1. Exhausting Existing Sources to Satisfy the Requirement. Before initiating a new PI buy
action the RO must exhaust all possible sources to obtain the item from existing government
stores, make the item organically, or tap into an existing government contract to procure the item
or service to maximize use of government owned assets or expenditure of working capital funds.
Each center must determine how these reviews are documented.
   4.1.1. Existing Inventories. The most preferred alternative is to make use of DoD owned
   materiel. AFMAN 23-110, United States Air Force Supply Manual, Volume III, Part I,
   Chapter 9 describes the Air Force Materiel Utilization and Disposition Program. In addition
   to other program aspects, that chapter details DoD screening policies and procedures for
   available assets to minimize new procurements. These include:
       4.1.1.1. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA is an excellent source for reclamation
       and surplus material. Reclamation is the process of reclaiming serviceable and
       economically repairable components from excess or disposal materiel to meet valid
       requirements. Surplus items can be an alternative to manufacturing new items and may
       be available to satisfy the requirement at substantial savings.
           4.1.1.1.1. It is DoD and USAF policy to reuse reclamation and surplus material in
           place of procurement or repair whenever it is more timely and economical to do so,
           when it is the most expedient means to satisfy a critical requirement, or when there is
           no other known source of supply, regardless of savings. The availability of suitable
           surplus materiel shall be determined prior to initiating new PIs. Procedures for
           identifying available reclaimed and surplus material are included in AFMAN 23-110,
           Volume 6. DLA can also be sourced through:
           4.1.1.1.2. DLA Disposition Services. This DLA agency ensures the fullest use of
           DoD assets, and precludes (1) concurrent item procurement and disposal actions, (2)
           repair actions when serviceable assets are available at other DoD Inventory Control
           Points (ICP), (3) unnecessary back hauling and cross hauling, and (4) incurring
           storage costs at multiple locations for surplus items. By screening disposal assets, the
           IM/MM can recover needed items and delay new procurements until the DoD
           inventory is totally exhausted. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Volume III, Part 1 for
           additional guidance.
               4.1.1.1.2.1. DLA can “push” IMs/MMs screening information for materiel
               passing through their DLA Disposition Services locations independently of the
               requirements systems buy notices. However, this service is limited to only certain
               categories of materiel (e.g., serviceable or reparable), there may be occasions
               when "pull" screening is necessary. For example, in an urgent buy situation the
               ROs may request screening of all assets (including condemned carcasses) if there
               is a possibility a normally unreparable carcass can be salvaged and made
               serviceable before a new buy can be delivered. The RO accomplishes this
               screening     through    the    DLA      Disposition     Services    Web      Site
               (http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/sitemap.shtml). The IM/MM accesses
32                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


             must prior to PR initiation, certifies and provides documentation DLA screening
             was accomplished and annotates the date checked and asset balance.
     4.1.1.2. Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System. This system
     identifies items left over at vendors' plants upon contract termination, completion,
     expiration, or change. The government previously paid for and owns these items and
     provides IMs/MMs a potential item source without generating a new PR action.
     4.1.1.3. Interservice Supply Support Program (ISSP). Check ICP on-hand balances
     of other services that are authorized users of an AFMC managed item. If their ICP
     balance exceeds the approved Air Force Acquisition Objective, the extra items may be
     redistributed to satisfy all or part of a current buy requirement.
         4.1.1.3.1. ISSP screening is a “pull "system IMs/MMs use to request other service
         ICP interrogations for recoverable and equipment items only. Upon receipt of an
         initial requirements computation showing a probable buy, the IM/MM will determine
         if other service ICPs have stock/store/issue authority (indicated by a Nonconsumable
         Item Materiel Support Code [NIMSC]) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, or 0).
         4.1.1.3.2. The IM/MM will contact the appropriate other service IMs/MMs to request
         ISSP screening of the required coded item and assigns a locally controlled "ISSP
         Document Number". If assets are available, the IM/MM will submit a
         MILSTRIP/MILSTRAP requisition citing the ISSP Document Number to satisfy as
         much of the requirement as possible. If the search is negative, or the requirement is
         only partially satisfied, the IM/MM will process a PR for the remaining required
         quantity.
     4.1.1.4. Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) Reclamation.
     AMARG reclamation is also an excellent source of supply and should also be considered
     in lieu of a new procurement. Specific programmed reclamation (save list) and priority
     reclamation processes are outlined in AFMCI 23-111, Reclamation of Air Force
     Property.
     4.1.1.5. Inventory Locator Service® (ILS). ILS is an online network of buyers and
     sellers of defense related parts, and aircraft and marine spares. This tool facilitates
     contact with supplier’s on-hand stock. Initiators can find surplus materiel using Web site
     (http://www.ilsmart.com).
  4.1.2. Local Manufacture. Utilizing organic fabrication capabilities is at times an
  economical alternative to buying the item commercially. The decision whether an item is
  suitable for "depot manufacture" (local, organic, in-house) is based on technical, economic,
  and support factors.
  4.1.3. Existing Contracts. If all possible sources for an item buy are exhausted, prior to
  initiating a PI for a repair or service, ROs must also check for existing contract vehicles in
  the Commodity Council Compliance Database and verify no other strategic or multi-year
  contract is available. The AFMC logistics community acquisition approaches include
  employing strategic or tactical approaches.
     4.1.3.1. Strategic Contracts. A contract is considered strategic if the contract is the
     outcome of a detailed data-driven process that results in a sourcing solution that
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      33


      addresses supply chain performance improvements and eLog21 goals. A strategic
      contract will provide coverage for multiple NSN requirements over three years or more,
      be centrally managed and will have the capability for decentralized ordering.
      4.1.3.2. Tactical Contracts. A contract is considered tactical if it does not meet the
      definition of a strategic contract. These contracts most often fulfill individual materiel
      requirements for goods and repair/services that are nonrecurring or when strategic
      contracts are not in place.
4.2. Multi-Year Contracting.
   4.2.1. Based on their experience, the RO or MFT may recommend an item as a good multi-
   year contracting candidate to the PCO. Multi-year contracting use should not conflict with
   open competition guidelines; however competition requirements do impose certain
   constraints on multi-year contracting use. The following rules apply:
      4.2.1.1. OTF&OC use justifications will be based on the highest possible total estimated
      maximum dollar value (the sum of the basic contract maximum quantity, options and
      maximum value of all future orders to be placed). Under OTF&OC procedures, the RO
      must absolutely justify maximum dollar thresholds if the resulting contract allows
      purchases up to a certain value.
      4.2.1.2. If at a certain future point more possible sources are expected that may change
      the item’s noncompetitive status, the multi-year contract’s term will not extend beyond
      that point and the requirement opened for a possible competitive sourcing. In these
      circumstances, the J&A must clearly support the contract term.
      4.2.1.3. If it is uncertain when a more competitive market is possible, the only acceptable
      multi-year contract is a MYC (one-year plus option years). The requirement owner or
      RO must review the current AMC/AMSC SAW and check market developments to verify
      current competitive status prior to exercising each option.
      4.2.1.4. If the status is unchanged, the option may be exercised only if the requirement
      cannot be deferred or a projected buy requirement exists and the need date does not
      provide sufficient time to use F&OC procedures. In these cases, the RO must provide the
      PCO written documentation supporting executing the original J&A for this buy, and the
      PCO must annotate the determinations in the contract file.
      4.2.1.5. The only quantity immediately needed or the option minimum buy quantity will
      be ordered against the indefinite quantity contract option. The RO will initiate a new
      F&OC PI as needed to ensure uninterrupted coverage as the OTF&OC contract options
      expire.
      4.2.1.6. When the multi-year contract is awarded competitively, all purchases, DORs or
      exercised options executed on the contract are also considered competitive.
      4.2.1.7. Orders placed against multi-year contracts may result in substantially lower
      ALT, and in some cases, PLT, than single-buy contracts. The RO and PCO must factor
      lower ALT/PLT when executing options or processing DORs to avoid possible on-hand
      inventory excess by taking the following actions:
          4.2.1.7.1. In special cases, the multi-year contract second year buy may be deferred
          to the third year. The RO will enter zero as the second year buy quantity and explain
34                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


         the circumstances and the expected ALT reduction/buy delay in the RO’s remarks
         field so the PCO can advise the offerors.
     4.2.1.8. The RO will submit recommendations to the PCO on an AFMC Form 338, MYC
     Request/Contract Info, if the circumstances indicate a multi-year contract may be
     optimal.
     4.2.1.9. The following items/buys are generally not considered multi-year contract
     candidates:
         4.2.1.9.1. Numeric Stockage Objective (NSO), minimum buy, and insurance buy PIs.
         4.2.1.9.2. FMS non-standard PIs and FMS direct cite/country-directed sole source
         requests for AMC 1 or 2 (competitive) items with no DoD users.
         4.2.1.9.3. Emergency/Urgent PIs.
         4.2.1.9.4. ND or NC number or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)
         CODE/part number PIs.
         4.2.1.9.5. Items containing materiel subject to rapid price fluctuations making long-
         term price forecasting difficult.
         4.2.1.9.6. Refer to center-level procedural guidance for Form 338 preparation
         instructions.
  4.2.2. Consider multi-year strategies for every procurement and apply whenever appropriate
  and possible. For additional information, refer to AFFARS IG 5317.1, Multi-year
  Contracting. Types of multi-year contracting methods include:
     4.2.2.1. Classic and Expanded Multiple Year Procurement (MYP). MYP contracts
     are primarily used for large weapon system acquisitions. These contracts must specify
     quantities, prices, and delivery schedules, and usually a substantial cancellation penalty
     applies if the government wants to cancel the buy. MYPs are generally appropriate only
     for major system buys managed by AFMC Product Centers.
     4.2.2.2. Indefinite-delivery (ID) contract with or without options. A requirement
     definite-quantity or an indefinite-quantity contract (IDIQ) may be established with
     contract term extension options. Alternatively, the basic contract can be set up with
     ordering periods covering several years. These types of contracts are preferred because
     once established, the deliveries may be requested as required using automated delivery
     order procedures.       Therefore, IDIQ contracts reduce administrative workload
     significantly during the contract’s life. It is essential that the RO accurately describe the
     nature of the item and requirement.
     4.2.2.3. MYC. MYCs are basic contracts with options spanning a total of up to 5 years
     and can be included with the above techniques if it is in the government’s interest.
     Unused options should be exercised if it is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the
     government’s need, price and other factors. Refer to the FAR Part 17 for more detailed
     guidance on options.
         4.2.2.3.1. MYC Coordination. The original request will be included with the PI
         package during coordination (included electronically in PRPS). After the contract is
         awarded, the original document is stored in the appropriate system repository.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      35


   4.2.3. The contracting community is the ultimate multi-year contract determination
   authority. The PCO decides if a multi-year contract (with or without an AFMC Form 338
   request) is the government’s best purchase option.
   4.2.4. Multi-Year Contract Changes. If out-year requirements forecast change prior to
   contract award, a new request must be prepared and forwarded to the PCO. Coordination is
   encouraged.
       4.2.4.1. PI Amendments are not required to add pseudo line items for various multi-year
       contracts
4.3. Quantity Discount Procedures (QDP). QDP contracts are firm-fixed-price for the fixed
quantity and apply for both consumable/recoverable item buys. If the system/item support
strategy indicates a QDP buy is conducive with AFMC inventory initiatives and sufficient
funding is available, the RO indicates the PR is a firm requirement and provides the QDP levels
used for price solicitation. Although not a multi-year contract, the quantity acquired is usually
more than one year's requirement therefore QDP is considered a form of MYC.
4.4. Variation in Quantity (VIQ) Provisions. The RO should advise the PCO of potential VIQ
up front so the best price can be negotiated and VIQ minimized. PCOs may not negotiate a VIQ
larger than specifically authorized by the RO. PCOs may insert a VIQ clause in fixed-price
supply solicitations/contracts authorizing VIQ acceptance. VIQs are not appropriate for
commercial-type items, especially those under continuous production. VIQs are appropriate if
the lack of a solicitation/contract VIQ increases costs because of contractor production
requirements. Some contractors will ask for a VIQ, even if not on the solicitation.
   4.4.1. If circumstances like an item’s loading, shipping, packing, or manufacturing processes
   could result in a quantity variation at delivery, the RO should include the statement "VIQ -
   xx%" in the PR remarks to the PCO. Normally, a variation of -5% is reasonable, although as
   much as -10% may be required based on prior experience on the requested or similar items.
   Positive variations up to +10% are also permissible when funds are available to pay for the
   additional items.
   4.4.2. Usually buy quantities greater than 1000 are assigned a -1% VIQ; quantities between
   501 and 1000, -3% are assigned; and for 100 to 500, -5%. The RO must state whether tighter
   or larger VIQs are acceptable in specific PR PCO instructions.
   4.4.3. If funds are readily available and the RO authorizes a positive variation, ROs must
   advise fund managers of the possible liability. Typically, contractors try to maximize
   revenue and ship as many units as the total authorized funding allows. Therefore, when
   funding is scarce, ROs should avoid positive variation use.
   4.4.4. Initiators should avoid applying absolute quantities to VIQ provisions because that
   will usually be the quantity the contractor sends.
4.5. Quantity Range. An RO can utilize quantity ranges if economic factors or quantity
fluctuations prior to contract award are likely to occur on an item buy. Quantity ranges differ
from VIQs because they are tied to vendor quantity price breaks and not production costs or
capability. By establishing quantity ranges (minimum and maximum) in line item remarks to the
PCO, the AF receives greater item procurement flexibility because the quantity can be changed
 36                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


when awarded without a PR amendment if the final buy quantity falls within the prescribed
range.
   4.5.1. The PI quantity should list the required quantity or best estimated quantity (BEQ).
   The ranges should be derived from reasonable production rates/price break quantities and not
   used to exceed a valid bona fide need. Unless the IM has better information, the minimum
   quantity can be set anywhere between 25% and 100% of the actual required quantity/BEQ
   and maximum quantity range set anywhere between 101% and 150%. Prior to award, the
   PCO must confirm the quantity does not exceed the range and verify the final quantity with
   the RO. Note: PRPS requires a medium quantity be set, this is the required quantity/BEQ
   and used to calculate the minimum and maximum ranges.
       4.5.1.1. For example, line item remarks to the PCO for a requirement of 100 could be as
       follows: “Request ranges: Minimum 25, Maximum 150; revalidation required.”
   4.5.2. If the PI requires a J&A, the J&A should list the maximum quantity range to avoid re-
   accomplishing the J&A if the PCO must order more than the required/medium quantity.
4.6. Life-of-Type (LOT) Buy. LOT buys are one-time procurements, when all cost-effective
and prudent alternatives have been exhausted, for the total future requirement of an item that is
no longer expected to be produced. The procurement quantity shall be based upon demand or
engineering estimates of mortality sufficient to support the applicable equipment until phased
out.
   4.6.1. LOT buys are a PR strategy to consider if replenishment buys may not be viable or
   practical. Refer to 4140.1-R, section AP1.1.69, Department of Defense Supply Chain
   Materiel Management Regulation and AFMCMAN 23-1, paragraph 1.11., for more details.
4.7. Minimum Buy Quantities. When there is a pressing need to buy an item and procurement
cost for the required quantity is less than $25,000, but vendor production or transportation cost
issues make it more economical to buy in excess of the requirement, the RO can authorize the
PCO to purchase more than the required quantity but not spend more than the approved amount.
If the total purchase price is more than the certified amount on the PR, an amendment is required
to put more money on that PR to affect the buy. The RO will include the remark: “If the quoted
prices are higher than estimated value, notify the RO to submit an amendment to adjust the
quantity.”
4.8. Buy to Dollar or Buy to Budget. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) can approve
quantities exceeding budgeted/estimated quantities IAW 10 USC 2308 to utilize total funds
available. The RO utilizes the maximum available funding to obtain the maximum quantity
possible. By establishing a requirement as Buy to Dollar/Buy to Budget the AF has greater
flexibility with the PI quantity value and can maximize funds designated for specific
requirements. However, this provision cannot be used to exceed the Bona Fide Needs Rule and
requires SECAF approval. The PI quantity will be the estimated quantity at the total funding
amount. The RO should list any quantity constraints, then indicate PI quantity is an estimate,
and include the statement “BUY TO BUDGET (OR DOLLAR)" in the remarks.
   4.8.1. At time of the contract award, the buy quantity can be changed/verified with IM
   approval without a PI amendment as long as funding is not exceeded and the quantity does
   not exceed the Bona Fide Needs Rule. Since this is a complex process, it is recommended a
   multi-functional team convene, including legal counsel, early in the process to ensure this
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                       37


   procurement strategy is appropriate and/or executable. Ensure this process starts earlier
   enough to obtain proper SECAF coordination.
4.9. Qualification Requirements (QR). Pre-Award qualification requirements are tests and
other quality assurance demonstrations that must be completed before contract awarded. The
pre-award qualification requirement objective is to ensure only known, proven sources are
considered for the contract award. Refer to FAR Part 9.2, Qualifications Requirements, for
detailed qualification requirements policy and procedures and AFMCI 23-113, Pre-Award
Qualifications of New or Additional Parts Sources and the Use of the Source Approval Request
(SAR) for additional guidance.
4.10. First Article (FA) Testing. First article requirements ensure the contractor can provide an
item that conforms to specified contract requirements. The RO must include a line item
requesting FA test report and citing specifications for each item requiring testing on the PI. The
engineer must obtain Data Management Officer (DMO) approval of the DID selection and
CDRL creation for the FA test reports, plans, or other test documents or data required as contract
deliverables. If the item(s) is (are) destroyed during contractor or government FA testing, an
additional line item is required for the FA quantity. Ensure disposition instructions are provided
for all FA requirements reflected on the AFMC Form 260, First Article Requirements.
4.11. AFMC New Source Insurance Policy. The purpose of allowing new sources to compete
for government contracts is to widen the competition base, keep established sources engaged and
energized, infuse innovation into the market, and keep prices competitive. However, this also
increases the risk of receiving a faulty item from an unproven source. To guard against this,
certain items (primarily complex or critical performance type items) require FA testing and
approval before the new source is given the production go-ahead. The AFMC New Source
Insurance Policy allows new sources to bid on such items while ensuring back-up contracts are
in place with a proven source for the minimum quantity needed to maintain support. This
procedure ensures complete support with no break in supply and prevents the government
waiting the entire AQLT if the new source’s FA fails. If the new source cannot perform, there is
an option in place that is only the PLT away from delivery.
   4.11.1. The insurance policy process applies to purchases if:
       4.11.1.1. A failure to deliver on schedule jeopardizes an operational unit’s mission
       capability.
       4.11.1.2. The item is assigned an AMC of 1 or 2 regardless of the AMSC.
       4.11.1.3. The complexity or criticality of the item requires FA testing to ensure the new
       source can produce a conforming part.
       4.11.1.4. The PI is processed under a routine PR/MIPR priority code E or R. Note:
       Priority A emergency PI need expedited processing and therefore are not candidates for
       the Insurance Policy. Insurance Policy criteria allows F&OC be applied for the Mission
       Essential Quantity (MEQ). If the urgency requires OTF&OC, the government must
       justify the circumstances and substantiate only one, or a limited number, of proven
       sources can satisfy the requirement.
 38                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   4.11.2. Requesting Use of the Insurance Policy. To request the Insurance Policy, the IM
   enters the MEQ as a separate line item and identifies the MEQ line item as an Insurance
   Policy buy in the remarks. The remarks to the PCO will state:
Figure 4.1. Remarks to PCO

 "Line Item __ is the Mission Essential Quantity needed to assure critical support while FA
 testing is accomplished. MEQ is based on completion of FA testing/verification within _____
 days of contract award. Critical mission requirements prohibit any slippage without prior IM
 approval. Failure to satisfy delivery and testing requirements on schedule will result in the
 proven source option being immediately exercised."

       4.11.2.1. The RO will reflect the referenced delivery schedule on an AFMC Form 260.
       Further FA item marking instructions (Ship to/Mark for) must require the contractor to
       clearly identify the delivery as an Insurance Policy item and expedite for FA testing after
       receipt.
       4.11.2.2. If the dollar value exceeds the SAT, a J&A also must be submitted with the
       Insurance Policy PR in case an unproven source is the lowest offeror. This situation
       requires the J&A cover two actions (one definite and one potential). The first action
       (definite) will award the MEQ to the new proven source referring to FAR Part 6. This
       action always applies for an insurance buy when an unproven source is the lowest
       offeror. The second action (potential) is exercised if (and only if) the unproven source
       fails to meet the FA contract requirements and a contract is awarded to a proven source
       for the requirement balance, IAW FAR Part 6.3., Other Than Full and Open Competition.
4.12. Direct Shipment. DoD policy emphasizes direct vendor-to-customer deliveries whenever
it is economical. ROs should request direct shipments to field customers to shorten the AQLT
and eliminate secondary transportation costs whenever possible.
   4.12.1. RO will not specify direct shipments unless the field backorder is still valid when the
   vendor is ready to deliver. AFMC Form 270, Request for Issuance of Shipping Instructions
   Amended Shipping Instructions (ASI) should be processed for open backorders before
   scheduled delivery to improve mission support and reduce transportation costs. Refer to
   center-level procedural guidance for form 270 preparation instructions.
   4.12.2. In order to qualify for air shipment, the RO must provide all available Military
   Standard Requisition and Issue Procedure (MILSTRIP)/Military Standard Transaction
   Reporting and Accounting Procedure (MILSTRAP) information on the PI or ASI.
   4.12.3. Depot computation systems are programmed to direct shipment assets to the highest
   priority location. Occasionally sustainment/supply chain IMs/PMSs must take external
   actions to optimize asset management and direct asset movements to locations contrary to
   where the computations would send them. In these cases IMs/PMSs must suppress the
   system generated direct shipments and send the asset to the location list in the PI
   transportation instructions.
4.13. Consolidating Requirements. The administrative costs of PR/MIPR processing make it
uneconomical to prepare numerous low-dollar purchase instruments.          Consolidating
buy/repair/services requirements onto a single PR/MIPR reduces administrative costs and
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                        39


increases quantity price breaks saving. If appropriate, multi-year contracting techniques are
recommended. Note: Because of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision to
transfer Depot Level Reparable (DLR) item procurement responsibility to DLA, all PRs for
ERRC “T”, Budget Code 8 items must be procured through DLA. Non-DLA PRs may request
any ERRC combination except “T”.
   4.13.1. However, in order to facilitate PI processing in RO and PCO workflows,
   requirements must have some data elements in common in order to consolidate on a single
   PR. Table 4.1 lists those common elements; however, Centers may have additional
   requirements.

Table 4.1. Common Data Elements for PI Consolidation
                  Common Data Elements for PI Consolidation
  Acquisition Method Code/Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMC/AMSC)
  Cage Code
  Federal Stock Code or Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC)
  Priority (Emergency, Urgent, Routine)
  Procuring Agency ( PI RO DoDAAC)

4.14. Surge Requirements. Surge requirements are used to respond to real world contingency
events by accelerating PI processing and allowing contract provisions to expedite items and
services.    Surge requirements differ from urgent or emergency requirements in that,
urgent/emergency PIs satisfy specific, finite, point-in-time needs. Surges on the other hand
entail a larger scope, scale, and duration to react to a temporary but extended high operations
tempo situation.
   4.14.1. Government agencies and contractors may use any authorized means possible to
   expedite the delivery process to improve turnaround time to meet Surge/MICAP
   requirements.
   4.14.2. Serviceable assets will be shipped by “Fast Transportation”.
   4.14.3. The RO and/or System Program Manager must advise the Contracting Office to
   ensure surge contract provisions call for a vendor response sufficient to meet the elevated
   urgency of need driven by the event.
   4.14.4. Indicate the PI requires surge processing in the PI purpose statement.
   4.14.5. Surge requirements are not authorized for priority “E” and “R” PIs.
4.15. Standard Support Equipment (SE) Identified during Provisioning. The acquisition
process for new systems requires a SE review. The contractor provides a Support Equipment
Recommendation Document (SERD) to the System Acquisition Manager (e.g., the Product
Center System Program Office (SPO)) and passes it to the involved AFSC/AFLCMC unit for
review. This review identifies standard SE (i.e., SE that is already catalogued and assigned for
AFMC management), and must include the following actions:
   4.15.1. The assigned SE IM will review current USAF and other DoD asset balances. If the
   requirement can be totally or partially satisfied from available assets, the IM/MM will initiate
   the necessary supply redistribution actions.
 40                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


   4.15.2. If the total requirement cannot be satisfied from available DoD assets, the IM/MM
   will review current buy/contract actions. If possible, the IM/MM will take the appropriate
   action to get the required quantity ordered or amend PI actions in work to add the additional
   requirements.
   4.15.3. If the alternatives above will not satisfy the total requirement, the SPO determines
   the most appropriate method of procurement either by adding the SE requirement to the
   production contract or by sending the IM/MM a funded PR/MIPR or Fund Cite
   Authorization (AF Form 616) for direct cite action.
   4.15.4. The IM/MM will list the actions taken in the provisioning documentation and item
   files.
   4.15.5. For all actions, the need date specified on the provisioning documents will be the
   basis of the requisition/contracting priority. However, the IM/MM and SPO should remain
   in close communication with each other and take prompt action should the need date change.
4.16. Requirements in Support of Modifications/Time Compliance Technical Order
(TCTO) Programs. If the government is contracting for engineering and developmental
modification/TCTO programs, the spare parts and hardware will be a line item on the PI for
those services. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part 1, Chapter 11 for more detail.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      41

            MILITARY INTERDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASE REQUESTS

5.1. Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). MIPRs are documents used by
the DoD to order goods or services from other DoD Agencies or Components, as well as
government activities outside the DoD. The goods or services may be provided from in-house
resources or may be procured from commercial sources. There are processes set for the AFMC
logistics operations to both accept (incoming) and request (outgoing) MIPRs for spares, repairs,
and services from other government agencies. Incoming and outgoing MIPRs are explained in
more detail later in this chapter. This section covers information and general policy common to
both.
   5.1.1. MIPR Categories. MIPRS are categorized by the method of funding.
       5.1.1.1. Reimbursable Order (Category I): The acquiring organization obligates its
       own funds to initially procure the supply, service or repair. DFAS reimburses the
       assisting/acquiring organization using the requiring organization’s fund cite. The MIPR
       number and Standard Document Number (SDN) are the source document numbers
       throughout the life of the acquisition and must be cited on all obligating documents.
       Note: The MIPR number and SDN could be the same number on incoming MIPRs.
       5.1.1.2. Direct Citation Order (Category II): The requiring organization provides
       funding to be applied directly to the purchase of the applicable line items. The acquiring
       organization includes the MIPR fund cite on the contract and DFAS pays the performing
       contractors directly from the requiring organization’s fund cite. The MIPR number and
       SDN number, along with the contract number, must be cited on all obligating documents
       and correspondence.
       5.1.1.3. Both categories can be used on a single MIPR. Generally the acquiring
       organization and RO negotiate which category applies to an order. Refer to AFI 65-116
       for additional guidance. Note: If the Nonconsumable Item Material Support Code
       (NIMSC) is 1,2,3,4 or 8, the Secondary Inventory Control Agency (SICA) must submit
       supply support requirements to the Primary Inventory Control Agency (PICA) on a MIPR
       unless otherwise directed by the PICA. NIMSCs identify the degree of support received
       by an individual SICA, identify the Service(s) performing depot maintenance, or a Lead
       Service PICA. Refer to DoD 4100.39-M, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS)
       Procedures Manual Multiple Application References/Instructions/Tables and Grids,
       Volume 10, for additional guidance.
   5.1.2. Forms Used.
       5.1.2.1. DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request, is used by
       government requiring agencies to request items or services from another government
       agency with the exception of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
       (NASA). IAW DFARS 208.71, Acquisition for National Aeronautics and Space
       Administration (NASA), NASA will use an NASA Form 523, NASA-Defense Purchase
       Request.
42                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


     5.1.2.2. DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR. DD Form 448-2 is used by the
     acquiring organization to document concurrence/rejection and terms of MIPR acceptance.
     Rationale for a denial or other instructions to satisfy the request (i.e., item in stock,
     submit a MILSTRIP requisition) should be explained on the DD 448-2 form.
         5.1.2.2.1. The DD Form 448-2 must be completed by the acquiring organization and
         returned to the requesting organization within 30 days of receipt IAW DFARS PGI
         208.7004-2, Acceptance by acquiring department.
  5.1.3. Each Center must develop both Incoming and Outgoing MIPR Checklists to ensure
  MIPR packages have the required contents and are coordinated on by the applicable support
  functions. Base level variants are permissible to accommodate local requirements but must
  be reviewed and approved by the applicable Center in writing. It may be combined with the
  checklist in AFI 65-116 as long as all the AFI checklist items are included. If advantageous,
  AFSC, AFLCMC and AFNWC may develop joint checklists for MIPR processing at Robins,
  Tinker, and Hill ALCs.
  5.1.4. Each Center will develop a means to track Incoming/Outgoing MIPR status to ensure
  timely acceptance actions, initiate timely follow-ups, and monitor progress through award or
  cancellation for each operating location.
  5.1.5. The acquiring organization may not alter or modify an incoming MIPR without the
  full coordination and approval of the requiring organization via an amendment.
  5.1.6. The following terms apply to MIPR processes:
     5.1.6.1. Accepting Officer. Refers to the individual performing the acquiring
     organization functions in the incoming MIPR process. They review, verify and approve
     or reject other agency funds obligations for the unit with budget authority.
  5.1.6.2.   Acquiring Organization. Refers to the unit/agency receiving the complete
  certified incoming MIPR packages from requiring organization, determines MIPR
  acceptance or rejection and returns completed DD Form 448-2 to requiring organization
  within 30 days IAW DFARS PGI 208.7004-2. Also referred to as an accepting, assisting, or
  servicing organization in various DoD and Air Force documents.
     5.1.6.3. Intra-agency Support. Refers to requirements obtained from an agency within
     DoD. Example: An Air Force unit forwards a MIPR to the Army to order
     supplies/services for the Air Force. The Army is the intra-agency acquiring agency.
  5.1.6.4. Interagency Support. Refers to requirements obtained from an agency outside
  DoD. Example: An Air Force unit forwards a MIPR to GSA to order supplies/services for
  the Air Force. GSA is the acquiring interagency. Refer to AFI 65-116 for additional
  guidance.
     5.1.6.5. Requiring Organization. Refers to the unit/organization requesting goods or
     services from an acquiring organization and provides requirement funding. The requiring
     organization is also referred to as the receiving or requesting organization.
  5.1.7. Cutoff Dates. The cutoff date for submitting MIPRs citing expiring appropriations is
  prescribed in DoD DFARS PGI Part 208.7004-4 and in implementing procedures and
  agreements with other services and agencies under coordinated procurement programs.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      43


  5.1.7.1. MIPRs received in the PR/MIPR Cell/review function after the cutoff date must be
  boldly marked “Funds Expire” (with the expiration date) on the face of the MIPR. The
  MIPR will be accepted provided each request either conforms to a prior agreement between
  the requiring and contracting activity or cites some unforeseen circumstances or other
  controlling factor, which precluded submission before the cutoff date. If circumstances
  require the MIPR to be submitted after the established cutoff date, the requiring activity or
  the MIPR RO must contact the contracting activity to make sure they will accept the late
  MIPR and ascertain whether or not the contracting activity will be able to execute a contract
  by the end of the fiscal year.
  5.1.7.2. Air Force funds expiring in a given FY must be awarded to a contract or task order
  within 90 days of MIPR acceptance or by 30 September of the applicable FY, whichever
  occurs first. If a contract or task order is not awarded by 20 September, the requiring
  organization should reevaluate their requirements and de-obligate funding to allow funds to
  be used prior to expiration. In this case, a MIPR amendment must be expeditiously
  processed to ensure timely MIPR cancellation. For goods, delivery may occur after the funds
  expiration date. Refer to DFARS PGI 208.7004-5, Notification of Inability to Obligate on
  Category II MIPRs.
  5.1.8. MIPR Requirement Cancellation/Termination. The requiring organization initially
  notifies the acquiring organization if a partial or total MIPR cancellation/termination is
  necessary and then must follow-up with an amendment. Refer to DFARS PGI 208.7004-6,
  Cancellation of Requirements for further guidance.
     5.1.8.1. Category I (Reimbursable) MIPRs. The requiring organization must promptly
     notify the acquiring organization by electronic or other immediate means before
     cancelling all or part of a MIPR request. The requiring organization must initiate an
     amendment within 2 workdays to follow-up that communication. The acquiring
     organization will notify the requiring organization of the remaining un-obligated
     quantities and funds within 30 days. Upon receipt of this information, the requiring
     organization will issue another MIPR amendment to reduce the quantities and funds
     accordingly.
     5.1.8.2. Category II (Direct Citation) MIPRs. The requiring organization will notify the
     acquiring organization of their need to cancel all or part of the supplies, services or
     repairs requested in the MIPR.
         5.1.8.2.1. If the acquiring organization has not awarded a contract for the MIPR
         request, the acquiring organization will immediately notify the requiring organization
         and return the unused funds on the DD Form 448-2.
     5.1.8.3. If the items have already been placed under contract:
  5.1.8.3.1. As soon as practicable, but not more than 45 days after cancellation notice receipt,
  the PCO shall issue a termination data letter to the requiring organization.Refer to DFARS
  PGI 208.7004-6 for examples.
         5.1.8.3.2. The Termination Contracting Officer (TCO) shall review the proceedings
         at least every 60 days to reassess the government’s probable obligation. If there are
         funds above the probable settlement requirement, or if it appears remaining funds are
         not sufficient for the probable settlement, the TCO will promptly direct the
 44                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


          contracting office to send an amended termination data letter to the requiring
          organization.
          5.1.8.3.3. If the requiring organization owes the acquiring organization; they will
          process a MIPR amendment to reinstate the appropriate amount within 30 days after
          receiving the amended termination data letter.
   5.1.8.3.4. If the termination settlement agreement determines surplus funds remain, the
   requiring organization will prepare a MIPR amendment to recoup remaining excess funds.
          5.1.8.3.5. When the acquiring organization terminates/defaults on a contract, it will
          ask the requiring organization if the supplies or services on the contract are still
          required; if so, a re-purchase action will be initiated. Refer to DFARS PGI 208.7004-
          7.
       5.1.8.4. MIPR Control, in coordination with the contracting organization, processes the
       cancellation on incoming MIPRs.
5.2. Incoming MIPRs. The PR/MIPR Cell will act as the base focal point for all incoming
MIPRs at Hill, Tinker and Robins AFBs (usually located in the AFSC). The Cell distributes the
MIPR to the applicable accepting organization who administers the package IAW Center
procedures. The incoming MIPR process should be defined in center-level implementing
guidance for other locations. Incoming MIPRs are defined as requirements received from other
governmental agencies via DD Form 448 or NASA Form 523. All incoming MIPR information
in this guidance is in accordance with FAR Part 8, Required Sources of Supplies and Services;
FAR Part 17, Special Contracting Methods; DFARS Part 208, Required Sources of Supplies and
Services; DFARS Part 253, Prescription of Forms; and DFARS PGI Part 208, Required Sources
of Supplies and Services and AFI 65-116.
   5.2.1. AFMC logistics and acquisition organizations receive MIPR requests from other
   governmental agencies to procure items or services the Air Force is designated as the PICA
   or as a result of an interdepartmental agreement. In these cases the AFMC unit is referred to
   as the acquiring organization and the customer is the requiring organization. Note: If the
   Non-consumable Item Material Support Code (NIMSC) is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8, the requiring
   organization or SICA must submit supply support requirements to the PICA on a MIPR
   unless otherwise directed by the PICA. Refer to DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, for additional
   guidance.
       5.2.1.1. The acquiring organization may not alter or modify an incoming MIPR without
       the full coordination and approval of the requiring organization via an amendment.
   5.2.2. Other Agency Guidance. MIPR procedures are not absolutely standard across all
   agencies. Other services and government agencies may have internal MIPR requirements
   that may not comply with Air Force guidance. However, the Air Force cannot reject
   incoming MIPRs as long as they comply with DoD directives, FAR, DFARS, implementing
   procedures, or joint agreements.
       5.2.2.1. Non-DoD governmental agencies prepare MIPRs IAW FAR Part 8.
   5.2.3. Incoming MIPR Requirements. The requiring government agency shall submit a
   certified, complete MIPR package to the acquiring organization on the DD Form 448, MIPR
   as prescribed in DFARS 208.7005, Military interdepartmental purchase requests or NASA
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                    45


  Form 523. Electronic package submission is permitted but the package must include all
  necessary supporting documents IAW DoD FMR, Volume 11a, Reimbursable Operations,
  Policy and Procedures, Chapters 2, 3 and 18.
     5.2.3.1. All items requested on an incoming MIPR should be limited to one Federal
     Supply Classification (FSC). Refer to SB 708-21, Federal Supply Classification for
     group and class structure information.
     5.2.3.2. Specifications and Drawings. The requiring department need not furnish
     Federal, military, departmental, or other specifications or drawings or data that are
     already available to the acquiring organization. When requiring organization submits
     reproducible masters or copies of drawings and/or specifications cited on the MIPR
     attachment, the acquiring organization cannot deviate from, or make exceptions to, MIPR
     documents without the requiring organization’s express written authority.
         5.2.3.2.1. If the acquiring organization contracting office needs to prepare multiple
         bid sets, the requiring organization must provide a reproducible statement authorizing
         “reproduction for procurement purposes” for the attached manufacturer’s
         specifications or drawings. Incoming MIPRs that do not indicate a supplier and AMC
         will be screened and the appropriate AMC/AMSC or RMC/RMSC assigned.
     5.2.3.3. Incoming MIPRs received without all the specification data in reproducible form
     listed on the attachment should be considered incomplete.
     5.2.3.4. Each incoming MIPR must only request support from a single AFMC
     organization; requirements for items or services from multiple AFMC agencies require a
     separate MIPR for each requirement.
  5.2.4. Incomplete MIPRs. The acquiring organization will reject incoming MIPRs with
  incomplete or erroneous information (missing signature, fund citation, packaging data,
  transportation data, etc.). The acquiring organization will forward a DD Form 448-2 citing
  the rejection reason to the requiring organization or they may just request the missing items
  from the requiring organization.
  5.2.5. PR/MIPR Cell/review function will:
     5.2.5.1. Be the focal point for all incoming MIPRs and track/monitor MIPR status.
     5.2.5.2. Utilize the Incoming MIPR Checklist to ensure MIPRs contain the requisite data.
     5.2.5.3. Identify the appropriate function for the request, attach a DD 448-2, Acceptance
     of MIPR to the MIPR package and checklist, and then forward the MIPR package to the
     appropriate organization for acceptance or rejection. Refer to DFARS PGI 253.208-2,
     DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR for guidance on completing the DD Form 448-2.
     5.2.5.4. Ensure the DD Form 448-2 is returned to the requiring organization no later than
     30 days from MIPR receipt.
     5.2.5.5. Ensure all incoming MIPR documents reflect the incoming MIPR and/or
     amendment number. This includes contractual documents, correspondence, etc.
     5.2.5.6. Send complete CAT II MIPR packages to contracting.                Send CAT I
     Reimbursable MIPRs to DFAS via local FM office.
46                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


  5.2.6. AFMC Acquiring Organization will:
     5.2.6.1. If the MIPR requests NSN support, forward the MIPR to the requirements owner
     to determine method of acquisition, (i.e. satisfy from on-hand stock, procure using an
     existing contract, procure on new PI, or if service can be performed).
     5.2.6.2. If the MIPR requests a Non-NSN support, forward the MIPR, suspense letter,
     prepared DD Form 448-2 (blocks 1-5) and completion instructions to the program
     manager.
     5.2.6.3. Accept the MIPR as Category I, if acquiring organization performs the
     service/action organically.
     5.2.6.4. Accept the MIPR as Category II, if AF contracting action must procure the item
     or service.
     5.2.6.5. Reject the MIPR if items can be furnished from stock (within DoD). Instruct the
     requesting organization to submit a funded MILSTRIP requisition through the supply
     system.
         5.2.6.5.1. Annotate the rejection block on the DD Form 448-2 with an explanation
         and recommend alternative method of acquiring support if applicable.
     5.2.6.6. Return MIPR, MIPR Acceptance and required attachments to MIPR Control for
     distribution.
  5.2.7. MIPR Acceptance Preparation. The DD Form 448-2 is initiated by the PR/MIPR
  Cell or review function and sent to the designated MIPR acceptance/rejection decision
  approval official. The DD Form 448-2 is then returned to the PR/MIPR Cell who will send
  completed acceptance back to the requiring organization. Rationale for the denial or other
  instructions to satisfy the request (i.e. item in stock, submit a MILSTRIP requisition) should
  be explained on the DD 448-2. DFAR PGI 208.70 prescribes the DD Form 448-2 use and
  DFARS PGI 253.208-2 provides instructions. In addition to those instructions, fill out the
  Accepting Organization Address, Authorized Official (Accepting Official), signature (may
  be electronic) and date fields.
     5.2.7.1. If the MIPR is accepted, indicate the MIPR line item numbers that will be
     provided under each method of financing. If quantities or estimated costs cited in a
     MIPR require adjustment, list the affected MIPR line item number together with the
     adjusted quantities or estimated costs.
     5.2.7.2. When funds of two or more appropriations are involved, provide proper
     breakdown information in the Remarks block.
     5.2.7.3. Category I MIPRs must indicate the fund cite the acquiring organization wants
     reimbursed, including the sales code, in the remarks block. This creates an unfilled
     customer order to ensure the reimbursement process occurs. DFAS cannot process
     reimbursements without this information.
  5.2.8. Notification of Excess Funds Available for Withdrawal. As soon as all the
  incoming MIPR requirements are placed on a contract, the acquiring organization notifies the
  requiring organization of the excess funding on a revised DD Form 448-2 or copy of the
  contract. The acquiring organization must furnish this information as soon as obligation
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                  47


   action is completed to allow the requiring organization to immediately reallocate excess
   funds to other procurements.
   5.2.9. Additional Funding. When additional funds are required to complete the contracting
   action, the acquiring organization must request additional funds from the requiring
   organization by submitting a revised DD Form 448-2. The request must identify the exact
   items involved and reason for the additional funds. The requiring organization must submit
   an amendment to provide the additional funds or reduce the requirement.
   5.2.10. Incoming MIPR Amendments. Acquiring agencies may not deviate from or
   modify MIPR data without the requiring organization approval. Changes must be requested
   via DD Form 448-2 and responded to via amendments from the requiring organization. Such
   instances may include, but are not limited to, the following:
       5.2.10.1. Requested delivery schedule changes.
       5.2.10.2. Funding increases/decreases.
       5.2.10.3. Line of Accounting changes.
       5.2.10.4. Acquiring organization line items rejections – requiring organization non-
       accepted line items removals.
       5.2.10.5. Changes to specifications, terms, conditions, POP, etc.
       5.2.10.6. MIPR amendments are coordinated with packaging and transportation if
       applicable. Note: Amendments cannot change the basic MIPR scope (e.g., adding a
       stock number that was not on the basic MIPR).
   5.2.11. Incoming MIPR Document Maintenance.
       5.2.11.1. MIPR Case Files will contain the following:
          5.2.11.1.1. Original signed MIPR with all supporting documentation.
          5.2.11.1.2. All original signed MIPR amendments.
          5.2.11.1.3. Acceptance of DD Form 448-2 for basic and all amendments.

       5.2.11.1.5. Pertinent correspondence.
       5.2.11.2. Incoming MIPR files shall be maintained in accordance with the AF Records
       Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
       Note: PRPS will serve as a permanent electronic repository for all MIPRs done
       electronically in that system. The PR/MIPR Cell maintains the file at Hill, Tinker and
       Robins AFBs.
5.3. Outgoing MIPRs. This section provides guidance for requests for sustainment and
acquisition support from other services or government agencies using the MIPR, DD Form 448.
All MIPR changes and deviations occurring after fund certification require a MIPR amendment.
All information contained in the MIPR chapters is in accordance with DoD FMR 7000.14.R Vol.

217, Special Contracting Methods; AFFARS Part 5307, Acquisition Planning; AFFARS Part
5308, Required Sources of Supplies and Services; and AFI 65-116.
   5.3.1. Outgoing MIPRs Restrictions. MIPRs may not be used for the following purposes;
   the list is not all inclusive, other exceptions may be possible:
      5.3.1.1. Supplies obtained by local purchased base contracting procedures.
      5.3.1.2. Air Force materiel held in another agency’s storage.
      5.3.1.3. Excess property.
      5.3.1.4. Items stored in the PICAs on-hand stock.
   5.3.2. Outgoing MIPR Process. During acquisition planning the overall procurement
   strategy is developed. Prior to requesting acquiring organization support, the Air Force
   requiring organization must determine an assisted (intergovernmental) acquisition is needed
   and in the best interest of the government (e.g., expertise or acquisition resources are not
   readily available within the requiring organization but an acquiring organization is capable of
   satisfying the requirement).
      5.3.2.1. Before initiating a MIPR the RO must:
          5.3.2.1.1. Ensure requirement is valid and consult with Financial Management (FM)
          and the RA/RM to determine bona fide need in terms of purpose, time and amount
          and confirm funding availability. This could be accomplished through an MFT.
          5.3.2.1.2. Conduct market research to determine potential sources.
          5.3.2.1.3. If that source is another government agency, contact acquiring organization
          by the fastest means possible to determine if they can provide part or all of the
          required items or services or whether they must be procured through the acquiring
          organization commercially.
              5.3.2.1.3.1. Submit a funded MILSTRIP requisition IAW AFMC 23-110 for
              required items quantities the acquiring organization can provide from stock;
              outgoing MIPR actions are not required for those quantities.
              5.3.2.1.3.2. If not in stock then exhaust all the possible sources cited in section
              4.1.
      5.3.2.2. If procurement action for any remaining quantity is still necessary, then continue
      with the outgoing MIPR submission. The MIPR RO will:
          5.3.2.2.1. Ensure both the checklist in AFI 65-116 and the Center Outgoing MIPR
          Checklists are complete before MIPR is routed for review and fund certification. The
          AFI 65-116 checklist contains mandatory coordination and other information the
          PCO needs and is part of the MIPR package. The Center checklist is an internal
          quality control measure to ensure all required MIPR components are included in the
          package, including the 65-116 checklist, and not submitted to the PCO.
          5.3.2.2.2. Determine MIPR Categories of Acceptance.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                   49


         5.3.2.2.3. For service contracts, obtain Services Designated Official (SDO) approval.
         Refer to FAR Part 37, Subpart.6, Service Contracting - Performance-Based
         Acquisitions and DFARS 237.5, Service Contracts. On service contract requirements
         ensure the PWS is written in performance based terms and is approved by the SDO.
         Refer to AFI 65-116 and AFI 63-101 for detailed instructions.
             5.3.2.2.3.1. Ensure services above $2,500 address quality assurance requirements
             to ensure the services rendered meet contract requirements. Develop a plan to
             assess contractor performance. Refer to FAR Part 46.102 (a)-(g), Quality
             Assurance- Policy and DFARS 46.202, Types of Contract Quality Requirement,
             for additional guidance.
             5.3.2.2.3.2. State whether the requirement is severable or non-severable. A
             requirement is severable if it is continuing and recurring in nature and provides
             the requiring organization benefit each time the service is performed throughout
             the contract POP. A requirement is non-severable if the benefit comes or is
             delivered at the end of the contract period. Refer to AFI 65-116 for additional
             MIPR package requirements.
         5.3.2.2.4. Coordinate with the unit RA/RM and ALO to ensure funds are available
         and accounting appropriation is correct.
         5.3.2.2.5. A PCO review is required to obtain business advice and procurement
         support to ensure an appropriate approach is requested before the MIPR can be
         released to the acquiring organization. The review must be documented on the MIPR
         checklist. Refer to AFI 65-116 for specific PCO actions.
  5.3.3. Special Instructions.
     5.3.3.1. Attendance of Air Force Personnel at Inspection, Tests, and Provisioning
     Meetings. The requiring organization MIPR must specify Air Force attendance is
     required or desired to observe First Article (FA) item inspection/testing on production
     contracts or if the Air Force requires pre-provisioning, guidance, provisioning, and/or
     source coding meetings. However, if other service or Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
     Statement of Provisioning Policy is used, a Provisioning Requirement Statement contract
     is prepared and included with the MIPR.
     5.3.3.2. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). FMS customers may specify particular
     contractors for defense services. In some cases the FAR authorizes contracts to be
     awarded without full and open competition. The FMS customer may also request sub-
     contracts be awarded to particular firms. The PCO shall honor such a request from the
     FMS customer only if a Letter of Offer and Acceptance or other written direction is
     provided. Refer to DFARS 225.7304, FMS Customer Involvement and DoD 5105.38-M,
     Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), for further guidance.
         5.3.3.2.1. Each item for FMS must be clearly marked and the requisition number,
         record control number, or the FMS supplementary address provided in the “Mark
         For” portion of the shipping instructions. The requisition number and project name
         should also be included when applicable.
50                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


     5.3.3.3. Outgoing MIPR Year End Review.               Each organization will review all
     outstanding MIPRs, including General Services Administration (GSA) requests, by the
     last business day of August to determine if service contract funding is excess or deficient
     to complete service requirements by the current FY’s last business day.
         5.3.3.3.1. If excess funds are expected, issue a MIPR amendment to cancel the
         surplus services and de-obligate excess funds. If funds are insufficient to complete
         contract terms, issue a MIPR amendment to fund services up to the end of the fiscal
         year (EOFY).
         5.3.3.3.2. Excess funds will not be applied to services occurring in the following FY.
         MIPRs will be reviewed each September to ensure funds are obligated for services
         only rendered in the current FY.
         5.3.3.3.3. The reviewing accounting office will send the MIPR RO a memorandum
         requesting verification the MIPR services terminate at EOFY or directing a MIPR
         amendment to de-obligate the excess funds.
     5.3.3.4. Sole/Selected Source. AF MIPRs originating at AFMC central contracting
     activities for sole/selected source procurement are governed by the provisions in the FAR
     Part 6 and paraphrased in Section 1.14 of this guidance. Note: If the contract is
     determined to be issued as a Sole Source, a justification statement must be prepared and
     attached to the MIPR.
     5.3.3.5. Transportation Charges. Each fiscal year the Financial Management
     Directorate at HQ AFMC publishes the accounting classification purchasing agencies use
     to record first destination transportation charges for shipments. Individual AF MIPRs do
     not carry specific citations for first destination transportation.
  5.3.4. Authorities. In order for a Government agency to provide support services to another
  agency, there must be legal authority like under USC 1535 Economy Act or other specific
  statutory authorities. Most agencies outside of DoD are authorized by statute to provide
  procurement support or other services to Federal agencies. A specific authority must be cited
  in order for the acquiring organization to accept MIPRs and provide the needed support. The
  RO must contact the acquiring organization to determine if the organization has a statutory
  authority to accept the order.
     5.3.4.1. Economy Act Authority: Title 31, United States Code (USC), Section 1535,
     Economy Act. The Economy Act authorized federal agencies to assist each other under
     certain circumstances when the acquiring organization does not have a specific authority
     but agrees to accept an order. The Economy Act is the least used authority for
     purchasing goods and services from non-DoD agencies; it applies only in the absence of a
     more specific interagency acquisition authority. Cite this authority if the organization
     does not have a specific statutory authority.         IAW AFFARS MP 5317.503,
     Determinations and Findings (D&F) Requirements, and DoDI 4000.19, Support
     Agreements, a Determination & Findings (D&F) is required for all Economy Act orders
     sent to a non-DoD agency, regardless of dollar value or frequency, it must be
     approved/signed by a Senior Executive Service (SES) or General Officer, and included
     with the MIPR documentation and attached to the support agreement. The supporting Air
     Force contracting office can advise the RO on the proper D&F coordination routing.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     51


     Refer to AFI 65-116 for D&F examples, but the dollar thresholds are outdated, so
     account for SAT changes in the FAR. Refer to FAR Part 17.5, Interagency Acquisitions,
     and the DoDFMR, Volume 11a, Chapter 3, for additional guidance.
        5.3.4.1.1. DoD Economy Act Orders: DoD agencies can provide requested support
        to other DoD agencies when it is determined it is in the best interest of the US
        Government and the acquiring organization determines capabilities exist to provide
        the support without jeopardizing assigned missions. Agreements on recurring
        requirements with DoD acquiring agencies must be documented on a DD Form 1144,
        Support Agreement (SA). A D&F is not needed because blocks 8 and 9 of the DD
        Form 1144 fulfill that requirement. Requesting agencies must determine if a standing
        SA exists with the acquiring organization prior to submitting a recurring requirement.
        If no SA exists, the RO must work with the installation support agreement manager to
        negotiate a support agreement with the acquiring organization, refer to AFI 25-201
        Support Agreements Procedures for additional guidance.
            5.3.4.1.1.1. No support agreement is required if requesting either (a) a single item
            or one-time service, (b) sale of Working Capital Funds (WCF) mission products
            and services, and (c) intra-governmental sales specifically directed or authorized
            by law. Refer to AFI 65-116 for specific instructions for the DD Form 1144.
            Note: AFI 65-116 states SAs may be referred to as Memorandum of
            Agreement/Understandings (MOA/MOU); however, AFI 25-201 states
            MOA/MOU are conditional agreements and identify the parameters for
            developing a SA. To clarify, AFFARS requires a SA or a DD Form 1144.
     5.3.4.2. Other Specific Statutory MIPR Authorities. Examples of other statutory
     authorities include, but not limited to the following:
        5.3.4.2.1. Project Orders - Title 41 USC 6307, Contracts with Federal
        Government-owned establishments and availability of appropriations. A Project
        Order is an order for work, materiel or requesting the manufacture of materiel in
        support of an approved project issued under the authority contained in Title 41 USC
        6307 where government-owned establishments are considered obligations in the same
        manner as similar orders or contracts placed with commercial manufacturers. Project
        Orders are to be used only within the DoD. If the AF Form 185, Project Order, is not
        available when a project order must be executed, then a DD Form 448, MIPR may be
        used to establish a project order IAW AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
        The organization receiving the AF Form 185 must be capable of manufacturing the
        goods or supplying the services cited under this authority and must not subcontract
        manufacture or commercially procure the requested items/service. Project order
        requests must not be used simply as a means to avert normal contracting protocols.
        Refer to DFAS DE 7010.1R, General Accounting Finance Systems at Base Level,
        and the DoDFMR, Volume 11a, chapter 2, for additional guidance.
        5.3.4.2.2. DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program: Title 10 USC 2309, Allocation
        of Appropriations and Title 10 USC 2311, Assignment and Delegation of
        Procurement Functions and Responsibilities.           Under the DoD Coordinated
        Acquisition Program, contracting responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to
        a single agency or the GSA. Refer to DFARS 208.70, Required Source of Supplies
52                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


         and Services (Coordination of Acquisitions) for additional guidance. Commodity
         assignments are made:
               5.3.4.2.2.1. To departments and agencies by the Deputy Under-Secretary of
               Defense (Logistics).
               5.3.4.2.2.2. To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Under-
               Secretary of Defense (Logistics).
               5.3.4.2.2.3. Outside the contiguous United States (CONUS) by the combatant
               command commander.
               5.3.4.2.2.4. CONUS commodity acquisitions not assigned under this section are
               determined through agency head agreements.
               5.3.4.2.2.5. Agreement may be on a one-time or a continuing basis. An acquiring
               organization’s contracting agency’s acceptance of a requiring organization’s
               MIPR, even if based on an oral communication, constitutes a one-time agreement.
               5.3.4.2.2.6. Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for
               coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for coordinated
               acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements, and distribute them to
               all activities concerned.
         5.3.4.2.3. Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments are
         made to DoD agencies by the Deputy Under-Secretary of Defense (Logistics) and to
         GSA, through agreement with GSA.
  5.3.4.2.4.
         5.3.4.2.5. Franchise Fund. The Franchise Fund was first established by Public Law
         103-356, Title IV, Section 403, Government Management Reform Act of 1994 to
         provide common administrative support services on a competitive and fee basis.
         Franchise fund programs originated within the Environmental Protection Agency
         (EPA), Department of Commerce, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department
         of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Interior, and Department of
         Treasury. Refer to DoD FMR 7000.14-R for additional guidance.
         5.3.4.2.6. Acquisition of Printing and Related Supplies per FAR Part 8. 8,
         Acquisition of Printing and Related Supplies. Government printing must be done by
         or through the Government Printing Office (GPO) per Title 44 Unites States Code
         (USC) Section 501, Government Printing, unless:
               5.3.4.2.6.1. The GPO cannot provide the printing service if:
                  5.3.4.2.6.1.1. An executive agency field printing plant performs the printing
                  per Title 44, United States Code (USC) Section 501 (2);
                  5.3.4.2.6.1.2. An executive agency acquires printing from allotments for
                  contract field printing per Title 44 USC 501 (2)); or
                  5.3.4.2.6.1.3. A statute authorizes printing by an agency other than the GPO.
  5.3.5. Outgoing MIPR Review. The PR/MIPR Cell/review function will ensure the
  appropriate organizations coordinate in a timely and systematic manner to ensure prompt and
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                    53


  effective resource use and support to the field. The Cell/review function will use the
  Outgoing MIPR Checklist to review and process all outgoing MIPR packages. The
  following coordination must occur before the MIPR package can be forwarded to the
  acquiring organization.
     5.3.5.1. Funds certification. Financial Management reviews the MIPR to include
     purpose, time and amount; performs funds certification process and certifies the funds
     availability, adds applicable funds remarks or instructions on the MIPR. At this point no
     changes can be made to the MIPR document. If changes are required the MIPR must be
     cancelled, corrected and resubmitted, or changed by an amendment.Note: Other station
     funds are excluded from certification; however, the certified funding document from the
     requesting organization must be attached.
     5.3.5.2. If the procurement is for a spares buy or deliverable item, PR/MIPR Cell/review
     function will ensure Packaging and Transportation coordinates on the MIPR.
  5.3.6. MIPR Distribution. Upon MIPR authorization, PR/MIPR Cell/review function will
  distribute the MIPR manually or electronically as outlined below:
     5.3.6.1. One complete MIPR package consisting of a signed and dated DD Form 448, all
     required attachments annotated with the MIPR number, MIPR special instructions sheet
     and a DD Form 448-2 with the requiring organization information is forwarded to the
     acquiring organization.
     5.3.6.2. One complete MIPR package consisting of a signed and dated DD Form 448, all
     required attachments annotated with the MIPR number, and MIPR special instructions
     sheet will be maintained as the official case file in the PR/MIPR Cell/review function.
  5.3.7. MIPR Acceptance. Acquiring agencies formally accept a MIPR on a DD Form 448-
  2 as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after MIPR receipt. If the DD Form 448-2 is
  not received within 30-days, the acquiring organization must inform the requiring
  organization of the delay reason and the anticipated MIPR acceptance date. The acquiring
  organization must accept/reject MIPRs in writing before the expiration of the funds by
  completing the DD Form 448-2 IAW DFARS PGI 253.208. Additional guidance can also be
  found in DFARS PGI 208.7004, Coordinated Acquisition Procedures.
     5.3.7.1. Review and Follow Up. The PR/MIPR Cell or review function reviews the DD
     448-2 received from the acquiring organization for completeness and, if acceptable,
     distributes the original signed DD Form 448-2 to the FM and RO/PM. The requiring
     organization PR/MIPR Cell or MIPR RO will initiate a delinquent suspense letter to the
     acquiring organization if a DD Form 448-2 response is not received within 30 days and
     another follow-up 10 days later if not received prior. Units will also establish a process
     that sets the timeframe and incrementally elevates the level of subsequent requests after
     the second follow-up until acceptance is received.
  5.3.8. Contractual Documents. Upon contract receipt, the requiring organization PR/MIPR
  Cell or review function will retain signed copy contract and forward copies to the FM office,
  RO, and others if applicable. The FM office forwards the contract to DFAS for posting.
     5.3.8.1. Follow Up. The FM office receives contracts from multiple sources. Since
     DFAS requires a copy of the contract for Category II MIPRs, if a Category II MIPR
54                                                             AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


     Acceptance is received without a contract, the PR/MIPR Cell/review function must send
     a follow up request for the missing contract. Note: The PR/MIPR Cell/review function
     must receive a contract within 90 days of MIPR Acceptance receipt on all CAT II Direct
     Cite MIPRs. Refer to DFARS PGI 208.7004 for additional guidance.
  5.3.9. Obligation of MIPR Funds. The FM office sends the contract award document for
  Category II direct cite MIPRs to the applicable DFAS field site. DFAS uses the contract
  award document to obligate the funds in the accounting system.
     5.3.9.1. Recording of Obligation for Reimbursable MIPRs (CAT I). The DD Form 448-
     2 is used to obligate funds in the accounting system. The entire amount of the obligation
     is established in the accounting system as a positive unfilled orders outstanding balance.
     5.3.9.2. Monthly Validation Process. The PM or RA/RM must validate all outstanding
     MIPRs monthly to ensure timely invoice processing and excess funds de-obligation. The
     PM or RA/RM should use the Commander’s Resource Information System (CRIS) to run
     an end of each month query. When performing the monthly outstanding MIPR
     validation, it is important for the PM or RA/RM to work with their base FM office to
     confirm balances and resolve discrepancies with the DFAS field site. They also work
     with the acquiring organization to correct any billing discrepancies or adjustments that
     require an amended DD Form 448-2 to ensure invoices are processed in a timely manner
     and allow for the timely obligation/de-obligation of funds.
  5.3.10. MIPR Amendments. All changes to MIPRs, affecting MIPR contents after funds
  certification, require an amendment. Before processing, coordinate amendments with the
  acquiring organization to ensure the affected line items have not been awarded or if there are
  other conditions affecting the amendment. When preparing a MIPR amendment, always fill
  out the basic information and add any changed information/data from the basic MIPR or a
  prior amendment, and include a clear and concise reason for the amendment in the purpose
  statement. Insert N/C in items where there is no change.
     5.3.10.1. If changes occur prior to fund certification, identify the current MIPR location
     and have that office/function return the MIPR to the RO for corrections. The RO will
     make any applicable changes on the original MIPR document and resubmit for
     processing. If changes occur after fund certification, a MIPR amendment will be
     required in all cases.
     5.3.10.2. Required changes to Advance and Planning MIPRs should be made on a

                                          Chapter 6

         PURCHASE REQUESTS, DELIVERY ORDERS, AND AMENDMENTS

6.1. Purchase Requests (PR). PRs are the primary PI tool. They are used to define a
requirement in sufficient detail to allow contracting officers to effectively solicit commercial
offers and efficiently award a contract to procure an item, repair, or service. This guidance
prescribes the PR process AFMC logisticians will use to develop supply chain and product
support requirements into detailed, funds certified, packages that accurately define product
specifications, bona fide need, time purpose and amount, to facilitate contracting procurement
actions.
   6.1.1. Timely, effective, and efficient PR processing is essential to ensure Warfighter’s need
   dates are met. In order to minimize requirement system generated inventory levels, AFMC’s
   acquisition and sustainment activities must continually strive to minimize total ALT.
       6.1.1.1. Forms Used. The AFMC Form 36, Purchase Request, may be used as well as a
       PR system generated report or version of the Form 36. Any version is acceptable as long
       as it contains all the data required by the PCO in an easily recognizable format.
       6.1.1.2. The AFMC Form 36A-F may be used as amendments or continuation sheets if
       room on the Form 36 is insufficient. Some system generated PRs possess expandable
       fields in lieu of continuation sheets. Note: Refer to center level procedural guidance for
       preparation instructions for the AFMC Forms 36 and 36 A through F.
   6.1.2. PR Processing Pre-Requisites. Except for circumstances described in Section 3.2
   (Advance, Planning, Zero Dollar and Funded PI), ROs should validate the requirement or
   program is approved in accordance with the program management policies or requirement
   system policy directives and funds are available for commitment/obligation before placing a
   PI into the coordination process. However, the RO should proceed with pre-PR actions while
   the review is underway, especially if the requirement needs a high-level approval.
       6.1.2.1. Each Center must develop PR Checklists to ensure PR packages have the
       required contents and are coordinated on by the applicable agencies. The checklist may
       be system generated. Base level variants are permissible to accommodate local
       requirements but must be reviewed and approved by the applicable Center in writing.
       AFSC and AFLCMC may develop joint checklists for PR processing at Robins, Tinker,
       and Hill AFBs. This checklist should be completed prior to initiating the PR and may
       include but not limited to:
           6.1.2.1.1. Item/NSN to buy or repair, or the applicable required service or data
           pseudo code.
           6.1.2.1.2. Item/Service Description, or the applicable documents that detail item
           characteristics or repair or service specifications.
           6.1.2.1.3. Quantity.
           6.1.2.1.4. Cost.
           6.1.2.1.5. Fund Cite or the Funds Summary Report and Program Summary Report.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      57


          6.1.2.1.6. Delivery Schedule.
          6.1.2.1.7. Destination/Ship To address or DoDAAC.
          6.1.2.1.8. Existing screening and waiver documents.
          6.1.2.1.9. Applicable MFT meeting minutes
          6.1.2.1.10. Recommended contract or options strategy.
   6.1.3. AFMC Form 36, Purchase Request (PR) Preparation. Depending upon the
   electronic system used to create the PR, the specific actions to develop PRs may be different.
   For instance ADIS requires certain PR data elements and codes that are AFSC and program
   office specific so it can feed IM, PMSs, and PMs contract award status, among other
   functions, that contracting systems supporting other AFMC Centers do not require. Some
   data elements are unique to item/spares buys; others apply to only repair or service requests.
   Also, several systems have different AFMC Form 36 versions and formats. These are
   permissible as long as they provide PCO the information required to adequately solicit the
   requirement, select the best proposal and execute the award. The Form 36 data must be
   easily discernible and preferably sent electronically for funds certification and passed to
   contracting systems.
       6.1.3.1. Each PR must contain a detailed purpose statement to advise the PCO exactly
       what the RO intend to accomplish. State up front whether the PR is a basic (initial
       submission), Advance, Planning, surge, or Zero-Dollar PR (see Chapter 3 for
       descriptions). The RO must state exactly the line item and data element that changed on
       amendments. Centers may include canned purpose statements for the primary types of
       PRs in their Center-level guidance.
       6.1.3.2. If the PCO discovered missing attachments or documents they may request them
       through the PR/MIPR Cell/review function or the RO. However, if a change to the actual
       requirement is needed (e.g. funding or quantity change beyond the approved limits set on
       the PR) the PCO must contact the RO for resolution.
6.2. Delivery Orders Request (DOR). Several contract types allow placing contract orders for
known requirement item buys or anticipated repairs/services but suspends execution until a
future date. These contracts minimize the administrative effort and lead-time when a need
occurs. A DOR executes portions of an existing contract at the discretion of the Air Force.
DORs are submitted to the PCO either on an AFMC Form 36 or a PRPS DOR report.
   6.2.1. Initiating DOR. In addition to the applicable data from the awarded PR; DORs should
   contain:
       6.2.1.1. A detailed purpose statement saying the purpose is to place an order against an
       existing contract and annotate the contract number and contractor name.
       6.2.1.2. The estimated unit and total line item price for the requested quantity.
       6.2.1.3. Any remarks or supporting data or attachments specific to the DOR action not
       included in the awarded PR or contract.
6.3. PR Amendments. After funds certification, any change to a basic PR or attachment must
be recorded using the amendment process in order to track requirement changes. Amendments
must clearly distinguish between the changed and unchanged data elements. An amendment can
 58                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


apply to an entire un-awarded PR or individual un-awarded PR line item. The RO must obtain
PCO concurrence that a proposed change can be executed prior to submitting an amendment.
   6.3.1. Amendments are submitted to the PCO either on an AFMC Form 36 or a PRPS
   amendment action. Clearly state the reason for the amendment in the PR purpose field, e.g.,
   Change PI data, Add an Attachment, Cancel a Line Item, Total Cancellation Amendment
   (TCA), etc., identify the affected line item(s) and specify exactly what requires changing.
   Also include the name of the PCO contacted in the purpose field. PRs requiring significant
   changes should be cancelled and re-submitted.
      6.3.1.1. Any post award changes increasing cost or quantity to any line item awarded on
      the basic PR require a new PR with a reference to the awarded contract to ensure proper
      coordination and tracking. The RO must initiate requests to decrease funding or
      quantities on awarded line items by contacting the PCO who uses the contract
      termination process in the FAR Part 49, Termination of Contracts to reduce awarded
      items/services.
   6.3.2. Amendments to add a stock number as a “sub-line item” will not be accepted if the
   basic line item is pseudo coded (service) or if the National Stock Number (NSN) item is not
   already established on the basic PR. Amendments to add pseudo-coded items must use a
   new line item number.
   6.3.3. PR amendments are used to accomplish the following changes to un-awarded PRs/line
   items:
      6.3.3.1. Add or cancel related line item or sub line items associated to an existing line
      item on the basic PR, e.g. adding a data requirement to a services PR.
      6.3.3.2. Change or add attachments.
      6.3.3.3. Increase, decrease or cancel line item quantity or cost. Note: If the dollar value
      changes from the basic PI or subsequent amendments, indicate the amount increased or
      decreased in the applicable fields and the adjusted grand total in the accounting portion of
      AFMC Form 36.
      6.3.3.4. Change data elements that do not change the scope of the basic PR or previous
      amendments.
      6.3.3.5. Update expired data (e.g. AMC/AMSC, RMC/RMSC) occurring between funds
      certification and contract award.
      6.3.3.6. Change any fund cite information or cost figures unless otherwise directed.
      6.3.3.7. Amend an item National Stock Number (NSN) or other indicative data resulting
      from a stock list change action. Contract modifications will be made by the PCO. If a
      line item has been awarded, a new PR referencing the involved contract is required.
      6.3.3.8. If Quantity Range line items, as defined in Variation In Quantity (VIQ)
      Provisions, Section 3.2.5 of this guidance, are within quantity range on basic PI an
      amendment is not required.
      6.3.3.9. If a Center chooses to utilize Advance or Planning PRs and need to pass changes
      or updates to the PCO, the RO must either:
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      59


          6.3.3.9.1. Refrain from changing Advance/Planning PRs until after processing a
          funded PR to establish the basic record in ABSS. Unless preapproved by the PCO,
          the funded PR can only alter the basic Advance/Planning PR funding data; otherwise,
          any other change must be processed on a subsequent amendment to the funded PR.
          6.3.3.9.2. Cancel the Advanced/Planning PR and process a revised
          Advanced/Planning PR or a funded PR if the requirement is ready for commitment.
          6.3.3.9.3. Devise a system generated process to send the PCO changes to
          Advance/Planning PRs, via an Advanced or Planning PR Amendment. The system
          must record all advance/planning PR changes/revisions and ensure the funded PR
          sent to ABSS for certification is identified as the basic (00) PR. After the basic is
          certified in ABSS, the PR can be amended to record changes.
          6.3.3.9.4. Centers can develop other processes or procedures to send the PCO
          Advanced and Planning PRs amendments or changes. However, this process or
          procedure must be coordinated and approved by the Center logistics/acquisition,
          finance and contracting functional leads.      Temporary agreements must be
          documented; long-term processes must be incorporated into the Center’s
          implementing guidance to this instruction. The data produced in the coordinated
          process must be retrievable and auditable.
   6.3.4. Coordination of Amendments. Upon receipt of a PR amendment, the following
   guidelines apply to amendment coordination:
       6.3.4.1. Any change to funds information (amount or fund cite) must be coordinated with
       the Resource Advisor (RA) and ALO.
       6.3.4.2. Any change in delivery information (schedule or destination) must be
       coordinated with the transportation function.
       6.3.4.3. Other changes should be coordinated with the agencies that coordinated on the
       basic PR.
   6.3.5. PR Cancellation Amendment. Normally, only the PR RO can cancel a PR;
   however, the PCO can recommend PR cancellations because they cannot be awarded in a
   reasonable time, require extensive re-work, or other pertinent circumstances. As stated
   above, amendments MUST be coordinated with the PCO prior to processing. When
   cancelling a PR or line item, enter a reason statement in PR purpose field clearly stating the
   PR is cancelled in its entirety (a TCA) or a specific line item. Note: PRPS has a TCA
   function.
6.4. PR Documentation Management. The preferred storage method for completed PRs is in
an electronic repository. If mandated for use, units will use PRPS as the official logistics
repository and will maintain a PR system file. (Refer to AF Manual 33-363 Management of
Records)
   6.4.1. Contracting retains the official completed PR package.
   6.4.2. PR files shall be maintained in accordance with the AF Records Information
   Management System (AFRIMS), Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
60                                                        AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


  6.4.3. If a document is lost, the duplicate will be plainly marked "DUPLICATE PR", and
  will be identical (including all attachments) to the lost package.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                       61


                                           Chapter 7

          PURCHASE INSTRUMENT (PI) SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

7.1. General. This chapter provides an explanation for some of the supporting documentation
the RO may need to assemble a procurable PI package as specified in center-level procedures.
7.2. Acquisition Plans (AP). The purpose of acquisition planning is to ensure government (the
Warfighter) requirements are met in the most effective, economical and timely manner. The AP
contains a clear description of the user’s requirement, market research findings, risks involved,
forecast CLIN structure, contract type by CLIN and any unique aspects of the acquisition. In
order to develop a sound acquisition strategy, AFMC acquisition personnel should engage the
local Acquisition Centers of Excellence (ACE) and others as appropriate, including Contracting,
Financial Management, Staff Judge Advocate, the lead MAJCOM and other technical/functional
experts . The Program Manager, or other official responsible for the program, has overall
responsibility for acquisition planning. Refer to FAR Part 7, Acquisition Planning; DFARS
Subpart 207.1, Acquisition Plans; DFARS PGI 207.1, Acquisition Plans and DFARS PGI
207.105, Contents of Written Acquisition Plans for additional instructions.
7.3. AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document (MORD). A MORD
is a temporary obligating document or, in rare cases, a document in lieu of an actual obligating
document. It is used to temporarily record known obligations or reimbursements when the
required documents to support the obligation/reimbursable transactions are not immediately
available. The obligation amount may be estimated and the estimate can be revised when the
actual obligation amount is known. A MORD is used as financial document place holder for
requirements when the transactions must be executed before the actual funding document will be
recorded prior to the end of a fiscal period, e.g., EOY, EOM, or if the document is not physically
available, i.e., stuck in electronic coordination. MORDs may not be used to set aside or reserve
funds in the accounting records before an obligation occurs. The MORD should be reversed
when the actual document becomes available.
   7.3.1. In logistics applications, MORDs are used to fund the GFM Unit Repair Cost
   associated with a contract delivery order. For instance, a MORD must be used to cover
   contractor expenses prior to incurring costs in excess of the actual awarded amount to
   prevent potential Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) violations or contractor work stoppage. When
   applicable, MORD amendments must be accomplished prior to customer funding expiration.
   7.3.2. Refer to SAF/FMP (AFAFO) Processing Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement
   Documents (MORD) Guide, 24 July 2011, AFMC Financial Management Handbook
   (Financial Management Reference System [FMRS]) August 2002 Chapter 30 - Funding
   Documents and AFMCI 21-149 for additional guidance.
7.4. AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA) or DD Form 448, Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). Form used by Air Force agencies to authorize
another organization to cite their funds on an obligation document. This provides the recipient
agency a target amount of funds available for obligation to support specific tasks. Refer to AFI
65-601 for additional guidance on AF Form 616. If the DD Form 448 serves as a Fund Cite
Authorization and commitment document then the DD form 448-2 serves as the obligation
 62                                                                AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


document. Refer to DFARS PGI 253.208-1 and DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental
Purchase Request for additional guidance on the use of these forms for fund cite authorization.
7.5. AFMC Form 8, GFM/Loan/Lease Availability/Supportability Request/Acquisition
Assessment. This form is used when the responsible technical specialist identifies there is a
potential or actual use of Government Furnished Property (GFP) in the production of the item
(GFP includes Government Furnished Equipment and Materiel [GFE/GFM]). This is based on
the identification of stock-listed items within the end item. If the ES determines that the item
contains no stock-listed components this acquisition assessment is discarded.
7.6. AFMC Form 158, Packaging Requirements. PIs and other procurement documents for
hardware, spares, supplies, etc., must be coordinated with the applicable packaging specialists to
ensure packaging specifications, e.g. Special Packaging Instructions (SPI), are included in item
buy and repair contracts to ensure assets are properly packaged for transit. This function can be
performed as a PI activity in PR systems like PRPS, or as a PI attachment. AFMC Form 158 can
only be signed by a qualified Packaging Specialist. Packaging requirements provided for
contracting purposes shall be complete, accurate and in compliance with AFMCI 24-201 AFMC
Packaging & Materials Handling Policies and Procedures.
7.7. AFMC Form 191, Foreign Disclosure Procurement Decision Worksheet, (Optional
Use). For contract performance accomplished outside the continental United States, the ES,
Engineer or the PMS, will complete the worksheet and coordinate with the Foreign Disclosure
Office (FDO). Initiators contemplating award of a contract or subcontract to a foreign contractor
must first ascertain whether the complete spectrum of US Government military information
required for contract performance can be disclosed under the disclosure policies. All proposed
disclosures, to include Invitation for Bid and Request for Proposal or award of a contract will not
be made to foreign governments, their representatives, foreign contractors, or foreign nationals,
including those holding foreign reciprocal clearances, until approved by the FDO. Failure to
meet this requirement could result in awarding contracts which cannot be completely or
adequately performed because of danger to the security of the US Government, or could require
costly termination. Refer to AFI 16-201 and AFMCI 21-149 for additional guidance.
7.8. AFMC Form 200, Accelerated Delivery Request (ADR). The ADR is utilized to request
the PCO renegotiate delivery if an asset is required earlier than specified on a current contract
delivery schedule. It is initiated by the RO and provided to the appropriate PCO. The PCO will
negotiate a schedule with the contractor and forward the completed ADR to the RO. ADR
requests must be processed as emergency/urgent requirements to ensure timely processing.
7.9. AFMC Form 221, Repair Parts Kit List Worksheet. The AFMC Form 221 is a list of
items for supplying support to equipment, aircraft etc. representing an effective and economical
method of supply support. A repair parts kit is a group of parts or materiel, identified as one line
item, used to restore an assembly or subassembly to a serviceable condition. Parts and materiel
selected for inclusion within repair kits are procured, stocked, requisitioned, and used as one line
item. For additional guidance and instructions on completion of form refer to AFMCMAN 25-1,
Repair Parts Kit User’s Manual.
7.10. AFMC Form 260, First Article Requirement. First article requirements are used to
ensure a new potential source’s product conforms to specified contract requirements. It applies
to vendors as well as manufacturers; however, first article requirements should not be used for
normal commercially available products as specified in FAR Part 9.3, First Article Testing and
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                        63


Approval. First article solicitations or PIs contain detailed technical requirements and adequate
quality assurance provisions to ensure the contractor can furnish or manufacture the item. The
engineer determines if first article inspection is required during technical screening and
document findings. The decision is based on careful consideration of: the item’s technical
aspects, first article testing costs, safety risk of not testing, impacts to delivery schedule, and
other pertinent factors. If FA testing is required an AFMC Form 260 must be provided in the PI
package. Refer to FAR Part 9.3, FAR 52.209, Qualification Requirements and AFMCI 64-110,
First Article Management, for additional guidelines. Note: AFMCI 64-110 is under revision and
will be re-designated a 2X- series publication.
7.11. AFMC Form 270, Request for Issuance of Shipping Instructions. This form can be used
for Initial Shipping Instructions (ISI) or for Amended Shipping Instructions (ASI).
   7.11.1. The ISI is utilized when initial shipping instructions were not provided on the
   original purchase instrument. The requested delivery date must be no later than 60 days prior
   to the first scheduled delivery. The ISI is initiated by requirement owner and routed to the
   appropriate PCO. Under no circumstances will the RO establish direct contact with the
   contractor to request or task initial or amended shipping instructions without PCO
   involvement.
   7.11.2. The ASI is utilized when changes to shipping instruction are required. These
   changes are limited to quantity and destination. Initiated by requirement owner and routed to
   the appropriate PCO. Under no circumstances will the RO establish direct contact with
   contractor to request or task initial or amended shipping instructions.
7.12. AFMC Form 338, MYC Request Contract Information. When the requirement owner or
MFT determines the requirement quantities can be forecasted with a reasonable degree of
accuracy over several years and a long term strategy would be advantageous to the government,
they may submit an AFMC Form 338 to pass their recommendation to the PCO. Multi-year
contracts should be considered for every procurement and utilized whenever possible.
7.13. AFMC Form 761, AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet (SAW) Report. The
SAW provides item description and information, screening evaluation remarks, the
AMC/AMSC, and miscellaneous spares information the PCO requires. It verifies the current
competitive status and checks source development efforts prior to contract procurement. A SAW
can be initiated for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Engineering and/or IM requests, and
Contractor Inventory Control Point (ICP) items. PRPS is the AFMC repository for screening
actions at Hill, Tinker and Robins AFBs. All SAW actions must be performed in PRPS. Refer to
center-level procedural guidance for preparation instructions and DFARS PGI 217.7506, Spare

Support Policy and Procedure Desk Book, November 1, 2002 for other supporting information.
7.14. AFMC Form 762, Contract Repair Screening Analysis Worksheet (CRSAW). The
CRSAW records factors and decisions used to facilitate the Contract Repair Process for an item.
It is required in all contract repair service PI packages. The CRSAW documents the repairable
asset technical screening process prior to contract repair service procurement to ensure the repair
meets the documented technical requirements. It is an effective mechanism to determine and
capture the RMC/RMSC and approved commercial repair sources. PRPS is the AFMC
repository for screening actions at Hill, Tinker and Robins AFBs all CRSAW actions must be
 64                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


performed in PRPS. Refer to AFMCI 21-149 for preparation instructions and additional
guidance.
7.15. AFMC Form 762A, Repair Data List (RDL). RDL provides a listing of all applicable
documents, software, tooling, test equipment, and/or other items necessary to accomplish a
repair. RDL is required when “Technical Orders Required” is indicated on CRSAW. Refer to
AFMCI 21-113 for step by step instructions to complete the AFMC Form 762A.
7.16. AFMC Form 807, Recommended Quality Assurance Provisions and Special Inspection
Requirements. The technical authority provides contract quality requirements for all buys for
new manufactured materiel and all repairs. Quality provisions annotated on the AFMC Form
807 will not be downgraded without technical authority coordination. The technical authority is
the chief/lead engineer for a system/end-item. The chief/lead engineer may delegate technical
authority to a qualified and competent individual. Refer to AFMCI 63-1201, Implementing
Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) and Life Cycle System Engineering
(LCSE), and FAR Part 46, Quality Assurance, for additional guidance.
7.17. AFMC Form 813, Surplus Materiel Worksheet. This worksheet is used to evaluate all
categories of surplus materiel (commercial and government surplus and/or new manufactured).
It captures condition categories: new and unused; new and reconditioned; new and modified;
used and overhauled.
7.18. Airmunitions Specification (Air Spec). Munitions functional experts develop a checklist
used to procure airmunitions requirements (e.g., replenish stock, services, FMS buys) that
replaces official data call meetings. The Air Spec is generally a word document identifying
unique munitions requirements including hazardous classifications, specific shipping
requirements and any other munitions organization concerns. The Air Spec specifies how
Cartridge Actuated Device (CAD)/Propellant Actuated Device (PAD) items are marked,
shipments reported, and identifies any specialized applicable hazardous class and explosive
markings the shipment needs. The PM, ES, or MM prepares the checklist and uses the
information to complete the Air Spec, obtains Data Management Officer (DMO) approval, and
attaches it to the PI.
7.19. Bid Set. A bid set is a technical description taken from the EDL/RDL and defines the
required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequate data is provided to
manufacture/repair an item. The AMC/AMSC or RMC/RMSC on a SAW/CRSAW determines
if a Bid Set is required. The bid set is uploaded into FedBizOpps and consists of all applicable
technical data such as drawings, engineering orders, associated lists, specifications and standards
required for future procurement. Refer to AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical
Information, and DFARS 252.227, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for rights in bid
or proposal information and dissemination guidance.
7.20. Commercial Item Description (CID). A CID is an indexed, simplified product
functional or performance characteristic description used if an acceptable commercial product
(Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)) item is available that satisfies the government need and
used in lieu of a SAW. The CID is a concise, descriptive document that explains the requirement
to potential suppliers in simple language. Market research is important to determine whether an
available or acceptable commercial product exists. CIDs are used when no non-government
standard exists. Refer to DoD 4120.24-M, Appendix 4, Defense Standardization Program (DSP)
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                          65


Policies and Procedures for CID preparation instructions and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of
Commercial Items guidance.
7.21. Data Item Descriptions (DIDs). A DID defines the intended use, preparation
instructions, content and format requirements for a specific data product. TMCM-86-01, USAF
Technical Manual Contract Requirements defines the required format and content for technical
orders and manuals. Only the data listed on the CDRL will be delivered, therefore, the data
requestor must consult with the DMOs with the data and CDRL responsibility to ensure the
desired data is obtained correctly. A standard DID must be used if available and appropriate;
however, a one-time DID may be used if a standard DID does not apply or cannot be tailored
sufficiently. Evaluators must determine if the required data is currently available in their area; if
data is on order; or if a test report is needed while reviewing potential data buy requirements.
   7.21.1. Only the data type OPR may submit a PI for certain requirement data, i.e., only the
   Engineering DMO may submit engineering data/drawings PIs. DIDs may require tailoring to
   eliminate procuring unneeded sections of reports. For guidelines and instructions on
   preparing and processing a DID refer to MIL-STD-963B, Military Standard Data Item
   Descriptions.
7.22. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. The Contract Security
Classification Specification conveys the applicable classification and declassification
specifications to contractors for a classified solicitation, contract or subcontract. It defines the
contractor security clearance level required to access, process, store, and transmit classified
items/information during the contract period and destroy all classified information upon contract
completion. Additionally, the National Industrial Security Program requires contractors to
ensure all subcontractors are aware of and meet the security requirements. The RO will request a
Contract Security Classification Specification from the Servicing Security Agency if the PI
package contains classified information about the work to be done, information, or end user
involved, or if a deliverable item requires security protection. The DD Form 254 is included in
the PI’s supporting technical data and ensures the PCO properly screens prospective offerors for
the required clearance. It identifies the information or items requiring protection and the
applicable parts of the Safeguarding Classified Information guidance for the PCO and the
contractor. For instructions on completing the form and additional guidance and information
refer to AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, DoD 5220.22-R, FAR Part 4
Subpart Part 4.4, Administrative Matters-Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry
and AFMCI 21-149. Note: The overall Federal guidance is the National Industrial Security
Program Manual (NISPOM), reissued February 28, 2006.
7.23. DD Form 1144, Support Agreement. A DD Form 1144, Support Agreement, documents
an agreement between two units for recurring support. If a potential recurring requirement
occurs, the requiring organization must determine if a support agreement between the two
agencies exists. If none does, the PM must work with the installation support agreement
manager to negotiate an agreement for recurring support. Support agreements may be intra-
agency (between DoD federal agencies) or interagency (between DoD and non-DoD federal
agencies). No support agreement is required for provision of: (a) a single item or one-time
service; (b) sale of Working Capital Funds (WCF) mission products and services; and (c) intra-
governmental sales specifically directed or authorized by law. Refer to DoDI 4000.19, AFI Supp
25-201, Support Agreement Procedures Supplement, and AFI 65-116 footnotes for additional
guidance.
 66                                                               AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


7.24. DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). The CDRL identifies
potential data requirements, in a standard DoD format, the PCO uses to solicit and award
contracts for data requirements. A data requirement entails any need associated with the
development, generation, preparation, modification, maintenance, storage, retrieval, and/or
delivery of data. The government must determine, to the extent feasible, its data requirements in
time for inclusion in solicitations. Data format and content are established by DoD Acquisition
Management Systems and Data Requirements Control List Clearance Office approved data
acquisition documents (with the exception of one-time DIDs) per DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures
for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data. The data requestor must verify data will
be obtained correctly with the DMO responsible for required data and CDRL requirements. Any
PI line item ordering data the government requires must be specified and scheduled through the
CDRL approval process. Refer to DoD 5010.12-M for CDRL instructions and DFARS 252.227,
Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for guidance in purchasing data.
7.25. DD Form 1653, Transportation Data for Solicitations. Transportation Specialists use
this form to: (a) make International Commerce Term (INCOTERM) recommendations to obtain
the most advantageous shipping term for the government for a particular procurement, and other
suggested transportation provisions for solicitation inclusion; (b) include information on
combined port handling and transportation charges for inclusion in the solicitation in connection
with export shipments. For additional information and guidance refer to DFARS 247.371, DD
Form 1653, Transportation Data for Solicitations.
7.26. DD Form 2169, Special Packaging Instructions (SPI). SPIs offer superior protection of
expensive, mission critical materiel by preventing damage during handling, shipping and storage
of materiel. SPI and T.O. differences should be coordinated and corrected IAW AFI24-203,
Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo, and T.O. 00-5-3, USAF Technical Order Life
Cycle Management. The SPI must be completed by the Packaging Specialist. Refer to MIL-
STD 2073-1, Military Standard Practice for Military Packages and MIL-STD-129, Military
Standard for Military Marking for Shipment and Storage for additional guidance.
7.27. Economy Act. The Economy Act authorizes federal agencies to order goods or services
from or through other federal agencies and pay the actual costs of the goods or services provided:
(1) funds are available; (2) the requiring organization head decides ordering through another
Federal agency is in the government’s best interest; (3) the agency asked to fill the order can
provide the ordered goods or services; and (4) the requiring agency’s leadership determines a
commercial enterprise cannot provide the ordered goods or services as conveniently or
economically. Refer to section 5.3.4.1 of this publication, AFI 65-116; DoD FMR Volume 11a,
Chapter 3; FAR Part 17; DFARS 208 and DoDI 4000.19. For each Economy Act Order one of
the following must be used:
   7.27.1. Determinations and Findings (D&F). An authorized official’s written approval
   required by statute or regulation that is a prerequisite to taking certain contract actions. The
   “determination” is a conclusion or decision supported by “findings”. The “findings” are facts
   or rationale used to make the determination and must meet applicable statute or regulation
   requirements. Refer to FAR Part 17.503 for additional guidance.
   7.27.2. DD Form 1144, Support Agreement. See section 7.23.
7.28. Engineering Data List (EDL). An EDL is a list of drawing numbers for specific items;
information that describes Technical Data Package used in competitive solicitations for an item
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     67


buy; and special instructions used to build a Bid Set. EDLs contain manufacturing specifications
and drawings, and data from other Air Force sources. These documents aid vendors in
producing a particular system or piece of equipment. An EDL is required when indicated on the
SAW.
7.29. Green Procurement Program (GPP). Green Procurement is defined by DoD as the
purchase of environmentally preferable products and services in accordance with federally
mandated green purchasing preference programs. The DoD requires each agency establish a
program to stress procurement of environmentally friendly products. It also requires contractors
to use green products while performing services provided the item/service can be competitively
sourced within a reasonable period of time, at reasonable prices, or meets reasonable
performance standards in specification. A written determination by technical or requirements
personnel of the performance standard reasonableness must be included with the justification and
included in the PCO’s contract file if requesting an exemption from this policy. The purpose of
the GPP documentation is to enhance and sustain mission readiness through cost effective
procurement that achieves compliance, and reduces resource consumption, and solid/hazardous
waste generation. GPP documentation is required in all PI packages. This can be satisfied by
either a separate attached document or a PI system text entry. Refer to Title 42, United States
Code, Section 6962, (Federal Procurement) and Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.): Title
40.247, Comprehensive Procurement Guideline for Products Containing Recovered Materials,
for additional guidance.
   7.29.1. ROs may initiate GPP documentation but will require technical assistance from the
   equipment specialist (ES) and engineer to complete. The engineer ensures the review occurs
   and is documented in the PI package.
7.30. Industrial Safety and Health Requirements. System safety provisions and requirements
will be acquired from the weapon system safety program officer. Safety personnel must review
SOWs, PWS, SOOs, and SONs, regardless of the dollar amount or the hours to be worked in the
contract. This requirement is separate from the VPP requirements. The Industrial Safety and
Health Requirements must be attached to the PI. Also refer to the Occupational, Safety and
Health Act, Public Law 91-596, and the resulting OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910 and 1926.
7.31. Inherently Governmental Function (IGF) Determination. An IGF Determination must
be included in all service/repair PIs unless provided in a RAD. The Installation/Wing Manpower
Office must provide written affirmation the requested activities are not inherently governmental
and an inherently governmental assessment to support the PCO’s determination that the PI
complies with FAR Part 7.503(d), Acquisition Planning – Inherently Governmental Functions-
Policy, in accordance with policies and procedures prescribed in DFARS 207.503(S-70),
Acquisition Planning – Inherently Governmental Functions.
7.32. Interagency Agreement. An interagency agreement identifies requirements obtained
from an agency outside DoD. Example: Air Force unit forwards a MIPR to GSA and an order is
placed for supplies/services for the Air Force from an existing contract. GSA is the interagency
acquiring agency. Refer to AFI 65-116 for additional guidance.
7.33. International Agreement Competitive Restriction (IACR). IACR is used in lieu of a
J&A when a FMS PI requires a particular source per treaty or international agreement and
specified in official written direction such as a LOA. DFARS 206.302-4, authorizes the use of
 68                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


OTF&OC under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(4), Contracts: Competition
Requirements.
7.34. Intra-agency agreement. An intra-agency agreement identifies requirements obtained
from an agency within DoD. Example: An Air Force unit forwards a MIPR to the Army and an
order is placed for supplies/services for the Air Force from an existing contract. The Army is the
intra-agency acquiring agency. Refer to AFI 65-116.
7.35. Justification and Approval (J&A). A J&A is the document used most frequently to
approve the use of other than full & open competition. The J&A must detail the
rationale/research for OTF&OC and documents the required higher level approvals for sole
source justification or limited competitions as required by the Competition in Contracting Act.
For dollar threshold refer to FAR. For additional guidelines refer to FAR Part 6.3, AFFARS
5306.3, and Title 10 USC 2304(c).
7.36. Justification Qualification Requirements (JQR). A JQR justifies the government
decision to spend money to qualify a company as a source and specifies why the source’s
qualifications must be demonstrated before contract award. For additional information refer to
FAR Part 9.202, Section (a) Qualifications Requirements - Policy.
7.37. Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). The LOA is the document that authorizes the
US Government to procure something for a foreign government. If the LOA directs procurement
from a particular source (s), then an IACR must be prepared. LOAs are prepared pursuant to
DFARS 206.302-4, which authorizes the use of OTF&OC and under the authority of Title 10
USC 2304(c)(4).
7.38. Market Research. Provide the information garnered from analyzing market place
capabilities, technology, and competitive forces to identify optimal sources or market conditions
that best satisfy the organization’s supply or service needs. Market research will be conducted
on all procurements over the simplified acquisition threshold and in other situations specified in
FAR Part 10.001 (a)(2). The outcome of market research must contain the techniques used to
conduct the research, identify sources, and identify whether it is a commercial or non-
commercial part or service. If the item or service is commercial, additional market practices
information is required. Market research provides the technical and business information
necessary to support the procurement decision process. The written summary of the market
research is done by the program office, as well as, result of a cooperative effort by contracting
personnel, technical personnel, Small Business Office (SBO), and the Small Business
Administration/Procurement Center Representative (SBA/PCR). Refer to FAR Part 10 for
additional guidance.
7.39. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). These memorandums define general areas of
conditional agreement between two or more parties – what one party does depends on what the
other party does such as one party provides the support if the other party provides the material.
MOAs to establish responsibility for recurring reimbursable support should be supplemented
with support agreements that define the support, basis for reimbursement for each category of
support, the billing and payment process, and other terms and conditions of the agreement.
7.40. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). These memorandums define general areas of
understanding between two or more parties. They explain what each party plans to do, however,
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                      69


what each party does is not dependent on what the other party does and generally does not
require reimbursement or other support.
7.41. Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Waiver. No DoD contract may request or authorize
class I ozone-depleting substance use unless authorized by a general officer or a Senior
Executive Service civilian in the requiring organization’s organization in accordance with Public
Law 102-484, Section 326, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. This
restriction is in addition to any imposed by the Clean Air Act and applies after June 1, 1993, to
all DoD contracts, regardless of performance. If a waiver is required because ODS use is
unavoidable, the approved waiver must accompany the PI. The waiver lifts ODS storage
restrictions and/or allows contractors to use ODSs while performing services for the Air Force.
Procedures are outlined in AFFARS 5323, Environment, Energy & Water Efficiency, Renewable
Energy Technologies, Occupational Safety, and Drug Free Workplace, and DFARS 223,
Environment, Energy & Water Efficiency, Renewable Energy Technologies, Occupational
Safety, and Drug Free Workplace.
7.42. Performance Plan (PP). See QASP (see 7.45).
7.43. Performance Work Statement (PWS). A PWS defines requirements in terms of results
rather than the method of performing the work. It is a statement that identifies the technical,
functional and performance based characteristics of the agency’s requirements. The PWS
describes the agency’s needs (the “what”), not specific methods for meeting those (the “how”).
The PWS identifies essential outcomes to be achieved, specifies the agency’s required
performance standards and specifies the location, units, quality and timeliness of the work. The
PWS describes the required performance results in clear, specific and objective terms with
measurable outcomes for a Performance-based Services Acquisition (PBSA). At a minimum a
PWS includes:
   7.43.1. Description of Services/General Information (definitions, etc.)
   7.43.2. Services Summary (SS)
7.43.3. Government-Furnished Property (GFP) and Services, if applicable.
   7.43.4. Appendices such as workload estimates, labor hour rates, square footage, industrial
   safety and health provisions, etc.
7.44. Purchase Descriptions (PDs). A PD may be used when no satisfactory standardization
document exists to buy products. Purchase descriptions are used to competitively solicit and
contract for an item, and are limited to one-time buys, small purchases, or when the development
of a standardization document is not considered cost effective. Refer to DoD 4120.24-M
Appendix 1 for additional guidance.
7.45. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). A CRT or CET may either prepare the
quality assurance surveillance plan (formerly referred to as a performance plan) or require the
offerors to submit a proposed quality assurance surveillance plan for the government’s
consideration in development of the Government’s plan. It specifies when government contract
quality assurance shall be performed (including any stage of manufacture or performance of
services) and where (including subcontractors’ plants) and the frequency necessary to determine
if the supplies or services conform to contract requirements throughout its life cycle. Quality
assurance surveillance plans should be prepared in conjunction with the PWS.
 70                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


7.46. Qualification Requirement (QR). The QR ensures the qualification of new sources are
submitted with complete information and evaluated thoroughly and consistently. It formalizes
the activities to ensure technical oversight of the pre-award source qualification process. Refer
to AFMCI 21-149 for additional guidance. Note: A Materiel Qualification Requirement (MQR)
is used by some organizations for specific item types e.g., F100 engines.
7.47. Requirement Approval Document (RAD). The RAD is the formal document required to
obtain approval for contract support services. The RAD identifies the category of service and
provides the rationale as to why your purchase should be contracted rather than organically
performed. A RAD should be started prior to initiating a PI and must be approved prior to
contract award. PM shall use the AFMC Services Database to document contract support service
requirements and initiate the RAD to accompany the PI. The RAD approval authority validation
signifies that the requirement cannot be supported organically. Refer to AFMCI 63-403,
Contract Support Services Requirements Approval Process, for additional information and
guidance.
7.48. Sole Source Justification (SSJ). SSJs are types of J&A. Technical and requirements
personnel are responsible for providing and certifying accurate and complete data necessary to
support their recommendation for other than full and open competition (OTF&OC). The
justification must demonstrate that only one company can perform, e.g., supplies or services are
unique to a contractor, time is of the essence and only one known source can meet the
government needs within the required time frame, data is unavailable for competitive
procurement; and it is necessary that the item being acquired from the one source be compatible
and interchangeable with existing equipment. For dollar threshold refer to FAR Part 6.302,
Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.
7.49. Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP). The SORAP is part of the total Depot
Source of Repair (DSOR). It is the primary process the Air Force uses to posture depot level
workloads for both hardware and software. It applies to both new acquisition and fielded
programs. Refer to AFI 63-101 for more details.
7.50. Source Qualification Statement (SQS). Prior to contract award, there must be a
justification for establishing a requirement qualification and establishing the reason why a
qualification requirement is demonstrated. A potential offeror seeking approval as a qualified
source must meet the specified SQS requirements established by the engineers. Refer to AFMCI
21-149 for additional guidance.
7.51. Special Test (Tooling)/Special Test Equipment (ST/STE) Procedures. ST/STEs
indicate special tools or testing are required and whether the government owns the required
ST/STE.      This is determined during item technical screening or Statement of
Objective/Statement of Work/Maintenance Work Specification/Work Description Document
(SOO/SOW/MWS/WDD) preparation. Refer to AFMCI 21-149 for additional guidance.
   7.51.1. Special Test Equipment (STE). STE consists of interconnected/interdependent
   items or equipment assemblies, including standard or general purpose items or components,
   brought together to become a new functional entity for ST purposes. They are single or
   multipurpose integrated test units engineered, designated, fabricated, or modified to
   accomplish special purpose testing in the direct performance of contract maintenance. It
   does not include consumable property, special tooling, buildings, materiel, ST facilities
   (except foundations and similar improvements necessary for installing special test
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     71


   equipment, plant equipment items or similar capital items used for general plant testing
   purposes). Refer to FAR 45.301.
   7.51.2. Special Tooling (ST). Special tooling refers to all specialized jigs, dies, fixtures,
   molds, patterns, taps, gauges, other equipment, and manufacturing aids and replacements
   designed for a specific project and cannot be used otherwise without substantial modification
   or alteration.
7.52. Statement of Need (SON). The SON summarizes the technical and contractual history of
the acquisition. It should include feasible acquisition alternatives, the impact of prior
acquisitions on those alternatives, and any related in-house effort. Refer to FAR Part 7.105,
Contents of Written Acquisition Plan, for additional guidance.
7.53. Statement of Objective (SOO). The overall performance objectives are documented and
used in solicitations when the government intends to provide the maximum flexibility to each
offeror to propose an innovative approach. Refer to FAR Part 2.1, for additional guidance.
7.54. Statement of Work (SOW). A detailed description of the services a contractor is
required to perform, written by the PM or designee, that describes the desired results,
performance measures, and other instructions as necessary. The SOW establishes the bona-fide
need of the government. This document shall include the work to be performed, location of
work, POP, deliverable schedule, applicable performance standards, and any special
requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, and special knowledge). Refer to FAR 8.405-2
(b), and 37.602 for additional guidance.
7.55. Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS). SASS simply refers to the
minimum documentation needed for actions that require a documented acquisition plan IAW
SAP in FAR Part 13. AFFARS 5307.104-92, Air Force Procedures For Acquisition Plans (AP),
lists several exemptions including replenishment spares not requiring design, development or
testing before production, and modification within the contract scope, among others. The SASS
is a tool used to accomplish acquisition planning documentation required in FAR 7.1, and
detailed in AFFARS 5307.104-92.
7.56. Supply Information (Government Property Management), Appendix B. Appendix B
of a PI provides detailed management and control instructions for government-owned property
and instructions/guidance on how to obtain, maintain, protect, control, account for, and dispose
of GFM/GFE. These instructions expand on FAR Part 45.5, Government Property – Support
Government Property Administration, guidance and are incorporated by reference into the
contract. Refer to AFMCI 21-113 for additional guidance.
7.57. United Nations (UN)/Department of Transportation (DoT) Specification
Packaging. IAW AFI24-210_IP, Packaging of Hazardous Materials, tests are conducted to
ensure packaging meets prescribed UN/DoT protection standards for HAZMAT items in transit.
7.58. Urgent Justification Statement (UJS). UJSs document compelling circumstances for
accelerating technical requirements, such as engineering studies and other miscellaneous
services, through central procurement. Refer to Section 1.13 (Determining PI Priority) of this
policy for additional guidance.
7.59. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA). This agreement is executed with all
contractor operations located on USAF installations that will require contractor access to
 72                                                            AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


classified information. At the installation commander’s discretion, the VGSA execution
requirement may be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to
sensitive unclassified information, sensitive resources or frequent entry to the installation.
Address those security requirements and/or procedures that are unique to the installation for
which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs need only address those areas of
security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been covered elsewhere within the
contract. For additional information and guidelines, refer to DoD 5200.1-M, Acquisition Systems
Protection Program, and AFI 31-601.
7.60. Wage Determination Document (WDD). A list of minimum wage rates and fringe
benefits issued by the US Department of Labor based on wage survey data for a locality. When
contractually incorporated, a wage determination requires a contractor to pay service employees
no less than the specified wages and fringe benefits. Note: The wage determination document
may be referred to as a Skills Letter. Refer to FAR Part 22.1001, Application of Labor Laws to
Government Acquisitions - Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended – Definitions, and FAR
Part 52.222-42 for additional guidance.
7.61. Waiver for Qualification Requirements (WQR). Document that states why the source
should NOT have to meet the qualification requirements. Refer to FAR Part 9.2 for additional
guidance.
7.62. Warranty Application or Plan. Certain items or systems may be good candidates for
application of a warranty. When the responsible PM determines a warranty is appropriate, the

AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                     73


                                           Chapter 8

                                  GLOSSARY OF TERMS

8.1. Purpose: To provide definitions of some of the terms used in this instruction.
8.2. Acquisition Lead Time (AQLT). AQLT is a forecast of the likely future interval between
identifying a materiel requirement and receiving the associated procured materiel. Acquisition
lead time consists of two consecutive time periods: administrative lead time (ALT) and
production lead time (PLT). AFMCMAN 23-1 refers to AQLT as Procurement Lead Time
(PCLT). The DoD Components shall maintain a historical file of ALTs and PLTs for all item
procurements. AFMC IM/MMs record this data on an AFMC Form 318, Item Contracting
History Record. IM/MMs may exclude historical observations that will not impact future
performance. Exclusions may be based on the IM/MM's knowledge, experience, and judgment
or may result from an automated decision process.
   8.2.1. Innovative methods of pursuing minimum acquisition lead times should be employed.
   Particular emphasis should be given to the adoption, where applicable, of lead-time reduction
   methods such as multi-year contracting, "just-in-time" procedures, indefinite quantity
   requirements contracts, phased deliveries, and gradual reduction of vendor required delivery
   dates. Refer to DoD 4140-1-R, AFMCMANs 23-1 and 23-4 for more detail.
8.2.2. Impact of AQLT on Computed Requirements. All AFMC requirements computation
systems factor AQLT when calculating buy timing and/or quantity. This data resides in
requirements system data files various sources, including.
       8.2.2.1. System overlaid values received from the procurement tracking system based on
       current or completed contracts.
       8.2.2.2. System default values, when no other data exists.
       8.2.2.3. Values manually input by the IM/MM during file maintenance.
       8.2.2.4. The IM/MM must confirm the lead time values in the requirements system data
       files. The IM/MM will ensure realistic lead time values are maintained in the data files.
8.3. Acquisition Method Code (AMC)/Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC). Two
single digit codes, assigned by a DoD screening activity, to describe to the contracting officer
and other government personnel the results of a spare part’s technical review, suitability for
breakout or competitive sourcing (AMC) and provide engineering, manufacturing, and technical
information (AMSC). PCOs consider the AMC/AMSC when developing the method of
contracting, the list of sources to be solicited, the type of contract, etc. Refer to DFARS PGI
217.7506.
8.4. Administrative Lead Time (ALT). ALT begins when the requirements system calculates
a buy/repair requirement for an item or stand-alone requirement is initiated. ALT ends on the
date the contractual instrument is executed (contract award). ALT includes the time required to
identify the requirement; assemble the PI package, and route it through the logistics technical
review and approval process, funds certification, and finally contractual instrument
execution. Requirement owners use the ALT to ensure, at least in theory, PIs are initiated in
 74                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


time for the new stock to arrive just as the assets on hand reach the safety level. Refer to DoD
4140-1-R for more information.
   8.4.1. Contracting Lead Time (CLT). CLT is also a factor with the requirements
   acquisition process but is totally accounted for in ALT. CLT begins when the contracting
   agency accepts the PI and inputs the information into the procurement tracking system and
   ends when the contract is awarded. Contract lead time will be adjusted if the PR is put into
   rework or sits in an awaiting funds status.
   8.4.2. Purchase Request Lead Time (PRLT). PRLT is another ALT bucket of time
   exclusive to PRPS. PRLT begins when the PI RO builds the line item detail or a requirement
   in PRPS and ends when PRPS receives the contract award data.
8.5. Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS). Services provided under contract by non-
governmental sources to support or improve organizational policy development, decision-
making, management and administration, support program and/or project management and
administration, provide support services for research and development activities, provide
engineering and technical support services, or improve the effectiveness of management
processes or procedures. These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions,
alternatives, studies, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training and technical
support. A&AS consists of three major categories: engineering and technical services;
management and professional support services; and studies, analyses, and evaluations. Refer to
AFMCI 63-403 for guidance.
8.6. End Item. An end item is equipment that can perform a standalone military function.
Refer to AFMCI 63-1201 for additional guidance.
8.7. Federal Supply Classification (FSC). A four digit commodity classification designed to
serve the functions of supply to classify items of supply identified under the Federal Cataloging
Program. Groups and classes are grouped in respect to physical or performance characteristics,
or in respect to requisition or issuance grouping for supply management purposes. The primary
application of the FSC code number is in the NSN. The NSN for an item of supply consists of
the applicable four-digit FSC code number plus the nine-digit NIIN. For group and class
structure information refer to Federal Supply Classification Cataloging Handbook, H2.
8.8. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). This program facilitates sales of US arms, defense
equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign governments. FMS consist of
programmed or non-programmed requirements that support FMS customers. There are statutory
limitations on the obligation of the US Government's funds in support of non-US activity.
Therefore, the government cannot include projected or anticipated FMS requirement quantities
on a contract that expends funds.
8.9. Item Unique Identification (IUID). A system of marking items delivered to DoD with
unique item identifiers that have machine-readable data elements to distinguish an item from all
other like and unlike items. For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier, the
unique item identifier shall include the data elements of the enterprise identifier and a unique
serial number. The implementation of a standardized process of marking and identifying items is
changing from the linear bar code to a two-dimensional bar code. Refer to DFARS Subpart
211.274 for additional guidance.
AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013                                                                       75


8.10. Life-of-Type (LOT) Buy. A one-time procurement, when all cost-effective and prudent
alternatives have been exhausted, for the total future requirement of an item that is no longer
expected to be produced. The procurement quantity shall be based upon demand or engineering
estimates of mortality sufficient to support the applicable equipment until phased out.
8.11. Multiple Year Contract (MYC). A MYC is a one-year contract with option years
spanning up to a total of five years for an item that can be reasonably forecasted over several
years. Secondary items must also meet conditions prescribed in AFMCMAN 23-1. Even though
distinguished from a multi-year contract in the DFARS, 217.1, this publication includes this
contracting technique when it refers to multi-year contracting methods in general due to their
similar purpose and utility.
8.12. Multi-Year Contracts. Multi-year contracts are a contracting method that procures items
or services over more than one year, but not more than five years, without establishing options.
The total funds ultimately required to be obligated for subsequent years may not be available at
the time of contract award. Since MYCs should be considered as a contracting option along with
multi-year contracts, this publication infers MYCs are included whenever the term multi-year
contract is used generally. Ultimately the PCO determines the optimal contract type. Refre to
Far Subpart 17.1 for further guidance.
8.13. Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA). The PICA is the agency assigned
inventory control responsibility over a particular part, group of parts, system or commodity and
manages requirements for the entire DoD (usually the primary item/system user).
8.14. Production Lead Time (PLT). PLT begins on the date the contractual instrument is
awarded/executed. PLT ends when the materiel is received. When the contract provides for
incremental deliveries, confirmation of the first significant delivery (approximately 10% of the
routine contract requirement) terminates PLT. Refer to DoD 4140-1-R for more information.
8.15. Repair Method Code/Repair Method Suffix Code (RMC/RMSC). Two single digit
numeric codes, assigned by a contract repair screening activity, used in conjunction to provide
PCOs approved repair sources, determined and justified based on the availability and adequacy
of resources required to effect timely repair and high quality workmanship. The RMC identifies
engineering, manufacturing and technical data used in the repair process and the RMSC
represents the results of a technical review and denotes the method used in repairing the item.
Refer to AFMCI 21-149 for more detail.
8.16. Secondary Inventory Control Activities (SICA). A user of an item, system or
commodity assigned to a PICA.    The SICA provides requirements and has support
responsibilities to the PICA.
8.17. Strategic Contract. A contract is considered strategic if the contract is the outcome of a
detailed data-driven process that results in a sourcing solution that addresses supply chain
performance improvements and eLog21 goals. A strategic contract will provide coverage for
multiple NSN requirements over three years or more, be centrally managed and will have the
capability for decentralized ordering. Strategic contracts most often support recurring
requirements.
8.18. Tactical Contract. A contract is considered tactical if it does not meet the definition of a
strategic contract. These contracts most often fulfill individual materiel requirements for goods
and repair/services that are nonrecurring or when strategic contracts are not in place.
 76                                                              AFMCI20-102 11 JULY 2013


8.19. Technical Data Package (TDP). A technical data package describes an item adequately
enough to support an acquisition strategy. It defines the required design configuration and
procedures to ensure required item performance. It consists of all applicable technical data such
as drawings, associated lists, specifications, standards, performance requirements, QA
provisions, and packaging details.
