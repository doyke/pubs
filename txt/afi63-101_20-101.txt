                                            Chapter 1

                       INTEGRATED LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT

1.1. Purpose of AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM). This
instruction contains the directive overarching processes and procedures required for execution of
a program. Used in partnership with the non-directive best practices and procedures in AFPAM
63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, AF personnel can
efficiently implement the concepts of ILCM. ILCM is the seamless governance with transparent
processes that integrate all aspects of infrastructure, resource management, and business systems
necessary for successful development, acquisition, fielding, sustainment, decommission, and
disposal of systems, subsystems, end items, and services to satisfy validated warfighter
capability needs. This instruction must be used in conjunction with AFI 10-601, Operational
Capability Requirements Development, AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation,
and applicable 33-series documents to provide an integrated framework for the implementation
of ILCM.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to the management of all Acquisition Category
(ACAT) programs, designated weapon systems cited in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, and weapons systems, automated
information systems, and business systems in the operations and support (O&S) phase including
all product groups, systems, activities, services, and projects that support warfighter capability
planning and validated needs.
     1.2.1. Air Force acquisition programs utilizing investment funding to satisfy a validated need
     (i.e., Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and procurement) are ACAT
     programs or Technology Projects. ACAT III has no funding floor and encompasses all
     programs not included within ACAT I, IA, II, or identified as a Technology Project per DoDI
     5000.02.
     1.2.2. Due to their unique nature requiring additional security measures, Special Access
     Programs (SAPs) shall follow guidance regarding reporting, coordination, and use of
     specified tools, systems, and databases only as directed and as coordinated with Assistant
     Secretary of the AF (Acquisition) and Directorate of Special Programs (SAF/AQL) and
     approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).
     1.2.3. Science and technology activities are managed in accordance with AFPD 61-1,
     Management of Science and Technology.
     1.2.4. Regardless of Acquisition Category (ACAT), where there is a clear conflict between
     approved courses of action and where DoD policy/guidance does not allow for tailoring of
     process, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) (SAF/AQ) or Assistant Secretary
     of the Air Force (Installations, Environment, and Logistics) (SAF/IE) shall request waivers
     from the appropriate DoD office. Where the course of action, as approved and documented
     through the programmatic chain of authority, conflicts with an AFPD, the Program Manager
     (PM) shall submit a request for a waiver to the certifying authority for the publication, who
     will obtain Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) approval for the waiver if warranted. Where
     the course of action, as approved and documented through the programmatic chain of
     authority, conflicts with Air Force Departmental directive issuances other than AFPDs, the
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                9


   PM shall submit a notification via memorandum to the publication Office of Primary
   Responsibility (OPR) for action. The OPR shall take appropriate action to either provide
   direction to comply with policy, obtain a waiver to requirements, or to initiate changes to
   publications as appropriate to resolve the conflict in accordance with (IAW) AFI 33-360,
   Publications and Forms Management. Resolution of conflicts between Air Force issuances
   shall be resolved by the appropriate Headquarters Air Force (HAF) functional.
1.3. Integrated Life Cycle Framework. Figure 1.1 details the multi-functional collaborative
effort among the requirements, acquisition and sustainment, test, information operations, and
intelligence communities necessary for system life cycle management required for acquisition of
a system. Details on key acquisition and sustainment activities outlined in the framework can be
found in the body of this document and other supporting documentation. For more information
regarding requirements and test and evaluation reference AFI 10-601 and AFI 99-103. For more
information regarding information technology management and compliance refer to the
applicable 33-series documents describing IT acquisition and Chief Information Officer (CIO)
compliance requirements.

1.4. Integrated Life Cycle Management Chain of Authority. All Air Force (AF) programs
shall have a clear and unambiguous chain of authority. The management structure shall be
streamlined and characterized by short, clearly defined lines of responsibility, authority, and
accountability. Air Force acquisition management responsibility for all ACAT programs flows
from the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) to the Program Executive Officer (PEO) to the
accountable PM. In no case shall there be more than two levels of review between the PM and
the MDA in accordance with DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 5000.02, and AFPD 63-1/20-1.
Organizational leaders that are between or support the accountable PM and the MDA and/or
PEO need to stay informed, shall not hinder direct and open access, and shall not exercise
decision-making authority on programmatic matters.
   1.4.1. Program Execution Chain. The programmatic execution chain (acquisition chain of
   authority) shall be documented in the AS and in appropriate program strategy documents.
   All programs shall establish clear lines of program execution authority with documentation
   based on the guidance below.
       1.4.1.1. Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). The MDA, as defined in DoDI 5000.01,
       is the designated individual with overall responsibility for a program. The MDA shall
       have the authority to approve entry of a program into the next phase of the life cycle
       process, shall certify milestone (MS) criteria, and shall be accountable for cost, schedule,
       and performance reporting to higher authority, including Congressional reporting. MDA
       authority and delegation is defined in Table 1.1. For Acquisition of Services, decision
       authority delegations are in AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services.
          1.4.1.1.1. Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE). The DAE shall act as the MDA in
          accordance with the guidelines specified in DoDI 5000.02.
          1.4.1.1.2. Service Acquisition Executive (SAE). The SAE shall have overall
          authority and responsibility for the management of AF acquisition programs. MDA
          responsibilities are performed by the following:
              1.4.1.1.2.1. MDA responsibilities for ACAT IC, ACAT IAC, ACAT II, or special
              interest programs are conducted by the SAE. MDA responsibilities for ACAT II
              programs may be delegated to a PEO.
              1.4.1.1.2.2. MDA responsibilities for ACAT III programs are delegated to a PEO.
              PEOs may delegate ACAT III MDA responsibilities to an appropriately qualified
              Deputy PEO. Unless waived or specifically directed by the SAE, delegated
              MDAs shall comply with the PEO position requirements, and execute the same
              authorities and responsibilities of a MDA. PEOs shall notify the AFMC/CC or
              AFSPC/CC and the SAE of all such delegations. The SAE shall have the
              authority to rescind such delegations. No further delegation is allowed.

        accomplish objectives for the total life cycle of the program.
     1.4.1.4. Functional Program Support. The PM leads the program organization in
     executing the mission. Functional representatives within the program, irrespective of
     location or whether supporting the program on a full-time or part-time basis, shall take
     program direction from the PM for program related activities. The PM must identify the
     following principal functional support responsibilities: the Lead Systems Engineer (LSE),
     the Product Support Manager (PSM), and the Chief Developmental Tester (CDT)/Test
     Manager (TM). The PM will ensure that the LSE, PSM, and CDT/TM are working
     together to align the program’s strategies for systems engineering, product support, and
     test so they are mutually supportive, avoid duplication, and take advantage of available
     synergies. Other functional positions may be included at the PM’s discretion.
        1.4.1.4.1. PM Lead Systems Engineer (LSE). The PM LSE shall be assigned as soon
        as possible following the assignment of the PM. Note: In this AFI, the term “PM
        LSE” is not a duty title; the Air Force generally refers to the PM LSE as the Chief
        Engineer.

                                            Chapter 3

                         INTEGRATED LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES

3.1. Life Cycle Management Execution. The PM must assess and balance multiple processes
from this guidance and other DoD and HAF issuances. The PM shall ensure that DoD Directives
and Issuances take precedence over AF unique direction.
   3.1.1. All life cycle execution activities including assessments, processes, procedures, or
   direction which require resources and are not required by statutes, executive orders, DoD
   issuances, AF directive issuances, or previously approved through the programmatic chain of
   command, must add value to the mission. If the PM analysis indicates an activity does not
   add value, the PM can require the proponent to justify the activity and identify the resources
   (e.g., materiel, personnel, skills, training, and funding) for execution. The proponent may
   appeal a PM determination through the programmatic chain up to the MDA. The burden of
   proof lies with the proponent.
3.2. Tailoring. Tailoring provides the ability to integrate, consolidate, incorporate, and
streamline strategies, oversight, reviews, decision levels, documentation, and information. The
purpose is to streamline the acquisition program to the maximum extent possible, consistent with
risk, in order to deliver a capability most efficiently and effectively. MDAs shall promote
maximum flexibility in tailoring programs under their oversight to fit particular conditions of
that program, consistent with applicable laws and regulations and the time sensitivity of the
capability need. The MDA shall ensure that programs are tailored to 1) provide the needed
capability to the warfighter in the shortest practical time, 2) balance risk, 3) ensure affordability
and supportability, and 4) provide adequate information for decision making. Reference
AFPAM 63-128 for more information on tailoring.
   3.2.1. Tailoring shall be documented, including the supporting rationale and citation to the
   applicable statute or regulation. The PM shall identify the tailoring strategy in the
   Acquisition Strategy (AS) and/or Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) for the MDA’s
   approval.
   3.2.2. MDAs and PMs shall tailor within the scope of the applicable statute or regulation.
   MDAs shall have tailoring authority over all programmatic execution requirements except
   where stated in statute or regulation.
   3.2.3. MDAs shall not waive requirements when the waiver authority resides outside MDA
   authority. Waiver authority, other than those explicitly defined, belongs to the publication or
   requirement owner. A waiver is an expressed or written statement to relinquish or provide
   exceptions to specific statutory or regulatory requirement.
3.3. Capability Based Requirements Development. The operational community is responsible
for developing capability based requirements as defined in CJCSI 3170.01, Joint Capabilities
Integration and Development System, the JCIDS Manual, and AFI 10-601. For Defense
Business Systems (DBS), per DoDI 5000.02 guidance, an Investment Review Board (IRB)
approved Problem Statement is used in lieu of JCIDs documentation.
   3.3.1. For ACAT I, ACAT IA, and non-delegated ACAT II programs, the SAE and
   AFMC/CC or AFSPC/CC shall certify CDDs to the SECAF concurrent to document
 22                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   presentation to the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC). The certification
   shall certify:
       3.3.1.1. The CDD requirements can be clearly and unambiguously translated for
       evaluation in a source selection.
       3.3.1.2. The CDD capabilities are prioritized (if appropriate) and organized into feasible
       increments of capability. Feasible is defined as the requirements are technically
       achievable and executable within the estimated schedule and budgeted life cycle cost.
   3.3.2. For delegated ACAT II programs and below, AFMC/CC or AFSPC/CC shall attest
   that the capability requirements as described in all Capability Production Documents (CPDs)
   and delegated ACAT II and below CDDs are feasible. Attestation will be completed
   concurrent with document presentation to the AFROC.
3.4. Development Planning (DP). DP encompasses the engineering analysis and technical
planning activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the
fundamental path a materiel development will follow to meet operational needs effectively and
affordably. DP facilitates integrated capability development. Early planning, analysis, and
systems engineering activities provide linkages among operational needs, system performance
requirements, technology needs and opportunities, and potential life cycle costs, and establishes
a technical foundation for materiel development. As a result, requirements will be fiscally and
technologically informed; concepts will be mature and fiscally and technically feasible; and areas
for Science &Technology investment will be identified to reduce technology risks. AFI 10-601
and AFI 61-101, Management of Science and Technology, provide additional information.
3.5. Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Certifications. The MDA shall comply with all
program MS certification requirements as prescribed by statute or DoD policy including:
   3.5.1. MS A Certification. The MDA for an MDAP, without the authority to delegate, shall
   assess the program and sign a certification memorandum prior to MS A approval. The
   certification will be completed via a memorandum for record and will include the statements
   in 10 USC §2366a.
   3.5.2. MS B Certification. The MDA for an MDAP, without the authority to delegate, shall
   assess the program business case and sign a certification memorandum prior to MS B
   approval. The certification memorandum shall include the statements in 10 U.S.C. §2366b.
   If the program is initiated later than MS B a similar certification memorandum shall be
   prepared. The certification shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees with
   the first Selected Acquisition Report submitted after completion of the certification.
3.6. Air Force Review Boards (AFRB) and Acquisition Strategy Panels (ASP). AF Review
Boards/Acquisition Strategy Panels are integral to a deliberative process that supports AF
leadership in making MS decisions or conducting major decision reviews.
   3.6.1. Air Force Review Boards (AFRB).
       3.6.1.1. AFRBs are forums chaired by the SAE, or as delegated, for conducting major
       decision reviews (in- or out-of-cycle). AFRBs are not conducted for services.
       3.6.1.2. For ACAT ID and ACAT IAMs, AFRBs are used to develop the AF corporate
       consensus prior to an Office Secretary Defense (OSD) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB)
       (pre-DAB within AF) or Information Technology Acquisition Board (ITAB). The AFRB
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                              23


       should be conducted prior to OSD Integrating Integrated Product Team. The SAE, or as
       delegated, determines if an ACAT ID or ACAT IAM program requires an AFRB.
       3.6.1.3. The AFRB process is required for all ACAT IC, ACAT IAC, non-delegated
       ACAT II programs, and special interest programs. The PEO may recommend what type
       of AFRB is necessary: full, mini (tailored attendance), or paper. A template and more
       information can be found at the Acquisition functional page on the AF Portal in the
       Acquisition Excellence and Change Office section.
       3.6.1.4. PEOs shall execute a tailored review process for major decisions for delegated
       ACAT II and ACAT III programs.
   3.6.2. Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP).
       3.6.2.1. The Acquisition Strategy Panel supports the MDA. ASPs are forums that
       evaluate proposed acquisition strategies to ensure all key viable alternatives have been
       considered and that the best recommendation is provided to the program’s MDA for
       approval. Unless delegated in writing, the MDA is the ASP Chair, and is the sole
       authority to approve members of the panel. MDA delegations shall be done in
       accordance with the AFFARS.
       3.6.2.2. ASPs shall be held for all ACAT programs that are presenting a new strategy or
       a significant revision to an approved strategy. The Acquisition Strategy still requires
       approval by the MDA.
       3.6.2.3. Information concerning ASPs, such as the current draft template for briefings,
       can be found at the Acquisition functional page on the AF Portal in the Acquisition
       Excellence and Change Office section. Additionally, similar information pertaining to
       non-SAE chaired ASPs can be found by contacting the Field Acquisition Centers of
       Excellence.
3.7. Coordination of Requirements Document Used in Conjunction with Request for
Proposals (RFP). All acquisition programs will coordinate the requirements document used in
conjunction with a RFP with the requiring Lead Command prior to the release of the final RFP.
The level of coordination will be based on the program’s ACAT as follows: (NOTE: Lead
Command Commander may delegate Lead Command coordination no lower than one level
below designated level):
   3.7.1. ACAT I, IA – PEO to Lead Command Commander
   3.7.2. ACAT II – PEO to Lead Command Vice Commander
   3.7.3. ACAT III – PM to Lead Command Director of Requirements
   3.7.4. In addition to providing the Lead Command the requirements document for
   coordination, the PM shall provide any supporting documentation needed to aid in
   understanding the requirements traceability from the approved capability requirements
   document to the RFP.
   3.7.5. If the requirements document used in conjunction with the final RFP has previously
   been coordinated with the requiring Lead Command at the appropriate level, there is no need
   to re-accomplish coordination.

   3.7.6. A Systems Requirements Document (SRD) shall be used whenever warfighter/user
   capabilities and/or requirements must be translated into acquisition requirements for a new
   contract in support of a system/sub-system specification. For existing contracts, the guidance
   in MIL-HDBK-520 should be used whenever warfighter/user capabilities and/or
   requirements must be translated into acquisition requirements. For additional information on
   preparation of an SRD refer to MIL-HDBK-520, Systems Requirements Document Guidance.
   Guidance instructions in MIL-HDBK-520 are tailorable as required.
3.8. Request for Reclassification of Acquisition Programs Categorization. For
reclassification of an ACAT I or IA program to a lower ACAT, the SAE must submit requests to
USD(AT&L). The request shall identify the reasons for the reduction in ACAT level. The PM
shall notify the PEO and the SAE when it is necessary to raise the ACAT category from an
ACAT III or ACAT II to a higher level ACAT category. This notification shall be made
immediately upon determining that the program meets the requirements of the higher category as
defined in DoDI 5000.02. If the program qualifies as an ACAT I program, the program is
assumed to be an ACAT ID or IAM until the SAE requests and the USD(AT&L) agrees to
categorize the program as an ACAT IC or ACAT IAC. USD(AT&L) has the authority to
reclassify an acquisition program as an ACAT ID or IAM at any time.
3.9. Air Force Acquisition Master List (AML).
   3.9.1. Acquisition Master List (AML). The AML is the AF master list of all programs as

       components of the program on the AML.
   3.9.2. Each system development, upgrade, or modification with a separate acquisition
   program baseline that meets the AML criteria shall be listed separately on the AML;
   however, activities that share an acquisition program baseline or recurring activities (e.g.
   Low Cost Modifications, Service Bulletins) may be combined into a single effort on the
   AML.
   3.9.3. Inclusion on the AML does not constitute program new start approval and does not
   constitute authority to commit, obligate, or expend funds.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                25

   not are required to conduct an appropriate level of reporting as defined in Chapter 10 of this
   AFI.
3.10. Risk-Based Program Management and Decision Making. PMs on all programs,
including commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and non-developmental item (NDI) programs must
assess and mitigate risks of all kinds as a routine part of program management and must clearly
identify risk during program reviews. Active Risk Manager (ARM) is the current standard tool to
manage program risks. Refer to The Risk Management Guide for DoD Acquisition and AFPAM
63-128 for more information.
   3.10.1. Programmatic Risk. The PM shall pursue a comprehensive integrated risk analysis
   throughout the life cycle and shall prepare and maintain a risk management plan.
   Methodologies used to manage risk shall include Risk Management Plans (RMP), program
   risk reviews, risk-based source selection, technical risk management, safety risk
   management, and the DoD Standard Practice for System Safety prescribed in MIL STD 882.
   3.10.2. Risk-based Source Selection. The source selection approach, as part of the
   acquisition strategy, shall be developed to reduce risk over the life cycle of the program.
   This includes identifying the strengths, weaknesses, domain experience, process capability,
   development capacity, and past performance for all developer team members with significant
   development responsibilities. This should inform key technical and appropriate program
   risks and the formulation of source selection evaluation criteria. Source selection guidance
   and procedures are contained in FAR Part 15, DFARS Part 215, AFFARS 5315.3 and
   AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5315.3.
   3.10.3. Schedule Risk Management. The PM shall have execution responsibility for
   schedule risk management and shall utilize appropriate tools to develop, guide, and manage
   associated risks. Schedule risk includes schedule slips due to manufacturing issues,
   contracting and subcontracting issues, testing, government rules/impediments, uncertainty in
   work, unrealistic schedules, natural causes, and complexity. All programs will maintain an
26                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


  Integrated Master Schedule and review it frequently including analyzing a program’s
  “critical path” in order to determine and manage potential risks associated with schedule
  slips.
  3.10.4. Cost Risk Management. The PM shall have responsibility shall adjust program
  decisions based on potential cost variation and cost uncertainties. Uncertainty feeding the
  overall programs' costs will be identified from the risks and risk mitigation activities
  associated with prediction of future costs based on current knowledge of technical, schedule
  and market analysis. Uncertainty in the program is the risk associated with the ability of the
  program to achieve its life cycle cost objectives. A program’s cost estimator has the
  responsibility for supporting the PM’s integrated cost risk management efforts, utilizing
  methods and cost management principles outlined in AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics, and
  AFI 65-508, Cost Analysis Guidance and Procedures.
  3.10.5. Technical Risk Management. The PM has execution responsibility for technical risk
  management, and shall utilize systems engineering throughout the life cycle to manage
  program technical risks. Technical risk management includes risk based prototype planning
  and development. Technical risk management shall consider technology maturity, cyber and
  information assurance risks, interoperability and supportability, testing risks, and security
  threats to mission critical functionality and critical program information.
  3.10.6. Product Support Risk Management. The PM has execution responsibility for product
  support risk management, and utilizes applicable logistics assessment tools throughout the
  life cycle to manage program product support risks. The Life Cycle Guide and Checklist,
  Logistics Health Assessment, and Logistics Assessment (LA) are product support/logistics
  life cycle tools that can be used by PSMs to identify, track, and mitigate product support
  risks.
  3.10.7. Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) Risk Management. The PM
  shall use MIL-STD-882 and AFPD 90-8, Environment, Safety & Occupational Health
  Management and Risk Management, to manage ESOH risks as part of SE process in all
  developmental and sustaining engineering activities. The PM shall report the status of
  applicable ESOH requirements at program and technical reviews.
     3.10.7.1. Formal ESOH Risk Acceptance. The PM shall document that the associated
     risks have been accepted by the following acceptance authorities: the SAE for high risks,
     PEO-level for serious risks, and the PM for medium and low risks prior to exposing
     people, equipment, or the environment to known system-related ESOH hazards. Formal
     risk acceptance requirements apply throughout the life of the system.
         3.10.7.1.1. The user representative shall be part of the ESOH risk acceptance process
         throughout the life cycle and shall provide formal concurrence prior to all serious-
         and high-risk acceptance decisions.
         3.10.7.1.2. High risk acceptance packages shall be coordinated with the user
         representative and Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) before submission to the SAE
         for acceptance.
         3.10.7.1.3. The PM shall ensure each high and serious risk acceptance package
         describes the hazard, predicted risk consequence and probability, available mitigation
         measures, costs or other limitations to mitigation implementation, proposed
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                               27


         mitigation measures, target risk after implementation of proposed mitigation, the
         proposed acceptance period, and an assessment of the expected losses for the period
         of acceptance.
         3.10.7.1.4. The period of a risk acceptance should be either the remaining life of the
         system if no mitigations are proposed, or the period for implementation of the
         proposed mitigation(s) throughout the entire fleet plus sufficient time to validate the
         effectiveness of the implemented mitigation(s).
         3.10.7.1.5. The risk assessments that support high risk acceptance packages must
         conform to the guidance in MIL-STD-882 and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
         Prevention Program.
     3.10.7.2. The PM shall track ESOH hazards including identified hazardous materials
     either imbedded in the system or used for system operations and maintenance; the PM
     will also provide additional information on the locations, amounts, disposal requirements,
     and special training requirements for the hazardous materials. PMs developing or
     sustaining aircraft will provide this information to the Air Force Civil Engineer Support
     Agency (AFCESA) responsible for including these data in Technical Order (TO) 00-
     105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency
     Services).The PM shall provide a safety release for the system prior to each
     developmental and operational test involving personnel. The safety release must identify
     the hazards involved in the test and their formal risk acceptance. This is also a part of
     T&E risk management.
     3.10.7.3. The PM shall provide system-specific ESOH hazard and risk analyses and data
     to support using commands’ and T&E organizations’ National Environmental Policy
     Act/Environmental Impact Analysis Process (NEPA/EIAP) and E.O. 12114,
     Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, documentation requirements.
     The SAE is the final approval authority for system-related NEPA documentation.
     3.10.7.4. The PM shall work with Air Force Safety Center to provide the inputs required
     by DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping,
     Enclosure 4, paragraph 3.b.(9) as part of mishap investigations of all Class A and B
     mishaps involving their systems. The PM shall provide analyses of the ESOH hazards
     that may have contributed to the mishap under investigation, and make recommendations
     for resulting materiel risk mitigations measures, especially those designed to minimize
     the potential for human error.
  3.10.8. T&E Risk Management. The PM has execution responsibility for T&E risk
  management, and shall utilize both system engineering and T&E processes throughout the
  life cycle to manage program T&E risks. T&E risk management shall consider test
  resources, test schedule, certifications, and technical risks (to include the PM’s safety
  release) from a T&E perspective. Refer to AFI 99-103 for more information on T&E
  processes.
  3.10.9. Operational Risk Management. The PM shall assist the system testers, operators,
  and maintainers in the application of risk management by providing the assessment of
  hazards and potential mitigation measures. Refer to AFI 90-802, Risk Management, for more

3.11. Program Integration. Program integration provides the Air Force with consistent
insightful and synchronized recommendations, improved data reporting and analysis, and
maximized utilization of resources. Its objectives are twofold: strengthen decision-making and
harmonize the information across Air Force Acquisition leadership. It is a responsibility of the
PM to demonstrate and document how they integrate cost, schedule and performance
information and analysis into program decisions, but successful program integration requires
involvement of each functional expert within the program office to provide guidance and
recommendation. Program Integration is supported by Earned Value Management (EVM),
Integrated Master Plans (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedules (IMS), Performance
Measurement Baseline (PMB) Analysis, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), document and
process/information control, program management reviews, and other activities.
3.12. Earned Value Management (EVM)/EVM System (EVMS). As defined by the Defense
Acquisition Guidebook (DAG), EVM is a key integrating process in the management and
oversight of acquisition programs including information technology programs. The qualities and
operating characteristics of the EVMS are described in American National Standards
Institute/Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard–748. The Defense Contract
Management Agency (DCMA) is responsible for EVMS compliance and for ensuring the
integrity and application effectiveness of the contractor’s EVMS.
   3.12.1. EVM/EVMS applicability shall be based on the type of contract and the dollar
   threshold in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.2 (EVMS) and DoDI 5000.02 unless a
   waiver is obtained from the MDA.
       3.12.1.1. Request for tailoring/waiving EVM/EVMS requirements for MDAPs shall be
       coordinated with SAF/AQX who will coordinate with Program Assessment Root Cause
       Analysis (PARCA) EVM Division.
       3.12.1.2. EVM applicability with reference to authorizing documents (regulations/
       policies/instructions), waivers, and business case/cost benefit analysis (if applicable) shall
       be included in program acquisition strategy documents and the program acquisition plan
       submitted to the MDA.
   3.12.2. Where EVMS is required, the PM/PEO shall ensure that:
       3.12.2.1. The contract will contain the DFAR clauses IAW DFARS 252.234-7001 and
       252.234-7002 (EVM clauses) and DFARS clause 252.242-7005 (Contractor Business
       Systems).
       3.12.2.2. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is IAW MIL-STD-881.
       3.12.2.3. The Integrated Master Plan (IMP) is IAW the latest version of the DOD
       IMP/IMS Preparation and Use Guide.
       3.12.2.4. EVM reporting is IAW DODI 5000.02. Integrated Program Management
       Report (IPMR) and Contract Funds Status Report (CFSR), which include reconciliation
       between IPMR and CFSR, are required IAW latest version of the Data Item Description.
       3.12.2.5. Integrated Baseline Reviews (IBRs) will be conducted as required by the DODI
       5000.02 and DFARS clause 252.234-7002.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                29


   3.12.3. EVM shall integrate the cost, schedule, and technical requirements of the program
   and link them with the project's risk management process. The PM shall perform the
   following EVM analysis and reporting:
       3.12.3.1. Validate compliance of IPMR (or Contract Performance Report on older
       contracts) and CFSR, with contractual Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)
       requirements. For contracts requiring submission to the OSD EVM Central Repository
       (EVM-CR), acceptance/rejection of each document shall be in accordance with EVM-CR
       requirements.
       3.12.3.2. EVM performance analysis (cost/schedule variance, indices, schedule margins,
       critical/near critical path, risks, Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) integrity,
       etc.) to ensure continuing progress and program realism. Based on this analysis, the PM
       shall develop a risk based independent Estimate at Completion (EAC).
       3.12.3.3. Prior month level-one EVM data along with the PM’s independent EAC for
       each contract shall be reported in SMART for inclusion in the Monthly Acquisition
       Report (MAR).
   3.12.4. EVM Requirements for Over Target Baselines (OTB)/Over Target Schedules (OTS).
       3.12.4.1. An OTB is defined as an EVM baseline that exceeds contract value. An OTS is
       defined as a schedule that exceeds the contractually required delivery dates.
       3.12.4.2. SAF/AQ shall be notified through the MAR of any OTB/OTS: (1) prior to
       implementation, and (2) upon completion.
       3.12.4.3. Contractor EVM reporting may not be waived while implementing an over-
       target baseline, unless otherwise agreed to by SAF/AQX. At a minimum, Actual Cost
       Work Performed (ACWP) shall be reported in Format 1 during the hiatus.
       3.12.4.4. Programs implementing an OTB/OTS will conduct a subsequent Integrated
       Baseline Review (IBR) on the revised baseline if not conducted during the OTB/OTS.
   3.12.5. Single Point Adjustment (SPA). SPA refers to eliminating cumulative performance
   variances (setting cost and/or schedule variances to zero). SPAs shall not be performed
   solely to improve contract performance metrics. Therefore a SPA by setting cost variances
   to zero will not be permitted without the execution of an OTB formal reprogramming action
   or PEO authorization with coordination by SAF/AQX.
3.13. Integrated Master Plans (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedules (IMS). The PM
shall develop and maintain the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedule
(IMS). Both IMP and IMS integrate all program activities and schedules into a single sight
picture. This includes integrated master schedules from all contractors, as well as government
activities to include test plans and depot activation. Refer to the DAG and the DOD IMP/IMS
Preparation and Use Guide for additional information.
3.14. Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) Analysis. The PM shall perform cost,
schedule, and risk analysis of the contractors’ PMB to assure continuing progress and program
realism. The PMB should contain sufficient detail, account for all scope, and reflect accurate
schedules. The PMB must be reviewed to assess implementation of the contractor’s earned
value system via the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process. The IBR is a continuous,
iterative process throughout the life of the effort to ensure continued realism of the integrated
 30                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


PMB. Disciplined and comprehensive reviews of the IMP, IMS, and PMB are essential to avoid
surprises and miscommunication.
3.15. Program Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The PM shall develop a Program Work
Breakdown Structure (WBS) (detailed guidance on the work breakdown structures for defense
materiel items is located in MIL-STD-881).
3.16. Selection of Contractors for Subsystems and Components. PMs shall determine the
approach to establish and maintain access to competitive suppliers for critical areas at the
system, subsystem, and component level and document in appropriate program documentation.
3.17. Procurement Fraud. The PM shall immediately notify the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations, Deputy General Counsel for Contractor Responsibility (SAF/GCR), and the
AFLOA Fraud Branch of any actual or suspected procurement fraud. Reference AFI 51-1101,
The Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program for more information.
3.18. Program Funding. Authority is delegated to SAF/AQX, to direct the implementation of
programs in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation; Aircraft; Missile; Ammunition;
and Other Procurement appropriations. SAF/AQX direction is provided through Program
Authorization (PA) documents which request formal allocation of resources to modernization
programs and subprograms.
   3.18.1. Programs will submit requests for PA adjustments (via the associated AQ Capability
   Directorate) when authorizations are inconsistent with program requirements, or when
   necessary to meet critical requirements. SAF/AQX authorizes, via issuance of PA
   documents, execution-year adjustments to program funding, to include release/withdrawal of
   funds, and subprogram level funding realignments.
   3.18.2. SAF/AQX will coordinate on all investment New Start actions, Below Threshold
   Reprogramming (BTR), and Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) actions, prior to
   submittal to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management) (SAF/FM) and
   Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Legislative Liaison) (SAF/LL).
3.19. New Start Notification. A New Start is any program, subprogram, modification, project,
or subproject not previously justified to and funded by Congress in a given appropriation through
the normal budget process. When a determination has been made that the efforts undertaken
meet the New Start criteria, Congress must be notified via either a Letter of Notification or
DD1415-1 (Prior Approval Reprogramming Action). The methods of notification to be used are
delineated in AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Volume I and DoD 7000.14-R,
Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (FMR), Volume III Chapter 6.
Additional guidance on new start business rules can be provided by SAF/FMBI.
   3.19.1. New Start Validation Responsibilities. The PM, along with the respective Program
   Office Chief Financial Officer, is required to document and validate that efforts underway
   have obtained approval for new start or have been adequately assessed and determined not to
   meet the new start criteria before any funds are obligated for programs not categorized as
   “commodity” programs. Pre-contract cost agreements are subject to new start criteria and
   require completion of the validation form. RFPs, proposal evaluations, and contract
   negotiations are part of normal Program Office activities and therefore, do not represent new
   start activities.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                   31

       Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume III Chapter 6 for additional guidance
       on the key points delineated in the Validation Form in AFPAM 63-128. If no item in the
       Validation Form is marked YES, then the PM shall work with the respective Program
       Element Monitor (PEM) and/or Capability Director (CD) at the HAF to coordinate the
       initiation of the appropriate New Start Notification package (i.e., Letter of
       Notification/1415-1 Packages). Once the Validation Form is completed it shall be filed
       as part of the program’s contract file.
   3.19.2. Validation Form Exemptions. Funding actions for the following are excluded from
   the requirement to complete the validation form prior to obligating funds. The exemption
   from completing the validation form does not absolve activities from complying with all
   regulations pertaining to New Start Notifications in the event that a New Start is planned for
   initiation.
       3.19.2.1. All Basic Research (6.1), Applied Research (6.2), and Advanced Technology

   government.
   3.21.3. For the termination plan and ADM templates, reference AFPAM 63-128.
3.22. Materiel Fielding. Materiel fielding is the process by which AF systems and equipment
are delivered to and put into service by operational units in the field.
   3.22.1. The PM shall develop and maintain a Materiel Fielding Plan (MFP) from MS B
   through the production and deployment phase. The PM shall coordinate the MFP with the
   lead/using command(s) and other stakeholder organizations that will interface with, or
   provide support (e.g. training) for the materiel being developed. At the PM’s discretion, the
   MFP may be a stand-alone document, an annex to the program AS or Life Cycle Sustainment
   Plan (LCSP), or embedded within the AS or LCSP itself.
   3.22.2. At MS C and all subsequent production decision reviews, the PM shall update the
   MFP as necessary to reflect the materiel fielding-related requirements specified in the user‘s
   CPD, or any changes in the user‘s system/product delivery and acceptance criteria, the user‘s
   operational/mission employment and the user‘s requirements to support operator and
   maintenance training (e.g. Required Assets Available), Initial Operational Capability (IOC),
   and Full Operational Capability (FOC). The PM should address levels of maintenance,
   sources of repair, sustainment partnering relationships, source of supply, support equipment,
   and use of interim contractor support and/or contractor logistics.
   3.22.3. Consult AFPAM 63-128 for additional guidance and information related to the
   materiel fielding process.
3.23. Program Realignment. Program realignment, to include transfer of program
management responsibilities, is the process by which AF systems and acquisition programs are
formally realigned between geographically separate locations. Management authorities and
responsibilities execute through the PEO regardless of program location. The PEO shall
thoroughly coordinate the transition requirements, activities, and timeframes associated with
realignment. The overall objective of this process is to ensure a seamless and transparent (to the
user) transition of the system or program.
   3.23.1. Program Transition Requirements. The PM and associated workload for systems and
   acquisition programs should not be realigned unless, at a minimum, the system, subsystem,
   component, or increment of capability has been certified as interoperable within its intended
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                  33


   operational environment, has achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Rate
   Production (FRP), is logistically supportable per the user‘s requirement, and can align the
   program office responsibilities to co-locate with the organization(s) responsible for the
   system’s/program’s depot maintenance and supply chain management.                Executive
   management responsibilities for acquisition programs shall remain with the PEO.
   3.23.2. Program Realignment Process. The program realignment process is a collaborative
   activity that is executed by the PM. PMs may initiate planning for program realignment at
   any point in the acquisition process, but must establish and document the initial target
   transition date in the AS no later than MS C or as determined by the MDA. As part of this
   planning activity, the PM shall determine and coordinate program transition requirements
   and timelines based on the criteria outlined in the previous paragraph, and the program
   realignment planning criteria and considerations described in AFPAM 63-128. As the
   planning effort unfolds, the PM shall brief their transition plans, requirements, risks and risk
   mitigation plans, and associated timelines during applicable milestone and
   production/deployment decision reviews, and during other program/portfolio reviews as
   necessary to inform senior system/program management executives and resolve realignment-
   related issues.
   3.23.3. Transition Support Plans (TSP). All program realignments shall be conducted in
   accordance with a TSP that is prepared by the PM. The PEO and center commander(s) shall
   be signatories on the TSP. The AFMC/CC or AFSPC/CC shall be the final signatory on the
   TSP prior to forwarding the plan to SAF/AQ for signature. The PM shall target completion of
   the TSP no later than three years prior to the target realignment date. Once the TSP is
   approved, the PM shall update the program documentation as necessary to reflect the actions,
   timelines, and responsibilities specified in the TSP. The TSP will be maintained until the
   program realignment is completed, or a determination is made to terminate the proposed
   program realignment.
   3.23.4. The PM shall provide TSP status to AFMC or AFSPC as requested and shall
   coordinate changes impacting the realignment date/TSP with the MDA and notify AFMC or
   AFSPC of approved changes.
   3.23.5. Consult the Program Realignment Guide chapter in AFPAM 63-128 for additional
   guidance and information related to the PM and program realignment process. This pamphlet
   provides detailed planning criteria and considerations that PMs can use to develop,
   coordinate, and implement TSPs.
3.24. Post Implementation Review (PIR). The PIR evaluates the project's benefit-cost and risk
analyses and the projected benefits to mission accomplishment and the performance measures for
comparing expected versus actual results. A draft PIR plan is developed and then submitted to
the CIO at MS B. The plan for conducting a PIR is reviewed and approved at the Full Rate
Production Decision Review or Full Deployment Decision Review. The actual PIR is conducted
and a report is generated after Initial Operational Capability and generally before Full
Operational Capability. The Lead Command/Sponsor is responsible for planning the PIR,
gathering data, analyzing the data, and assessing the results. The PM is responsible for
supporting the Lead Command/Sponsor with respect to execution and reporting of the PIR. For
more information, refer to AFMAN 33-407, Air Force Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance
Guide and the Defense Acquisition Guidebook.

3.25. Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). The QRC approach is a highly tailored acquisition
process, geared to provide rapid acquisition solutions to urgent needs. PMs and lead commands
shall use the QRC process for addressing Urgent Operational Needs, Joint Urgent Operational
Needs, and Top-Down Direction. For more information refer to AFI 63-114, Quick Reaction
Capability Process, CJCSI 3170.01, and AFI 10-601.
3.26. Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Program (WRAP). WRAP exists to accelerate the
development, thus subsequent fielding, of operational initiatives resulting from innovation.
Specifically, it offers RDT&E (3600) money to promising operational initiatives so that they
may begin formal development activities during the current fiscal year, rather than waiting for
Program Objective Memorandum (POM) funds which may not be available for 18 to 24 months.
Guidance on the WRAP process can be found in AFPAM 63-128.
3.27. Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD). The JCTD process is a pre-
acquisition activity, spanning from two to three years. It provides the user an opportunity to
assess innovative technologically mature capabilities and determine their military utility before
deciding to acquire additional units or incorporate new technology. The concept falls between
the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) “urgent needs” process of fewer than two years with
little or no development and the traditional, more deliberate, formal acquisition process described
in this AFI. JCTDs focus on four areas: Joint, Transformational, Coalition, and Inter-agency
capabilities. More information can be found in CJCSI 3170.01, the JCIDS Manual, AFI 10-601,
and at the JCTD webpage.
3.28. Missile Defense Agency Related Acquisition. Life cycle management support shall be
provided to the Director, Missile Defense Agency, as required, to carry out the responsibilities
and functions assigned to the Missile Defense Agency in accordance with DoDD 5134.09,
Missile Defense Agency (MDA). Where the Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency have
agreed through a weapon-specific memorandum of understanding that the AF will be responsible
for the life cycle management of an element of the ballistic missile defense system in accordance
with the Deputy Secretary of Defense guidance on BMDS funding responsibility, the Air Force
shall follow the DoD 5000-series publications and this instruction.
3.29. Nuclear Weapon Related Policy. Air Force Nuclear Weapon related acquisitions shall
be developed IAW DoDD 5000.01 and DoDI 5000.02.
   3.29.1. Joint Air Force-National Nuclear Security Administration developed nuclear
   weapons will be accomplished in accordance with DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 5000.02 as directed
   in DoDD 3150.1, Joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapon Life-Cycle Activities, DoDI 5030.55,
   DoD Procedures For Joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life-Cycle Activities, and AFI 63-
   103, Joint Air Force-National Nuclear Security Administration (AF-NNSA) Nuclear
   Weapons Life Cycle Management.
   3.29.2. Additional Air Force nuclear weapon related policy may be found in AFI 16-601,
   Implementation of, and Compliance With, International Arms Control and Non-Proliferation
   Agreements, AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management, AFI 21-204,
   Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures, AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE Program, AFI

   3.29.3. Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel (NWRM). The PM shall ensure parts are
   evaluated against NWRM criteria in AFI 20-110. If assets are deemed NWRM, the PM will
   implement applicable actions in compliance with AFI 20-110.
3.30. Independent Reviews. The PEO and Implementing Command/CCs, with SAF/AQ
coordination, may conduct independent reviews of programs and other acquisition activities to
gain insight to improve the acquisition and sustainment of weapons systems. These reviews
shall include recommendations with the intent to identify and address systematic problems in
process, training, or organizations.

                          PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Program Documentation. The PM is responsible for completing and coordinating all
applicable program documentation as required by statute and policy.
   4.1.1. All new AF programs and existing programs requiring Office of the Secretary of
   Defense (OSD) oversight shall prepare documentation consistent with OSD approved
   templates. For other existing programs, the MDA will make the determination how to
   capture the information requirements dictated by the OSD templates. Regardless of the
   format used to document the results, PMs are responsible for ensuring that the content of the
   plans meets all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Refer to the DAG for
   information on the OSD templates.
   4.1.2. The PM shall ensure that program documentation is streamlined to ensure applicable
   program information is presented and coordinated efficiently. The PM shall consolidate
   information requirements and tailor documentation as approved by the MDA and consistent
   with statute and regulations. The PM shall identify tailoring of the documentation in the AS
   and/or ADM. The MDA has tailoring authority over documentation where the MDA holds
   approval authority, except where stated in regulation or statute.
      4.1.2.1. Document approval authority is detailed in Table 4.1 for ACAT IC, IAC, II, and
      III programs. Table 4.1 details the organizations required to approve the document per
      statute and regulation not coordination of the document.
      4.1.2.2. ACAT ID and ACAT IAM programs shall follow OSD guidelines concerning
      approval authority.
      4.1.2.3. When the SAE is the MDA, the SAF/AQ military or principal deputy shall have
      signature authority for MDA approved documentation. This applies to all documentation
      with the exception of the AS, ADM, and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).
   4.1.3. Documentation shall be coordinated with all organizations that will be required to
   support the implementation of the plan.
   4.1.4. Reviewing offices need to expedite coordination within the time specified by the
   MDA/PM and either “concur” or “non-concur.” Concurrence and coordination by all parties
   involved may not be necessary for an MDA to make a decision. However, staff packages
   should reflect the “non-concur” and stated reasons so the MDA can make a fully informed
   decision. Format driven changes should not result in delaying the coordination process. PMs,
   reviewing offices, and staffs shall use automated tools, as available, to streamline
   coordination and approval. The PM shall ensure program documentation is maintained and
   made available electronically, as applicable.
   4.1.5. The Acquisition Document Development and Management (ADDM) tool contains
   templates for acquisition documentation.

4.2. PEO Portfolio Assignment.
     4.2.1. Upon validation of a requirements document, the sponsor shall inform SAF/AQ of the
     potential program. Information provided shall contain proposed program description,
     estimated dollar value, funding status, and anticipated ACAT. With input from AFMC or
     AFSPC, SAF/AQ shall assign the effort to a PEO and include confirmation of proposed
     ACAT level and MDA authority.
 38                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   4.2.2. For legacy systems or systems transitioning from another agency, the sponsor shall
   provide the program description, estimated dollar value, and funding status to SAF/AQ for
   assessment. Upon acceptance and with input from AFMC or AFSPC, SAF/AQ shall assign
   the effort to a PEO and determine MDA authority.
   4.2.3. Transfer of programs between PEO portfolios shall be coordinated through AFMC or
   AFSPC (as appropriate) and approved by SAF/AQ. The impacted organizations shall prepare
   a joint request providing rationale and justification for the proposed transfer.
   4.2.4. Send PEO Assignment requests to the SAF/AQXRR Workflow.
4.3. Materiel Development Decision (MDD). All potential programs proceed through an
MDD review when entering the acquisition life cycle framework. The MDD review is the
formal entry into the acquisition process. MDD reviews will be conducted using the established
Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), Information Technology Acquisition Board (ITAB), Air
Force Review Board (AFRB), or a PEO tailored AFRB processes for ACAT III programs. The
MDD review shall ensure that a complete analysis/assessment of alternatives and their non-
materiel implications will be or has been conducted. An MDA decision to begin Materiel
Solution Analysis DOES NOT mean that a new acquisition program has been initiated.
   4.3.1. MDD Authority. The MDA chairs and approves all MDD decisions.
   4.3.2. MDD Requirements. At a minimum, conducting an MDD is dependent upon a Joint
   Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/AFROC approved ICD, approved 1067, or an IRB
   approved Problem Statement, and the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation
   (DCAPE), AF/A5R, or Lead MAJCOM being prepared to present the Analysis of
   Alternatives (AoA) Study Guidance and AoA Study Plan or alternative analysis/supporting
   analysis guidance for MDA approval.
   4.3.3. MDD. The MDA shall:
       4.3.3.1. Determine if additional information is required.
       4.3.3.2. Review AoA Study Guidance and AoA Study Plan or alternative analysis /
       supporting analysis guidance.
       4.3.3.3. Approve recommended acquisition phase of entry and phase-specific entrance
       criteria for next program MS.
       4.3.3.4. Designate lead acquisition organization. NOTE: If DAE is MDA, designation is
       of lead DoD Component.
       4.3.3.5. Make decision to begin Materiel Solution Analysis Phase (or other acquisition
       phase based on appropriate justification).
       4.3.3.6. Approve resource strategy for post MDD phase of effort.
   4.3.4. MDD Outcome.
       4.3.4.1. Document the decisions of the MDD in an ADM (e.g., phase of entry with
       phase-specific exit criteria for next program MS, AoA Study Guidance and AoA Study
       Plan approval, AF organization, termination or temporary suspension of the effort).
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                 39


       4.3.4.2. Provide ADM and AoA Study Guidance and AoA Study Plan or alternative
       analysis/supporting analysis guidance to lead DoD Component/appropriate Capability
       Director.
4.4. The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). The ADM documents the results of the
MDD and every MS decision. The ADM will document descriptions of the responsibilities of
each organization, the funding source, and the actions necessary to prepare for the next MS
decision. The ADM is also used to document MDA decisions not specifically milestone
decisions such as the Development RFP Release decision and formal acceptance of moderate and
high residual risks. The MDA signs the ADM. A copy of ACAT I or non-delegated ACAT II
ADMs shall be provided to HQ AFMC or HQ AFSPC.
4.5. DELETED
   4.5.1. DELETED.
   4.5.2. DELETED.
   4.5.3. DELETED.
4.6. Acquisition Strategy (AS). The AS is the overall life cycle strategy for the system. The
PM shall develop an AS that documents the life cycle strategies necessary to satisfy statutory and
regulatory requirements under DoDI 5000.02. For more information refer to AFPAM 63-128.
   4.6.1. An AS is required for all acquisition programs.
   4.6.2. For all ACAT levels the MDA is the approval authority for the AS.
   4.6.3. The AS is initially required for MS A. The AS shall be updated and approved at each
   subsequent MS decision point or whenever there is a significant change (e.g., change in
   contract type, change in quantities).
   4.6.4. The MDA shall approve the AS prior to the release of a formal solicitation.
   4.6.5. The PM shall ensure the AS is documented in sufficient detail to ensure that it meets
   the information requirements of the OSD approved AS template.
   4.6.6. At the discretion of the MDA, the AS for a modification may be an annex to the
   existing and approved system AS.
   4.6.7. Fact-of-life changes, such as updates to schedule and funding adjustments, do not
   require a re-coordination of the AS unless they drive a significant change in the approved
   strategies or APB.
   4.6.8. Existing programs that do not currently have an AS shall transition to an AS when the
   program:
       4.6.8.1. Enters a new milestone, or
       4.6.8.2. Implements a major system modification. At the discretion of the approval
       authority, the requirement may be met with an annex to the existing system approved
       acquisition/sustainment strategy documentation. The annex will be completed in
       accordance with all AS requirements.
   4.6.9. For AF programs delegated to the SAE and below, that have an approved Life Cycle
   Management Plan (LCMP) (as of the publishing date of this instruction), the MDA may
 40                                                      AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   approve the continued use of the LCMP for the life of the program. The PM shall ensure that
   the LCMP meets the information and coordination requirements of the OSD AS and LCSP
   templates. Programs are not required to have a standalone AS and LCSP with an approved
   LCMP meeting the conditions of this paragraph.
4.7. Acquisition Program Baseline (APB). The PM shall ensure each program or increment
has an APB establishing program goals—thresholds and objectives—for the minimum number
of cost, schedule, supportability, and performance parameters that describe the program over its
life cycle. Reference 10 USC §2433 and 10 USC §2435.
   4.7.1. The original APB shall be prepared prior to the program entering EMD or program
   initiation whichever occurs later. The APB shall be reviewed at each subsequent MS
   decision and full rate production to determine if updates/changes are required. The APB
   shall be updated at significant or critical Nunn-McCurdy cost breaches or at MAIS Critical
   Changes. The APB shall be approved by the MDA.
   4.7.2. ACAT II and III programs are required to establish an APB. APBs can be entered into
   the APB module in SMART (preferred), or a suitable alternative can be provided to
   SAF/AQXR, via the SAF/AQXR Workflow.
   4.7.3. For additional information refer to the APB guide in AFPAM 63-128.
4.8. Development RFP Release Decision. MDAs shall conduct a review prior to releasing the
final RFP for the EMD phase. The MDA shall approve the AS and review key related planning
documentation. The MDA shall authorize final RFP release and document in an ADM. Other
than the AS, planning documentation may be in draft format for this review.
   4.8.1. In order to meet the intent and requirements of the Development RFP Release
   Decision, ACAT ID and IAM programs will not have a separate AFRB and ASP for
   programs where OSD is the MDA. The AF will conduct a combine ASP/AFRB with no
   further review prior to the MDA holding the review. A template and more information can
   be found at the Acquisition functional page on the AF Portal in the Acquisition Excellence
   and Change Office section.
4.9. Configuration Steering Board (CSB). The CSB reviews all requirements changes and
any significant technical configuration changes that have the potential to result in cost and
schedule impacts to the program. Changes shall not be approved unless funds are identified and
schedule impacts mitigated. The CSB also provides the PM the opportunity to propose
descoping options, with supporting rationale addressing operational implications that would
reduce program cost or moderate requirements. For more information reference Public Law 110-
417 § 814, DoDI 5000.02, and the Defense Acquisition Guide.
   4.9.1. At a minimum, CSBs shall be conducted annually for all ACAT I and IA programs in
   development starting at Milestone A.
       4.9.1.1. Annual CSB reviews will be conducted in conjunction with the annual Program
       Executive Officer Portfolio Reviews and Program Management Reviews.
       4.9.1.2. An event based CSB shall be conducted when a proposed change to program
       requirements would result in significant technical configuration changes that potentially
       result in cost and schedule impacts to the program.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                               41


       4.9.1.3. Mandatory participants for the ACAT I and IA CSB include: SAF/AQ (Chair),
       OSD AT&L (Rep), CSAF Rep (A4I), Using MAJCOM Requirements (e.g., ACC/A8),
       AF/A5R, Joint Staff, SAF/FMB, SAF/AQ Mil Deputy, and the AFPEO for the program.
       4.9.1.4. Additional CSB attendees may include as appropriate: SAF/AQX, SAF/AQC,
       SAF/AQR, SAF/AQI/AQP/AQL/AQQ/AQS, AFMC/CC/CV/CA, AFSPC/CC/CV/CA,
       SAF/GCQ, AF/A8P, SAF/FMC, SAF/CIO A6, SAF/IE/IEL, AF/A2, AF/A4/A4L,
       AF/TE, AFOTEC, and/or DOT&E.
       4.9.1.5. CSB guidance and briefing templates are located at the Acquisition functional
       page on the AF Portal in the Acquisition Excellence and Change Office section.
   4.9.2. The PEO shall ensure the intent of the CSB is met for all delegated ACAT II and
   ACAT III programs by:
       4.9.2.1. Ensuring a process is in place to review all requirements changes and any
       significant technical configuration changes that have the potential to result in cost and
       schedule impacts to the program. This process will include appropriate stakeholders
       from the using MAJCOM, HAF, and the program execution chain.
       4.9.2.2. Considering not approving changes unless funds are identified and schedule
       impacts mitigated.
       4.9.2.3. Providing the PM the opportunity to propose descoping options, with supporting
       rationale addressing operational implications that would reduce program cost or moderate
       requirements.
4.10. Independent Program Assessment (IPA). For Space Acquisition Programs (as defined
in 5000.02), the PM shall ensure an IPA is conducted before each milestone and whenever
directed by the MDA. IPAs are designed to identify program cost, schedule, and performance
risks; formulate handling/mitigation plans; and provide feedback to the program manager and
reports to the MDA. For best practices and schedule recommendations refer to AFPAM 63-128.
4.11. DELETED.
4.12. Test Planning. The PM shall establish an Integrated Test Team (ITT), develop and
document test planning and level of test support required for the life cycle of the system, and
conduct readiness reviews IAW AFI 99-103 and AFMAN 63-119, Certification of Readiness for
Dedicated Operational Test and Evaluation. PMs shall be aware of test and evaluation planning

  At Milestone C (or any other decision point that leads to production or procurement of end
  items to be used for operations) for any program, project, product, or system that has
  deliverable end items that meet the capitalization threshold, the program’s General
  Equipment description will identify the following deliverables at a detail level consistent
  with level 2 of the Program Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (detailed guidance on the
  work breakdown structures for defense materiel items is located in MIL-STD-881):
     4.16.4.1. The assets meeting the capitalization thresholds.
     4.16.4.2. The government furnished material that will be included in the assets.
     4.16.4.3. Other deliverables that will accompany the assets (e.g., manuals, technical data,
     etc.).
     4.16.4.4. Other types of deliverables that will be bought with program funding (e.g.,
     initial spares, support equipment, etc.) but that cannot be directly attributed to a specific
     asset.
  4.16.5. The PM shall ensure proper accounting and contractual allocation of program
  expenditures between capitalized assets and expenses. This shall be completed for every
  program, project, product, or system that has deliverable assets. Detailed guidance on
  accounting policy and procedures may be found in DoD 7000.14-R, DoD FMR Volume 4.
     4.16.5.1. The PM shall ensure the gross book value of equipment assets and modification
     to those assets are provided in accordance with AFI 21-103, Equipment, Inventory, Status

   4.16.6. The PM shall provide the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) with the military
   evaluation requirements so the PCO can create the proper contract line item number (CLIN)
   and sub-line item number (SLIN) to reflect the distinction necessary to facilitate appropriate
   financial accounting treatment of the equipment to be acquired. Proposals, solicitations,
   contracts, and/or orders for or related to the acquisition of equipment will be structured so
   that each type of item or service is properly segregated by use of separate CLINs and SLINs.
   4.16.7. PMs shall ensure all Government property to support their program, including
   property in the possession of contractors, is accountable in the correct Accountable Property
   Systems of Record (APSR) IAW AFI 23-111.
4.17. Government Cost Estimates. The PM shall update life cycle cost estimates in
accordance with AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics, and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis,
and compare them to the program budget to assess program executability. Risk assessments and
sensitivity analyses will be performed as level of knowledge and assumptions change. The
acquisition strategy must address the estimated program cost and the planned program funding,
to include advance procurement. As part of sustainment cost management, the PM shall ensure
current technical and programmatic data is provided to Cost Estimators in support of life cycle
cost estimates. See DoD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
(FMRS) Vol. 2A for more details.
4.18. Cost Estimating and Confidence Level. The PM shall provide cost estimates at the
mean confidence level to the MDA during reviews. The PM shall provide the MDA with
estimates at a cumulative density function (S curve) to show varying levels of confidence. To
the greatest extent possible, the PM shall identify the Total Ownership Cost (TOC) and the major
drivers to this cost. Realistic program planning assumptions should be developed to ensure
adequate analysis of life cycle cost, schedule, and performance risks. This will be documented in
the Program Office Estimate, which is generally developed from the Cost Analysis Requirements
Description (CARD) for major programs or a similar document for less than major programs.
Refer to DFARS 215 for additional information and AFI 65-508, Cost Analysis Guidance and
Procedures, for Air Force cost analysis requirements.
   4.18.1. For MDAP and MAIS programs, state the confidence level used in establishing the
   cost estimate and the rationale for selecting it for cost estimates used in support of MS A, MS
   B, MS C, Low Rate Initial Production, Full Rate Production, any certification under 10 USC
   §2366a, 2366b, or 2433a, any report under 10 USC §2445c, or as specified by appropriate
   authority.
   4.18.2. The confidence level statement shall be included in (a) any decision document
   approving a cost estimate; (b) any other cost estimate requested by DCAPE or the MDA for
   MDAP and MAIS programs; (c) the APB; (d) the ADM as determined by the MDA; (e) any
   cost estimates for MDAP and MAIS prepared in association with the estimates identified
   above; (f) the next Selected Acquisition Report prepared in compliance with 10 USC § 2432
   for MDAPs; and (g) the next quarterly report prepared in compliance with 10 USC § 2445c
   for MAIS.
   4.18.3. All AF ACAT I and II program cost estimates shall provide a range of potential costs
   based upon a robust assessment of, and accounting for, cost, technical, and schedule
   uncertainty for each program. Each cost estimate and associated risk assessment shall be
   established using approved AF cost estimating procedures and shall consider technical,
 46                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   schedule, and programmatic risk assessments to produce a cost estimate distribution or,
   where a distribution cannot be computed, a range of potential program costs.
   4.18.4. To establish sufficient program funding, the MDA for an ACAT I or II program shall
   use the cost estimate distribution to make a deliberate choice of the cost estimate confidence
   level for the program. The selection of the appropriate program cost estimate confidence
   level is at the discretion of the MDA, however, an ACAT I and II program budget shall not
   be established at a confidence level lower than the mean of the program cost estimate
   distribution (typically 55 – 65% confidence level) or, where a distribution cannot be
   computed, the expected value of the cost estimate. For AF ACAT ID programs, SAF/AQ
   shall, in concert with SAF/FM, apply this approach in formulating the Service Cost Position.
   4.18.5. When selecting a confidence level, the MDA shall consider program-specific
   requirements, schedule, and technical maturity issues, as well as interrelationships with other
   programs and program increments, and any other relevant environmental considerations. The
   cost estimate confidence level shall be documented in the ADM and other
   deliverables/documents as required. The same approach should also be followed for
   programs below ACAT II.
   4.18.6. Independent Cost Estimates are required for MDAPs and MAIS programs in advance
   of: (1) MS A, MS B, LRIP, and full rate production; (2) Any certification pursuant to 10
   U.S.C §2366a, 2366b, or 2433a.; (3) Any report pursuant to 10 U.S.C §2445c.; and (4) At
   any time specified by the MDA or the DCAPE.
4.19. Will-Cost and Should-Cost Management. Will-Cost and Should-Cost management shall
be implemented for all ACAT I, II, and III programs.
   4.19.1. Will-Cost and Should-Cost estimates are required at Milestone Decisions for all
   ACAT I, II, and III programs and shall be updated annually. Waivers to annual updates shall
   be approved IAW with AFI 65-508.
   4.19.2. Will-Cost.
      4.19.2.1. AF guidance and instruction (e.g., AFPD 65-5 and AFI 65-508) describe
      specific requirements for non-advocate Will-Cost estimates or Service Cost Positions in
      support of ACAT I milestone decisions.
      4.19.2.2. ACAT II and III programs shall present at Milestone Decisions Will-Cost
      estimates that have been approved by the appropriate financial management cost
      estimating organization.
      4.19.2.3. The non-advocate Will-Cost estimate shall be used as the basis for all
      budgeting and programming decisions.
   4.19.3. Should-Cost.
      4.19.3.1. PMs for ACAT I, II and III programs shall present Should-Cost estimates at the
      milestone decision. The MDA shall approve all initial Should-Cost estimates and will
      expect program managers to manage, report, and track to these estimates. The PEOs
      shall review and approve Should-Cost estimates for ACAT II and III programs.
      4.19.3.2. PMs shall develop Should-Cost estimates and seek assistance from outside
      organizations (e.g. SAF/AQX, SAF/AQC, Air Force Cost Analysis Agency and the
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                47


       Defense Contract Management Agency.) throughout the development process. This
       effort should employ cross-functional teams, where practical, to perform detailed
       bottoms-up assessments on every ACAT I, II, and III program.
4.20. Use of Specifications and Standards. Consistent with the Defense Standardization
Program and the Air Force Standardization Program (refer to DoDI 4120.24 and AFI 60-101
respectively), decisions to standardize must be balanced against specific mission requirements,
technology growth, and cost effectiveness. Specifications and standards shall be used in
solicitations and contracts to define essential standard practices (e.g., system safety and parts
management) and technical requirements (e.g., materiel interoperability and support
requirements) and to manage risk. Specific DoD policy on the use of specifications and
standards and other methods to achieve objectives required by 10 USC §2451-2457, DoDI
2010.06, Materiel Standardization and Interoperability with Allies and Coalition Partners,
DoDD 5000.01, and DoDI 5000.02 are contained in DoD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization
Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures. Additional guidance on the use of specifications and
standards in architecting is contained in AFI 33-401, Air Force Architecting.
4.21. Program Protection Planning. The PM shall apply comprehensive program protection
planning in order to provide secure, uncompromised military systems to the warfighter. The PM
shall ensure a program’s Critical Program Information (CPI) and mission-critical functions and
components are protected to keep technological advantages in and malicious content out in
accordance with DoDI 5200.39, Critical Program Information (CPI) Protection within the

       and responsibility for the PPP shall transfer to the PM from the technology development
       activity solely when a technology is incorporated into a system and remains with the PM
       throughout the life of the system.
       4.21.1.2. For legacy systems, PPP requirements for modifications can be satisfied by
       updating or annexing to an existing PPP, creating a separate PPP for each modification,
       or creating a new PPP for the entire weapon system addressing all modification
       protection measures with provisions for annexes to cover future modifications.
       4.21.1.3. Refer to AFPAM 63-113, DoDI 5200.44, and DoDI 5200.39 for critical

  4.21.3. Special Access Programs (SAP). SAPs created under the authority of Executive
  Order 13526 are exempt from compliance, however collateral programs with acknowledged
  SAP elements shall comply. When SAP elements transition to collateral status, those
  elements shall also meet the requirements of this AFI. The PM will collaborate with
  Director, Security, Counterintelligence and Special Programs (SAF/AAZ) when SAP
  information is involved to determine a prudent protection approach prior to developing a
  PPP.
  4.21.4. Counterfeit Detection and Avoidance. PMs shall identify and maintain an updated
  list of critical components vulnerable to counterfeiting throughout the system life cycle. PMs
  shall ensure contracts require prime contractors take the steps necessary to implement
  management controls to guard against counterfeit materiel in the supply chain. See DoDI

Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS); DoDI 4630.8, Procedures for
Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and National Security
Systems (NSS); and CJCSI 6212.01, Net Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR KPP).
   4.23.1. The PM shall prepare an ISP for IT and NSS programs regardless of ACAT and for
   systems in sustainment that exchange information of any type to other systems (e.g., not a
   stand-alone system or application). The Lead Command, as part of the requirements process
   and identification of Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP), shall identify IT and
   NSS interoperability requirements, infrastructure, and other support requirements early in the
   life cycle.
   4.23.2. Information Support Plans (including NSS) are required at the following intervals:
   Milestone B (Initial ISP), Critical Design Review (Revised ISP) (unless waived), Milestone
   C (ISP of Record).
   4.23.3. The PM shall update/develop the ISP for a major modification to an IT/NSS system.
   A modification is major if any one of the following applies: the modification exceeds 10% of
   ACAT II minimum thresholds, the modification results in a change to the JCIDS or other
   requirements documents, or the Net-Ready KPP is changed or a new one developed.
   4.23.4. For systems that will be part of a Family of Systems or System of Systems
   (FoS/SoS), an ISP is required unless waived. If the Milestone Decision Authority
   (MDA)/Cognizant Fielding Authority for the FoS/SoS approves, an annex to the FoS/SoS
   ISP may be developed to meet ISP requirements for a new system that is part of a FoS/SoS.
   4.23.5. PMs that do not believe their IT or NSS system requires the development of an ISP
   shall submit a request to waive the ISP requirement IAW DoDI 4630.8.
   4.23.6. If an intelligence appendix is developed, the PM shall coordinate the plan with the
   Center Intelligence Office and AFSPC or AFMC Intelligence Office.
   4.23.7. ISPs prepared for Milestone Decision Reviews shall undergo the formal ISP review
   process before they can be approved by the MDA. ACAT I, ACAT IA, and special interest
   programs are reviewed at both the Air Force and Joint level. For ACAT II and below
   programs, the owning DoD Component shall select the appropriate additional DoD
   Components for the joint review; however, the review shall include at a minimum the Joint
   Staff and DISA. Review the following publications for detailed guidance and information on
   authority, roles and responsibility relating to the Information Support Plan: DoDD 4630.05,
   DoDI 4630.8, and CJCSI 6212.01. Reference the Information Support Plan Policy CoP and
   the Air Force Program Manager’s Guide for Developing, Processing, and Approving
   Information Support Plans for more information on the development, review, coordination,
   and approval of Information Support Plans.
4.24. Arms Control Compliance. The PM shall ensure all activities within the acquisition life
cycle are compliant with all United States Government arms control obligations IAW AFI 16-
601, Implementation of, and Compliance With, International Arms Control and Nonproliferation
Agreements. This assessment will occur prior to all Milestone reviews or when concerns arise,
whichever is earlier. If necessary, the PM shall seek (with Deputy Chief of Staff, Operation,
Plans, and Requirements, (AF/A3/5) assistance) clearance to undertake or continue the activity in
question from the appropriate Arms Control Compliance Review Group. PMs who oversee
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                   51


acquisition programs involving strategic weapons (e.g., bombs, warheads), their delivery
vehicles (e.g., ballistic missiles, bombers, and cruise missiles, including their associated basing,
testing, and launch facilities), or chemical and biological weapon defense-related materials and
equipment should become aware of the implications and limitations that arms control treaties
may have on or impact their program(s).
4.25. Legal Reviews. The PM shall ensure that all weapons and cyber capabilities are reviewed
for legality at the earliest possible stage IAW AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber
Capabilities. A legal review is required for both new acquisitions and modifications of existing
weapons and cyber capabilities.
4.26. Security Cooperation and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Security cooperation and
FMS programs support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives by enabling the
United States to build, sustain, expand, and guide international partnerships that are critical
enablers for its national security objectives.
   4.26.1. The PM shall ensure Security cooperation FMS acquisition programs are executed in
   accordance with the Arms Export Control Act and DSCA 5105.38-M, Security Assistance
   Management Manual (SAMM), DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R; AFMAN
   16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management; and DoD 5105.65-M,
   Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Case Reconciliation and Closure Manual. Implementation
   shall also be in accordance with the DoD 5000 acquisition series; the 99-series test AFIs; the
   63-series acquisition AFIs; 14-series AFIs, and the 16-series operations support AFIs.
   4.26.2. The PM responsibility for FMS programs is limited to elements/tasks contained in a
   government-to-government agreement and specifically implemented for execution to the PM,
   through the appropriate accountability reporting chain, by the assigned DoD component
   authority over the specific agreement.
4.27. Human Systems Integration (HSI). The PM shall employ human systems integration
(HSI) to incorporate manpower, personnel, training, human factors engineering, safety,
occupational health, personnel survivability, and habitability considerations to contribute to total
system performance (hardware, software, and human) and the reduction of total ownership cost
across the life-cycle. The PM may consult SG Occupational Medicine and Bio Engineer SMEs
for current medical and environmental guidance to ensure proper risk management and inclusion
in technical reviews. Refer to AFPAM 63-128 for more information.
4.28. Management of AF Training Systems. Refer to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force
Training Systems, for specific requirements and responsibilities associated with the life cycle of
training systems, including aircrew mission training systems, maintenance training systems, and
training services attendant to AF systems. Lead Commands may request PM participation in
Training Planning Teams activities including accomplishing the Training System Requirements
Analysis and the development of System Training Plans. Training systems that have been
designated as stand-alone acquisition programs shall be governed in accordance with this
instruction.
   4.28.1. The PM shall coordinate their program plans and activities with the Training System
   PGM, lead commands, and HQ Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as necessary
   to meet training system life cycle cost, schedule, and performance requirements.
 52                                                        AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   4.28.2. The PM shall include system training concepts and training system requirements in
   all ASs prepared for, and subsequent to, MS B. As appropriate, the PM will include training
   system PMs, lead and using commands, and HQ AETC during the development of system
   acquisition strategies, program plans, and pertinent contract documents such as System
   Requirements Documents.
   4.28.3. The PM shall ensure training systems remain current with prime mission systems
   throughout the life cycle of a system in accordance with approved program documentation
   and funding. The PM shall ensure that all post-production system modification and upgrade
   programs conducted for prime mission systems also include modifications to the effected
   training systems.
   4.28.4. The Lead Command and PM shall determine the training system fielding
   requirements necessary to support the fielding of prime systems and equipment. The PM
   shall coordinate training system product acceptance, movement, and delivery matters with
   the lead commands that will receive the training system(s).
   4.28.5. The PM shall assist lead commands with management and reporting of training
   system concurrency matters.
   4.28.6. The PM shall manage and execute the disposal of training devices in accordance with
   federal acquisition regulation and supplements, AFI 23-101, and AFI 23-501, Retaining and
   Transferring Materiel, as applicable. The PM will coordinate actions for the declassification
   and demilitarization of training devices, the removal and repatriation of system-common
   equipment, and the disposal of hazardous materials prior to the shipment of training devices
   to the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services or other final resting places.
4.29. End Use Certificates (EUC). The Air Force purchases foreign products to obtain
products that best meet U.S. requirements, consistent with U.S. laws, regulations, and acquisition
policy.    Acquisitions of foreign products that meet DoD requirements also promote
interoperability, standardization, and an expanded procurement base. EUCs shall be executed
when the purchase of such products is in the best interest of the United States and an EUC is
required by the foreign government for the purchase of foreign products. See DODD 2040.3,
End Use Certificates (EUC), for more details.
   4.29.1. U.S. worldwide security responsibilities are extensive; recognition of these special
   circumstances require flexibility in international agreements in the authorized uses or transfer
   of purchased or co-developed articles and data. In various circumstances, international
   agreements have recognized U.S. “Use for Defense Purposes” of an item or data. Air Force
   personnel should seek to maintain “Use for Defense Purposes” flexibility in EUCs that
   foreign governments require DoD to sign.
   4.29.2. EUCs are divided into three categories:
       4.29.2.1. Category I. Applies to acquisition items classified for security purposes by a
       foreign government and covered by the nonproliferation agreements to which the United
       States is a party (such as missile technology). This permits the item to be used by or for
       the U.S. Government in any part of the world and transfer by means of grant aid,
       International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, FMS, and other security
       assistance and armaments cooperation authorities.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                                53


       4.29.2.2. Category II. Applies to all other items not defined as either Category I or III.
       4.29.2.3. Category III. Limits the right to use an item by or for the U.S. Government in
       any part of the world; or to provide the item to allies engaged together with the United
       States in armed conflict with a common enemy.
   4.29.3. EUCs are a two part process consisting of approval of the EUC and signature of the
   EUC. EUCs shall be approved prior to contract award. Requests to delegate signature
   authority shall be part of the approval package. Approval and signature authorities for EUCs
   are as follows:
       4.29.3.1. Category I and II. The SECAF, or a delegated civilian officer, appointed by the
       President with the advice and consent of the Senate, is the approval authority for
       Category I and II EUCs. This approval authority may not be further re-delegated.
       Following approval, signature authority can be delegated to PEO.
       4.29.3.2. Category III. The SECAF or the SECAF representative must request authority
       from the USD(AT&L) to purchase an item with a Category III EUC. Following
       approval, signature authority can be delegated to PEO.
   4.29.4. The PM shall maintain records of all EUCs and provide copies to USD(AT&L).
       4.29.4.1. The PM should ensure compliance, for the life of the purchased item, with the
       transfer of use restrictions agreed to in signing an EUC.
       4.29.4.2. The PM shall notify MAJCOM headquarters of the EUC approval and explain
       any restrictions on the use, transfer, or disposal of the item’s hardware, technology, and
       associated technical data.
4.30. Other Acquisition Planning Requirements. The PM shall consider the planning
requirements in Table 4.2. The planning requirements do not apply to all programs and should
only be applied when required for the program.

                                           Chapter 5

                                 SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

5.1. Systems Engineering (SE) Overview. AF SE objectives are to provide a balanced
approach in delivering a capability to war fighter and support program success through
systematically increasing maturity and reducing risk over the acquisition life cycle. The AF has
adopted the DAG definition of SE: “A logical sequence of activities and decisions transforming
an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and a preferred system
configuration.” It requires optimization at the system level, using SE processes (paragraph 5.2.)
throughout the lifecycle (paragraph 5.3.) to integrate user capability needs with design
considerations (paragraph 5.4.) to affordably satisfy customer needs. AF PEOs and PMs,
through their LSEs, shall implement SE in accordance with DoDI 5000.02 and AF-unique
direction provided in this AFI. The Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) establishes the DoD
expectations for implementation of DoDI 5000.02 for ACAT ID and other OSD-reviewed
programs. For consistency and interoperability, this chapter is aligned with DoDI 5000.02 and
the DAG.
   5.1.1. Systems Engineering Plan (SEP). The PM’s fundamental technical planning document
   is the SEP. It defines methods for implementing all system requirements having technical
   content, technical staffing, and technical management.
       5.1.1.1. This AFI delegates SEP approval authority from the SAE to the PEO for ACAT
       I and II programs. For ACAT III programs, the MDA is the approval authority. PEOs for
       ACAT I, IA, and non-delegated ACAT II programs shall coordinate SEPs with
       SAF/AQR prior to approval.
       5.1.1.2. The PM, with the support of the LSE, shall prepare a SEP for formal approval at
       MS A, MS B, and MS C. The PM shall comply with standard content and format of the
       DoD SEP Outline. SEPs should reference organization or portfolio standard engineering
       process documents, if appropriate.       Deviations from these referenced standard
       engineering processes should be documented in the SEP.
       5.1.1.3. The LSE shall review the SEP annually to ensure its currency and consistency
       with other program documentation. The SEP should be a “living” “go to” technical
       planning document and the blueprint for the conduct, management, and control of the
       technical aspects of the government’s program from concept to disposal. SE planning
       should be kept current throughout the acquisition lifecycle.
       5.1.1.4. The PM shall ensure that the contractor systems engineering approach is aligned
       to the program’s SEP.
   5.1.2. Assurance of Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E). The PM is
   responsible for assuring the OSS&E of systems and end items. OSS&E is an outcome of
   properly applied engineering principles, processes, and practices as opposed to a separate
   discipline, process, or design consideration. Configuration management and control,
   deficiency reporting and response, reliability, maintainability, integrity, ESOH risk
   management, mishap investigation, and other engineering practices combine to assure that
   systems and end items remain operationally safe, suitable, and effective across the life cycle.
56                                                      AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


  The PM shall include representatives of the operational, maintenance/sustainment, safety,
  and test and evaluation communities in this effort. In order for the PM to assure overall
  system OSS&E, the PM shall establish and document relationships and responsibilities with
  other organizations that support or interface with systems or end items managed by the PM.
  The PM shall monitor the fielded system by tracking and evaluating system data to ensure
  the preservation of OSS&E.
     5.1.2.1. Operational Safety. The level of safety risk to the system, the environment, and
     the occupational health caused by a system or end item when employed in an operational
     environment. The PM shall utilize the established system safety process to assure
     operational safety.
     5.1.2.2. Operational Suitability. The degree to which a system or end item can be placed
     satisfactorily in field use, with consideration given to availability, compatibility,
     transportability, interoperability, reliability, maintainability, wartime use rates, full-
     dimension protection, operational safety, human factors, architectural and infrastructure
     compliance, manpower supportability, logistics supportability, natural environmental
     effects and impacts, and documentation and training requirements.
     5.1.2.3. Operational Effectiveness. The overall degree of mission accomplishment of a
     system or end item used by representative personnel in the environment planned or
     expected (e.g., natural, electronic, threat) for operational employment, considering
     organization, doctrine, tactics, information assurance, force protection, survivability,
     vulnerability, and threat (including countermeasures; initial nuclear weapons effects; and
     nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination threats). The PM maintains the
     operational effectiveness of the system by ensuring that it continues to satisfy the
     documented user capability requirements.
  5.1.3. Certifications. Certifications provide a formal acknowledgement by a mandatory
  approval authority that a system or program meets specific requirements.
     5.1.3.1. The PM shall include in the SEP applicable certifications for the program and
     when they are required. The PM shall also include certification activities and events in
     the IMS. The PM shall ensure all required certifications are obtained prior to testing and
     operational use, and maintained for the life of the system.
     5.1.3.2. DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 4, and the DAG provide a list of statutory and
     regulatory requirements and certifications.
  5.1.4. SE Role in Contracts. SE requirements must be included in each program contracting
  effort to ensure offerors provide sufficient SE resources. The primary tool for shaping a
  program contract is the RFP.
     5.1.4.1. The LSE shall participate in the RFP development team and be responsible for
     all technical aspects of the RFP. The LSE shall, at a minimum, ensure that the RFP:
         5.1.4.1.1. References required operational documentation and specifications;
         5.1.4.1.2. Identifies appropriate design requirements         (e.g.   reliability   and
         maintainability, corrosion prevention, ESOH, and security);
         5.1.4.1.3. Identifies government-required technical data to be produced by the
         contractor;
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                  57


          5.1.4.1.4. Specifies testing and verification requirements;
          5.1.4.1.5. Specifies all technical review and technical documentation requirements.
       5.1.4.2. The DoD Guide for Integrating Systems Engineering into Contracts provides
       additional guidance on SE role in contracts.
   5.1.5. System of Systems (SoS) and Family of Systems (FoS) Engineering. SE for SoS/FoS
   emphasizes interoperability among systems developed under different sponsorship,
   management, and primary acquisition processes, and often operated by other Services,
   Agencies, allies, and coalition partners.
       5.1.5.1. The PM shall analyze the program’s CONOPS and capability document to
       identify external dependencies and interoperability needs and ensure that they are
       integrated into the program’s requirements decomposition, risk management, interface
       management, architecture, verification, validation and other processes.
       5.1.5.2. M&S is an effective means for understanding complex SoS/FoS, and can
       provide insights into interoperability in the SoS/FoS mission context.
       5.1.5.3. The PM shall identify interdependent systems that may be impacted by a
       proposed baseline change, and during the design process, coordinate the change with the
       PMs (or equivalents) of the affected systems.
   5.1.6. Air Force Technical Authority. SAF/AQR is the Air Force Chief Engineer and
   Technical Authority per HAF MD 1-10. The Air Force Chief Engineer and Technical
   Authority provides the SAE unbiased technical advice for pre-acquisition investment
   decisions and throughout the acquisition life cycle; engages Implementing Commands and
   Center-level engineering offices to provide technical support to PEOs and PMs; oversees AF
   Engineering Enterprise policy and guidance; and directs external technical assessments of
   programs, as needed.
5.2. Systems Engineering Processes. The DAG identifies eight technical management
processes and eight technical processes. Application of SE processes enables sound decision-
making which increases capability maturity and reduces risk. For consistency, this AFI adopts
DoD SE process terminology. The PM shall document the tailoring of SE processes in the SEP.
   5.2.1. Technical Management Processes.
       5.2.1.1. Technical Planning.       Technical planning identifies processes, schedules,
       personnel/skills, facilities, and other internal and external resources necessary for the
       technical effort. The SEP is the program’s fundamental technical planning document
       (see paragraph 5.1.1.), but the LSE substantially contributes to other program
       documentation including the IMP, IMS, WBS, AS, TEMP, LCSP, RFP, PPP, IUID plan,
       CPCP, and PESHE.
       5.2.1.2. Decision Analysis. Decision analysis helps the PM and the LSE understand the
       impact that uncertainty has on decision-making, and identifies and communicates a
       course of action that best balances competing objectives. The LSE identifies, organizes,
       and executes necessary trade studies to support program technical decisions and present
       the resulting recommendations to the PM.
58                                                      AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


     5.2.1.3. Technical Assessment. Technical assessment consists of formal technical
     reviews established by DoDI 5000.02, internal assessments of program technical
     performance against measures, and external assessments and audits. Formal technical
     reviews assess design progress, technical risk, and program maturity at key points in life
     cycle, and determine whether to proceed to next level of development. The principal
     formal technical reviews are the Alternative Systems Review, System Requirements
     Review, System Functional Review, Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design
     Review (CDR), System Verification Review, Functional Configuration Audit, Production
     Readiness Review (PRR), and Physical Configuration Audit.
        5.2.1.3.1. The PM and LSE co-chair principal formal technical reviews. The PM
        ensures that principal formal technical reviews are event-driven and that entrance and
        exit criteria are established ahead of time as identified in the SEP.
        5.2.1.3.2. For MDAPs, the PM shall invite SAF/AQR and independent SMEs from
        outside the program to attend principal formal technical reviews and shall invite
        cognizant DASD(SE) staff members to the CDR.
        5.2.1.3.3. Technology Readiness Assessments (TRA). TRA is the primary tool to
        assess maturity of critical technologies. TRAs are mandatory for MDAPs at MS B
        (or at a subsequent milestone if there is no MS B) per DoDI 5000.02. They are not
        required for MAIS programs, non-MDAPs or MDAP MS C decisions, except for
        MDAPs entering the acquisition process at MS C. MDAs for non-ACAT I programs
        should require the PM to perform a TRA for a program with high technological risk.
        If a program is required to conduct a TRA, the PM must obtain SAF/AQR approval
        on behalf of SAF/AQ for each of the following: TRA Plan, final critical technology
        list, Draft (also known as ‘Preliminary’) TRA Report, and Final TRA Report.
        Reference USD(AT&L) Memo, Improving Technology Readiness Assessment
        Effectiveness, 11 May 2011, and Department of Defense Technology Readiness
        Assessment (TRA) Guidance.
        5.2.1.3.4. For Space Acquisition Programs, the MDA shall conduct a Post-System
        Design Review Assessment (P-SDRA). This is normally conducted prior to the PDR
        and MS B.
        5.2.1.3.5. SAF/AQR will support OSD chaired technical assessments such as
        Program Support Reviews.
        5.2.1.3.6. SAF/AQR will direct external technical assessments, as needed, if
        technology maturity, manufacturing readiness, or other technical issues pose critical
        cost, schedule, or performance risks for the program. The PM shall support
        SAF/AQR directed external technical assessments which are designed to identify the
        sources of technical risk; formulate handling/mitigation plans; collect objective
        feedback; and provide results and recommendations to the PM, PEO, SAF/AQR, and
        the MDA.
     5.2.1.4. Requirements Management. The PM implements a consistent and rigorous
     process for development, establishment, and control of technical requirements. The PM
     ensures that all requirements in the system specification are traceable to stated user
     capability needs.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                59


     5.2.1.5. Risk Management. The LSE ensures that technical risks are incorporated into
     the program’s overall risk management effort as described in Chapter 3.
     5.2.1.6. Configuration Management (CM). CM establishes and maintains consistency of
     program baselines throughout the life cycle. CM is an essential element of the PM’s
     effort to assure OSS&E. MIL-HDBK-61, Configuration Management Guidance,
     contains detailed information about CM.
         5.2.1.6.1. The PM shall use CM to establish and control product attributes and
         technical baselines across the total system life cycle. Baselines shall be updated to
         reflect any modifications or changes to the product, system or end-item.
         5.2.1.6.2. PM shall ensure key CM practices and responsibilities are summarized in
         the SEP in accordance with the DoD SEP Outline.
     5.2.1.7. Data Management (DM). DM identifies, acquires, manages, maintains, and
     provides access to the technical data and computer software required to manage and
     support a system throughout its life cycle. See Chapter 6.
     5.2.1.8. Interface Management (IM). The IM process ensures interface definition and
     compliance among the internal elements that comprise a system, as well as with other
     systems. The LSE ensures that all internal and external interface requirement changes are
     documented in accordance with the program’s CM plan.
  5.2.2. Technical Processes.
     5.2.2.1. Stakeholder Requirements Definition. The PM and LSE work with the user to
     establish, assess and refine operational needs, attributes, performance parameters, and
     constraints that flow from and influence user described capabilities.
     5.2.2.2. Requirements Analysis. The purpose of the requirements analysis process is to
     ensure that stakeholder requirements are analyzed, decomposed and functionally detailed
     across the design concept. The PM ensures that all relevant program requirements and
     design considerations (see paragraph 5.4.) are addressed in program specifications and
     baselines.
     5.2.2.3. Architecture Design. The PM shall ensure that architectural descriptions
     conform to the requirements of the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF). For IT and
     NSS, the PM shall work with the applicable sponsor to ensure architectures are developed
     in accordance with CJCSI 3170.01, CJCSI 6212.01 and AFI 33-401, Air Force
     Architecting. For IT and NSS, the PM shall also ensure that the architectures are aligned
     with the Air Force Enterprise Architecture and DoD Business Enterprise Architecture
     (BEA) when applicable.
         5.2.2.3.1. The PM and LSE ensures that architecture products include the program’s
         system as well as its potential interfaces and/or impacts to external systems (i.e., the
         Family-of-Systems / System-of-Systems (FoS/SoS) environment). The PM develops
         architecture products as early as possible and maintains them throughout the life
         cycle.
         5.2.2.3.2. The PM shall conduct architecture-based assessments of trades in the
         overall operational context. The PM shall ensure that each principal formal technical
 60                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


          review includes an architecture-based assessment to confirm that the system
          development remains aligned to the operational requirements.
          5.2.2.3.3. All architectures shall be approved in accordance with AFI 33-401,
          including any architecture that goes to the AFROC or JROC.
      5.2.2.4. Implementation. Implementation provides the system design and creates the
      lowest level subsystems in the system hierarchy by increasing subsystem maturity,
      reducing subsystem risk, and ensuring the subsystems are ready for integration,
      verification, and validation.
      5.2.2.5. Integration. Integration systematically assembles lower level system elements
      into successively higher-level subsystems, with subsystem verification at each step.
      5.2.2.6. Verification. Verification confirms that the program’s system satisfies system
      specifications. The PM shall manage verification activities, to include developmental
      testing, and review the results of verification throughout the life cycle.
      5.2.2.7. Validation. Validation provides objective evidence that the system meets user
      capability needs and achieves its intended use in its intended operational environment.
      OT&E is a core validation process. Refer to AFI 99-103 for more information on T&E
      processes. The PM shall ensure the system is ready for OT&E.
      5.2.2.8. Transition. Transition delivers and sustains a system for the end user.
          5.2.2.8.1. The LSE works with the PSM to ensure that the LCSP includes appropriate
          technical information for sustainment and product support.
          5.2.2.8.2. The PM shall provide Technical Orders and other maintenance and
          supportability technical data to the end user IAW Chapter 6.
          5.2.2.8.3. The PM shall establish and maintain deficiency reporting processes
          appropriate to the life cycle phase and ensure that all validated deficiency reports are
          tracked to actual resolution of the deficiency. The LSE documents this process in the
          SEP no later than FRP. Refer to TO-00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting,
          Investigation, and Resolution, for more information.
          5.2.2.8.4. The PM and LSE co-chair in-service review(s) to address deficiencies.
5.3. SE Activities in the Life Cycle. SE must be an integral part of the life cycle from
development planning through system demilitarization and disposal.
   5.3.1. Early SE. Early SE encompasses pre-acquisition technical planning, principally in
   support of MDD and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), to ensure leadership is offered trade
   space for portfolio and risk management. The results of early SE and concept development
   activities are documented in the Concept Characterization and Technical Description
   (CCTD) and are the principal artifacts of Early SE. The AF Early SE Guide and the AF
   CCTD Guide provide additional information.
      5.3.1.1. CCTD’s prepared for an Air Force Requirements Review Group (AFRRG)
      preceding MDD shall be provided to SAF/AQR 90 days prior to the AFRRG. SAF/AQR
      shall review the CCTD and provide technical recommendations to the AFRRG.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                61


   5.3.2. SE during System Development. During system development, SE uses the SE
   processes (paragraph 5.2.) to integrate user capability needs with design considerations
   (paragraph 5.4.) to affordably satisfy customer needs.
   5.3.3. Sustainment SE. Beginning at IOC, sustainment SE is focused on maintaining the
   OSS&E of the system (see 5.1.4. and 5.2.1.4.).
   5.3.4. SE in Support of Demilitarization and Disposal. See Chapter 6.
5.4. SE Design Considerations. This section identifies considerations that the PM and LSE
integrate into the requirements analysis process. The LSE uses SE processes across the life cycle
to accomplish trade-offs to provide balanced solutions, optimized at the system-level, that
affordably satisfy desired user capabilities.       This list includes the AF-unique design
considerations plus the 25 DoD design considerations from the DAG.
   5.4.1. Air Force-Unique Design Considerations.
       5.4.1.1. Recorded Aircraft Information (RAI). All Air Force weapon systems that
       require airworthiness certification shall evaluate and integrate weapon system
       information requirements. The PM, in collaboration with data user stakeholders, shall
       conduct a systematic assessment of information needs (including mishap investigation,
       integrity programs, maintenance and operational analyses) to ensure the capture of
       critical information and optimization of benefit while minimizing cost. The uses of RAI
       include the following:
           5.4.1.1.1. Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA). MFOQA
           provides insight into the operational usage of the aerial system through analysis of
           flight maneuvers and identification of hazard trends and facilitates risk assessment
           and mitigation activities. See AFI 90-1301, Implementing Military Flight Operations
           Quality Assurance, for more information.
              5.4.1.1.1.1. The PM shall provide integrated system solutions that support
              customer-defined MFOQA capability needs for each MDS the AF acquires or
              uses (including manned and unmanned).
              5.4.1.1.1.2. The PM shall assist lead commands in assessing risks and
              determining mitigation measures when MFOQA data analyses identify new
              hazards.
           5.4.1.1.2. Crash Survivable Recorders for Aircraft. All Air Force aircraft requiring
           airworthiness certification shall record crash survivable parametric and acoustic data
           to support mishap investigation that meets the minimum requirements listed in AFH
           63-1402, Aircraft Information Program (will convert to AFMAN 63-134).
              5.4.1.1.2.1. The responsible lead command shall obtain a waiver from the AF
              Vice Chief of Staff for aircraft that are not equipped with minimum required
              capability.
              5.4.1.1.2.2. The PM shall provide cost, schedule, and technical information to
              support a lead command waiver request.
           5.4.1.1.3. Service Use and Performance Data. The collection and monitoring of
           service use and performance data (including maintenance discrepancy reports, user
62                                                      AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


         feedback, system/component failure reports and mishap data) enables the continuous
         assessment of fielded system technical health against documented performance
         requirements and effectiveness, suitability, and risk measures.
            5.4.1.1.3.1. The PM shall integrate system and end-item operational and
            maintenance data collection, storage, and transmission.
            5.4.1.1.3.2. For aircraft, the PM shall integrate user-defined, capability-based,
            enhanced flight data requirements (CBM+, integrity, training, MFOQA, etc.) with
            the mandatory crash survivable recorder requirement when identifying an aircraft
            flight data parameter recording, storage, and transmission capability.
     5.4.1.2. Mission Assurance for Space Programs. The PM shall ensure that Mission
     Assurance is an integral part of the space system development, and is integrated
     throughout life cycle and documented in life cycle documentation.
     5.4.1.3. Product and System Integrity. For all new or modified systems, the PM shall
     plan and implement effective integrity programs. For all aircraft which the Air Force has

         munitions), armaments, air transport and airdrop, medical evacuation, combat search
         and rescue, crash/fire/rescue, and geospatial/intelligence (including classification
         standards).
         5.4.15.2.3. Following approval of the AS, the PM shall notify AF/A5 and SAF/AQ of
         all applicable International Standardization Agreements that are not included in a
         SRD or system specification to allow agreement reservations to be registered with
         appropriate multinational body. Refer to AFI 60-106, The United States Air Force
         International Military Standardization Program, for further information.
  5.4.16. Open Systems. An open systems approach to design development results in
  modular, interoperable systems that allow components to be added, modified, replaced,
  removed and/or supported by different vendors throughout each system’s life cycle. The PM
  shall apply a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and Open Technology
  Development wherever feasible. The LSE uses the technical architecture and market
  research of potential technologies and sources of supply to craft an open system approach
  that maximizes technology reuse and system interoperability, and that reduces dependency
  on proprietary data and total life cycle costs.

                         PRODUCT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Product Support/Sustainment Planning Overview. Product support is a continuous and
collaborative set of activities that establishes and maintains readiness and the operational
capability of a system, subsystem, or end-item throughout its life cycle. A product support
strategy shall be built around the integrated product support elements as identified in the DoD
Product Support Manager Guidebook to integrate the phases of a system throughout its life
cycle. The product support strategy is the business and technical approach to design, acquire,
and field the product support package to execute the sustainment strategy. It begins as a broad
concept and evolves into a detailed implementation plan documented in the LCSP.
   6.1.1. The PM retains overall responsibility for all aspects of program. The PSM reports
   directly to, and is accountable to, the PM for the execution of all product support
   requirements, to include integrity programs and corrosion prevention and control, within the
   PM’s scope of responsibilities. The PSM develops and implements a comprehensive product
   support strategy for each applicable program, for more information on PSM and product
   support responsibilities refer to the PSM Guidebook, Integrated Product Support Element
   Guidebook, and MIL-HDBK-502, Product Support Analysis.
   6.1.2. The PSM shall ensure the appropriate concepts, techniques, and analyses necessary to
   assure achievement of defined supportability and support requirements and objectives are
   applied. The PSM is responsible to the PM to ensure that integrated product support
   objectives are considered and introduced as early as practical with a far-reaching life cycle
   view concerning logistics design and supportability of the system. This activity requires
   integration of current product support concepts into preliminary planning to evaluate the
   various options for product support from the standpoint of life cycle cost and parameters to
   ensure balanced life cycle strategy. The PSM shall conduct periodic reviews at least every
   five years to assess and revalidate the product support strategy and adjust allocations and
   performance requirements to validated warfighter needs.
6.2. Product Support Business Model (PSBM). PSBM is a strategy for product support
planning and management for the life cycle product support. The PM has substantial discretion
in determining the implementation of the PSBM and develop performance-based agreements
with warfighter customer(s), Product Support Integrator (PSIs), and Product Support Provider
(PSPs) to meet the overall performance requirements and support validated warfighter needs.
However, in all implementations of the PSBM, the PSM shall ensure that the support necessary
to satisfy all of the Product Support Elements is within the scope of the agreements with one or
more PSIs.
   6.2.1. Product Support Integrators (PSI). The PSI is defined as an entity within the Federal
   Government or outside the Federal Government charged with integrating all sources of
   product support, both private and public, defined within the scope of a product support
   arrangement. The PSM may have more than one PSI supporting the Program.
   6.2.2. Product Support Providers (PSP). A PSP is an entity that provides product support
   functions. A PSP may be an entity within the DoD, an entity within the private sector, or a
   partnership between such entities.
 70                                                        AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


6.3. Weapon System Sustainment (WSS). WSS is a subset of Readiness and O&S funding
that includes Contract Logistics Support (CLS), Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance
(DPEM), Sustaining Engineering, Technical Orders, organic maintenance, repair and overhaul.
WSS does not encompass all areas of O&S; non-WSS categories include depot level reparables
and consumables for organically managed aircraft and the Flying Hour Program. WSS costs
should be balanced with readiness needs and addressed as part of the product support strategy.
6.4. Centralized Asset Management (CAM). CAM is the management and execution of
sustainment funding by one AF process owner. AFMC is the designated AF CAM Executive
Agent for CAM-associated funding and requirements determination. NOTE: Air National
Guard, AF Reserve Command, AF Space Command, AF Weather Agency and AF Flight
Standards Agency utilize CAM processes and schedules, but manage their own requirements
validation and execution of funds.
   6.4.1. MAJCOMs and PMs shall utilize the HQ AFMC developed CAM procedures, meet
   established timeframes/suspense, and support associated reviews.
       6.4.1.1. MAJCOMs and PMs shall utilize the government registered system Centralized
       Access for Data Exchange (CAFDEx) for defining, validating, prioritizing, and
       publishing system sustainment requirements. Reference the Logistics Requirements
       Determination Process (LRDP) Handbook located on the CAM Community of Practice
       (CoP) website and TO-00-25-4 for additional information.
   6.4.2. MAJCOMs and PMs shall collaborate with HQ AFMC to advocate and ensure all
   requirements associated with systems’ support receive equitable consideration under CAM.
6.5. Performance Based Life Cycle Product Support. Performance based life cycle product
support (synonymous with Performance Based Logistics (PBL)) applies to new programs,
capability and sustainment modifications, and re-procurement of systems, subsystems, and
commodities. Product support considerations should begin prior to MS A with early
requirements determination and continue through system design, development, operational use,
retirement, and disposal. The Product Support Business Model (PSBM) described in the DoD
Product Support Manager Guidebook expands the range of product support strategies.
   6.5.1. The PM shall develop and implement a comprehensive product support strategy. The
   objective of the product support strategy is to achieve operational readiness outcomes.
   Product support strategies are dependent on both organic and commercial industry support
   and shall meet the requirements of DOD 4140.01-M and AFI 23-101. The strategy is based
   upon a best value determination, evidenced through the Business Case Analysis (BCA)
   process, assessing the best mix of public and private capabilities, infrastructure, skills base,
   past performance, and proven capabilities to meet set performance objectives and 10 USC
   §2464 (Core) and 10 USC §2466 (50/50) requirements. Performance is to be defined in the
   terms of military objectives using the criteria of operational availability, operational
   reliability, ownership cost.
   6.5.2. The PSM adjusts performance requirements and resource allocations across Product
   Support Integrators and Product Support Providers as needed to implement the product
   support strategy. The PSM is responsible for optimizing product support during the
   development, implementation, and subsequent revalidation of the product support strategy
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                71


   through twelve Integrated Product Support Elements and performance metrics to achieve
   operational outcomes for the system, subsystem, and components.
   6.5.3. For MDAPs, the sustainment KPP establishes a set of sustainment metrics that must
   be reported quarterly to OSD using the Defense Acquisition Management Information
   Retrieval (DAMIR) system. The LCSP shall include sustainment KPP/KSA thresholds and
   methods for calculation.
6.6. Product Support Business Case Analysis. The PM shall perform a product support BCA
to validate the product support strategy is cost effective, financially feasible, and optimizes
system readiness. The product support BCA is required for ACAT I, IA, and II programs but is
at the discretion of the MDA for ACAT III programs. The PM shall document the strategy
decision and rationale in the LCSP. The PM shall maintain a complete history of BCAs over the
course of the system life cycle to track decisions and understand how real-world operations cause
program impacts. The PM revalidates the business case prior to any change in the product
support strategy or every five years, whichever occurs first. AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis,
AFI 65-509, Business Case Analysis, and the DoD Product Support Business Case Analysis
Guidebook for specific instructions on business case analysis.
6.7. Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). The LCSP is the program’s product support
execution plan for ensuring the system’s product support achieves and maintains the sustainment
KPP/KSAs while controlling overall program ownership costs. The LCSP shall be integrated
across the system life cycle into strategies, planning, implementation, development, production,
fielding, support, and disposal. The LCSP streamlines, consolidates, and makes visible to
leadership all product support aspects of the program.
   6.7.1. The LCSP is required for all ACAT programs for MS A, B, and C, and FRP. AFMC
   and AFSPC may also designate other efforts requiring the development of an LCSP. The
   LCSP is continuously updated to reflect changes in sustainment strategy, operating
   environments, Post- IOC Sustainment Reviews, and at a minimum every five years.
   6.7.2. ASD(L&MR) shall approve LCSPs for all ACAT ID and USD(AT&L)-designated
   special interest programs. The MDA is the approval authority for all other LCSPs.
   Concurrence from AFMC or AFSPC as the Sustainment Command can be delegated to the
   appropriate level.
   6.7.3. The LCSP shall be developed and coordinated in accordance with the OSD approved
   template.   Tailoring strategies shall ensure that the information and coordination
   requirements of the LCSP are addressed in any integrated documentation.
   6.7.4. The PSM shall take measures to ensure competition or the option of competition, at
   both the prime and subcontract level throughout the program life cycle. To facilitate
   opportunities for competition, the PSM shall encourage use of open architectures to enable
   competition upgrades, build-to-print approaches to enable production through multiple
   sources, acquisition of technical data packages, acquisition of support equipment, periodic
   competition for sub-system upgrades, and licensing of additional suppliers. It is an
   evolutionary program document begun during the first entry phase of the program after the
   Materiel Development Decision (MDD) as the strategic planning framework for obtaining
   optimal sustainment at minimal life cycle cost.
 72                                                       AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   6.7.5. The LCSP evolves into an execution plan for how life cycle sustainment requirements
   are acquired, fielded, applied, managed, assessed, measured, and reported after system
   fielding. By MS C, it details how the program will meet readiness targets; sustain system
   performance capability threshold criteria; mitigate operations and support (O&S) costs,
   supply chain risks, and corrosion; reduce the logistics footprint; and comply with
   environmental and other logistics related regulations. When the program enters the
   Operations and Support Phase, the LCSP is the execution plan for sustaining the system.
   When the Program nears the end of its life cycle, the LCSP is the execution plan for retiring,
   demilitarizing, and disposing of the system.
   6.7.6. Major system modifications/upgrades may be added as a stand-alone annex to the
   LCSP. The annex will address all standard LCSP requirements for that specific
   modification/upgrade. Upon completion of the modification/upgrade, the basic LCSP will be
   updated to incorporate the changes. Each modification or upgrade will have a separate annex
   to the LCSP.
   6.7.7. For more information on the LCSP refer to the PSM Guidebook and Integrated
   Product Support Element Guidebook.
6.8. Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM). The DPEM Program provides a
mechanism to collectively identify, plan, program, negotiate, and budget for depot-level
maintenance services provided by organic AF depots, depots of other Services, and contract
repair sources. Refer to AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management, for detailed information
on DPEM.
6.9. Depot Source of Repair (DSOR). The DSOR process is the method by which the DoD
postures its depot level maintenance workloads – organic or contract. It applies to workloads for
hardware, software, new acquisitions, and fielded systems whether the Government or private
contractor manages the system or subsystem. For fielded systems, the process will be initiated as
soon as a change in posture is considered. For more information on the DSOR process, refer to
AFMCI 21-150 (when published) or AFSPCI 21-135 (when published), as applicable.
   6.9.1. The PM shall initiate DSOR planning early in the life cycle and document DSOR
   planning in the LCSP.
   6.9.2. The PM shall ensure DSOR Determinations for programs, systems, sub-systems, and
   end items are processed and approved through AFMC.
   6.9.3. AFMC acts as the AF executive manager for DSOR.
       6.9.3.1. Special access programs will complete the DSOR Determination Process using
       the classified process defined by AFMC.
       6.9.3.2. DSOR determinations for Space/Cyber programs, systems, sub-systems and end
       items will be routed through AFSPC prior to submission to AFMC.
   6.9.4. The DSOR Determination Process is comprised of several activities, each tied to
   specific events in the acquisition life cycle.
       6.9.4.1. Core Applicability Analysis. The PM shall collaborate with AFMC to determine
       the applicability of core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities to the program.
       This analysis shall be completed prior to MS A, and the results of the analysis shall also
       be documented in the Core Logistics Analysis Annex to the LCSP.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                             73


     6.9.4.2. DSOR. The DSOR is an estimate of requirements for core depot-level
     maintenance and repair capabilities, the associated logistics capabilities, and the
     sustaining workloads necessary to support these requirements. The DSOR shall be
     completed by MS B, and it shall identify sources of repair for each depot level reparable
     at the system and sub-system level at a minimum.
         6.9.4.2.1. As soon as practical after MS A, the PM shall request a DSOR from
         AFMC, ensuring sufficient time is available for the DSOR to be completed by MS B.
         The PM shall provide AFMC with all required data needed to develop the DSOR.
         When the DSOR is completed, the PM shall also document the DSOR in the LCSP.
         6.9.4.2.2. Prior to MS-B, AFMC shall develop a DSOR, coordinate it with the other
         DoD components, issue a DSOR decision documenting the results of the coordinated
         DSOR, and provide a copy of the DSOR decision to the PM.
     6.9.4.3. DSOR review at CDR +90 Days. This review is a validation and update of the
     MS-B DSOR for each depot level reparable at the system and sub-system level of
     indenture. Both AFMC and the applicable PM shall participate in the DSOR CDR+90
     review.
         6.9.4.3.1. The PM is responsible for validating and implementing the DSOR
         CDR+90 review, as well as documenting the results as part of the LCSP.
  6.9.5. The DSOR decision shall be reviewed:
     6.9.5.1. At MS-C and the FRP Decision.
     6.9.5.2. Every five years to document continued validity of the DSOR in the DSOR
     Automated Management System.
     6.9.5.3. As requested by AFMC or AFSPC as applicable.
  6.9.6. The PM shall inform the MDA and AFMC (and AFSPC for Space systems) if
  programmatic changes will dictate a change in the DSOR or Depot activation plan.
  6.9.7. There are five situations when a DSOR is required:
     6.9.7.1. New acquisitions. A new acquisition includes any system, item, component,
     system, subsystem, or software that will result in a new requirement for depot-level
     maintenance. DSORs for new acquisitions shall be accomplished on the total anticipated
     inventory to be acquired. For new acquisitions, the DSOR requirements shall be initiated
     no later than the Technology Development Phase and in sufficient time to obtain a DSOR
     decision for inclusion into the AS.
     6.9.7.2. New work. New work, as related to requiring a DSOR, is a change (hardware or
     software) to a previously postured system, sub-system, end-item, or component that will
     result in a change greater than 20% to the depot maintenance workload hours or cost.
     6.9.7.3. Modifications installation and Follow-on Workloads. Modifications installation
     (as defined in AFI 63-131) and modification follow-on workloads (depot-level
     maintenance workloads generated as a result of a modification installation) require a
     DSOR to be accomplished.
74                                                     AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


     6.9.7.4. Overseas Workload Program (OWLP). DSORs are required for any SOR that
     involves the potential for accomplishment of depot-level maintenance by a source outside
     of the United States. DSOR packages will be prepared and submitted in the same manner
     as for new acquisition packages. This is applicable even in those instances where the
     results of the assessments appear to be obvious.
     6.9.7.5. Workload Shifts. Permanent change in the officially designated SOR or source
     of modification can only be accomplished through a DSOR process when such change
     involves an organic depot. A DSOR is required for a workload shift when there is a
     proposed change in the Source of Repair (SOR) that results in one of the following types
     of SOR shifts: from assigned organic depot to another organic depot; from assigned
     organic depot to a contract; or from contract SOR to an organic depot. Changes from one
     contract repair source to another or consolidating several contract workloads does not
     require a DSOR.
  6.9.8. There is no waiver to the DSOR for depot-level maintenance workloads meeting the
  criteria above; however, there are certain categories of workloads which may be excluded
  from DSOR requirements. DSOR submissions should identify depot maintenance workloads
  which meet identified exclusion criteria. Categories of workloads meeting the exclusion
  criteria include:
     6.9.8.1. Workloads generated by Industrial Plant Equipment located exclusively within
     the depot maintenance complex and funded through the industrial fund.
     6.9.8.2. Modifications that are to be performed in conjunction with scheduled depot
     maintenance at the assigned SOR.
     6.9.8.3. Modifications to components that do not change the form, fit, function, or
     integration of the component modified and do not change the basic part number, only the
     version (dash number change), as long as the SOR of the end-item does not change.
     6.9.8.4. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs.
     6.9.8.5. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) workloads which are
     Major Force Program (MFP)-11 funded.
     6.9.8.6. Automated data processing equipment workloads that are not for national
     security systems (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
     applications).
     6.9.8.7. Department of Energy special design military spares. (Examples include but are
     not limited to nuclear weapon trainers, nuclear weapons test and evaluation or handling
     equipment, and use control equipment.)
     6.9.8.8. Medical Equipment. Management and sustainment for medical materiel for
     peacetime and wartime support is established under the Air Force Medical Support
     Agency as prescribed in AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs.
     Examples of medical equipment exclusions include field intravenous fluid reconstitution
     and deployable oxygen systems.
     6.9.8.9. TPS software when the cost, capability, and hours are included in the DSOR for
     its associated hardware (unit under test).
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                  75


   6.9.9. Depot Activation. Depot activation, planning and budgeting should begin as early as
   practicable in the acquisition cycle. Investments shall be limited to long lead time items such
   as technical data rights and special equipment, and shall not include Military Construction
   until a DSOR has been completed. Prior to MS B, the PM shall have an initial plan for depot
   activation that includes requirements, funding, and operational rationale. The initial plan will
   evolve into the formal Depot Maintenance Activation Plan and shall be continually updated
   until the depot is activated. Data shall be kept current and reported until all depot activation
   requirements are achieved.
6.10. Contractor Logistics Support. The PM will consider Contractor Logistics Support
(CLS) applications as part of the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan. Specific funding guidance cannot
cover all contracts or situations; therefore, the PM, with assistance from and advice of the
Financial Management organization, must review each proposed contractual action as described
in AFI 65-601V1.
   6.10.1. Interim Contract Support (ICS) is a temporary support method for an initial period of
   the operation of the system, equipment, or end-item. This strategy is utilized for controlling
   capital investment costs while design stability is being achieved and complex product support
   elements are being developed.
       6.10.1.1. If ICS is planned, the PM shall ensure the AS and LCSP include a plan for
       transition from ICS to organic or CLS or a combination of contract and organic support
       and identify the beginning and ending dates of the ICS. ICS does not negate the PM’s
       responsibility to achieve an organic, CLS or a Public Private Partnership capability as
       early as practicable or the requirement for testing and evaluation and/or demonstrating
       the adequacy of a system, equipment, or end-item.
       6.10.1.2. The lead command and using commands will plan and advocate for
       programming and budgeting for ICS cost and associated requirements for the sustainment
       of systems.
   6.10.2. CLS and other support requirements shall be programmed for and executed using the
   types of funds and funding level approved by the lead command and/or AF Centralized Asset
   Management (CAM) Executive Agent, AFMC. The PM shall provide the lead command
   and/or AF CAM Executive Agent applicable copies of obligation documents and expense
   reports as agreed to or as stipulated by the AF CAM Executive Agent. NOTE: Air National
   Guard, AF Reserve Command, AF Space Command, AF Weather Agency and AF Flight
   Standards Agency utilize CAM processes and schedules, but manage their own requirements
   validation and execution of funds. Reference AFI 65-601, Vol 1 for more information.
       6.10.2.1. The lead command and using commands will plan and advocate for
       programming and budgeting for their portions of the CLS costs and any associated CLS
       requirements for the sustainment of systems.
   6.10.3. CLS contracts will be written based on characteristics for performance based
   logistics. The PM shall establish flexible performance and funding ranges commensurate
   with targets developed in conjunction with the lead command, industry partners, and other
   relevant agencies across the acquisition, logistics, and user communities. These contracts
   will link contract incentives to performance outcomes while allowing the Air Force to make
 76                                                         AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


   sound, enterprise-wide, capabilities-based resource decisions when deciding where to accept
   risk.
       6.10.3.1. CLS contracts shall be crafted to identify ranges of outcome performance with
       thresholds and objectives and the target price (cost to the user) for each level of capability
       to the extent practical. The contract shall reflect normal operations and delineate any
       constraints or boundary conditions. CLS contracts shall be flexible enough to address a
       range of support requirements to accommodate changes in operational tempo
       (OPTEMPO) or execution year funding including surge or contingency requirements to
       the extent that they can be defined. The PM shall document the thresholds, objectives,
       and target price in the LCSP.
       6.10.3.2. The PM, in collaboration with stakeholders, shall identify needed CLS
       requirements and make provisions within regulation in the RFP, Statement of Work
       (SOW), and contracts to ensure visibility of direct contractor costs for each type of
       support material and service that is being provided.
           6.10.3.2.1. The PM shall implement contract data requirements for tracking and
           reporting of total program cost and breakout of depot-level maintenance contractor
           and organic (50/50) costs.
           6.10.3.2.2. The PM shall report all contract logistics support costs by AFCAIG
           element in accordance with AFI 65-601, Vol. 1.
   6.10.4. The PM shall coordinate and obtain MAJCOM agreement on unit, base, or
   MAJCOM support requirements and ensure the agreed-to support requirements are included
   in the CLS contract. Reference AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures, for additional
   information.
   6.10.5. The PM shall obtain the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) PGM
   approval prior to contracting for commercial calibration services or when deviating from
   currently established calibration support plans IAW AFI 21-113.
   6.10.6. The PM shall review the requirements in DoDI 3020.41, Operational Contract
   Support (OCS) when making logistics sustainability decisions regarding contract support in
   contingency operations outside the United States.
   6.10.7. CLS for commercial derivative/hybrid aircraft shall adhere to Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) maintenance standards, directives, and bulletins to the maximum
   extent practical for commercial derivative aircraft, IAW respective manufacturer’s
   maintenance manuals, military technical manuals, approved maintenance concept, and the
   maintenance contract. For further information, see AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management and AFPD 62-6, USAF Airworthiness. OSS&E product baseline
   shall be preserved. Support for Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) shall
   adhere to the requirements of AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
6.11. Public-Private Partnerships. Public-Private Partnerships are a logistics sustainment
philosophy involving a cooperative agreement between DoD and private sector entities. The
purpose of public-private partnerships is to leverage the optimal capabilities of both the public
and private sectors in order to enhance depot support to the warfighter.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                 77


  6.11.1. The PM shall identify potential public-private partnerships as early as possible in the
  acquisition life cycle. New systems that are establishing their support concept shall require
  consideration of public-private partnerships in the RFP for the EMD Phase. Fielded systems
  changing their depot maintenance support shall proactively consider use of the organic
  depots as part of a public-private partnerships strategy. Public-private partnerships strategies
  shall be included in life cycle planning and presented as part of acquisition and product
  support strategies.
  6.11.2. A BCA shall be prepared prior to approval of specific workload under public-private
  partnerships which at a minimum shall include the analysis of cost/benefits, 50/50, and Core
  workload requirements.
  6.11.3. The PM shall capture cost data for all factors of production related to public-private
  partnerships (e.g., direct labor, overhead, materiel, G&A). The cost data shall be quantifiable
  and measurable utilizing generally accepted accounting practices.
  6.11.4. The PM in collaboration with the Enterprise Repair Manager (ERM), candidate
  depots, lead and using commands, and other stakeholders will develop a depot maintenance
  strategy that addresses both the requirement to conduct organic repair and to pursue a public-
  private partnerships approach where feasible.
  6.11.5. There are three types of public-private partnerships: direct sales agreement (DSA),
  work share arrangement, and leases.
     6.11.5.1. In a DSA dollars flow from the Government buying activity directly to the
     contractor. The contractor in turn funds the depot by funds transfer to the Department of
     Treasury for the goods/services supplied by the depot. Those funds received for work
     performed in support of public-private partnerships are credited to the depot’s Working
     Capital Fund rather than getting deposited into a general US fund account. The
     contractor may also supply materiel to the depots in support of the public-private
     partnerships.
     6.11.5.2. A work share is a partnership where the buying activity determines the best mix
     of work that capitalizes on each partner’s capabilities. The workload is then shared
     between the contractor and the organic repair entity. The contractor is funded through a
     contract, and the organic depot is funded through a project order. The partnering
     arrangement between the organic repair entity and contractor focuses on the roles and
     responsibilities of each partner, and both jointly work to accomplish the overall
     requirement.
     6.11.5.3. Leases allow private industry access to facilities/equipment located at a Center
     of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE). Facilities or equipment located at a CITE
     may be made available to private industry to perform maintenance or produce goods, as
     long as it does not preclude the CITE from performing its mission. The goal is to make
     those Government owned facilities more efficient and ensure that a workforce with the
     necessary manufacturing and maintenance skills are available to meet the needs of the
     armed forces.
  6.11.6. The PM shall include the basis for selecting a DSA partnership arrangement in the
  LCSP. The PM will use BCA evaluations of DSA arrangements and associated pass through
  cost to support decisions related to the continued benefit of contract pass through cost.
 78                                                        AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013


6.12. Data and Data Rights. The PM shall assess long term data and data rights requirements
and corresponding acquisition strategies prior to initiating a RFP to acquire systems, subsystems,
or end-items to ensure they provide for rights, access, or delivery of data that the Government
requires for systems sustainment and to maintain competition throughout the life cycle. The PM
shall address the data rights strategy including the rationale for acquisition and\or non-
acquisition of data and data rights at milestones, ASPs, and reviews and shall document the
strategy in the Technical Data Rights Strategy and associated data planning documents. The
Technical Data Rights Strategy is integrated within the AS and is required for all ACAT
programs. Source selections shall consider Government rights to data and include pricing
options that correspond to the data and data rights recommended as part of the data strategy. The
burden of proof that data is proprietary lies with the contractor. If not acquiring technical data,
computer software licenses, or associated intellectual property rights necessary for organic
support, a summary of the business case analysis justifying that decision must be approved by
the MDA. The PM shall obtain legal counsel when addressing Data Rights or Intellectual
Property issues. The PM shall review the government requirement for technical data throughout
the life cycle of the system.
   6.12.1. The PM shall ensure the program data rights strategy, including the performance
   work statement (PWS) or SOW for development, production, deployment, and sustainment
   (for all applicable phases) includes appropriate data rights requirements, access, and
   necessary deliverables, or options for data and equipment deliverables required to support:
       6.12.1.1. Organic source of repair and/or supply decisions.
       6.12.1.2. Government Core depot maintenance capability requirements.
       6.12.1.3. Expeditionary logistics footprint requirements.
       6.12.1.4. Engineering data requirements needed for such activities as OSS&E assurance,
       integrity programs, sustaining engineering, reliability management, and configuration
       management.
       6.12.1.5. Technical orders (TOs).
       6.12.1.6. Reprocurement/modification/upgrade.
       6.12.1.7. Demilitarization/Disposal.
       6.12.1.8. Open architecture.
       6.12.1.9. Information assurance strategies.
       6.12.1.10. Technology refreshment or enhancement.
       6.12.1.11. Training and training program information.
       6.12.1.12. Spare parts procurement
       6.12.1.13. Testing and Evaluation
       6.12.1.14. Intelligence Mission Data production
       6.12.1.15. Contractor Logistics Support
   6.12.2. For specific guidance and regulations concerning minimum government specific
   license rights, technical data, and computer software follow the regulations and guidance
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                79


   found in DFARS 227.71 and 227.72. (For more information, reference 10 USC §2302, 2304,
   2305, 2320, and 2321), and the Product Data Acquisition web site.
   6.12.3. Computer Software/Firmware. Computer software/firmware means computer
   programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms,
   UML use case, and processes, flow charts/sequence diagram, formulae, and related material
   that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer
   software does not include computer databases or computer software documentation
   (considered technical data).
       6.12.3.1. PMs shall ensure that computer software is acquired as executable code and
       source code unless documented and approved by MDA. When the contractor is
       unwilling to provide source code as a deliverable, the PM shall consider software escrow
       arrangements using mutually agreed to third-party escrow agents.
       6.12.3.2. Software Transition Plan. The PM shall provide the PCO with the software
       plan provisions for inclusion into the RFP, which identify the hardware, software and
       other resources needed for life cycle support of deliverable software and describes the
       developer’s plans for transitioning deliverable items necessary for software sustainment
       to the Air Force.
       6.12.3.3. The Technical Data Rights Strategy must address the potential for changes in
       computer software sustainment over the life cycle of the system or subsystem. RFPs and
       contracts should contain deferred ordering provisions, when a firm requirement for a
       particular computer software item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but
       there is a potential need, e.g., organic sustainment, for the data.
   6.12.4. Life Cycle Management of Digital Product Design Data. PMs that generate digital
   product design data or require delivery of contractor-generated digital product design data as
   part of the program’s data strategy shall:
       6.12.4.1. Utilize MIL-STD-31000, Technical Data Packages, to structure contract

6.14. Serialized Item Management (SIM). The purpose of SIM is to improve the AF’s
capability to manage materiel through the generation, collection, and analysis of data on
individual assets in order to enhance asset visibility and financial accountability and to improve
system life cycle management. SIM is enabled through Item Unique Identification (IUID),
automatic identification technology (AIT), and automated information systems (AIS). IUID is
the assignment and marking of individual assets with a standardized, machine-readable, two-
dimensional marking containing a globally unique and unambiguous item identifier. AIT is the
technology used to scan the marking at points within the supply chain to identify discrete
transactions of an asset as well as transmit the data collected from these transactions to AIS. AIS
store and process the data so it can be used to make informed decisions concerning the
management of the asset or the system. Reference DoDD 8320.03, Unique Identification (UID)
Standards for a Net-Centric Department of Defense, DoDI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification
(IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property, DoD Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items, and
DoDI 4151.19, Serialized Item Management (SIM) for Materiel Maintenance, for additional
guidance.

   established. The PM includes the approved IUID Implementation Plan as a link or an
   attachment in the Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) for design consideration.
   6.15.3. Individual IUID Implementation Plans are not required for sustainment activities
   marking installed legacy assets. Sustainment Work Center/Cost Center supervisors shall
   incorporate planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of IUID requirements for
   legacy assets into day-to-day workload planning and scheduling based on planned
   workflows, technical documentation and specifications. This includes registration in the
   DoD IUID registry.
   6.15.4. Special Interest IUID requirements:
       6.15.4.1. Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM). All individual NWRM items are
       accounted for and managed by serial number. This will include the assignment of a
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                                83


       Unique item Identifier. Consistent with engineering analysis, individual NWRM items in
       the DoD Supply System will be marked with a machine readable Unique Item Identifier
       or assigned a virtual Unique Item Identifier.
       6.15.4.2. Government Furnished Property.       The PM will identify all required
       Government Furnished Property addressed in the Systems Engineering plan and other
       program documentation. The PM working with the PCO will ensure the clause at
       DFARS 252.211-7007 is included in all new contracts involving assets for which the
       government has Title (owned by the AF) and is in the possession of contractors. The
       overarching guidance for Government Furnished Property management is contained in
       FAR Part 45 and DoDI 8320.04. The contract also specifies the requirements for
       property accountability in the Accountable Property System of Record as described in
       DoDI 5000.64.
       6.15.4.3. Tooling. The PM will ensure MDAP Unique tooling associated with the

   Registry.
   6.15.7. Program planning for AIT infrastructure requirements and/or AIS enhancements to
   include IUID should occur only if the program is responsible for the management and/or
   maintenance of AIT and/or AIS.
6.16. Industrial Base Constraints. All programs shall identify and manage industrial base
constraints throughout all phases of the life cycle, from requirements definition to disposal.
Industrial base constraints include, but are not limited to, critical raw materials, sources of
strategic materials, counterfeit parts, DMSMS, manufacturing technologies and capabilities, the
supply chain, parts obsolescence, depot capacity, and industrial workforce.
   6.16.1. The PM shall address industrial base constraints in the AS and LCSP. This should
   address mitigation to ensure that the system(s) can be supported, upgraded, and updated
   during its life cycle. Open systems design can help manage the risks associated with
   technology obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing capabilities by avoiding being
   locked into proprietary technology or by relying on a single source over the life of a system.
   Incremental development also should be considered to alleviate obsolescence concerns.
   Reference the DoD Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers.
   6.16.2. The PM shall ensure that product support efforts include an active DMSMS process
   to anticipate occurrences and take appropriate actions. The Services and Defense Logistics

300; and the DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Budget
Formulation and Presentation, Chapter 18, Information Technology.
   7.16.1. The PM shall support the input of IT Budget Reporting requirements for all IT
   program resources and information IAW Congressional, OMB, OSD, and Air Force
   guidance. The PM shall report (e.g. FYDP positions, program description, funding change
   description, etc.) applicable IT in the designated AF IT data repository, EITDR, and SNaP-IT
   for CIRs also referred to as Exhibit 300s. The dollars amounts entered must be approved
   budget positions, not funding requirements.
7.17. Management of Defense Business Systems (DBS). The PM shall follow the policies and
processes described in the DoDI 5000.02 for the management of DBS programs. DoDI 5000.02
defines the acquisition and requirements process for DBS, and assigns responsibilities and
provides procedures for the successful development, testing, fielding, and sustainment of DBSs.
This model is a guideline and is not intended to preclude tailoring, consistent with statute and
sound business practice.
   7.17.1. DBS Requirements. Activities performed and documentation required in the
   Business Capability Definition (BCD) Phase of the DoDI 5000.02 guidance shall be used in

         needed to achieve an essential capability, taking into consideration the alternative
         solutions for preventing that adverse effect.
     7.17.3.2. The DBSMC chair is the final approval authority for all defense business
     system certification requests. The Chair shall document decisions in an Investment
     Decision Memorandum to affected PMs through the DoD Component Pre-Certification
     Authorities. DBSMC Chair approval shall occur before the first milestone review of an
     acquisition program. The PM shall include a copy of the DBSMC approved Investment
     Decision Memorandum with the documentation provided to the MDA. A DBSMC
     certification approval does not constitute authority to execute an acquisition program
  7.17.4. DBS Acquisition Reporting. All DBS efforts using investment funds are subject to
  acquisition reporting that is detailed in Chapter 10 of this AFI.
     7.17.4.1. DBS efforts using investment funds, regardless of amount, will be listed on the
     AML.
     7.17.4.2. DBS efforts on the AML shall initiate and maintain program data within the
     SMART acquisition management system. DBS efforts that are managed within AFMC
     and SMC are also required to use Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (CCaR).
     Additionally, DBS efforts with more than $30M in RDT&E (3600) or $50M in
     procurement over the life of the effort are required to submit a Monthly Acquisition
     Report (MAR) via the SMART system.
  7.17.5. DBS Sustainment Reporting. DBS efforts that have reached Full Deployment
  Decision (or equivalent milestone) are not required to submit a MAR. If DBS sustainment
  efforts use investment funding that exceeds the MAR reporting thresholds then the efforts
  will adhere to the reporting requirements in Chapter 10 of this AFI.

        ACQUISITION WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONAL
                           DEVELOPMENT

9.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to identify acquisition workforce management and
professional development requirements and responsibilities. The 1990 Defense Acquisition
Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA), Chapter 87, Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.)/ P.L.
101-510, codified at 10 USC 1701-1764, provides specific minimum qualification standards of
those personnel performing functions integral to the acquisition process and defines Critical
Acquisition Positions (CAPs). The law requires DoD to formalize career paths for personnel
who wish to pursue careers in acquisition to develop a skilled, professional workforce. This
chapter defines the Air Force’s implementation of this law as required by DoDD 5000.52 and
DoDI 5000.66.
9.2. Acquisition Workforce. For the purposes of this publication, the acquisition workforce is
defined as those individuals assigned to positions having predominantly acquisition functions as
defined by DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 5000.02, and DoDD 5000.52. These positions shall be
designated by acquisition coding in the manpower and personnel systems of record.

         9.5.2.8.2. Military: Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 59 will be updated for the
         required tenure outlined in AFI 36-2110; therefore a DD Form 2888 is not required.
  9.5.3. Key Leadership Positions (KLPs). A subset of CAPs that require SAE oversight of
  position qualification requirements and tenure will be designated KLPs. KLPs are
  determined and designated by the SAE. Further guidance on KLPs is outlined in AFI 36-
  1301 and detailed APDP guidance.
     9.5.3.1. Civilian: DD Form 2889 will be used to document the KLP tenure agreement.
     Individuals must sign DD Form 2889 (Block 6a) to capture tenure agreement and

  DoD certification standards without modification. The DACM uses an online certification
  tool to execute the certification process. Acquisition workforce members will request
  certification via the online certification system found on the Career/APDP section in the
  acquisition functional area of the AF Portal. For implementing instructions and POCs, refer
  to the detailed APDP guidance.
     9.5.4.1. Criteria for Manual Certification.          Under exceptional circumstances,
     certifications may be processed manually rather than using the online certification tool.
     As delegated by the DACM, Certifying Officials serve as the AF approval authority for
     issuing acquisition professional certification credentials manually in accordance with
     DoD policy. Certifying Officials are accountable for ensuring current functional area
     education, training, and experience standards are met for certification. The DACM shall

      aligns with their IDP and meeting professional currency is measured in performance
      feedback. Individuals on acquisition-coded positions who fail to meet the professional
      currency requirement are considered non-current. For details on execution of CL, refer to
      the detailed APDP guidance.
      9.5.5.2. Officers who are not CL current as of the Materiel Leader board date are
      ineligible. Civilians who have not achieved the CL standard within a two month period
      after becoming non-current will not be eligible for acquisition Civilian Strategic Leader
      Program positions. In addition, individuals must be CL current to compete for special
      acquisition career development programs or AF acquisition awards unless a waiver is
      granted. For details, refer to the detailed APDP guidance.
      9.5.5.3. Learning is a job responsibility. Online and resident courses required for APDP
      certification and CL may be accomplished during dedicated duty time either during the

      with rank, will not be considered for, or shall be disqualified and removed from, the
      Acquisition Corps.
AFI63-101/20-101 07 MARCH 2013                                                             103


     9.5.6.4. Members of the Acquisition Corps are expected to have recent acquisition
     experience and retainability. Members will be removed from the Acquisition Corps if
     they have not served in an acquisition coded position within the last seven years. In
     addition, Acquisition Corps members who have an approved retirement or date of
     separation and who are not currently serving in an acquisition position will be removed
     from the Acquisition Corps.
  9.5.7. Waivers. DAWIA and DoD policy permit waivers for position qualification
  requirements or tenure requirements on a case-by-case basis when in the best interests of the
  Air Force. Waiver requests, coordination, and approval / disapproval must be processed via
  the AT&L Workforce Waiver Tool. Refer to detailed APDP guidance for further

                 POLICY COORDINATION, REVIEW, AND WAIVERS

11.1. Integrated Life Cycle Management Publication Coordination. Major Command
(MAJCOM) Commanders are requested to convene a high performance team (HPT)-based
process for the review and coordination of official ILCM Air Force departmental publications
(e.g., AFPDs, AFIs, AFMANs, and AFPAMS). These publications are the authoritative voice of
the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) and document how ILCM requirements established by law,
the President, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), and the SECAF are to be fulfilled.
   11.1.1. The HPT shall consist of the appropriate subject matter expertise relevant to the
   content of the publication under review. The purpose of the HPT is to facilitate AFI 33-360,
   Publications and Forms Management, technical/functional staffing in order to develop a
   timely, adjudicated, consolidated and integrated position on behalf of the MAJCOM
   Commander. Additionally, the HPT will review the publication with regards to higher
   authority (e.g., public law, statute, DoD issuances), HAF senior leadership direction, and the
   ability to implement a standardized process across the MAJCOM. The HPT will provide
   recommendations and supporting rationale for all comments to increase the quality of the
   ILCM publication.
   11.1.2. MAJCOM Commanders will assign a lead office responsible for staffing,
   identification of relevant subject matter experts and process owners to support the HPT, and
   act as the single point of contact between the MAJCOM and the HAF publication OPR.
   MAJCOM Commanders can designate a lower-level office to provide the response and sign
   off on the coordination form, but are responsible for ensuring the correct offices within their
   organization review the publication.
11.2. Waivers. Waivers from guidance must be based on a programmatic course of action
approved by the SAE or MDA through the program’s governance chain of authority and
documented in the appropriate program documentation. If a waiver is required, the waiver
request should be submitted to the publication OPR for appropriate staffing and approval among
HAF functional authorities.

11.3. Changes. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
SAF/AQXA using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF
Form 847s from the field through the functional chain of command.
