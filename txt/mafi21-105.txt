                                          Chapter 3

     AIRCRAFT STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE AND CORROSION CONTROL
                         PROGRAM (2A7X3)

3.1. Corrosion Control Philosophy.
   3.1.1. Corrosion has a direct impact on the readiness of Air Force systems. It must be
   prevented, identified, and repaired as prudently as possible.
   3.1.2. Corrosion minimization on Air Force aircraft and ground equipment is the direct
   responsibility of all users and maintainers. Due consideration must be given to corrosion
   prevention during all planning, operation, and maintenance actions.
   3.1.3. The AMC corrosion management program is oriented towards prevention. This is
   accomplished through equipment cleaning, maintenance of protective coatings, and early
   detection and treatment of corrosion. Strict adherence to corrosion prevention policies and
   technical orders is essential.
   3.1.4. All aircraft and ground equipment users and maintainers must attend periodic
   corrosion prevention and identification training as per section 3.19.1 of this instruction.
   Awareness is the key to an effective corrosion management program.
3.2. Policies and Procedures.
   3.2.1. Cross flow of information is essential for a successful program. All program managers
   are authorized direct communication with their counterparts (MAJCOM and ALC program
   managers) on any matter pertaining to the AMC corrosion management program, within the
   parameters of local chain-of-command policies.
   3.2.2. All maintenance and operations personnel, regardless of AFSC, are responsible to
   document potentially corroded structures/components on the proper maintenance forms. The
   structural maintenance work center evaluates corrosion discrepancies to determine proper
   treatment or repair. The list of publications in Attachment 1 is provided to ensure personnel
   are aware of applicable procedural documents.
   3.2.3. It is not economically feasible to remove corrosion from common hardware (screws,
   nuts, etc.), therefore, replace corroded hardware as necessary in accordance with applicable
   technical data.
3.3. Protective Coating Maintenance:
   3.3.1. Maintenance painting is defined as the application of coatings to aerospace equipment
   where the existing coating system is deteriorated or missing. Maintenance painting must be
   kept to a minimum and must comply with federal, state, and local environmental regulations.
   Maintenance painting of aircraft accomplished solely for cosmetics is highly discouraged
   because of environmental and coating thickness restrictions.
       3.3.1.1. All touch-up painting will be accomplished from seam-to-seam, and will be
       masked at the edges. Where a seam is not reasonably accessible, a “simulated” seam may
       be created. No unmasked spray touch-up is authorized.
 10                          MOBILITYAIRFORCEINSTRUCTION21-105 22 MAY 2014


          3.3.1.1.1. Atomized spray, paint brushing, and rolling are authorized methods for
          paint/primer application. Units limited by local environmental restrictions should
          maximize the use of brushing and rolling techniques. Coating film thickness must be
          carefully monitored when using these methods.
      3.3.1.2. Units equipped with environmentally compliant aircraft painting facilities and
      adequate manpower may perform complete overcoating of aircraft with command/A4M
      approval.
      3.3.1.3. Aircraft paint data placards must not be permanently removed. When complete
      overcoats are accomplished, the paint data on the old placard will be annotated on the
      AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, and a new placard with new data will be
      applied.
          3.3.1.3.1. All full scuff sanded and overcoated aircraft require an additional paint
          identification block for each coating system applied (in addition to the original paint
          identification block for each coating system applied ) per TO 1-1-8.
      3.3.1.4. When large portions of aircraft are repainted (i.e. full wing, large portions of
      fuselage, flight controls, etc.), the AFTO Form 95 will be annotated with type of paint
      and exact location.
          3.3.1.4.1. When large sections are repainted refer to applicable weapon system TO
          for potential Weight and Balance (W&B) requirements.
3.4. MAJCOM/A4M, Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. Manage the command's ASM and corrosion control program. Office of primary
   responsibility (OPR) for providing oversight and ensuring AMC has viable aircraft and
   ground equipment corrosion management program.
   3.4.2. Designate a SNCO to manage the program and perform the following responsibilities:
      3.4.2.1. Manage the ASM program for Command.
      3.4.2.2. Serve as the Command Corrosion Control Manager.
      3.4.2.3. Support AF Corrosion Control Prevention Executive (CCPE) by participating in
      working groups, advisory boards and providing corrosion data for the annual corrosion
      report.
      3.4.2.4. Support Air Force Corrosion Prevention and Control Office (AFCPCO) by
      participating in equipment evaluations, corrosion program managers meetings, advisory
      boards, executive council meetings, and field surveys.
          3.4.2.4.1. Coordinate with the Air Force Corrosion Prevention Control Office in
          selection and accomplishment of command Corrosion Survey at a minimum of every
          5 years.

           (AGE) is scheduled to deploy, they must ensure aircraft and equipment washes are
           considered prior to mission deployment. If a wash was recently accomplished, the
           owning organization maintenance supervision will determine whether another wash is
           necessary prior to deployment.
           3.17.1.2.2. If deployed to a location where wash capability does not exist and a wash
           is due, enter a red dash in the AFTO form 781A stating, “Aircraft wash required upon
           return to home station.” If a deployed aircraft exceeds the wash due date by more than
           30 days, inform the AMC Corrosion Manager.
           3.17.1.2.3. When an aircraft flies over salt water below 3,000 feet, the aircrew
           debriefing record and AFTO Form 781A will be annotated with a “NOTE”. See TO
           1-1-691 for complete guidance. Aircraft properly rinsed in taxi-through, or “bird
           bath” type facilities, need not comply with this requirement.
   3.17.2. Aircraft latrine/urinal areas must be cleaned thoroughly to avoid corrosion damage
   due to effluent contamination.
   3.17.3. Interior areas will be dried after washing. Any method, such as low-pressure air, low
   temperature heat, or sponging/mopping, may be used. Standing water in any interior area of
   the aircraft must be removed.
   3.17.4. Pressurized water washing equipment may be used for aircraft washing IAW TO 1-
   1-691 and manufacturer’s instructions. However, all surfaces must be agitated with an
   authorized pad or other article. Pressure washing alone will not adequately remove
   contaminants from painted surfaces.

   training will consist of the Aircraft Corrosion Control video or Corrosion and Prevention
   (I3ADU00TCB0002) IMI downloadable from https://a4mxtng.csd.disa.mil. AFSC 2A7X3
   (structural maintenance) personnel are exempt from periodic corrosion familiarization
   training. En-route personnel must accomplish the IMI but are exempt from the supplemental
   training.
   3.19.2. If group block training method is used, supplemental training is conducted by the
   corrosion manager or designated representative holding a primary AFSC of 2A7X3 or
   2A790. If block or refresher training is done on an individual basis, the supplemental training
   should be self-supporting; such as a short video, PowerPoint presentation, or other medium
   that the individual can review.
   3.19.3. The corrosion manager, in conjunction with the unit maintenance-training manager,
   develops formal classroom training curriculum. As a minimum, the curriculum will include:
      3.19.3.1. Corrosion identification procedures and techniques using the most current
      available Air Force aircraft corrosion visual training aids and information.
      3.19.3.2. Identification of corrosion prone areas on unit specific weapon systems and
      equipment.
      3.19.3.3. Reporting and documentation procedures for identified corrosion.
      3.19.3.4. Importance of proper selection and use of sealants, corrosion preventive
      compounds (CPC), and lubricants.
      3.19.3.5. Proper selection and use of all cleaning materials.
   3.19.4. The corrosion manager periodically updates training material and information with
   the assistance of the unit maintenance training manager and information gained from CPABs
   and corrosion manager’s conferences.

   3.19.5. Periodic corrosion training does not replace normal on-the-job training (OJT)
   requirements in any career field.
3.20. Unit Corrosion Control Program Requirements.
   3.20.1. Owning activities shall wash and clean their aircraft and support equipment.
   3.20.2. Wing Corrosion Program Manager and/or ASM personnel will assist the owning
   activities in their corrosion prevention efforts by accomplishing scheduled corrosion
   inspections on aircraft, support, and test equipment.
   3.20.3. Only Aircraft Structural Maintenance personnel shall perform aircraft inspection
   work cards specified for accomplishment by Aircraft Structural Maintenance in the -6 T.O.
   All maintenance personnel, regardless of AFSC, shall examine parts they remove and inspect
   the inside of all exposed areas for corrosion.
   3.20.4. Maintenance personnel who remove/install aircraft panels and doors must ensure
   seals are serviceable and sealant applied to panels and fasteners as specified in applicable
   aircraft technical orders.
   3.20.5. Maintenance personnel shall report all corrosion deficiencies through the applicable
   MIS IAW 00-20 series technical orders. Accurate documentation of maintenance actions in
   support of the corrosion control program is essential to support future manning, equipment
   requirements, training and parts/material procurement requirements.

                             AIRCRAFT MARKING POLICY

5.1. Paint Schemes/Configurations and USAF Standard Markings.
5.1.1. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard markings will be applied in
accordance with the applicable aircraft technical order, aircraft drawings, TO 1-1-8,
Application of Organic Coatings and this instruction. All aircraft markings will be maintained
intact, legible, and distinct in color (not faded). Command standardization of markings (by
mission design and series (MDS)) is of primary concern.
5.2. Standard Markings Deviations.
   5.2.1. Deviations from standard markings are authorized for 89 AW aircraft when approved
   by HQ USAF.
5.3. Exterior Markings / Coatings.
   5.3.1. All aircraft markings will be maintained intact, legible, and distinct in color (not
   faded). Command standardization of markings (by mission design and series (MDS)) is of
   primary concern.
   5.3.2. All exterior aircraft markings must match the gloss level of the basecoat. No approved
   diffuse clearcoats are available; low-gloss materials must be used for all markings on aircraft
   with lusterless paint schemes.
   5.3.3. Operational markings and structural coating/corrosion maintenance will take
   precedence over cosmetic refinements; markings, such as nose art, tail flash, and DCC names
   should be considered lowest priority work.
   5.3.4. When large sections of an aircraft are repainted (i.e. entire wing, fuselage, or
   empennage) they will be documented in applicable MIS and the individual AFTO Form 95,
   Significant Historical Data for tracking purposes.
       5.3.4.1. Review applicable weapon system technical data for W&B requirements.
5.4. Aircraft Mandatory Markings
5.4.1. Letters and Numerals. These markings may be applied using any style letter/numeral
(font) deemed appropriate by the wing commander. Size and location must remain standardized
for all wing-assigned aircraft.
   5.4.2. Standard Air Force Markings. Mandatory markings will be applied IAW TO 1-1-8,
   weapon system drawings, if applicable, weapon system specific TO and the applicable table
   in this instruction. Tables A2.1 through A2.10 in attachment 2 list the size, location and
   color of markings by aircraft type. For identification, placement, and color of mandatory
   markings other than those identified in this instruction, refer to the weapon system technical
   orders and system drawings. Deviations from standard markings are authorized for 89 AW
   aircraft when approved by HQ USAF.
