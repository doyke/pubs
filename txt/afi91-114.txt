containing a nuclear warhead is mated to a missile:
   15.1. Except during emergency combat capability (ECC) operations or simulated electronic
   launch tests, at least two LCCs in a squadron must monitor the status of, and be able to
   inhibit, each operational LF in the squadron. If only one LCC can monitor and inhibit, crews
   must begin single LCC operations in accordance with paragraph 17. or have affected LFs
   safed in accordance with paragraph 15.2.
   15.2. If any of the conditions in subparagraphs 15.2.1 through 15.2.4 exist, manually lock
   the affected LFs Safety Control Switch (SCS) in the SAFE position or install the missile
   safing pins until Emergency action procedures (EAP) direct return to a normal configuration:
       15.2.1. An LCC can insert a launch command, the LF can process the command, and no
       other LCC can inhibit and monitor the LF.
       15.2.2. No LCC can prevent Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) aircraft access
       (the ability to insert enable or launch commands) while ALCS access is not authorized.
       15.2.3. A missile cannot respond to an inhibit launch command and the missile is not in
       the standby NO-GO mode or LF NO-GO mode.

       15.2.4. LF status cannot be monitored (LF Status Out or LF Down) unless the LF NO-
       GO mode occurred first.
    15.3. These crewmember procedures apply while on duty in the LCC:
       15.3.1. Two certified missile combat crew officers must be on duty at the same time, one
       of which must be the Missile Combat Crew Commander or the Deputy Missile Combat
       Crew Commander (certified crew member).
       15.3.2. One crewmember at a time may sleep on duty, but both must be awake and
       capable of detecting an unauthorized act if:
           15.3.2.1. The sealed authenticator container is unlocked and authenticators are
           present.
           15.3.2.2. Translate cards (USWAC 410) are opened or code values inserted.
           15.3.2.3. A possible or confirmed code compromise affects the LCC, flight area, or
           squadron.
           15.3.2.4. The integrity of all seals on a component identified in paragraph 9.6 and 9.7
           is lost or in doubt.
           15.3.2.5. The LCC blast door is not secured by at least one of the following methods:

   minutes.
16. Operations Involving Maintenance on an Assembled Weapon System:
   16.1. As soon as possible after personnel enter the launcher, manually safe the LF’s SCS and
   remove the SCS key from the lock pin assembly. The SCS must stay in the SAFE position
   when personnel occupy the launcher, except when the only maintenance being done is
   observing the SCS during SCS tests.
   16.2. Pin all safe and arm devices and arm/disarm devices in the SAFE position before:
      16.2.1. Removing the SCS lock pin during maintenance (except as noted above for SCS
      tests).

      16.3.3. Missile guidance set or propulsion system maintenance except as authorized by
      AFSC/SEW.
      16.3.4. Requirements identified in technical order 21M-LGM30F-12.
   16.4. Do not install a RS on the missile until an operational code has been inserted into the
   command signal decoder (Missile) (CSD (M)) and valid verification number (VN) has been
 10                                                                AFI91-114 25 October 2011


   obtained and matches the VN computed by the WCPS. For downstages with an error in the
   reverify mode, procedures in the 2-1 series technical order may be used in lieu of a
   verification number. Do not remove the operational code in the CSD (M) until the RS has
   been removed from the missile or mechanically and electrically isolated via a SELM test
   wafer.
   16.5. Maintenance during hours of darkness is not prohibited. However, maintenance
   requiring a penetrated LF, occurring after official sunset or before official sunrise must be
   approved by the Maintenance Group Commander or higher.
17. Single Launch Control Center Operations.
   17.1. The installed LCP must be coded only with the operational inhibit code. Dissipate all
   operational launch code data from mechanical code units (MCU). EXCEPTION: During
   predetermined advanced readiness conditions, as specified by EAP or higher headquarters
   directives, missile combat crews (MCCs) need not dissipate operational codes in the single
   LCC; however, begin ECC operations according to paragraph 18. as soon as the situation
   permits.
   17.2. Keep all operational LCPs for the affected squadron under Two-Person Concept
   control or in a secured area requiring Two-Person Concept team access. Keep these LCPs at
   the missile support base until predetermined levels of advanced readiness when EAP or
   higher headquarters directives authorize delivery to the LCC to support ECC operations.
   17.3. A fully programmed spare Head Disk Assembly (HDA) must be available in case of
   failure.
   17.4. The LCC requires continuous Two-Person Concept control (paragraph 15.3.2.6).
18. Emergency Combat Capability Operations: During ECC operations, the rules in
paragraphs 4. through 16. apply, except those in paragraphs 9.7 and 15.1 These rules also apply:
      18.1. Operational LCPs may be taken to, and stored in, the LCC.
   18.2. When operational LCPs are present, two MCCs (four crewmembers in all) must have
   concurrent duty within the LCC. At least two crewmembers must be awake at all times.
   18.3. The installed LCP must be coded only with the operational inhibit code. LCPs with
   operationally coded, launch code MCUs may be installed at predetermined levels of
   advanced readiness as directed by higher headquarters or EAP.
   18.4. Both MCCs must authenticate an execution order before initiating an enable or an
   execute launch command.
   18.5. A fully programmed spare HDA must be available in case of failure.
19. Simulated Electronic Launch-Minuteman (SELM) Tests: During SELM tests, the rules
in paragraph 4. though 16. apply, except those in paragraph 15.1 These rules also apply:
   19.1. RS Removal. Remove the RS from the test LF(s) when:
         19.1.1. Any ordnance item will be expended.
         19.1.2. Only one LCC is used in the test configuration.
AFI91-114 25 October 2011                                                                     11


      19.1.3. An anomaly occurs that is nuclear safety related or increases the possibility of an
      abnormal environment occurring.
   19.2. Isolation Procedures.
      19.2.1. Cable interconnectivity between operational flights must be such that a single
      fault will not result in single LCC control of an operational flight or LF(s).
      19.2.2. Electrically disconnect test LFs and test LCCs from the nontest LFs and LCCs on
      the command circuits of the hardened intersite cable network:
          19.2.2.1. Isolate LCC command lines by removing the corresponding connecting
          links in the LF interconnecting box and installing command-line isolators.
      19.2.3. Maintain operational status interrogation routines in cable mode in the nontest
      portion of the test squadron.
      19.2.4. Verify inhibit command isolation immediately before airborne and ground tests.
   19.3. Codes.
      19.3.1. Administrative controls and procedures must positively distinguish code tapes
      and devices containing test codes from those with operational codes.
      19.3.2. Operational SDU keying variables must be used during SELM tests. Replace all
      other operational codes at test LFs and test LCCs with test codes before SELM testing.
      19.3.3. Install test-coded LCPs in the test LCCs before the last-look inspection.
      19.3.4. For SELM tests involving ALCS use excluded test "X," "Y," and "L" code
      blocks to generate codes installed in test LFs and test LCCs.
   19.4. Commands.
      19.4.1. After the test ALCS aircraft issues the first enable command, determine the status
      of each LF (of the same weapon system) in the MAJCOM. After verifying the nontest
      LFs did not process the enable command, the ALCS aircraft must transmit the inhibit
      launch command and poll the test squadron to ensure that no nontest facility received the
      inhibit launch command.
      19.4.2. If nontest facilities in the MAJCOM respond to test commands, proceed only
      after determining cause and completing necessary corrective actions.
   19.5. Safing Actions.
      19.5.1. Missile safing pins will be installed in all test LFs from SELM posture until
      EWO reposture.
      19.5.2. During the ground test, manually safe any nontest LF in the same squadron for
      which status monitoring is lost.
      19.5.3. Before or during the ALCS test, if status monitoring is lost for any nontest LF in
      the same wing, manually safe that LF. Stop the test until safing is completed. This safing
      requirement applies only to like configurations in wings with multiple system
      configurations.
   19.6. Airborne Launch Control System.
12                                                                  AFI91-114 25 October 2011


     19.6.1. Make sure the test ALCS aircraft transmits only proper commands by verifying:
         19.6.1.1. The coded portable storage unit and volatile keying assemblies (VKA) on
         board the test ALCS aircraft contain only test data.
         19.6.1.2. All commands transmitted from the ALCS aircraft to the test LFs are on the
         frequencies and tones designated for the SELM tests.
  19.7. Status Monitoring.
     19.7.1. For test LFs with an RS, two LCCs in the test squadron must monitor the status
     of and be able to inhibit each such test-configured LF. If less than two LCCs retain the
     ability to monitor or inhibit, stop the test until the condition is corrected.
     19.7.2. For nontest LFs at least two nontest LCCs in the test squadron must be
     operational and able to monitor the status of and inhibit nontest LFs. If less than two
     nontest LCCs retain the ability to monitor or inhibit, stop the test. The remaining nontest
     LCC must begin single LCC operations (paragraph 17.).
     19.7.3. Do not start testing again until the proper number of LCCs are available to
     monitor the status of and inhibit test and nontest LFs.
  19.8. Last-Look Inspection. Before testing, a Two-Person Concept team composed of
  individuals who were not on the maintenance team that configured the test LF must conduct
  a last-look inspection.
     19.8.1. The last-look inspection must verify that personnel:
         19.8.1.1. Disconnected the first-stage ignition branch of the lower umbilical cable
         from the D-Box and capped the branch.
         19.8.1.2. Properly pinned all safe and arm devices and arm/disarm devices, and
         disconnected and capped the RS cable.
         19.8.1.3. Configured the test LF(s) properly.
         19.8.1.4. Removed the missile guidance set battery from the missile.
         19.8.1.5. Installed all command-line isolators properly.
     19.8.2. The last-look inspection must be performed again if the launch tube is
     subsequently penetrated.
     19.8.3. If only the LER is entered after the last-look inspection, another inspection must
     be accomplished to verify that personnel:
         19.8.3.1. Configured the test LF(s) properly.
         19.8.3.2. Removed the missile guidance set battery from the missile.
         19.8.3.3. Installed all command-line isolators properly.
