1. Overview, and Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.1. Overview. This publication establishes command relationships between COMPACAF
     and subordinate commanders during normal steady-state operations, and provides guidance
     on the transition to contingency operations. It sets policy and procedures for establishing and
     documenting Air Force organizations and command relationships for PACAF presentation to
     a joint force commander. For additional perspective, there are several Joint Task Forces and
     subunified commands discussed in this instruction, including US Forces Japan (USFJ), US
     Forces Korea (USFK), Alaska Command (ALCOM), JTF-Support Forces Antarctica (JTF-
     SFA) and JTF-Alaska (JTF-A).
        1.1.1. Effective command relationships, critical to successful force employment, are
        integrally connected to force organization. Unit organization establishes the framework
        for command and determines how missions are executed; hence, every organizational
        decision is a command and control decision, because it establishes the network of
        relationships among commanders.
        1.1.2. Commanders are responsible for effectively communicating to their subordinates
        the organizational structure and command relationships relevant to mission
        accomplishment, good order and discipline.
     1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
        1.2.1. HQ PACAF.
             1.2.1.1. HQ PACAF/A3.
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                      3


           1.2.1.1.1. Coordinate on all Global Force Management (GFM) and AEF taskings
           affecting PACAF forces.
           1.2.1.1.2. Manage deployment of PACAF assigned forces to other GCC AORs.
           1.2.1.1.3. Manage deployments into, and operations in the PACOM AOR.
           1.2.1.1.4. Through the PACAF Crisis Action Team (CAT), appoint a "lead
           functional OPR" for any upcoming contingency in the PACOM AOR . A lead
           functional OPR is appointed to manage coordination with PACOM counterparts,
           deploying forces, receiving bases, and other HQ PACAF functionals, as required,
           and to assist A3 in developing associated PACAF courses of action, operational
           orders, and/or CONOPS. Normally A3 should be the lead functional OPR for
           aircraft deployments, but potentially A4, A6, A7 or another directorate could be a
           lead functional OPR. For large efforts, an Operations Planning Group (OPG)
           should be assembled to provide the necessary level of effort.
           1.2.1.1.5. Publish PACAF contingency and exercise orders after consulting with
           PACAF/A1M regarding unit designations and organization. The EXORD will be
           the source document used by A1M to establish expeditionary units through G-
           series orders.
     1.2.2. HQ PACAF/A1M.
        1.2.2.1. Advise staff concerning organizational structure and unit designation, to
        include expeditionary units.
        1.2.2.2. Publish G-Series orders activating and/or inactivating expeditionary units.
        1.2.2.3. Develop and publish organizational diagrams for expeditionary units.
     1.2.3. HQ PACAF/A5X.
        1.2.3.1. Advise staff on PACAF command relationships and presentation of forces.
        1.2.3.2. Coordinate, review, and assist in development of command relationships in
        plans, operational orders, and other documents.
     1.2.4. PACAF Directors. Lead coordination efforts to properly organize forces under
     applicable director’s purview.
     1.2.5. HQ PACAF/JA.
        1.2.5.1. Advise PACAF staff on UCMJ and other legal responsibilities inherent in or
        assigned through delegated command authority.
        1.2.5.2. Advise PACAF staff on appointment or assumption of command IAW AFI
        51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command.
        1.2.5.3. Coordinate on all G-Series orders activating or inactivating expeditionary
        units.
     1.2.6. 613 AOC.
        1.2.6.1. Recommend options for air mobility support for contingency/wartime
        operations including Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief.
 4                                                              PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


           1.2.6.2. Advise on the pros/cons (justification) for the TACON transfer of PACAF
           air mobility forces to a new JTF versus operating in a supporting role to the new JTF.
           1.2.6.3. Advise on the pros/cons (justification) for the OPCON/TACON transfer of
           USTRANSCOM air mobility forces to USPACOM in support of emergent theater
           requirements (e.g., sensitive reconnaissance operational, HADR).
           1.2.6.4. Coordinate on air mobility operations in plans, operational orders, and other
           documents as appropriate.
           1.2.6.5. Provide support to the 607 AOC for operations in Korea, and the 611 AOC
           for NORAD and USNORTHCOM operations in Alaska.
           1.2.6.6. Advise PACAF/A3 on the pros/cons (justification) for the OPCON/TACON
           transfer of PACAF-assigned forces from USPACOM to USTRANSCOM in support
           of operations outside the PACOM AOR.
        1.2.7. 7 AF (AFKOR). Conduct similar staff actions (i.e., paragraph 1.2.1 above) to
        support Korean theater operations. Reach back for HQ PACAF support as required.
        1.2.8. PACAF Wing Commanders.
           1.2.8.1. Deployments. Ensure deploying unit personnel understand organization and
           command relationships at their deployed location.
           1.2.8.2. Employment from Home Station. Ensure assigned wing personnel and
           tenant units understand the organization and command relationships they currently
           operate under during steady state, and will operate under during contingency
           operations. Advise NAF and HQ PACAF on the Wing’s plan to integrate attached
           expeditionary forces into the wing structure. HQ PACAF/A1M will publish G-series
           orders establishing new units (e.g., groups, squadrons), as required.          For
           OPLANs/CONPLANs with established TPFDDs, wings will propose subordinate
           wing organizations down to the squadron level in order to allow HQ PACAF/A1M to
           rapidly generate the required G-series orders at execution. Document proposed wing
           contingency organization for OPLANs/CONPLANs in Base Support Plans (BSP) (T-
           2).
2. Standing Command Relationships.
     2.1. COMPACAF Authority.        COMPACAF derives authority through the USAF
     administrative control (ADCON) chain of command and through the USPACOM operational
     chain of command.
        2.1.1. USAF ADCON Authority. COMPACAF is designated Commander, Pacific Air
        Forces (PACAF), a USAF major command, in accordance with AFI 51-604. Per CSAF
        direction (AF Mission Directive 8, 9 April 2012) COMPACAF exercises ADCON of Air
        Force forces assigned/attached to USPACOM. Additionally, CSAF directs COMPACAF
        to establish, sustain, improve, maintain, and operate PACAF bases and facilities
        throughout the USPACOM AOR and Alaska. COMPACAF is COMAFFOR to
        CDRUSPACOM, and as such is the senior Airman in the PACOM AOR. COMPACAF
        will nominate additional COMAFFORs, as required, to subordinate joint forces
        established under the authority of CDRUSPACOM.
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                5


     2.1.2. Operational Command Authority. Per PACOMINST S3020.2L, Command
     Relationships in USPACOM, COMPACAF exercises OPCON of all non-SOF Air Force
     forces assigned or attached to CDRUSPACOM.               PACOM standing command
     relationships are depicted in Attachment 2, Figure A2.1.
         2.1.2.1. Theater JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA designation.             Per PACOMINST
         S3020.2L, COMPACAF is designated the Theater Joint Force Air Component
         Commander (JFACC), Theater Area Air Defense Commander (AADC), Theater
         Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and Theater Space Coordinating Authority (SCA)
         for the PACOM Area of Operations, except for those areas within the Korean
         Theater. Note: Korean Theater Definition. The area bounded by the Korean Air
         Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), any operations taking place in the vicinity of
         and involving North Korea, or area defined by OPLAN as Korean Theater of
         Operations (KTO), once declared.
  2.2. Deputy Designations.
     2.2.1. PACAF/CV is the Deputy Theater COMAFFOR/JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA.
     Additional Deputy Theater AADC designations are as follows:
         2.2.1.1. 94th AAMDC/CC is designated Deputy Theater AADC as the senior Army
         air defender and senior commander of PACOM's only permanently-placed theater
         ballistic missile defense (BMD) assets. 94th AAMDC/CC is responsible for advising
         the AADC on the best distribution of BMD capabilities amongst competing theater
         requirements.
         2.2.1.2. COMPACFLT may be requested to provide a senior officer to function as an
         additional Deputy Theater AADC, to provide expertise and oversight of maritime
         counter air and BMD weapon systems. This construct can enhance liaison with the
         Maritime Component in determining best use of maritime Air and Missile Defense
         assets amongst competing requirements.
  2.3. PACAF OPCON and ADCON command lines. COMPACAF exercises day-to-day
  steady state command of PACAF forces as depicted in Attachment 3, Figure A3.1, and as
  follows:
     2.3.1. Korea. “7 AF (AFKOR)” is the formal unit designation of the PACAF
     subordinate NAF which is also the USFK Air Force component, however, for brevity the
     term “7 AF” is generally used in this document and elsewhere. For PACAF forces
     stationed in Korea, COMPACAF delegates OPCON and ADCON to 7 AF/CC.
     Additionally, during armistice, any other PACAF assigned or attached forces operating
     inside the Korean theater will be under the TACON of 7 AF/CC, unless directed
     otherwise by COMPACAF. Note: CDRUSPACOM has delegated TACON for force
     protection with the Korean Theater to COMUSKOREA.                  Additionally, per
     CDRUSPACOM direction, 7AF/CC is designated the Joint Force Air Component
     Commander (JFACC), Area Air Defense Commander (AADC), Airspace Control
     Authority (ACA) and Space Coordinating Authority (SCA) in direct support to
     COMUSKOREA during Armistice and is designated Commander, Air Component
     Command (CACC) when Combined Forces Command (CFC) stands up. Functional
6                                                             PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


       component command relationships within CFC will be established by Commander,
       Combined Forces Command.
       2.3.2. Outside Korea. For 11 AF and 5 AF forces, COMPACAF delegates ADCON to
       respective Numbered Air Force (NAF) Commanders. However, COMPACAF exercises
       OPCON directly over the wings.
       2.3.3. Clarification of ADCON. ADCON is a Service authority and responsibility to
       support and administer Service forces. COMPACAF exercises ADCON through
       subordinate PACAF commanders. NAF commanders exercise ADCON commensurate
       with their geopolitical situation, subordinate personnel and their administrative
       requirements, and when the NAF is staffed to add value to the PACAF process. In all
       other cases, a “skip echelon” situation exists in which HQ PACAF staff functionals work
       directly with PACAF Wings to ensure an adequate level of ADCON is exercised. In the
       end, commanders at all levels must ensure PACAF forces are sufficiently supported and
       administered, or else identify shortfalls to higher headquarters for resolution.
    2.4. Additional COMPACAF Direction.
       2.4.1. 613 AOC will provide command and control of all PACAF assigned or attached
       forces participating in ongoing operations in the PACOM AOR, but outside the Korean
       Theater. Day-to-day ongoing operations include air mobility, ISR, integrated air and
       missile defense (IAMD), and personnel recovery operations. 611 AOC will provide
       command and control of air sovereignty missions in the Alaska NORAD Region (ANR)
       in support of the ANR Commander. 607 AOC will provide command and control of
       PACAF forces operating in the Korean Theater of Operations (KTO).
          2.4.1.1. Air Tasking Order (ATO). To facilitate the C2 of PACAF forces within the
          PACOM AOR the 613 AOC and 607 AOC will each produce an ATO which includes
          select missions within the PACOM AOR. The 613 AOC ATO includes air missions
          under OPCON of COMPACAF, and the 607 AOC ATO includes air missions under
          OPCON or TACON of                   7 AF/CC. For missions requiring flight into the
          Korean Theater that are not under control of         7 AF/CC, the 607 AOC will
          coordinate with the 613 AOC for scheduling and deconfliction purposes. The
          following general guidelines apply:
              2.4.1.1.1. “Hybrid” Missions. Missions that are tasked for operations both within
              and outside the Korean Theater will be included on both the 613 AOC and 607
              AOC ATO for tracking and deconfliction purposes. To ensure tactical mission
              data published in both ATOs is consistent, the 613 AOC will have the “lead” for
              hybrid missions, and the 607 AOC will replicate the mission details on their ATO,
              with note in the mission amplification section stating “SOURCE ATO IS 613
              AOC.”
              2.4.1.1.2. Korean Theater Missions. Missions which are tasked only within the
              Korean Theater will be on the 607 AOC ATO. If these missions originate outside
              of the KTO, the 607 AOC will coordinate with the 613 AOC for scheduling and
              deconfliction prior to ATO production and dissemination.
              2.4.1.1.3. Tanker and Airlift Missions. Due to the many scenarios involving
              intratheater and intertheater tanker and airlift missions, these sorties may be
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                     7


            included on the 607 AOC and 613 AOC ATOs at the discretion of the respective
            AOC commanders. At a minimum, tanker missions will be included on the same
            ATO as the missions they are supporting.
     2.4.2. PACAF Orders. COMPACAF authorizes PACAF/CS and A3 to approve and
     release exercise and operational orders, to include transferring PACAF assigned or
     attached forces to appropriate commanders. All such orders will clearly indicate the new
     organization and command relationships (both OPCON/TACON and ADCON) of the
     affected forces.
     2.4.3. Global Force Management (GFM) Allocation Taskings. The GFM allocation
     process consists of two specific supporting processes--rotational force allocation in
     support of combatant commander (CCDR) annual force needs, and emergent force
     allocation in support of CCDR emerging or crisis-based requests for capabilities and
     forces. ACC/A3O works with HAF and MAJCOMs to develop and provide the AF
     positions concerning Joint Staff force requests to ACC. ACC is designated as AF lead to
     the Global Force Management Board to represent AF sourcing solutions. PACAF/A3
     coordinates on all GFM taskings affecting PACAF forces. Once approved by SecDef,
     ACC/A3O will publish the AF PLANORD/EXORD/DEPORDs and distribute directly to
     affected MAJCOMs and NAFs. ACC will also input the GFM taskings into the AF
     Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS). PACAF wings are authorized to execute based
     on the ACC EXORD/DEPORD/PLANORD. If additional EXORD/DEPORD
     clarification is needed, PACAF/A3 is designated as the PACAF issuing authority for
     supplemental PACAF orders. Further explanation of the Joint and Air Force tasking
     process can be found in appropriate Global Force Management Implementation
     Guidance (GFMIG) documents.
     2.4.4. Wing Commander Authority. Wing commanders exercise ADCON authority over
     subordinate forces, but generally not OPCON or TACON, which reside at the air
     component level (e.g., PACAF or a component NAF), unless specifically delegated lower
     for an operational mission or exercise.
     2.4.5. Active, Reserve and Guard Associate Units. Both classic and active associate
     constructs exist between PACAF and air reserve component (ARC) units. They will
     follow the organizational and operational framework outlined in total force integration
     (TFI) doctrine and policy (e.g., AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force
     Integration; and AFPD 90-10, Total Force Integration Policy). All associate unit
     organizations require a total force association plan (A-Plan) signed by both the respective
     MAJCOM commanders (NGB, in the case of ANG). Additional detailed command
     relationships, such as ADCON, are resident in MAJCOM, NAF, and wing-level addenda
     and/or support agreements. The concept of operational direction (OPDIR) is explained
     in AFI 90-1001. OPDIR is not a joint recognized command authority and is strictly for
     use between Air Force TFI associate units.
  2.5. PACOM Subunified Commanders.         During normal day-to-day operations,
  COMPACAF, not subunified commanders, exercises OPCON over PACAF forces.
  Exception: CDRUSPACOM has delegated TACON for force protection within the Korean
  Theater and the Japan area to COMUSFK and COMUSFJ, respectively. CDRUSPACOM
  may attach forces (with OPCON) to subunified commanders as required to execute
8                                                            PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


    contingency operations. The following paragraphs discuss PACAF standing relationships
    with respect to other joint commands.
       2.5.1. 7AF (AFKOR). 7 AF (AFKOR) is a subordinate PACAF NAF and also the Air
       Force component of USKOREA, a PACOM subunified command. As the service
       component commander to a subunified commander,7 AF/CC is the COMAFFOR to
       COMUSKOREA.
       2.5.2. COMUSJAPAN.           5 AF/CC is also the Commander, US Forces Japan
       (COMUSJAPAN). 5 AF provides support to COMUSJAPAN for USFJ tasks related to
       pol-mil engagement with Japan and the maintenance of US Forces in Japan (e.g., SOFA,
       AT/FP, access, facilities and infrastructure, HNS, etc.). COMPACAF operates in support
       of     USFJ      (or      JFC-J       if    established)    to  provide    operational
       COMAFFOR/JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA support.                     5 AF/CV leads the joint air
       component coordination element (JACCE), when activated, for COMPACAF in his
       positions as Theater JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA. Refer to PACOM Instruction S3020.2L,
       Enclosure 7 for more detailed guidance.
       2.5.3. COMALCOM.     11 AF/CC is designated Commander, Alaska Command
       (COMALCOM). 11 AF/CC also serves as the Air Force Service component commander
       in support of ALCOM.
       2.5.4. Additional Alaska Command Relationships. Alaska is geographically in the
       USNORTHCOM AOR while the forces in Alaska are predominantly assigned (i.e., under
       COCOM authority) to CDRUSPACOM. Some strategic defense forces are assigned to
       CDRUSELEMNORAD (see Forces For Unified Commands, Table IV-2, Strategic
       Defensive Forces). Additionally, CDRNORAD is tasked with the air defense mission in
       Alaska. This gives rise to further complexity for 11 AF/CC and staff.
          2.5.4.1. COMANR. 11 AF/CC is also designated Commander, Alaskan NORAD
          Region (COMANR).         COMANR exercises OPCON of forces assigned to
          CDRUSELEMNORAD on a day-to-day basis for the air warning mission. In
          addition, COMANR exercises OPCON of specified air defense forces based on a
          standing JCS EXORD establishing multiple levels of air defense readiness and
          procedures for moving from one level of readiness to another. COMANR exercises
          command and control of air sovereignty missions in the ANR via the 611 AOC.
          2.5.4.2. JTF-AK. 11AF/CC (as COMALCOM) is also designated Commander JTF-
          AK, the USNORTHCOM JTF commander charged with homeland defense and civil
          support missions in Alaska. 11 AF/CC is additionally designated the Air Force
          Service component commander and JFACC for JTF-AK. Day-to-day, no forces are
          assigned or attached to JTF-AK.
       2.5.5. JTF-SFA. By CDRUSPACOM direction, PACAF provides the commander for
       Joint Task Force-Support Forces Antarctica (JTF-SFA), the only Air Force-led standing
       joint task force. It is a collaborative Department of Defense and National Science
       Foundation effort supporting the United States Antarctic Program through Operation
       DEEP FREEZE. See Attachment 7, Figure A7.1 for depiction of JTF-SFA.
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                    9


3. Contingency Command Relationships.
   3.1. PACOM Contingency Organization. PACOM standing organization (see Attachment
   2, Figure A2.1) features CDRUSPACOM and subordinate service and functional
   components, as well as subordinate unified commands. This existing structure conducts
   Phase 0 operations and will likely be relied upon to execute initial operations in any
   contingency.       Initial contingency response may be organized by CDRUSPACOM
   designating an existing service/functional component commander as lead for an entire
   operation, or as lead in a line of effort within a broader operation. CDRUSPACOM may also
   establish a joint task force (JTF) to accomplish a specific mission. In any case, COMPACAF
   organizes and provides the Air Force contribution to the joint force and makes
   recommendations for joint command arrangements. Ultimately, CDRUSPACOM will
   approve the joint organization of forces tasked for a given mission. For specific OPLANs and
   CONPLANs, refer to Annex J of the respective plan for expected command relationships.
   Ultimately, a properly constructed PACOM operational order (DEPORD, EXORD, OPORD)
   defines the operational command relationships for a PACOM contingency, and a subsequent
   PACAF order should further clarify PACAF participation, organization, and command
   relationships.
   3.2. PACAF Force Organization Options. The following three figures depict organizational
   options for PACAF in response to a new PACOM mission.
      3.2.1. Day-to-Day Operations (Figure 1). A contingency operation could be executed
      through the standing organization with COMPACAF as Theater COMAFFOR/JFACC.
 10                                                          PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


Figure 1. Day-to-Day Operations




      3.2.2. Theater JFACC in support of a new joint task force JTF (Figure 2). If
      CDRUSPACOM establishes a JTF to plan and execute a mission, COMPACAF may
      advocate for the Theater JFACC to operate in direct support of the newly activated JTF,
      as opposed to providing the JTF a discrete Air Force component to include dedicated
      (i.e., CHOP’d) forces. In many cases the Theater JFACC solution allows for the most
      efficient use of limited theater resources, allows the needs of multiple JTFs (and
      Subunified commands) to be dynamically prioritized and serviced, and leaves forces best
      postured to handle the next arising crisis.
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                 11


Figure 2. Theater JFACC Supporting JTF




      3.2.3. CHOP Discrete Air Force component to JTF (Figure 3). In some circumstances,
      a joint force may require exclusively dedicated forces. In such a case, PACAF should
      advocate the CHOP (i.e., transfer of forces with specification of OPCON) of a dedicated
      Air Force component to the JTF, to include a COMAFFOR and specified forces. In such
      cases, the concept of command and control (C2), and forces/staff provided for C2, must
      be specifically identified.
 12                                                            PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


Figure 3. JTF With AF Component




   3.3. Small Team Participation. In some instances, select PACAF individuals or small teams
   could augment another component (e.g. JSOAC, or NAVFOR), rather than establishing a
   discrete AFFOR component. However, the Air Force contingent should still be organized as
   a single entity (perhaps named simply as “Air Force element”) and led by the senior Airman
   in the contingent. Furthermore, for such deployments, the senior Airman should be clearly
   and formally identified. Because designation as a COMAFFOR is not be appropriate, the
   senior Airman could instead be designated as, for example; commander, Air Force element;
   team chief; or officer/noncommissioned officer in charge. This formally identifies the senior
   Air Force member as leader of the deployed element. Additionally, the ADCON chain of
   command from the team to a PACAF organization will be clearly established to enable
   Service support and reporting.
   3.4. OPLAN/CONPLAN command relationships.          In all     cases, relevant
   OPLANs/CONPLANs must be referenced and will serve as the basis for establishing
   appropriate command relationships.
   3.5. Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON is the Service authority allowing the Air
   Force to present a cohesive force to a joint commander. Parent MAJCOMs (i.e., MAJCOMs
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                    13


  to which forces are permanently assigned) always retain some elements of ADCON when
  they deploy forces forward; conversely, theater COMAFFORs gain Service authority through
  some transfer of specified ADCON. Specified ADCON is normally transferred by mutual
  agreement of deploying and receiving MAJCOM commanders. PACAF must engage with
  deploying MAJCOMs early in the planning stage to ensure agreement in the specified
  ADCON to be transferred. This agreement should be published in both PACAF orders and
  supporting MAJCOM deployment orders.
     3.5.1. For any Air Force forces deployed for operations in the PACOM AOR, the
     following specified ADCON authorities should transfer to COMPACAF from the owning
     MAJCOM commander: UCMJ authority, protection of assigned forces and assets,
     billeting, dining, force reporting, morale, welfare and safety.
     3.5.2. For transient Air Force forces (e.g., intertheater air mobility), COMPACAF
     exercises, as a minimum, authorities for force protection and force reporting that accrue
     from CDRUSPACOM as geographic combatant commander (GCC). Exception:
     CDRUSPACOM has delegated TACON for force protection within the Korean Theater
     and Japan area to COMUSFK and COMUSFJ, respectively.
     3.5.3. Air National Guard. For members in the Air National Guard, prior coordination
     with parent organizations commanders are required. ANG forces in Federal service
     attached to PACAF for OPCON are assigned to the ANGRC/201 MSS for ADCON.
     Transfer of specified ADCON necessary for a COMAFFOR to carry out assigned
     missions should be coordinated with the 201 MSS/CC and/or ANGRC/CC and published
     in appropriate orders.
     3.5.4. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). For members of the Air Force Reserve,
     prior coordination with parent organizations’ commanders is required. AFRC/CC will
     retain ADCON at all times over AFRC Forces. Specified ADCON necessary for a
     COMAFFOR to carry out assigned missions will be transferred by mutual agreements
     and published in both PACAF orders and supporting MAJCOM deployment orders.
  3.6. Force Organization Considerations. In order to properly identify/characterize PACAF
  participation in a new joint force, PACAF must stay engaged with PACOM staff on several
  fronts, to include daily joint operations, deliberate planning and crisis action planning. For
  any new joint force, there are some common considerations for how PACAF should organize
  forces for presentation. The following information should be gathered and analyzed:
     3.6.1. Command relationship guidance from relevant OPLAN/CONPLAN.
     3.6.2. The Joint mission, to include anticipated duration.
     3.6.3. The Joint force structure, to include other known Service and functional
     components, and the ranks of the commanders, if known.
     3.6.4. Expected PACAF and Air Force mission, to include frequency and types of sorties
     and/or other employment activity.
     3.6.5. Bed-down locations and other operating locations (i.e., transient or divert
     locations).
     3.6.6. Required Air Force forces in as much detail as possible, to include number and
     types of combat and support forces, by unit type code (UTC) whenever possible.
 14                                                           PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


       3.6.7. Available PACAF forces suitable to task.
       3.6.8. Expected (non-PACOM) Air Force components/MAJCOMs providing
       augmentation forces. Determine whether these forces will be attached (with OPCON) to
       CDRUSPACOM, who in turn delegates to COMPACAF.
       3.6.9. See additional information in Air Force doctrine, Volume 1 (Basic Doctrine),
       Chapter Six, section “Air Force Component Presentation Considerations.”
   3.7. Required decisions. For any new joint operation, based on analysis of above
   information paragraph 3.6, PACAF leadership should decide, or propose to CDRUSPACOM,
   the following:
       3.7.1. Should a discrete Air Force component be CHOP’d to a newly activated JTF, or
       should COMPACAF retain OPCON of participating PACAF forces and operate in direct
       support of the new JTF?
       3.7.2. Identify relevant COMAFFOR/JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA.
       3.7.3. Identify DIRMOBFOR, if required.
       3.7.4. Identify force composition to include parent wings and squadrons of participating
       forces, proposed beddown locations, and proposed lead wing for each beddown location.
       3.7.5. Identify organizational structure in as much detail as practical, to include AETF
       name and all expeditionary units to be established by G-series orders. See Air Force
       Doctrine, Volume 1, Basic Doctrine, for additional information on forming Air Force
       expeditionary organizations.
          3.7.5.1. Attached expeditionary forces deploying to an existing PACAF base will
          normally be organized within the existing wing structure.
          3.7.5.2. The 13 EAF is a standing organization attached to HQ PACAF and is
          normally commanded by the PACAF/CS or A3. A new expeditionary force could be
          attached directly to the 13 EAF if desirable.
       3.7.6. Propose appropriate command relationships based on higher headquarters
       direction combined with COMPACAF prerogative. Include both operational control
       (OPCON) and administrative control (ADCON).
       3.7.7. Identify COMAFFOR/JFACC tasking mechanism above the wing level (e.g.,
       JFACC through ATO).
4. Exercises.
   4.1. Command relationships objective. The objective of exercises is to provide realistic
   training, but in terms of command relationships, there are some distinct challenges. During
   contingencies, SecDef signs orders transferring CONUS combat forces with OPCON to
   CDRUSPACOM, who in turn, will normally transfer forces with specification of OPCON
   (also known as “CHOP”) to a subordinate commander. For peacetime exercises, though,
   SecDef will not issue orders affecting the transfer (with OPCON) of forces. However, the
   SecDef -approved Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) (reference
   a) states “unless otherwise specified by the SecDef, and with the exception of the
   USNORTHCOM AOR, a CCDR has TACON for exercise purposes whenever forces not
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                   15


  assigned to that CCDR undertake exercises in that CCDR’s AOR…. this provision for
  TACON normally does not apply to USTRANSCOM or USSTRATCOM assets.” Because
  of this GFMIG direction, Alaska-based exercises are problematic in that while
  CDRUSPACOM is assigned most of the forces in Alaska, Alaska is geographically part of
  the NORTHCOM AOR. Given the above challenges, the C2 construct for training will not
  precisely mirror contingency operations. Nonetheless, the goal is to create organizational
  and command structures corresponding as closely as possible to real world contingency
  operations. To that end, the following principles apply for crafting command relationships
  for exercises:
  4.2. Organizing exercise command relationships. As much as possible, design exercise
  organizations and appoint commanders to allow command relationships similar to a real
  world contingency; toward this end and where practical, organize AF forces participating in
  an exercise as a discrete AETF. TACON (as a minimum) of forces should be transferred to
  the COMAFFOR whenever possible. Also administrative control (ADCON) should be
  similar to real world contingency operations.
     4.2.1. Outside of Alaska. Per Forces for Unified Commands memorandum direction (see
     paragraph 4.1, above), TACON of non-PACOM exercise forces (less TRANSCOM)
     transfers to CDRUSPACOM. CDRUSPACOM, in turn, should transfer TACON to the
     exercise CJTF or Subunified commander, as appropriate. The CJTF or Subunified
     commander, in turn, should delegate TACON to the corresponding Service component
     commanders. This issue should be emphasized at the planning conference of all
     exercises, and TACON should be addressed/delegated in formal orders. Functional
     component commanders (e.g., JFACC) should be given TACON of capabilities/aircraft
     on an "as required/by sortie" basis, as opposed to long-term TACON of units.
     COMPACAF (and commanders as delegated) will have specified ADCON of all
     participating USAF forces for "exercise execution, UCMJ, protection of assigned forces
     and assets, billeting, dining, force reporting, morale, welfare and safety." This requires
     the consent of other MAJCOM commanders, so should be addressed early in the planning
     process. Non-US forces remain under the OPCON of their respective nation, but
     whenever possible TACON of exercise aircraft/sorties should be transferred to the
     appropriate COMAFFOR/JFACC. If this cannot be achieved, then as a minimum,
     exercise planners will ensure coordinated procedures are in place to allow for safe
     operations with foreign participants (e.g., the US-Japan bilateral construct).
     4.2.2. Red Flag Alaska. COMPACAF requests TACON of all participating US forces
     and then delegates TACON of PACAF-assigned and the other participating US forces to
     11 AF/CC. 11 AF/CC normally delegates TACON to 354 FW/CC who exercises control
     of flight operations through the 353 CTS. A deployed forces commander (DFC) is
     appointed and responsible to the 354 FW for the overall execution and employment of
     Blue Forces and ensures that operational training is IAW exercise mission essential task
     lists (METLs) developed during the planning conference. In addition to operations, the
     DFC will have oversight of maintenance, logistics, and support functions. Specified
     ADCON of participating forces will not be transferred from home units. Pursuant to AFI
     guidance, members are subject to direction of host installation commanders. See
     Attachment 6, Figure A6.1 for sample diagram depicting Red Flag Alaska command
     relationships.
 16                                                            PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014


      4.2.3. Other Nations in Red Flag Alaska. Non-US forces remain under the OPCON of
      their respective nation, but whenever possible TACON of exercise forces should be
      transferred to 11 AF/CC. If this cannot be achieved, then as a minimum, exercise
      planners will ensure coordinated procedures are in place to allow for safe operations with
      foreign participants.
5. Documenting Command Relationships.
   5.1. Contingency planning. Consistent with CJCSM 3122.03C, The Joint Operational
   Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Vol. II, Planning Formats and Guidance, planners
   will document command relations for contingency plans in Annex J to the basic plan. This
   annex will include designation of supported and supporting commanders, coordination
   instructions, and listing of the command relationships (COCOM, OPCON, TACON) being
   proposed for President/SecDef approval that the gaining commander may exercise over
   transferred forces and the locations where the transfer will be effective (normally the AOR
   boundary). COMPACAF contingency plans will include an additional section entitled,
   PACAF Presentation of Forces, which will clearly identify the Air Force forces and their
   command relationships at an operational level, to include OPCON and ADCON down to the
   wing level. PACAF wing commanders are responsible for identifying a suitable wing
   structure (i.e., a combination of existing and expeditionary groups/squadrons) for OPLAN
   and CONPLAN taskings and include these OPLAN/CONPLAN wing organizations in wing
   Base Support Plans (BSP) and Expeditionary Site Plans (ESP). During execution, Annex J
   and BSP/ESP should serve as the starting points for command relationships, and be modified
   (through appropriate order) as necessary to reflect the actual force structure employed at
   execution.
   5.2. Crisis Action Planning. During crisis action planning, command relationships are
   documented in a number of places throughout the crisis action planning process. Force
   structure and mission are key determinants of the command relationships; it is critical
   operational planners determine mission and proposed force structure as early as possible in
   the planning process. Command relationships will be promulgated in official orders to
   affected commands and commanders to ensure proper C2 of forces. Appendix 3 shows the
   PACAF staff process for establishing organization and command relationships for
   contingency operations.
   5.3. Organization and Command Relationships Diagrams.              An appropriate PACAF
   operational order (e.g., OPORD, EXORD, DEPORD) will identify force organization and
   command relationships. Based on this PACAF order, HQ PACAF/A1M publishes diagrams
   graphically depicting Air Force organization (Attachment 4, Figure A4.1). Appropriate
   level (PACAF or NAF) A5 will publish command relationships diagrams (Attachment 5,
   Figure A5.1) for forces being presented by PACAF to a JFC. In some cases the two
   diagrams may be combined to reflect both organization and command relationships on one
   slide. It must be remembered that the organization slide's principal purpose is to graphically
   depict PACAF G-series orders establishing Air Force expeditionary units, down to the group
   and squadron level. The command relationships chart, in contrast, is designed to provide a
   more macro view of command relationships, from PACOM and PACAF down to the wing
   level.
PACAFI13-101 18 JULY 2014                                                                17


  5.4. G-Series Orders Establishing Units. HQ PACAF/A1M publishes G-Series orders IAW
  AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, establishing all PACAF expeditionary units. Orders
  state the ADCON hierarchal chain of command and the extent of ADCON authorities. A1M
  will coordinate expeditionary G-series orders with the appropriate component NAF A3/A5
  and HQ PACAF/JAO prior to publication and with A1 as required (usually for permanent
  organizational changes).
  5.5. Appointment to or Assumption of Command Orders. Based on the G-Series orders
  published by HQ PACAF/A1M, HQ PACAF/JA will, in consultation with HQ PACAF/A1,
  determine whether command should be established by appointment or assumption of
  command orders. The appropriate unit(s), as determined by the affected JA staff(s), will
  prepare, draft, publish, and distribute assumption/appointment of command orders using AF
  Form 35s, Request and Authorization for Assumption of/Appointment to Command, for all
  affected units, in accordance with AFI 51-604.
  5.6. Publishing Orders for Contingencies and Exercises. PACAF/CS or A3 approves and
  releases exercise and operational orders for COMPACAF, transferring PACAF assigned and
  attached forces to appropriate commanders. All such orders will clearly indicate the new
  organization and command relationships (both OPCON and ADCON) of the affected forces.
     5.6.1. Guidance for Orders. Similar to format in JOPES Vol I, Appendix A to Enclosure
     N, the final section for all PACAF EXORDs/DEPORDs will be entitled “Command
     Relationships,” and will state the command relationships for all forces being employed
     by the order, to include both OPCON and ADCON. "Tasks" paragraph will direct
     appropriate subordinate commanders to transfer or accept forces, as appropriate, to
     include a statement of where/when the transfer takes place.
  5.7. Exercises. Command relationships of exercise forces should closely mirror those
  expected during real world execution. Command relationships of both U.S. and coalition
  forces should be considered throughout the exercise planning process, and documented in
  exercise plans and orders. PACOM issues planning directives to provide guidance for
  planning, conducting and evaluating PACOM exercises. Directives should include a
  paragraph stating the command relationships for all forces being employed in the exercise.
  This guidance should be considered during all planning conferences. Questions or issues
  with command relationships must be addressed as early as possible in the exercise planning
  process.

Notes:
1. Use of term “7AF.” Formal unit designation is “7 AF (AFKOR),” per PACAF Special Order
GS-08-012; however, for brevity and consistency with other NAFs, the term “ 7 AF” is normally
used.
2. PACAF forces stationed outside Korea: COMPACAF exercises ADCON of PACAF wings
through NAFs. COMPACAF exercises OPCON directly over wings.
3. PACAF forces stationed in Korea: COMPACAF delegates ADCON and OPCON to
7AF/CC. Additionally, during armistice, any PACAF assigned or attached forces operating
inside the Korean theater are under the TACON of 7 AF/CC.
4. USFJ component/Service Support: 5 AF provides support to COMUSJAPAN for USFJ
tasks related to pol-mil engagement with Japan and the maintenance of US Forces in Japan (e.g.,
SOFA, AT/FP, access, facilities and infrastructure, HNS, etc.). COMPACAF operates in support

of USFJ (or JFC-J if established) to provide operational
COMAFFOR/JFACC/AADC/ACA/SCA support.
5. Force protection. CDRUSPACOM has delegated TACON for force protection within the
Korean Theater and the Japan area to COMUSFK and COMUSFJ, respectively.
