    empty all pockets and remove the AF Form, 1199CD Controlled Form, Air Force Entry
    Control Card, USAF Restricted Area Line Badge or locally issued badges. Check the
    bottom of footwear and put on coveralls without pockets, zippers or buttons (bunny
    suits). Personnel entering F-16 intakes will remove shoes or put on shoe coverings.
    Bunny suits are not required for A-10 inlet inspection provided restricted area badge is
    removed, all pockets are emptied, footwear is free of debris, and all uniform buttons,
    snaps, zipper pulls, etc., are accounted for before and after inspection. During combat
    exercises, procedures for intake inspections will be identified in approved simulations
    and deviations in accordance with AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
    4.2.13. Bunny suits used for intake or inlet inspection/maintenance or A-10 white area
    inspection/maintenance will be modified in the following manner: (Exception: The 726

SPANGDAHLEMABI21-107 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              7


          4.2.17.2. Prior to starting engines, inspect inlet/intake for ice or moisture. If present,
          remove all ice and moisture from intake prior to starting engine.
          4.2.17.3. Squeegees must be made available for use in F-16 shelters to remove
          standing water 5 feet behind and 25 feet forward and to the sides of the intake lip
          prior to engine start.
          4.2.17.4. After engine start, ensure that engine anti-ice procedures are followed per
          the applicable technical data.
       4.2.18. To accomplish inlet observation, a ground observer will be stationed outside the
       danger zone and if needed will use a flashlight to observe the intake/inlet of the aircraft as
       the engine(s) is/are being operated. On A-10 aircraft one observer may monitor both
       engines. The ground observer will be responsible for the safety of personnel in the
       immediate aircraft area. Do not enter the aircraft danger areas for any reason.
       4.2.19. Continually observe air inlet leading edge for ice formation. If ice is observed
       engine will be shut down IAW applicable technical data. Anytime an engine is shut
       down due to ice formation, the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will be notified
       and inlet/intake inspection will be performed. 726 AMS maintainers will notify the 726
       AMS MOC and an inlet icing inspection will be performed.
       4.2.20. Maintenance personnel performing end of runway inspection in presence of
       standing water, snow, or ice will use extra caution and have one person monitor the
       intake/inlet lip(s) at all times for ice buildup. End of Runway personnel will have brooms
       and squeegees available to ensure the engine run area is clear at all times. MOC will be
       notified if any ice buildup is noted.
       4.2.21. Engine Blade Blending Procedures F-16 & A-10 Aircraft only.
          4.2.21.1. All F110-GE-129 engine first stage fan blade anomalies will be entered on
          Spangdahlem Form 3. All TF34-GE-100A engine first stage fan blade anomalies will
          be entered on Spangdahlem Form 4.
          4.2.21.2. Transient aircraft blade blending will be performed and documented
          IAW T. O. procedures for the aircraft type.
          4.2.21.3. Only certified personnel identified on the special cert roster (SCR) will
          accomplish blade blending. Support sections will maintain a list of personnel from
          the SCR authorized to sign out blade blending kits. The 726 AMS Support Section
          will use the TAS to meet this requirement.
5. Flight-line Vehicle Operation:
   5.1. Vehicles will have a properly secured self-closing lid type container in the bed of the
   vehicle. Vehicles which do not have the necessary space to store a container in the bed will
   have, at a minimum, a foreign object (FO) pouch secured in the driver’s area. Containers
   will be secured preferably in a manner to prevent them from tipping over while the vehicle is
   in motion.
   5.2. Vehicle operators who drive on the flight line will inspect their vehicles for cleanliness
   prior to and after each use and ensure vehicle is free of debris at all times; trash and FOD

     containers will be emptied daily. During winter months FOD checks will include the
     removal of snow and ice from all vehicle surfaces.
     5.3. Do not drive or park on unpaved surfaces, except in emergencies.
     5.4. When reentering a hardened surface, the vehicle operator will collect all debris brought
     onto the surface by the vehicle and ensure tires and undercarriages of vehicle are free of
     rocks and debris. If the quantity of debris is too large, Airfield Management or MOC will be
     notified to coordinate with 52 CES to have a sweeper clean the area.
     5.5. Any holes found in the floorboard or bed of a vehicle must be immediately/permanently
     repaired to prevent items from falling through onto aircraft movement areas.
     5.6. All vehicles will have rubber boots installed around the gearshift and hand brake
     controls.
     5.7. If equipped, magnetic bars will be cleaned at shift change, prior to entering the flight-
     line area (if the vehicle has been out of the area), or when accumulation dictates.
     5.8. Roll Over type FOD inspections will be accomplished on all tires prior to entering the
     flightline. Vehicle operators will stop, check their vehicle and tires for foreign objects at all
     FOD checkpoints (lines and signs) on the airfield. Prior to exiting the vehicle, operator will
     set parking brake. Vehicles ignitions do not have to be turned off when performing a FOD
     check. No FOD check is required when crossing Alpha Taxiway by building 220 (FCP 6)
     and the Air Traffic Control Tower building 77 (FCP 7) or Fire Department building 47 (FCP

                                         COCKPIT FOD

Table A2.1. Cockpit FOD Responsibilities and Reporting Procedures 52FW Only.
Item 1   Notify Maintenance Supervision, MOC, and QA upon discovery of the loss of a tool or
         item. QA will begin the impoundment paperwork. Enter a “RED X” in the AFTO Form
         781A stating “Possible FO in cockpit (and a short description of the FO)”. A thorough
         search will be conducted after completion of each step.
Item 2   If equipped, search other cockpit as necessary to ensure that the item did not migrate
         during flight or maintenance. Additionally, search cabin pressure regulators.
Item 3   Electrically raise the seat as necessary to conduct a more thorough search of the cockpit.

Item 4   Remove components in the immediate area of the loss and as necessary to facilitate
         Search (i.e. map cases, instruments, FOD curtain, kick panels, etc).
Item 5   Egress will (A-10) raise; (F-16) raise and tilt seat(s) as necessary to aid in search. If the
         item is not found following a minimum 2-hour search, to include the use of a boroscope,
         the seat will be removed as required (A-10), the seat and canopy will be removed as
         required (F-16). Egress will then search the seat itself, its surrounding structure, seat
         components and survival kit area. Egress components removed to assist in FO searches
         will not be re-installed until the FOD Red X has been signed off (cleared) in the aircraft
         781A forms or as directed by the 52 MXG/CC. The impoundment write-up does not
         require clearing, prior to this procedure.
Item 6   Additional components will be removed and additional steps followed as directed by the
         impoundment official.
Item 7   If the object is still not found, inform the impoundment official. The impoundment
         official will coordinate with QA and MXG/CC to determine whether to continue the
         search or terminate the impoundment.
