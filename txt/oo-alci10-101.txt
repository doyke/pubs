The primary purpose of this instruction is to provide the Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-
ALC) employees with orderly procedures for the protection of personnel and equipment during
emergency/disaster situations. This document details guidance and responsibilities for the OO-
ALC and 309th maintenance group organizations, to provide effective and timely response to
minimize loss of personnel and material resources in the event of any major accidents, natural
disasters (tornadoes, forest fires, flooding, high winds, etc.), conventional attacks and terrorist
use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosive (CBRNE) attack. This
instruction applies to all OO-ALC and 309th maintenance group employees, military and
civilian, as well as contractors. Personnel assigned to the 309th Aircraft Maintenance and
Regeneration Group and other operating locations are exempt from this instruction, and will
comply with emergency management (EM) operations directed by their host base. It implements
tasks required by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
Program Planning and Operations, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) Installation Emergency
Management Plan 10-2 (IEMP 10-2), and Hill AFB Emergency Management Shelter-In-Place
Guide. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force (AF) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
