                       RESPONSIBILITIES AND SCHEDULING

1.1. General Description. This supplement provides information and procedures for all units
operating in the USAF managed portion of the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR). This area
is referred to as BMGR East, which is comprised of the eastern segment of the BMGR, SELLS
Military Operations Area (MOA)/Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Restricted
Areas 2301E, 2304 and 2305, and Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Airfield (GBAFAF). (Figure
1.1)

Figure 1.1. Barry M. Goldwater Range.




1.1.1. BMGR Defined. Congress divided the BMGR into eastern and western segments in 1999
and assigned management authority to the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, respectively
(Public Law 106-65; referred to hereinafter as the MLWA of 1999). The BMGR segments are:
the Gila Bend (BMGR East) segment, which is approximately 1,050,000 acres; and the Yuma
(BMGR West) segment, which is approximately 691,760 acres. The Air Force controls the land
and airspace of the Gila Bend segment (administered through the 56 Fighter Wing Range
Management Office (56 RMO) at Luke Air Force Base AFB), and the Marine Corps controls the
Yuma segment (administered by the Range Management Division, Marine Corps Air Station

(MCAS) Yuma). A five-mile wide air and ground buffer zone along the R2301E and R2301W
boundary separates the two segments.
1.1.1.1. Gila Bend Segment (BMGR East). The eastern portion of the BMGR underlies a
portion of R-2301E, R-2304, and R-2305, on either side of Arizona State Route (SR) 85, as
shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2. BMGR East, BMGR West and Surrounding Areas.




1.1.1.2. Yuma Segment (BMGR West). The western segment of the BMGR (Figure 1.2)
underlies a portion of R-2301W (west of a line from N32-05.500 W113-30.000 to N32-44.250
W113-41.000). Scheduling control of the BMGR West and R-2301W is delegated to Yuma

1.3. User Classification. Priority is given to the flying squadrons deemed ―Regular Users‖ who
claim the BMGR East as their primary training range.
1.3.1. Regular Users. Units of the 56 FW at Luke AFB, 355 FW, 305 RQS (AFRES), and 563
RQG at Davis-Monthan AFB, 162 FW (ANG) at Tucson International Airport to include the
ANG AFRC Test Center and ANG SNOWBIRD operations, Western Army National Guard
Aviation Training Site, Peace Vanguard, 1-285 AHBE (ARNG), at Silverbell Army Heliport
(Marana, AZ), and the 2-185th CSB, at Papago Army Airfield in Phoenix are considered regular
users. All other units are classified as Casual Users or Hosted Units.
1.3.2. Hosted Units. Units invited to deploy to one of our Regular Users base of operations to
support their mission is considered a Hosted Unit. A common example of a Hosted Unit is a one
performing DACT support. Hosted units typically fly MARSA with their Host and therefore are
not allocated ranges and airspace in the Regular User process. If a Hosted Unit requests airspace
or ranges above and beyond their Host‘s requirements, they are fit into the schedule after the
Regular Users process is done but before the Casual Users are added in.
1.3.3. Casual Users. Units that do not fall under the above definitions of Regular User and
Hosted Unit above. Casual users are scheduled based upon availability of range time after the
regular users have finalized their requirements.
1.3.4. Unscheduled Users ("bootlegging"). Unscheduled users request entry onto a cold range by
contacting Snakeye prior to takeoff, or Snakeye once airborne (see Appendix 6 for radio
frequency information). Snakeye will coordinate with the appropriate RCO if an unscheduled
manned range is requested. The RCO will notify base operations.
1.4. Range Availability. From 1 October through 31 March, BMGR East normal operating
hours are (except Federal Holidays) from 0730-2330L Mountain Standard Time (MST), Monday
through Friday, and 0800-1700L MST on two ANG/AFRES flying weekend days per month.
From 01 April through 30 September, BMGR East normal operating hours are (except Federal
Holidays) from 0700-2300L MST, Monday through Friday, and 0800-1700L MST on two
ANG/AFRES flying weekend days per month. Arizona maintains MST all year round (no

Daylight Savings Time [DST]), therefore, local time for the BMGR is always ZULU minus 7
hours. The weekend fly dates are published on the range calendar at the Range Scheduling
website.
1.4.1. Obtaining Range Time Outside of Normal Hours. BMGR East time may be requested
outside of the normal operating hours by coordinating with Range Scheduling. See Casual User
Range Request folder at our website for the request format. Requests must be received at least 30
days in advance to coordinate contractor support. Units will be charged for support (referred to
as contract ―call-outs) outside normal operating hours. Funds must be transferred before
confirming range times the day prior.
1.5. Manned Range Restrictions and Constraints.
1.5.1. 01 April through 30 September. Four manned ranges are available from sunrise plus 30
minutes, but no earlier than 0700 until sunset/1800, whichever occurs first, Monday through
Friday. Night manned ranges are available from sunset/1800 (whichever occurs first) until 2230.
1.5.2. 01 October through 31 March. Four manned ranges are available from sunrise plus 30
minutes, but no earlier than 0730 until sunset/1830, whichever occurs first, Monday through
Friday. Night manned ranges are available from sunset/1830 (whichever occurs first) until 2300.
1.5.3. Add-ons. Add-ons are defined as requests made after 1600 of the workday prior. Short-
notice requests to add-on range times outside or beyond pre-scheduled range hours can be denied
due to minimum notification time requirements to alert support crews.
1.5.4. Night Operations. All ranges are night capable. Ranges 1, 2 and 4 are the preferred night
ranges. Range 3 is not normally used for night missions since the East Tactical range must also
be scheduled to accommodate F-16 users and conflicts with the night Visual Flight Rules
(VFR)/Night Vision Goggle (NVG) pattern at GBAFAF.
1.6. Scheduling guidelines. BMGR East use (air and ground) must be coordinated with 56
RMO/ASMS. Any operation involving GBAFAF in conjunction with range or airspace must be
coordinated with 56 RMO/ASMS and the 56 RMO/QAE (COR) offices at GBAFAF (see
paragraph 1.2.4.2). Day of scheduling will be coordinated through Snakeye (Chapter 7).
1.6.1. Mission / Event Priority. Airspace/range requirements are allocated with the following
priorities in mind:

Table 1.1. Mission / Event Priority.

1. Higher headquarters missions (e.g. ORI), AEF pre-deployment (US forces)

2. WTI, ORE, and LFE

3. Tanker associated requirements (not the track)

4. Missions supported by deployed DACT assets

5. Wing weapons competitions

6. Regular User requests
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             9


7. Casual User requests

1.6.1.1. The above hierarchy of events involve higher levels of coordination, possible funding,
and a wing‘s commitment, resulting in a priority ranking for airspace. Once the major events are
annotated on the 3-week out range shell, the rotating wing/unit priority system drives the 2-week
schedule build process.
1.6.1.2. LFE airspace allocation defined.
1.6.1.2.1. LFEs are a routine event for the 56 FW units. Approximately every 8 weeks, one of
the F-16 B-Course classes enters the LFE Phase. The minimum airspace required for the SAT-7
B-Course LFE is 70 minutes of SELLS ABCDE and 60 minutes of Air-to-Air, NTAC, STAC,
and Range 1. Additional airspace will be allocated to the LFE as long as it doesn‘t impact
another unit‘s PFT. (for example adding manned ranges for overflight).
1.6.1.2.2. Continuation Training LFE airspace is typically allocated as 60 minutes in two
varieties or options: A/A, NTAC, STAC, Range 1 and SELLS ABCDE or all of SELLS
(ABCDE) and ETAC. Additional airspace will be allocated to the LFE as long as it doesn‘t
impact another unit‘s PFT. (for example adding manned ranges for overflight).
1.6.1.2.3. When one tactical range is closed for cleanup, the BMGR East may be limited to one
LFE per day, depending upon airspace availability. If it appears likely that the BMGR East
cannot support an LFE, the requestor will be notified as soon as possible.
1.6.2. Primary user priority. The 56 RMO uses a rotating priority status centered around the 56
FW (six F-16 units), 355 FW (three A-10 units), and 162 FW (three F-16 units) as the ‗Priority
Wing‘ for a given week. The wing afforded top priority one week, moves to the second position
the following week, the third position the week after that and back to the first position again.
This results in a wing being in the top position every third week, as depicted in:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=5130053.
1.6.2.1. ANG AFRC Test Center (AATC) Priority. The 162 FW incorporates the AATC range
request with their respective squadron requests. AATC is aligned with the 162 FW rotating
priority. Rarely, a special test must be accommodated. When this happens, the AATC discusses
their requirements with the 56 RMO/DO and their priority may be HHQ directed. This will then
be put on the schedule shell 3-weeks out and then the normal rotating priority will be used to
build the range schedule.
1.6.2.2. 162 Operation Snowbird (OSB) Priority. OSB is a National Guard Bureau program
designed to support northern tier ANG (primary), Navy, Marine Corps, and foreign military
service units. Snowbird is aligned with 162 FW rotating priority.
1.6.2.2.1. ANG units being supported by the OSB specifically for AEF pre-deployment training
will receive priority 1 status per 1.6.1., above as a regular user for use of BMGR East Complex
provided 56 RMO/ASMS is given a minimum of 45 days prior notice. Note: When less than 45
days notice is given, 56 RMO will make every effort to accommodate however, status cannot be
guaranteed.
1.6.2.2.2. OSB hosted US units, other than AEF pre-deployment, for example, other ANG, other
U.S. military services will be afforded regular user status IAW 1.6.2.2., above.
 10                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


1.6.2.2.3. OSB hosted international or friendly foreign nation units will be afforded regular
status but will not necessarily have priority over primary regular users (USAF/NG). Given
situation, foreign military units will be supported to the maximum extent possible.
1.6.2.2.4. OSB hosted international or friendly foreign nation units will be charged range usage
fees per the United States Code, Title 22, Chapter 39 Arms Export Control Act. Coordination
and arrangements to include funds transfer must be finalized prior to foreign operations within
the BMGR East Complex.
1.6.2.2.5. Due to the BMGR East user demand/request dynamics it is incumbent on OSB to
coordinate and communicate hosting schedules as far in advance as possible. In particular, in-
coming units with special requirements, for example, special weapons need to coordinated with
56 RMO/ARO during deployment planning; BMGR East Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC)
ground parties scheduling occurs in many cases a year in advance—OSB should reference the 56
RMO JTAC schedule at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E when determining level of
support capability. Based on previously scheduled special request range operations, 56 FW/RMO
may not be able to fully support OSB requests.
1.6.2.3. 563 RQG Priority. The 563 RQG directs flying operations dedicated to Combat Search
and Rescue (CSAR) and is physically located at Davis-Monthan AFB. The group supports the
55 RQS (HH-60) and 79 RQS (HC-130) that utilize the BMGR East complex. The 355 WG
forwards the 55 RQS and 79 RQS range requests with their A-10 squadron requests. The 563
RQG requests are aligned with the 355 FW rotating priority.
1.6.2.4. 305 RQS Priority. AFRES CSAR HH-60 unit located at Davis-Monthan AFB. Their
requests are aligned with the 355 WG rotating priority if submitted prior to the Build process.
1.6.2.5. 1-285th AHBE Priority. The 1-285th (AH-64) occasionally requests tactical ranges for
table qualification training. These requests typically are for extended periods (> 8 hours). The
section chief will discuss requirements with the RMO/DO and determine the level of support the
BMGR East can accommodate. Typically, this unit will have to accomplish their gunnery
requirements on a weekend (contractor call-out as required). Accommodating requests is on a
case by case basis.
1.6.2.6. WAATS Priority. WAATS (AH-64 / OH-58) typically request ranges for basic gunnery
training every seven weeks. Normally, WAATS operates on Range 3, Range 4, ETAC or NTAC
in that order, based on availability. They are not aligned with anyone for priority, however given
flexibility are normally accommodated.
1.6.2.7. Peace Vanguard Priority. Peace Vanguard (AH-64) is a Long Term Stationing (20+
years) and Cooperative Agreement between the Republic of Singapore and the US Government.
Peace Vanguard occasionally requests tactical ranges for operational training. These requests
typically are for extended periods (> 8 hours). The section chief will discuss requirements with
the RMO/DO and determine the level of support the BMGR East can accommodate. Typically,
this unit will have to accomplish their gunnery requirements on a weekend (contractor call-out as
required). Accommodating requests is on a case by case basis.
1.6.3. Scheduling process.
1.6.3.1. Range         Request        suspenses      are                   published           at:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=5130053.
     AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               11


     1.6.3.2. Priority Swaps. Typically, wings will swap priorities to accommodate important events.
     As a courtesy to the other Regular Users, units requesting airspace to support an ORE or LFE
     events that do not fall on a week where their wing is Priority #1
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=5130053, should submit their airspace
     request/requirements 30 days or more in advance to facilitate coordination efforts between the
     appropriate Current Ops offices.
     1.6.3.3. Major event requests. Regular Users submit range requests for major events Large
     Force Employment (LFE), Operational Readiness Exercise (ORE), tanker associated missions,
     aerial competitions (Turkey Shoot), etc., at least 3 weeks in advance. 56 RMO/ASMS reviews
     all medium to long-range forecasts for potential conflicts and will notify the requesting unit(s) if
     the range schedule cannot accommodate the requested event a high enough priority to guarantee
     the desired airspace (first-come first-served).
     1.6.3.4. All non-major event Regular User range requests are due 2-weeks out.
     1.6.3.5. Priority Application in the Schedule Build Process. Unit requests are collated relative to
     their priority. Priority 1 units will be scheduled as close to requested times as possible. Priority
     2 units are accommodated next and finally, the third priority units are allocated remaining range
     times. Third priority units are harder to accommodate requested range times and can be an hour
     or two earlier or later than requested. When two or more units request the same ranges at or near
     the same time, the lower priority unit (according to the rotating priority order) is moved to a
     different time (can be earlier or later). This process results in the higher priority unit receiving
     range times as close to their request as possible.
     1.6.3.6. Priority does not mean that the top priority units get all the ranges they ask for and the
     third priority gets nothing. 56 RMO/ASMS will attempt to divide the ranges up equitably.
     1.6.3.7. It takes 2.5 workdays to build a range schedule for a calendar week. Typically, once
     built it will be published to the 56 RMO Scheduling CoP website by 1200L on a Wednesday.
     Range Wars is conducted on Thursday of a typical week and the revised draft published
     following the meeting (11 days out).
     1.6.3.8. Individual wings deconflict their own respective units.
     1.6.3.9. Range Confirmations. All users will call (DSN 896-7654 / 3330 / 8466) to confirm the
     next day‘s schedule by 1000L, or the afternoon 2-days prior if night flying. Airspace/Ranges not
     confirmed will be made available (shown as unscheduled) to the other users. When confirming
     airspace/ranges, the following information is required:

     Table 1.2. Confirmation Information.

1.          Range/airspace time

2.          #of aircraft (type of aircraft too--if a casual user)

3.          If MARSA with another unit, # and type aircraft they are providing
4.          Laser use (for ground personnel safety – eye protection is signed out based on the
         confirmed schedule)
      12                                               AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


5.            Live (HE) ordnance. This is for both safety of ground personnel and it triggers the
           requirement for Sonoran Pronghorn Monitors for NTAC and/or STAC.

6.            JDAM ordnance, both inert and Live (HE). This is due to the large footprint. Snakeye
           prohibits unauthorized ground parties near the impact area for this munition.
     1.6.3.10. Based on input a final schedule will be published by 1400L in Center Scheduling
     Enterprise (CSE) https://cseaf.eglin.af.mil/cse/home.aspx. Units may request the schedule via
     email by submitting your request to 56rmo.bmgrscheduling@luke.af.mil.
     1.6.4. Range Restrictions.   Range          scheduling   publishes   the   Range    NOTAMs      at:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E .
     1.6.5. Additional scheduling considerations.
     1.6.5.1. JTAC employment, Drop Zone use, Assault Zone operations, ground employment,
     special type operations at GBAFAF and unique test requirements downrange are among the
     events requiring prior coordination and advanced approval. This list is not all inclusive. Contact
     the 56 RMO/ARO and 56 RMO/ASMS for coordination as required.
     1.6.5.2. Ground Access Request. Refer to Chapter 6.
     1.6.5.2. Specific Ordnance/LASER Requirements. Coordinate Live Drops/Live Fire/inert GBU-
     24/31/32/38 deliveries and combat laser use a minimum 24 hours prior to the day of the mission
     when the sortie(s) occurs on a weekday (M-F) and 7 days in advance to the mission date when
     the sortie(s) will occur on a weekend (S/S) or holiday. Employment of high explosive (HE)
     ordnance, inert GBU-24/31/32/38, or combat LASER is not authorized unless annotated as such
     on the range schedule. Some ordnance requires scheduling multiple areas to comply with WDZ
     Tool/SAFE-RANGE footprint restrictions.
     1.6.5.2.1. Users that wish to employ munitions not listed in this supplement as authorized
     ordnance will consult 56 RMO/ARO in advance to ensure that the munitions are approved for
     use on the targets selected for employment and that Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
     clearance teams are advised of the presence of these munitions and trained on any peculiar
     hazards they may present. Written approval of 56 RMO/DIR is required for dropping live
     ordnance not included in the authorized ordnance in Attachment 3.
     1.6.5.2.2. Live AGM-65/AGM-114 Scheduling. Email Maverick/Hellfire requirements to
     56RMO.BMGRscheduling@luke.af.mil a minimum 45 days out; preferably 60 days out.
     Required information includes total number, type (variant) of AGM, desired employment dates
     and the unit‘s POC for transferring funds (for target expense).
     1.6.5.2.2.1. Lead time requirement. AGM targets are built (wood tank facsimile) by contract in
     lots of 6. 56 RMO requires 45 day prior notice in order to affect target build-up. Assessing the
     range calendar and coordinating EOD personnel to support contract maintenance drives the lead
     time. Typically, target build-up is done on a non-fly weekend and it may take 4-5 weeks at
     certain times of the year to have an open weekend date to build targets.
     1.6.5.2.2.2. Once support is determined (where, when, cost) 56 RMO will advise the requestor.
     If the plan is agreeable, units will MIPR funds to 56 RMO Resource Advisor PRIOR to the
     projected target build date. Once funds are received, the contractor will be issued a Notice to
     Proceed.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                           13


1.6.5.2.2.3. Once targets are placed they become property of DoD. If one or more targets are
not destroyed, we do not issue refunds.
1.6.5.2.2.4. ETAC is the preferred range since there are no endangered species restrictions.
Users must schedule Range 3 overflight to get aligned on the appropriate delivery axis.
1.6.5.2.2.5. NTAC is the secondary range and STAC is the tertiary range for AGM employment.
Each are constrained by common factors. Due to the location of T123, STAC range is required
to be co-scheduled with NTAC. Scheduling two tactical ranges for one mission can be a
problematic and limits overall range availability during peak demand. NTAC and STAC are
inhabited by Sonoran pronghorn antelope (endangered species) which could close the target on
any given day.
1.6.5.3. Casual user LFE missions. Casual user/hosted unit LFE mission commanders must
receive briefing from the RMO/DO or a designated representative prior to execution. Contact
RMO/DO a minimum of 1-week prior for coordination.
1.6.6. AR-603, AR-658 and AR-647 Scheduling: Units schedule AR-603, AR-658 and AR-647
tracks through 56 OSS/OSOS (Current Ops DSN 896-7193) for dates more than two weeks out
from schedule build (not execution date). Inside of two weeks (schedule build in process) the 56
RMO/ASMS is the scheduling POC for the above AR Tracks. GLADDEN/BAGDAD and
SELLS MOA missions are a higher priority than the use of AR-603 or AR-647 which can impact
training in SUA. When scheduling conflicts exist between SUA and AR tracks, the SUA
missions take priority.
1.6.6.1. AR-647A Scheduling. AR-647A is scheduled directly with Range Scheduling. AR-
647A lies entirely within the SELLS MOA and will be utilized only for 355 FW (Davis-
Monthan) A-10 night refueling training unless specifically approved by the 56 RMO. SELLS
MOA missions are a higher priority than the use of AR-647A. If there are no SELLS MOA
conflicts, the 355 FW will be accommodated to the maximum extent possible.
1.7. Daily Operations Oversight. Daily operations are under the supervision of the ROCC
located at Luke AFB, AZ. ROCC specifics are defined in paragraph 2.6.
1.8. Maintenance. The 56 RMO is responsible for maintenance of BMGR East. Scheduled
dates for range maintenance are coordinated by the contractor to be published annually NLT 1
August of each year. The latest forecast range maintenance schedule may be found linked from
the Range Scheduling Homepage at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E.
1.8.1. 150 Use-day Closure. Manned ranges are normally scheduled for a 150 use-day ordnance
disposal on a Thursday and Friday, as required.
1.8.2. Annual Closure. Manned and tactical ranges are scheduled for an annual ordnance
disposal each year. Ordinarily, annual clearances require 7 weeks (tactical ranges) or 2 weeks
(manned ranges). Typically, about 2 weeks are free between one ordnance disposal and the next.
Based on Sonoran pronghorn considerations and USMC WTI the standard cycle is: Nov-Mar
NTAC/STAC; May-June: ETAC; manned ranges spaced throughout the year. Actual closure
dates/periods may change.        Refer to the EOD/MX schedule (per FY) posted at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E.
1.9. Range Clearance and EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Operations. Under the 56th
Civil Engineering Squadron (56 CES), the Chief, EOD Flight (56 CES/CED), is responsible for
 14                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


providing range clearance and EOD support for BMGR. 56 CES/CED is responsible for
providing qualified personnel to conduct EOD Safety Briefings, upon unit commander‘s request,
according to this publication. 56 CES/CED is responsible for determining if weather and fire
hazard conditions preclude safe EOD operations. Detailed plans for each range clearance
operation will be established by the EOD Team Chief. Changes to range maintenance schedules
will be coordinated with 56 CES/CED to permit proper EOD planning/scheduling.
1.9.1. Detonation Scheduling Procedures. 56 CES/CED will notify 56 RMO/ASMS no later
than a day prior to detonations (typically accomplished on Thursdays), so that an appropriate
Range NOTAM can be published at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E.
1.10. Environmental Resources. The 56 RMO/ESM will assess any new operation/
construction to determine if an environmental impact assessment is required, manage the land
and natural resources to promote environmental protection consistent with meeting the current
and future military missions, serve as focal point for non-military organizations having an
interest in the natural and cultural resources of the BMGR, and conduct meetings as required to
review resource concerns of the BMGR.
1.10.1. Endangered Species. Two federally listed endangered species occur on BMGR East,
along with six Arizona wildlife concerns and two highly safeguarded plant species. Of these, the
Sonoran pronghorn is of greatest concern. It is a federally listed endangered species;
approximately 95 percent of its existing distribution in the US is in the Cabeza Prieta National
Wildlife Refuge (CPNWR) and on the BMGR East and West. An ongoing monitoring program
is in place to minimize the risk of injury or mortality to pronghorn in accordance with the
Endangered Species Act (ESA). Management actions for the other federal- and state-listed
species do not have operational impacts; these actions are specified in the Integrated Natural
Resources Management Plan (INRMP) and are implemented by 56 RMO/ESM staff.
1.10.2. Pilots and ground personnel will abide by all Sonoran pronghorn rules (closed targets,
speed limits) IAW 56 RMO OI 13-1. A captive breeding area is located in Childs Valley within
the Cabeza Prieta at N 32° 22.648‘ W 113° 01.187‘ MGRS 12S UA 0999 8407. The captive
breeding plot is approximately 1 square statute mile and pilots should avoid overflight unless on
an MTR.
1.10.3. Sonoran Pronghorn (SPH) Antelope Clearances. 56 RMO contract personnel will
monitor for SPH IAW the SPH Biological Opinion and Operating Instruction. The monitoring
will take place during daylight only, as the first event of the day on the scheduled range. If a
SPH is detected within 1.5 km of either NTAC/STAC HE Hill/live maverick target, no high
explosive ordnance deliveries will be authorized on the affected target. For all other targets if a
SPH is detected within 1 km of a target, the target group will be closed to weapons delivery for
the remainder of the day.
1.11. Safety. The 56 RMO is responsible for all safety aspects of range and SUA operations.
The Chief of Safety (56 FW/SE) conducts periodic safety reviews of GBAFAF. 56 FW/SE will,
as needed, monitor, investigate, and coordinate with concerned/involved units, all reports of
violations, incidents, or accidents in BMGR East, which affect safety of air or ground operations.
1.11.1. Range Incidents. Range incidents (internal airspace violations, ground intrusions,
unintentional release, etc.) will be reported by anyone on the range (ground) or in the airspace
(pilot). All incidents should be reported to Snakeye/RCO to document. Snakeye or RCO will
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             15


document on the BMGR East Incident Report (Attachment 4) and forward to the appropriate
agencies within 3 hours. When incidents occur, a phone call will be made within 1 hour of the
incident to 56 RMO/DO/ARO.
1.11.2. 56 RMO will provide both initial response and follow-on support for all range incidents
within BMGR East IAW 56 RMO applicable OIs.
1.11.3. Airspace violations. All airspace violations will be logged by Snakeye and reported to
ASM as soon as possible. 56 RMO/ASM will investigate and process appropriate action for the
violation.
1.11.4. Emergency response.
1.11.4.1. BMGR East is a very remote operating area. Medical attention is limited to first
response stabilization. Serious injuries will require transport to the Phoenix metropolitan area
for treatment. GBAFAF fire department will coordinate transportation either by ambulance or
medical evacuation helicopter. Typically, civilian contract helicopter medivac will respond to an
accident. If necessary, military search and rescue assets from Davis-Monthan AFB or MCAS
Yuma can be requested for response.
1.11.4.2. Ground party injury. If any person on the ground is injured downrange, notify
Snakeye or ECC for assistance. Snakeye will notify the ECC; ECC will notify GBAFAF fire
and security; fire and/or EMT support will respond as needed. At a minimum, GBAFAF
security will respond.
1.11.4.3. Aircraft accident. Aircraft accidents may be reported by ground party (e.g., JTAC,
RCO) or pilot. Reporting should be to Snakeye, for initial support assessment. Snakeye will
advise respective command posts of an aircraft accident.                Other avenues of
reporting/communication are GBAFAF tower, security, and respective Supervisor of Flying
(SOF). Snakeye will assist on scene commander as much as possible and direct traffic as the
situation warrants. The GBAFAF emergency management team will convene upon notification
of an aircraft accident within BMGR East. GBAFAF fire, medical and security will respond to
aircraft accidents.
1.11.4.4. Fire suppression responsibilities. The 56 RMO is responsible for fire response at
GBAFAF and on BMGR East. Ultimate fire suppression responsibility lies with the GBAFAF
fire chief. GBAFAF fire fighting procedures will be IAW AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency
Services Program, 9 Sep 2008 and Fire Protection Management Plan 32. For wildland fires,
NFPA 1500, Standard on Fire Department Occupational Safety and Health Program, 2007, and
the 56 RMO—BLM memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding fire support applies.
Each manned range is equipped with limited (fire extinguisher) capability. In the event of
incident or fire, the RCO/Snakeye will notify the ECC. Depending on location and situation the
GBAFAF fire department will respond or the fire will be monitored. In the event of a wildland
fire situation: the fire will be monitored, responded to if necessary, and if required the Arizona
state fire office will be notified in accordance with MOU AZ-200-0517.
1.12. Annual Range Board. The BMGR East Annual Range Board will be convened yearly
typically in late spring. 56 RMO/DO is the OPR for the Annual Range Board.
1.12.1. Members. Except when otherwise designated by the board chairman, the following are
the members of the BMGR Board:

1.13. Arizona Area of Responsibility (AOR) Special Instructions (SPINS). Arizona AOR
SPINS review will be held in conjunction with the annual range board as outlined in paragraph
1.12. 355 FW/OG maintains ownership of the SPINS, and therefore will take the lead for the
review process during the annual range board meeting.
1.13.1. SPINS Content. The Arizona AOR SPINS provide standard procedures to be used by
units executing or controlling interdiction, close air support, or combat search and rescue training
missions in BMGR East. The SPINS represent procedures used in a cross-section of AORs.
Units will comply with the SPINS when working with other BMGR East users unless
coordinated with the participating unit(s). If any doubt exists, use clear communications to
immediately resolve any potential conflicts.
1.13.2. SPINS Location. The Arizona AOR SPINS can be obtained by contacting the 355
OSS/OSK at DSN 228-4960 or COMM 580-228-4960.
1.14. Reports.
1.14.1. Utilization/Reporting Information Requirements.
1.14.1.1. Airspace utilization. Snakeye will log airspace entry and exit times for all users within
BMGR East.
1.14.1.2. Weapons expenditures. All users of the BMGR East will report all weapons
expenditures on tactical ranges to Snakeye upon check-out from the airspace; Snakeye operators
will log expenditures into CSE. For manned range users RCOs will log weapons expenditures
into CSE.
1.14.1.3. Aircrew will advise Snakeye of any unusual airspace or range restriction (e.g., ground
party, pronghorn sighting, etc.) that adversely affected the mission. Snakeye will log IAW
paragraph 7.3.3 and provide amplifying information to 56 RMO (DO/ASM/ARO) as required.
1.14.1.4. Supersonic tracking. 56 FW pilots will log all supersonic activity in Graduate Training
Integration Management Systems (GTIMS). Any off-base user will report any unauthorized
supersonic activity to 56 RMO/ASM (623-856-5855, DSN 896).
1.14.2. Utilization/Reporting Requirements.

                                            Chapter 2

         BMGR EAST DESCRIPTION / CAPABILITIES AND INFORMATION

2.1. General. All casual/hosted units must receive a range orientation briefing prior to range
utilization. Aircrews must have the most current edition of this supplement in their possession
for mission planning and will review 56 RMO range NOTAMs. Strict adherence to ordnance,
target, and LASER restrictions is essential. Additionally, the restricted areas are subdivided for
multiple simultaneous uses. Proper area entry/exit procedures and maintaining flight within
scheduled airspace are crucial to flight and ground safety.
2.1.1. Internal subdivisions to BMGR East include an Air Combat/Aerial Gunnery range ―Air-
to-Air (AA)‖, three air-to-ground tactical employment ranges ―NORTH, SOUTH, EAST
TACTICAL‖ (NTAC, STAC, ETAC), four manned bombing ranges, ―Ranges 1, 2, 3, 4‖ and
SELLS MOA/ATCAA A/B/C/D illustrated at Figure 2.1. Refer to Chapters 3 and 4 for
specific range information. Although not included in special use airspace, BMGR East includes
drop/assault zones (DZ/LZ) and GBAFAF. Refer to paragraph 2.5 for DZ/LZ information and
Chapter 8 for GBAFAF information.

Figure 2.1. BMGR East Area and Sub Ranges.




2.1.2. Altitudes. Unless stated otherwise, all altitudes given in this supplement are in feet above
Mean Sea Level (MSL). Use the GBAFAF altimeter when operating within BMGR East.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                          19


2.1.3. Coordinate Conversions. Airspace boundaries and target locations are defined by WGS–
84 NAD 83 coordinates in degrees, minutes, decimal minutes.
2.1.4. Avoid maneuvering within 500‘ of any vertical boundary. This provides 1,000‘ vertical
separation between aircraft. Avoid maneuvering within 2 NM of restricted area borders.
Exception: avoid maneuvering within 2.5 NM of the R-2301E/W border. Live Aerial Gunnery
missions should also avoid internal borders by at least 2 NM.
2.1.5. Weather Requirements. The minimum weather requirements for range operations will be
IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, and specific Mission Design Series
(MDS) guidance. Administrative Maneuvering: Aircrew are allowed to transit IMC in
scheduled restricted airspace without an ATC clearance (an ATC clearance is required to transit
MOAs/ATCAAs IMC). Tactical Maneuvering: Due to the complex nature of airspace
subdivisions all tactical maneuvering will operate under VFR in the BMGR East. Exceptions
will be considered and must be approved by 56 RMO/DIR to accommodate IMC intercept
training and or IMC weapons delivery (restricted areas only).
2.2. Restricted Airspace.
2.2.1. R-2301E. R-2301E is airspace defined by Arizona SR 85 on the east and the Mohawk
Mountains to the west between I-8 and the US-Mexican border. The western boundary of R-
2301E is adjacent to R-2301W. R-2301E extends from the surface to 80,000‘, except over the
CPNWR, where a 1,500‘ AGL restriction exists when not on a scheduled MTR. R-2301E is
authorized for unrestricted supersonic operations above 5,000‘ MSL, except over the manned
ranges, where supersonic is restricted to above 10,000‘ AGL. The entire R-2301E area is
activated for any use of AA, NTAC, STAC, manned Ranges 1, 2, or 4. R-2301E boundaries are:

N 32 50.000   W 112 49.000   to
N 32 12.000   W 112 57.000   to
N 32 12.000   W 113 06.000   to
N 31 58.000   W 113 06.000   along the US/Mexico border to
N 32 06.000   W 113 31.000   to
N 32 44.000   W 113 41.000   to
N 32 46.000   W 113 35.000   to the beginning.


2.2.2. R-2305. R-2305 consists of the airspace over and out to 7 NM east of Arizona SR 85
between the town of Ajo and GBAFAF. R-2305 extends from the surface to 24,000‘. R-2305 is
authorized for subsonic operations only. R-2305 is activated for any use of manned ranges 1, 2,
or 3. R-2305 boundaries are:

N 32 50.000   W 112 49.000   to
N 32 51.000   W 112 43.000   to
N 32 49.000   W 112 39.000   to
N 32 29.000   W 112 43.000   to
N 32 29.000   W 112 54.000   to the beginning.

2.2.3. R-2304. R-2304 consists of the airspace east of R-2305, southeast of Gila Bend, AZ. R-
2304 underlies the SELLS ATCAA and overlies both military managed land as well as Native
American land. R-2304 extends from the surface to 24,000‘. R-2304 is authorized for subsonic
operations only. R-2304 is activated for any use of ETAC and/or Range 3 (see paragraph 4.14
for specific ETAC information). R-2304 boundaries are:

N 32 39.000    W 112 18.000   to
N 32 27.000    W 112 18.000   to
N 32 27.000    W 112 44.000   to
N 32 49.000    W 112 39.000   to the beginning.

2.2.4. Restricted area entry/exit. IFR entry is via ARSON, NOLLS, or BUGGS. IFR exit is via
ARSON, BUGGS or COOLY, Figure 2.2 (also see Attachment 5 for waypoint coordinates).
VFR entry/exit is via military training route (entry only) or VFR altitudes. Specific range
entry/exit procedures are located in Chapter 3/4.
2.2.5. General Aviation/Air Evacuation Corridor. This corridor transects R-2301E and R-2305
extending from GBAFAF to the Ajo Airport along Arizona SR 85 to afford civilian traffic
restricted airspace transit, military operations permitting. Crossing altitudes are 500‘ AGL (day)
and 1,000‘ AGL (night). VFR rules govern civilian flights through the BMGR East. Civilian air
evacuation flights (―Lifeguard‖) will be given priority over all other air traffic except in-flight
emergencies. The ―Air Evac‖ call sign (USAF) will be used only when the aircraft is on an
actual air evacuation mission. Arizona Department of Public Safety "Ranger" call signs must
indicate they are on an air evacuation mission to receive priority. Military aircraft on manned
ranges will be instructed to remain clear of Arizona SR 85 or to transit the highway 1000‘ above
the air evacuation/general aviation aircraft.
2.2.5.1. Corridor Activation. If routine traffic, Snakeye will restrict civilian access until de-
confliction is assured with scheduled ranges; once de-conflicted Snakeye will advise GBAFAF
tower and manned ranges for awareness. If priority flight IAW above, Snakeye will advise
RCOs on the manned ranges and GBAFAF tower prior to activating the General Aviation/Air
Evacuation Corridor. RCOs will in turn advise/restrict manned range operations until the traffic
has passed.

2.3. SELLS MOA/ATCAA (Figure 2.3). The SELLS MOA/ATCAA can be used individually
or in conjunction with flight operations within the BMGR restricted areas, or as a transit route to
and from the Tucson area. The ATCAA overlies R-2304 and R-2305, and is subdivided into five
parts, A, B, C, D, and E and the Ajo transition and also includes AR 647/647A. SELLS A and B
are usually assigned together, and constitute the northern half of SELLS. SELLS C, D, and E are
usually assigned together, and constitute the southern half of SELLS. The airspace is further
subdivided vertically as SELLS Low and SELLS 1 MOA/ATCAA (Figure 2.3). SELLS
MOA/ATCAA boundaries are:
N 32 50.000    W 112 45.000   to
N 32 51.000    W 112 43.000   to
N 32 15.167    W 111 36.000   to
N 31 58.000    W 111 36.500   to
N 31 49.000    W 111 32.000   to
N 31 43.500    W 111 38.500   to
N 31 31.000    W 111 38.500   to
N 31 58.000    W 113 05.500   to
N 32 11.500    W 113 05.500   to
N 32 11.500    W 112 56.750   to the beginning
2.3.1. Special Considerations. SELLS MOA overlies two noise sensitive areas, the Tohono
O‘odham Nation and the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Strict adherence to directives
 22                                            AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


is essential to respecting the concerns of and maintaining a good working relationship with the
residents and managers of these areas. Supersonic flight in SELLS A-E is authorized above
10,000‘ MSL and will be directed away from villages. Supersonic flight is not authorized within
5 miles of Ajo, Hickiwan, Vaya Chin, Sells, and the Kitt Peak Observatory. Avoid overflight of
Kitt Peak. Avoid Baboquivari Peak by 3 NM.

Figure 2.3. SELLS MOA/ATCAA; Subdivision Coordinates.




2.3.2. SELLS MOA/ATCAA Altitudes. The MOA extends from 3000‘ AGL to 17,999‘ MSL.
The SELLS Low MOA is a subset of the overall MOA under A/B/C/D/E from 3,000‘ AGL to
9,500‘ MSL. SELLS 1 MOA extends from 10,000‘ MSL to 17,999‘ MSL. The SELLS ATCAA
extends from 18,000‘ to 51,000‘. (Note: depending on scheduled use of SELLS subsection
airspace, the 500‘ buffer is not applicable.)
2.3.2.1. SELLS 1 MOA A/B. SELLS A/B begins at 10,000‘ MSL unless low airspace is
specifically scheduled. A/B Low can be scheduled under special circumstances. SELLS A is
restricted over R-2304 and R-2305 to 25,000‘ and above.
2.3.2.2. SELLS 1 MOA C/D/E. SELLS C/D/E begins at 10,000‘ MSL.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            23


2.3.2.3. Typically SELLS A/B, SELLS C/D/E are grouped respectively for simultaneous but
different use. Subdivisions may be scheduled separately or in different configurations depending
on mission requirements. SELLS A/B is commonly scheduled with R-2304 (ETAC) and/or the
SELLS MOA/ATCAA is scheduled in conjunction with R-2301E. SELLS E may be scheduled
with SELLS C/D or R-2301E.
2.3.2.4. SELLS A/B Low. SELLS A/B Low begin at 3,000‘ AGL and extend up to and
including 9,500‘ MSL. SELLS A/B is typically reserved for use as a transit area for traffic to
and from the Tucson area as well as low altitude tactical navigation (any aircraft 250 kts and
below). More specifically 7,500‘ MSL—9,500‘ MSL is designated as primary east-west transit
block. A-10 aircraft may be present in the confines of SELLS A/B up to 7,499‘ MSL
accomplishing G checks. SELLS A/B Low will not normally be scheduled for individual flight
use, however when required (e.g., LFE), will be scheduled and published via range NOTAM
(during scheduled times the transition area is N/A and access to the airspace is reserved only to
using flight).
2.3.2.5. SELLS C/D/E Low. SELLS C/D/E Low begin at 3,000‘ AGL and extend up to and
including 9,500‘ MSL. It is normally scheduled in conjunction with SELLS C/D/E high
airspace.
2.3.3. SELLS MOA/ATCAA Activation.
2.3.3.1. The SELLS MOA/ATCAA is activated 1 hour prior to the first scheduled SELLS
mission, and is deactivated 1 hour after the last scheduled SELLS mission.
2.3.3.2. SELLS Low MOA‘s. The entire SELLS Low MOA is activated 1 hour prior to the first
Tucson/ Davis-Monthan AFB mission scheduled into the BMGR, and is not closed until 1 hour
after the last mission on the BMGR. Additionally, the Low MOA is activated one hour prior to
the first scheduled mission in SELLS C/D/E Low, until 1 hour after the last mission in SELLS
C/D/E Low. The 500‘ buffer between LOW and HIGH MOAs exists unless a unit has scheduled
both simultaneously.
2.3.4. SELLS, AAHI, STAC and Range 1 Deconfliction. Extreme caution must be used by
flights operating in SELLS, AAHI, and STAC when AR-647 is active. Air refueling missions
above 17,999‘ use the standard altimeter setting of 29.92, while flights in SELLS, AAHI, and
STAC use the GBAFAF local altimeter setting.
2.3.5. Ajo Transition. The Ajo transition (Figure 2.2) is a VFR means to traverse from north to
SELLS C/D/E or the eastern portion of R 2301-E and vice versa. Routing southbound is
NOLLS-Black Gap-town of Ajo at odd VFR hemispheric altitudes (Note: BMGR East IFR entry
from the north will be via NOLLS at 8,000‘ MSL). Routing northbound is Ajo-Black Gap-
COOLY at even VFR hemispheric altitudes. Transition altitudes are from 10.5K MSL to 14.5K
MSL. Coordinate deconfliction with SELLS A/B and avoid manned ranges by 5 NM. If below
10,000‘ MSL pilots must coordinate with manned ranges 1, 2, and 3 for deconfliction.
2.3.6. SELLS MOA/ATCAA Entry/Exit.
2.3.6.1. North entry. Normal entry is through BUGGS at 9000‘ MSL or as assigned. Use
caution for departing traffic at 7,500‘-8,000‘ MSL (BUGGS) and crossing east-west traffic at
even/odd VFR hemispheric attitudes below 10,000‘ MSL.
 24                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


2.3.6.2. East entry. Normal entry is through either KITT at 8500‘ MSL or WHISKEY between
7500‘ and 9500‘ MSL or as assigned.
2.3.6.3. Flights desiring to enter SELLS above 10,000‘ MSL must confirm SELLS A/B is cold
or deconflict with using flight prior to request. Luke RAPCON/ABQ ARTCC IAW LOA must
approve block altitudes for entry.
2.3.6.4. SELLS C/D/E entry. Normal entry from the north is through BUGGS at 9,000‘ MSL.
Flight(s) will remain at 9,000‘ MSL until the lateral limits of SELLS C/D/E unless coordinated
and deconflicted with SELLS A/B traffic.
2.3.6.4.1. Normal entry from the east is through KITT at 8500‘ MSL or SIERRA at 7500‘ or
9500‘ MSL. (Note: A-10s may enter VFR from the Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN)
area.)
2.3.6.4.2. Flights may also enter via the Ajo transition IAW paragraph 2.3.5. Normal IFR
point of entry is NOLLS at 8,000‘ MSL.
2.3.6.4.3. Flights exiting SELLS to the north (BUGGS) will be at 8,000‘ MSL within 10 NM of
BUGGS to deconflict with entering and crossing traffic. Use caution for entering traffic at 9000‘
MSL (BUGGS) and crossing east-west traffic at even/odd VFR hemispheric attitudes below
10,000‘ MSL.
2.3.6.4.4. Flights exiting SELLS to the east (KITT/WHISKEY/SIERRA) will depart between
7500‘ and 9500‘ MSL.
2.3.6.4.5. SELLS C/D/E exits via the Ajo transition will depart at 8,000‘ MSL unless
coordinated with SELLS A/B traffic. Comply with paragraph 2.3.5.
2.4. AR-647/AR-647A (Figure 2.3).
2.4.1. AR-647. The AR-647 refueling track overlies SELLS and the southeast portion of AAHI
and STAC. When activated, AR-647 restricts the use of SELLS, AAHI and STAC and will be
posted in the Range NOTAMs.
2.4.1.1. AR-647 Deconfliction. SELLS, AAHI, and STAC missions must remain at least 1,000‘
above or below the AR-647 block. AR-647 Low-block extends from 10,000‘ to 17,000‘ MSL;
AR-647 Mid-block FL180 to FL230; AR-647 High-block FL 240 to FL290. The High and Low
blocks will not be scheduled simultaneously. On rare occasions the Low and Mid or Mid and
High blocks may be scheduled simultaneously. When AR-647 is active all flights scheduled to
work in SELLS, AAHI and STAC airspace will confirm BMGR range NOTAMs with Snakeye.
All aircraft operating above 10,000‘ MSL will squawk mode IIIC.
2.4.2. AR-647A (Figure 2.3). The AR-647A track overlies the SELLS MOA and when
activated, restricts other SELLS MOA users to 15,000‘ MSL and above.
2.4.2.1. AR-647A is restricted to nighttime refueling for 355 FW A-10‘s only.
2.4.2.2. AR-647A extends from 10,000‘ to 14,000‘ MSL.
2.4.2.3. AR-647A will not be scheduled when AR-647 ‗low‘ or ‗medium‘ blocks are scheduled.
2.4.3. AR-647 and AR-647A Entry/Exit Procedures. All military flights using AR-647/647A
are under Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA) flight rules. To
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                           25


avoid possible conflicts with aircraft entering/exiting AR-647/AR-647A and aircraft operating in
SELLS MOA, AAHI and STAC airspace, the following procedures will be adhered to:
2.4.3.1. Tanker aircraft will notify Albuquerque Center prior to entering the MOA/ATCAA and
to activate the track; notify Snakeye prior to entering the MOA/ATCAA and track(s). Tanker
aircraft will clear receivers to enter AR-647/AR-647A.
2.4.3.2. For entry/exit clearance AR-647/AR-647A, receivers will contact Snakeye.
2.4.3.3. Aircraft entering or exiting AR-647/647A must be within the published altitude block
unless Snakeye confirms no other aircraft activity in the SELLS MOA/ATCAA. Aircraft
entering or exiting AR-647 must climb or descend on the border of SELLS or outside the SUA
under ATC guidance to avoid active portions of SELLS.
2.4.3.4. Refueling operations will be conducted on the appropriate Ultrahigh Frequency (UHF)
frequency published in FLIP AP/1B.
2.4.3.5. Flights requesting Military Radar Unit (MRU) assistance must coordinate with
O‘Grady/Autumn GCI (DSN 896-3882/3880) and the scheduled tanker unit.
2.5. Tactical Drop Zones (DZ) and Assault Landing Zones (LZ). Within BMGR East lie
three tactical DZs and two LZs. Coordination/scheduling for each are through 56 RMO/ASMS.
2.5.1. White Hills Circular DZ. (Zone Availability Report (ZAR) 509)
2.5.1.1. Description. Small diameter gravel pit located next to a dirt road.

6 ALZ is on the boundary of the GBAFAF Class D airspace north of military restricted airspace.
The runway is uncontrolled, however, pilots will contact GBAFAF tower throughout AUX-6
flight operations for traffic advisories. Strict adherence to ground track and altitudes depicted at
Figure 2.4 is mandatory. Standard pattern entry will be from the north/northwest to avoid the
Class D airspace and fighter pattern flows.

Figure 2.4. AUX-6 Traffic Patterns.




2.5.5. Stoval Airfield. Un-surveyed assault landing strip located in the northwest corner of R-
2301E south of Dateland, AZ at coordinates N 32 43.75‘ W 113 37.50‘; elevation 361‘. Two
assaults landing strips are featured on the triangular airfield, bearing 080-260, approximately
3600‘ length and 020-200, approximately 3900‘ length.
2.6. Command, Control and Communication.
2.6.1. Real time command and control of BMGR East and SELLS/Gladden/Bagdad SUA.
Snakeye manages access to and movement within BMGR East during scheduled military flight
operations. Snakeye has the authority to grant or deny access to ranges within restricted airspace
and may provide suggestions for holding outside designated sub ranges for deconfliction.
Snakeye will provide proactive monitoring of BMGR East and Gladden/Bagdad SUA and will
provide flight advisory service as necessary for safety of flight.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             27


2.6.1.1. Based on volume of traffic between SELLS MOA and restricted airspace, the following
comm procedures will be followed:
2.6.1.1.1. All aircraft will use Snakeye primary (UHF 264.125) for range access/clearance and
flight advisory service. All aircraft will use/monitor Snakeye primary when within the SELLS
A/B Low MOA transition area from 3,000 AGL-9,500 MSL. Note: Aircraft entering from East
are expected to check in with Snakeye passing intentions—this is a situational awareness radio
call not clearance into a specific restricted range. Flights operating in the LATN area or on an
MTR below the SELLS Low MOA will monitor UHF 379.4. For expenditure reports and
specific mission comm pilots will use Snakeye secondary frequency (UHF 342.0) to minimize
comm on Snakeye primary.
2.6.2. Airspace/Range Access. All flights will contact Snakeye for access into working airspace
before entering and will check out with Snakeye upon exiting BMGR East
Complex/Gladden/Bagdad SUA. Flight lead will provide the following information to Snakeye
when checking in for their respective tactical maneuver area:
2.6.2.1. Call sign, number in flight, range/airspace scheduled, intentions and applicable range
NOTAM identifier (ex. ―Snakeye, Viper 1, 4 ship MARSA Weasel 4 ship for CDE with Bravo‖)
and working frequency if other than standard. Additional information is required for impact
areas (ex. planned targets and weapons to employ against targets). Note: Casual users will add
unit and home/deployed base.
2.6.2.1.1. The type of aircraft, targets to attack, and weapons to employ generate hazard areas
based on weapons footprint that are essential to ground personnel safety.
2.6.2.1.2. Confirm combat LASER use, confirm live ordnance or significant inert weapons (e.g.,
GBU-24/31), confirm MARSA operations, and confirm use of other than established tactical area
frequencies.
2.6.2.1.3. Snakeye will respond FIRST with potential traffic conflicts/pointouts, airspace status,
additional appropriate NOTAMS, then GBAFAF status. Note: For flights checking in on the
east side of the BMGR East Complex Snakeye will acknowledge and provide traffic advisory as
required.
2.6.2.1.4. Airspace/range check out. Pilots will state what airspace they are checking out of and
approximate range/DME from a known reference point (for example BUGGS) for identification.
Snakeye will advise flights of potential traffic conflicts/pointouts, altimeter setting, GBAFAF
active runway (BMGR East only), and any other pertinent information. Pilots will advise
Snakeye of anything that impacted effective mission accomplishment (e.g., weather, capping,
Border Patrol). The 56 RMO must account for all expenditures on BMGR East. All flights will
report weapons expenditures on TAC target(s) on Snakeye secondary frequency with the
following information: call sign, type ordnance and number, and target identifier(s).
2.6.2.2. All users will coordinate with Snakeye when moving to a different area of operations
not previously scheduled (for example, moving from SELLS MOA/ATCAA or STAC to a
manned range or from one Observation Post (OP) to another). GPS tracking of ground personnel
will be verified for situational awareness purposes. All ground personnel will contact Snakeye
for access clearance before entering/exiting BMGR East (required for restricted military land
access only).
 28                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


2.6.3. Snakeye is responsible for the BMGR East daily schedule (to include all Luke AFB
assigned SUA). If it becomes necessary to divert aircraft from one range to another, Snakeye will
be the final approval authority.
2.6.3.1. Although not an air traffic control agency, Snakeye will take a proactive role in
managing access to BMGR East and is responsible for approving and or denying range access to
any flight or ground party. Through the use of an FAA radar feed, Snakeye will provide flight
and situational awareness advisories to military aircraft for safety.
2.6.3.1.1. Mode 2. All military aircraft will squawk IFF mode 2 IAW with Attachment 6.
Casual users will coordinate a Mode 2 squawk with Snakeye during mission planning. Any unit
may coordinate a different squawk with Snakeye for a given tactical scenario.
2.6.3.1.2. Mode 3. Flight lead will squawk Mode 3 at all times, and all wingman will squawk
4000 while in Special use airspace (SUA).
2.6.3.2. Snakeye will use all tools available to enhance and maintain safe air and ground range
operations. Snakeye operators will monitor the BMGR East Complex as well as the Gladden
Bagdad MOA to detect all non-participating (civilian/unscheduled) traffic and will advise
affected flights.
2.6.3.3. If possible, Snakeye will advise aircraft to contact GBAFAF tower when the flight
wishes to perform an airfield orientation, practice approach, or when one of the aircraft in the
flight needs to make an emergency landing. GBAFAF tower can transmit and receive on the
Luke SOF frequency (see Attachment 7) as needed. Snakeye will advise the aircraft of the
status of Range 3 (hot or cold).
2.6.4. Reduced Lighting Conditions ―Lights Out‖ operations at or above 10,000 MSL in SELLS
MOA. Aircraft operating under reduced lighting conditions must be continuously monitored by
Snakeye on a designated operating frequency.               Upon check-in, military pilots will
inform/confirm with Snakeye of lights out operations in the MOA. Snakeye will inform using
flights of non-participating aircraft as they cross the airspace boundary and provide a traffic
advisory anytime a non-participating aircraft is within 5 NM of established military flights.
Upon being given a traffic advisory, flight members should gain the visual and de-conflict from
the non-participating aircraft. If any using flight member is within 3 NM of non-participating
aircraft and not visual (providing their own deconfliction), military pilots will return to normal
lighting for see and avoid purposes. In the event of radar display failure, communications
failure, or any other situation that precludes continuous area monitoring, Snakeye operators will
order a termination of reduced lighting operations until the situation is corrected.
2.6.5. HAVE QUICK/Secure Voice Use. HAVE QUICK, Secure Voice or any non-standard
frequency must be coordinated with Snakeye, and the flight must monitor Very High Frequency
(VHF) GUARD to provide Snakeye a means to contact the flight. During LFEs supported by E-
3A assets, HAVE QUICK operations are authorized provided the E-3A has radio contact with all
airborne players and Snakeye.
2.6.6. BMGR East Overflight.
2.6.6.1. Range Closures without Personnel on Range. During range closures with no personnel
on range (e.g., night missions during EOD/maintenance closures) missions may be scheduled for
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            29


―dry-only‖ operations with no minimum altitude restrictions other than standard operating
procedures
2.6.6.2. Range Closures with Personnel on Range. Under unique circumstances aircraft may be
allowed to operate on the ranges when personnel are present. For example, Pronghorn antelope
monitors and range maintenance—missions may be scheduled for operations above 500‘ AGL.
Exercise extreme caution. Only simulated weapons deliveries, IAW aircraft specific directives,
and eye safe laser operations are authorized during range closures with personnel on range. Self-
protection flares are authorized above 5000‘ AGL; see Para 2.9.2.3. for flare usage at other
times. Pilots will apply MDS and AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, simulated
off-range attack procedures when operating on a closed range.
2.6.6.3. EOD Operations. During EOD demolition operations, missions may be scheduled for
―dry only‖ operations above 7,000‘ AGL. During EOD operations without demolitions,
missions may be scheduled for ―dry only‖ operations above 3,000‘ AGL. Self-protection flares
are not authorized with EOD personnel on range.
2.6.6.4. Transiting near Tactical Impact Areas/Manned Ranges. Transition near, around, or over
an active tactical impact area or manned range is allowed. In all cases, all pilots will contact
Snakeye or specific range/airspace for advisory/clearance and deconfliction. Avoid the manned
ranges below 24,000‘ MSL within 5 NM of the left conventional target on Ranges 1, 2, and 4,
the right conventional on Range 3, or below 7,000‘ MSL within 12.5 miles of the target area to
avoid the pop /system delivery patterns.
2.7. Air Combat Training Systems (ACTS). BMGR East is Air Combat Maneuvering
Instrumentation (ACMI) compatible and the ACMI facility supports real time monitoring and
tethered and untethered ACMI pod debrief capability.
2.7.1. Scheduling. Schedulers will coordinate with ACMI at DSN 896-6509 or (commercial)
856-6509 NLT 24 hours prior for ACMI support. 56 FW priorities for ACMI airspace will be
1) LFEs; 2) D/ACT; 3) ACM; 4) 2v2 TI; 5) BFM; 6) LASDT; 7) 1v1 TI and 8) A/G sorties.
2.7.2. Communications. ACMI will monitor primary frequency of the working area with the
Callsign ―Quickdraw‖. Squadrons may schedule a Range Training Officer (RTO) for any
mission.
2.8. Threat Simulation. BMGR East includes the following threat systems: 4 Fixed-site
AN/TPT-T1(V) Unmanned Threat Emitters (UMTE). In addition, internal to the restricted areas
of the BMGR East complex are 7 unmanned GTR-18A Remote Smokey SAM (RSS) launch
locations. If required, BMGR threat operators have the ability to launch GTR-18A Smokey
SAMs while on site with a mobile threat system. Figure 2.5 identifies the location and type of
each threat system on the BMGR East.

2.8.1. Scheduling. ―Dagger‖ is the call sign for BMGR East Threat Operations. Mission
support will be coordinated with Dagger at DSN 896-9672 or commercial 523-856-9672 NLT
1600L the working day prior to the mission. Missions with short notice coordination may still be
supported depending on Dagger‘s work schedule.
2.8.2. Communications. Contact Dagger on the primary tactical range frequency (Attachment
7).
2.8.3. BMGR East Threat Operations Information and mission support coordination materials
can be found on the RMO Scheduling website at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E.
Specifically, this website provides access to BMGR East threat system descriptions and the
BMGR East Electronic Threat Operations Coordination/Request Form.
2.8.4. AN/TPT-T1(V) (UMTE). The UMTE equipment consists of two major equipment
groups: the Operator Control Group (OCG), and four Remote Emitters. The OCG (located
within ACMI facility at Luke AFB) provides all necessary interfaces, control, and display
functions to operate the remote emitters. The system can be operated in autonomous, semi-
autonomous, or manual modes.
2.8.4.1. Threats are reactive to chaff, maneuver, and ECM however video track can be used to
back up the system manually.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             31


2.8.4.2. The semi-autonomous mode integrates Childs Mountain FAA radar inputs to cue the
remote emitters for subsequent optical track but provides insufficient update rates for viable
track. Operator must manually track aircraft with optical tracker to ensure realistic track. There
is limited night optical track capability.
2.8.4.3. The manual mode requires operator to find and track target aircraft through procedural
and optical only means.
2.8.4.4. Aircraft position data is supplied to UMTE from the best available source to produce
correlated target tracks. Remote emitters are then slaved to the desired target or manually slaved
when no tracks are available. UMTE system is reactive and can be programmed to react to
various forms of threat reactions to include: Chaff, maneuver, terrain, and ECM. Target
detection and engagement characteristics can be altered within the UMTE to provide a varied
response from the simulated hostile integrated air defense system. Each of the three controller
consoles provides direct access to all primary transmitter, pedestal and video control functions.
Operating in a manual mode, an operator (limited to three operators) may view the real-time
threat video and countermeasure events displayed at each OCS, and use a graphical user
interface to effect transmitter mode changes in response to pilot actions.
2.8.4.5. Operators have two-way UHF radio communications for real-time coordination of
scenario changes and limited feedback capability. Unclassified video of threat engagements can
be recorded on VHS for sign out from ACMI facility if requested in advance. In addition, threat
operators will record engagement specifics on an engagement worksheet and fax to squadron
after mission.
2.8.5. GTR-18A (Smokey SAM): The Smokey SAM is a visual cueing system used in
coordination with UMTE and the TRTG or independently. Smokey SAMs resemble large
‗bottle-rockets‘ that are deployed by a 4-bay launcher from remote locations downrange. Once a
target is considered "in-range", a Smokey SAM is launched to simulate an actual surface-to-air
attack. Certain parameters must be followed by the launch operator (wind speed, distance to
target, etc.) to avoid injury to personnel and possible damage to aircraft.
2.8.5.1. Launch Overflight. WARNING: Smokey SAMs have a nominal altitude of 1,500 feet
and should be over flown at least 2,000 feet AGL vertically and 2,000 feet horizontally. Smokey
SAM rocket fragments are foreign object damage (FOD) hazards and must be avoided. Do not
under fly the rocket, as it may take 25 seconds to fall back to earth.
2.9. Countermeasures Employment.
2.9.1. Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) Pod Usage. Electronic jamming is permissible;
however, contact 56 RMO/ASM or 56 RMO/ARO for specific clearance. Depending on the
frequency, jamming is limited to at or below 5,000 AGL or 10,000 AGL.
2.9.2. On-board Aircraft Countermeasures Use. BMGR East supports both chaff and flare self-
protection employment IAW the following guidance:
2.9.2.1. Chaff usage. Training and active chaff is authorized in both burst and rope employment
modes. The following types of chaff are authorized IAW the parameters IAW restrictions in
Table 2.1.

2.9.2.3. Infrared countermeasure flares and Smokey Devils. Employment is authorized on all
ranges according to applicable regulations. Caution will be used to avoid employment over
ground personnel. Based on the USDA Forest Service Fire Danger Forecast, employment is in
accordance with Table 2.2 within R-2301E, R-2304 and R-2305 over military controlled land
only. Restrict employment to 3000‘ AGL in the SELLS MOA and over the CPNWR (southern

2.9.4. Based on actual conditions within BMGR East, the 56 RMO will post current day and
next day‘s forecast BMGR Fire Danger Rating restrictions and any additional flare restrictions
(in some cases more severe than listed in Table 2.4) on the Range NOTAM page with a link to
the latest USDA Forest Service Fire Danger Forecast.:
2.10. Large Scale Target Sensor System (LSTSS). NTAC Target Group 101 is configured
with LSTSS. This target is a no-drop target array designed for simulated attacks with capability
to score combat laser.
2.10.1. Scheduling.
2.10.1.1. Pilots must have NTAC scheduled to receive priority for laser employment on the
LSTSS. NTAC will be scheduled through normal 56 RMO scheduling procedures, and ―Laser‖
should be designated on the scheduling request (Note: all combat laser sorties must be annotated
on the range schedule). Scheduling adjoining airspace in conjunction with NTAC will provide
pilots more options for their attack geometry.
2.10.1.2. ―Dagger‖ is the call sign for LSTSS Operations. Mission support will be coordinated
with Dagger at DSN 896-9672 or commercial 623-856-9672 NLT 1600L the working day prior
to the mission. Dagger may not be available to support same day request due to other
commitments (e.g., support to UMTE requests on STAC or ETAC).
2.10.2. Communications. Contact Dagger on NTAC primary frequency (Attachment 7).
2.10.3. BMGR East LSTSS information and mission support coordination material can be found
on the RMO ACTS website at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/aro. Specifically, this website
provides access to the LSTSS Mission Coordination Procedures, LSTSS Coordination/Request
Form, and LSTSS Target Group 101 Configuration Diagram.
2.11. Tactical Data Link (TDL). 56 RMO manages and operates the TDL program for BMGR
East. The BMGR East TDL network supports Link 16 and Situational Awareness Data Link
(SADL) equipped aircraft.
2.11.1. Scheduling. ―Overlord‖ is the call sign for the BMGR East TDL network manager.
TDL operations are available 24 hours/day, Monday through Friday for routine use. Mission
support (tactical scenario support, virtual track generations, etc.) will be coordinated with
Overlord at DSN 896-8385 (alternate 623-856-8817) or commercial 623-856-8385 (alternate
623-856-8817) NLT 1600L the working day prior to the mission. Missions requesting other than
routine TDL support and those with short notice coordination may still be supported depending
on Overlord‘s work schedule.
2.11.2. Communications. Overlord is UHF capable. Reference Attachment 7 for Overlord‘s
assigned frequency.
2.11.3. BMGR East TDL information and mission support coordination materials can be found
on the RMO ACTS website at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/aro. Specifically, this website access
to the BMGR East Operations Task Link (OPTASKLINK), Overlord Coordination/Request
Form, and the BMGR East TDL Configuration Diagram.
2.12. Weapons Employment. BMGR East supports live and inert air-to-ground and air-to-air
weapons employment. Specific information on ordnance approved for use on BMGR East in
general and on specific targets is provided in Attachment 8.
 34                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


2.12.1. Inertially Aided Munitions (IAMs) Employment. In addition to IAMs procedures
published in AFI 11-214, paragraph 2.12.1.1. and 2.12.1.2 must be applied when employing
IAMs on the BMGR.
2.12.1.1. Targeting Pods (TGPs). TGPs can be used on the BMGR to generate or refine
coordinates but must meet the following requirements: (1) Must start with a known target
centroid; (2) Must be able to generate CAT II TLE coordinates or better; (3) If using LANTIRN
or TGPs that cannot generate CAT II TLE coordinates or better, only targets indicated in
Attachment 8 with the symbol ―|||||||||||||||‖ can be used.
2.12.1.2. Triple Check Verification (TCV). IAW AFI 11-214 and WDZ program requirements,
for IAMs employment, target coordinate verification will be accomplished via three independent
checks that must include at least one other person in the process. (1) Cross check coordinates to
published range guidance; (2) Accomplish a coordinate read back to another individual; and (3)
Require positive visual identification that the target coordinates are within the anticipated target
area.
2.12.2. Armed Hot Conditions. All aircraft are allowed to be in an ―armed hot‖ condition when
in restricted airspace and over land managed by USAF (See Figure 1.2 - BMGR East).
Operating in an ―armed hot‖ condition over non-military lands, including the CPNWR and the
Tohono O‘odham Nation (see Figure 2.6) is not permitted.

Figure 2.6. Non-Military Lands Underlying BMGR East Complex Airspace.




2.12.3. Weapons Release. The following conditions are required for any weapons release: 1)
within restricted airspace; 2) over military controlled land; 3) the hazard area (weapons footprint)
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                              35


is contained within military controlled land; 4) the desired point of impact is directed against an
authorized target.
2.12.4. Users will report expenditures to Snakeye IAW para 2.6.2.1.4.
2.13. Laser Operations. 56 RMO/ARO is the laser safety office for BMGR East. On Class A
ranges, the RCO is the Laser Safety Officer (LSO); on Class B/C (tactical) ranges, the
pilot/Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) is the designated LSO.
2.13.1. The BMGR East target areas are certified and approved for laser operations. Reference
Attachment 9 for specific laser systems authorized for use on the BMGR East complex and
target lasing restrictions.
2.13.2. Use of combat (non eye-safe) laser is not authorized ON ANY RANGE unless
coordinated in advance with Range Scheduling, reflected on the BMGR East range schedule, and
confirmed on check-in with Snakeye. Ground parties will contact 56 RMO/ARO laser safety
officers for guidance prior to employment. Laser operations include the use of Air
Commander‘s Pointer (ACP); however, ACPs do not have to be annotated on the schedule.
Combat Laser use is not authorized when over flying or in the vicinity of ground personnel
without their knowledge and use of laser eye protection.
2.13.3. Laser operators will follow AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations; paragraphs
4.10 and 4.10.7 in addition to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures guidance on
laser operations.
2.13.4. All laser operators will meet the following criteria:
2.13.4.1. All ground laser operators will be briefed on laser operations on BMGR East prior to
employment by the 56 RMO LSO or designated representative.
2.13.4.2. Have received training in the proper and safe use of laser systems being employed.
2.13.4.3. Have positive communication with the RCO, LSO, or Snakeye as appropriate during
laser operations. Notify the RCO or Snakeye when terminating laser activities on range.
2.13.4.4. Essential personnel in the laser safety danger zone (LSDZ) shall wear appropriate LEP
corresponding to the wavelength and optical density listed in Attachment 9.
2.13.4.5. The laser operator shall warn all personnel on the range of imminent laser operations.
Ensure all personnel in the vicinity of operations remain outside the laser target area and LSDZ
or wear appropriate LEP corresponding to the wavelength and optical density listed in
Attachment 9.
2.13.4.6. Inform aircraft in adjoining airspace when using lasers.
2.13.5. All combat laser operations will commence and end within the confines of restricted
ground and airspace for the BMGR East.
2.13.7. Pilots and or TACPs may activate lasers only after positive identification of the target
and after ensuring the laser target area and LSDZ are clear of unauthorized personnel. The laser
may only be energized when pointing at the laser target area (scanning targets while lasing is not
authorized).
 36                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


2.13.8. No Class 3b or 4 lasers shall be fired above the horizon or backstop (e.g., hills, trees, or
large targets). In unique cases where above horizon laser operations are required, contact the
56 RMO (prior coordination with DoD Laser Clearinghouse and the FAA is required).
2.13.9. On Class A ranges, no lasing of targets if standing water is observed within 3,000‘ of the
target. On Class B/C ranges, the on-site LSO (pilot/TACP) should consider the effects of
standing water. Water can become a flat specular reflector when it is calm (for example, a
mirror like surface), the reflection hazard to personnel in other aircraft increases and additional
precautions are required. Only one aircraft should be allowed on range at a time when the
decision is made to use a target with standing water present.
2.13.10. LASER Termination. Aircrew will immediately terminate laser operations if
unauthorized personnel are observed in the LSDZ, equipment malfunction is observed, target is
lost in field of view, or anytime laser safety cannot be assured.
2.13.11. Range Contractor Preparation. The contractors will take reasonable measures to
ensure: nonessential, unprotected personnel are excluded from ranges where lasers are in use;
windows, mirrors, chrome, and other reflective surfaces have been removed from the targets, and
targets are painted with non-reflective paint.
2.13.12. LASER Hazards.
2.13.12.1. Buildings, towers, and UMTEs located on range are not targets. Laser use at these
facilities is not authorized.
2.13.2.2. A potential laser hazard exists at the BMGR EOD burn area (N3245.10 W11253.03).
A highly reflective metallic rectangular security fence has been installed around the EOD burn
area. Aircrews using lasers and other IR/Optical devices should exercise caution when operating
in this area.
2.14. Tactical Air Control Party (TACP). TACPs regularly train on BMGR East from
designated locations on the tactical ranges. When TACP deployment is approved, Range
Scheduling will annotate the BMGR Range NOTAMs with TACP call sign and location.
Snakeye will advise all flights of TACP call sign and working frequency. All flights will contact
the TACP IAW AFI 11-214 even when not planning to utilize them. For safety of TACPs, unit
schedulers must ensure all HE deliveries and laser missions are posted on the BMGR schedule.
Refer to Chapter 4 for expanded information concerning TACPs.
2.15. Bird Watch Procedures. The RCO and GBAFAF Tower will issue bird hazard warnings
and ensure both Snakeye and the command post is notified. The RCO/ Snakeye will advise
flights if the Bird Watch Condition (BWC) is other than LOW according to the following
criteria:
2.15.1. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE. Bird activity on or immediately above the active
runway or other specific location representing high potential for strikes. The respective range
will be closed.
2.15.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE. Bird activity near the active runway or other
specific location representing increased potential for strikes. BWC moderate requires increased
vigilance by all agencies and supervisors, and caution by aircrews. For 56 FW, only required
syllabus events or Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) required events may be flown.
2.16.3. Bird Watch Condition LOW. No restrictions.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             37


2.16. Contingencies within BMGR East. GBAFAF tower continuously monitors the Luke
AFB Supervisor of Flying (SOF) frequency.
2.17.1. Penetrating Other Range‘s Airspace. If your flight path will penetrate another range‘s
airspace, make a call on Guard (for example, "This is Tiger 2, F-16, IFE, departing AIR-TO-AIR
High, direct Gila Bend at 8,000").
2.17.2. Emergency with No-Radio (NORDO) Communications. Squawk emergency, 7700;
(NORDO without an emergency should squawk 7600) use airborne radar to clear your flight
path. Snakeye should advise affected airspace and advise GBAFAF tower of inbound
emergency aircraft.
2.17.3. Runaway Gun. Various ranges are located in close proximity to each other as well as
manned sites. Flight briefing should emphasize procedures for your specific range. In the event
of a runaway gun following a firing pass; recover the aircraft, employ appropriate aircraft
procedures, and fly straight ahead until the gun ceases to fire. On Ranges 1 and 3, personnel
may be 5 NM west of the strafe targets—a turn out of traffic is necessary, safety permitting.
2.17.4. Hung Ordnance. GBAFAF is available for recovery of aircraft with live/inert ordnance
that will not jettison. When diverting to GBAFAF with hung live ordnance pilots will advise
GBAFAF tower and declare an emergency. Follow control tower instructions for parking
(expect to remain in end of runway turn around areas).
2.17.5. Jettison. Aircrews are allowed to jettison external tanks, inert ordnance, and
launchers/dispensers on any open manned range (Nuclear Weapons Delivery (NWD) target) or
tactical range. Pilots will coordinate with Snakeye and RCO, if applicable, for jettison. If
required, call on Guard to coordinate. For manned range jettison, obtain clearance from the
RCO, fly toward the NWD target at or above 1,000‘ AGL IAW respective attack headings, and
jettison stores when over the target. If jettison is unsuccessful, avoid flying over buildings or
highways while repositioning. For tactical ranges, jettison on any inert authorized target (not HE
hill or the live Maverick target).
2.17.5.1. Jettison HE ordnance on one of the HE Hills no lower than 1000‘ AGL above the frag.
2.17.5.2. Alternate jettison procedure (tactical range not available or IMC/above the weather).
Pilots will contact Snakeye, ETAC, and Range 3 to coordinate using the alternate jettison
procedure. The alternate jettison area is defined off the Gila Bend VORTAC (ch 113) 150 radial,
12 nautical miles outbound between 1,000‘ AGL and 17,000‘ MSL. This jettison point places
the aircraft in the northwest corner of ETAC with the intended weapons point of impact within
the range boundaries.
2.17.6. Inadvertent/Unintentional Release. Pilots will report all inadvertent/unintentional
releases to the RCO and Snakeye with; call sign, type of aircraft, time and description of
incident, and impact point, if known, as soon as possible. Snakeye will relay to the Luke AFB
command post, who will notify the appropriate unit‘s command post (if necessary) of the
inadvertent release.
2.17.7. Off-Range Impact. Pilots must be thoroughly aware of the range boundaries and ensure
mission materials are sufficient for in-flight assessment of off-range impacts. All impacts
(known or suspected) outside designated impact areas (greater than 1000 meters from intended
target) will be reported. Pilots will immediately notify Snakeye of all off-range impacts with;
 38                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


call sign, type of aircraft, time and description of incident, and impact point, if known. ROCC
personnel will immediately notify 56 RMO/ASM/ARO, EOD, and the Luke AFB command post
of all known or suspected off-range impacts.
2.17.8. EOD Coordination. Notify range operations upon departure from the range of any
unusual EOD requirements. Specifically, inform them whenever live ordnance is jettisoned or
delivered anywhere on other than an authorized target, and/or does not function properly.
2.17.9. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procedures. Occasionally, CBP requires
immediate ground access to BMGR East. When this occurs, the CBP will contact GBAFAF
security forces and/or Snakeye. Snakeye will then notify the affected ranges and aircraft,
restricting all operations to dry and 500‘ AGL minimum or as directed.
2.17.9.1. If CBP is working within NTAC/STAC, manned ranges can conduct normal operations
with the following restriction: No strafe on manned Ranges 1 or 2 depending on the location of
the CBP ground party and possibly manned range 4 if the CBP operation moves north.
2.17.9.2. If a helicopter is being utilized in the CBP pursuit, the code words ―BORSTAR Ops‖
will be used and all aircraft will be restricted to 1,000‘ AGL and above or as directed.
2.17.9.3. CBP will advise Snakeye when their mission no longer impacts the BMGR.
2.17.9.4. Given the BMGR complex shares a border with Mexico, CBP fixed wing operations
are frequent within the SELLS MOA, extending all VFR altitudes. Military pilots are reminded
the MOA is VFR ―see and avoid,‖ to remain vigilant for other aircraft, and respect CBP‘s need
to operate in the area.
2.17.9.4.1. Most CBP flights are unscheduled and unannounced. Traffic advisories should be
issued by Snakeye with respect to unscheduled or CBP aircraft operating or transiting airspace.
Military flights may be directed to come up Snakeye frequency to receive information or work
pilot-to-pilot deconfliction with CBP pilots. Military pilots are not to intercept or harass any
unscheduled aircraft (e.g. using self protection flares to highlight being in the MOA).
2.17.9.4.2. At times the 56 RMO coordinates pre-planned CBP fixed wing operations. These
operations involve a variety of aircraft at varying altitudes in different parts of BMGR East.
Every effort will be made to maximize airspace use for both military and CBP while not
adversely effecting respective missions. In these instances, scheduled flights will be made aware
of the operation (call sign, track, altitude, and frequency) in order to aid mission planning and
deconfliction. Snakeye will assist both CBP and military missions, providing traffic advisories
as necessary.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            39


                                           Chapter 3

                                     MANNED RANGES

3.1. General. BMGR East contains four separate manned ranges. Each range has two
conventional targets/circles, a NWD target/circle, one tactical target, four strafe pits, and one
tactical strafe target. Ranges 1, 2, and 4 have the same layout (NWD target south of the
conventional targets) while Range 3 is configured with the NWD target to the north. Figure 3.1
illustrates the range locations within BMGR East and respective layouts. Based on the unique
nature of each range and it‘s proximity to other maneuver areas, each range is further defined in
this chapter. For purposes of discussion and deconfliction, fast movers are defined as F-15E, F-
16, or F-18 aircraft or any jet that typically flies pattern speeds in excess of 400 KTGS.

Figure 3.1. Manned Range Locations within BMGR East.




3.2. Airspace Defined. Airspace for the manned ranges extends from the surface up to and
including 24,000‘ MSL within a 5 NM circle centered on the left conventional target (Ranges 1,
2, 4) and the right conventional target on Range 3. Due to Range 3‘s close proximity to ETAC,
when ETAC traffic is other than joint-use helicopters, the circle does not extend past the Range
3/ETAC boundary road. Range 4 does not have a complete 5 NM circle due to close proximity
to the R2301E border and is restricted to the north. Specific lateral limits of manned ranges are
difficult to define due to the wide variety of patterns and deliveries authorized. Assume a hot
manned range extends 12.5 NM east of the main tower up to 6,500‘ MSL to accommodate NWD
patterns. When the pop pattern is active, flights may operate as far as 8 NM southeast or
northeast of the conventional targets. (Figure 3.2)
 40                                          AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


Figure 3.2. Typical Manned Range Pattern Layouts.




3.2.1. Ranges 1 and 2. Ranges 1 and 2 lie within R-2301E; however, the pop patterns extend
into R-2305, and the NWD patterns extend into R-2305 and R-2304. The NTAC/STAC complex
is 5 NM west of the main towers. The AAHI airspace, overlying Ranges 1, 2, and 4 west of
Arizona SR 85 begins at 25,000‘.
3.2.2. Range 3. Range 3 lies within R-2305; however, fast mover NWD and pop patterns extend
into the ETAC portion of R-2304, requiring scheduling ETAC for these types of deliveries.
3.2.3. Range 4. Range 4 and its patterns lie entirely within R-2301E. The northern border of
R-2301E is only 1.25 NM north of the right conventional target; NTAC airspace begins 5 NM
south of the main tower, and Range 2 is 12 NM southeast of the main tower. The AAHI
airspace, overlying Ranges 1, 2, and 4 west of Arizona SR 85 begins at 25,000‘.
3.3. Classes of Ranges. All manned ranges are scheduled as Class A with a RCO unless
otherwise specified in the range request. Range scoring is accomplished remotely. Class B/C
use is not desired (no RCO) however can be authorized, but must be specifically scheduled as
such. Overflight of manned range airspace may also be scheduled, and should be annotated as
such.
3.4. Communications. The manned ranges are equipped with a multi-channel UHF radio set to
Snakeye, a fixed-channel UHF set to the specific range operating frequency, with a simulcast
capability on UHF GUARD, a multi-channel VHF radio, and a ground radio for communications
with Snakeye and other range agencies. See Attachment 7 for specific manned range frequency
assignments.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                                 41


3.4.1. Flight leads will provide the following information before performing any events on the
range: call sign, type events (to include planned delivery dive angle), events using Turning
Maneuver Level Turn (TMLT) recoveries and any combat LASER events. These items can be
pre-briefed via telephone.
3.4.2. Clearance on range will include target and pattern direction (for example, ―…cleared on
Range 2, right range (target), left traffic, alternating strafe.‖). If no contact is made with the
RCO, contact Snakeye for assistance/instructions. Exit after accomplishing an armament safety
check.
3.4.3. For all operations, IAW AFI 13-212, ―The RCO must maintain continuous radio
communication with all aircraft on the range, and will clear each aircraft before every hot or dry
pass and each LASER designation. The RCO must clear all ordnance deliveries before release.‖
All RCO transmissions (except ―Cleared Hot/Dry‖) will be acknowledged. If the range working
frequency is unusable, BMGR East common backup is available. Depending on the specific
manned range, VHF capability also exists as a means of communication. Manned range
frequencies are found in Attachment 7.
3.4.4. ―Flight Lead Control‖ (e.g., dry Maverick or high altitude release bombs where visual is
difficult) is authorized at RCO discretion. Under flight lead control during HADB/HARB
events, aircraft releasing actual or simulated ordnance will call ―in‖ or ―in, dry‖, and ―off dry‖, as
appropriate. No clearance to expend will be transmitted by the RCO or flight lead. The intent is
to issue an advisory radio call to the RCO/flight members that an aircraft is committed to a
weapons release pass. RCO‘s will continue to spot actual ordnance releases to validate weapons
expenditure and impact location.
3.5. Manned Ranges Entry/Exit/Holding Procedures.
3.5.1. Manned Ranges 1/2/3 Entry Procedures: Range entry is VFR through specific flow points
(Cim Peak, NOLLS, MTR). Contact Snakeye IAW Chapter 2 and the specific manned range
RCO for range clearance. Figure 3.3 illustrates entry points and designated holding for manned
ranges. Primary entry will be through Cim Peak. Proceed no further than the range holding point
until cleared on range by the RCO/using flight. Remain below 10K MSL until within 5 NM of
range to deconflict with Ajo Transition traffic unless verified clear by Snakeye.
3.5.2. Low level/ MTR/ LATN Entry. Typical entry is east-to-west. Remain below 5,000‘ to
deconflict from eastbound departing traffic at or above 5,500‘. (Note: 79 RQS C-130‘s are
authorized to conduct LATN entries and exits.)
3.5.3. NOLLS/West Entry. (Caution: Radio advisories and flight deconfliction is paramount.)
West entry may be accomplished by transiting NTAC or STAC.
3.5.4. Holding: Preferred manned range holding is over the scheduled range. If required to hold
outside the range, hold as depicted in Figure 3.3. (Caution: Other aircraft may be holding in
the same area for different ranges.)
3.5.5. Manned Ranges 1/2/3 exit procedures: Range exit is either reverse routing though Cim
Peak or north towards COOLY (Range 3 may exit VFR east of GBAFAF. Fly northeast avoiding
ETAC and GBAFAF Class D airspace unless cleared by GBAFAF tower.) All flights exiting
will confirm status of adjacent ranges and coordinate deconfliction. Remain outside 5 NM
of a range below 10K MSL if clearance is not granted for overflight. Use caution for holding
 42                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


traffic between Coffee Pot—Cim Peak and inbound traffic. East departures should remain north
of Ajo on a southeasterly heading at 5,500‘ through 9,500‘. Avoid overflight of Ajo Airport and
the town of Ajo below 4000‘. Use caution for aircraft entering/holding in the vicinity of
Cimarron Peak holding area. Monitor Range Operations until clear of R-2304/5.

Figure 3.3. Manned Ranges Entry/Exit/Holding Procedures.




3.5.6. Range 4 entry/exit procedures: See 3.18 this section.
3.6. Weather Requirements. IAW aircraft specific directives. RCOs will close the ranges
when the ceiling is less than 1,500‘ for day operations, 3,000‘ for night operations, and/or
visibility is less than 3 NM for day and 5 NM for night operations. Pilots will discontinue events
and advise the RCO whenever weather prevents positive range or target identification throughout
the pattern. RCOs will advise Snakeye when surface winds exceed 35 kts. Snakeye will also
advise the command posts at Luke AFB, Davis-Monthan AFB, and Tucson IAP when surface
winds on BMGR East exceed 35 kts. Range winds are available from Snakeye on request.
When sustained winds exceed 25 kts (including gusts), strafe targets will be lowered.
3.7. Target Specifics. Targets consist of salvaged vehicles. Target, reference point and radar
reflector coordinates for respective ranges are located at Attachment 10. Reference Figure 3.3
and Figure 3.4 for manned range layout illustrations.

Figure 3.4. Typical Manned Range Layout.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             43




3.7.1. Target classification. All targets are considered ―Hard‖ except for strafe panels and the
tactical strafe vehicle.
3.7.2. Conventional Target. There are two conventional targets, one on each side of the range,
inside a 300‘ radius graded circle for bomb, rocket (TP), and High Angle Strafe (HAS) events.
The conventional targets are referred to as right and left (the right conventional is always the
northern target).
3.7.3. Tactical Target. The tactical target is located approximately 1000‘ outside the
conventional target (opposite the NWD target) for bomb, rocket (TP), and HAS events. The
tactical target is not identified by a graded circle.
3.7.4. NWD Target. The NWD target is inside concentric circles, at the end of a 7 NM
(approximate) run-in line, with four reference points situated at approximately 10,000‘ intervals.
Bomb, rocket (TP/WP), and HAS events are authorized on the NWD target.
3.7.4.1. Radar Reflectors/Visual Update Markers. Each range has radar reflectors at various
locations for Offset Aimpoints (OAPs). Visual update markers are located at 10,000‘, 20,000‘,
30,000‘, and an entry marker consisting of white barrels welded together to form the roman
numeral for that range is located near the beginning of the run-in line (40/45,000‘ IP).
3.7.5. Strafe Panels. There are four strafe panels, two on each side of the tower, identified
(numbered) as left 1/2 and right 1/2 (1 and 2 from inside to outside of tower centerline). The
aiming reference is a drag chute centered approximately 11‘ AGL. A road/line of white tires
identifies the 2000‘ Low Angle Strafe (LAS) foul line. Long range strafe, two-target strafe, and
LAS are allowed on any of the strafe panels. Additionally, left panel 2 is configured for HAS.
 44                                                AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


3.7.6. Tactical Strafe. Each range has a tactical strafe target located outside of right panel 2,
3500‘ beyond the LAS foul line. The foul line also applies to strafing on this ―soft‖ target.
3.7.7. Scoring. All targets are electronically scored (remotely). Bomb impacts are recorded
using a Weapons Impact Scoring System, devised of camera and computer based scoring.
Bullets on the conventional and applied tactical targets are scored like bombs (mean point of
impact). For strafe panel scoring, an Improved Remote Strafe Scoring System (acoustic scoring
system) is used utilizing electronic/computer to score bullet impacts.
3.8. Authorized Ordnance. Expenditures on manned ranges are limited to the training
ordnance listed in Attachment 8 with some requiring special permission from 56 RMO/ARO.
Exceptions to listed ordnance require approval by the 56 RMO/Director.
3.9. Ordnance Procedures. System checks and delivery procedures will be IAW AFI 11-214,
Air Operations Rules and Procedures, MAJCOM MDS-series guidance and this supplement.
3.10. Manned Range Pattern Considerations.
3.10.1. Normal Procedures. During the day, a maximum of four aircraft are authorized in the
pattern. The first weapons delivery pattern or pass on the range for any event may be hot (first
run attack). Minimums are according to applicable directives for each aircraft system and/or
each flying unit involved.
3.10.2. Patterns. All ranges allow for box/curve, pop and NWD patterns. Standard patterns are
from east-to-west using right range, left traffic. West-to-east patterns may be flown using a box
pattern only. When requesting the west-to-east attack heading option, the conventional targets
will still be referred to as right and left (the right conventional is always the northern target). See
Figure 3.2 for specific range pattern layouts. The following address unique pattern specifics
related to manned ranges.
3.10.2.1. Box Pattern. Standard Box Pattern for the conventional, tactical and NUC targets are
east to west, right range, left traffic or left range, right traffic keeping the range towers inside the
turns. Exception: Range 3/4 fast mover (e.g., F-16/18) patterns must remain south of the range
complex due to airspace constraints. The standard pattern may be used for BDU employment
and must be used for Strafe and Rocket employment (no gun or rocket employment from west to
east).
3.10.2.1.1. When fast mover HARBs are being flown on Range 1 or 2, the adjacent range must
use the same DIRECTION OF TURN if HARBs are being employed on the adjacent range.
3.10.2.2. Non Standard Box Patterns. For BDU employment the following pattern options may
be used:
3.10.2.2.1. Opposite direction (west to east). BDU only, normal patterns; right range–right
traffic or left range–left traffic may be accomplished.
3.10.2.2.2. Left range – left pattern or right range – right pattern.            These target/pattern
combinations can be used daytime only; flank tower must be unmanned.
3.10.2.3. Pop Patterns. When fast movers are performing pops on Ranges 1, 2, and/or 3, the
adjacent range to the north must use the same direction of turn. To illustrate, if F-16s on Range
1 use ―left range, right traffic,‖ it affects the direction of turn on Ranges 2 and 3. This ―domino‖
effect can hinder mission effectiveness on the two other ranges; therefore, unless absolutely
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               45


necessary, right turn pop patterns will not be used unless the flight coordinates with other ranges‘
missions, or target non-availability occurs without prior notice. On Range 4, all fast mover pop
patterns will be left turn patterns to remain within the airspace boundary.
3.10.2.4. Pilots will keep the towers on the inside of the turn for pop patterns. Exception: A-10
LAS, may fly the base leg for box or pop LAS inside the flank tower provided the gun is not
pointed directly at either tower at any time.
3.10.2.5. Early Turns. Early turn to crosswind (between the towers) is approved with the
aircraft nose above the horizon, for rockets and dry passes only. Keep the crosswind turn as far
from the main tower as possible.
3.10.3. NWD Pattern Specifics.
3.10.3.1. NWD Pattern. All NWD patterns will be left traffic with downwind altitude 5,500‘.
All flights in the NWD pattern will remain within 12.0 NM of the target due to competing
airspace boundaries. Normal NWD final is 7-10 NM.
3.10.3.2. Range 1/2. Due to the proximity of NWD patterns, flights must exercise caution for
conflicts between Range 1 final and Range 2 base positions (16NM east of NWD target).
3.10.3.3. Communications. Report over the 40/45 IP with "call sign (CS), final, event". When
final run-ins are extended beyond 7 NM, make the ―base‖ and "final" calls with an exact range
from the target. After the final call, the RCO will reply "cleared hot," "continue," or "abort." Do
not expend ordnance unless cleared hot. Call "off wet/dry," as appropriate, when off target.
3.10.3.4. Abort Procedures. If the RCO calls for the pass to be aborted, clear the run-in line
away from the towers so as to fly outside the 2,000‘ NWD circle. After passing the circle, start a
normal turn to downwind.
3.11. Manned Range Delivery Considerations.
3.11.1. Opposite direction attacks. Allowed on the conventional targets and NWD. Limited to
box patterns, diving deliveries, BDU employment only.
3.11.1.1. The NWD target may be used for a first-run west-to-east system level delivery (SLD)
attack on Ranges 1, 3, and 4.
3.11.1.2. West-to-east loft/toss or stand-off deliveries are not allowed on any range.
3.11.2. The first turn after a loft/toss delivery will be away from the range towers.
3.11.3. F-16 HAS considerations. F-16s can utilize the tactical strafe target (soft) and the left
panel 2 (soft) for HAS with recoveries IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
All other targets are considered hard for mission planning considerations.
3.11.4. A-10 Long Range Strafe (LRS) and Two-Target Strafe (TTS). The maximum open-fire
range for LRS and TTS is 9,000‘ slant range. Aircraft firing prior to passing abeam the flank
tower (10,000‘ slant range) will be assessed a foul.
3.11.5. Loft Rockets are approved on the NUC target from east to west on Ranges 1, 3 and 4.
Loft Rockets are not authorized on Range 2 due to the requirement to deploy the weapon from
the east side of Arizona SR 85.
 46                                                AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


3.11.6. Element Attacks (two aircraft attacking the same target with approximately 5-10 second
spacing) are allowed (daytime only) and provided pattern similar (i.e., both either pop or box
patterns). RCO shall advise scoring accuracy may be affected if impacts are nearly
simultaneous.
3.11.7. Split Attacks are same as element attacks however; using two different targets (right/left
conventional) are not authorized.
3.11.8. Attacking two different targets that are adjacent (i.e., right conventional/tactical target) is
approved (daytime only) when mission is employing standard spacing and using the same type of
attack pattern.
3.12. Night Weapons Delivery. All manned ranges are night capable, with target lead-in
lighting available on the right conventional target(s) only. Night range operations begin at
official sunset. Patterns ground tracks are same as day.
3.12.1. Normal Procedures. Maximum aircraft will be IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
and Procedures. Minimum altitudes are according to aircraft specific regulations. Night
weapons delivery may be conducted on either illuminated targets or unlit targets. RCOs are
equipped with night vision devices (NVDs) to enhance operations.
3.12.2. Manned Range Tower Illumination. The main tower is illuminated with two flashing
lights and the flank is illuminated with a steady red light. On the main tower, one light is red
incandescent and the other is infrared. Both are controllable (ON/OFF) and the RCO can select
one light or the other or both depending on pilot preference. The default setting is both lights on.
3.12.3. Target Illumination. For visual deliveries pilots must positively identify the target using
NVDs, illumination flares, or target lights (T-lights). T-lights are only found on the right
conventional target of each range and have variable intensities. T-light settings range from 0
(off) to 5 (highest intensity), with 4 the default. Based on conditions, pilots may request to have
light intensity varied or the lights turned off. Ranges 3 and 4 T-lights are more suitable for basic
student training; target light patterns are illustrated at Figure 3.5. Without NVDs or illumination
flares to provide positive target identification, the minimum target illumination is at least two of
the four ground markers at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o‘clock to the target.

Figure 3.5. Manned Range Night Lighting Schemes.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            47




3.12.4. Communications. Additional required radio calls in the night conventional pattern are:
"CS, off wet/dry" when off target, and ―CS, downwind‖ when abeam the target on downwind.
Radio contact between the RCO, fighters, and flaring aircraft is mandatory throughout all night
range operations.
3.12.5. Aircraft Lighting. Fighter aircraft will select lights according to individual aircraft
lighting instructions. Aircraft are allowed to operate under reduced lighting conditions but only
to the extent where RCOs can still visually track each aircraft safely. The preferred lighting is
navigation lights set to normal/overt.
3.12.6. Special Procedures and Precautions:
3.12.6.1. Manned Towers. Extreme caution must be exercised to prevent pointing at or
overflying the manned towers. A flashing red beacon and infrared light identify the main tower
and a steady red light identifies the flank tower. During NVD flight operations, pilots may
request to have the red flashing beacon turned off to minimize light interference.
3.12.6.2. Illumination Flare Accountability. The flare-ship will call the number of illumination
flares expended per pass. In some instances the RCO will help in identifying dud flares. Abort
all passes when ignited, burned out, or dud flares present a hazard.
3.12.6.3. Night time LRS is authorized on the Tactical Strafe Target for A-10‘s with the
following guidelines: High Illumination conditions as determined by the pilot, minimum altitude
1,000‘ AGL. RCO will score the event visually (Hit or Miss) if able.
3.13. LANTIRN (Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night) Procedures.
3.13.1. Normal Procedures. LANTIRN patterns may be flown on all manned ranges. Attacks
may be flown on any scored bomb target. Flight leads must notify the RCO before flying
Terrain Following Radar (TFR) patterns.
    48                                           AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


3.13.2. Pattern. Patterns will be left-hand racetrack patterns. Downwind altitude will normally
be 5500‘ but can be flown lower if under Terrain Following (TF) protection and authorized for
that range. If under TF protection, the downwind leg of the LANTIRN pattern will be wider
than the NWD pattern, and special care must be taken to avoid conflicts with other range
patterns. Low altitude TFR instructions/regulations apply, with the following restrictions:
3.13.2.1. Range 1. No low altitude TFR downwind because of proximity to Ajo and Ajo airport.
3.13.2.2. Range 2. No low altitude TFR downwind if Range 1 NWD pattern is hot.
3.13.2.3. Range 3. No low altitude TFR downwind if Range 2 right traffic NWD or pop pattern
is hot. All crosswind turns will remain east of Arizona SR 85.
3.13.2.4. Range 4. No low altitude TFR downwind when Range 2 is doing TMLT recoveries.
All base turns will remain west of Arizona SR 85.
3.14. Manned Range Laser Procedures. Attachment 9 identifies lasers certified for use on
manned ranges. All targets are approved for Combat LASER operations.
3.14.1. Pilots will advise the RCO before any laser operation in order to secure the range for
laser operations and don LEP.
3.14.2. Minimum Altitudes. Reference Table 3.1 for flight profile limitations. Lasing will not
be performed below 2000 feet AGL while crossing public highways or other active roads.

Note: Line of Sight must be verified for each target prior to lasing.
3.14.3. Heading Restrictions. Attacks are limited east-west only using published headings per
manned range.
3.14.4. NWD Target and/or Delayed Lasing. Practice lasing on the NWD target is authorized
once established on published downwind parameters. Delayed lasing for loft deliveries is
authorized when the designator turn/recovery is away from the range towers.
3.14.5. Pops. Lasing during pop deliveries is authorized only after roll-in.
3.15. Air Commander’s Pointer (ACP) Procedures.

3.16.4. Emergency Airfield. GBAFAF; heading 014/ 24 NM.
3.16.5. Range 1 Pattern Information, Conflicts, and Hazards.
3.16.5.1. Ajo Highway. Several patterns cross the Ajo-Gila Bend highway and railroad. Special
care must be taken when over flying the highway.
3.16.5.2. Range 1 Pop Pattern. Avoid over flying the Ajo Airport and the Childs Ranch south of
Batamote Mountain below 4,000‘. Do not extend the right traffic pop pattern north of AUX 8
(5.7 NM Northeast of Range 1 right conventional target) to avoid conflicts with Range 2 traffic.
Range 1 and Range 2 fast movers must use the same direction of traffic for pops and HARBs.
The POP Pattern extends outside the restricted area R-2305 to the south. Release systems will be
safed prior to exiting restricted airspace (downwind) and will not be re-armed until inside R-
2305 (approximately 6 NM from the right conventional target).
3.16.5.3. Range 1 NWD Pattern. Left traffic. Downwind altitude 5,500 MSL. Remain within
12NM. The NWD downwind is outside the R-2305 boundary. Release systems will be safed
immediately when rolling out on downwind and will not be re-armed until on final and in
restricted airspace. Avoid the Ajo airport and Childs Ranch below 4,000‘.
3.16.5.4. Range 1 LANTIRN Pattern. Same as NWD above. Low altitude TFR downwind not
permitted due to Ajo and its airport.
3.16.5.5. Range 1 Range Munitions Consolidation Point, ―Water Well‖. The Range Munitions
Consolidation Point (RMCP) for Range 1/NTAC/STAC is located 7.5 NM due west of the right
conventional target and 1 NM east of the STAC border, identified by a cleared area located at
N32 32.170‘ W113 05.030‘, coincident with a water storage tank. Avoid overflight of the
RMCP when occupied. Aircraft experiencing a runaway gun should attempt a right turn out of
traffic ASAP, due to the possibility of personnel at the water well.

3.17.5.1. Ajo Highway. Several patterns cross the Ajo-Gila Bend highway and railroad. Special
care must be taken to avoid weapons releases in this area.
3.17.5.2. TMLT Recoveries. When TMLT recoveries are conducted on the right range, the
RCO will contact the Range 4 RCO. Low altitude TFR downwinds on Range 4 will be
suspended. Early climbs after TMLT‘s may conflict with Range 4 NWD patterns. TMLTs may
be restricted until coordination is complete.
3.17.5.3. Range 2 HARB/POP Pattern. When fast mover HARBs or pops are being flown on
Range 1 or 2, the adjacent range must use the same DIRECTION OF TURN if fast movers
intend to perform HARBs on that range. This restriction only applies to Ranges 1 and 2.
3.17.5.4. Range 2 NWD Pattern. Left traffic. Downwind altitude 5,500 MSL. Remain within
12NM.
3.17.5.5. Range 2 LANTIRN Pattern. Low altitude TFR downwind not permitted when Range 1
NWD pattern is hot.
3.17.5.6. Range 3 Traffic. Traffic between Cimarron Peak and Range 3 may transit SW of
ETAC, within 2 NM of the NWD final on Range 2.
3.17.5.7. Range 2 Range Munitions Consolidation Point (RMCP). The RMCP for Range 2 is
located on the AUX 9 runway (N32 39.490‘ W112 52.270‘). Do not point at or over fly the
RMCP when occupied.
3.18. Range 3. (Figure 3.8)
3.18.1. General. Target, reference points, and radar reflector coordinates are in Attachment 10.
Due to limited maneuvering airspace, fast movers using Range 3 will also be scheduled ETAC

3.18.5.5. Emergency Aircraft. Aircraft with emergencies requiring a straight-in approach to
Gila Bend Runway 35 may fly within 2 miles west of Range 3. Emergency aircraft en-route to
Gila Bend will transmit on Guard their flight path, altitude, and distance/time from GBAFAF.
Flights on Range 3 will orbit at or above 8,000‘ or as necessary to deconflict with emergency
aircraft. If weather prevents the above procedures, the flight will depart the range to the northeast
and orbit over ETAC in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) coordinating with ETAC
using flight.
3.18.5.6. Range 3 Pop/Range 2 NWD Pattern Conflict. Range 3 right range, left traffic pop
pattern will remain northeast of Hat Mountain to deconflict with Range 2‘s NWD final.
3.18.5.7. Class D Airspace. The north corner of Range 3 lies adjacent to the GBAFAF Class D
airspace.
3.18.5.8. Range 3 Range Munitions Consolidation Point (RMCP). The RMCP for Range
3/ETAC is located north of the range road, near the southwest end of the double-bladed ETAC
boundary at N 32 42.540‘ W 112 39.899‘ or 12SUB439203. (Note: when live AGM (Maverick
missiles) are expended on ETAC, personnel located on Range 3/ETAC border must relocate west
to at least Range 3 Flank Tower.)
3.18.5.9. Fast mover—helicopter joint use. Helicopters may operate in a designated section of
ETAC while fast movers are executing pop and NWD patterns on Range 3 (using ETAC
airspace). See Figure 3.10 During joint use, the NWD pattern is restricted to a 10 NM base and
only left traffic pop patterns will be flown. Targets 322 through 327 are closed during fast
mover—helicopter joint use.

3.19.5. Range 4 Primary Holding. Primary holding is west of Range 4 from 11,000‘ to 14,000‘
or surface to 5,000‘; hold within the restricted area, north of NTAC, 5-10 NM west of Range 4.
3.19.5.1. Range 4 Alternate Holding. With clearance from the RCO/flight lead, holding may be
accomplished over the range. RCO and flight leads will ensure a deconfliction plan is
established between arriving and departing flights.
3.19.6. Range 4 Entries.
3.19.6.1. NOLLS Entry. From NOLLS proceed direct to Range 4. If approaching NOLLS from
the east, remain north of R-2305 and deconflict overflight of GBAFAF (typical routing is south
of the GBAFAF runway, then NOLLS). Remain outside restricted airspace until cleared by the
RCO for clearance on range. (Caution: high volume traffic areas: GBAFAF (surface to
10,000‘) and NOLLS (7,000‘ – 9,000‘).)
3.19.6.2. Low Level/ MTR Entry. Typical entry is west-to-east. Remain below 5,000‘.
3.19.7. Range 4 Pattern Information, Conflicts, and Hazards.

                            UNMANNED TACTICAL RANGES

4.1. General. BMGR East contains four separate unmanned ranges. Air-to-Air (AA) is
designated for air combat/aerial gunnery employment, while NTAC, STAC, and ETAC are for
air-to-ground tactical employment. Each air-to-ground tactical range includes an array of targets
that simulate airfield, surface to air missile sites, convoys, and other facilities. Each air-to-
ground tactical range includes a target approved for live high-explosive ordnance delivery;
NTAC and ETAC also include targets for live air-to-ground missile employment. Based on the
unique nature of each range and its proximity to other maneuver areas, each range is further
defined in this chapter.

Figure 4.1. BMGR East Restricted Area Layout.




4.2. Airspace Defined. See specific range descriptions this chapter.
4.3. Classes of Ranges. Each unmanned range operates under Class C conditions even with
TACPs controlling aircraft on range.
4.4. Communication. Contact the Snakeye IAW Chapter 2 for range entry/departure. Based
on uncontrolled airspace and Class C operations, flights will make advisory calls to assigned and
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               57


adjacent airspace. Refer to Attachment 7 for specific range frequency allocations. If the
standard range working frequency will not be monitored, inform Snakeye of your working
frequency. Use of HAVE QUICK/Secure Voice or any non-standard frequency must be
coordinated with Snakeye. Flights must return to the standard range frequency for the last 5
minutes of their range time.
4.5. Target Specifics. Targets within the tactical areas consist of Sealand Containers, concrete
blocks, wooden mock-ups, Joint Modular Ground Targets (JMGT), and salvaged aircraft and
vehicles.      Refer to Attachment 11 for target centroid data.                      Refer to
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/aro for detailed target information. Weapons employment is strictly
limited to only those authorized target groups listed.
4.5.1. Areas of Critical Concern (ACCs). An ACC (e.g., UMTE or OP) on range is painted
white or marked by a white 50‘ diameter circle with a line through it for visual identification. To
avoid loss of life or expensive resources, pilots must ensure proper target identification to ensure
weapons are not employed on an ACC—anything painted white or associated with a circle/line is
not a target. Figures 2.2-2.4 depict the ACC locations in relation to authorized targets on the
unmanned ranges.
4.6. Authorized Ordnance. The BMGR East is a primary air-to-ground (WDZ) employment
range limited to ordnance listed in Attachment 8. Exceptions require approval by the 56
RMO/DIR. Surface fire (SDZ) can be accommodated on a case by case basis with coordination
and approval by 56 RMO/ARO.
4.6.1. Air Intercept Missile Employment. Requires 56 FW/CC approval. Units desiring live air-
to-air missile firing can submit requests to the 56 RMO for coordination.
4.6.2. Aerial Gunnery Employment. Requires 56 RMO/Director approval. Conduct aerial
gunnery training IAW para 4.11.9, AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures and
specific MDS series regulations.
4.6.3. Live Air-to-Ground Weapons Restrictions. The following are NOT AUTHORIZED on
HE targets: bombs with other than impact fusing (except FMU-113 or DSU-33), penetration
fuzing, and training ordnance. Additional restrictions include: wire-guided ordnance is only
authorized on ETAC; wires from wire-guided ordnance must be removed from the range by the
user, as soon as possible, but in no case later than the weekend following range usage;
CLUSTER SUB-MUNITION DISPENSING ORDNANCE AND HEI BULLETS ARE
PROHIBITED ON THE BMGR EAST COMPLEX.
4.6.4. Deployed Units Ordnance Restriction. Deployed units will not expend HE ordnance until
a dedicated range orientation mission (can be dry, training ordnance or inert ordnance) is
accomplished.
4.7. Delivery Considerations. Comply with target-weapon-delivery restrictions listed specific
target expanded data located at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/aro. Link on ―TAC Range Target
Information.‖ [IAW AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, WDZ Tool/SAFE-RANGE
weapons footprint program is used to determine weapons employment allowances. WDZ
Tool/SAFE-RANGE analysis considers two scenarios: low threat (LT) and high threat (HT).
LT is defined as limited to non-existent simulated enemy air defenses whereas HT is defined as
significant simulated enemy air defenses. Footprints are assessed to either contain the weapons

footprint within military controlled areas and/or to avoid manned areas (for example, a closed
range for maintenance).]
4.7.1. Personnel in Hazard Areas. IAW AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, access to
active hazard areas is limited to mission essential personnel and access to inactive hazard areas is
limited to essential personnel. However, if TACP/JTACs are on range, then AFI 11-214, Air
Operations Rules and Procedures takes precedence over WDZ Tool/SAFE-RANGE restrictions
(TACPs allowed inside a weapon footprint but still must comply with minimum distance from
target depending on weapon). If TACPs are on range yet your mission does not include their
control, it is advised to request ―Type 3‖ control. If ―Type 3‖ control is not granted, then pilots
must adjust profiles to ensure ground party is not located inside the hazard area.
4.7.2. Clearing Pass. The first flight of the day will make a dedicated clearing pass over the
range at an altitude that will allow the flight to clear the range of unauthorized personnel,
vehicles, or wildlife prior to expending any ordnance. Subsequent flights are also required to
perform a dedicated clearing pass, unless: (a) range personnel, JTAC, a departing flight or other
aircraft can confirm that the range is clear; (b) Snakeye relays that the range is clear from anyone
listed in (a), provided not more than 1 hour has expired. Night clearing will adhere to the day
procedures however may also accomplish a dry first run attack as a clearing pass IAW AFI 11-
214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
4.7.3. If unauthorized personnel or vehicles are observed on range, do not employ weapons and
immediately notify Snakeye. If wildlife is observed in the target area, do not employ weapons in
the immediate area.
4.8. Night Tactical Range Procedures. Night operations begin at official sunset. Any tactical
range can be scheduled for night operations. All aircraft will operate IAW specific aircraft
lighting requirements. Target illumination requirements, minimum and maximum number of
aircraft and patterns authorized will be according to applicable regulations and course phase
manuals.
4.8.1. Dud Illumination Flares. All flight members will be aware of the quantity of flares to be
dispensed for each type event. Duds and relative positions to the target will be called out by the
aircraft observing un-ignited flares.
4.9. Laser Procedures. See paragraph 2.13.
4.9.1. Laser Evaluator Systems - Mobile (LES-M). LES-Ms are in place on all TAC ranges.
ETAC has two systems. One at the 45 IP (N32 41.797‘ W112 35.782 1578‘) and one at the
MAV training target (N32 41.469‘ W112 29.844 1913‘). NTAC has one on a reference marker
northwest of the main airfield complex (N32 39.660‘ W113 12.687 791‘). STAC has one on a
reference marker northwest of the main airfield complex (N32 34.647‘ W113 15.732 725‘). The
system only works with a combat laser and is designed to provide an aural tone when the laser is
seen by the system. The tone will be heard on the respective TAC Range frequency indicating a
good laser spot on target. (Note: This is a dry only, no drop system.)
4.9.2. LSTSS. See paragraph 2.10.
4.10. TACP/JTAC Considerations. BMGR East supports regular TACP deployments to
control fighter missions from designated locations on the TAC ranges. When a TACP is
scheduled on range, Range Scheduling will annotate call sign and OP on the ―BMGR East
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                              59


NOTAMs.‖ Snakeye will advise all flights affected of TACP call sign and working frequency
upon initial check-in. For safety considerations, all flights will attempt to make contact with any
TACP reported within range airspace, even if not planning to utilize them. For safety and
awareness of the TACPs, unit schedulers must ensure that all GBU-10/12/16/24/31/32/38, LIVE
DROP, LIVE FIRE AGM and LASER missions are posted on the BMGR East schedule. Flight
Leads working with TACPs will ensure Snakeye is aware of the working frequency being used.
4.10.1. TACP Scheduling. TACP deployments require pre-coordination and approval at
minimum of one month prior through both 56 RMO/ASMS (DSN 896-7654/3330/8466) and 56
RMO/ARO (DSN 896-9687 / 8813).
4.10.2. TACP Required briefing. All TACP personnel who have not operated on the BMGR in
the previous 12 month period will obtain a detailed face-to-face briefing of TACP procedures on
the BMGR East and additional documentation from the 56 RMO/ARO office (located at Luke
AFB), prior to operating on the BMGR East. Those TACP who fall within the 12 month period
will still contact 56 RMO/ARO, but a face-to-face briefing may be deemed unnecessary.
4.10.3. TACP Liaison. A TACP liaison, knowledgeable of TACP procedures, will be positioned
at GBAFAF whenever TACPs are on the range. The TACP liaison will be the focal point of
contact via landline at DSN 896-1793 / 1794 or 1795 (Bldg 324 Room #11). The liaison is
responsible to ensure that TACPs are advised to clear the ranges for all LIVE AGM firing, where
applicable (See paragraph 4.10.9.1 for additional AGM guidance).
4.10.4. TACP Equipment. TACPs should bring all the equipment they need to operate on the
ranges, including at least one cellular phone (satellite phone desired) at each OP to facilitate
coordination of complex issues and minimize radio congestion. 56 RMO will provide range
specific land mobile radios for communication as well as GPS ground units (used for position
monitoring while on range). Both will be checked out from GBAFAF Base Operations prior to
deploying down range. To obtain a complete list of required equipment, contact 56 RMO/ARO.
4.10.5. TACP Positions. TACPs will not occupy or control from any points other than listed
below without specific written approval from 56 RMO/ARO. Personnel may climb to whatever
height is desired/required for target observation; vehicles must not leave the access road.
4.10.5.1. OP Alpha. Located in NTAC at N32 38.069‘ W113 09.242‘ or 12STB9793412815,

4.10.5.5. OP Echo. Located at N 32 30.948‘ W113 10.933‘ or 12STA9501999709, the west
face of a large hill next to the access road. TACPs must evacuate to at least the water well (N 32
32.170‘ W113 05.030‘) for HE AGMs
4.10.5.6. OP Foxtrot. Located at N 32 31.644‘ W 113 11.171‘ or 12STB946010. OP Foxtrot
was established specifically for threat emitter use and will not be scheduled when HE is
scheduled on STAC. Threat emitter operators or TACPs must evacuate to at least the water well
(N 32 32.170‘ W113 05.030‘) for HE AGMs
4.10.5.7. OP Red Point. Located at N 32 32.592‘ W113 17.608‘ or 12STB8463402966, the east
face of a hill, 4-5 km west of the STAC main airfield. OP Red Point will not be scheduled for
use when HE is scheduled or when OPs Delta and/or Echo are scheduled.
4.10.5.8. OP NATO Hill. Located at N32 39.193‘ W112 37.919‘ or 12SUB4694414011, on a
small hill overlooking the main airfield complex on ETAC. OP NATO Hill is coincident with an
UMTE site/RSS and a metal grating helicopter landing pad. OP NATO Hill is cleared for live
employment on Tgt 320 (HE Hill) however personnel other than TACPs (controlling the
mission) must vacate during AGM employment on Tgt 310.
4.10.6. TACP Movement. TACPs will not enter or exit the range, or depart an OP, without
specific approval from Snakeye.
4.10.7. TACP Communication. TACPs will attempt to maintain two-way radio communication
with Snakeye at all times. Note military land radio communication capability severely limited in
portions of the range. In the absence of a pre-briefed frequency TACPs will use and monitor the
appropriate primary range frequency.
4.10.8. Laser Use. Comply with paragraph 2.13.
4.10.8.1. TACPs will advise range scheduling of proposed ground designator laser use. TACPs
will advise Snakeye prior to commencing laser operations to alert any other ground party (threat
emitter) or aircraft in the vicinity. TACPs will use appropriate LEP anytime a laser is being used
(ground or air based). If LEPs are not available, the TACP will clear the range prior to the
airborne laser mission‘s range time.
4.10.9. TACP/Weapons Footprint Considerations.
4.10.9.1. HE AGM. IAW 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, TACPs are allowed to
remain on an OP if AGM-65 is being employed and the TACP is actively working the mission or
delegates ―Type 3‖ control to the pilot. Exception: OP Charlie unrestricted—OP is outside
normal AGM-65 footprint. AGM-114 employment, contact 56 RMO/DO or 56 RMO/ARO for
specific guidance.
4.10.9.2. TACPs are allowed to be inside any weapons footprint IAW AFI 11-214, Air
Operations Rules and Procedures, guidance when actively controlling missions or delegating
―Type 3‖ control to the flight on range. If the pilot is not using the TACP or Type 3 is not
delegated, then IAW AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, WDZ Tool/SAFE-RANGE
procedures, the TACP must exit or the pilot must restrict weapons employment to ensure the
ground party is not within the weapons footprint.
4.10.10. Marking. In the shape of a triangle. TACPs will mark their site if possible during the
day. At night, the position should be marked with three flashing beacons (may be covert when
NVGs are used by the controlled aircraft).
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                          61


4.10.11. Positive Identification (ID). TACPs will ensure pilots have a positive ID on the TACP
position prior to employment—no ordnance expenditure or LASING is authorized until each
aircraft has called a positive identification of the GFAC site.
4.10.12. All information pertaining to TACP scheduling and operations can be found at the 56
RMO scheduling website https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/BMGR-E or by contacting 56 RMO/ARO

N32 25‘   W113 33‘     to the beginning.

4.11.9. Communications. Reference Attachment 7 for frequency allocation. Flight leads will
call on GUARD stating that "R-2301E will be hot with live aerial gunnery for the next XX
minutes," prior to any shooting. Radio contact between tow and shooter aircraft is mandatory.
The active shooter will acknowledge all calls. It is the tow pilot‘s responsibility to provide
Snakeye with the following information: shooter and tow (primary and spare) call signs; lead
shooter‘s squadron and home base, if other than regular users; when the secondary frequency is
being used; or when any target is shot off or dropped on the range.
4.11.10. Information, Conflicts, and Hazards.
4.11.10.1. Live Aerial Gunnery missions will be conducted IAW applicable directives.
4.11.10.2. Safety. Once on the range, the shooter flight lead becomes the Air-to-Air Range
Control Officer (AA RCO).
4.11.10.3. Towing Procedures. Tow aircraft will ensure that targets are not launched over
NTAC/STAC. A warning radio call will precede target launch. A chase aircraft should monitor
target deployment, but is not mandatory.
4.11.10.4. Patterns. All patterns described in AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
Procedures, and AFI 11-MDS series publications, training manuals, or other applicable
regulations are authorized. It is the responsibility of both the AA RCO and the tow pilot to
ensure that pattern size and orientation do not exceed the prescribed confines of the range, and
that they only fire over approved areas. Orient the pattern with the axis of the pattern NNW to
SSE. Do not allow firing on the target if the shooter is headed outbound, within 2 NM of the
borders.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             63


4.11.10.5. Minimums. Minimum altitudes are according to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
and Procedures, or other applicable regulations. Weather minimums are: at least 1,000‘ above
the highest altitude (perch/observation) to be used, 5 NM visibility, and VFR must be
maintained.
4.11.10.5.1. Weather. Pilots may fire on the target above an undercast provided the area is clear
of activity, GCI or ACMI is used to provide positive area monitor, and GBAFAF weather is at
least a 4,000‘ ceiling (for a DART drop). AA RCOs and flight leads should ensure aircraft
radars are used to clear the area and INS/ TACAN are used to remain in the shoot box.
4.11.10.6. DART/AGTS Drops. The primary drop area is 4,000‘ short and east of the approach
end of Runway 35 at Gila Bend AFAF. Contact GBAFAF Tower and descend to 2,500‘ for the
drop. After the drop, confirm with shooter escort or the Tower Controller that the DART/AGTS
and all cables have been successfully released.
4.11.10.6.1. On-Range Release/Drop. When circumstances require target or cable release on
range, plan the drop so impact will occur north of N32 25.00 (CPNWR northern boundary). If
above an undercast cloud deck, and the tow aircraft is unable to tow the DART/AGTS to
GBAFAF, attempt to clear the range airspace with GCI radar prior to release of the
DART/AGTS on range.
4.11.10.6.2. Random Drops. Random target drops on the AA range are prohibited.
4.12. NTAC Range.
4.12.1. NTAC Impact Area. For NTAC weapons employment, pilots must be thoroughly aware
of the impact area boundaries and ensure mission materials are sufficient for in-flight assessment
of off-range impacts. NTAC impact area is defined as the area on the range immediately
surrounding the target(s) or designated mean point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance
delivery. The Impact Area demarcation will be no less than 500 feet from the center of the target
or designated mean point of impact (DMPI) approved for live ordnance and 300 feet from the
center of the target or DMPI used solely for inert or practice ordnance. (Note: For impacts
greater than 1000 meters from intended target, pilots will immediately discontinue weapons
employment and report details of the incident to Snakeye)

                                          Chapter 5

                  RANGE CONTROL OFFICER (RCO) PROCEDURES

5.1. General. RCOs are under the supervision and control of the 56 RMO ACTS Contractor
Extenuating circumstances may make it necessary for pilots to augment the RCOs. In this event,
56 RMO will task specific units allowing sufficient time for training and certification in
accordance with this chapter. RCOs are responsible for respective manned range ground and air
space and the safe conduct of weapons employment operations.
5.2. Tour of Duty. The normal RCO tour of duty will be 8 hours, not to exceed 12 hours in any
one 24-hour period. The maximum number of duty hours in any 7 days will be 60, which may
be waived on a case-by-case basis by the ROA. Only qualified officers, NCOs, or civilians
(government employees or contractors) may perform RCO duties. All RCOs (military or
civilian) will meet the qualification, training, certification, currency, evaluation, and
recordkeeping requirements listed in Attachment 13.
5.3. RCO Training, Checkout, and Certification.
5.3.1. General. Training and certification requirements are established in and will be conducted
IAW this supplement (see Attachment 13).
5.3.2. RCO Training and Certification. The 56 RMO representative, or a current and qualified
RCO, will conduct RCO training. Certification will be accomplished by the 56 RMO
representative or by a designated RCO. RCO certification and annual re-certification will be
documented on an RCO Certificate for BMGR East (Attachment 12) and maintained by the
contractor.
5.3.3. RCO Currency. The contactor will ensure RCOs meet the following requirements.
Additionally, RCOs will complete an annual evaluation by demonstrating control of 2-day
missions (at least one of which will be a four-ship, if able) and passing a written examination.
The evaluation will be administered by a 56 RMO representative or designated representative.
RCO‘s who fail their annual evaluation are immediately decertified.
5.3.3.1. RCO Recurrency. See Attachment 13.
5.3.4. RCO Meetings. The 56 RMO will conduct semiannual RCO meetings as a minimum. All
RCOs must attend each meeting or be briefed on the meeting subjects. Meeting minutes will be
maintained by the 56 RMO.
5.3.5. Aircrew Training and Certification. In the event pilots are required to augment the
contract RCOs, training and certification will be conducted by a 56 RMO representative.
Certification will be documented on the RCO Certificate for BMGR East and maintained in
respective training folders. The RCO Certificate for BMGR East will be maintained in the
respective RCO‘s training folder, maintained by BMGR ACTS contractor.
5.4. Air-to-Air Range Control Officer Program. Each unit conducting aerial gunnery
operations in the R-2301E, AIR-TO-AIR Range, will develop an AA RCO Program according to
AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations and applicable supplements. Units conducting
aerial gunnery operations on the BMGR East will provide a list of current AA RCOs to 56
RMO/ARO upon request.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            71


5.5. Instructions, Regulations, and Manuals. Each manned range tower will be have a quick
response checklist for items regarding divert instructions, backup communications, crash and
emergency procedures, safety items, etc. Additionally each manned range tower will have
current copies of AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, plus applicable extracts from the
F-16 AFI 11-series, A-10 AFI 11-series, and AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
5.6. Other Range Publications/Documents.
5.6.1. Local Publications. The 56 RMO/QAE (COR) will ensure applicable local publications
are established, and maintained at each range, and that one copy of each publication is forwarded
to 56 RMO/ARO.
5.6.2. Visitors Log. A visitor‘s log will be maintained at each manned range. All personnel not
assigned range duties will sign the visitors‘ log.
5.6.3. LAFB Form 57, Range Officer’s Report. Back up documentation in the event computer
access downrange is inhibited. This report will be completed by the RCO for each tour of duty
as required. The report will be forwarded to the ACTS contractor for review, tracking, and
filing.
5.6.4. Down Range Computer. The RCO will ensure the down range computer (located in the
tower cab) is on and operational. Its purpose is to enhance an RCO‘s knowledge with respect to
weather, NOTAMS, Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) advisories (per Luke OPlan 91-1),
CSE use (scheduling updates and weapons expenditure logging), and foul tracking log.
Information gained from using the computer and local area network access should be used in the
Command, Control, and Communications (C3) of manned range operations.
5.7. Range Opening Procedures.
5.7.1. RCO Showtime. The RCO will be at the scheduled range a minimum of 1 hour prior to
the first scheduled range period.
5.7.2. RCO Notification. The RCO will notify Snakeye when arriving at the range.
5.7.3. RCO Inspection Checklist. Prior to the first mission, the RCO will complete the Range
Officer‘s Inspection Checklist.
5.7.4. RCO Range Status Report. No later than 15 minutes prior to the first mission, the RCO
will notify Snakeye of range status. Upon notification, Snakeye will relinquish control of the
manned range air and ground space to the RCO (depending on expected missions).
5.8. Operations.
5.8.1. Range Schedule. The RCO is responsible for managing their respective Range Flight
Schedule. Advise flight leads when 5 minutes remain in their scheduled period if another flight
is scheduled immediately afterward. Do not allow flights to extend their period without
concurrence of the inbound flight. Day range activities will cease NLT official sunset, or 1800
whichever occurs first (for range scheduling purposes only).
5.8.1.1. Last mission of the day extensions. RCOs may approve range extensions up to 30
minutes past scheduled end time without outside approval provided RCO duty day limitations
are not effected. Extension requests beyond 30 minutes require QAE/COR approval. RCOs will
notify Snakeye (in turn approval from 56 RMO/DO or QAE/COR) if a flight requests to extend
past 30 minutes scheduled time as soon as possible so as to minimize effect on requesting flight.
 72                                               AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


5.8.2. Flight Operations. Flights are responsible for obtaining current altimeter setting and
GBAFAF active runway from Snakeye prior to entry. Clearance onto a manned range, when not
previously scheduled or for range diversions, may be coordinated with Snakeye. Snakeye will
inform the affected RCO. The RCO will advise flights where EOD detonation activity or EOD
operations are in progress, as applicable.
5.8.2.1. Lineup/Recoveries. Prior to weapons delivery, flight leaders will confirm the lineup
(number of aircraft), events (number and type, to include dive angle, type of recovery), LASER
events, and targets. All flights will execute a climbing safe escape maneuver for all conventional
deliveries, unless otherwise briefed by the flight lead.
5.8.2.2. Range Traffic/Data. The RCO will confirm right or left conventional range and traffic,
strafe panel assignment, and when requested, the current altimeter, surface winds, and any other
information requested by the flight lead that can be obtained while safely controlling the flight.
5.8.2.3. RCO Communications. RCOs are expected to become part of the using flight,
sequencing radio calls with the flight to enhance communication flow. The RCO will insist that
flight members acknowledge all directive RCO radio transmissions (other than normal bombing
pattern standard communication).
5.8.2.4. Clearing. The RCO will clear every pass hot or dry (―cleared hot‖ or ―continue dry‖)
after the pilot has called ―in‖ and ensuring that the target area is clear, the requesting aircraft is
on range, in sight, and aligned with the correct target.
5.8.2.5. Flight Lead Control. The RCO will allow ―flight lead control‖ when flight lead requests
such for dry Maverick passes, or other similar events. The RCO may also allow ―flight lead
control‖ with ordnance expenditures when environmental conditions preclude the ranger from
ensuring all the criteria specified in paragraph 5.8.2.4 are met. ―Flight lead control‖ must be
accepted and acknowledged by both the flight lead and the RCO. Under ‗flight lead control‘
during HADB/HARB events, aircraft releasing actual or simulated ordnance will call ―in‖ or ―in,
dry‖, and ―off dry‖, as appropriate. No clearance to expend will be transmitted from the RCO or
flight lead. The intent is to issue an advisory radio call to the RCO/flight members that an
aircraft is committed to a weapons release pass. RCO‘s will continue to spot actual ordnance
releases to validate weapons expenditure and impact location. When the range is released to
"flight lead control," the RCOs will continue to monitor the flight as a ground safety observer.
The RCO will not allow any range maintenance to be conducted when ordnance is being
expended under ―flight lead control‖ or any high altitude delivery.
5.8.2.6. Spacing. If spacing affects safety or scoring capability, direct the flight to open or close
spacing, where needed, or go through "high and dry" until corrected.
5.8.2.7. Strafe. The RCOs will not allow range maintenance during any hot strafe events.
5.8.2.8. Strafe Restrictions. Any of the following conditions constitute strafe restrictions due to
the associated ricochet hazard and the possibility of personnel west of the targets: insufficient
soil depth to reduce bullet velocity; when the soil consistency turns to a powdery texture; when
standing water exists within the pits or on the aprons around the pits; when the pit soil has
crusted to an extent where it does not break when walked upon.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               73


5.8.2.8.1. Ranges 1 or 3, Conventional strafe pits will be closed. Strafe is not authorized since it
is impossible to ensure that personnel are not behind the range. Tactical strafe target: closed to
ordnance delivery with standing water nearby.
5.8.2.8.2. Range 2 or 4. Conventional strafe pits: Only A-10 LAS is authorized and the aircraft
must not penetrate the 3-9 line of the strafe panels. Tactical strafe target: strafe authorized for
all aircraft with standing water nearby.
5.8.3. Communications.
5.8.3.1. Main Tower. Each manned range is outfitted with a primary UHF radio, UHF Guard;
UHF/VHF multichannel secondary radio; Land Mobile Radio; and hot mic capability to the
scoring position. The primary UHF radio is tuned to the specific range frequency. The multi-
channel is available for backup, set on Snakeye frequency. On Range 3, the multi-channel will
be set to ETAC discrete if joint-use procedures are in effect. If the primary radio fails, contact
the aircraft on the multi-channel. If no contact, notify Snakeye to inform the flight of the
situation and the anticipated delay, if known.
5.8.3.2. Minimum Radios. The range may be opened with one operational UHF radio (either
primary or secondary; if secondary, one channel will be tuned to UHF guard). In this instance,
advise Snakeye and incoming flights of limited capability. Advise ACTS contractor of outage to
initiate a work order.
5.8.3.3. Aircraft Radio Failure. The RCO will advise other flight members when an aircraft flies
past the tower rocking its wings as a NORDO signal. If the aircraft remains in the traffic pattern,
the RCO may attempt, with coordination with the flight lead/wingman, to contact the NORDO
aircraft on backup frequency with the multi-channel UHF. If contact is established, advise the
flight lead/wingman, and recommend that the entire flight work on the backup frequency.
Continue the mission after all flight members are in contact with the range. If the aircraft breaks
out opposite traffic, an emergency is indicated—advise other flight members as appropriate.
5.8.3.4. Digital Recorder. All ground to air, air to air and ground to ground communications on
each manned range are digitally recorded. Each RCO will title the recording RCO‘s name, time,
and current weather before the first flight of the day, IAW Opening Checklist procedures.
Recordings will be held a minimum of 24 hours before reuse. In the event of an incident the
RCO will record the time of the incident on the RCO Incident Report.
5.8.3.5. FM Radio Operations. FM or land mobile radio (LMR) is a necessary means of
communication on the manned ranges to talk with Snakeye or equipped ground parties. The FM
radio in the main tower may be turned down to a low but readable volume during missions.
Under no circumstances will the FM radio be turned off/audio full down while the range is
manned.
5.8.3.6. Clearance to Enter/Cross Manned Ranges.
5.8.3.6.1. Aircraft. All aircraft must be cleared on range by the RCO prior to entry if range is
active with using traffic (through Snakeye coordination if necessary). Crossing traffic may be
cleared if the range is cold or after using flight coordination (altitude and or distance
deconfliction) and permission.
5.8.3.6.2. Ground Parties. Ground parties requesting access to manned ranges will not proceed
beyond the range entry point(s) until clearance is granted. The telephone at the entry point may
 74                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


be used but LMR communication is common. When a mission is in progress, only the RCOs
will determine whether access is safe and grant clearance accordingly. Clearance authority
cannot be delegated. Restrictions in Table 5.1 apply for travel between main and flank towers
during weapon employment due to weapons safety footprints.

                                                 are in use
5.8.4. Night Range Operations. Night minimum altitude devices are available; however, they
are not as effective as the daylight devices. Increased emphasis is required for aircraft position
and attitude. Diving deliveries on the conventional target by non-LANTIRN aircraft will be
permitted if the target area is illuminated by airborne flares or at least two ground marking
devices within 300‘ of the target or if illuminations conditions exist where in the pilot can
positively identify the target (for example, with night vision goggles). When working flare
missions, the RCOs will call out the number of flares observed if less than indicated by the flare
ship, and warn aircrew if a flare could affect the pattern.

5.9.1.4. A lazy recovery on LAS, all recoveries not IAW T.O. -34-1.
5.9.1.5. Dropping without clearance.
5.9.1.6. A violation of range or flight safety (dangerous pass as assessed by the RCO).
5.9.1.6.1. A single violation of range or flight safety, as judged by the RCO or flight lead, may
be considered dangerous by the RCO or flight lead, which will require the flight member to
discontinue events and hold high and dry above the range.
5.9.2. Fouls. Advise pilots of minimums or other deviations/violations that occur. Include
specific reasons for fouls. Do not clear follow-on passes of that aircraft until that pilot
acknowledges the foul. Aircrew will discontinue and hold high and dry above the range after
receiving a second foul.
5.9.3. Foul Recording. The RCO will ensure foul/ dangerous pass information is recorded on
the computer (WISS/IRSSS) score sheet and LAFB Form 57 Range Officer’s Report.
5.10. Weapons Delivery Scoring.
5.10.1. Bullseye Point. Bullseye eye is the center of the target.
5.10.2. Score Passing. RCOs will pass scores by miss distance and clock positions (for
example, 8 at 6). A score of three meters or less will be passed as a "Bull." If warranted, a
―Shack‖ may be passed as a direct hit on the bullseye. For fouls: No score will be given over
the radio or on the computer score sheet when a foul related to that event occurs.
5.10.3. Strafe. When possible, RCOs will advise pilots of strafe impacts outside of the center of
the impact area.
5.11. Curtailed Range Operations.
5.11.1. Weather Reporting. When weather is a factor, the RCO will obtain range weather from
the weather station, local PIREPs, and make observations to ensure that arriving flights are
accurately briefed on current conditions before entering the range complex. The RCO will close
the range when PIREPs or RCO observation confirms the weather is below the minimums.
5.11.2. Flight ―Terminate‖ or ―Knock-It-Off‖ calls, or Aircraft emergency.
5.11.2.1. The RCO will: acknowledge the call, then maintain radio silence and assist as
required; visually monitor flight members to assist in safe separation; if the emergency aircraft
proceeds to GBAFAF for a precautionary/emergency landing, advise Snakeye.
5.11.3. Unauthorized Airspace Incursions. Call a ―knock-it-off‖, direct aircraft as required
deconflicting flight paths, then alerting the flight lead of the intruding aircraft‘s location. If
necessary, make a call on guard to alert the flight which range they are on and the best direction
to leave the airspace (for example, ―Range 4 on guard, F-XX over Range 4 work West

immediately‖). Report airspace violations to Snakeye and initiate a BMGR East Incident Report
(Attachment 4).
5.11.4. Crash. Close the range and direct the using flight to either breakout/depart the range or
act as Rescue Combat Air Patrol (RESCAP). RCOs will remain in the tower, and assist as
required. Advise Snakeye of status as soon as possible and the GBAFAF ECC for crash net
activation with all available details to include:
5.11.4.1. Call sign/Flight position
5.11.4.2. Type aircraft, tail number, and home base.
5.11.4.3. Exact location and time.
5.11.4.4. Status of aircrew members, if known.
5.11.4.5. Ordnance on board, if known.
5.11.5. Unauthorized Personnel. Suspend operations immediately and notify Snakeye of the
situation and anticipated delay. During range closures for unauthorized personnel, the RCO may
allow missions to work the range ―dry only‖ above 500‘ AGL. If the search involves law
enforcement aircraft, the restriction will be ―dry only‖ and 1,000‘ AGL above the search aircraft.
5.11.6. Ricochet. If an aircraft experiences an impact due to ricochet, suspend all LAS activities
and provide emergency assistance to the affected aircraft, as necessary. Complete an incident
report according to paragraph 5.13.1 below.
5.11.7. Special Instructions.
5.11.7.1. Range 2 is using left range/ right traffic. The Range 2 RCO will advise Range 4 RCO,
and NWD/LANTIRN patterns will be restricted to 7 NM finals. The RCO will clear flights for
this pattern using the terminology "cleared right range, left traffic" or "cleared left range, right
traffic.
5.11.7.2. Abnormal Occurrences. On manned ranges, the RCO will immediately notify Snakeye
and/or 56 RMO DO/ARO of any abnormal occurrences. Document any abnormal occurrence
(e.g., jettison, inadvertent release, range incursions, etc.) on a BMGR East Incident Report
(Attachment 4) and forward to 56 RMO/DO/ARO by end of day.
5.12. Normal Range Closing. Under normal conditions, the range may be closed with
coordination through Range Scheduling/Snakeye.
5.13. Reports and Logs. RCOs will review discrepancy logs and other documents to ensure
accuracy and legibility. The RCO will upload weapons expenditures in CSE and annotate fouls
on the BMGR East foul tracking excel spreadsheet by the completion of manned range tour. As
a backup to computer downtime, the LAFB Form 57 Range Officer’s Report may be used.
5.13.1. Ricochet information. Report the following to Snakeye, 56 FW/SE, and Luke AFB
command post:
5.13.1.1. Aircraft type, call sign, home base.
5.13.1.2. Time of occurrence, type event, and target.
5.13.1.3. Target condition, pre-opening inspection results, time of last plowing/hand policing,
etc.

              SURFACE ACCESS TO CONTROL AREAS OF BMGR EAST

6.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for surface access to restricted military land
within BMGR East. Strict adherence to these procedures is absolutely necessary to ensure safe
and efficient operations.
6.2. Overview. All DoD managed land within BMGR East is considered a control area, and
specific sections are classified as either standard control areas (SCA) or critical control areas
(CCA). Specific access procedures are slightly different for each of these control areas.
6.2.1. Areas Adjacent to BMGR East. Most areas that border BMGR East are managed by other
government agencies. Access to theses areas is not authorized without prior approval. Specific
access procedures for these areas are beyond the scope of this supplement. For access clearance

6.3. Standard Control Areas. Limited areas of the BMGR East are authorized for public
recreational use with official permit. Although air-to-ground weapons employment is not
authorized in these areas, access to SCAs must be closely monitored due to the potential for
employment errors that may result in weapons impacts outside of the intended target area.
Depending on military operations, some areas may be temporarily closed to public access.
6.3.1. Specific SCAs are: Area B, the Ajo Air Force Station, and Bender Springs.
6.3.2. SCA Controlling Agency. The controlling agency for all SCAs is the GBAFAF Security
Office (24/7).
6.3.3. SCA Access.
6.3.3.1. Recreational permits for entry to Area B, portions of the Ajo Air Force Station, and
Bender Springs are issued IAW 56 RMO OI 1-3, at GBAFAF, the 56 RMO/PA Office, the
Public Lands Information Center, the Marine Corps Air Station-Yuma, the Cabeza Prieta
Wildlife Refuge, and the BLM Phoenix Field Office. These permits are also valid for
recreational visits to the western section of the BMGR (R-2301 West), BLM Sonoran Desert
National Monument (formerly known as Area A), and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife
Refuge managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Individuals are issued the permit in
duplicate; one copy must be carried by the permit holder at all times, and the other copy left on
the vehicle dashboard. All visitors must be prepared to present the permit when requested by
any government official.

depicts a statement of briefing accomplishment that must be signed by the individual at the
completion of the briefing and will remain valid for one year.
6.3.5. SCA Communication Rules. Visitors are required to advise security of area of interest
and duration of stay. Visitors will advise security when entering and exiting SCAs.
6.3.6. Failure to Clear a Range. If personnel fail to notify GB Security of SCA exit, the
controlling agency will make every attempt to contact the personnel in question. If unable to
establish contact the controlling agency will immediately report this incident to Snakeye,
RMO/DO, and Gila Bend QAE/COR. The RMO/DO will determine if a ground search is
warranted.
6.4. Critical Control Areas. Sections of the range intended for air-to-air and air-to-ground
weapons employment. All CCAs are official business only. Official duties are defined as
activities sanctioned by 56 FW/RMO for the purpose of operating and maintaining the range
complex, the use of the range complex for ground and air military training and exercises, or other
governmental or civilian agency uses officially authorized by the USAF in writing. Specific
CCA‘s are:
Manned Ranges 1, 2, 3, and 4
East, North, or South Tactical Range
Air-to-Air Gunnery Range
AUX-6
BMGR East Small Arms Range
All connecting areas between the manned and tactical ranges
6.4.1. Hazard Areas. The Hazard Area is a composite of all WDZs and surface danger zones
(SDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events against targets or DMPIs approved for actual
ordnance expenditures. All hazard areas on the BMGR East are contained within the boundaries
of the east and west containment areas (see Figure 6.1). Hazard areas exist and are active only
when weapons are being employed against authorized targets. Access to active Hazard Areas is
limited to Mission Essential Personnel. All other access is limited to Essential Personnel.

Figure 6.1. BMGR East Containment Areas.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               81




6.4.1. CCA Access.
6.4.1.1. Scheduling Coordination. For other than GBAFAF operations and maintenance
activity, requests for access to CCAs must be coordinated at least 14 calendar days prior with
56 RMO Range Scheduling (DSN 896-3185 or COMM 623-856-3185). Ground access to any
CCA during scheduled range operation hours must be annotated on the range master schedule.
Ground access at times other than scheduled range operating hours does not need be annotated
on the master schedule but notification/approval for access must be coordinated/communicated
with 56 RMO/ARO or the controlling agency.
6.4.1.2. Range Safety Briefing. The Range Safety Briefing is required prior to access to any
CCA. This briefing is conducted at Luke AFB by 56 RMO/ARO. It also can be conducted by
Environmental Sciences Management Section at Luke AFB or at GBAFAF (QAE/COR or
Security office) with approval from 56 RMO/ARO office. Attachment 14 depicts a statement of
briefing accomplishment that must be signed by the individual at the completion of the briefing
and will remain valid for one year.
6.4.1.2.1. Accident response. In the event of accident or injury contact Snakeye or GBAFAF
security for response. 24/7 medical response is available at GBAFAF, however no medical
facilities are within the local area (nearest facility is Phoenix metro area). Depending an severity
of injury commercial medivac is preferred method of transportation. (see paragraph 1.11.3)
6.4.2. Luke AFB Form 11, Acknowledgement of Danger, Release, and Hold Harmless
Agreement Goldwater Air Force Range Visit. LAFB Form 11 applies to all personnel accessing
CCAs except for: 56 RMO staff and contractor personnel and military personnel.
6.4.3. CCA Controlling Agency. During scheduled range operating hours, the controlling
agency for all CCAs is Snakeye or a manned range RCO. During times other than scheduled
range operating hours, the controlling agency is the GBAFAF Security Office and all ground
access communication rules will comply with paragraph 6.4.1. If in doubt of range status, all
personnel will first attempt contact with Snakeye first before attempting to contact the GBAFAF
Security Office.
6.4.4. CCA Communication. All ground parties will request clearance for entry; advise area of
operations and expected exit time; maintain radio communication while on range; and advise
 82                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


when exiting the range (see expanded information below). Due to the inherent hazards of access
to CCAs, failure to adhere to communication rules will result in notification of the individual‘s
unit commander and may lead to suspension of range access privileges.
6.4.4.1. Communication Means. Personnel must use all means possible to contact the
controlling agency during entry and exit. These means include: FM radio, UHF or VHF radio,
and telephone (land line or mobile). Additionally, GPS ground tracking devices (if tracking) will
be used to aid in Snakeye‘s situational awareness of the ground party. LMR radios and GPS
tracking devices will be checked out from GBAFAF base operations prior to deploying
downrange.
6.4.5. Entry Clearance. Prior to entering any area, personnel must contact Snakeye for access
coordination. If Snakeye is the controlling agency for the area requested, they will provide
instructions on how to proceed; if they are not the controlling agency (active manned range) then
Snakeye will direct the ground party to contact the appropriate manned range RCO. If scheduled
for an entry window on the range master schedule, personnel must be prepared to enter
immediately at the beginning of the window. However, there is no implied automatic entry
approval associated with an entry window. If approval is denied, the controlling agency should
direct personnel to hold outside the area and await further instructions. In the event there is no
response, or communication is garbled and unreadable, personnel will hold outside the requested
area and continue to attempt contact. When requesting entry, personnel will specify their
projected destination(s) and projected departure time. The destination information is meant to
facilitate search and rescue, if required, and will be passed to the controlling agency in the form
of OPs, UTMs, Lat/Long, target reference #‘s, or geographic references.
6.4.6. Exit Coordination. For an active CCA, personnel will hold at the briefed destination until
cleared by the controlling agency. If scheduled for an exit window on the range master schedule,
personnel must be prepared to exit immediately at the beginning of the window. There is no
implied automatic exit approval associated with an entry window. Immediately after exiting any
area, personnel must report clear of the appropriate area boundary to the controlling agency. If
unable to establish immediate contact, personnel will continue to use every means available to
report clear, to include using the nearest available land line. (Note: The controlling agency will
assume personnel remain in the requested area until those personnel report clear, and this may
require termination of training on the range)
6.4.7. Failure to Clear a Range. If personnel fail to notify the controlling agency of range exit,
the controlling agency will make every attempt to contact the personnel in question. If unable to
establish contact one hour after the projected departure time, the controlling agency will
immediately report this situation to Snakeye, RMO/DO, GBAFAF Security Office, and Gila
Bend QAE/COR. The RMO/DO will determine if a ground search is warranted.
6.5. Tours and Visit Requests. Personnel desiring a tour to a manned range or tactical range
should contact the 56 RMO public affairs (DSN 896-8516/COMM 623-856-8516).
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                              83


                                            Chapter 7

  RANGE OPERATIONS COORDINATION CENTER (ROCC) RESPONSIBILITIES

7.1. General.
7.1.1. Snakeye is responsible for the daily schedule to include all 56 FW SUA and military
training routes; range and airspace utilization data gathering for reporting purposes; controlled
access to ground and airspace and proactive airspace monitoring/advisory service.
7.1.2. Based on the unique nature of the range, all radar operators will have been previously
rated in an ATC/RAPCON/MRU/or GCI facility. Proof of rating will be required before
assuming duties in the ROCC, and will be maintained in individual training records. All duties
related to ROCC will require this minimum experience rating, to include Northern and Southern
Airspace positions, as well as the Ground position. Meeting these minimum experience
requirements and completion of all ROCC training will determine a ―Certified Operator‖ for the
ROCC facility. Unrated personnel formerly ―grandfathered‖ into a ―previously rated‖
experience required position without legitimate prior rating, listed above, will not be accepted.
7.1.3. Snakeye Operators will rotate from day shift to evening shift and from evening shift to
day shift once a month in order to maintain proficiency with each shift‘s unique requirements.
The rotation to the alternate shift will last for a minimum of one week. A normal operator shift
should be considered 8 hours, but will not exceed 10 hours. A scheduled off-duty period
between shifts will occur for each operator; the duration of the off-duty period will be at least 8
hours. When unforeseen events prevent staffing as scheduled (emergency leaves, short notice
unexpected loss of personnel, etc.), shift limitations may be waived by the government.
7.1.4. Snakeye is not an ATC facility but will take a proactive roll in granting access,
monitoring of airspace, and advising military flights in the interest of flight safety. Snakeye
radar operators will be certified by the 56 RMO/ASM office. Training will be IAW Attachment
14.
7.1.5. Snakeye will be operational anytime missions are scheduled for 56 FW managed airspace.
Exceptions may be granted through coordination with 56 RMO Director. The ROCC will open
one hour prior to the start of the first scheduled range mission. The 8 hour time frame beginning
with the first scheduled mission will be considered ―day-shift‖ operations; the period following
this time frame will be the evening shift. Snakeye will close 15 minutes after all aircraft have
cleared the airspace.
7.1.6. The ROCC is an integral part of range and airspace safety. Operators will report
violations of safety rules for aircraft and ground personnel via the BMGR East Incident Report
(Attachment 4). Operators will wear headsets at all times during hours of operation when ―in
position‖ at the radar (Northern and Southern Airspace) positions for safety purposes.
7.2. Scheduling Responsibilities.
7.2.1. The ROCC will assume control of the flying schedule (CSE) at 1600L the day prior to
execution.
7.2.2. Coordinate as necessary add-ons and changes to the schedule under ROCC personnel
control.
 84                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


7.2.3. Units may call Snakeye and schedule unused airspace within the parameters allowed by
the contract. For example, 56 RMO can accept add-ons when the requested times are after the
first scheduled unit and before the last scheduled unit. If outside published or scheduled times,
contact 56 RMO/DO/ARO for coordination and direction. Note. In this case both GBAFAF and
Snakeye support is effected.
7.3. Data Gathering Responsibilities.
7.3.1. Using CSE, annotate flight entry and exit times for specific airspace and/or sub-range.
7.3.2. Log munitions expenditures in CSE by airframe, unit, munitions type and number, and
target group.
7.3.2.1. Maintain a daily radar operator event log. Forward log (electronic means preferred) to
56 RMO/ASM for review on a daily basis.
7.3.3. Range Closure Reporting. Annotate and log range closure as a result of unforeseen
personnel on range (e.g., CBP or illegal aliens) or any other unusual circumstance.
7.3.4. Weather capping data.
7.3.5. Impact to mission and if non effective provide reason.
7.4. Range and Airspace Supervision.
7.4.1. Snakeye is the single point of contact for airspace and range access and has the authority
to grant or deny access as appropriate.
7.4.1.1. Operators will provide flights the current GBAFAF runway-in-use and altimeter setting
prior to entry in the airspace. Clearance onto a range not previously scheduled or for range
diversions, may be coordinated directly with the respective RCO.
7.4.1.2. Operators will advise flight leads when their scheduled period is over and if another
flight is scheduled immediately afterward. Do not allow flights to exceed their period without
concurrence of the inbound flight.
7.4.1.3. Last mission of the day extensions. Operators may approve airspace extensions up to 30
minutes past scheduled end time without outside approval. At no time will airspace be extended
beyond what is scheduled with Albuquerque Center on the flying schedule without prior
coordination.
7.4.1.4. Operators will advise flights when EOD detonation activity or EOD operations are in
progress, as applicable.
7.4.2. ROCC personnel will review local area NOTAMS (FAA and Range) and provide
advisories to pilots as required (e.g., fire restrictions, TFR‘s, CBP operations, etc.).
7.4.3. A dedicated radar position will be manned for each geographically separated operating
areas (e.g., BMGR East complex and Gladden Bagdad MOA/ATCAA).
7.4.3.1. The main point of reference for situational awareness will be the radar, backed up by the
daily schedule. The Radar Acquisition and Display System (RADS) display system will be used
for traffic surveillance and identification.
7.4.3.2. Operators will monitor the radar for emergencies, downed aircraft, aircraft spill-ins/outs,
law enforcement aircraft and general airspace intrusions/traffic. Proactively provide situational
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                                 85


awareness (traffic information) to using flights of stranger traffic that could affect their mission
(safety).
7.4.3.3. Ensure military aircraft squawk IAW paragraph 2.6.3.1.
7.4.3.4. Provide immediate airspace use awareness to incoming-departing flights. Example,
flight approaching ARSON for STAC: Provide potential traffic conflicts/pointouts, airspace
status, additional appropriate NOTAMS, then GBAFAF runway, altimeter; grant access if range
time and airspace is clear.(for example, ―Salter, traffic southwest your position, 7 miles, 7,000’
westbound, unverified; Gila Bend Runway 35, altimeter 29.92. Cleared into STAC. AA is hot
with Devil, appears center of airspace, 15K, NTAC hot with Hog flight, appears to be in eastern
side of the range, low altitude.”). At no time will aircraft be held outside of SUA.
7.4.3.5. Upon recognition of an intruding aircraft, the ROCC radar operator will immediately
advise the effected flight(s) on the respective range frequency. In some cases this may mean
communicating with manned range controllers for their awareness. Maintain intruder awareness
until effected flight acknowledges and deconflicts or when the traffic has passed and is no longer
a factor. Pass traffic information IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. Provide as much
amplifying information as required. (Note: The RADS is uncertified, therefore the terms
approximately will be used when pointing out traffic.)
7.4.3.6. Provide assistance when deemed necessary (for example, an aircraft waiting for NTAC
range period). Communicate that AA is available for holding, request pilot to state his/her
intentions in order to have situational awareness and be able to pass traffic information to other
flights in the vicinity.
7.4.4. The ROCC is an integral part of the 56 FW Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
program. ROCC personnel will reference Luke OPlan 91-1 and http://www.usahas.com/ for
bird conditions and advise flights of conditions upon check-in.
7.4.4.1. The ROCC will coordinate with manned range controllers to ensure information is
passed, up-to-date.
7.4.4.2. Upon initial check-in for MTRs, the ROCC will pass any known bird advisory (for
example, “caution, bird activity reported 5nm west of Point Bravo, 1,000’ AGL”). Conditions
will exist for at least 15 minutes IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, unless subsequent
reports reveal activity no longer a factor. Upon exit pilots will report any significant bird activity
to ROCC personnel in order for that information to be passed to subsequent flights and 56 FW
SOF.
7.4.5. Plot Sonoran pronghorn sightings as reported by ground parties and confirm closed
targets. Advise 56 RMO/ASMS for range NOTAM updates; contact respective SOFs as
appropriate to ensure operations are aware (prior to NOTAM being issued).
7.4.6. The ROCC will coordinate and communicate with respective SOFs, RCOs, GBAFAF
tower, and CBP agents as required. In the event 56 FW flying status changes, (for example,
from VFR to IFR DM) ROCC personnel will contact open manned ranges and pass updated field
status information to ensure flights on range are made aware.
7.4.6.1. For emergency response activation call GBAFAF ECC and advise them of aircraft
crash, ground incident or injury to personnel. The ROCC will assist the on-scene commander as
necessary during an aircraft crash or ground incident. Identify other assets in the vicinity that
 86                                             AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


may be of assistance. Provide information to the SOF and/or respective command posts as
necessary.
7.4.6.2. Communicate with CBP (Ajo and Wellton Stations) upon opening to determine status of
agents and air assets as it pertains to the BMGR East complex.
7.4.6.3. Communicate with Air Marine Operations Center (CBP) with opening and closing of
ROCC. During CBP unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, confirm status of UAV IAW
existing Letter of Procedure.
7.4.7. There will be a dedicated ground/data collection position manned based on the demands
of the flying schedule. The ground position will coordinate with BMGR East radar operator for
ground movement within the ranges.
7.4.7.1. Control access to ranges as appropriate. Cross check schedule to determine land access
ability with respect to weapons hazard area(s).
7.4.7.2. The ground/data position will log/track all ground parties on range. If at the end of the
day there are still ground parties on range, ROCC personnel will advise GBAFAF security.
7.4.7.3. Complete the EOD detonation checklist when appropriate.

      GILA BEND AIR FORCE AUXILIARY FIELD (GBAFAF) PROCEDURES

8.1. General Description. GBAFAF is located 4.7 NM southwest of the Gila Bend VORTAC
32° 53.25‘ N, 112° 43.20‘ W. Airfield elevation is 883‘ MSL. Prior Permission Required
(PPR) approval from 56 RMO/QAE (COR) (DSN 896-5261) must be obtained 24 hours prior to
intended landing. PPR is not required for emergency, diverts or operations in support of
scheduled range missions. Pilots are encouraged to utilize GBAFAF for low approaches,
Simulated Flameout (SFO) and touch-and-go training requirements. GBAFAF is strictly a
day/night VFR facility. The GBAFAF airfield layout is depicted at Figure 8.1.

Figure 8.1. GBAFAF Layout.

8.1.1. Traffic inbound to or overflight of GBAFAF will contact tower as soon as possible for
landing instructions/advisories. Upon initial contact tower will issue landing runway, altimeter
setting, and status of Range 3 when required or requested. Remain clear of Range 3 and ETAC
range to the maximum extent possible.
8.1.2. Gila Bend Class ―D‖ Airspace. Class ―D‖ airspace is defined as a 4.2 NM radius of
GBAFAF airport, excluding that airspace within R-2305 from the surface up to and including
3900‘ MSL. Gila Bend Municipal airport is 4.7 NM northeast of GBAFAF.
8.2. Aircraft Priorities. ATC applies FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control priorities (e.g.,
aircraft in distress, medical evacuation, flight check, etc.), in addition the following priorities are
established for GBAFAF:
8.2.1. Check rides
8.2.2. Syllabus Transition Training (to include night NVG patterns)
8.2.3. Straight-in SFOs
8.2.4. Overhead SFOs
8.2.5. Random entry SFOs
8.2.6. Tactical Arrivals
8.2.7. Parachute Operations
8.2.8. Other traffic
8.3. Operating Hours.
8.3.1. The airfield and tower are open during scheduled BMGR East periods, excluding
holidays, other times by NOTAM
8.3.2. Tower will open 30 minutes prior to the first scheduled range mission or 15 minutes prior
to the first scheduled takeoff at Luke AFB, whichever occurs first.
8.3.3. Requests for services outside these times, to include weekends, will be pre-coordinated
through the 56 RMO/ASMS at DSN 896-7654.
8.3.4. Tower will remain open until 15 minutes after range departure of aircraft operating from
another base, or until all Luke AFB local flying is complete and Luke aircraft have landed
whichever is later. Tower will coordinate with the Luke SOF to determine when Luke AFB
local flying is complete.
8.4. Runway Utilization. RWY 35 is designated as the preferred runway and will be used when
the tailwind component is 10 knots or less.
8.5. Arresting Systems. GBAFAF is configured with E-5 and BAK-12 arresting systems. The
approach end E-5 is disconnected and removed from the under-run. Approach and departure end
BAK-12s (modified with 8-point tie-down system) are connected approximately 1,200‘ from the
threshold at each end. Aircraft arresting system locations are depicted in Figure 8.1.
8.6. Barrier Status. Airfield management in coordination with GBAFAF CE will ensure
procedures are established for the proper maintenance and operation of the arresting systems.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                                89


8.6.1. Barrier maintenance will inspect all arresting systems prior to airfield opening and report
status to airfield management operations.
8.6.2. Recycle time for the E-5 arresting system is normally several hours. Most of the arresting
gear must be replaced and heavy equipment is needed to return the chains to their normal
position.
8.6.3. After release of an aircraft from the cable, the minimum rewind time for the BAK-12 is 3-
1/2 minutes. A minimum of an additional 2-1/2 minutes is required to position the cable
supports. A 20 minute period is required for atmospheric cooling of braking gear. Each BAK-12
at GBAFAF can accommodate three aircraft per hour.
8.7. Airfield Lighting.
8.7.1. The control tower has control of all airfield lighting to include infrared (IR) runway lights.
Exception: obstruction lights are activated by photocell. Lighting configurations at GBAFAF
will be standard, IR, or no-lights based on scheduled mission requirements. See para. 8.16 for
specific NVG operations.
8.7.2. Airfield lighting will be operated in accordance with Table 8.1.

Table 8.1. GBAFAF Lighting.

 *Based on the location of GBAFAF it has been decided the runway lights will be on Step 3 at
 night. Pilots may request a different setting.
 Taxiway Lights: Are operated in conjunction with the runway lights, continuously from sunset
 to sunrise.
 IR Lighting                                    Turn On
                                                Airfield must be scheduled for NVG pattern use
8.7.3. The rotating beacon will be operated according to FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
8.7.4. To support NVG training, IR runway lights are installed to runway 35. IR lights are
visible only to those using night vision devices. IR lights are permanently secured to the ground
via frangible couplings, located 10 feet from runway edge in parallel with existing runway lights
spaced 1000 feet apart. Airfield markings for NVG operations include AMP-3 and AMP-4,
described in AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.
8.7.5. Unlit obstructions. (Caution: Pilots landing under normal conditions will not see IR
light fixtures and pilots aided by NVGs will not see standard lighting fixtures. Under normal
NVG operations, the rotating beacon will be turned off.)

8.7.6. GBAFAF is a VFR only facility. Operation of airfield lighting during periods of reduced
visibility will be at pilot‘s request.
8.8. Control of Ground Traffic and Vehicle Operations.
8.8.1. Pilots will monitor GBAFAF ground control frequency during engine start and taxi. IAW
stop alert procedures pilots will advise tower prior to engine start. Pilots shall read back all hold
short instructions.
8.8.2. The Airfield Manager will notify all section managers with airfield drivers of any
scheduled construction activity and/or airfield closures (e.g., runways, taxiway, etc.) and when
the construction activity is complete and area is back open.
8.8.3. Tower responsibility for control of vehicular traffic on the aerodrome will be limited to
those in the controlled movement area (Figure 8.2).
8.8.4. Vehicles having access to the airport movement area will have two-way radio
communications with the control tower, and the radio will be monitored at all times. Radio
approval from the tower is required before vehicles proceed closer than 250‘ from the runway.
8.8.4.1. Deployed unit operations on the helo pads (for example the Western Army Aviation
Training forward deployed operations). This area is considered a controlled movement area
however in consideration for unit operations; the first vehicle into the area will gain tower
approval for continued operations throughout the flying window, and call out when flying
operations are complete for the day. This allowance only applies to those units operating from
the helo pads on an extended basis. Under this condition helicopter landing will be at pilot
discretion/risk due to uncontrolled movement in the area.
8.8.5. In the event two-way radio contact is lost between the tower and vehicles on, or near the
runway, the tower will turn the runway and taxiway lights on and off rapidly for a period of not
less than 30 seconds. This signals all vehicles that are on, or near the runway, to depart or
immediately withdraw to a point at least 150‘ from the runway. Tower will also, time
permitting, transmit a flashing red light gun signal to the vehicles on the runway. Any time
vehicle operators experience actual, or suspected, loss of two-way radio contact with the tower
they will exit the runway or taxiway immediately.
8.8.6. When necessary, the tower will suspend runway operations temporarily to allow airfield
operations, fire department personnel, or civil engineers to inspect the arresting systems or
perform maintenance.

Figure 8.2. GBAFAF Controlled Movement Area.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                             91




8.8.7. A designated airfield representative will inspect the runway as soon as practical following
any emergency.
8.8.8. Engine Runs.
8.8.8.1. In accordance with stop alert procedures, crew chiefs will inform airfield management
operations of any impending engine run-up.
8.8.8.2. Airfield management operations will notify the tower, transient alert, and the fire
department of the engine- run-up.

8.8.8.3. Personnel performing engine run-ups will establish radio contact with the tower before
the run-up begins, and will continue to monitor ground frequency throughout the run-up. The
run-up will be terminated if tower personnel so direct.
8.9. Traffic Patterns. (Figure 8.3)
8.9.1. Except for emergency or divert situations, the maximum traffic density is four (4) aircraft
with similar ground speeds (F-16 and F-16; A-10 and A-10; A-10 and C-130). Exception: only
2 x C-130s allowed at one time. Number of aircraft in the pattern is limited due to control tower
manning.
8.9.2. All aircraft remain clear of restricted airspace.
8.9.3. VFR traffic pattern is 2,400 MSL and 300 KIAS with normal breaks to the west. (Normal
initial is 3 NM). Tactical initial/arrival is allowed to RWY 35, 350 KIAS maximum.
8.9.4. Low closed traffic pattern (to simulate a circling approach) altitude is 1,700‘ MSL.
8.9.5. Straight-in and conventional pattern altitude is 1,900 MSL.
8.9.6. Breakout altitude is 2,900 MSL.
8.9.7. Straight-in approaches to RWY 17 authorized only for emergency/divert aircraft.
8.9.8. Night VFR/NVG pattern downwind is 3900 feet MSL. Refer to Figure 8.6 for pattern
depiction.
8.9.9. Helicopter pattern altitude, 1,400‘ MSL.

8.10. Overhead/Rectangular Pattern Entry Procedures.
8.10.1. Outside BMGR East. Pilots will contact Luke Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) for
service enroute to GBAFAF. Avoid the ARLIN Intersection (LUF 215/24; GBN 344/22; BXK
131/12) and vicinity between 12,000 MSL and FL 180 enroute to Woolsey Peak (LUF 216/34;
GBN 307/17; or BXK 176/17). Avoid overflight of the town of Gila Bend and the Gila Bend
Municipal Airport.
8.10.2. Inside BMGR East. Avoid and/or deconflict range subsections. Normal points of exit
are ARSON, COOLY (Black Gap), and BUGGS. Contact GBAFAF tower NLT 10 NM from
the field, stating number in flight and intentions.
 94                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


8.10.3. Re-entry Procedures. Turn westerly climbing to 2,400 MSL and 300 knots to intercept
normal flow of traffic abeam AUX-6 (GBN 227/8.5) or as directed and enter a 3-mile initial or
request a straight-in (Runway 35).
8.11. Tactical Initial. Tactical initial will be flown to runway 35 only, 350 KIAS maximum.
Pilots will give an accurate position report NLT 13NM and proceed to 5NM tactical initial. Be
prepared to breakout if Range 3 becomes active. Remain east of highway 85. Report 5NM
tactical initial and proceed overhead.
8.12. Tactical Arrival. Tactical arrival will be flown to runway 35 only, 350 KIAS maximum.
Pilots will give an accurate position report NLT 10 NM and proceed to Black Gap. Remain clear
of Range 3 unless status confirmed and transit approved by tower. Report Black Gap between
8000‘ – 11,000‘ MSL and proceed to 3NM tactical arrival between 3,000‘ – 8,000‘ MSL. Report
3NM tactical arrival and proceed to overhead. Report base position at 2,400‘ MSL.
8.13. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Procedures.
8.13.1. SFOs will be conducted in VMC between sunrise and sunset when GBAFAF weather is
at least 1,000 above high key altitude and five miles visibility.
8.13.2. Contact GBAFAF tower with SFO request when below 18,000 MSL and able to
maintain VMC.
8.13.3. SFO/Range 3 traffic deconfliction. Use extreme caution to remain clear of Range 3
operations while inbound to the SFO pattern.
8.13.4. Overhead (High Key) SFOs.
8.13.5. SFOs may be practiced to Runway 17 or 35 (left or right hand turns). Entry may be from
any position with tower approval. Pilots in the SFO pattern will remain south of Interstate 8.
Maximum SFO High Key altitude is 12,000‘ MSL. Normal overhead SFO windows are as
follows: High Key 8000‘ – 12,000‘ MSL, Low Key 4,000‘ – 6,000‘ MSL, Base Key 3,000‘
MSL. See Figure 8.3 GBAFAF traffic pattern for depiction.
8.13.6. Straight-In SFOs.
8.13.6.1. Straight-in SFOs will be flown to runway 35 only. Upon initial contact with the
control tower the pilot will report his position and altitude and request the straight-in SFO.
(Note: Initial contact must be made prior to entering Range 3 airspace and allow sufficient time
for the tower controller to coordinate with Snakeye.)
8.13.6.2. Tower will determine Range 3 status with Snakeye prior to straight-in approval. If
Range 3 is hot, the straight-in SFO will be denied. If Range 3 is cold, the pilot will be instructed
to report 10 NM and 5 NM.
8.13.6.3. In the event aircraft check-in with Snakeye for Range 3 the following applies:
Snakeye will contact tower to discontinue any SFO greater than 10 NM on final. Tower will
direct SFO traffic to discontinue straight-in SFO and report GBAFAF at 12,000 MSL. Use
caution for other aircraft holding high key.
8.13.6.4. Report 5 NM with the gear.
8.13.6.5. When the straight-in SFO reaches 5 NM, other aircraft in the pattern will be directed as
follows: Aircraft at high key will be instructed to hold at high key. Aircraft on initial will be
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                              95


directed to carry straight through. The break/pitch-out will be extended for sequencing behind
the straight-in SFO aircraft.
8.13.7. Random Entry SFOs.
8.13.7.1. Random entry SFO assumes the pilot is not in a position to either make high key or a
true straight-in entry. Its imperative pilots give an accurate position report and intentions
(normally random entry SFOs proceed direct to low or base key). Random entry SFOs can be
flown to either runway. Tower will provide position report requirements.
8.13.7.2. If outside restricted airspace remain south of I-8 and avoid restricted airspace en-route
to GBAFAF. If approaching from inside restricted airspace, remain clear of Range 3 unless
status confirmed and transit approved by tower.
8.13.7.3. Pilots executing a random entry SFO are expected to funnel through the following
areas: 10 NM west (north of R2301-E); 10 NM southwest (if entry is from Range
4/NTAC/STAC); 10 NM south (entry from Range 1/2); 10 NM southeast (entry from ETAC);
10 NM east (north of R2304). Use caution for VFR traffic north of BMGR East Complex and
other military traffic IVO BUGGS, COOLY (Black Gap), NOLLS.
8.13.8. Straight-in/Random SFO Controller Checkout. Initial controller checkout/training will
be accomplished in the following manner:
8.13.8.1. Academics (taught by chief tower controller and 56 RMO designated instructor pilot.)
8.13.8.2. DASH 1 SFO pattern procedures, potential traffic conflicts, breakout procedures, cut
off points, and hand-off procedures.
8.13.8.3. Controller SFO Certification.
8.13.8.3.1. To the extent possible, an experienced Instructor Pilot/FCP pilot will fly patterns for
controller certification.
8.13.8.3.2. Traffic pattern will be sanitized to minimize conflicts during certifications.
8.13.8.3.3. Chief tower controller at GBAFAF will checkout controllers using ―watch one,
control one.‖
8.13.8.3.4. Certification will be documented in applicable training records.
8.14. GBAFAF Departures. Departures from GBAFAF will be VFR. (Note: pilots are
expected to file a VFR or IFR flight plan prior to takeoff.) File the flight plan with GBAFAF
airfield management operations or respective base operations at least 30 minutes prior to
departure. Obtain flight clearance once airborne from either Luke Approach or Albuquerque
Center.
8.14.1. RWY 17 and 35 departures are to cross the departure end of runway at or below 1,900‘
MSL.
8.14.2. Intersection departures are not authorized for attack or fighter aircraft. For aircraft
requesting RWY 35 intersection departures, there is 6,700‘ available.
8.14.3. Fighter type aircraft staging out of GBAFAF (flying directly into BMGR East), will
follow departure routing as depicted in Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5.

8.15. Helicopter Operations.
8.15.1. GBAFAF helipads (Figure 8.1). The six helipads are designed under limited use VFR
criteria and are used to accommodate tactical helicopter operations. Cargo helicopters may use
helipad area on pre-coordinated case by case basis. Units forward deploying to GBAFAF will
stage at Helipads to max extent possible.
8.15.2. The helipads are not lighted for night time use however deployed units are allowed to
operate at night with their own tactical lighting scheme with written agreement between
56 RMO/GBAFAF/AM and user, letter template is in Attachment 16. (Note: takeoff and
landing will be at own risk under tower advisement.)
8.15.3. The helipad area is considered a FOD free area per 56FW/CV waiver (3 Mar 11)
meaning access FOD checks are not required. AFM will conduct FOD checks daily and sweep
as required. Ground crews will be cognizant of FOD.
 98                                              AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012


8.15.4. Skid type helicopters are authorized direct access to the ramp for landing and takeoff.
Landing gear equipped helicopters will use the main runway, or helipads for landing and takeoff.
8.15.3. Armed helicopters must use helipads or approved portions of the main ramp.
8.15.4. Arrival and departure routes will be flown so as to avoid overflight of aircraft, the base
or any other populated area. Every caution should be made to minimize FOD potential on the
runway, taxiway, and ramp area. A FOD check should be accomplished following any
helicopter runway landing.
8.16. Reduced Runway Separation.
8.16.1. GBAFAF, IAW AFI 13-203/AETC Sup 1, Air Traffic Control, Attachment 15, tower
controllers may apply the following reduced runway separation (RRS) criteria.
8.16.2. Similar Fighter Type Aircraft Operations (F-16 to F-16).
8.16.3. Full stop (FS) behind FS, touch-and-go (TG), or low approach (LA): 3,000‘.
8.16.4. TG behind TG or LA: 3,000‘.
8.16.5. LA behind TG or FS: 6,000‘.
8.16.6. TG behind a FS: 6,000‘.
8.16.7. Night or wet runway operations: 6,000‘.
8.16.8. Formation landings, provided all aircraft involved are the same type aircraft: 6,000‘.

Table 8.2. RRS for Similar Type Airframe (F-16 to F-16, A-10 to A-10).

                                 Full Stop              Low Approach         Touch and Go
 Full Stop Behind                3,000‘                 3,000‘               3,000‘
 Low Approach Behind             6,000‘                 3,000‘               6,000‘
 Touch and Go Behind             6,000‘                 3,000‘               3,000‘
8.16.9. For all other fighter and trainer type aircraft (not the same airframe) operations (F-16 to
A-10 or F-16 to F-18) full runway separation is required.
8.16.10. RRS will not be applied when the following conditions exist:
8.16.10.1. When aircraft are cleared for the option;
8.16.10.2. When the tower determines safety of aircraft will be jeopardized;
8.16.10.3. Any situation involving an emergency aircraft;
8.16.10.4. When pilot reports braking action of fair or less are reported.
8.16.11. It is a pilot‘s responsibility to accept or reject RRS. Pilots must inform tower as soon
as possible that RRS cannot be accepted so that traffic sequencing can be adjusted as necessary.
Aircraft will not over fly landing aircraft. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to landing aircraft.
8.16.12. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
separation.
AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                               99


8.17. Drop Zone (DZ) Operations. All BMGR East published DZs affect GBAFAF Class D
airspace. When DZ operations are scheduled, dates and times will be posted in appropriate
NOTAMs. 56 RMO/ASM will coordinate use with Albuquerque Center and Luke RAPCON.
8.17.1. Drops may be made within a 5 NM radius of the DZ from surface to 17,500 MSL.
Avoid flight within this area during parachute operations unless an emergency situation exists.
Drop aircraft will be in contact with GBAFAF tower during all DZ operations. GBAFAF tower
holds the right to hold drop operations based on other circumstances for example an emergency
inbound. GBAFAF tower and Snakeye will issue advisories to all flights. SFO and syllabus
training have priority over DZ operations at Meatloaf DZ (GBAFAF). See Chapter 2, para 2.5
for DZ specifics.
8.18. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations
8.18.1. General: NVG operations are an integral part of today‘s tactical employment. NVG
airfield operations are conducted using IR runway lights or no runway/taxiway lighting. Aircraft
will keep overt lighting on at all times. Emergency traffic always takes priority. Expect
incandescent airfield lighting for all emergencies.
8.18.2. For pilots requesting a single approach, runway lights may be turned off based on other
pattern traffic.
8.18.3. Scheduling Procedures:
8.18.3.1. Due to pattern/airspace requirements, C-130 and extensive fighter NVG takeoff and
landing operations will be scheduled through 56 RMO/ASMS in coordination with GBAFAF
airfield management operations a minimum of one week in advance of proposed operations.

AFI13-212_LUKEAFBSUP 30 MARCH 2012                                                            101


8.18.9.2. Unless an emergency exists, the tower will not mix non-participating aircraft with
NVG aircraft on the ground or in the air.
8.18.9.3. Cut-off for returning to normal lighting. Due to the proximity of BMGR East, lead
time for emergency inbounds may be limited. At the first notification of an emergency inbound,
tower will notify aircraft in the pattern and turn on normal airfield lighting. Pilots may request
normal lighting at any time.
8.18.10. Vehicle Operations: Vehicle operations not in support of NVG operations will be kept
to a minimum during periods of reduced airfield lighting. Only vehicles in direct support of
NVG aircraft ground operations will be allowed on the main ramp. Vehicles with normal
lighting (headlights), unless in direct support of NVG operations, shall remain clear of the
controlled movement area environment (exception: GBAFAF security will be on the ramp any
time an aircraft is present.) IAW AFI 13-213 vehicles operating during NVG operations, must
use hazard warning flashers or an infrared (IR) strobe on vehicle‘s roof.
8.18.10.1. Designated Vehicle Routes. All vehicles will remain on main access roads, ramp
areas, and or the edges of the taxiway or runway unless conditions warrant otherwise. All
vehicle access must be coordinated through tower.
8.18.11. Termination/Restart Procedures. NVG operations when scheduled will have priority
over non-participating operations for the duration of the NVG operations. Any flight safety
deviation or unauthorized encroachment onto the taxiways or runway will result in ceasing all
NVG operations, lights being turned on, and notification to airfield management operations.
Upon conflict resolution, NVG operations may resume with coordination between the tower,
airfield management operations, and NVG aircraft.
8.18.12. Upon completion of NVG operations, the tower will resume normal airfield lighting.
8.19. GBAFAF Emergency Procedures

scenario involving the employment of ordnance (air/surface/sea) including Mission Essential
Personnel and those personnel not required for ordnance employment including maneuver
elements, opposition forces, instructors, evaluators, etc.
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)—The detection, identification, on-site evaluation,
rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal or unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also
include explosive ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.
Guard—A radio frequency that is normally used for emergency transmissions and is
continuously monitored. UHF band: 243.0 MHZ; VHF band: 121.5 MHZ.
Hazard Areas—The Hazard Area is a composite of all WDZs and surface danger zones (SDZs)
for all authorized weapon delivery events against targets or DMPIs approved for actual ordnance

expenditures. Public access to Hazard Areas is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the
ROA.
Impact Areas—The Impact Area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the target(s)
or designated mean point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance delivery. Public access to
Impact Areas is prohibited at all times. Access to Impact Areas when the range is inactive will be
limited to Essential Personnel.
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)—Rules governing the procedures for conducting instrument
flight. Also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of flight plan.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms
of visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling; less than minimums specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)—An individual qualified IAW JP3-09.3 to provide
terminal control for the delivery of weapons by aircraft.
Large Force Exercise (LFE)—Training where more than 10 aircraft are operating in the
assigned airspace.
Low- \Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area—Usually large geographic areas established
for random VFR, low altitude navigation training.
Military Operations Area (MOA)—Airspace designated for nonhazardous military activity,
established outside the Class A airspace (below 18,000 feet MSL) and within US territorial
airspace.
Military Training Route (MTR)—A low-level, high-speed training route established IAW
criteria in FAA Joint Order 7610.4, Special Operations. MTRs are used by DoD to conduct low
altitude navigation and tactical training, in instrument and visual weather conditions, below an
altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and at airspeeds more than 250 KIAS. Routes are established as IFR
routes (IR) or VFR routes (VR). The FAA has approval authority to implement IRs and the
appropriate MAJCOM approves VR implementation. Environmental documentation is required
for implementation IAW AFI 32-7061. VRs are processed through the FAA via the AFREP.
MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FAA Sectionals and DoD Low IFR charts.
AFREPs assign all route numbers.
Mission Essential Personnel—Those personnel on a range directly required for the employment
of ordnance (air/surface/sea) in a test, training or evaluation scenario. This may include JTACs,
TACPs, range control officers, scorers, and any other personnel identified as required by the
ROA.
Night Vision Device (NVD)—Any electro-optical device that is used to detect visible and
infrared energy and provide a visible image. Night vision goggles, forward-looking infrared,
thermal sights, and low-light level television are night vision devices.
Night Vision Goggles(s) (NVG)—An electro-optical image intensifying device that detects
visible and near-infrared energy, intensifies the energy, and provides a visible image for night
viewing. Night vision goggles can be either hand-held or helmet-mounted.

Notice to Airman (NOTAM)—A notice containing information concerning the establishment,
condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard, the timely
knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
Range Control Officer (RCO)—The person responsible for range operations and safety. Except
in situations where the RCO delegates weapons release clearance to a qualified flight lead,
individual pilot or Forward Air Controller, or other briefed person.
Special Instructions (SPINS)—Restrictions, procedures, and scenario elements applicable to
specific scenarios, missions, or exercise.
Special Use Airspace (SUA)—Airspace of defined vertical and lateral dimensions wherein
activities are confined. Certain limitations or restrictions may be imposed on non-participating
aircraft. Except for Controlled Firing Areas, SUA is depicted on aeronautical charts.
Supervisor of Flying (SOF)—A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to
monitor and supervise current flight operations. A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties from
the control tower.
Surface Danger Zones (SDZ)—The ground and airspace designated for vertical and lateral
containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components
resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation of weapon systems to include explosives and
demolitions.
Visual Flight Rules (VFR)—Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under visual
conditions. The term ―VFR‖ is also used in the United States to indicate weather conditions that
are equal to or greater than minimum VFR requirements. In addition, it is used by pilots and
controllers to indicate type of flight plan.
Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)—Weather conditions in which visual flight rules
apply; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds along
the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions prevail
and instrument flight rules must be complied with.
Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ)—The ground and airspace for lateral and vertical containment
of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from
the firing, launching, and/or detonation of aviation delivered ordnance. This three-dimensional
zone accounts for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, and broaches (resurfacing) of a specific
weapon/munitions type delivered by a specific aircraft type. Where software selectable, this
instruction requires 99.9999% containment for surface fires (expressed as 1:1,000,000
escapement for SDZs), 99.999% containment for aviation-delivered gun ammunition, and
99.99% containment for all other aviation-delivered ordnance.
