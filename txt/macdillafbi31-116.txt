                                   DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Operating a motor vehicle on MacDill AFB is a privilege, not a right. The use of a valid
state, international, or foreign driver’s license is acceptable for operating a privately owned
motor vehicle on MacDill AFB. Anyone who operates a vehicle on MacDill AFB impliedly
consents to provide a sample of their blood, breath or urine for testing if suspected of driving
while impaired by alcohol or drugs. All personnel operating a vehicle on MacDill AFB will
ensure their vehicle is properly ensured, registered and in safe operating condition. They also
agree to comply with all traffic rules of the installation.
2.2. Inspections of vehicles at MacDill AFB entry gates and restricted areas are conducted
in accordance with command policy and force protection measures to insure the health and
safety of military personnel, protect military property, and secure national security
interests. Individuals entering the installation are deemed to have impliedly consented to
compliance with applicable regulations and rules governing MacDill AFB, including but not
limited to consent to random vehicle inspections, as directed by the commander, 6 AMW/CC. If
an individual refuses to submit to an inspection of his or her vehicle, the following actions will
be completed:
   2.2.1. If the owner/operator is civilian, ask him/her for identification and advise the
   vehicleoperator they cannot enter the base unless the vehicle is examined. If they refuse to
   have the vehicle examined, advise the operator/owner failure to submit to a Base Entry Point
   Check (BEPC) will result in revocation of base driving privileges, base barment actions, or
   both. If the owner/operator still refuses, Security Forces personnel will conduct a visual
   inspection of the exterior of the vehicle to ensure there is no overt risk to safety or security.
   If evidence of criminal activity is detected in plain sight during an inspection, Security
   Forces personnel will alert Security Forces chain of command and promptly consult the on-
   call 6 AMW/JA for further guidance. If the operator attempts to enter the installation, deny
   entry. If the BEPC is for outbound vehicles and the operator refuses the inspection the same
   procedures apply. The operator will be detained and further guidance will be requested
   through the 6 SFS chain of command and the on-call 6 AMW/JA.

        Advocate (SJA) to determine if enough probable cause exists to obtain authority to search
        and seize from the military magistrate.
2.3. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
     2.3.1. The Traffic Violations Review Authority (TVRA) has the authority to suspend,
     revoke, or restrict the privilege of operating a motor vehicle/vessel on MacDill AFB. This

     privately owned vehicle (POV) while their state license is suspended/revoked, on-duty
     Security Forces personnel will issue immediate notices of suspension of base driving
     privileges. Personnel apprehended or detained for impaired/intoxicated driving on or off base
     will have their on base driving privileges immediately suspended/revoked for a period of

     period” to request an administrative hearing once a notice of suspension of base driving
     privileges has been issued is 14 calendar days. This suspension takes affect at the time of the
     vehicle stop. Note: If the individual stopped does not have an affiliation with MacDill
     AFB or any other DoD installation they will still be issued the suspension/revocation of
     base driving privilege letter but they will not have the right to an Administrative Hearing.
     These cases will be settled through the Magistrate Court System. If an individual is
     requesting limited driving privileges for a 30 day suspension resulting from the accumulation
     of traffic points or another incident not related to DUI/BUI or a suspended/revoked license,
     the suspension will not take effect until after the TVRA has reviewed the case and made a
     decision to the individuals appeal.

area, (i.e., Base Exchange, commissary, hobby shop, dormitories, or base housing, etc.), or any
vehicle for which the owner cannot be identified or has permanently departed the immediate
vicinity of MacDill AFB. These vehicles will be considered abandoned by the owner until
determined otherwise. If a vehicle is deemed abandoned the vehicle will be removed from the
installation at the owners expense.
6.4. A vehicle that meets the above mentioned criteria will be cited by Security Forces
personnel utilizing a DD Form 1408, and a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice,
simultaneously.
6.5. If the vehicle has not been removed within 72 hours, a DD Form 2506, Vehicle
Impoundment Report, will be accomplished and an off-base towing company will be notified
to remove the vehicle. Upon arrival of the towing company, a blotter entry will be
accomplished and the vehicle will be removed from the installation. The towing company is
responsible for following Florida Statutes 715.07, Vehicles Parked on Private Property; Towing,
and Florida Statutes 715.109, Sale or Disposition of Abandoned Property, to locate the owner
and/or dispose of the vehicle. In the event a vehicle is determined by the 6 SFS/CC to be a
hazard or force protection concern, it may be immediately removed from the installation using an
off-base towing company.
6.6. The registered owner of the vehicle is responsible to the towing company for any and
all charges associated with the expense of towing the vehicle.

MACDILLAFBI31-116 6 JUNE 2013                                                                 39

  A2.7.4. Implied Consent to Test. Any person who operates a motor vehicle on MacDill
  AFB gives consent to a test or tests of his blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substance for

  intoxicating liquor or drugs. A refusal to submit to the test will result in an automatic
  suspension of driving privileges for 12 months to run in succession to any other suspension
  the individual receives.
  A2.7.5. Driving Under the Influence (Liquor, Drug, Toxic Vapor or Combination Thereof).
  It is unlawful for any person to drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle on
  MacDill AFB while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, a vapor releasing

  A2.7.7. Reckless Driving. No person will drive any vehicle with a culpable disregard of
  foreseeable consequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness is not
  determined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion of the rights of
  another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erratic operation, but all these factors may
  be admissible and relevant as bearing upon the ultimate question: whether, under all the
  circumstances, the operator’s manner of operation or physical control of the vehicle was that
  heedless nature which made it actually or imminently dangerous to the occupants or the
  rights or safety of others. It is operating or physical control of the vehicle with such a high
  degree of negligence that if death were caused, the operator or individual in physical control
  would have committed involuntary manslaughter, at least.

  pursuing a vehicle may be by hand, voice, emergency light, or siren. The Security Forces
  member giving the signal must be on duty. If the Security Forces member is in a vehicle, the
  vehicle must be appropriately marked as a Security Forces vehicle.
