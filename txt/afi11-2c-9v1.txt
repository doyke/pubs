Notes:
   1. Operations group commanders may waive MAJCOM-directed flying continuation training
       requirements in this regulation for individual aircrew members.
   2. HQ AFRC/DOTA is the waiver authority for the secondary method of training.
   1.2.6. Aircrew members whose status is "duty not including flying (DNIF)" may log ground training
   events, including simulator, if the member’s physical condition allows it. The flight surgeon who
   signs the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
   placing the aircrew member DNIF, should be consulted if the aircrew member’s ability to complete
   training is in question.
   1.2.7. Aircrew members performing extended alert duty (more than 72 hours) may accomplish any
   type of ground training, during normal duty hours, that does not degrade required response time or
   mission accomplishment.

1.3. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.3.1. Each training mission must be structured to achieve optimum training. Any by-product airlift
   opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training in any way and must com-
   ply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) instructions. Any use of flying training hours to
   accomplish other than direct training requirements must be approved by the appropriate numbered Air
   Force commander. It is essential that personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility
   resources as well as the perception of their misuse. The approval authority for Off-Station Training
   Flights is the Wing Commander.
   1.3.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by weapon sys-
   tem operating procedures or specific theater operations order, the operations group commander or
   AFRC equivalent may allow upgrade or special qualification training on operational missions. Com-
   manders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the aircrew member receiv-
   ing training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty. In addition, IAW AFI 11-401,
   Flight Management, unqualified pilots are not authorized access to the controls with passengers on
   board.

1.4. Responsibilities. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines responsibilities for aircrew training.
   1.4.1. AMC Headquarters. As lead command MAJCOM for the C-9 as specified in AFPD 11-2 and
   AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command Weapon Systems Management, AMC is responsible for stan-
8                                                                    AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

    dardizing aircrew flying training requirements in coordination with other user MAJCOMs. HQ AMC
    is responsible for training course requirements, training tasks, and quota control in coordination with
    other headquarters as follows:
       1.4.1.1. Courses. The AMC Director of Operations (DO), in coordination with other MAJCOMs,
       approves courses. Send proposals for amending existing course prerequisites or deleting obsolete
       courses through the appropriate headquarters to HQ AMC/DOT for approval. HQ AMC/DOT
       will process the approved changes in coordination with the AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal
       Schools, office of primary responsibility (OPR).
       1.4.1.2. Formal Course Review. HQ AMC/DOT will host a Command Curriculum Review
       Workshop (CCRW) biennially, or more frequently as required. Attendees should include training
       representatives from HQ AMC/DOT/DOV/SG, AMWC/WCOX, ACC, AETC, AFRC, ANG,
       PACAF, USAFE, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), curriculum developers, for-
       mal schools, numbered Air Force (NAF) training and standardization offices, selected unit repre-
       sentatives, and ATS contractors.
       1.4.1.3. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). HQ AMC/DOT is responsible for the PFT accord-
       ing to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. AMC units will send projected PFT requirements to HQ AMC/
       DOT. Other units will send projected PFT requirements to HQ AMC/DOT through their parent
       MAJCOMs.
    1.4.2. Other MAJCOMs. MAJCOMs will provide policy and guidance in order for units to develop
    their respective training programs. MAJCOM unique training requirements will be forwarded by the
    MAJCOM to HQ AMC/DOT as necessary.
       1.4.2.1. Supplements. MAJCOMs may supplement this instruction as outlined in AFI 11-202,
       Volume 1. MAJCOMs will forward proposed supplements to HQ AMC/DOT and AF/XOOT for
       approval before publication, and send two copies to HQ AMC/DOT and one copy to HQ USAF/
       XOOT after publication.
    1.4.3. Operations Groups. The operations group will convene a training review panel (TRP). The
    operations group will determine frequency, format and content of the meetings. The TRP should
    review staff and aircrew management actions necessary to complete the squadrons’ flight and ground
    training programs.
       1.4.3.1. The operations group will establish procedures with the servicing military personnel
       flight (MPF) for individual counseling and personnel system updates for the active duty service
       commitment (ADSC) incurred (if applicable). Refer to AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Com-
       mitments (ADSC) and Specialized Period of Time Contracts (SPTC), and AFCAT 36-2223.
       1.4.3.2. The operations group, in coordination with the flying squadrons, will determine the func-
       tions and responsibilities of the operations support squadron (OSS) training flight. Any flight
       commander training functions other than formal schoolhouse instructor stipulated in this volume
       may also be performed by appropriate OSS training flight personnel.
       1.4.3.3. Progress Review (PR). If at any time during a trainee’s flight instruction, (ATS ground
       instruction, see paragraph 6.5.), progress is considered unsatisfactory by the formal schoolhouse,
       the training squadron will notify the responsible unit training manager. On receiving documenta-
       tion and recommendations from the formal schoolhouse, the responsible unit will convene a
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                             9

     Progress Review to review the trainee’s record and determine whether to continue, modify, termi-
     nate training, or conduct a Flight Evaluation Board.
  1.4.4. Squadrons. As a general rule, training management is at the squadron or flight level; however,
  the wing or operations group commander is ultimately responsible for squadron training programs.
     1.4.4.1. Squadron commanders (AFRC: appropriate Operations Supervisor) will ensure aircrew
     members complete training in a timely manner. Failure to reasonably progress mandates action
     for removal if appropriate.
         1.4.4.1.1. Ensure formal school post-graduate questionnaires are accomplished and returned
         to the formal schools. A copy of the questionnaire answer form will be retained by the gaining
         squadron for one year after completion of formal school training.
         1.4.4.1.2. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached air-
         crew members. Unit commanders or appropriate AFRC Operations supervisors may assign
         additional requirements based on individual aircrew member's experience and proficiency.
         1.4.4.1.3. Review training and evaluation records of newly assigned aircrew members and
         those completing formal training, to determine the training required to certify them as Basic
         Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR). Assign
         training levels and levels of supervision to other aircrew members, unless specifically directed
         by this instruction, to assigned and attached aircrew members as appropriate. Refer to Chap-
         ter 4 of this instruction for further guidance.
         1.4.4.1.4. Orient mission training scenarios to conditions anticipated in the unit mission.
         Apply operational risk management (ORM) when developing, planning, and executing train-
         ing missions.
         1.4.4.1.5. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for flight surgeons (FS).
         1.4.4.1.6. Coordinate with the wing and/or group in developing training programs.
         1.4.4.1.7. Operations Officers and Flight Commanders (AFRC: Appropriate Operations
         Supervisor) will review open training folders according to paragraph A3.3. (Attachment 3).
     1.4.4.2. Instructor Responsibilities.
         1.4.4.2.1. Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for flight conduct and aircraft safety.
         Should the trainee's judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a question in the instructor's
         mind as to the trainee's ability to safely complete a prescribed maneuver at any time during the
         flight, the instructor will immediately take over the aircraft controls. The instructor will then
         explain and demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the trainee
         resuming control of the aircraft. All instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for
         positively identifying emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.
         1.4.4.2.2. Instructors are responsible for providing thorough ground training, preflight/post-
         flight briefings and critiques. Instructors will comply with requirements of ground training or
         mission outlines, as appropriate, for the type mission being flown.
         1.4.4.2.3. Instructors will review each trainee's training records, to include records of evalua-
         tion, if applicable, prior to each training flight or session.
10                                                                      AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

            1.4.4.2.4. Instructors will ensure all required training items are completed and signed accord-
            ing to Attachment 3 of this volume. Instructors should further ensure the chief of training,
            flight commander or designated representative, are apprised of the trainee’s status.
     1.4.5. Formal School-ATS Contractor. The C-9 Aircrew Training System (ATS) contractor is respon-
     sible for academic and simulator in accordance with the simulator contract. The syllabus will be
     reviewed annually and updated as required according to contractual agreement.
     1.4.6. Formal School-Non-ATS. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 establishes requirements. The MAJCOM
     training division is approval authority for MAJCOM taught courseware. Coordinate with HQ AMC/
     DOTA to incorporate MAJCOM developed courseware into the AFCAT and the ATS when applica-
     ble. Units should refer to AFI 36-2201, Developing, Managing, and Conducting Training, AFPAM
     36-2211, Guide for Management of Air Force Training Systems, and AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional
     System Development, when building AFCAT courses.
        1.4.6.1. The formal school (375 OSS/OSF) will act as the focal point for proposed formal school
        syllabus change requests.
     1.4.7. Intercommand Transfer of Aircrews and Foreign Exchange Officers. The gaining organization
     will honor validated pre-transfer training and use this to determine the appropriate training phase
     where the newly assigned aircrew member is placed.
        1.4.7.1. Consider aircrew personnel qualified throughout the force in the C-9 (AMC, USAFE,
        PACAF, AFRC, and DRUs) when used for the same mission. Complete differences training for a
        change in aircraft series. For intercommand transfers and exchange officers, instructor training
        and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining unit commander. These per-
        sonnel must be transferring to the same weapons system. Intertheater and intercommand transfers
        require theater indoctrination training.
        1.4.7.2. Foreign exchange officers should arrive at the duty station with a current physical and
        qualified in the C-9 and the altitude chamber. Mission qualification training should also have been
        completed. Exchange officers arriving from the formal school will complete local proficiency fly-
        ing, tactical orientation and the following ground training events: Life Support Equipment; Aero-
        medical Rigging; Initial CRM; marshaling exam; tactics; and Theater Indoctrination. Those who
        arrive "qualified" from their country will complete the instrument refresher course (IRC), instru-
        ment written test, simulator refresher qualification, open and closed book examinations, compos-
        ite evaluation, difference training, and local proficiency and tactical flying orientation. They will
        also complete an altitude chamber and physical if proper documentation cannot be produced.

1.5. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Aircrew members entered in an in-unit training program lead-
ing to qualification or re-qualification should be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. In-unit
training should begin no later than 45 days (90 days AFRC) after reporting or being attached to a new
duty station or unit. MAJCOM waiver is required for in-unit training that begins prior to reporting date
(see Table 1.2. for specific time limitations).
     1.5.1. Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly contribut-
     ing to qualification and upgrade: Computer-based training (CBT) lesson, ground training, flight, etc.),
     or 45 days after being attached or assigned to the unit after completion of the formal school, which-
     ever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). Training time limits for in-unit qualifica-
     tion/requalification, local orientation/theater indoctrination, difference training may run concurrently.
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                              11

   1.5.2. Units will notify the MAJCOM training division through channels when aircrew members
   exceed training time limits. (Use the waiver format shown in Section 1.2.) Squadron commanders
   may extend upgrade training time up to 60 days. Extensions in excess of 60 days require MAJCOM/
   DO approval (not applicable to AFRC). An extension of training time letter, signed by the unit com-
   mander, will state the training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and
   estimated completion date.

1.6. Recurrency Training.
   1.6.1. For loss of currency up to 6 months, an aircrew member must demonstrate proficiency with an
   instructor in all delinquent items.
   1.6.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. The individual is unqualified in the aircraft and must
   complete requalification as directed in paragraph 1.7.

1.7. Requalification Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies requalification training limits and
requirements. When completion of the requalification academic course is required but not practical, or
quotas are not available, units will request waivers from HQ AMC/DOT

1.8. Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies ADSC requirements.

1.9. AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, Management. See Attachment 3.

        volume.
        1.11.2.4. Any other personnel designated by the wing, operations group, or squadron command-
        ers.
     1.11.3. An instructor must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight for unqualified,
     non-current, and flying training level E aircrew members.

1.12. Administration of AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 1. Units will establish requirements for AFI 11-2C-9
volumes through MAJCOM publications distribution channels in accordance with AFI 37-161, Distribu-
tion Management. MAJCOM supplements to AFI 11-2C-9 volumes will be distributed within each MAJ-

                         INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (PHASE I)

2.1. General Requirements. Unless otherwise indicated, the primary method of initial qualification is to
attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in AFCAT 36-2223. When attendance
is not practical or quotas are not available, units will request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification train-
ing, using formal school courseware (see paragraph 1.2. for waiver requirements). AFI 11-202, Volume
1, defines initial qualification training.

2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites in accor-
dance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

2.3. Ground Training Requirements for Aircrew Members. Complete ground training requirements
for initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

2.4. Flying Training Requirements for Aircrew Members. Complete flying training requirements for
initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

2.5. Conversion/Difference Qualification.
   2.5.1. Difference Training. C-9 units should apply difference qualification training (DQT) for major
   modifications (e.g., Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)-compliant avionics, flight management
   computer (FMC) differences) as directed by MAJCOMs. For fleet-wide modifications, apply initial
   cadre criteria in paragraph 2.5.2. HQ AMC, in coordination with other MAJCOMs will provide guid-
   ance and overprinted AF Forms 4024, Training Accomplishment Report. Overprinting will be done
   in accordance with AFI 37-160, Volume 8, The Air Force Publications and Forms Management Pro-
   gram--Developing and Processing Forms.
   2.5.2. Conversion Training. Conversion applies to units converting from another Mission Design
   Series (MDS) to the C-9. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to
   begin aircrew conversion using qualified personnel from other units if possible. Converting units may
   request initial cadre waiver of PAI time requirement. Send waivers through MAJCOM channels and
   include the information specified in Figure 1.1. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft flown
   and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section of the waiver.
       2.5.2.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held (e.g., MP
       to EP) unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
       2.5.2.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and flight
       examiners by crew qualification.

2.6. Multiple Qualifications.
   2.6.1. Aircrew Members maintaining dual qualification in different model aircraft will, as a mini-
   mum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph
   2.7.)
14                                                                    AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies senior officer quali-
fication requirements.
     2.7.1. Senior officers who maintain FTL E maintain basic aircraft qualification (BAQ) requirements.
     2.7.2. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs must be fully qualified flight examiners in their primary
     assigned aircraft. These individuals do not require nor do they have to maintain instructor qualifica-
     tion or mission ready status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs and OG/CCs must maintain a
     minimum of FTL E requirements and be flight examiner certified according to AFI 11-2C-9, Volume
     2, C-9 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria (forthcoming). This policy is based on the premise that these indi-
     viduals already possess a strong history of experience, judgment, and superior airmanship to evaluate
     high standards of performance in the air. As a result, additional currency/proficiency requirements to
     maintain FE status are not required. Also, FE status for additional aircraft assigned to the unit is not
     required. NAF/CCs and OG/CCs maintaining FTL E require instructor supervision when at the con-
     trols of an aircraft.
     2.7.3. Senior officers who were previously qualified as C-9 aircraft commanders or higher are not
     required to attend the initial qualification course unless unqualified more than 5 years.

2.8. Flight Surgeons. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, establishes flight surgeon initial qualification require-
ments.

2.9. Flight Mechanic (FM) Qualification Requirements. Train FMs using MAJCOM-approved train-
ing programs.

2.10. Flight Attendant (FA) Qualification Requirements. Upon entry as an FA, the individual will be
assigned a special duty identifier (SDI) of 8A000. Normal progression is from basic aircraft qualified to
second FA to first FA. A previously qualified FA may qualify directly to first FA at the discretion of the
FA operations superintendent. At the discretion of the gaining unit commander, an FA qualified in C-9,
C-20, CT-43, or C-137 type aircraft may maintain their current qualification level on completion and doc-
umentation of the appropriate difference training.
     2.10.1. Students qualifying to second FA are required to meet the following criteria: Complete a local
     unit training course and demonstrate proficiency in duties and responsibilities in aircraft and systems
     operations, emergency equipment, emergency procedures, and passenger comfort and care. Also,
     complete a minimum of three missions (EXEMPT: Previously qualified FAs). Successful completion
     of second FA checkride is required.
     2.10.2. Upgrade to first FA requires demonstrated proficiency in the following: Mission planning;
     reservations; user coordination; fleet, customs, and immigration; meal planning, purchase, and prepa-
     ration; financial accountability; forms preparation; FA direction and delegation; and mission pacing.
     Additional requirements are approval of the FA section noncommissioned officer-in-charge (NCOIC),
     complete training requirements for second FA, and a successful first FA flight evaluation. Upgrade to
     first FA requires approval by the squadron FA operations superintendent or higher if designated
     locally.
     2.10.3. FAs are authorized a one-time attendance at the Emergency Egress Training Course.

   2.11.1. Normal progress is from student CSO, to second CSO, to first CSO. A previously qualified
   CSO may qualify directly to first CSO at the discretion of the CSO Operations Superintendent. For
   units without second CSOs, upgrade will be directly to first CSO.
   2.11.2. Students will qualify as second CSO after completing a local unit training course and demon-
   strating proficiency with duties and responsibilities, aircraft and systems operations, emergency
   equipment and procedures, and communications procedures.
   2.11.3. Upgrade to first CSO requires demonstrated proficiency in: mission planning, predeparture
   procedures, inflight procedures, after-landing and post-flight procedures, special procedures and coor-
   dination, and a successful completion of a first CSO flight evaluation.
   2.11.4. 86 OG CSOs must possess a TOP SECRET special background investigation (TS-SBI) with
   access to sensitive-compartmented information (SCI) authorized.

2.12. Reports. The formal school will maintain a record of training rosters and temporary duty (TDY)
orders and prepare and dispatch AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, for graduates. The ATS has a
post-training feedback system that elicits information and comments from students, supervisors, and
examiners in order to continually improve, update, and refine the ATS. Commanders and supervisors
should promote use of this feedback system to its fullest extent.

2.13. Failure to Complete Training. If any aircrew member fails to complete a formal course, the for-
mal school will send a recommendation to the individual’s unit (see paragraph 1.4.1.4) on whether he or
she should complete training in-unit (which requires a waiver), be eliminated, or return to the formal
school for training.
   2.13.1. Request to recall a student from a formal school course must be sent from the student’s MAJ-
   COM. Headquarters will accomplish all necessary coordination with appropriate agencies. Emer-
   gency recall during non-duty hours may be coordinated directly with the formal school.

                       MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (PHASE II)

3.1. Time Periods for Mission Qualification. Active duty aircrew members will complete mission
qualification training within 90 days (180 days for AFRC) of starting training, or as specified in MAJ-
COM supplement. All aircrew members will complete mission qualification prior to entering special
mission qualification or upgrade training. On completion of these requirements and any additional local
training requirements, aircrews will be certified as mission-ready by unit operations officer.

3.2. Ground Training Requirements. All academic ground training required for mission qualification
will be completed prior to certification or qualification in the unit operational mission. The applicable
events listed in Table 3.1. must be accomplished before flying in the seat on operational missions with
passengers (not applicable for senior officers or staff officers maintaining BAQ). Unit operations officer
will determine which events not specifically required by this instruction must be accomplished prior to
flying operational missions.

NOTES:
  1. Events may be accomplished at formal school or in-unit. Previously certified and qualified mis-
     sion-ready aircrew members transferring between units only need G002, G120 and any applicable
     events in which they have lost currency.
  2. Pilot upgrade aircrew members only need G002 and other applicable events in which they are
     non-current.
  3. LS08 may include LS05 (ACDE), and LS06 (Life support equipment).
  4. Flight Surgeons only need G010, G120, G231 and LS08. G231 (CRM) is a one-time event for
     flight surgeons.
   5. See training event descriptions in Attachment 2 for additional requirements.
   6. Not applicable for aircrews in units not equipped to perform P280 (Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Pro-
      tection System [AERPS] or similar gear).
   7. May be combined with G060.
   8. When directed by MAJCOM
   3.2.1. Ground training accomplished during mission qualification establishes due dates for subse-
   quent continuation training. Completion of S-V80-A, S-V90-A, and initial life support equipment
   training during formal school establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for
   recurring Combat Survival (LS02) and Water Survival (LS03) training. Completion of S-V80-A
   establishes the due date for recurring Law of Armed Conflict (G100), and Protection from Terrorism
   (G110) training.

3.3. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.3.1. Basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) aircrew members pursuing MR status will accomplish Training
   Level "D" (see paragraph 4.3.) continuation training requirements.
   3.3.2. After arrival at duty station, aircrew members must receive a supervised duty familiarization or
   orientation flight and local flying area or associated hazards brief (not applicable for in-unit initial,
   requalification, or upgrade training).
   3.3.3. Aircrew members must complete the following flying training requirements prior to being cer-
   tified mission-ready; MAJCOMs may add additional guidance to meet MAJCOM requirements.
       3.3.3.1. Local or unit orientation training flight (with an instructor).
       3.3.3.2. Mission observation flight.
       3.3.3.3. Operational mission (with an instructor).
       3.3.3.4. Category II instrument landing system (ILS) training (normally accomplished at formal
       school).

3.4. Category II ILS Aircrew Training. This prescribes the training program for pilots and copilots in
the C-9 that must be accomplished prior to Category II ILS certification.
   3.4.1. Training requirements.
18                                                                    AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

        3.4.1.1. Seat occupancy during Category II ILS approach and landing training. A qualified Cate-
        gory II ILS instructor or flight examiner pilot will occupy the appropriate seat, as applicable, dur-
        ing pilot and copilot Category II ILS training.
        3.4.1.2. Actual weather--no lower than a 200-foot ceiling and 1/2-mile visibility (runway visual
        range of 24) or 800 meters day and night.
        3.4.1.3. Crosswind component--15 knots maximum.
     3.4.2. Category II ILS training program. The following ground and flight training requirements will
     be incorporated into the initial qualification course:
        3.4.2.1. Ground training. The training program must provide the pilot and copilot training in the
        following subjects:
            3.4.2.1.1. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of Category II ILS and
            visual aids, e.g., approach lights, in-runway lights, transmissometers, etc.
            3.4.2.1.2. Using runway environment visual cues during Category II ILS weather conditions,
            with respect to different glide slope angles, flight deck cutoff angles, and altitudes at which
            these visual cues are normally discernible.
            3.4.2.1.3. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of Category II ILS airborne
            systems, e.g., flight director system; automatic approach coupler; system used to identify the
            decision height for the approaches, instrumentation and comparater warning lights, and
            auto-throttles.
            3.4.2.1.4. Resolution of decision height or missed approach point or minimum descent alti-
            tude with component failures (ground or flight).
        3.4.2.2. Flight training. Flight or simulator training will cover the following subjects:
            3.4.2.2.1. Resolution of decision height.
            3.4.2.2.2. Missed approach procedures.
            3.4.2.2.3. Runway visual range, uses, and limitations.
            3.4.2.2.4. Transition from instrument to visual flight cues.
            3.4.2.2.5. Under conditions of low visibility.
            3.4.2.2.6. Procedures for equipment malfunctions (e.g., comparator lights on).
            3.4.2.2.7. Review of Category II ILS specifications.
            3.4.2.2.8. Practice at least three approaches in each authorized equipment mode (coupled and
            manual modes)
     3.4.3. Category II ILS Aircrew Certification. Conduct according to AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 2. Cate-
     gory II ILS training and evaluation should normally be accomplished at the formal school during ini-
     tial qualification and documented on the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. If
     training is accomplished in-unit, then the training should be documented on the AF Form 1381, USAF
     Certification of AirCrew Training. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may exempt aircrew members from
     CAT II certification due to theater constraints.
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                               19

       3.4.3.1. Scheduling. Qualified pilots and copilots may receive Category II ILS evaluations on the
       same flight while occupying their respective seats. When a pilot or copilot is evaluated individu-
       ally, the opposite seat will be occupied by a qualified Category II ILS pilot or copilot.

3.5. Theater Indoctrination (TI). Theater indoctrination (M060) will be conducted according to AFI
11-202, Volume 1, and the MAJCOM supplement. As a minimum, training should include a thorough
review of theater unique instrument requirements and procedures, use of non-DoD instrument approach
procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches, theater weather conditions, local area pro-
cedures, and host nation agreements. Squadron commanders or AFRC Ops Supervisors are responsible
for the accomplishment of this training for all assigned and attached aircrew members and will design a
program to meet requirements unique to unit operations. Completion of TI training does not require
attainment of MR status.
   3.5.1. USAFE: All USAFE aircrews will complete TI ground training prior to flight training. TI
   flight training may be combined with initial mission qualification training (MQT) sorties, but must be
   the first sortie flown in theater. Supervision will be an instructor pilot (IP).
       3.5.1.1. Ground Training. The wing/group will develop the TI ground training program. The unit
       may develop procedures specific to their mission and location, however the following blocks of
       instruction will be covered as a minimum:
           3.5.1.1.1. Instrument training: a thorough review of theater unique instrument requirements
           and procedures to include but not limited to: navaids, European air traffic control, Flight Infor-
           mation Publications/Foreign Clearance Guide study, non-DoD approach procedures (e.g.,
           Jeppesen), required instrumentation for specific approaches, local publications and regula-
           tions, flight planning, European weather phenomena (emphasis on local conditions), spatial
           disorientation, and theater buffer zone procedures.
           3.5.1.1.2. Video presentations: Jeppesen approach charts.
           3.5.1.1.3. Basic airmanship review: visual illusions, command special interest items, USAFE
           local area exercise procedures.
       3.5.1.2. Flight Training. The wing/group developed TI program will consist of a minimum of one
       sortie emphasizing European flying environment, Air Traffic Control procedures, basic airman-
       ship and local orientation. Individual TI events may be accomplished during MQT, however, all
       TI events will be complete prior to MR or theater certification. Aircrews will demonstrate profi-
       ciency in the following events: route abort (when applicable); all instrument procedures including
       each type of instrument approach procedure the aircraft is capable of flying; operational mission
       or unit specific mission training requirements.

                              CONTINUATION TRAINING (PHASE III)

4.1. Aircrew Status. C-9 aircrews are assigned to either mission ready (MR) or basic aircraft qualifica-
tion (BAQ) status. The continuation training program provides aircrew members with the volume, fre-
quency, and mix of training necessary to perform unit missions. Accomplishing the minimum number of
required events only ensures currency. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events.
Unit commanders will ensure all aircrew members receive sufficient event intensive training to maintain
proficiency.
     4.1.1. Mission Ready (MR). For SORTS, operational tasking, and deployments, a mission-ready air-
     crew member is defined as one who is available, qualified, and certified in the squadron’s mission
     (completed mission qualification training for applicable crew position).
     4.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume1.
        4.1.2.1. BMC individuals must be able to obtain full qualification in the unit mission within 45
        days.
     4.1.3. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume1.
     4.1.4. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). An individual who is noncurrent or unqualified in the aircraft,
     incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission is a nonmis-
     sion ready (NMR) aircrew member.
        4.1.4.1. If the aircrew member is NMR for failure to maintain currency per paragraph 4.6.1.1.
        place the aircrew member in supervised status for that event (individual flies with an instructor of
        like specialty) until required training is accomplished. Loss of currency prohibits an individual
        from flying outside of the CONUS or accomplishing unsupervised inflight duties in the noncur-
        rent event(s). For example, if the individual is noncurrent for an event such as small arms training,
        the individual may fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties which are not scheduled for and do not
        accomplish tanker air refueling. MAJCOMs outside of the CONUS may allow individuals to fly
        local and routine missions (as defined by the OG/CC), and noncontingency overseas sorties in
        their respective theater.
        4.1.4.2. If an aircrew member is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training, the
        operations group commander has two options:
            4.1.4.2.1. Waive the required training in accordance with paragraph 4.6.1. or 4.6.2. The indi-
            vidual is then a MR aircrew member.
            4.1.4.2.2. Place the aircrew member in supervised status (individual flies with an instructor of
            like specialty) until required training is accomplished. The operations group commander may
            allow individuals to fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties if loss of MR status was for failure to
            complete ground/flying continuation training. MAJCOMs outside of the CONUS may allow
            individuals to fly local and routine missions (as defined by the OG/CC), and noncontingency
            overseas sorties in their respective theater.
     4.1.5. In addition to the above, MR, BMC, and BAQ aircrew members must have accomplished and/
     or maintained the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for their respective status, as well as all
     events listed in the applicable ground and semiannual flying continuation tables.
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                             21

4.2. Training Levels (TL). Before each semiannual period, the squadron commander or designated rep-
resentative determines the training level (TL) of each assigned aircrew member, and will ensure that indi-
viduals receive training to successfully perform unit missions and maintain individual proficiency.
Aircrew members may be assigned TL levels that are more restrictive, but never less restrictive than the
requirements in paragraph 4.2.2. TL definitions follow:
   4.2.1. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
       4.2.1.1. FTL "A" -highly experienced aircrew members. This may include MR or NMR AMC
       headquarters and TACC personnel; formal school instructors; NAF personnel; AMWC instruc-
       tors; wing, operations group, and squadron commanders; operations officers, personnel assigned
       to OG evaluation positions, and any instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Squadron com-
       manders have the discretion to assign highly experienced MR line aircrew members to this level.
       NOTE: NMR aircrew members assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, TACC, AMWC,
       Tanker airlift control element, CCTS, or a direct reporting unit are categorized as Basic Mission
       Capable (BMC) and assigned to FTL “A” and GTL “4.” In addition to GTL “4” requirements,
       these individuals must also accomplish annual CRM training requirements. These individuals
       may fly unsupervised on local training missions provided they are current and qualified. They
       require instructor supervision on all other missions. Since these aircrew members do not maintain
       MR status, they cannot log MP, MN, MF, or MB time (may log EP, IP, or FP time, as qualified). If
       refresher simulator training requirements are not met, the individual must fly with an instructor of
       like specialty unless waived (see paragraph 4.6.)
       4.2.1.2. FTL "B" - experienced, mission ready aircrew members.
       4.2.1.3. FTL "C" - MR aircrew members. Copilots should be assigned to FTL "C." If desired,
       squadron commanders may assign highly proficient copilots or first pilots to FTLs "A" or "B."
       4.2.1.4. FTL "D" - basic aircraft qualified aircrew members. Designated primarily for basic air-
       craft qualified aircrew members that are pursuing MR status.
       4.2.1.5. FTL "E" - basic aircraft qualified, non-instructor staff (may include senior officers,
       MAJCOM, NAF, and TACC individuals who are not maintaining MR or instructor status). FTL E
       requirements are sufficient for BAQ and BMC status, but are insufficient for MR status. Aircrew
       members assigned to FTL E will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.2.2. Ground Training Levels (GTL).
       4.2.2.1. GTL “1” - highly experienced aircrew members with greater than ten years of opera-
       tional flying in their rated specialty.
       4.2.2.2. GTL "2" - experienced aircrew members with greater than five but less than ten years of
       operational flying in their rated specialty.
       4.2.2.3. GTL "3" - inexperienced aircrew members with less than five years of operational flying
       in their rated specialty.
       4.2.2.4. GTL “4” - NMR senior officers and staff officers.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL or GTL. Once the semiannual period begins, personnel should not be moved to
   a level requiring fewer events. EXCEPTION: Basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) aircrew members may
   be placed in a different FTL any time after attaining MR status.
22                                                                     AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

     4.2.4. Established TLs do not preclude the squadron commander from scheduling an individual for
     additional training.

4.3. Training Events/Tables. Standardized AFORMS training event identifiers and descriptions are
located in Attachment 2. Unit defined events will be designated “X” events (i.e., X020).
     4.3.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. In addition to events accomplished on training and opera-
     tional missions, those flight events accomplished on a satisfactory qualification, mission qualification,
     specialized mission qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited towards the individ-
     ual's currency requirements and establishes a subsequent due date.
        4.3.1.1. Aircrew members who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight eval-
        uation will not log continuation training requirements for those events graded Q-3 until requali-
        fied.
        4.3.1.2. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
        4.3.1.3. Simulator Credit for Training Events. Do not credit flying continuation-training events
        accomplished in an ATD unless allowed by this chapter or its respective event description in
        Attachment 2. Instrument approaches accomplished in the simulator (FAA Level C or better)
        may be credited towards flying requirements. Simulator events can not be accomplished to regain
        currency. The instructor upgrade simulator training may not be credited for annual refresher sim-
        ulator.
        4.3.1.4. Instructor Training Requirements and Responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
        may credit 50% of their requirements while instructing or evaluating EXCEPTION: instructor
        and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or landings flown by another pilot.

4.4. Currency for Aircrew Members.
     4.4.1. Ground Continuation Training Events. Aircrew members will comply with requirements of
     Table 4.1. (flight surgeons, see Table 4.2.). See Attachment 2 for course descriptions. Additional
     training events are in Table 4.6.
        4.4.1.1. Aircrew members attached to units (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, AMWC, etc.) may accomplish
        ground training events at locations other than their units of attachment. Individuals are responsi-
        ble for reporting accomplished training to their unit of attachment AFORMS office.
        4.4.1.2. Centralized aircrew training record. All training events will be recorded in the AFORMS
        database. Event identifiers are listed in Attachment 1. Combined training events may have only
        one AFORMS entry. All one-time and PCS-in events will be entered into the AFORMS database.
        These events need not be maintained on individual currency reports.
        4.4.1.3. Mission ready (MR) requirements must be completed prior to participating in an opera-
        tional mission as a qualified aircrew member (Table 4.1. and Table 4.2. restrictions/exceptions
        apply). Local training may be flown before completing all events, provided the individual has a
        current flight physical, and has completed physiological, initial ground egress, marshaling, and
        life support training.
        4.4.1.4. Block Training. Operations support squadron (OSS) training offices normally provide all
        annual ground training required to maintain currency for aircrew members. EXCEPTION: Phys-
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                             23

        iological training, flight physicals, refresher ground training provided by the ATS contractor, and
        recurring written examinations. OSS training offices may also:
           4.4.1.4.1. Establish and administer non-ATS centralized aircrew training.
           4.4.1.4.2. Publish training schedules and quotas in the wing operations plan.
           4.4.1.4.3. Ensure aircrew members entered into training are not removed until completion.
           4.4.1.4.4. Determine instructor augmentation. The operations group commander will direct
           augmentation, as required. EXCEPTION: The formal school may not be augmented in this
           manner.
        4.4.1.5. Units will use the appropriate AFI 11-202, Volume 1, paragraph 4.3.1 forms as source
        documents to record all accomplished training and to update the Air Force Operations Resource
        Management System (AFORMS) database. The host operations systems manager (HOSM) will
        provide event numbers to identify each training requirement and establish local procedures to
        ensure frequent data input to AFORMS.
        4.4.1.6. The following will be emphasized in continuation training courses:
           4.4.1.6.1. Crew resource management (CRM).
           4.4.1.6.2. Systems knowledge and operating procedures.
           4.4.1.6.3. Normal, emergency, and instrument flight procedures.
           4.4.1.6.4. Mission-Oriented Simulator Training (MOST).
           4.4.1.6.5. Operational Risk Management (ORM).

   4.4.2. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Table 4.3. lists the standardized flying require-
   ments for all pilots (includes first pilots and copilots) and Table 4.4. lists requirements for CSOs, FAs,
   and FMs. See Attachment 2 for event descriptions.
          4.4.2.1. Dual-Seat Qualification. Aircraft commanders will be dual seat qualified, and may
          accomplish training events in either seat. Copilots may not fly in the left seat unless under direct
          IP supervision. IPs may fly in either seat.
          4.4.2.2. Simulator Credit for Training Events. See paragraph 4.3.1.3.
          4.4.2.3. Senior officers and staff aircrew members maintaining basic aircraft qualification will, as
          a minimum, maintain FTL E requirements. This requirement also applies to additional aircraft an
          individual may be qualified in. In addition to always flying with an instructor of like specialty,
          FTL E senior pilots must be current in takeoffs, landings, and instrument approaches prior to car-
          rying passengers.
          4.4.2.4. Currency Credit Permitted for Evaluation. Credit individual flying requirements for each
          item satisfactorily completed on a recurring instrument, qualification, or mission evaluation.

4.5. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, outlines proration of training requirements for air-
crew members not available for flying duties.

Table 4.5. Individual Availability.
Days Available    Months Available

   4.5.1. Use the following formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down to the
   nearest whole number but not less than 1 (e.g., 5.6 rounds to 5). Use Table 4.5. to determine the num-
   ber of months available. EXCEPTION: When an individual permanently changes station to a unit
   flying the same model aircraft and enters the same training level or lower, credit may be taken for
   training accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time available
   (time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the training
   period. Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for CONUS and 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS.
   Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.5.2. Prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.

4.6. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail
to complete ground or semiannual flying continuation training requirements. NOTE: The operations
group commander may allow individuals to fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties after they have been
declared NMR for failure to complete ground or flying continuation training requirements. The following
guidance applies:
     4.6.1. Flight Training. At the end of the semiannual training period, the squadron commander will
     review AFORMS products for those aircrew members who failed to accomplish all required semian-
     nual flying training events (includes all events listed in the flying continuation training tables). The
     squadron commander will either direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or
     request an operations group commander waiver. If the AFORMS review shows enough flying events
     were recently accomplished to ensure MR proficiency, the operations group commander or equivalent
     may waive the requirements. The same flying training events will not be waived for two consecutive
     training periods. This waiver authority must be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure aircrew
     members receive the proper quantity of flying events to remain proficient and allow the operations
     group commander to determine MR status and additional training requirements when those training
     quotas are not met. EXCEPTION: Flight currency will only be waived under extreme circumstances
     and only at the MAJCOM level. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in the flying
     continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual)
     within which an event must be accomplished (listed in the "CUR" column).
        4.6.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in super-
        vised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring that
        event. Aircrew members are non-current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., an aircrew
        member that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-current
        on 1 November). Regain currency based on the time elapsed since becoming non-current as
        described in paragraph 1.6.
        4.6.1.2. Requalification Training Limits and Requirements. An aircrew member is unqualified on
        either loss of currency exceeding 6 months or expiration of his or her qualification evaluation,
        whichever occurs first. See paragraph 1.7. for requalification requirements.
     4.6.2. Ground Training. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive ground continuation training. This
     waiver authority must be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the indi-
     vidual aircrew member’s experience and proficiency level (i.e., waivers will not be based on an air-
     crew member’s availability). The operations group commander will determine the allowable time
     period of the waiver (the training should be completed at the earliest opportunity). This waiver is
     allowed for unforeseen circumstances and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplish-
     ment.

                                          UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Upgrade Training. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade to first pilot, aircraft commander, instructor, and examiner. The primary method of upgrade is
through the formal school for all applicable courses. In-unit upgrade maybe accomplished with a waiver
in accordance with this instruction.

5.2. Aircraft Commander (AC).
     5.2.1. General. Flying time prerequisites required for upgrade are based on a copilot or first pilot
     having gained knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish unit missions. Unit com-
     manders must ensure continuation training programs emphasize these areas. Flying experience
     should include left-seat time prior to entering formal school upgrade training. AC candidates must
     have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions before entering the formal
     upgrade program. Additionally, the following guidance applies:
        5.2.1.1. Select upgrade candidates based on upgrade potential, retainability, and mission require-
        ments.
        5.2.1.2. Fill all available quotas before requesting in-unit upgrade.
        5.2.1.3. Use the approved ATS courseware (or command approved courseware for non-ATS).
        5.2.1.4. Complete applicable ground and flying requirements and prerequisites contained in this
        instruction.
     5.2.2. In-Unit Upgrade. Formal school attendance is the primary method for AC qualification train-
     ing. In-unit upgrade using courseware provided by the formal school is the secondary method. Send
     waiver request for in-unit upgrade to HQ AMC/DOT. Other than AMC units, send waiver request
     through appropriate channels to the MAJCOM, and a courtesy copy of the approved waiver to HQ
     AMC/DOT.
     5.2.3. Graduates of an aircraft commander course will be designated NMR aircraft commanders.
     NMR aircraft commanders will accomplish aircraft commander continuation training requirements
     (training level assigned by squadron commander) and can serve as a MCF or CP augmentee while
     non-mission ready (they must be current and qualified). MR status, on completion of mission qualifi-
     cation training and associated evaluation and certification, will be validated by a review and certifica-
     tion board. There is no flying-hour requirement for MR status.
     5.2.4. AMC mobility enhancement crossflow program-selects will attend aircraft commander train-
     ing for the crossflow aircraft. Crossflow selects will be entered into AC mission qualification training
     upon arrival at the unit. Delays to mission AC upgrade are contrary to the intention of the crossflow
     program and will be avoided.
     5.2.5. Ground Training. Complete pre-upgrade events listed in an approved training guide, an air-
     craft systems review, and all simulator training.
     5.2.6. Flying Training. Complete required training flights as listed in the approved formal
     courseware; complete an FP evaluation.
AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999                                                                                 31

       5.2.6.1. The MP candidate will be scheduled with an IP for additional mission familiarization
       training and will perform AC responsibilities on at least one operational mission.
       5.2.6.2. Complete an initial en route evaluation or certification.

5.3. Other Crew Positions. Special upgrades for FAs, CSOs, and FMs and additional aircrew positions
addressed in the MAJCOM supplement as appropriate.

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Course is designed to teach selected aircrew members fundamentals
and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment, ability
to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.4.1. Instructor upgrade prerequisites.
       5.4.1.1. Prior to beginning in-unit instructor upgrade, when authorized, all candidate must have
       attended a formal Air Force or in-unit instructor preparatory course. For ground and flight train-
       ing requirements, all initial instructor upgrade candidates will complete training on the principles
       of instruction at the appropriate formal school if available (see paragraph 5.4.3.).
       5.4.1.2. Each unit commander/operations officer will ensure that the IP candidate has completed
       the level IV training guide and meets all the prerequisites required by this regulation, and has com-
       pleted a minimum of two right seat training sorties prior to arriving at the formal school.
   5.4.2. Instructor Academic Training.
       5.4.2.1. An instructor must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft systems and equipment, normal
       and emergency operating procedures, prohibited maneuvers, and aircraft performance under all
       conditions of flight. Instructor candidates will demonstrate knowledge by organizing and con-
       ducting ground briefings on a cross section of subjects from applicable directives. Briefings may
       be conducted as part of the existing continuation training or flying safety program, but the briefing
       must be critiqued by a pilot instructor for content, organization and delivery.
       5.4.2.2. The instructor candidate will receive ground training on training documentation (see
       Attachment 3).
       5.4.2.3. Instructor written examinations. Conduct according to AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 2. NOTE:
       The formal school may develop its own open and closed book examinations for testing during ini-
       tial instructor upgrade training.
       5.4.2.4. Instructor/Examiner CRM. Initial instructor CRM should be included in formal and
       in-unit upgrade. Units develop course material locally for in-unit upgrades.
   5.4.3. Flying Training.
       5.4.3.1. IPs must be fully aware that they are in command of the aircraft on training flights and are
       responsible at all times for conduct of the flight and safety of the aircraft. If at any time during the
       flight the judgment or proficiency of a student at the controls raises a question in the instructor’s
       mind as to the student’s ability to complete a prescribed maneuver safely, the instructor will take
       over controls of the aircraft immediately. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
       proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming control of the aircraft.
       5.4.3.2. IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis will be on right-seat pro-
       ficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, practical emergency situation set-up, and
32                                                                        AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

        operating aircraft systems. A minimum of one touch and go landing should be accomplished in
        the left seat, emphasizing the difference in cockpit layout and aircrew duties that affect left seat
        instructing.
        5.4.3.3. An initial instructor flight evaluation is required.
        5.4.3.4. Instructor proficiency guidelines. In the first quarter, following upgrade, emphasis
        should be placed on flying the newly certified IP in the local pattern to reinforce upgrade training
        and to gain experience in the local flying environment.
     5.4.4. Instructor Preparatory Course (IPC). All instructor candidates must have attended an IPC at a
     formal Air Force school or at the unit level.
        5.4.4.1. Unit level IPC. Wings may conduct IPC for instructor candidates at the squadron level.
        Each squadron IPC program will be approved by the appropriate OSS/OST and an information
        copy will be forwarded to MAJCOM/DOT. Each IPC program will have a primary instructor
        appointed by the applicable squadron commander to be responsible for course content, schedul-
        ing, records, and training of new IPC instructors. IPC staff may be of any size but should be lim-
        ited to only enough to accomplish unit requirements.
        5.4.4.2. IPC Guidance. Unit level IPCs will be conducted according to a plan submitted to and
        approved by the appropriate OSS/OST. Primary instructors will maintain course content and
        update when necessary. A record of course attendees will be maintained for at least 2 calendar
        years. An AF Form 1256 will be issued to each graduate and signed by the primary instructor.
        Unit level IPC operating instructions are permitted and encouraged.
     5.4.5. Individuals who have not attended a formal school may, with a MAJCOM waiver, upgrade
     in-unit if formal school course slots are not available. Waivers will be reviewed on a case-by-case
     basis. Send waiver request to appropriate MAJCOM with an info copy to HQ AMC/DOT.

5.5. Flight Examiner Qualifications . Squadron commanders will recommend instructors for flight
examiner certification. Instructors identified for certification as flight examiner must possess satisfactory
knowledge of MAJCOM training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to administer an
evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program and AFI
11-2C-9, Volume 2.
     5.5.1. Examiner candidates should observe qualified examiners conducting a cross-section of evalua-
     tions, to include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge. The
     examiner candidate must observe the inflight portion of an evaluation.
     5.5.2. Examiner candidates should receive a briefing on command policies and interpretations of AFI
     11-202, Volume 2 and AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 2, and MAJCOM supplements.
     5.5.3. There is no evaluation required for upgrade. Certification will be documented on the AF Form
     1381 in accordance with AFI 11-2C-9, Volume 2.

NOTES:
    1. Any previous operational fixed wing pilot with a total of 500 military flight hours or any previ-
       ous MP or higher will normally receive FP training and evaluation during qualification train-
       ing. Total/PAA hour requirements must be met prior to the enroute evaluation and
       certification as mission-ready pilot (MP).
    2. All flying-hour requirements must be attained prior to entry into an IP upgrade program. Only
       primary and secondary time is creditable towards PAA time. Simulator time is not creditable
       towards PAA time.
    3. Unit training chief must ensure AF Form 63, Officers Active Duty Service Commitment
       ADSC Counseling Statement, is signed prior to beginning upgrade training according to AFI
       36-2107.

                              AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. This chapter applies to all aircrew members
attending formal schools using ATS courseware. Normally, the ATS contractor provides academic and
simulator training and the Air Force conducts all flight training and evaluations. The guidance in this
chapter is for all mobility MDSs and will have varying degrees of applicability for the C-9. Contact HQ
AMC/DOTA for guidance on specific contractor-provided training. NOTE: The current simulator con-
tract governs Air Force-contractor relationships and obligations and may only be modified by the con-
tracting officer. Units will not levy additional requirements on contractors. Contact the MAJCOM
training office with recommended changes to the aircrew training program.

6.2. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. It is imperative that students com-
plete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will enroll on a full-time basis.
Relieve students of duties not directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may con-
tinue their normal duties as time permits.

6.3. ATS Course Prerequisites. Each ATS course is designed and based on student prerequisites being
met. Prerequisites may include a minimum number of flying hours, squadron operations officer recom-
mendation, and completion of applicable training guides. Consult the course summary document (CSD)
and AFCAT 36-2223 to determine student entry level for each course.

6.4. Lesson Objectives.
   6.4.1. Lesson Objective Development. All objectives must meet requirements of Instructional Sys-
   tems Development (ISD) process as defined in AFH 36-2235, Information for Designers of Instruc-
   tional Systems.
   6.4.2. Lesson Objective Description. These are subject to changes in the contract.
   6.4.3. Lesson Objective Use. Instructors and examiners use lesson objectives as a reference docu-
   ment to establish training and evaluation standards. Submit recommended changes through MAJ-
   COM channels.
   6.4.4. Course Material. All student guides, training guides, line development guides, etc., will be
   provided by the ATS contractor. Local procedures will be developed by unit training offices to ensure
   that students bring the current version of the course material to the start of each class.
       6.4.4.1. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training.
           6.4.4.1.1. CRM Development. CRM trains aircrew members to cope with potential problems
           in human behavior affecting aircrew performance. Documented studies of aircraft accidents
           and additional data suggests most human behavior problems observed among aircrews could
           be grouped into six categories: communication, situational awareness, team leadership, mis-
           sion analysis, decision-making process, and stress management.
           6.4.4.1.2. CRM Program. CRM is presented on a recurring basis throughout the ATS. Intro-
           duction to CRM is presented during initial qualification training and is imbedded in recurring
           phase training.
36                                                                     AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

6.5. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
     6.5.1. If a student’s training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the government rep-
     resentative (wing training, operations officer, etc.). Following review of the student’s record, the gov-
     ernment representative will determine whether to continue or terminate training.
     6.5.2. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training office for stu-
     dents who display substandard performance.
     6.5.3. Remediation Procedures. The contractor and contracting officer must receive prompt notifica-
     tion of unsatisfactory performance following a contracted course. Local procedures must ensure that
     notification is completed within 24 hours of failure to complete a course and within 48 hours after
     return to home station for OCONUS units. Remediation subsequent to a failed course completion
     may be the contractor’s responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending
     on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is required to achieve maximum trainee
     progress. Direct contact with appropriate contracted instructor’s supervisor is encouraged.

6.6. Courseware Changes. Submit courseware changes through appropriate MAJCOM channels, with
information copies to HQ AMC/DOT. The reporting requirement in this paragraph is exempt from licens-
ing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.12 of AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Man-
agement Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
     6.6.1. Master Task List (MTL) and Evaluation Standards Document (ESD).
        6.6.1.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD were developed (are required) to provide the basis
        for courseware development. The MTL/ESD have been/will be approved by HQ AMC/DOT and
        is the evaluation criteria for validating an aircrew member’s performance. Flight examiners and
        instructors who evaluate or train aircrew members will use the MTL/ESD to determine the ability
        of an individual to meet the performance levels required to be mission qualified.
        6.6.1.2. MTL/ESD Use. The MTL/ESD will be used by flight examiners and instructors in the
        training and evaluation of aircrew members. Distribution of the MTL/ESD is sufficient to ensure
        that each squadron has reference copies for each crew position. Recommended changes will be
        submitted through Air Force channels using an approved quality assurance change proposal
        (QACP) process. Changes to the MTL/ESD frequently result in changes to associated
        courseware.

6.7. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations (AMC Only). The contractor shall identify, publish and
update (as appropriate) to the MAJCOM training division a list of designated aircrew training instructors
to fly aboard MAJCOM aircraft. Contractor instructors (including site and training managers) are permit-
ted to fly and accompany AMC aircrews on aircraft with HQ AMC/DO approval as (1) a designated addi-
tional crew member (ACM) observer on a local training flight or (2) observer in Mission Essential
Ground Personnel (MEGP) passenger status. DFARS 52.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk applies.
     6.7.1. ACM (Observer) or Non-Aircrew member Status on Local Training Flights. The contractor
     shall coordinate with HQ AMC/DOT and mutually agree on the frequency of these flights. Contractor
     instructors shall be considered unqualified aircrew members and are authorized an ACM seat (jump
     seat) during any phase of flight. Emergency procedures and touch-and-go landings may be accom-
     plished when the observer is on a local training flight. Contractor personnel in this status will not be
     allowed access to aircraft controls nor shall they occupy a primary crew position. The contractor shall

  prepare and maintain current written procedures (according to AFI 13-201, US Air Force Airspace
  Management) applicable to the training requirements of observer aircrew members. Training require-
  ments include, but are not limited to the following:
     6.7.1.1. Personal and life support equipment training.
     6.7.1.2. Egress training.
     6.7.1.3. Emergency procedures training.
  6.7.2. Observer in MEGP Passenger Status. Designated contractor personnel may observe AMC
  flight activities on operational cross-country and overwater missions. Except in rare cases, contractor
  personnel are required to remain with their home station departure aircrew. EXCEPTION: Mission
  reroute to sensitive or possible hostile areas, diplomatic restrictions, etc. In such cases, contractor
  MEGP may join an AMC aircraft mission enroute to home station or return at contractor expense.
  Contractor personnel in this status will not be allowed access to aircraft controls nor shall they occupy
  a primary crew position. HQ AMC/DO will approve transportation authorization for contractor
  instructors. These individuals will have in their possession a copy of the transportation authorization
  and will be listed as MEGP on the travel orders. MEGP approval does not fulfill the requirements of
  the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), nor constitute theater clearance.
  6.7.3. Contractor Medical Examinations and Toxicological Testing. Contractor designated flight per-
  sonnel are subject to medical examination and toxicological testing if involved in an aircraft mishap.
  Contractor personnel will also provide written statements and other information relating to the mishap
  as required by the mishap investigator. Contractor statements are protected under the privileged, lim-
  ited use provisions of AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. In no case will the USAF be
  charged or held liable for loss of productivity by contractor personnel due to mission diversions,
  delays, or cancellations.
  6.7.4. Flight Authorization Orders and Flight Time Log. AMC contractor instructors flying as
  observer aircrew members on local flights shall be designated “ACM” in the crew position column of
  the flight authorization order, and log “XA” in the duty position column. Individuals in non-aircrew
  member status will not log time on the AFTO Form 781, AFORM Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
  Document.

A2.6. Mission-Specific (M) Training Events. M001 Sortie
 M010 Local Proficiency Sortie. The following requirements are listed by crew position:
 Pilots: Must be accomplished with an IP (formal school instructors are exempt from the IP require-
 ment). IPs should accomplish their M010 requirements with another IP on board the aircraft. IPs
 and MPs may complete an LPS over a series of flights, if accomplished in a training quarter. Once
 the exercise commences, it should not be disrupted for any other type of training. 1.5 hours should
  be scheduled for this event. As a minimum, a pilot proficiency sortie will consist of the following:
    Review of boldface emergency procedures
    Three instrument approaches
    Missed approach
    VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting)
    Review of a specific (squadron determined) aircraft system
60                                                                    AFI11-2C-9V1 1 JANUARY 1999

     Simulated engine-out go-around or missed approach (weather permitting, not applicable to copilots
     unless in FP upgrade)
     Partial flap landing
 If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie, credit may be taken after a second IP-supervised
 sortie, provided the combined activity fulfills the intent of this paragraph. Instructors should tailor each
 M010 to the individual pilot’s needs. Particular emphasis should be placed on simulated systems mal-
 functions, simulated-engine out operations and instrument procedures.
 Other aircrew positions: Log basic sorties on local or operational missions that include
 appropriate pre-mission planning, preflight according to flight publications, preparation of perfor-
 mance, takeoff and landing data, weather and crew or passenger briefings, flight plan filing, and
 post-mission procedures. Two aircrew members may log a sortie on the same sortie if the require-
 ments of a Basic Sortie are met.
 M020 Unit Specific Training Sortie. Unit defined sortie to accomplish mission specific training
 events. The following is a suggested listing of events that can be used on a M020:
     Any individual training event (approaches, landings)

 P280 Aircrew Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training (ACDTQT) (for equipped units).
 An exercise emphasizing hands-on training, dressed out in partial chemical defense (CD) ensemble.
 The purpose of the exercise is to enable aircrew members to become aware of their limitations
 while wearing the equipment. Complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited
 dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during the exercise. Observers
 must closely monitor aircrew member actions during the exercise. If an aircrew member experiences
 difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, hyperventilation, headaches, etc., and either the observer
 or aircrew member believes it is unsafe to continue, the equipment will be immediately removed.
 The following aircrew CD items will be used: AERPS gear and Glove set cotton, butyl, Nomex“.
ACDTQT should be accomplished in a simulator with visual displays, provided a simulator exists or
is available. If accomplished in a simulator, ATS instructors will observe the exercise, no other super-
vision is required, and no restrictions apply on who and how many aircrew members may wear the gear.
 The pilot will be supervised by an instructor pilot occupying the other seat and only one pilot may
 wear the gear at one time. A safety aircrew member will occupy the jump seat. Pilots will don the
 gear and accomplish at least one take-off, approach, and landing, and complete all crew position
 checklists associated with approach and landing.
 Prior to this event, each aircrew member must have completed LS04 and LS08, including LS05 criteria.

                           AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A3.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training documentation.
Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form 4023, Aircrew Train-
ing Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Training Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025, Sum-
mary and Close-out Report, and aircrew training guides (TG).
   A3.1.1. Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022, for AFCAT 36-2223 formal training (either at for-
   mal school or in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit
   upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at formal school
   or in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.
      A3.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if corrective
      action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who evaluated
      the aircrew member’s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training deficiency on AF
      Form 4023 or the training guide. Use the existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations
      that result in additional training.
      A3.1.1.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more
      than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF Form
      4022; e.g., a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to AC may have his or her mission upgrade
      combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
   A3.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee's gaining unit.
   Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and enter appropriate comments on
   the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.
   A3.1.3. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily accessi-
   ble to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
   A3.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF Forms 4023 and 4024
   or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously accomplished or those
   in which aircrew members require additional training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the
   current training period. Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and flight
   commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review. Monthly and quar-
   terly reviews will be annotated on AF Form 4023 or in the training guide.
   A3.1.5. Upon completion of training, place the summary/closeout report (AF Form 4025) in the indi-
   vidual's flight evaluation folder (FEF) or in a permanent training folder, as specified in MAJCOM
   supplement. PACAF and USAFE: after one year, training offices will retain the AF Form 4025
   in the aircrew members training folder (AF Form 4022). Refer to AFMAN 37-139, Records Dis-
   position Schedule, for further guidance. Squadrons will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents for 1 year,
   then return to them to the aircrew member. Do not insert AF Forms 4022, 4023, or 4024 or training
   guides into FEFs.
   A3.1.6. If training guides are not used, AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be used for ATS and for-
   mal school courses.

     AFI 37-160, Volume 8, The Air Force Publications and Forms Management Program - Developing
     and Processing Forms. Unit overprints must be approved by appropriate MAJCOM (for AMC and
     AMC-gained AFRC units, HQ AMC/DOT is the approval authority).
     A3.1.8. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the unit should
     be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be considered all training con-
     ducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or artificial training device.

        areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended specific study areas
        for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training period. When the trainee attains
        sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites for upgrade, the instructor will recommend an
        evaluation and state: "Recommend evaluation for (crew position)" on the training progress
        record. Trainees will not be recommended for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete
        or requires corrective action.
        A3.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart (AC for
        copilots) will accomplish required training for those areas not requiring an instructor. Annotate
        applicable training information in the TG.
        A3.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed and addi-
        tional training is required, the flight commander will annotate deficient areas on reproduced pages
        of the appropriate TG and training progress record. This TG insert will be placed in the AF Form
        4022 and used to document completion of additional training.
        A3.6.3.5. At the conclusion of training, when all requirements of the TG are met, fill-out an AF
        Form 4025 in accordance with paragraph A3.5. Maintain the completed TG and associated AF
        Form 4025 in a training folder according to paragraph A3.1.5.
        A3.6.3.6. Do not maintain the training guide in the flight evaluation folder.
     A3.6.4. Review Procedures.
