             1.2.5.14.1.2. Possible solutions or specific assistance required will be included.
             1.2.5.14.1.3. MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls or
             LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
          1.2.5.14.2. Squadron training shortfalls occur and will be reported, when required
          mission training tasks are not accomplished due to shortages of equipment, ARMS
          software, etc. Example: If a squadron is unable to accomplish actual sensor
          employment due to a shortage of training sensors.
          1.2.5.14.3. LIMFACs are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
          effectiveness. Example: If a squadron's ability to accomplish actual sensor
          employment is limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to employ sensor
          equipment. LIMFACs may also include lack of support hardware and/or software.
          1.2.5.14.4. All deviations from these training requirements, after prorating, will be
          reported to ACC/A3. This includes requirements waived by Operations Group
          Commander (OG/CC).           Training reports will be emailed to appropriate
          MAJCOM/RAP program manager(s).
      1.2.5.15. Submit ACC RAP training reports every four months not later than 31 May, 30
      Sep and 31 Jan to cover and report on the periods Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec,
      respectively.
          1.2.5.15.1. Reporting will be IAW ACC/A3C guidance.
          1.2.5.15.2. In lieu of RAP reports, ACC Formal Training (TF-coded) Units (FTUs)
          will submit Status of Formal Training reports.
          1.2.5.15.3. RAP/FTU briefings should be submitted via e-mail to ACC/A3CR
          (acc.a3yr@langley.af.mil).
   1.2.6. Individual crewmembers will:
      1.2.6.1. Hand-carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
      qualifications and training requirements.
      1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
      guidelines of this volume.
      1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are
      qualified, current and prepared or properly supervised.
1.3. Training. Crewmember training is designed to progress a crewmember from Initial
Qualification Training (IQT), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and finally to
Continuation Training (CT). Training limitations times are listed in Table 1.1.

Note:
1. Training time begins with first significant training event. (i.e. ground training/flight
training.)
2. Any events not accomplished in MQT and/or waived, should be accomplished by the
gaining unit.
3. Differences training programs should be developed by operational units to train crew
members in different systems/tactics within the same aircraft series.
     1.3.1. IQT. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers in a basic
     aircraft position and flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. IQT is usually
     accomplished at a Formal Training Unit (FTU). There are provisions within this instruction
     to accomplish IQT in non-FTUs, if the situation necessitates. Note: After successful
     completion of the qualification flight evaluation (an element of the IQT program)
     crewmembers are considered in Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a
     temporary qualification and is not specifically (or necessarily) documented, as such.
     Crewmembers are usually documented as in IQT or MQT status while in BAQ status. BAQ
     is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any crewmember to remain in
     BAQ status is ACC/A3.
     1.3.2. MQT. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify
     crewmembers in a specific position and duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific
     unit. Crewmembers maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Following completion
     of IQT and MQT (or formal instructor upgrade program), crewmembers will have received
     training in all the basic missions of a specific unit, unless otherwise stated in Chapter 3 of
     this instruction. Crewmembers will then be assigned to either a Combat Mission Ready
     (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) position. Note: Progression from BAQ to
     CMR/BMC status requires a Mission (MSN) evaluation IAW AFI 11-2MC-12WV2, MC-
     12W Crew Evaluation Criteria.
     1.3.3. Continuation Training (CT).
        1.3.3.1. CT is the training program for CMR/BMC-designated crew-members and is
        designed to maintain a minimum level of proficiency and/or to increase the capability of
        individual crewmembers.
            1.3.3.1.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
                1.3.3.1.1.1. CMR     requirements   are     typically    more   robust    than     BMC
                requirements.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                             9


          1.3.3.1.1.2. Minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient
          in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
          1.3.3.1.1.3. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1
          positions and flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions.
          OG/CCs may designate other API-6/8 positions not assigned to the flying
          squadron as CMR. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect
          to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR
          and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to API-1
          inexperienced crewmembers and at least 50% of the front line positions will be
          filled with inexperienced crewmembers, if available (ANG: any crewmember may
          be designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion).
          1.3.3.1.1.4. CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core
          missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR
          crewmembers must maintain currency in all core designated flight training, sorties
          and events and all mission ground training which affect CMR status.
          1.3.3.1.1.5. Non-CMR (N-CMR). Failure to complete CMR training or maintain
          these currencies results in regression to N-CMR status unless waived by
          appropriate authority. While N-CMR, pilots may perform missions (including
          exercises and contingencies) and events in which they are current and qualified at
          the discretion of the SQ/CC. Crewmembers that regress to N-CMR status will
          accomplish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.8 and 4.11
       1.3.3.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
          1.3.3.1.2.1. The minimum training required to be familiar with all (and may be
          qualified and proficient in some) of the primary missions tasked to their assigned
          unit and weapons system.
          1.3.3.1.2.2. All active duty wing crewmember positions that are not designated
          CMR positions, are BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned to
          crewmembers that have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff
          functions that directly support the flying operation. FTU/ USAF Weapons School
          (USAFWS) instructors and operational test crewmembers are also assigned BMC
          status.
          1.3.3.1.2.3. BMC crewmembers maintain familiarization with all unit core
          missions. They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the
          unit core missions. For those missions in which they maintain familiarization
          only, BMC crewmembers must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in
          30 days or less. BMC crewmembers must accomplish all mission-related ground
          training designated by their assigned SQ/CC.
          1.3.3.1.2.4. BMC crewmembers may deploy and participate in any mission for
          which they are proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined
          by the SQ/CC.
          1.3.3.1.2.5. Non-BMC (N-BMC). Failure to complete BMC required training
          results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will
 10                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


              determine missions the crew-members may perform and supervision required.
              Crewmembers that regress to N-BMC status will accomplish the requirements in
              accordance with paragraph 4.8
          1.3.3.1.3. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills
          that are not required by every crewmember but are necessary to carry out the unit's
          assigned missions.      Specialized training is normally accomplished after a
          crewmember is assigned CMR/BMC status.                  Unless otherwise specified,
          crewmembers in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications
          as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.
      1.3.3.2. There are two aspects of CT: Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) and non-RAP
      training requirements.
          1.3.3.2.1. RAP requirements are designed to focus training on capabilities needed to
          accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Types of training sorties and events are unit
          specific and established by the MAJCOM and unit commander. Specifics are
          contained in the RAP Tasking Message (RTM). RAP requirements are annotated in
          Table 1.2
          1.3.3.2.2. Non-RAP training requirements ensure skills are maintained to safely and
          proficiently operate unit aircraft and associated equipment. These requirements apply
          to all MC-12W units and generally do not change. Non-RAP sorties and events are
          contained in Table 4.2
1.4. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.4.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, crewmember capabilities and safety.                This
   instruction/volume provides training guidelines and policies for use with operational
   procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications.
   1.4.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC/TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training
   program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and
   tasked to ACC/TRSS. Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade
   operation test crewmembers in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved
   by the TEG/CC and submitted to ACC/TRSS.
   1.4.3. Training missions will be designed to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions will emphasize basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence and opposition
   capabilities. Tactical training will include on-board mission equipment, threat simulators and
   countermeasures.
   1.4.4. In-flight Supervision: Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of
   supervision necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor is
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                11


  required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor from a like crew
  position when performing aircrew duties.
     1.4.4.1. All non-current aircrew members. Aircrew members’ non-current in an event
     may fly a mission without supervision by an instructor or squadron supervisor (as
     applicable) provided:
         1.4.4.1.1. Expected flight conditions provide reasonable certainty that performance
         of the non-current event will not be required in order to conduct that particular flight
         or mission.
         1.4.4.1.2. Flight is approved by applicable authority IAW AFI 11-202V3, General
         Flight Rules, and local directives. Note: The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible
         for, and is the final authority as to the operation of the aircraft.
     1.4.4.2. All aircrew members in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying
     training.
         1.4.4.2.1. Qualified members in instructor upgrade training are not considered UQ
         and will maintain their applicable pre-upgrade qualification status throughout upgrade
         training (paragraph 5.5). Events accomplished in training may update currencies, but
         are not creditable as RAP events.
     1.4.4.3. Unqualified crewmembers and senior officers as defined in AFI 11-202V1,
     Aircrew Training and any other staff personnel the WG, OG, or SQ/CCs designate as
     required to fly with an instructor.
         1.4.4.3.1. For unqualified, non-current, or senior officer pilots, the instructor pilot
         must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight, or when an individual is
         regaining currency or qualification in specific events.
     1.4.4.4. Training events as specified in AFI 11-2-MC-12WV3, Chapter 9.
  1.4.5. Evaluator Usage. Units may use evaluators as instructors for qualification and
  upgrade training. If an evaluator is used as a primary instructor to train an individual, the
  same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation.
  1.4.6. Every attempt should be made to ensure instructor continuity for crewmembers in
  initial mission qualification, requalification, difference training and upgrade training.
  Students should not have more than three different instructors in a course. If the number of
  instructors exceeds three, document the fact with a memo for record in the individual’s
  training folder. Note: Squadron commanders, operations officers and SO/CO Ops Sups and
  Chiefs will not be included in this limitation.
  1.4.7. Crewmembers will not be required to accomplish ground and/or ancillary training
  except as required by this instruction or AFI 36-2201, Volume 1, Training Development,
  Delivery and Evaluation.
  1.4.8. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
  qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In
  some instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another
  to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification
  requirements may be waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in
 12                                                    AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


   the conversion program action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action
   directive, the following conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew
   qualification.
      1.4.8.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be
      formed to begin aircrew conversion. Converting units will send proposed initial cadre list
      by name, rank, current crew position and aircraft, total flying time and requested crew
      qualification level through channels to HQ ACC/A3.
      1.4.8.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held.
      For example, HC-130 IP to MC-12W Mission Commander IP. Appropriate comments
      will be entered in the remarks section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual’s status as
      initial cadre instructor or flight examiner. Wavier authority rest with ACC/A3
      1.4.8.3. Following final approval, a squadron letter will be published to identify initial
      cadre instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each
      cadre individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF).
   1.4.9. Instructor Training.
      1.4.9.1. All squadron instructors will be CMR. Attached instructors may maintain BMC
      status with approval of the SQ/CC.
1.5. Experienced Aircrew Requirements.
   1.5.1. Experienced (EXP) Crewmembers must meet the following criteria:
      1.5.1.1. Pilots: 400 hours (hrs) total time and 200 hrs Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI).
      1.5.1.2. Aircraft Commanders: 800 hrs total time, 200 hrs PAI and 100 hrs as Aircraft
      Commander.
      1.5.1.3. Sensor Operators (SOs)/Cryptologic Operator (COs): 200 hrs PAI.
   1.5.2. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, requirements for 200 hrs PAI may be decreased to 100
   hrs PAI for pilots previously experienced in other light multiengine Intelligence, Surveillance
   and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, or for SOs/COs previously experienced operating
   similar equipment on like missions.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management.
   1.6.1. MC-12W units are considered Low-Supply/High-Demand (LSHD) and are not aligned
   against a specific AEF pair. Therefore, the RAP training period is aligned with a 12-month
   cycle, in order to best prepare for high operations tempo outside the normal AEF cycle. The
   12-month training cycle runs from 1 October through 30 September. Units will reference
   their MAJCOM RAP tasking message for specified training cycle and reporting procedures.
   1.6.2. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number and type of RAP missions,
   plus specific weapons delivery/sensor qualifications as determined by MAJCOM and unit
   commanders. The breakout of sorties and mission types is provided as a guideline.
   1.6.3. Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC.
   Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance
   and the individual’s capabilities.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                13


   1.6.4. An effective RAP or training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile
   or a building block type mission. Each profile or mission requires successfully completing a
   significant portion of the events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC
   and Attachment 2.
   1.6.5. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated crewmembers to CMR.
   1.6.6. CMR status requirements.
      1.6.6.1. 1-month look-back at the CMR mission rate.
      1.6.6.2. Qualification in all core missions and sensor events required at CMR.
      1.6.6.3. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated
      number of sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.6.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification.
      1.6.6.5. SQ/CC certification.
   1.6.7. Special Certifications or Qualifications.     SQ/CCs will determine and assign
   crewmembers that will train for and maintain special certifications or qualifications. Special
   certifications/qualification sortie and event requirements are normally accomplished in
   addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements.
   1.6.8. CMR and BMC (wing-level and below) crewmembers will fly the required monthly
   mission rate. If they are unable to maintain this mission rate the rules of Regression will
   apply.
   1.6.9. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the crewmembers experience level
   and qualifications on the last day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.10. Units converting to another Mission Design Series (MDS) may fly crewmembers in
   CMR positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if CMR
   mission rates cannot be supported. CMR crewmembers should be flown at a CMR rate for
   the month prior to IOC. Active duty wings converting to new MDS are authorized one SQ-
   equivalent of additional API-6s during the conversion period. However, total wing staff
   flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage.
1.7. RAP Training Mission Program Development.
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR
   and BMC crewmembers as well as those individuals carrying special capabilities or
   qualifications and are IAW the RAP tasking message. The requirements in Table 1.2
   establish the minimum number of sortie/missions per training cycle for BMC and CMR
   levels of training. The current RTM takes precedence over this volume and may contain an
   updated sortie requirement or missions, events and currencies not incorporated in Table 1.2,
   Table 1.3, Table 4.2, Table 5.1 and or in Attachment 2.

   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements, missions and events designed to ensure maintenance of basic
   crew-member skills are in addition to RAP requirements. Crewmembers may log non-RAP
   events on RAP sorties provided there is no effect on RAP sortie effectiveness. Unit flying
   hour programs contain sorties for crewmembers to accomplish their minimum non-RAP
   requirements.
   1.7.3. Collateral or cost-of-business mission requirements will be considered when
   developing unit flying hour programs. These missions do not directly relate to combat
   employment or basic skills training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit
   operations. Functional check flights and aerial demonstration support are in this category.
   RAP training does not require these sorties.
   1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs contain a number of attrition sorties that compensate for
   non-effective training sorties. Log a non-effective sortie when valid training for a planned
   RAP or non-RAP training mission due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to allocate
   accurate numbers of attrition sorties to unit flying hour programs, it is essential that units
   appropriately log non-effective sorties.
1.8. Training Records and Reports.
   1.8.1. A training folder will be initiated for all qualification, upgrade and additional training
   directed by the squadron commander or a flight examiner.
      1.8.1.1. The training folder will include approved Air Force forms for all training
      reports, other approved reports, all certifications, waivers and other applicable records
      unit training managers require to establish a historical record of an individual’s ability
      and performance.
      1.8.1.2. The training documents will be placed in reverse chronological order with the
      most recent on top.
      1.8.1.3. The SQ/CC or designated representative will conduct a review of active training
      folders prior to any flight evaluation required for training program completion. Annotate
      the review in the student’s folder.
      1.8.1.4. Instructors will review training folders prior to each training period (flight or
      simulator) to develop a training plan. After each period, instructors will document
      training in sufficient detail to accurately assess student performance and make
      recommendations for subsequent training.

      1.9.2.6. Flight discipline/Crew Resource Management/Crew Coordination.
      1.9.2.7. Tactical employment.
1.10. Crewmember Utilization Policy.
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group crewmembers (API-1/6,A/B) fill authorized
   positions IAW unit manning documents and that crewmember status is properly designated.
   The overall objective is that crewmembers are capable of performing combat-related duties.
   Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap
   board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of
   crewmember tasking, flying proficiency, currency and experience. For inexperienced
   aircrew in the first year of their initial operational assignment, supervisors should limit non-
   flying duties to those related to combat activities.
   1.10.2. Commanders must ensure that MC-12W crewmembers assigned duties are
   commensurate with their level of assignment (for an additional duty).
      1.10.2.1. Units may assign the following duties as required by various AFI’s and
      MAJCOM directives to CAF squadron-level crewmembers.
          1.10.2.1.1. Tactics officer.
          1.10.2.1.2. Scheduler.
          1.10.2.1.3. Flying safety officer.
          1.10.2.1.4. Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
          1.10.2.1.5. Mobility and contingency plans officer.
          1.10.2.1.6. Training officer (except ARMS documentation).
          1.10.2.1.7. SQ Stan/Eval liaison officer.
          1.10.2.1.8. Other duties directly related to flying operations.
          1.10.2.1.9. Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) as applicable to the unit.
      1.10.2.2. Squadron-assigned MC-12W crewmembers should not be attached to wing or
      group staffs or man wing or group staff positions with squadron-assigned MC-12W
      crewmembers unless total wing, group and squadron MC-12W dictates. In some
      instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, units may attach squadron-
      assigned MC-12W crewmembers to the wing.
      1.10.2.3. Commanders (CCs) will assure wing-and-above staff crewmembers perform
      duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and fill positions authorized
      in UMDs.
   1.10.3. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties (on going accident/safety
   investigation board member duties, etc…) which detract from their primary duties of training
   for, or performing, the unit flying mission.
1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                              17


  1.11.1. In general, inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over
  experienced crewmembers. Crewmember experience level definitions are in paragraph 1.5.
  Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows.
     1.11.1.1. Formal Training (TF-Coded) Units.
         1.11.1.1.1. Formal syllabus training.
         1.11.1.1.2. Instructor Upgrade Training.
         1.11.1.1.3. Instructor CT.
         1.11.1.1.4. Authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Stan/Eval Flight
         Examiner (SEFE) duties.
     1.11.1.2. Operational (CC-Coded) Units.
         1.11.1.2.1. Squadron-assigned CMR.
         1.11.1.2.2. Squadron-assigned MQT.
         1.11.1.2.3. Wing-assigned CMR.
         1.11.1.2.4. Wing-assigned MQT.
         1.11.1.2.5. Wing-assigned BMC.
     1.11.1.3. Test (CB-coded) Units.
         1.11.1.3.1. Requirements directed by MAJCOM.
         1.11.1.3.2. Training required to prepare for assigned projects and tasking.
         1.11.1.3.3. BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary
         missions.
  1.11.2. Wing API-6/B authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
  1.11.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following
  crew-members will maintain MC-12W instructor status:
     1.11.3.1. WG/CC.
     1.11.3.2. WG/CV.
     1.11.3.3. OG/CC.
     1.11.3.4. OG/CD.
  1.11.4. For FTU-only wings, all API-6 crewmembers will maintain instructor status
  (optional for WG/CC, OG/CC and FCF crews). FTU-only wings will fly API-1/6
  crewmembers as required by programmed flying training (PFT).
  1.11.5. API-8/D rated personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and
  MAJCOM guidance. Above-Wing-Level and test unit crewmembers will fly the BMC rate;
  however, are not required to complete BMC-specific missions and events or meet monthly
  look-back requirements. They will accomplish non-RAP requirements within their BMC
  number of sorties. Units should provide assigned crewmembers adequate resources to
  maintain minimum training requirements; however, the support will not come at the expense

   of the flying squadron's primary mission. API 6/8/B/D flyers will strive to accomplish non-
   RAP requirements with allotted BMC sorties. If units cannot meet attached crewmember
   requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, MAJCOM Supplement. Units
   requiring flying hour adjustments for attached crewmembers must request program changes
   IAW MAJCOM instructions.
   1.11.6. -(ANG: N/A) There is no maximum sortie count for CMR crewmembers. Table 1.3
   defines the minimum and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers. On
   occasion, unique operations may require crewmembers to fly more than the maximum
   number of sorties authorized, however, this may impact training of other crewmembers.
   Crewmembers assigned or attached to ACC Office of the Inspector General (ACC/IGS) as
   API-6/B will maintain RAP currencies/look-back per API-8/D guidance.

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of crewmembers into the
   MC-12W. IQT includes Basic Training (B-Course), Re-qualification Training (TX) and
   Senior Officer Training.
   2.1.2. IQT will normally be conducted during a formal syllabus course at an FTU.
   2.1.3. When FTU training is not available, pilots may complete an FAA-approved King Air
   350 commercial training course, followed by an in-unit initial qualification differences
   training as specified by the SQ/CC. An FAA-approved commercial training course shall
   consist of aircraft general systems, normal/abnormal/emergency procedures and flight
   simulation. The flight simulations should allow pilots 50% time in both seats. The training
   is considered complete upon satisfactory completion of an end of course FAA equivalent
   evaluation. Completion of an FAA type rating is not required. The MC-12W program
   currently uses a civilian contractor, Flight Safety International, to provide initial qualification
   and recurring training for pilots. The Sensor Operator receives Initial Qualification
   training/familiarization at Wiley Post Airport, Bethany, Oklahoma utilizing Cessna C-208
   Beechcraft B-200 aircraft. A civilian contractor, ValAir, provides all academic and flight
   training. The Cryptologic Operator receives Initial Qualification academic and flight training
   at Key Field ANGB, Meridian, MS.
   2.1.4. IQT Programs will be based upon the syllabus tracks, flow programs, sorties and
   events required in the Pilot, Sensor and Cryptologic Operator and specific AFSC Training
   Courses.
   2.1.5. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading crewmember to complete an
   evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MC-12WV2.
   2.1.6. The minimum level experience standard for entering the MC-12W program as an
   Aircraft Commander (Mission Commander) will be: (1) current or previously qualified
   multi-engine A/C or (2) current or previously qualified multi-engine pilot with 800 hours
   total; (3) current or previously qualified 2 ship flight lead (fighter) with 500 total hours; or
   (4) First Assignment Instructor Pilots with 500 total hours.
2.2. Approval/Waiver for Local or Contractor IQT.
   2.2.1. HQ ACC/A3 is the approval authority to conduct local or contractor IQT and is
   waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally/contractor conducted IQT.
   Coordinate approval/waiver requests for local and contractor IQT programs through HQ
   ACC/A3C.
   2.2.2. HQ ACC/A3 is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT for Colonel-Selects
   and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.3. Requests to conduct local or contractor led IQT will include the following.
 20                                                  AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


      2.2.3.1. Justification for the local or contractor-led training in lieu of formal course
      training.
      2.2.3.2. Summary of individual’s flying experience.
      2.2.3.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
      2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW AFI 11-202V1, this instruction, the
appropriate formal course syllabus and Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcements (ACC Syllabus Course MC-12W). Individuals arriving at the FTU without all
prerequisites met or waived may be denied entry into training until the prerequisites are
completed.
2.4. Ground Training.
   2.4.1. Ground training may be tailored to an individual’s background and experience.
   Available and current reference materials such as Air Force Tactics, Techniques and
   Procedures (AFTTP), instructor guides and audiovisual programs as supporting materials
   will be used to the maximum extent possible.
   2.4.2. Simulator missions in an MC-12W Aircrew Training Device (ATD) will be
   accomplished, if available.
      2.4.2.1. If an MC-12W ATD is not available, aircrew may complete training in a
      commercially available B-300 or B-350 series equivalent ATD.
      2.4.2.2. Based on availability use an approved Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) and/or
      cockpit familiarization trainer (CFT) to the maximum extent possible.
      2.4.2.3. Part-Task Trainer, or Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT) may be used if an
      OFT/CFT is not available.
2.5. Flying Training.
   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be based upon required events from the
   appropriate formal course syllabus.
   2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the approved syllabus.
   Failure to complete within the specified time limit requires notification through appropriate
   channels to the OG/CC and ACC/A3C with crewmember’s name, rank, reason for delay,
   planned actions and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Crewmembers will fly under instructor supervision until completing the initial
   qualification (QUAL) check ride.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements. The
   SQ/CC may authorize incorporation of additional training events into the program, based on
   student proficiency and background. Additional training due to student non-progression is
   available within the constraints of the course syllabus. SQ/CCs may add discretionary
   additional training sorties as required.
   2.5.5. Crewmembers in IQT will not fly in ―Flag‖ exercises, Weapons School support
   deployments, Weapon Systems Evaluation Programs, or equivalent type exercises.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                            21


2.6. IQT for Senior Officers.
   2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (Colonel-selects and above) will be
   conducted at the FTU and IAW the Senior Officer Qualification Training Course Syllabus
   found at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2
   2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW Senior Officer Qualification Training Course Syllabus.

                                         Chapter 3

                        MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. The ACC Syllabus Course for the MC-12W is considered an MQT formal training
   course and will conclude with a mission (MSN) flight evaluation. Unit-developed and
   administered training programs to certify a crewmember CMR/ BMC are also considered a
   part of MQT. Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist unit CCs in developing an MQT
   program.
   3.1.2. Individuals should complete MQT training within 180 days of completing IQT
   training. Training will culminate with a mission evaluation IAW AFI11-MC-12WV2,
   resulting in qualification as either a mission commander, mission co-pilot, mission SO, or
   mission CO. A unit-administered MQT program requires OG/CC approval (a copy of local
   MQT training programs will be forwarded to the MAJCOM).
   3.1.3. Units may tailor the program for each crewmember based on experience, currency,
   documented performance and formal training.
   3.1.4. Sorties and events for a unit-administered MQT program will be based on the
   unaccomplished portion of ACC Syllabus Course MC-12W and additional events and/or
   sorties needed to qualify a crewmember in the unit-specific mission and TTPs.
   3.1.5. Units will ensure events not accomplished in MQT are completed or waived before
   the individual is certified BMC or CMR. The gaining SQ/CC must approve any items
   waived or not accomplished in MQT.
   3.1.6. MQT will normally be completed within 90 days of the individual’s start of MQT
   training. If training time exceeding 90 days requires SQ/CC approval. MQT training is
   complete upon evaluation and SQ/CC certification to BMC/CMR.
   3.1.7. Crewmembers in MQT will not fly in ―Flag‖ exercises, Weapons School support
   deployments, Weapon Systems Evaluation Programs, or equivalent type exercises.
   3.1.8. Prior to CMR certification, crewmembers must initially qualify in all mission and
   sensor events required to be Qualified (QUAL) at CMR.
3.2. Ground Training.
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited toward this
   requirement.
      3.2.1.1. CMR Certification. Crewmembers will complete an initial CMR certification
      brief to the SQ/CC within 90 days after completing MQT. Failure to comply will result
      in regression to N-CMR until the certification is complete.
      3.2.1.2. Initial Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Defensive Training (INBCDT).
      The MC-12W is not configured to conduct operations in an NBC environment.
      Therefore, the NBC training requirement for MC-12W aircrew may be determined by the
      flying unit or as directed by the RAP tasking message.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                               23


      3.2.1.3. MC-12W entry/exit/emergency egress procedures.
3.3. Simulator Training.
   3.3.1. If an OFT is unavailable, MQT simulator requirements may be accomplished in an
   operational MC-12W aircraft. Operational aircraft may also be used to accomplish
   appropriate switchology and emergency procedures training based upon the availability of
   OFT’s and/or aircraft. MQT crewmembers should fly training device mission profiles that
   replicate wartime tasking. Training device mission will include selected critical action
   emergency procedures, spatial disorientation, channelized attention and unusual
   attitude/inadvertent weather entry procedures.
   3.3.2. MQT OFT Event Requirements.
      3.3.2.1. Instruments and Emergency Procedures (EPs).           Personal and mission
      preparation, normal ground operations, flight operations, navigation and published to
      home base and any specified alternate, partial panel instrument approaches, post-flight
      ground operations, Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) and selected non-CAPs EPs will

  4.2.1. Ground training requirements are IAW Table 4.1 and the RTM. Waiver authority for
  the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. Ground training accomplished
  during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it
  was accomplished. Table 4.1 is a reference for crewmembers ground training only. This
  table does not include all Air Force ancillary training, which will also be tracked at unit level.
  Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Chapter 5 contains
  upgrade training programs with both flying and ground training requirements.
  4.2.2. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). IRC will be completed IAW AFMAN 11-210,
  Instrument Refresher Course Program; AFI 11-202V2; and MAJCOM supplements.
  4.2.3. Aircrew Training Device (ATD).
     4.2.3.1. Units will determine additional CT training device requirements based on
     expected employment tasking, training device capabilities and mission training
     objectives. Units will determine appropriate supervision levels for ATD missions/tasks.
     Units will track all aircrew device training used to satisfy RAP and non-RAP
     requirements.
     4.2.3.2. Units will develop scenarios that cover CAPs, Emergency Procedures (EPs),
     instrument approach procedures and other scenario requirements based on expected
     employment tasking and training device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on
     training not readily attainable during daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios
     annually and update as required. Unusual attitude and inadvertent weather entry
     procedures training and unusual attitude recovery training will be accomplished during
     all instrument or emergency procedure ATD training.
     4.2.3.3. Tactical (TAC) EP, missions will be accomplished in an OFT, if available. If a
     unit does not have access to an OFT, EP and operational missions will be accomplished
     in the best ATD available.
         4.2.3.3.1. EP OFT.
             4.2.3.3.1.1. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight EPs and maintain proficiency
             in applying aircraft general knowledge to abnormal situations.
             4.2.3.3.1.2. Specific Mission Tasks:       Unusual attitude recoveries, spatial
             disorientation, inadvertent weather entry, controlled flight departure recognition
             and recovery procedures, CAPs, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures,
             in-flight EPs and instrument procedures.
         4.2.3.3.2. TAC OFT.
             4.2.3.3.2.1. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight malfunctions and maintain
             proficiency in applying tactical knowledge to combat scenarios.

             relevant simulated combat employment, threat recognition and counter tactics,
             sensor malfunction procedures, relevant CAPs and aircraft subsystem failure
             procedures.
  4.2.4. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). This training is not an
  evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency procedures and aircraft systems
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                              27


  operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One crewmember should present a situation
  and another crewmember discusses actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry
  it to a logical conclusion. CAPs and squadron special interest items should be emphasized.
  The following guidelines will be used in development and execution of the SEPT training
  program.
     4.2.4.1. SQ/CC or SQ/DO should provide inputs in the selection of monthly SEPT
     topics.
     4.2.4.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using MC-12W, or other similar aircraft,
     mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
     4.2.4.3. SEPTs should be accomplished in the best ATD available. If an ATD is not
     available, SEPTs should be accomplished as a crew, but small flight-sized groups are
     allowable if all members participate to the full extent and share equal time responding to
     emergency situations.
     4.2.4.4. Discuss at least one EP for each phase of flight during the SEPT session.
     4.2.4.5. Accomplish four supervised SEPTs each training period (with an IP or SQ
     supervisor or experienced aircraft commander, as approved by the SQ/CC).
     4.2.4.6. Accomplish one SEPT each calendar month. Failure to accomplish by the end
     of the month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
     4.2.4.7. The intent of the program is to accomplish 12 SEPTs per calendar year.
     4.2.4.8. Completion of an ATD EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement, if not
     already accomplished.
     4.2.4.9. IPs/supervisors who administer/observe EP ATDs satisfy their monthly SEPT
     requirement.
     4.2.4.10. Formal course student EP/ATDs may be used satisfy the monthly SEPT
     requirement for the IP administering the training.
  4.2.5. Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/tactics academic training
  program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. The program will require successful
  completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Testing will be used to validate
  qualification to the maximum extent possible throughout the training program.
  Crewmembers successfully scoring 85 percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu
  of ground CT, where authorized by the governing publication. Audiovisual/Computer-Based
  Training (CBT) programs may be used in place of academic instruction.
     4.2.5.1. Academic instructors should be USAF Weapons Instructors Course (USAFWIC)
     graduates or have training/operational experience applicable to teach the academic
     portions of MC-12W weapons/tactics employment.
     4.2.5.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but not limited to:
         4.2.5.2.1. Air-to-surface sensors. Description, operation, parameters, limitations,
         preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.

         4.2.5.2.3. AFTTP to include, as a minimum: Volume 1, General Planning and
         Employment Considerations and Volume 2, Threat Reference Guide and Counter-
         tactics.
     4.2.5.3. Specialized training will be developed to support specific missions, sensors,
     tactics, aircraft and aircrew capabilities, authentication, wartime Rules of Engagement
     (ROE)and safe passage procedures and where applicable.
         4.2.5.3.1. Counterland procedures, to include Tactical Air Coordination procedures
         and Overwatch procedures and Support to Special Operations forces with a Forward
         Air Controller-Airborne (FAC-A) and/or Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC).
         4.2.5.3.2. Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) procedures; to include
         Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and dissemination
         procedures.     Restrictions in AFI 11-220, Reconnaissance Flight Rules and

         4.2.5.3.4. Combat operations lessons learned.
         4.2.5.3.5. Theater specific threat reviews.
  4.2.6. Intelligence Training. The intelligence training program will be closely aligned with
  the unit weapons and tactics training program. The focus and extent of academic training
  will be determined by the Unit/CC and be aligned with projected wartime tasking, threats and
  unit equipage. In addition to threat knowledge, crewmember training will include:
     4.2.6.1. Visual Recognition (VR). Crewmembers must be able to:
         4.2.6.1.1. Visually identify aircraft (rotary and fixed-wing, including joint/allied
         assets) they are likely to encounter by name or numerical designator and determine
         whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat.
         4.2.6.1.2. Visually identify major combat ground vehicles and equipment and
         determine friend or foe.
         4.2.6.1.3. Visually identify major categories of naval vessels (if applicable to the
         AOR).
     4.2.6.2. Collection and Reporting (C&R). C&R training will enable crewmembers to
     initiate reports (In-Flight Report [INFLTREP], Communication Instructions Reporting
     Vital Intelligence Sighting [CIRVIS], etc.) and will familiarize them with the information
     requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and Intelligence
     Report (INTREP).
     4.2.6.3. Current Intelligence will also cover significant military/political developments
     (including threat updates), in the squadron’s mission areas of interest. Use guidance
     contained in AFI 14-202 series, MAJCOM Supplements and AFI 11-2MC-12V3, to
     develop and manage unit intelligence training programs. The Unit/CC and Training
     Flight will determine crewmember intelligence testing requirements.
     4.2.6.4. Theater specific OPORDs and directives, as required.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                  29


       4.2.6.5. Theater specific threat systems, capabilities and potential adversary tactics and
       employment doctrine, as required.
   4.2.7. Air Force Anti-terrorism/Force Protection as required IAW AFI 10-245, Air Force

   4.2.8. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). Units will participate in MAJCOM
   established CRM CT. Training builds upon the basic cockpit management skills taught in
   Specialized Undergraduate Pilot training (SUPT) and FTUs. Each crew-member is required
   to participate in one session every 24 months. Training will be tracked in Aviation Resource
   Management System (ARMS). Failure to attend CRM training results in grounding
   (waiverable by OG/CC). Briefings and debriefings will include the core curriculum of CRM
   training IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program and the
   appropriate MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 11-290. The instructor CRM course may be used
   to satisfy the 12 month requirement.
   4.2.9. Enlisted Systems Operator Career Progression Training. Enlisted Systems Operators
   must maintain core competency knowledge, skills and abilities in their enlisted career fields.
   Use assigned Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) or Air Force Job
   Qualification Standard (AFJQS) to develop and manage Systems Operator skill-level and
   continuation training. Failure to maintain career field training progression does not affect
   CMR status.

NOTES: A-Annual, B-Biennial, C-Check Cycle, T-Triennial
1. If in-unit training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, unit is responsible for
ensuring all requirements are completed.
2. Mandatory grounding item after expiration date; individual will not fly until required training
is accomplished. Expires 5-years after the last day of the month in which previously
accomplished.
3. Individuals may be declared CMR without completing event GA01. Complete GA01 not
later than 180-days prior to deployment.
4. Initial training is called S-V80-A or S-V86-A according to AFI 16-1301 see paragraph 2.3.2.
This training is not accomplished at the FTU but should be completed before member arrives at
the gaining unit. If the member arrives at the gaining unit without this training, it should be
scheduled as soon as practical.
5. LL06 should be accomplished in conjunction with SS07, SS02, or SS05 and are mandatory
Grounding items: individuals will not fly until event is accomplished, additionally must be re-
accomplished upon arrival after each permanent change of station.
6. Conducted as a review of the MQT SDP academic briefing.
4.3. Flying Training.
   4.3.1. All crewmembers (except API-8 and ACC/IGS crewmembers) will accomplish the
   requirements in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 as applicable to their crew position and
   qualifications. Failure to accomplish the requirements in Table 4.2 will affect the
   crewmembers currency status and may require additional training as determined by the
   SQ/CC. Failure to accomplish the requirements specified in this paragraph or the RAP
   tasking message may require loss of certification or qualification (recertification or re-
   qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7). In addition, crewmembers must meet the following
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                  31


   requirements (API-8 and ACC/IGS flyers will strive to accomplish the requirements as
   shown in Table 4.2):
   4.3.2. Instrument Flying Training.
       4.3.2.1. Units will develop and implement an instrument flying training program to
       ensure instrument proficiency. Programs will include briefings on recognition and how
       to deal with spatial disorientation, unusual attitude recoveries, transition between visual
       and instrument conditions, weather avoidance and navigation procedures.
       4.3.2.2. Units will also develop theater-specific instrument academic programs for
       inclusion in their pre-deployment spin-up training programs. Units will include a course
       on MC-12W weather operations/limitations and navigation capabilities in their theater-
       specific instrument academic training.
   4.3.3. Pilot Proficiency Sortie (PPS). Crews must maintain a high level of proficiency with
   basic aircraft flight procedures. A PPS is a mission to practice instrument, transition, traffic
   patterns and emergency procedures. Maneuvers will be flown under the direct supervision of
   an IP. An IP should log a PPS with IP supervision, when possible. IPs and EPs are not
   required to fly with another IP to credit this event. All maneuvers will be completed to an
   acceptable level of proficiency as determined by the IP to log the PPS. Should the PPS be
   incomplete for weather, aircraft malfunction, or pilot performance, the instructor will
   determine if the entire PPS will be re-accomplished or just the incomplete events. Instructors
   need not accomplish all the events on a single sortie. The PPS will be credited upon
   completion of the last event. A PPS should be briefed as a standard alternate mission
   whenever possible. As a minimum, a PPS should consist of the following:
       4.3.3.1. Two instrument approaches (one precision and one non-precision if available).
       4.3.3.2. A holding pattern or procedure turn.
       4.3.3.3. Simulated engine-out approach, go-around and landing.
       4.3.3.4. A Circling Approach (traffic permitting).
       4.3.3.5. VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting).
       4.3.3.6. Landings at all flap settings prescribed by the flight manual.
       4.3.3.7. A review of CAPs .
4.4. Aircrew Flight Training/Currency Requirements. MC-12W pilots will accomplish
training/currency requirements during the unit training cycle IAW Table 4.2 and the RTM.
Failure to accomplish required proficiency items will affect currency status as identified in table
4.2 and may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. If any sortie/event from
Table 4.2 is subsequently converted to a RAP requirement in the RTM, failing to accomplish
that requirement may affect CMR/BMC status, as designated. The OG/CC is the wavier
authority for flying training requirements listed in Table 4.1 and 4.2 and the RAP tasking
message.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment:
       4.4.1.1. In addition to events accomplished on training and operational missions, those
       flight events accomplished on a satisfactory qualification, mission qualification,
 32                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


       specialized mission qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited towards
       the individual’s currency requirements and to establish subsequent due dates.
       4.4.1.2. Crewmembers who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight
       evaluation will not log continuation training requirements for events graded Q-3 IAW
       AFI 11-2MC-12W, Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, until re-qualified.
       4.4.1.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training
       period.
       4.4.1.4. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria
       of this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the
       same flight.
       4.4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
       completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
       currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events
       trained to a 3C during qualification/requalification training will use the date of the
       checkride as the initial accomplishment date.
       4.4.1.6. Simulator Credit for Flight Training Events. Crewmembers may credit events
       accomplished in an ATD, certified for the event by lead MAJCOM, unless otherwise
       specified by the respective event description in Attachment 2, Table 4.2, or the RTM.
       No more than 50% of the annual flight training events may be credited. A certified ATD
       may be used to maintain or regain currency in those events.
       4.4.1.7. Instructor and Evaluator Training Requirements and Responsibilities. Instructors
       and flight examiners may credit up to 50% of their annual requirements while instructing
       or evaluating. EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any
       takeoffs, approaches or landings flown by another pilot.

Notes
1. Pilots may dual log this event with Mission Sortie.
2. Aircrew must perform mission specific events from their TTL’s to receive Mission Sortie credit
i.e. FMV or signals related events.
3. Classroom and Simulator training will emphasize aircraft systems, aircrew emergency and
abnormal procedures and CRM. Refresher Simulator training will include a minimum of 4 hours
 34                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


of hands on SIM time. This event is waiverable by the applicable OG/CC for units not co-located
with a SIM.
4.5. Special Categories.
   4.5.1. Flight Surgeon. Flight surgeons may participate in continuation training missions as
   observers. Units will develop appropriate continuation training mission orientation programs
   for assigned flight surgeons.
   4.5.2. Above-Wing-Level Crewmembers (ANG: Responsibilities for API-8/D staff flyers
   are contained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG):
       4.5.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for Above-Wing-Level personnel (other than
       that conducted in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the
       supporting unit. MAJCOM A3Ts are the reviewing authorities for assigned personnel.
       They will:
          4.5.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure maintenance of
          appropriate ARMS data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.5.2.1.2. Review assigned crewmember accomplishments and currencies prior to
          authorizing participation in MDT.
          4.5.2.1.3. Provide each crewmember with written documentation specifying the
          authorized mission types and events the crewmember may fly. Above-Wing-Level
          crewmembers who fly with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit
          commander.
       4.5.2.2. Above-Wing-Level crewmembers maintaining BMC status are exempt from
       academic ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas.
       Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron and squadron supervisors will
       determine crewmember qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT.
       4.5.2.3. Above-Wing-Level crewmembers will.
          4.5.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
          4.5.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation along with currency
          information to the supporting squadron supervisors prior to flying with that squadron.
          4.5.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that they do not
          exceed their ability and proficiency.
       4.5.2.4. With the concurrence of the OG/CC, instructor-qualified crewmembers may
       perform instructor duties provided they have qualification and currency for the applicable
       missions and events.
   4.5.3. Active Duty pilots flying with ANG and AFRC units.
       4.5.3.1. Wing/group air advisor rated personnel on duty with operational training units
       can maintain CMR and may be qualified as an IP and SEFE.
       4.5.3.2. Active duty pilots other than assigned advisors are authorized to fly with ARC
       units IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                  35


       4.5.3.3. Pilots on exchange programs from active duty units are authorized mission
       oriented sorties IAW specific operations plans (OPLAN) that establishes the exchange.
       SQ/CCs may authorize their participation IAW their specific experience and
       qualification.
       4.5.3.4. HHQ staff pilots may participate in tactical training events. Each pilot will
       present documentation summarizing medical status (e.g., AF Form 1042, Medical
       Recommendation for Flying.)
4.6. Multiple Qualifications.
   4.6.1. ACC/A3 may authorize qualification in more than one MDS for crewmembers when
   command mission requirements direct such action and dual qualification is economically
   justifiable. MAJCOMs cannot delegate this authority. Unless required for unit mission
   accomplishment, commanders must not permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission
   aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft. Individuals assigned to positions
   covered by paragraph 4.6.2 have prior ACC/A3 approval and do not need to submit specific
   requests.
       4.6.1.1. Multiple qualification requests will be submitted through command channels to
       ACC/A3. All requests must contain full justification. Units will provide multiple
       qualification approval to the appropriate host base flight management office. Flight
       accomplishments will not be authorized until aircraft assignment is updated in ARMS.
       4.6.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
       remains assigned to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3
       (ANG: NGB/A3).
       4.6.1.3. Multiple qualifications are not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units
       with different types of aircraft. Wing commanders (WG/CCs) will qualify in only one of
       their wing's aircraft. Either the wing vice commander (WG/CV) or OG/CC should
       qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the one selected by the WG/CC).
   4.6.2. SQ/CC must designate in writing crewmembers that will maintain multiple
   qualification and designate a primary (CMR) aircraft. Multiple qualifications are authorized
   as follows and does not require a specific multiple qualification authorization.
       4.6.2.1. Crewmembers assigned to CC-coded units whose PAI include both MC-12W
       and C-12 may maintain BMC status in secondary aircraft provided the secondary aircrafts
       currency requirements are met.
       4.6.2.2. Crewmembers assigned to TF-coded units responsible for IQT and conversion
       training for the MC-12W and C-12 MDS.
       4.6.2.3. Crewmembers assigned to CB-coded units responsible for providing Operational
       Test and Evaluation (OT&E) of the MC-12W and C-12 MDS.
   4.6.3. OG/CC will determine which currencies/events may be satisfied in either MDS and
   which currencies/events must be satisfied in both MDS.
       4.6.3.1. Crewmembers qualified in multiple MDS will fly at least once each 45/30
       (EXP/INEXP) days in each aircraft; all other currencies/events are IAW paragraph
       4.6.3, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3
 36                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


      4.6.3.2. Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will satisfy at least 50 percent of
      their sortie requirements in their primary aircraft. If CMR in more than one MDS, an
      equitable distribution (as determined by OG/CC) of sortie and event requirements will be
      logged.
      4.6.3.3. If dual qualified, crewmembers will fly an equitable distribution (as determined
      by OG/CC) of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations and approaches in
      each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements.
   4.6.4. Crewmembers must complete MDS conversion/qualification training IAW an
   approved syllabus.
4.7. Currency, Recurrency and Requalification.
   4.7.1. Currency/Recurrency. Table 4.2 defines currency requirements for MC-12W
   crewmembers. Aircrew members may not instruct, evaluate or perform any event in which
   they are not qualified and current unless under instructor or supervisor supervision. Currency
   may be established or updated by:
      4.7.1.1. Accomplishing the event as a qualified crew member provided member’s
      currency in the event has not expired.
      4.7.1.2. Accomplishing the event as a qualified crew member under supervision of a
      current instructor or SQ/CC approved squadron supervisor IAW paragraph 1.4.4 Note:
      Instructor Pilots are required to supervise the update of expired pilot currencies as
      required in AFI 11-202V3.
      4.7.1.3. Events satisfactorily performed on any evaluation may be used to establish or
      update currency in that event.
   4.7.2. Training annotated as affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until
   accomplishing appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC. Training identified as not
   affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR, although the deficiency may
   result in grounding until completing training. The duration of grounding and status of sortie
   look-back will determine the effect on CMR status.
   4.7.3. Sortie Recurrency/Requalification. Loss of sortie currency requires the following
   action (timing starts from last sortie):
      4.7.3.1. 45-90 (60-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain sortie currency. Supervision level
      is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie or event.
      4.7.3.2. 91-180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.7.3.1 above, plus instructor supervised
      ATD including:
          4.7.3.2.1. For CMR crewmembers:         Tactics, normal, instrument and emergency
          procedures.
          4.7.3.2.2. For BMC crewmembers: Normal, instrument and emergency procedures.
          4.7.3.2.3. If an ATD is not available training may be accomplished in an MC-12W
          Mission Aircraft.
      4.7.3.3. Aircrew non-current for more than 180-days are unqualified and will complete
      all required training events as directed by the SQ/CC and a flight evaluation IAW AFI
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                37


      11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MC-12WV2. The SQ/CC may authorize a ―SPOT‖ evaluation in
      the applicable non-current areas.
      4.7.3.4. Aircrewmembers unqualified for a period up to 39 months at the end of a non-
      flying assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment. Complete
      training in all delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the
      squadron commander and a flight evaluation.
      4.7.3.5. Unqualified 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the
      end of any active flying assignment or greater complete IQT/MQT formal school flying
      training course and a flight evaluation.
   4.7.4. Instructor Lack of Ability. Instructors serve solely at the discretion of Squadron
   Commanders. Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present
   themselves a reliable and authoritative expert in their respective duty positions. Instructors
   exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor
   duty. Instructors will be decertified if:
      4.7.4.1. Awarded a less than fully qualified grade in any area of a flight evaluation
      regardless of overall crew position qualification.
      4.7.4.2. Failure of a qualification, EPE, or instrument examination.
      4.7.4.3. Unit commander deems instructor is substandard, ineffective, or providing
      incorrect procedures, technique, or policy guidance.
      4.7.4.4. Decertified instructors may regain instructor status by correcting applicable
      deficiency and completing training and/or evaluation as specified by Sq/CC.
4.8. Regression.
   4.8.1. CMR and BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Look-back. Only RAP training, pilot
   proficiency sorties and contingency operations sorties will be used for look-back. If
   crewmembers do not meet look-back requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs
   may regress them to N-CMR or N-BMC status, as applicable, remove them from a CMR
   manning position, or initiate action to remove them from active flying status.
      4.8.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP sortie look-back requires a review of the
      crewmember's 3-month sortie history. If the crewmember meets the 3-month look-back,
      the crewmember may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR or BMC, as applicable.
      4.8.1.2. Failure to meet 3-month RAP sortie look-back will result in regression to N-
      CMR or N-BMC status as appropriate, or the SQ/CC may place the crew-member in
      probation status for 1 month. If the SQ/CC chooses probation, the only way to remove a
      crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month
      look-back at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1)
      4.8.1.3. CMR and BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR or N-BMC for look-back
      must complete a SQ/CC-approved re-certification program to return the crewmember to
      CMR or BMC standards. This re-certification program is developed by the SQ/CC’s
      training representative to reinstate aircrew members to CMR status based on the
      individuals flying profile. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the
      crewmember also must meet the subsequent 1-month look-back requirement prior to
 38                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


      reclaiming CMR or BMC status. Units may credit the sorties and events accomplished
      during the re-certification program toward the individual's total and type sortie and event
      requirements for the training cycle as well as for the monthly sortie requirement.
      4.8.1.4. Look-back computations begin following SQ/CC designation of the
      crewmember to BMC or CMR. The crewmember must maintain 1-month look-back until
      establishing a 3-month look-back. If a new CMR or BMC crewmember fails to meet 1-
      month look-back while establishing 3-month look-back, SQ/CCs may apply probation
      rules as described in paragraph 4.8.1.2 In addition, 1-month look-back starts the first full
      month of CMR or BMC status.
   4.8.2. Regression for Cryptologic Operator Qualification or Sensor Operator. Failure to
   maintain RAP tasked sensor qualification at the end of the training cycle will require:
      4.8.2.1. For events tasked as QUAL at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC
      unless waived by OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC, the crewmember must re-accomplish
      initial qualification in the deficient /sensor/crypto event. Events accomplished for this
      initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at
      the end of the training cycle.
      4.8.2.2. For events tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC unless
      waived by OG/CC.
   4.8.3. Unqualified Crewmember Evaluations. Crewmembers who fail a qualification,
   instrument, or mission flight evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2. Crewmembers
   will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR
   or N-BMC until successfully completing required corrective action, a reevaluation and are
   re-certified by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.4. Failure to Maintain Flying Standards. If a qualified crewmember demonstrates lack of
   proficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC may elect
   to regress the individual to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will
   remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by
   the SQ/CC, an evaluation if required and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
4.9. End of Cycle Requirements.
   4.9.1. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie or event requirements of this volume by the
   end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and
   magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.10 for proration policy guidance. In all
   cases training shortfalls will be reported IAW paragraph 1.2
   4.9.2. Crewmembers who fail to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at
   CMR or BMC as determined by look-back. The SQ/CC will determine if these
   crewmembers require additional training.
   4.9.3. Crewmembers who fail to meet non-RAP sortie or event requirements may continue
   CT at CMR or BMC as determined by look-back. The SQ/CC will determine if these
   crewmembers require additional training.
   4.9.4. Failure to meet RAP Sortie Requirements will result in the following.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                 39


      4.9.4.1. Regression to N-CMR or N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type
      deficiency is significant. To regain CMR or BMC, the crewmember will complete all
      deficient sortie types. Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the
      new training cycle.
      4.9.4.2. Continuation at CMR or BMC if the crewmember maintains total RAP sorties
      and look-back and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies insignificant.
4.10. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.
   4.10.1. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorate all training requirements
   when duty not to include flying (DNIF), emergency leaves, non-flying temporary duty
   (TDY), exercises, contingency operations, or direct combat support preclude training for a
   portion of the training period (ARC: Includes mandatory training required by civilian
   employment). Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability. Units may consider
   extended bad weather that precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days
   as non-availability. ANG and AFRC crewmembers unable to fly during their monthly
   availability period due to weather may prorate one month’s portion of total training cycle
   RAP sorties and events. The following guidelines apply:
      4.10.1.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
      availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
      4.10.1.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying (to include
      post-deployment comp time) during the training cycle. Use Table 4.3 to determine the
      number of months to be prorated based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
      4.10.1.3. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the
      next lower whole number, but no requirement shall be prorated below one.
      4.10.1.4. Consider newly assigned or converted crewmembers and crewmembers
      achieving CMR or BMC status after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of
      the following month for proration purposes. Crewmembers will complete prorated RAP
      sorties/events in CT.
      4.10.1.5. If IQT is re-accomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a
      prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
      4.10.1.6. SQ/CCs may prorate a crewmember's last month on station prior to departing
      permanent change of station (PCS) provided they do not exceed one month's proration.
      Units may consider individuals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days
      from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new
      duty station.
   4.10.2. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit’s CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing
   it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station.
   The following proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the
   unit’s CT program.
      4.10.2.1. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as
      contingency operations sorties.
 40                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


          4.10.2.1.1. Contingency operations sorties may count toward annual RAP
          requirements and may be used for look-back purposes.
          4.10.2.1.2. RAP events logged during contingency operations sorties may count
          toward annual RAP requirements and may be used to update currencies.
          4.10.2.1.3. Upon relief from contingency operations, units may prorate RAP sorties
          and events for the period of time each individual was tasked. Additionally, proration
          is authorized for deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where home
          station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM or by the availability of flight hours.
       4.10.2.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations varies
       considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provide valid training to be
       logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties may count toward RAP
       event requirements and these sorties/events cannot be prorated upon return to home
       station.
       4.10.2.3. Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
       the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment and then subtracting the number of
       valid RAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie
       proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion
       based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties.
   4.10.3. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended Squadron Officer’s School in residence from March through April for 56
   consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his
   training cycle due to the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying.

Table 4.3. Proration Allowance.
    Cumulative Days of          Months of Proration
Training Non-Availability           Allowed
          0 - 15                         0
         16 - 45                         1
         46 - 75                         2
         76 - 105                        3
        106 - 135                        4
        136 - 165                        5
        166 - 180                        6

4.11. Regaining CMR and BMC Status.
   4.11.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the End-of-Cycle flying
   requirements or end-of-cycle RAP event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 4.9
   4.11.2. If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet sortie look-back
   IAW paragraph 4.8, the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came
   off CMR or BMC status):
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                             41


      4.11.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The crewmember must complete a SQ/CC directed re-
      certification program IAW paragraph 4.8.1.3. In addition, the crewmember must regain
      RAP event currencies. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-
      certification to CMR.
      4.11.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.11.2.1 above, plus OGV-generated
      qualification and written examinations.
      4.11.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT. Sorties, individual events, ATDs
      and ground training as determined by the SQ/CC, plus qualification (and tactical if
      applicable) written exams, EPE and mission flight evaluation. The individual's training
      cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion of the flight evaluation.
      The instrument and/or qualification flight evaluations must be re-accomplished only if
      overdue.
4.12. Example of the Look-back, Regression, Proration and Requalification Process.
   4.12.1. Application scenario: Captain Smith is an experienced CMR crewmember with a 1-
   and 3-month look-back requirement of 4 and 10 RAP sorties respectively. On February 3,
   Captain Smith flew a counter-land sortie prior to departing for a non-flying TDY staff tour
   for 2 months. Captain Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April. What is Captain
   Smith's status throughout the TDY and on return to flying duty?
      4.12.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Captain Smith as a countable CMR crewmember for
      reporting purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 March, Captain Smith's Flight
      Commander (FLT/CC) performed the mandatory 1-month look-back (February). Captain
      Smith only flew one RAP sortie, failing the 1-month look-back. The FLT/CC then
      performed a 3-month look-back (Dec, Jan and Feb). This 3-month look-back showed
      that Captain Smith flew only 7 sorties for the period. Had Captain Smith flown two more
      sorties, the SQ/CC could continue him at CMR. However, with 7 sorties, Captain Smith
      did not meet the 3-month look-back for a CMR crewmember. The SQ/CC could regress
      Captain Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him
      as CMR.
      4.12.1.2. The SQ/CC carried Captain Smith on 1 month's probation. On 1 April, Captain
      Smith's 1-month look-back (March) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress
      Captain Smith to N-CMR. When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must
      place him in a re-certification program. Upon completing this program, Captain Smith
      must then re-establish a 1-month look-back by 1 May. Failing to re-establish a 1-month
      look-back by 1 May forces the unit to report Captain Smith N-CMR one more month
      until the next look-back process on 1 June.
      4.12.1.3. If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March and had last landed 48 days ago, he
      could fly a RAP sortie with an instructor to regain sortie currency. For CMR purposes,
      Captain Smith must fly 4 RAP sorties to recapture a 1-month look-back and achieve
      removal from probation.
      4.12.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 June, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months of
      Captain Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Captain Smith was
      deficient in one RAP sortie category. The SQ/CC could regress Captain Smith to N-
      CMR, if deemed significant. After he accomplished the tailored re-certification program
 42                                               AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


      (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC re-certified Captain Smith to CMR. This training
      counts for the new training cycle.

                                    UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines pilot and Sensor Operator/Cryptologic Operator upgrade
training programs for special capabilities and qualifications. Units will develop and maintain
local specialized training programs based on these guidelines. SQ/CCs may tailor programs for
individuals based on previous experience, qualifications and documented performance. These
capabilities and qualifications are in addition to core missions for the unit and may not apply to
every crewmember assigned or attached to the unit.
5.2. Requirements. Requirements for upgrade are listed in Table 5.1              Additionally,
commanders must ensure the candidate has adequate retain ability to justify the expenditure of
resources.

Notes.
1. Do not count ―other‖ time.
2. 100 hours since completion of AC Upgrade.
3. Commander recommendation.
4. Level C or better OFT time is creditable towards
PAA time.
5.3. Waiver Coordination. OG/CC has waiver authority over upgrade training requirements.
5.4. Aircraft Commander (AC) Upgrade. SQ/CCs have the authority to upgrade pilots to
Aircraft Commander status IAW this regulation. Simulator training is not required for AC
upgrade.
5.5. Instructor Upgrade.
   5.5.1. Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG) /Instructor Sensor Operator (SO) Upgrade
   (ISOU)/and Instructor Cryptologic Operator (ICO) prepares aircrew members for
   qualification as an instructor in their current crew position. The ACC MC-12W Instructor
   Upgrade Syllabus outlines instructors training program, academics course content, flying
   training requirements/tasks and certification procedures.
   5.5.2. Academic Training. Satisfactory completion of the following blocks of instruction
   prior to flight evaluation is required. Units will add considerations and techniques for
44                                                    AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


  specialized training to all applicable areas. At a minimum, ground training will consist of
  locally developed instruction in the following areas:
     5.5.2.1. Principles of Instruction. Learning objectives, instructor responsibilities,
     instructor-student relationship, training facilities, publications and MC-12W specific
     training considerations.
     5.5.2.2. Techniques of Flight Instruction. Training objectives and environment,
     recognition and analysis of common operator errors, maneuver demonstration, task
     performance and review and instructional limitations.
     5.5.2.3. Conduct of Flight Briefing. Use of briefing guides and audiovisual aids,
     briefing, debriefing and questioning techniques and use of recorded media for flight
     review.
     5.5.2.4. Ground Training. Subject knowledge evaluation and practical demonstration.
     Instructor candidates must demonstrate an advanced knowledge of aircraft systems and
     associated operational equipment to include: Aircraft systems, mission equipment,
     emergency procedures, degraded systems operations, expanded checklist procedures,
     pilot/Systems Operator procedures, controls and procedures, communication procedures,
     aircraft operations and limitations, NVG fundamentals and limitations, navigation, USAF
     and Joint TTPs and threats, tactics and countermeasures.
     5.5.2.5. Student Evaluations. Grading systems, squadron specific procedures and
     preparation and use of required forms.
     5.5.2.6. CRM instructor training will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew
     Resource Management Training Program prior to assuming duties as an instructor.
     Instructor CRM training may be accomplished prior to entering instructor upgrade
     training.
  5.5.3. Flying Training.
     5.5.3.1. The minimum recommended number of training requirements and total/type of
     sorties are listed in the instructor upgrade syllabus. Recommended training events are in
     Table 5.2
         5.5.3.1.1. Due to training limitations in theater, instructor upgrades may be
         accomplished via administrative upgrade based on SQ/CC or SQ/DO
         recommendation. The squadron CC or DO should exercise this option judiciously.
         IAW AFI11-202 Vol 2 para 5.2.1.4.1, the candidate must accomplish an instructor
         evaluation to be qualified as an instructor. The total hour’s requirement listed in
         Table 5.1 must be met. Additionally, the upgrading aircrew member must have
         completed a formal instructor upgrade course in another MDS.
     5.5.3.2. Specific training events do not have to be accomplished on specified sorties.
     However, all events must be accomplished within the construct of the upgrade program.
     Inability to complete specific training events need not delay certification. In such cases,
     SQ/CC will certify instructors with appropriate limitations to preclude performance of
     duties in which training is incomplete. Commanders may tailor the number of sorties and
     the type of training events to fit instructor candidate experience, duration of each training
     sortie and previous qualifications.        Unit programs should specify which tasks the
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                              45


     upgrade candidate will demonstrate, which tasks they will practice evaluating a student
     performance and which tasks they will do both.
     5.5.3.3. Basic Instruction Sortie.
        5.5.3.3.1. Instructing basic flight procedures will be performed.
        5.5.3.3.2. Specific Tasks: In-flight instruction, CRM and crew coordination, aircraft
        ground operations procedures, aircraft handling, patterns and landings, approaches
        (instrument and visual), single engine operations/landings, in-flight checks and
        checklist procedures, navigation procedures, mission briefing and debriefing,
        operational mission and emergency mission management, right seat procedures,
        weather and aircraft checks, tactical departures, tactical arrivals and NVG operations
        if applicable.     Note: NVG events may be accomplished on subsequent mission
        sorties if scheduling prevents night operations.
     5.5.3.4. RSTA Sortie.

   5.7.3. At a minimum, at least one FCF upgrade sortie will be flown. All ground propulsion
   systems checks and in-flight engine shutdowns and airstarts will be performed and evaluated.
   If unable to accomplish all FCF items on the checklist in flight, instructors may verbally
   debrief all other items.
5.8. Contingency and Exercise Pre-Deployment Training.
   5.8.1. This training will be conducted prior to deploying in support of contingency
   operations locations or combat exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure
   crewmembers' ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.
   5.8.2. Exercises. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to appropriate exercise
   plans (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercise points of contact to determine expected
   mission tasking (COMACC EXPLANs include EXPLAN 80 for Red and Maple Flags,
   EXPLAN 323 for Green Flag West and EXPLAN 163 for Green Flag East).
   5.8.3. Contingency Operations. For contingency operations, units are responsible for
   contacting appropriate gaining command or organizations to determine expected mission
   tasking. Prior coordination ensures unit preparation for the appropriate tasking and allows
   the responding OG/CC to tailor spin-up training for the theater, threat and tactics for the
   assigned task. The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementing spin-up training, prosecuting
   the required missions and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the
   desired level of proficiency. Units will place emphasis on training needed for missions not
   accomplished in daily operations. Conduct spin-up training IAW all applicable instructions.
   5.8.4. Attached and Supporting Crewmembers. Crewmembers not assigned to the supported
   squadron must receive spin-up training as determined by the supported SQ/CC. This
   requirement applies to all attached crewmembers (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.) and all
   crewmembers supporting from any other squadron (operational, test or FTU). The objective
   of this spin-up training is to ensure attached and supporting crewmembers are proficient to
   conduct all expected missions. The supported SQ/CC determines the amount of spin-up
   training required for each attached and supporting crew-member based on the individual's
   level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc. The supported and supporting
   squadron commanders will jointly agree on the administration, documentation and evaluation
   of required spin-up training.
   5.8.5. Ground Training. Crewmembers may be required to complete academic training prior
   to contingency operations or exercises. Units will brief contingency (or exercise) Special
   Instructions (SPINS), ROE and Command and Control (C2) procedures. Programs will
   emphasize deployment airfield capabilities, limitations, approach procedures and hazards. In
   addition, air defenses, area terrain and weather and unique operating procedures will be

   addressed. The local Weather Flight can assist with weather-unique training. Local
   intelligence organizations may assist the unit's intelligence functions in the development of
   threat assessments, training materials and expected collection tasking.
   5.8.6. Flying Training. Spin-up training will be tailored to ensure all supporting
   crewmembers are proficient, current and qualified in expected mission tasking.
   5.8.7. Responsibility. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating crewmembers
   are ready to deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.
5.9. Conversion/Difference Training.
   5.9.1. Conversion qualification is normally associated with training between MDSs.
   Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series aircraft in
   the same MDS. However, when the differences between series are great enough, the training
   is considered conversion training that requires completion of the formal school initial
   qualification course. Wing commanders will determine when conversion training is required
   within the same MDS. For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to
   handle the throughput, MAJCOMs will develop and coordinate with the training command
   in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
   5.9.2. Difference training (DT) for initial cadre is usually conducted under the supervision of
   engineering specialists (usually coordinated through program office officials) responsible for
   improving the MC-12W system (e.g. new engines, baseline upgrades, major software
   changes, etc.). These personnel usually will provide training for an initial cadre whenever
   possible. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of
   personnel for whom certain training requirements will be waived. Instructors completing DT
   will provide upgrade training to other unit crewmembers.
5.10. Initial Cadre. The following conditions apply to management of initial cadre
qualification.
   5.10.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew upgrades. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
   currently held unless previously qualified. The host unit providing training will document all
   DT and maintain the training folder until successful completion of the upgrade program.
   Initial cadre crewmembers are responsible for completing recommended training on any
   equipment, systems, or crew procedures which differ from that in the MDS they are currently
   qualified.
   5.10.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine which training events are applicable after
   examining the training and evaluation records of initial cadre and determine if a certification
   is applicable or whether a qualification evaluation (check ride) is required. OG/CC may
   require crewmembers to complete a written examination prior to unsupervised flight when
   emergency procedures have changed; even if an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification, flight evaluation is not required. A copy of proposed training qualification
   plan will be forwarded to MAJCOM OPR when training requires a flight evaluation.
5.11. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through
evaluations and documented on the AF FORM 8 or 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications are
attained through methods other than evaluation (e.g. instruction and instructor certified events or
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                 51


commander certifications) and may be documented on the AF FORM 1381, AF FORM 4348 or
appropriate training records/folder or in ARMS.
   5.11.1. The commander will select those aircrew members qualified in the unit’s mission to
   maintain additional special qualifications/certifications. Special qualification is gained with
   a flight evaluation (for special qualifications) or an instructor certification. Qualifications
   requiring evaluations will be documented IAW AFI 11-2-MC-12WV2. Special certification
   events are obtained by instructor supervised/administered training and proficiency training in
   the required tasks/event(s). Upon completion of the required task proficiency level the
   certifying instructor will be annotated in the crewmember’s training folder and on AF IMT
   1381. During MQT training, if syllabus resources allow and student is able to complete a
   special qualification or instructor-certified event within the normal syllabus without
   detracting from developing core skills, the special qualification may be annotated on the
   MQT Form 8. Instructors are authorized to teach any special qualifications in which they are
   qualified and current unless specifically restricted.

Terms
Air Reserve Component (ARC)—ANG and AFRC units and aircrew members, both associate
and unit-equipped.
Attrition Sortie—A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, non-RAP sortie, or
collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE, maintenance, etc.), fails to
accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper
accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule
and negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT, FTU IPUG/ISUG) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                  61


operational missions but does not maintain CMR status. Crewmember accomplishes training
required to remain familiarized in all and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary
missions of their weapon system and unit. BMC crewmember members may also maintain
special capabilities.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The member must
perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight standards
set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by pilots until completion of MQT. BAQ
is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the wing level and any other
pilots specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3/XO. Pilots are not authorized to perform RAP-
tasked combat event/sorties without instructor pilot or SQ supervisor supervision. Flight duties
will be limited to those identified in paragraph 4.1.1.
Critical Action Procedures—Emergency procedures identified as so important that failure to
accomplish would result in aircraft safety or mission failure.
Combat Air Patrol—A Combat Air Patrol is an aircraft patrol provided over an objective area,
over the force protected, over the critical area of a combat zone, or over an air defense area for
the purpose of providing air presence for air intercept, intelligence surveillance and
reconnaissance or strike, SCAR or other air missions for specified time periods.

(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions and
maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API-1/2’s, Squadron
Commander, Operations Officers and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions are required
to maintain this qualification level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to
train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC.
Composite Force Training (CFTR)—Scenarios employing multiple flights of the same or
different types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same
or different roles. (AFI 11-214)
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve pilot capabilities
to perform unit missions and pilot proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus missions,
tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC pilots.
 62                                                    AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


Conversion Training—Training required when units (or individual crewmembers) are
converting between MDS (i.e. C-12 to MC-12W). Conversion training is normally done through
formal training courses; however MAJCOMs may develop in-unit training when formal school
courses are not available. In-unit training plans should maximize the use of highly experienced
personnel as the initial cadre.
Currency—Minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general purpose
ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/ weapons Tech Orders must be
consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and -1 performance charts for recovery altitudes.
Difference Training—Training required when new systems/hardware come online which
represent significant changes from current configurations. Initial cadre instructors completing
difference training may provide training to other unit aircrew members at home station.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation—An evaluation of crewmember knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by a SEFE in an ATD, or the GCS. An
EPE may be administered orally if an appropriate training device is not available.
Experienced Crewmember (EXP)—For pilots: 200 hrs PAI, or previously EXPERIENCED
(as 11XX AFSC) and 100 hrs PAI. For SOs: 200 hrs PAI and six months CMR as an SO, or
previously EXPERIENCED (any MDS, any AFSC) and 100 hrs PAI.
Familiarization (FAM)—Normally requires a minimum of six weapons deliveries for PGMs
and bombing events in a twelve month cycle.

Initial Qualification Training—Training to qualify a crewmember in basic aircraft flying duties
without specific regard to the unit's operational mission. The minimum requirement for Basic
Aircraft Qualification status.
Instructor Upgrade Training—Training to qualify a crewmember to perform instructor duties.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or BMC
status.
NVG AirLand—NVG AirLand is the use of NVG equipped aircraft and crewmembers into and
out of airfields or assault zones (ALZ) for delivery of personnel, supplies and equipment to
support military objectives.
NVG Academic Refresher Training—IAW AFI 11-202V1, all NVG qualified crewmembers
will accomplish NVG refresher training IAW MAJCOM-developed courseware. When such
products are not available, units may develop an NVG refresher training program based on a
review of initial NVG academic courseware. The content and extent of this review should be
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                 63


tailored to the MC-12W mission environment. At the discretion of the unit commander, a
portion of this training may be completed with the Air Force Research Laboratory Night Vision
Goggle Refresher Course for Tanker and Transport Aircraft and may credit the NVG ground
training requirement. The Night Vision Goggle Refresher Course for Tanker and Transport
Aircraft provides an excellent refresher on NVG use, limitations, adjustment procedures, lighting
issues/compatibility, weather/environmental effects and hazards/shortfalls of NVGs. At least
some portion of the training must be completed through a guided lecture/discussion led by a
qualified NVG instructor. Aircrew members overdue for NVG refresher training are restricted
from NVG flight until this training is completed. Note: Units may obtain the above mentioned
training courseware by calling the Night Vision Program office at the Air Force Research
Laboratory (AFRLL/HEA), DSN 474-6561, extension 478.
Operational Flight Trainer (OFT)—A training device which dynamically simulates flight
characteristics. Used for normal, emergency and instrument procedures, to include safety of
flight, warfighting tasks and skill integration training (see AFH 36-2235V7)
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft assigned to meet the Primary Aerospace
Authorization 9PAA). The PAI forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the
PAI required to meet their assigned missions. (See AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle
Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and Termination.)
Primary Aerospace Vehicle Authorization (PAA)—- The number of aircraft authorized to a
unit for performance of its operational mission. The primary authorization forms the basis for the
allocation of operating resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying-hour
funds..
Proficiency—Demonstrated ability to successfully accomplish tasked event safely and
effectively. For purposes of this volume, proficiency also requires currency in the event, if
applicable.
Special Departure Procedures—An IMC procedure designed to allow increased takeoff gross
weight for multi-engine aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the
requirements stated in AFI11-202V3 paragraph 8.7.2. The runway and all obstacles along a
chosen takeoff path are analyzed and compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb
performance. The procedure provides a maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given
performance conditions that ensure vertical and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The
minimum allowable gross and net climb gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS, the
takeoff path is selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles
within the lateral limits of the chosen flight path are considered. The term SDP encompasses
both the use of the textual obstacle data information and the graphical departure procedures.
Specialized Training—Training in specialized tactics, weapons systems, or flight
responsibilities such as flight lead, instructor, LASDT, etc. This training may be conducted in
MQT or CT, as required.
Squadron Supervisor—Squadron Commander, Operations Officers (DO), Assistant Operations
Officers (ADO) and others designated in writing by the SQ/CC. Except for SQ/CC, DO and
ADO, appointment must be endorsed by OG/CC and qualification will be documented on unit
letter of X’s.

Training Cycle—The standard ACC RAP training cycle is aligned with a unit’s 20-month AEF
cycle. However, MC-12W units are considered Low-Supply/High-Demand (LSHD) and are not
aligned against a specific AEF pair. Therefore, the RAP training period is aligned with a 12-
month cycle, in order to best prepare for high operations tempo outside the normal AEF cycle.
Units will reference their MAJCOM RAP tasking message for specified training cycle and
reporting procedures. Units and individual crewmembers will complete all training requirements
within the appropriate training cycle unless specifically accepted by this instruction or HHQ
guidance.
Verification—Applies to procedure aimed at verifying and refreshing aircrew employment
knowledge, emphasizing conventional operations and mobile targets. Verification is conducted
in both initial and follow-on phases. Initial verification phase is a formal board proceeding
convened to verify individual aircrew knowledge. Continuation training is to reinforce, refresh
and update aircrews on unit wartime mission/tasking, tactics and procedures.
Visual Identification (VID)—(DoD, NATO) In a flight control system, a control mode in
which the aircraft follows a radar target and is automatically positioned to allow visual
identification.
Weapons Delivery—Simulated or actual expenditure of air-to-ground munitions representing a
typical combat configuration or SCL in a tactical scenario.

            GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Sortie and Mission Definitions.
   A2.1.1. Sortie. The operational nature of MC-12W requires clarification of the term sortie
   within the scope of this AFI. An MC-12W flight is defined as initial takeoff until the full
   stop landing. A sortie, for documenting events accomplished, is the portion of the flight in
   which an individual crewmember is performing his or her assigned duties. For the purposes
   of this instruction the terms mission and sortie are synonymous.
   A2.1.2. RAP Sortie (SR00)). RAP training sorties are oriented to developing basic combat
   skills or practicing tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission.
   If training is accomplished, a RAP sortie may be logged. Due to the nature of MC-12W L/R
   operations, pilot proficiency sorties (PPS) may be considered a RAP sortie. The PPS may
   also be included in sortie look-back.
   A2.1.3. Non-RAP Sortie (SX22). A sortie where combat skills training is not accomplished.
   Unless specifically tasked, there is no requirement to log non-RAP sorties.
   A2.1.4. Logging Sorties. Normally, crew members will not log more than one type of sortie
   on a single flight, unless:
       A2.1.4.1. Specifically allowed in the sortie description (i.e. instructor sortie).
       A2.1.4.2. A crewmember is relieved by another crewmember for the purpose of
       accomplishing a sortie and then subsequently takes over the position again during the
       same flight.
A2.2. Specific Sortie definitions.
   A2.2.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) (ME49) – Basic flying skills sortie.
   Training for proficiency in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope,
   consistent with operational and safety constraints.
   A2.2.2. Attrition Sortie (SC14) – A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie,
   Non-RAP sortie, or collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE,
   maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log
   these sorties properly. Improper accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie
   allocation, stresses to the unit schedule and negative impacts to the quality of unit training
   programs.
   A2.2.3. Collateral Sorties (SC00) – These sorties do not directly relate to combat
   employment or basic skills training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit
   operations. Functional check flights and air shows are in this category. These sorties are not
   required for RAP training purposes.
   A2.2.4. Commander Option Sortie (SR99) – A sortie that may be used to provide
   individualized training based on proficiency and demonstrated performance. This sortie may
   be allocated above the guidelines in the RAP tasking message for all mission types. The
   intent is to use these missions as necessary throughout the training cycle, rather than
   allocating them at the beginning of the training cycle.
66                                                   AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011


  A2.2.5. Contingency Operations Sortie (SC13) – Sorties at a contingency location, or in
  support of real-world operations, which provide limited or no RAP training and do not count
  toward training cycle RAP requirements. Units may use Contingency Operations sorties for
  look-back purposes. RAP events accomplished during sorties logged as Contingency
  Operations do not count toward training cycle RAP requirements; however individual events
  can be used to update currencies.
  A2.2.6. Demanding Sortie (SX13) – Sorties that task the aircrew to the extent that flying
  frequency and continuity are most critical. Authorized sorties/events requiring demanding
  mission currency are: CAS, SCAR, ASC, CSAR, CFTR, JFT, instructor duties, etc. SQ/CCs
  may add sorties/events to the demanding sortie list depending on unit tasking and the
  individual's capabilities. Also see Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.2.7. Instrument Sortie (SX15) – Basic skills sortie. Training designed to ensure
  instrument proficiency. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided
  accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Units are
  allocated sorties for every aircrew to accomplish their minimum basic skill, non-RAP,
  requirements.
  A2.2.8. Night Sortie (RC16) – Sortie on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50
  percent of flight duration or 1 hour, whichever is less, occur between the period of end of
  evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight. Night sorties may be dual-
  logged with RAP sorties.
  A2.2.9. Non-demanding Sortie (SX14) – A sortie that provides the aircrew with the
  opportunity to regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that
  have been under used during the non-flying period. Authorized sorties/events flown on a
  non-demanding sortie are: Instruments, AHC, RSTA, basic weapons delivery, etc. SQ/CCs
  may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and
  the individual's capabilities.
  A2.2.10. Pilot Proficiency Sortie (PPS, P070) – A basic proficiency sortie for practicing
  instrument, transition and emergency procedures. A minimum of one hour in the pattern
  should be scheduled for this event.
  A2.2.11. Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Sortie (SR81) –
  Sortie flown to develop proficiency in acquiring a tactical target (in any of the following
  categories) and satisfy applicable essential elements of information (EEI). Mission elements
  include:
     A2.2.11.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning.
     A2.2.11.2. Area search pattern (minimum 5 NM2).
     A2.2.11.3. Line of communications search pattern (minimum 10 NM).
     A2.2.11.4. Fixed (point) target acquisition (wide and narrow focus).
     A2.2.11.5. Mobile target tracking (minimum 3 minutes).
     A2.2.11.6. Actual or simulated interface to C2 element.
     A2.2.11.7. Actual or simulated Signal Intelligence (SI) mission.
AFI11-2MC-12WV1 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                   67


   A2.2.12. Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR) Sortie (SR77) – During a
   counterland mission/sortie act as primary killbox controller, reconnaissance, or attack

Description. ARMS event identifiers are standardized for crewmembers.
A3.1. Ground “G” Events.
   A3.1.1. Flight Physical. Will be accomplished IAW AFI 48-123 V4, Medical Examinations
   and Standards Volume 4— Special Standards and Requirements. Examination expires on the
   last day of the birth month annually. (For example, if an individual's birth month is March
   and a physical was accomplished 19 Jan 2002, the next physical is due not later than 31 Mar
   2003.)
   A3.1.2. Physiological Training. Will be accomplished IAW AFI 44-170 2.2.2, Preventive
   Health Assessment. PHAs become due (turn ―yellow‖) 12 months (366 days) from the last
   PHA completion date. Once the PHA becomes due, there is a 90-day ―yellow‖ window to
   accomplish the PHA before the PHA ―goes red‖ and the unit is penalized on their PHA IMR
   score. The PHA is green for 365 days; turns yellow (due) on day 366, and turns red (overdue)
   90 days later on day 456. An AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying, issued in
   conjunction with PHAs will be valid for the entire green and yellow periods (12 months plus
   90 days; 455 days total). It is not the intent of the 90-day yellow period to establish a de facto
   15-month PHA requirement. ―PHA due‖ notices will be forwarded by the UHM to unit
   Airmen during the first month of the 90-day window. The 90-day window allows more-than-
   adequate time to schedule/accomplish PHAs and other requirements for AF Form 1042s,
   accounting for leaves, TDYs, and other mission requirements. PHAs performed just prior to
   the 15-month cut-off should be the rare exception and not the rule.
