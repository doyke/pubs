1. Program Objective:
1.1. The SrA BTZ promotion program provides a one-time consideration for early promotion.
The program provides exceptionally well-qualified Airman First Class (A1C) to be considered
for promotion 6 months prior to the fully qualified point of promotion. Selection opportunity is
15 percent of the total time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) eligible population.
2. Roles and Responsibilities:
2.1. 11 WG/CC:
2.1.1. The 11 WG/CC is the convening authority for the SrA BTZ promotion program process.
The Commander formally approves/disapproves selection board recommendations and may elect
not to issue the full quota of promotions.
2.2. 11 WG/CCC:
2.2.1. The 11th Wing Command Chief provides program direction and guidance to include
coordination on all correspondence/information on the program. The 11 WG/CCC coordinates
with the Military Personnel Section (MPS) on scheduling BTZ board dates annually and selects
individuals to serve on the selection board no later than (NLT) 2 weeks prior to the board date.
2.3. MPS Chief (11 FSS/FSMP):
2.3.1. The MPS Chief has approval authority for supplemental consideration for those not
previously considered.
2.3.2. The MPS will coordinate with all other associated/assigned units on JBA to make up the
CBB (for small units/6 or less eligible) which will consist of a board President (11 WG/CCC or
designee), and four senior noncommissioned officers, and a MPS representative to be the board
recorder. Each board will have a representative from at least each of the following wings: 11
WG, 89 AW, and 79 MDW
2.4. Unit Commanders:
2.4.1. Unit commanders are required to recommend eligible members for consideration and also
after selection recommend for promotion before promotion effective date (Attachment 7).
2.4.2. Commanders are responsible for doing a quality check of all Airmen on the BTZ roster
for their respective unit. Commanders must make sure airmen are eligible for consideration and
have no negative quality indicators pending. Commanders must review all EPRs and the
member’s Personal Information File. Commanders should discuss nominations with the
member’s supervisors/rating chain prior to making a nomination decision. Individuals submitted
for nomination will be the very best performers, exemplify a positive role model for others, and
clearly deserve the recognition.
2.4.2.1. Commanders will ensure Airmen non-recommended to meet the board are notified
either verbally or in writing.
2.5. MPS:
2.5.1. Act as the overall OPR for JBA’s CBB and as the board recorder.

2.5.7. Prepare a nomination package/folder on each nominee for the CBB to include a BTZ RIP,
copies of all decoration citations, and AF IMT 1206 as prescribed in paragraph 6.3.
Accomplishments used on the AF IMT 1206 may come from any accomplishment from the time

members and board president prior to the CBB for their review and scoring/ranking.
2.5.10. Coordinate changes as necessary with the 11 WG/CCC and nominating units.
2.5.11. Prepare a report based on the findings of the CBB. The report will contain a list of board
members, board recorder, list of the nominees and order of merit (identifying total score and
select/non-select status), and cutoff score. This ensures alternates are identified in the event the
selectee(s) become ineligible for promotion. The report should be signed by the board president,
and coordinated through the respective WG/CC for approval.
2.5.12. Project BTZ promotions as soon as possible in the Military Personnel Data System
(MilPDS).

selectee is removed before the effective date. Commanders must remove the selectee versus
withholding the promotion.

MEMORANDUM FOR _____________________

FROM: 11 FSS/FSMPD

SUBJECT: Senior Airman (SrA) Below-the-Zone (BTZ) Unit Eligible List

1. The attached list identifies A1Cs assigned to your unit who may be considered for BTZ
promotion to SrA this quarter. They have a date of rank (DOR) within 6 months of the normal
fully qualified DOR for promotion to SrA. The instructions apply, as indicated:

___ a. Your unit has six or less eligible and may nominate one or more eligible A1Cs to
compete before the Centralized Base Board (CBB) to be held on __________________. Please
underline the name of your nominee(s) who will meet the board, sign the list and return the
original along with your nomination package to Career Development NLT
___________________.

___ b. Your unit has seven or more eligible and may select ____ A1Cs for SrA BTZ promotion
through your own unit selection procedures. Unit selection boards are to convene not earlier that
_____________ but not later than ________________. Please return the signed unit listing,
along with your unit’s board minutes to Career Development NLT ____________________ to
ensure timely update of personnel and pay data.

2. The SrA BTZ Unit Eligibility Listing is in three parts. Part I identifies promotion eligible
A1Cs. Part II lists “questionable promotion eligibles” (individuals with quality indicators) who
may not be qualified for BTZ promotion. Part III lists A1Cs who meet the TIG and TIS
requirements, but who cannot be selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in AFI
36-2502, Table 1.1.

3. Carefully review quality indicators (i.e., low EPR ratings, UIFs, etc.) before making your
selections. If the quality is not there, you are not required to use your full quota or even
nominate/select any or all of your eligibles. If no eligibles are selected, clearly state so, sign and
return the roster.

4. Airmen must have a 3-skill level to be promoted to SrA. Process PAFSC skill level waivers
for A1Cs with a 1-skill level according to AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1. On the BTZ roster, if the

airman has a 3-skill level, disregard the note “PAFSC skill level too low.” However, if the
airman does not have a 3-skill level, determine eligibility for a PAFSC skill level waiver and
process accordingly. Skill level requirements must be met by the effective date of promotion to
