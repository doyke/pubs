                                    PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE

1.1. Program Overview. The Air Force Library and Information System (AFLIS):
   1.1.1. Provides access to information essential to the Air Force mission.
   1.1.2. Supports professional military and voluntary education programs.
   1.1.3. Offers library facilities, resources, and services to enhance the quality of life for authorized
   customers.

1.2. Opening New Libraries. Installation commanders or commanders of specialized organizations
send requests to establish a library or information center to the Major Command Services Commander or
Division Chief (MAJCOM/SV). Libraries with an Air Force Library Account Number (FL) require a
full-time professional librarian to receive central appropriated funds, services, and support.
   1.2.1. MAJCOM/SV reviews and verifies the requirement, provides technical assistance, and coordi-
   nates the request with MAJCOM Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) monitor.
   MAJCOM DoDAAC monitors forward the request for an FL account number DoDAAC, a six posi-
   tion code that uniquely identifies a unit, activity, or organization that has the authority to requisition
   and/or receive material, to the Air Force DoDAAC monitor at HQ AFMC. Approved libraries receive
   a Supply Record Account Number (SRAN) and a DoDAAC. DoDAACs are issued IAW AFI 24-230,
   Maintaining the DoD Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) and DoD 4000.25-6-M, Part I, Depart-
   ment of Defense Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) (Activity Address Code Sequences). If the
   library is a contract operation, the base must appoint an accountable property officer other than a con-
   tract employee.
   1.2.2. Commander or division chiefs may not establish new libraries, branches, or information centers
   unless they demonstrate that existing library operations on the base cannot provide required services.
   Commanders of units that do not have a professional librarian authorized on the manning document
   and are not located on an Air Force base submit requests for library service through the MAJCOM to
   HQ AFSVA/SVPAL.

1.3. Closing and Consolidating Libraries. If organization commanders intend to close a library due to
a Base Realignment and Closure commission decision, or to consolidate FL account numbered activities,
they must send notifications a minimum of six months prior to the proposed action. The request must be
sent through MAJCOM/SVs and AFSVA/SVPAL.

1.4. Authorized Libraries. Libraries are authorized at each installation and, as Category A activities, are
mission sustaining programs IAW DoDI 1015.10, Programs for Military Morale, Welfare, and Recre-
ation (MWR). See Attachment 3 for library and information activities and services that make up the
multi-type AFLIS.

1.5. Customer Eligibility. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility. The installation
commander determines specific eligibility requirements.

    1.5.1. Non-Department of Defense (DoD) personnel enrolled in an Air Force or DoD sponsored edu-
    cation program may use library services when required by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
    and when showing proof of current enrollment.
    1.5.2. Air Force government contractor personnel are eligible to use Air Force libraries in accordance
    with contract requirements and AFI 34-262, Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2. Foreign military person-
    nel are eligible for library participation in accordance with support agreements.

1.6. Services Awards Program. See AFI 36-2852, Air Force Services Awards Program.

1.7. Assistance To Other Libraries. All Air Force Libraries are an integral part of the worldwide
library and information network. As such, they provide assistance to other non-Air Force libraries and
organizations for the purpose of furthering access to and use of the ever-expanding body of worldwide
scientific, literary and educational knowledge and information. This global partnership occurs through
cooperative activities such as interlibrary loan, resource sharing, and reference support.

        LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTER OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Program Standards. Operate libraries and information centers to meet published professional stan-
dards and guidelines (Attachment 4) and current industry practices. Only general libraries must meet the
standards defined in the DoD MWR Library Standards (DoDLS); AFI 36-2306, The Education Services
Program Education Assessment Program (EAP); and standardized AFLIS EAP checklist. The Golden
Eagle Standards for Air Force General Libraries are mandatory (see USAF/ILV message, R151211Z
Mar 99) and provide minimum standards for Air Force general libraries. The AF Library 5-Star Program
uses key Golden Eagle Standards to determine quality of service provided to customers.

2.2. Public Services. All libraries provide services based on customer needs identified in the Services
Market Survey data from marketing offices and other marketing methods, library program objectives, and
the AFLIS Strategic Plan as supplemented by the MAJCOM. Libraries conduct an annual review of cus-
tomer satisfaction and analyze results for needed changes in library operations, facilities, equipment, and
services. Libraries provide the following services:
   2.2.1. Two-way interlibrary loan (ILL) and resource sharing services. Adhere to the ILL Code for the
   United States. Libraries are authorized to charge ILL costs to a centrally funded account. Each library
   will have a written ILL policy and ensure that all ILL requests conform to the requirements of local
   lending protocol and the copyright law. Libraries maintain records of ILL requests and their fulfill-
   ment for three calendar years after the request is made IAW guidelines from the Commission on New
   Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.
   2.2.2. Document Delivery services. Utilize document delivery services for articles not available in the
   library collection. Libraries are authorized to use AFLIS centrally funded document delivery accounts
   when available. Librarians track document delivery costs by mission and organization, education or
   personal needs, and follow procedures on the AFLIS Resources web page.
   2.2.3. On-line access to commercial and government information and bibliographic databases.
   Librarians track information delivery costs by mission and organization, education, or personal needs
   to justify budget requirements.
   2.2.4. General libraries provide support services in the areas listed below. Academic and technical
   libraries support the parent organization’s mission.
       2.2.4.1. Mission support services. Include orientation classes for organizational representatives,
       briefings for commander’s calls, research, interlibrary loan, document delivery services, reference
       support, online database access, and publications.
       2.2.4.2. Education support services. Libraries provide academic support IAW DoDI 1322.25, Vol-
       untary Education Programs. Include research skill and orientation classes, reserve collections,
       reference librarians, and coordination of off-campus library support. Libraries shall operate a min-
       imum of 55 customer service hours per week. Thirty percent of operating hours will be night (after
       1700 hours) and weekend hours to accommodate student needs.
       2.2.4.3. Quality of life support services. Include all programs and services that enhance the qual-
       ity of life for military members and their families. Provide full library service to children and
       youth, including story hours and summer reading programs. Promote lifelong learning.

    2.2.5. Class A, defense switched network (DSN), defense data network (DDN), and commercial busi-
    ness telephone lines with routers and modems for data transmission, and time-share access to support
    on-line reference and resource sharing. Library staff computers should be connected to the base local
    area network (LAN) and added to the base Combat Information Transport System (CITS) plan for
    fiber optic connectivity to ensure reliable access to electronic, mission-essential information.
    2.2.6. Customer use equipment, including but not limited to: computers, printers, office software,
    typewriters, audio and video equipment, copiers, fax machines, electronic book readers, and scanners.
       2.2.6.1. Personal use of library computer resources by customers is authorized. See AFI 33-112,
       Computer Systems Management, paragraph 19. Libraries must follow guidelines IAW DoD

       tion via the Internet; AFI 33-204, Information Assurance (IA) Awareness Program; and AFSSI
       5027, Network Security Policy. Contact the local base network control center for applicable regu-
       lations that must be followed.

2.3. Facilities. General libraries and service centers must meet space criteria and design standards speci-
fied in DoD Military Handbook 1190, Facility Planning and Design Guide; AFI 32-1024, Standard
Facility Requirements; AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements; GES; and most current DoD and AF
Library Design Guides. Mission and organization for academic and technical libraries or information cen-
ters determine space criteria and design standards. Use current industry standards to develop
state-of-the-art facility requirements.
    2.3.1. Libraries follow guidance for temperature and humidity control as outlined in DoD Military
    Handbook 1190. Request waivers locally as required to meet specifications for operation of equip-
    ment and for preservation of materials.
    2.3.2. Library facilities will not be used to provide office, work, or storage space for functions not
    specifically related to library services, with the exception of a room that may be used for non-library
    meetings. All other uses are subject to installation commander approval and MAJCOM librarian
    review.
    2.3.3. Libraries are authorized appropriated fund custodial support and should be identified in the
    base contract for custodial support IAW DoDI 1015.10, Enclosure 6, MWR Program APF Support
    Table Authorization, and AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support to Morale, Welfare, and Recre-
    ation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.

2.4. Library Collections. Library Directors determine the size and scope of their collections by assess-
ing the quality and currency of materials, customer needs, funding, staffing, and physical space. Librari-
ans follow these general guidelines:
    2.4.1. General library collections must include materials to support organizational mission require-
    ments, professional military and voluntary education programs, lifelong learning, and quality of life
    for adults and children. Libraries are authorized lease or rental plans for materials to meet demand for
    new missions, special initiatives, newly published items, and to enhance quality of life programs.
AFI34-270 23 JUNE 2005                                                                                      9


   2.4.2. Select library materials using subject specialist input, professional journals, bibliographic tools,
   and collection analysis. Also use ILL indicators, weeding factors, customer requests, and market sur-
   veys for collection development.
   2.4.3. Provide information in print, non-print, and electronic formats.
   2.4.4. Emphasize access to information and materials rather than the size of the collection. Use
   on-line databases, DVD/CD-ROM full-text products, interlibrary loans, and document delivery ser-
   vices when these resources prove cost-effective and practical.
   2.4.5. Follow the American Library Association (ALA) Bill of Rights to ensure that the selection pro-
   cess is free from censorship. Libraries will also apply the principles of intellectual freedom, not only
   in selection, but also in all aspects of library service, by implementing the Interpretations of the
   Library Bill of Rights, the Privacy Act, and the procedures for handling complaints set forth in the
   Intellectual Freedom Manual and updates from the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom. Adherence
   to federal regulations must take precedence.
   2.4.6. Establish a written collection management policy to ensure that collections meet customer
   needs; evaluate collections regularly to eliminate old, obsolete, and worn materials; and establish and
   implement an inventory plan using professional methods. Establish and update the collection develop-
   ment plan annually and include subject areas weeded, collection strengths and weaknesses, and col-
   lection goals. Forward the plan and annual updates to the MAJCOM librarian for approval.
   2.4.7. Special, scientific or technical library, and technical information center collections must pro-
   vide current, in-depth materials in direct support of the parent organization's mission.
   2.4.8. Determine academic library collections by curricula and accreditation standards.
   2.4.9. Provide audio and video collections focusing on business, education, personal improvement,
   and children and youth interests. Libraries may not charge viewing fees. Follow the AFLIS Procure-
   ment Guide procedures located on the AFLIS Resources web page.

2.5. Training. All librarians should attend professional training courses, workshops, or conferences on
an annual basis.
   2.5.1. Directors of general libraries develop training plans to ensure that all personnel are technically
   competent in their jobs. In general libraries, ensure that all staff know how to help customers complete
   circulation transactions, locate materials, operate public access equipment and use various library
   technologies.

2.6. Technical Services. Libraries use modern technology and centrally contracted services to acquire,
catalog, and process materials.
   2.6.1. Libraries use centrally funded cataloging service contracts or On-line Computer Library Center
   (OCLC) services for catalog cards or electronic records and enter holdings in the OCLC On-line
   Library Union Catalog (OLUC). Other cataloging services may be used upon approval from HQ
   AFSVA/SVPAL.
   2.6.2. General libraries use the Dewey Decimal System of Classification for materials and Library of
   Congress (LC) subject headings. Automated cataloging systems must use the standard full
   machine-readable cataloging (MARC) record format.
10                                                                             AFI34-270 23 JUNE 2005


     2.6.3. Technical and academic libraries normally use the LC classification system for books. Techni-
     cal reports from most agencies are cataloged in the Committee on Scientific and Technical Informa-
     tion (COSATI) format, following COSATI cataloging rules.
        2.6.3.1. Small technical libraries may use the Dewey Decimal Classification system.
     2.6.4. Purchase preprocessed books and use copy cataloging and centrally funded contracts to save
     staff time and reduce costs. Establish cataloging and book-processing profiles with appropriate ven-
     dors.

2.7. Supplies and Equipment. Librarians acquire specialized library supplies and standard library furni-
ture and equipment. Provide equipment specified in paragraph 2.2.6. See Chapter 3 for allowable fees
and charges. See the AS listing in Attachment 5 for library equipment authorizations.

2.8. Official Mail. Libraries may use official and priority mail for all library transactions, including
interlibrary loans, as specified by DoD 4525.8-M, DoD Official Mail Manual, and AFI 65-106.

2.9. Marketing and Public Relations. Library directors conduct aggressive marketing and public rela-
tions programs to promote library services and use, as well as to obtain funding, staffing, facility improve-
ment, grounds maintenance, responsive procurement action, and community involvement. Directors of
general libraries use Services Market Survey data to identify market trends and to develop a marketing
plan. General libraries are authorized marketing support IAW AFI 34-104, Services Marketing and Pub-
licity Program.

2.10. Accountability Records. Libraries maintain property custodian records, requisition and purchase
orders, salvage and inventory control documents, written follow-ups, and memos in official files in accor-
dance with AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-139,
Records Disposition Schedule, Table 34-3.
     2.10.1. Accountable Property Agent. The organization commander appoints a professional librarian
     as the accountable property agent for all library materials and services in a memorandum. For contract
     libraries, the base must appoint an accountable officer other than a contract employee. The Services
     commander or division chief, or the commander of a specialized organization with a library or infor-
     mation center, appoints an interim accountable property agent during periods when there isn't an
     assigned librarian. Keep original documents with the AF Form 194, Library Balance Record. Send
     one copy of each memorandum to the MAJCOM librarian whenever a new librarian or interim
     accountable property agent is appointed.
        2.10.1.1. Libraries operating under a NAFI MOA and contract libraries are responsible for
        accountability of library materials and equipment in accordance with the terms of the NAFI Mem-
        orandum of Agreement, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Statement of Work (SOW), or
        other document describing NAFI responsibilities and work to be accomplished.
     2.10.2. Library Balance Records. Libraries without an automated Integrated Library System (ILS)
     use AF Form 194 to document collection acquisitions and withdrawals. Use a separate form for each
     type of material. Libraries with an ILS generate reports at the end of each fiscal year (FY) or when
     needed which provide a chronological record of each type of material added to or removed from the
     collection.
AFI34-270 23 JUNE 2005                                                                                  11


  2.10.3. Shelf List Records. Librarians keep an official shelf record for every item in the permanent
  collection in either card or automated format. The permanent collection consists of items purchased
  with central or local library funds as well as donated items that have been officially added to the
  library balance record.
  2.10.4. Loaning Library Materials. Follow these guidelines:

     materials. Comply with AFI 33-332, Force Privacy Act Program, when registering customers.
  2.10.5. Overdues. Library directors establish an aggressive notification system for enforcing the
  timely return of borrowed materials. Follow these guidelines:
     2.10.5.1. Send the first overdue notice to personnel not later than 10 calendar days after the due
     date, the second notice 20 calendar days after the due date, and the third notice 30 calendar days
     after the due date.
     2.10.5.2. Libraries may not charge fines for overdues.
     2.10.5.3. The Services commander or the commander of a specialized organization recommends
     local disciplinary measures to ensure that personnel return library materials within the prescribed
     time limits.
  2.10.6. Replacing or Paying for Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed Library Material. Borrowers must

     the standard payment procedures outlined in DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, General Accounting and
     Finance Systems at Base Level.
  2.10.7. Property Marking of Library Materials. All library materials are USAF property, regardless of
  the fund or procurement source. Library staff members must affix property markings on all acquired
  materials, including those that are purchased for office use. Remove all property markings when with-
  drawing materials from the library collection.
  2.10.8. Library Inventory. Follow these guidelines:
     2.10.8.1. Each newly assigned library director must conduct a physical count of all library mate-
     rials to verify balances before transferring accountability from the previous librarian. Automated
     shelf-list records may be used to verify total holdings.
12                                                                              AFI34-270 23 JUNE 2005


        2.10.8.2. General libraries will conduct a shelf-list inventory of all library materials at least once
        every 5 years. Report inventory results and any discrepancies on the narrative section which
        accompanies the Library Annual Report Program (LARP).
        2.10.8.3. Drop items missing for one complete year and adjust library balance records using an
        inventory adjustment memo. Remove item records from the ILS, card catalog, and OCLC or other
        similar union catalogs as required. Maintain statistics of withdrawn items for the LARP.
     2.10.9. Disposal of Library Materials. Follow these guidelines:
        2.10.9.1. Librarians in general libraries coordinate with the Services Logistics staff for turn-in of
        obsolete or irreparably worn library materials to the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office
        (DRMO). Librarians must contact DRMO for current turn-in procedures.
        2.10.9.2. Library directors coordinate with the command librarian to redistribute excess materials
        as well as library-specific supply items that are in usable condition. Send excess materials to Air

                                           LIBRARY FUNDING

3.1. Designated Funding Category. The Air Force designates general libraries as MWR Category A,
mission-sustaining activities and funds them primarily with APFs. The Air Force funds academic and
technical libraries totally with APFs.
     3.1.1. Libraries are not revenue generating activities and may not charge customers for materials and
     services except as stated in paragraph 3.5.
     3.1.2. Library personnel may not hold fund-gathering activities or sales in Air Force libraries since
     libraries are designated category A activities.
     3.1.3. Libraries are authorized APF and NAF support for special programs that support the library
     mission, quality of life, and promote literacy. Support from Services Marketing offices is authorized.
     3.1.4. Libraries track mission-support costs for materials and services that may be reimbursable under
     DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support. These services include purchases,
     on-line uses, interlibrary loans, and document deliveries. Libraries also use this information to justify
     annual budgets.

3.2. Local Appropriated Funds. Refer to AFI 65-106 for authorized local APF expenditures for support
of general libraries. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, for guidance on
unauthorized centrally funded expenditures.
     3.2.1. General libraries must fund leisure and recreational programs for adults and children with local
     APFs. Central APFs are not authorized for these purposes.
     3.2.2. Library directors prepare, justify, and submit an annual budget to local resource advisor or bud-
     get office by following local directives. Send a copy of the local budget to the command librarian after
     approved at local level.
     3.2.3. All libraries must have an APF copier, data fax machine, commercial and DSN telephone lines,
     and Internet capability to meet mission-support requirements and interlibrary loan services. Library
     staffs are authorized “.mil” Internet access; commercial Internet Service Providers (ISP) are used for
     customer Internet access.

3.3. Central Appropriated Funds. All libraries and information centers are authorized the use of cen-
tral APFs except Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) libraries funded with 3600
funds. HQ AFSVA/SVPAL allocates central APFs to libraries through their MAJCOMs to purchase
materials and services in direct support of Air Force mission requirements, library missions, and profes-
sional and voluntary education programs. See paragraph 4.8. and the instructions in LEOS for types of
materials and services that libraries may fund with central APFs.
     3.3.1. Each library that uses authorized central funds submits an annual budget with justification and
     required documentation in the format requested to the MAJCOM by the suspense date in the call let-

3.4. Nonappropriated Funds (NAF). Libraries may not use NAFs except as specified in AFI 34-201,
Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). Record NAF expenses to the cost center incurring the expense.
Certain NAF costs recorded to general ledger account codes (GLAC) are excluded from Category A APF
computation. Refer to AFI 34-201, Attachment 5, for computation instructions.

3.5. Library Equipment. Since libraries are Category A activities, equipment must be purchased and
maintained with APFs. However, library revenue generating equipment for customer use such as copiers,
data fax machines, and supplies for such equipment, must be procured or leased with NAFs. Charges off-
set the cost of equipment and supplies purchased or leased with NAFs.
   3.5.1. Library NAF Equipment. Use NAF funds generated from user fees for maintenance and sup-
   plies to operate equipment. Libraries budget for revenue generating equipment in the NAF Require-
   ments Budget and for the supplies and maintenance in the Income and Expense Budget. Income
   generated by the machines is justification for purchasing replacement equipment. See AFMAN
   34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management and Accounting.
   3.5.2. Library APF Equipment. Libraries use APFs to purchase new equipment IAW AFI 34-201,

4.6. Central Procurement Guidance. Library and information centers authorized to purchase materials
and services with central funds must use LEOS and follow the procedures in the AFLIS Central Procure-
ment Guide and other guidance found on the AFLIS Resources web page.

4.7. Contracting Agencies. Air Force libraries expend central APFs through these agencies:
   4.7.1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC/PKWRM) at Wright-Patterson AFB awards contracts
   for AFLIS consolidated orders and sole source purchases. ASC/PKWO issues the Government Pur-
   chase Card (GPC) to HQ AFSVA/SVPAL to buy library materials and services.
       4.7.1.1. HQ AFSVA/SVPAL maintains and verifies funding documents such as the AF Form 616,
       Fund Cite Authorization; AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Fund Cite Authoriza-
       tion; AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document; and DD Form 448,
       Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request. All funding documents are routed electronically
       to ASC/FM for funds certification.
       4.7.1.2. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) pays all contractor bills.
       HQ AFSVA/SVPAL processes all invoices and billing documents, tracks vouchers, and confirms
       payments via DFAS electronic databases.

Volume 2, Pt 2). See also paragraph 3.3.
   4.8.1. If central APFs are not available for office requirements, offices may use unit funds to purchase
   mission essential commercial publications. Regardless of funding source, purchases with AF Form 9,
   Request for Purchase, must be coordinated with the local base library. The base library is the sole
   focal point for tracking mission essential publications for offices. This data is required for RCS:
   HAF-SVA (A) 7140 (LARP).
   4.8.2. Subscriptions may be renewed against the appropriation current at the time the subscription is
   ordered. The subscription may extend beyond the end of the current FY, be for more than one FY, or
   begin in a subsequent FY. (Refer to Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations, formerly
   DFAS-DE 7000.4-R and AFR 170-8).

                            LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES

A3.1. General Libraries meet the complex, multifaceted information needs of the military community as
well as provide quality-of-life support. These needs include supporting mission, education, technical, and
personal information requirements and encouraging personnel to use leisure time productively.

A3.2. Academic Libraries are an integral part of the instructional and professional development programs
of either an Air Force formal school or a college-level educational institution.

A3.3. Scientific or Technical Libraries and Information Centers provide information to personnel who
work in RDT&E programs or support other technical functions.
     A3.3.1. Information centers operate in close cooperation with the scientific and technical information
     officer (STINFO). Professional librarians or information specialists may be designated as the
     STINFO.

A3.4. Library Service Centers provide technical support, library materials and services to remote sites,
deployed units and libraries.

A3.5. Command Reference Library and Information Centers provide a central reference and interlibrary
loan service function to command libraries. The command librarian may designate any type of library or
information activity as a reference library.

A3.6. Contractor-Operated, Most Efficient Organization (MEO), and NAFI MOA libraries are identified
to HQ AFSVA/SVPAL by the command librarian. Contract, MEO, and NAFI MOA operations are part of
the AFLIS program and must function within AFLIS program parameters.
     A3.6.1. Use the Air Force standard PWS, SOW, Strategic Sourcing NAFI MOA Guidance, or other
     document for the description of services when outsourcing general library services. Requirements of
     the Air Force standard PWS, SOW, NAFI MOA, or description of services may not be deleted with-
     out written permission from HQ AFSVA/SVPAL or the MAJCOM Librarian. The standardized Air
     Force templates may be modified with approval of the MAJCOM librarian to meet local requirements.
     A3.6.2. Send one copy of the description of services and the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
     (QASP) for each library contract and/or NAFI MOA to the command librarian for review and
     approval.
     A3.6.3. Professional librarians or information specialists with a Masters Degree from an ALA accred-
     ited program and a minimum of three years postgraduate professional experience operate contract,
     MEO, and NAFI MOA libraries. The contract, MEO, and NAFI MOA librarians must:
        A3.6.3.1. Follow this AFI; the PWS, SOW, MOA and/or description of services; QASP; and all
        other applicable instructions and directives.
     A3.6.4. Professional library staff in contract, MEO and MOA libraries will have applicable degrees
     and qualifications. Reference librarians will have at least one year of professional experience in refer-
     ence work, including on-line and DVD/CD-ROM search and retrieval and bibliographic instruction.

   Computer System Administrators will have a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer or Information Sciences
   or applicable library computer systems and local/wide area network experience. Full-time positions
   are necessary for key personnel.
   A3.6.5. Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) should have a Master’s Degree in Library or Informa-
   tion Science from an ALA accredited library school to ensure competent oversight and management
   for quality customer services. The QAE must have technical knowledge and experience in the area to
   be contracted that is sufficient to permit them to observe contractor performance and to determine
   whether the service does or does not meet the contract standards.
   A3.6.6. Contractor will furnish an initial list of key personnel and library staff with a resume for each
   to the QAE prior to the start of any contract and update it as staff changes occur.

A3.7. Office Reference Collections are established by the library director when an organization must
have reference materials on hand to meet essential mission informational requirements. Quasi-libraries, or
small libraries formed by an activity to house oversized office collections and managed by a library tech-
nician or clerk without librarian supervision, should not be created. Exceptions are communications/com-
puter documentation libraries and technical report/equipment manual collections.

A3.8. Library Extension Services are authorized by MAJCOMs to provide specialized assistance for per-
sonnel who don't have access to established library and information services. Extension services include
the following types of libraries:
   A3.8.1. Branch Libraries offer a full range of materials and services. They have set operating hours,
   separate quarters, a paid staff, and a basic collection of materials. A main library or library service
   center directs branch operations.
   A3.8.2. Field Libraries house a collection of general reading materials issued from a library or library
   service center to an Air Force, DoD, or State Department activity for which Air Force has support
   responsibility (see DODI 1015.10, Enclosure 11). Field libraries may or may not have set operating
   hours or paid staff. They may operate on the honor system.
   A3.8.3. Site Libraries house a collection of print and non-print materials issued to a remote location
   at the request of the local installation or Services commander to enhance library services. It may or
   may not have paid staff and set operating hours. It is under the administration of the local site com-
   mander and is serviced from a library or library service center.
