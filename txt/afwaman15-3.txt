This manual is applicable to all terrestrial and space weather products. It specifies the file
naming convention to be used for all shared products created on systems operated by Air Force
Weather Agency (AFWA) units. Legacy systems may waive compliance with this manual, but
this manual shall guide the acquisition of new production systems to further interoperability,
reduce maintenance costs, and support improved backup capabilities. New systems may waive
compliance if the developer/Program Office has compelling evidence that compliance with the
convention will adversely impact development costs or system effectiveness.

In general, product files created by processing centers outside of AFWA will not be renamed
upon ingest into the Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS). Exceptions may be made,
however, in order to maintain key information about product files. A good example of this
involves the extensive use of directory structures by the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) to identify their product files. As the files are separated from their native
directory tree for insertion into AFWWS storage, critical file information may be lost. In order
to maintain all necessary information to unambiguously identify the content of the files, some
NCEP files will be renamed by appending the original filename to filename elements contained
in the NCEP directory tree. Renaming of files created by external organizations will be handled
on a case-by-case basis in accordance with AFWA processes.

1. General.
     1.1. Purpose. This document outlines the filename convention to be used in naming
     weather product files produced by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
     1.2. Background. In order to fully optimize the benefits of product filename
     standardization, the standard employed by two other national processing centers (Fleet
     Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and the National Centers for
     Environmental Prediction (NCEP)) was used as the basis for the AFWA convention. The
     NCEP standard can be viewed at: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/datamgmt/filstnd.html.
     Adoption of a single filename convention across AFWA is expected to result in benefits
     including improved center-to-center interoperability, faster troubleshooting of data transfer
     issues, improved cross-center backup capabilities, easier product identification by customers,
     more coordinated growth of systems, reduced translation processing, improved automation
     capabilities, and reduced system maintenance cost.
        1.2.1. While based upon the standard developed by NCEP and FNMOC, the AFWA
        standard makes some departures from its predecessor. General departures are explained
        in the following paragraphs, while element-specific departures are detailed later in this
        document.
AFWAMAN15-3 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                       3


           1.2.1.1. Filename lengths will not exceed 128 characters. While this limitation is not
           identified in NCEP’s documentation, it is not exceeded at NCEP or FNMOC.
           1.2.1.2. Filenames generated within AFWA systems will not use lowercase
           characters (a-z) to avoid overwriting files on operating systems that are not case-
           sensitive, such as Microsoft Windows. This is more restrictive than the NCEP
           standard, which allows uppercase and lowercase characters.
Note: Some applications and utilities may add filename extensions that are lower case by
default. Care must be taken to override this behavior by specifying an output filename extension.
           1.2.1.3. With few exceptions, filename elements are not required to be of fixed
           length. The use of special characters as delimiters trivializes fixed position elements.
           Note: NCEP’s document lists fixed length as a requirement, but NCEP has
           operationally abandoned this restriction.
           1.2.1.4. Reliance on directory name for product information shall be avoided
           whenever possible. Inclusion of all necessary information in the filename greatly
           reduces the chance of losing critical information once a product file is separated from
           its native directory. This restriction is not intended to prevent development of a
           structured directory system, but only to ensure all key product information is also
           included in the stand-alone filename.
           1.2.1.5. The use of the hyphen character has been expanded. The NCEP standard
           restricted its use to only temporal or spatial intervals, but AFWA needs a way to
           identify parameters needing multiple descriptors. As such, the use of hyphens has
           been expanded to be a general separator between multi-part element descriptors.
           1.2.1.6. The plus sign character (‘+’) has been added to separate multiple parameters
           or multiple areas contained within a single product. The NCEP standard does not use
           the plus sign. For the AFWA predominant operating systems (Windows and Unix),
           this character is allowable in filenames.
   1.3. Phased Implementation Approach. Transition of legacy systems to a new filename
   convention is not expected to be a trivial effort. Some older systems may be too close to the
   end of their lifecycle to merit the expense of transition. Program management will determine
   which systems will migrate to the new standard and the timing of the transitions.
   1.4. Change Procedures. As this convention is to be applied across the AFWA enterprise,
   changes to it must be carefully managed to minimize negative impacts to systems using the
   convention. Careful consideration must be given to coordination and scheduling of changes.
       1.4.1. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The Data Administrator (DAd) at HQ
       AFWA shall be the OPR for updating the filename convention. Change requests shall be
       submitted     to    the   organizational    email   account    for    the    office:
       AFWAA6WN@offutt.af.mil.
       1.4.2. Coordination Process. While the DAd is the OPR for changes to the publication,
       AF/A3O-WP shall have oversight to ensure broad coordination of changes. Interim
       changes shall be posted on the shared documents portion of the AFWA/A6W SharePoint
       site to allow implementation prior to the next release of the formal filename convention
       document. Contact DAd for a link to the SharePoint site. For those who do not have

        access to the SharePoint site, advanced draft updates can be requested from the DAd
        using the organizational email account listed in paragraph 1.4.1.
2. The Convention.
     2.1. Filename Elements. Filenames are constructed from individual elements of
     information. Each element is identified by a two-character element identifier (ID), which is
     followed by a single period and a variable length descriptor. For example, PS.AFWA
     indicates the product source is AFWA. The filename elements that will be employed by
     AFWA are generally a subset of those listed in the NCEP standard, with a couple of
     additions. Table 2.1 lists alphabetically the complete set of elements that will be employed
     by AFWA. A more detailed description of the use of each of the elements can be found in
     Attachment 2.

Table 2.1. Filename Element Descriptions.
Element ID      Description
AR              Area of Data – identifies the geographic coverage of the product
CY              Cycle of Run – identifies the cycle time upon which the product is based
DC              Data Category – identifies the broad category representative of the product
DD              Data Date – identifies the single date for which the product is valid
DF              Data Format – identifies the format of the data (often related to MIME type file
                extension)
DI              Distribution – identifies the distribution statement for the product
DP              Data Date Period – identifies the range of dates for which the product is valid or
                the period of record for climatological products
DS              Data Subcategory – identifies the specific category representative of the product
DT              Data Time – identifies the single time for which the product is valid

PA              Parameter – identifies the atmospheric parameter or product description detailed
                in the product
PD              Publication Date – identifies the date a publication was released
PN              Publication Number – identifies the library number of a publication
PS              Product Source – identifies the organization that generated the product
SC              Security Classification – identifies the classification level of the product
SN              Sequence Number – identifies a particular product placement in a series of
                related products (primarily for animations)
SP              Special Processing – identifies special processing applied to a product to
                differentiate it from the standard product
TP              Data Time Period – identifies the range of times for which the product is valid
AFWAMAN15-3 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                           5


     2.2. Special Characters. The use of special character is consistent with NCEP
     documentation, except as noted in paragraph 1.2.1.5. Only four special characters are
     allowable, and each has a unique purpose within the filenames. Table 2.2 identifies the
     allowable special characters and the acceptable use of each. Allowable “non-special”
     characters include the uppercase alphabet characters (A-Z) and the numerals (0-9).

Table 2.2. Special Character Usage.
Character Name        Character ASCII Value         Use
Period                .         46                  Separates element ID from its descriptor
                                                    Example: PS.AFWA…
Underscore            _            95               Separates individual filename elements
                                                    Example: PS.AFWA_SC.U...
Hyphen                -            45               Separates multi-part descriptors within a
                                                    single filename element
                                                    Example: …PA.MAX-SFC-TEMP…
Plus Sign             +            43               Separates multiple descriptors within a single
                                                    filename element
                                                    Example: …PA.WND+DVAL…
     2.3. Sequence of Elements. The NCEP/FNMOC standard does not mandate any particular
     sequencing of filename elements, but rather allows each processing center to determine the
     order of the elements. The AFWA standard further restricts the ordering of elements, but
     still allows some flexibility to account for differing needs across the continuum of products.
     Table 2.3 identifies the sequence of elements by group. While not all elements are needed to
     describe all files, those used will be ordered relative to the other elements in the same order
     as listed in the table. In general, only those elements needed to uniquely and unambiguously
     identify the contents of the file are required to be used, but four elements are mandatory: PS,
     SC, DI, and DF.

Table 2.3. Sequence of Elements.
Group Element ID(s)           Notes
1     PS                      Product Source will always be the first element in the filename.
2     SC                      Security Classification will always be the second element in the
                              filename.
3         DI                  Distribution will always be the third element in the filename.
                              Selection of correct distribution statement shall be coordinated with
                              the Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO) Officer.

               FORMAT AND DESCRIPTORS OF FILENAME ELEMENTS

Notes on syntax employed in describing formats:
       - Each element starts with its two-character element ID. The element IDs are typed
       exactly as they should appear in a filename.
       - Character-based descriptors are normally represented as a series of X’s, but in some
       cases other characters are used to distinguish special descriptor parts.
       - Numeric-based descriptors are represented as a series of D’s, except for date and time.
       - Dates are represented by YYYY for year, MM for month, and DD for day.
       - Times are represented by HH for hour and MM for minute.
       - A bracketed ellipsis ( “[…]” ) is used to indicate additional characters or digits may be
       used to fully describe the element of information. Indicates a variable-length field.

Section A2.1. – Area of Data.
A2.1. Area of Data. This describes the geographic coverage of the product. Descriptors below
can be combined with compass headings (e.g., N, E, S, W, NE, NW) to more clearly delineate
product coverage. For example, SW-ASIA would indicate Southwest Asia.
     A2.1.1. Format. AR.X[…], where X[…] is one or a combination of the descriptors in
     Table A2.1 or for a point product, the approved International Civil Aviation Organization
     (ICAO) identifier, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) identifier, or Union Radio
     Scientifique Internationale (URSI) identifier for the location for which the product is valid.
     Multiple descriptors may be used to fully describe the area of coverage. In the case of
     multiple areas of coverage, the individual area will be separated by the plus sign character
     (‘+’). An example of this would be, “AR.EUR+N-AFRICA.” For point products, if a
     location does not have an officially sanctioned identifier, the location name may be
     substituted. User specified area descriptors will be encouraged to identify the area of custom
     mission support products (e.g., 11-OWS, GCCS-402). This will support the consistent
     identification of a customized area for numerous related products and reduce the proliferation
     of multiple areas defined by the same more general descriptor (e.g. SW-ASIA). User
     specified area descriptors must be negotiated between the product producer and user to
     ensure clear understanding of area boundaries. The alphanumeric portion of the
     Consolidated Dissemination Capability (CDC) at AFWA has binned text-based bulletins into
     pre-defined 20 x 20 degree latitude/longitude boxes. The area descriptions for those boxes,
     as well as map graphically depicting their layout are included as Attachment 4 to this
     manual. The Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS) uses a satellite
     identifier in the AR element to indicate geographic coverage of certain data types as
     shorthand to indicate the sensor field of view during the measurement.

Section A2.9. – Data Time.
A2.9. Data Time. This identifies the single time for which the product is valid. (See also A2.2
Cycle of Run and A2.22 Data Time Period.)
     A2.9.1. Format. DT.HHMM[SS], where HH is the two-digit hour in the range 00 to 23
     and MM is the two-digit minute in the range 00 to 59 and SS is the two-digit second in the
     range 00-59. Hour, minute, and second numbers requiring fewer digits will be zero filled.
Section A2.10. – Forecast Hour.
A2.10. Forecast Hour. This identifies the offset in hours from the cycle time to the valid time
of a forecast.
     A2.10.1. Format. FH.HHH[MM], where HHH is the number of hours between the base
     (cycle) time and the forecast valid time, and MM is the number of minutes. The minutes can
     be included to allow differentiation of forecast periods between whole hour boundaries.
     Note: HHH and MM are fixed length fields. Hours requiring less than three digits will be
     zero padded to three digits. Likewise, minutes requiring less than two digits will be zero
     padded. For example, a six hour forecast would be labeled as “FH.006”.
Note: This departs from the NCEP usage of forecast hour. NCEP instead lists the valid time of
the product in the forecast hour.

Section A2.11. – Grid.
A2.11. Grid. This identifies the projection and resolution of product.
     A2.11.1. Format. GR.PD[…]U[…], where P indicates the projection as indicated in Table
     A2.7., D[…] specifies the value of the grid size, and U[…] indicates the units of measure as
     indicated in Table A2.8 The value specified by D[…] uses as many digits as necessary to
     identify the grid spacing. A couple of examples may be in order. A 45km mid-latitude
     Lambert Conformal MM5 product grid would be identified as GR.L45KM, while an eighth-
     mesh (25nm) Polar Stereographic cloud forecast grid would be identified as GR.P25NM.
     For fractional values, a ‘P’ shall be used to signify the decimal point, since the decimal point
     is a reserved character. For example, two-and-a-half degree data in lat/lon projection would
     be represented as “GR.C2P5DEG”. For resolutions less than one unit of measure, ‘0’ shall

   precede the fractional specification. For example, half degree lat/lon data is specified as
   GR.C0P5DEG.

Section A2.12. – Generating Process.
A2.12. Generating Process. This identifies the process, model, or method creating the product.
   A2.12.1. Format. GP.X[…], where X[…] is one or a combination of the descriptors listed
   in Table A2.9. In the event that more than one descriptor could potentially describe the
   product, the order of precedence identified in Table A2.9 shall be followed. The lower the
   precedence number, the higher precedence it has. For example, if a forecaster produced a
   surface analysis chart based on the 0 hour forecast fields from GFS and used LEADS
   software to draw the features, FITL would be used, since its precedence is 1, while GFS’s is
   2, and LEAD’s is 3. In some cases, multiple descriptors may be needed to fully distinguish
   the product. In this case, the descriptors shall be separated by hyphen characters with higher
   precedence descriptors being in front (to the left) of lower precedence descriptors.

Section A2.13. – Level of Data.
A2.13. Level of Data. This identifies the single atmospheric level pertaining to the product.
   A2.13.1. Format. LV.SD[…][U…][-V…], where S indicates the type of level as indicated
   in Table A2.10., D[…] specifies the value of the level, [U…] indicates units of measure,
   where applicable as indicated in Table A2.11., and [-V…] indicates the vertical reference
   where applicable as indicated in Table A2.12. The value of the level uses as many digits as
   necessary to identify the level. The value “99999” shall be used to indicate multiple levels
   (not to be confused with a continuous layer, which would be handled by LY). For unit-less
   levels, such as sigma, the units of measure and vertical reference are not required. Examples
   may help clarify this element. A product containing soil moisture at 5cm would include
   “…LV.D5CM…” in its filename. A 500mb wind chart would include “…LV.P500MB…”.
   A product with flight level winds might include “…LV.H30000FT-AGL…”. An alternative
   format can be used to describe levels that are defined by something other than by vertical
   reference datum. For example, a product depicting freezing level would be labeled
   “LV.FRZ”, a product describing the tropopause would be labeled “LV.TROP”, and a product
   describing something at the surface would be labeled “LV.SFC”.
Note: This departs from the NCEP usage of level. The NCEP standard does not include the zeta
level type, nor does it include units of measure or vertical reference.

Section A2.14. – Layer of Data.
A2.14. Layer of Data. This indicates the range of levels pertaining to the product.
   A2.14.1. Format. LY.SD[…][U…][-V…]1-SD[…][U…][-V…]2, where SD[…][U…][-
   V…]1 identifies the bottom of the layer, and SD[…][U…][-V…]2 identifies the top of the
   layer. The top and bottom levels conform to the format specified in paragraph A2.13.1 and
   are separated by a hyphen, indicating a spatial interval. The value “99999” shall be used to
   indicate multiple layers. For example, a product containing low-level flight hazards might
   contain the following layer descriptor in its filename: “…LY.H0FT-AGL-H10000FT-
   AGL….”
Section A2.15. – Parameter.
A2.15. Parameter. This identifies the atmospheric parameter or product description detailed in
the product.
   A2.15.1. Format. PA.X[…], where X[…] is one or more of the descriptors identified in
   A2.15.2. For publications, the document title or name shall be used rather than the
   descriptors.
   A2.15.2. Descriptors. The parameter descriptors are taken from the Federal Aviation
   Administration’s (FAA) Contractions Manual, wherever possible. Where no FAA
   contraction is available, common practice among Air Force Weather forecasters prevails.
   The descriptors may be combined to fully describe product parameters. When multiple
   descriptors are used to define a single parameter, the hyphen (‘-‘) character shall be used to
   separate the descriptors. When multiple parameters make up a product, the parameters will
   be separated by plus signs (‘+’). This allows full identification of products containing
   multiple parameters. When multiple parameters are included in the product, they will be
   listed in the order presented in the following table to reduce the number of possible
   filenames. This should not be confused with a single parameter that requires multiple
   contractions to describe it, in which case the contractions should be used in the order which
   correctly describes the parameter. For example, pressure change would be represented by
   PA.PRES-CHG. An example of a product containing multiple parameters is PA.MAX-
   GST+PRES-CHG (maximum gust and pressure change). Table A2.13 contains the
   parameter descriptors, sorted alphabetically by parameter, rather than by descriptor, for ease
   of use.
Note: At the end of the table is a list of packaged parameter descriptors. These descriptors
identify standard packages of many parameters, as agreed to in Interface Control Documents or
Interface Specifications between AFWA and specific customers. Since the parameters are
agreed to in advance and the products contain a great number of parameters (sometimes in
excess of 90), this approach was taken to limit filename size. This parameter set naming
AFWAMAN15-3 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                23


convention may be extended to support custom parameter sets by a growing customer base.
Unique sets of parameters should always have unique descriptors to avoid confusion.

Section A2.16. – Publication Date.
A2.16. Publication Date. This identifies the date a publication was released. This field will
generally not be used for operational weather products, but rather for technical publications,
user’s manuals, etc.
Note: This element represents a departure from the NCEP standard, as that standard contains
nothing to represent this concept. This element was added largely in consideration of the need to
make available products maintained by the Air Force Weather Technical Library (AFWTL).
   A2.16.1. Format. PD.YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the two-
   digit month, and DD is the two-digit day. Month and day numbers requiring fewer digits will
   be zero filled.
Section A2.17. – Publication Number.
A2.17. Publication Number. This identifies the library number of a publication. This field
will generally not be used for operational weather products, but rather for technical publications,
user’s manuals, etc.
Note: This element represents a departure from the NCEP standard, as that standard contains
nothing to represent this concept. This element was added largely in consideration of the need to
make available products maintained by the AFWTL.
   A2.17.1. Format. PN.X[…], where X[…] is the alphanumeric string associated with the
   publication catalog number. The numbers may not contain underscore (‘_’) or period (‘.’)
   characters, as these characters are reserved for use as file element delimiters.
Section A2.18. – Product Source.
A2.18. Product Source. This identifies organization producing the product.
Note: This element represents a departure from the NCEP/FNMOC standard. It is similar to the
Server Location element employed by NCEP, but that element was not used in the AFWA
convention for a few reasons. First, it identifies the server, rather than the originator of the
product. To allow backup of the OWSs at AFWA, many products may reside on a server at
AFWA that were generated at a different location. Second, the implementation of Server
Location uses the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Common Code Table C-1
“Identification of originating/generating center” paired with locally defined sub-center codes to
identify the organization. While this unambiguously identifies an organization, it conflicts with
 30                                                            AFWAMAN15-3 8 JANUARY 2014


the NCEP/FNMOC stated decision to “rely more heavily on alphabetic rather than numeric
information elements” as outlined in their jointly developed standard. If the Server Location
element were used, for example to identify the 11th OWS, the following element would be
created: SL.US057080. This is not particularly human-readable, when compared to
“PS.11OWS” and requires knowledge of the WMO table and the AFWA-defined sub-center
values. While a computer would easily recognize either style of element, the AFWA Product
Source is more intuitive and more easily recognizable to an untrained individual. Finally, the use
of WMO center and sub-center does not allow identification of products produced at Combat
Weather Team locations, due to the limited number of sub-center IDs available.
   A2.18.1. Format. PS.X[…], where X[…] is one of the descriptors in Table A2.14, or the
   ICAO, WMO, or URSI identifier for the producing station. Each organization should
   consistently use only one descriptor.

Section A2.19. – Security Classification.
A2.19. Security Classification. This identifies security classification of product. This element
will only identify classification at a high level. More detailed classification information may be
contained within a product as governed by security policies and procedures.
Note: This element represents a departure from the NCEP/FNMOC standard, as that standard
does not have any method for identification of security classification.

Section A2.20. – Sequence Number.
A2.20. Sequence Number. This identifies a product’s placement in a series of related products.
Primarily used for animation loops. May also be used for packages containing multiple files
(e.g., TAR packages) to ensure package file does not overwrite previous packages. The
individual filenames contained inside the package should comply with the filename convention.
   A2.20.1. Format. SN.D[…], where D[…] is the sequence number, a variable length integer
   in the range 1 to n, where n represents the number of products in the sequence. To ensure
   correct sort order, the serial number descriptor should be padded with a sufficient number of
   zeros to represent the full sequence of files. For example, if an animation sequence will
   contain 12 products, the first product would be labeled as “SN.01” and the last as “SN.12”.
   For a sequence of products containing 100 products, the labels would be “SN.001” through
   “SN.100”.
Section A2.21. – Special Processing.
A2.21. Special Processing. This identifies special processing applied to a product
differentiating it from the standard product. This element will be used to uniquely identify a
non-standard product to avoid confusion with the standard product from a product line.
   A2.21.1. Format. SP.X[…], where X[…] is one of the descriptors in Table A2.16.

Table A2.16. Special Processing Descriptors.
Descriptor          Definition
INT                 Integer representation of floating point values. In some cases, floating
                    point values are reformatted to scaled integers for compactness. In these
                    products, the special processing element shall be used to distinguish the
                    product from the standard version.
NON-WMO             The product has been tailored to a non-WMO compliant format.

Section A2.22. – Data Time Period.
A2.22. Data Time Period. This identifies the range of times the product is valid. Data valid
times are always reported in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). (See also A2.2. Cycle of Run and
A2.9. Data Time.)
   A2.22.1. Format. TP. HH1MM1-HH2MM2, where HH1MM1 is the two-digit hour (in the
   range 00 to 23) and the two-digit minute (in the range 00-59) representing the start of the
   time period and HH2MM2 is the two-digit hour and the two-digit minute representing the end
   of the period. Hour and minute numbers requiring fewer digits will be zero filled.
