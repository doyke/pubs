SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision: updates school names and adds the USAF Test Pilot School as a degree-granting
school.

1. Policy. AU Diplomas 3 and 3A are used to award degrees and recognize completion of
academic programs and course work at AU. These diplomas are not used as certificates of
appreciation or certificates awarded by the 42d Air Base Wing. (The diploma currently used for
the IOS is exempt and will continue to be used.)

2. Description. AU Diploma 3 is printed on natural parchment and used for all resident
programs of 10 months’ duration or longer and the nonresident versions of such programs. AU
Diploma 3A is printed on white parchment and used for resident courses shorter than 10 months
and the nonresident versions of such programs. Both are general purpose diplomas with the gold
foil AU crest at the bottom and “Air University” arched across the top.

3. Procedures. Each school is responsible for procurement and appropriate overprint
information to include school name, wording, student name, program or course name, dates, and
signature blocks. Font size is not to exceed 48-point. Degree granting schools (School of
Advanced Air and Space Studies, Air War College, Air Command and Staff College, and USAF
Test Pilot School) coordinate with the AU Registrar the wording on diplomas of students earning
degrees.

    3.1. School Templates. Schools may request Diploma 3 or 3A be provided with certain
    overprint information already on the diploma, such as school name, wording, course name,
    and signature blocks (see Attachment 2). A DD Form 282, DOD Printing Requisition/Order,
    requesting the overprinting is prepared and routed through Document Automation and
    Production Service, Bldg 5688, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. An overlay must accompany
    the request, which should be submitted at least 45 days before needed.

4. Awarding Officials. Only school commandants or commanders and the AU Commander or
Vice Commander are authorized to sign AU diplomas and certificates of course completion.

5. Adopted Forms: DD Form 282, DOD Printing Requisition/Order; AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication.
