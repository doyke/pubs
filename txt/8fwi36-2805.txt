This instruction implements AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, and prescribes
nomination procedures for 8th Fighter Wing (8 FW) Pride of the Pack (PoP) awards. The PoP
awards program recognizes individuals who demonstrate superior performance or a one-time
meritorious act. Recognition of deserving individuals is a vital avenue for building a culture of
pride, performance and airmanship. This publication applies to all units in the 8 FW at Kunsan
AB, ROK. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route the AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System       (AFRIMS)      Records      Disposition      Schedule      (RDS)       located     at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. The use of the name or mark of any
specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not

1. Purpose: Pride of the Pack is a way for supervisors, squadrons, and groups to recognize
individuals for superior performance and for going above and beyond their required duties.
2. Eligibility: All military personnel assigned to 8 FW are eligible. Each squadron may select
an outstanding Airman. However, groups will review the squadron submissions and select one
for PoP nomination.
3. Selection Criteria:
   3.1. Key points to keep in mind when submitting individuals for this award:
 2                                                           8FWI36-2805 9 FEBRUARY 2012


        3.1.1. PoP is for individuals, not groups, to be recognized only for actions completed the
        week before (Monday through Sunday). 8 FW/CC can elect to recognize more than one
        individual as PoP for that week.
        3.1.2. Member being submitted must not have any UCMJ action within the last 90 days.
        3.1.3. As appropriate, each squadron/group may include additional requirements based
        upon their specific missions.
     3.2. Nominations are due to the 8 FW/CCCE box NLT COB the second duty day of the
     week (i.e. Tuesday for regular work weeks or Wednesday when Monday is a down
     day/holiday). PoP nominations may be suspended for one week due to wing OREs,
     inspections, or cancellation of Expanded Staff meeting. If this happens, you may use
     accomplishments from the week the program was suspended in the narrative when the PoP
     program resumes.
4. Selection Process:
     4.1. Wing Staff Agencies (WSA), Operations Group (OG), Maintenance Group (MXG),
     Mission Support Group (MSG) and Medical Group (MDG) Chiefs, using the selection
     criteria above and any additional criteria based upon respective missions, will select their
     PoP nominee.
     4.2. The Wolf Chief (8 FW/CCC) will recommend one winner from all nominees submitted
     by each group and announce them via e-mail. The e-mail will be sent to all group chiefs.
5. Recognition of Award Winners:
     5.1. The PoP winner will be honored at the weekly Expanded Staff Meeting. Invited
     attendees will include the award winners and their supervisor. A standard award certificate
     signed by the Wolf and a coin are presented to each award winner at this meeting.
     5.2. The award winners will also go on the “Wolf Show” typically scheduled for 0830 on the
     following morning, located at the Armed Forces Network (AFN) building. If the show is
     pushed back for any reason, the winner will be notified and rescheduled to attend the show at
     a later date.
