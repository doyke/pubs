1. General. The success or failure of any recognition program depends on the enthusiasm and
personal support provided by commanders and supervisors. The prestige and honor associated
with an individual’s selection are major contributing factors to this success. Providing or
withholding deserved recognition may greatly influence a person in deciding whether to accept
an additional service commitment. With high levels of competition and resultant quality
selection, this program can be an effective tool for enhancing unit morale and improving long-
term retention of needed Airmen.

   A2.2.6. Grade each nomination package, appearance, ability to answer questions and

   A2.3.2. The member must show this improvement through on- and off-duty education,
   achievements in professional or cultural societies or associations, and (or) development of

   might not know for certain whom the overall category winner is, you may develop a good
   idea based on the content of the packages and or board presentation. However, it is your
   duty to maintain secrecy. Don’t tell anyone until AFTER the awards banquet/luncheon.
   A2.5.4. An important benefit of serving as a board member is the knowledge you’ll gain of
   the process and the ability to improve your group’s competitiveness at future boards. Pass
   this insight on to your group and squadron. Let everyone know how to improve packages in
   the future.

A3.3. Ensure each achievement occurred during the inclusive period--if possible put date it
occurred

   member of AFSA, NCOA, Top Three, etc.”--examples without active participation mean
   little

the person was just nominated but did not win
A3.8. Check the instruction
   A3.8.1. Use the correct categories and put them in the correct order

   A3.10.3. Duty Titles--ensure the duty title matches the person’s personnel data sheet

award after award (i.e. “Flight NCO of the 1st Quarter”, “Squadron NCO of the 1st Quarter”,
