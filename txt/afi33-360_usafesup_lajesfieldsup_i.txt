                 AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS AND FORMS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for Air Force-wide publications and
forms management, to include the publishing process. Air Force units at all levels must ensure publica-
tions and forms are complete, accurate, current, and accessible to Air Force users.
   1.1.1. Official Air Force publications (those listed in Table 2.1. and processed in accordance with this
   instruction) are the only approved vehicles for issuing official Air Force policy and/or guidance. Air
   Force publications are either directive or non-directive in nature. Official Air Force publications com-
   municate policy, issue guidance and procedures, or simply serve to inform; those processed by
   AFDPO are accessible through the Air Force Portal (www.my.af.mil::Library::Publications::AF
   e-Publishing) and the e-Publishing website (www.e-publishing.af.mil, which will convert to
   www.af.mil/e-publishing on AF Link).
   1.1.2. Forms provide an expanded capability to manage the collection, storage, retrieval, and display
   of data. Official Air Force forms, with the exception of ANG forms and those generated below the
   wing/base level, are processed and disseminated in accordance with this publication; prescribed forms
   are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website. Official Air Force form types
   are defined in Section 3B.
   1.1.3. The publishing process includes tagging (formatting), posting, and storing electronic products;
   printing procurement for multi-color and unique physical products; the design of Air Force approved
   forms; and processing, storing, and disseminating physical products. Ultimately, publishing opera-
   tions are designed to provide customers Air Force-wide access to electronic and physical products via
   the e-Publishing website (via direct download or direct order). The website serves as the official
   repository for departmental and field publications at the wing/base level and above, prescribed forms
   at the wing/base level and above, and physical products down to the wing/base level that are pro-
   cessed by AFDPO. The National Guard Publications Management Center (NGB-DMJ-P) (http://
   www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm) is the official repository for all ANG products; head-
   quarters ANG publications will also be available on the e-Publishing website.

national employees, but not including contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and/

10                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     of the organization, the publications and forms managers may be separate positions. Smaller activities
     may not have the resources to support a full-time publications/forms manager (some FOAs, in partic-
     ular). Such activities should be supported by higher headquarters publications/forms management
     (thus eliminating the need for a local publications/forms manager) if that activity/organization agrees.
     Additionally, if a tenant on a base, the activity should, whenever possible, enter into a support agree-
     ment with the local publications/forms manager (see AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures).
     1.2.3. (USAFE) USAFE CSS/SCXM serves as the publication manager for all major command
     (MAJCOM) level publications and all publications created at the headquarters level (i.e. Headquarters
     Operating Instructions (HOI).
        1.2.3.1. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU organizations send the designee’s name, organizational des-
        ignation, office symbol, e-mail address, and telephone number to the SAF/AAX workflow box
        (safaax.workflow@pentagon.af.mil), with a courtesy copy to AFDPO (e-publishing@penta-
        gon.af.mil) and all subordinate publishing functions. Forward a copy of the support agreement or
        confirmation from a higher headquarters activity instead of a designee’s name, if applicable. Other
        organizations submit this information to the appropriate MAJCOM publishing manager.
        1.2.3.2. In conjunction with the publications/forms manager(s), determines who will maintain the
        official record sets for the organization’s publishing products.
        1.2.3.2. (USAFE) The USAFE Senior Communications and Information Manager has deter-
        mined that official master record sets for HQ USAFE, major command (MAJCOM) level publica-
        tions are maintained at USAFE CSS/SCXM and not with the office of primary responsibility
        (OPR). Exception: The official master record sets for classified publications are maintained by
        the OPR. The Publications Management Office only maintains a Record Set containing the signed
        AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request and any unclassified reference mate-
        rial.
     1.2.4. Publications/Forms Manager. Publications/forms managers at all levels are those designated
     as having overall responsibility for publications and forms within their Air Force organization. Listed
     in the table below are the functions they perform at each level.
        1.2.4.1. If the publications/forms manager function is contracted out or filled by an indirect-hire
        foreign national, the terms of that contract or employment agreement must be reviewed for legal
        and operational security soundness. Publications/forms managers have access to publications gen-
        erated within their activities and in other activities, so all legal and operational security concerns
        must be addressed before this function is performed by a contractor or an indirect-hire foreign
        national.

        1.2.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The MOB Communications Squadron Commander, in conjunc-
        tion with the MOB Publications Manager, determines who will maintain the official record
        sets for the organization’s publishing products. This determination must be documented and
        on file.

     1.2.4.3. (Added-USAFE) The Publications Managers’ areas of responsibility within the USAFE
     theater is sub-divided as follows:
        1.2.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE Publications Office (USAFE CSS/SCXM) supports
        and maintains all publications that originate at HQ USAFE (MAJCOM) level and apply to all
        units under the control of this headquarter. This also includes USAFE Headquarters Operating
        Instructions (HOI).
        1.2.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) MOB Publications Offices support and maintain all publications
        which originate at their Base and/or Wing level, unless a support agreement states otherwise.
        These publications apply to all units under the control of the issuing headquarters.
        1.2.4.3.2. (LAJES) Base Publication Manager will support and maintain all publications
        which originate at base level. This includes the official record sets for all Lajes Field Instruc-
        tions, Supplements and Visual Aids for the base. OPRs are required to keep a copy of the
        record set for all publications on which they hold ownership.
        1.2.4.3.3. (Added-USAFE) For any organization below the MOB level, which creates and
        releases guidance, the organization’s commander must designate an individual as the publica-
        tions point of contact (POC) to administer the organization’s official publications program
        (Operating Instructions (OI) and Guidance Memorandums (GM)) in accordance with AFI
        33-360 and this supplement. This is not required if the organization has a support agreement
        with a MOB publications officer. These publications apply only to personnel under the control
        of the issuing organization.
        1.2.4.3.3. (LAJES) Publishing Managers will be appointed within each squadron to act as
        liaison between Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and the Base Publications Manager.
        A letter of appointment will be forwarded to the Base Publication Manager within 30 days of
        appointment and will contain the minimum: names, grade, office symbol, extention and Date
        Eligible for Return From Overseas (DEROS).
           1.2.4.3.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The POC will maintain the record sets for all organizational
           guidance and will keep an index of all the current products.
           1.2.4.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The POC ensures annual reviews of all their organizations
           publishing products and documents this review in the record sets.
           1.2.4.3.3.3. (Added-USAFE) The POC reviews and coordinates on all organizational
           publishing products to ensure proper formatting, numbering, coordination, and processing
           in accordance with AFI 33-360 and the USAFE Supplement publishing standards.

                  1.2.4.3.3.4. (Added-USAFE) The POC ensures that organizational publishing products
                  only apply to their organization and do not task any function outside their organization.
                  This applicability must be stated in the opening paragraph (see paragraph 2.12.1.).
           1.2.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Should a unit or organization require official publications management
           support, they should enter into a support agreement with the appropriate publications office, if that
           activity/organization agrees. Example: If a direct reporting unit (DRU) is located on the Base and
           they do not have their own publishing office, they can request publishing support from the base
           publishing office, if that activity/organization agrees.
           1.2.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Review higher headquarters Product Announcements to ensure that all
           organizational supplements are current. Inform the OPR that in accordance with published policy
           the outdated supplement must be updated within 180 days or the publication will be removed from
           the publishing system. File this notification and any subsequent follow-up in the record set.

               obsolete or revised.

     1.2.5. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR): OPRs are solely responsible for the accuracy, cur-
     rency, and integrity of the contents and for compliance with their publications and forms:

     1.2.5.1. The OPR designates an individual within the office to serve as the Point of Contact
     (POC) for each publication and form. That individual will meet all OPR responsibilities, although
     the organization retains ultimate responsibility. The POC must be an Air Force civilian employee
     or a military member (including direct-hire foreign nationals but not indirect-hire foreign nation-
     als or contractors).
     1.2.5.2. The POC consults with their publications and forms management office before develop-
     ing a publication and/or form and at any point during the publishing process for guidance/advice.
     Adheres to publishing guidance and requirements contained in this Instruction.

     Section 2D).
     1.2.5.3. (USAFE) OPR’s must include a copy of the USAFE Coordination Matrix in the draft
     package routed for coordination. A copy of the Matrix is available on the Air Force Portal, at:
     h t t p s : / / w w w. m y. a f . m i l / g c s s - a f / a f p 4 0 / U S A F / e p / g l o b a l Ta b . d o ? c o m -
     mand=org&pageId=681742&channelPageId=-1117971 on the right side under “Publications
     Management”. Detailed guidelines on the usage and completion for the Matrix can be found in
     paragraph 1.2.8.4.2. (Added) and 2.18.2.11. through 2.18.2.11.4. (Added). The OPR must also
     explicitly specify whether the coordination is for a publication or jointly for a publication and a
     new/revised form. If it is a joint coordination, then a draft of the proposed from must be included
     in the package routed for coordination. If this fact is not clearly stated, the provided proof of coor-
     dination will be for a publication only.
         1.2.5.3.1. The POC resolve all critical comments before the publication or form may be sub-
         mitted for final processing and publishing.
         1.2.5.3.2. If the AF Form 673 or the AF IMT 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS), contains coor-
         dination more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft contents have been
         made, POCs must state in block 32 of the AF Form 673 that no recoordination is necessary
         before the certifying and approval officials sign the form. If significant changes have been
         made the POC must reaccomplish coordination.
     1.2.5.4. Based on the guidance in AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, the
     POC recommends a level of accessibility for the publication: post on the e-Publishing website (a
     public site), or restrict access. Departmental classified and FOUO publications will be automati-
     cally scheduled for printing; discuss production alternatives with the publications/forms manager
     if a printed product is not ideal. Unclassified titles for departmental and field-generated FOUO
     and classified publications must be included in the Product Index and in the publications listing on
     the e-Publishing website.
     1.2.5.5. The POC keeps existing publications and prescribed forms current. Submits cancellation
     requests to the publications/forms manager on the AF Form 673 after obtaining certification and
     approval.
     1.2.5.5. (USAFE) OPR’s with supplements to higher headquarters publications are responsible
     for reviewing the Air Force e-Publishing website and Product Announcements for notification
     when the higher headquarters publications are updated to ensure their supplements are either
     updated or verified to the publications manager within 180 days.

         1.2.5.6. The POC informs designated publications/forms manager using AF Form 673, Air Force
         Publication/Form Action Request, when transferring responsibility for a publication or form to
         another organization (see paragraph 2.22.4.).
         1.2.5.6. (USAFE) Office Symbol Changes. The OPR is required to notify the Publications Man-
         agement Office when reorganizations occur and submit the new, approved office symbol for each
         publication on which they are the OPR, within 30 calendar days of reorganization.
         1.2.5.7. HAF OPRs keep official record sets for publications and forms (see paragraph 2.31.4.1.).
         1.2.5.7. (USAFE) The OPR is required to keep a copy of the record set for all publications, on
         which they hold ownership. The MAJCOM publication office keeps and maintains the official,
         original master record sets for all USAFE level publications. Exception: For classified publica-
         tions see paragraph 1.2.3.2. MOB level record sets will be maintained in accordance with Para-
         graph 1.2.4.2.1. (Added). The publications POC’s for guidance below the MOB level will
         maintain the original record set.
         1.2.5.8. The POC ensures the proposed publication does not conflict with or unnecessarily dupli-
         cate higher headquarters policies or procedures.
         1.2.5.9. The POC fields questions related to the publication or form, and evaluates proposed
         changes to the publication or form.
         1.2.5.10. The POC receives, evaluates, and staffs waiver requests, elevating within the organiza-
         tion for review and approval as necessary.
     1.2.6. Certifying Officials. The certifying official is a minimum of one organizational level above
     the OPR (as opposed to the POC) and certifies the need for the publication, to include currency of
     information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content by signing the AF Form 673 at
     block 19. If the certifier one level above the OPR is the approval authority, the director/head of the
     POC’s organization should serve as the certifying official. Note: Before signing the AF Form 673, it
     is the responsibility of the certifying official to make sure the publication is not less restrictive than the
     higher headquarters publication. If needed, it can be more restrictive.
     1.2.6. (LAJES) Certifying approval at Lajes Field is designated as the group commander of the OPR
     (Commander, 65 Medical Group (65 MDG/CC), Commander, Mission Support Group (65 MSG/CC),
     for wing staff agencies, Vice Commander, Air Base Wing (65 ABW/CV)).
         1.2.6.1. Departmental publications authored by a field unit (e.g., a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU)
         must be certified by an individual at the HAF and approved by the appropriate HAF two-letter. AF
         Policy Directives (AFPDs), AF Policy Memorandums (AFPMs), and AF Supplements to DOD
         Directives (DODDs) must be approved by the SECAF.
         1.2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Publications authored by an OPR at a lower echelon, however applica-
         ble to personnel above the OPR’s area of responsibility, must be signed by the Certifier at the
         appropriate level. Example: OPR is at Third Air Force (3AF), however the publication applies to
         all USAFE personnel, then it must be issued as a USAFE level publication and the Certifier must
         be at HQ USAFE.
     1.2.7. Approving Officials.
         1.2.7.1. Approving officials are senior leaders responsible for policies and guidance/procedures
         pertaining to their functional areas (e.g., heads of functional two-letter offices, acting heads of
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                      17


     two-letter offices, and deputy heads if the 2-digit is unable to provide approval). Note: Establish-
     ing Air Force-wide policy is an authority that rests solely with The Secretary of the Air Force
     (SECAF), who will review, authenticate, approve, and rescind all AFPDs, AFPMs, and AF Sup-
     plements to DODDs. Approval officials at all levels will:
     1.2.7.1. (USAFE) If Block 21 and 22 of AF Form 673 does not contain the information of the 2
     letter functional principal (Director), then the complete signature block of the Director must be
     listed in Block 32.
     1.2.7.1. (LAJES) Approval authority rest with the Commander, Air Base Wing (65 ABW/CC)
     for all base publications.
        1.2.7.1.1. Enforce procedures and guidance contained in publications within their functional
        area(s).
        1.2.7.1.2. Approve publications within their functional area (those Air Force Specialty Codes
        (AFSCs) associated with their organizations) by signing the AF Form 673 at block 22, which
        verifies information in the publication and identifies publication restrictions. In signing the AF
        Form 673, the approval authority is also confirming that the information therein is by order of
        the SECAF or Commander, as appropriate. The functional principal’s authentication (signa-
        ture block (not signature): name, rank, and title) appears on the last page of the publication
        before the attachments. The SECAF will always be the approval authority on AFPDs and AF
        supplements to DODDs.
        1.2.7.1.3. Approve, as the Air Force original classification authority (OCA), all security clas-
        sification guidance contained in a publication. The OCA ensures the classification guidance
        complies with AFI 31-401. Departmental classified and FOUO publications will be automati-
        cally scheduled for printing; discuss production alternatives with the publications/forms man-
        ager if a printed product is not ideal.
        1.2.7.1.4. Determine the need to delegate approval authority and functional coordination for
        revisions of existing publications. Note: The approval authority may not be delegated for new
        publications, and may not be delegated below the HAF. If the approving authority for revi-
        sions or cancellations is delegated, the signature block in the publication must be that of the
        functional principal (or SECAF, in the case of AFPDs, AF supplements to DODDs, and
        AFPMs).
        1.2.7.1.4. (USAFE) At USAFE this delegation can not be delegated below headquarters level.
            1.2.7.1.4.1. Ensure the delegation of approval authority, whether for a single publication
            or a blanket request for several publications, is in writing, signed, and dated, and either
            accompanies the AF Form 673 and the revised draft or remains on file with the publica-
            tions/forms manager.
     1.2.7.2. (Added-USAFE) Publications authored by an OPR at a lower echelon, however applica-
     ble to personnel above the OPR’s area of responsibility, must be issued and signed by the
     Approval Authority at the appropriate level. Example: OPR is at third Air Force (3AF), however
     the publication applies to all USAFE personnel, then it must be issued as a USAFE level publica-
     tion and the approval authority must be a HQ USAFE functional director.
  1.2.8. Mandatory and Technical/Functional Coordinators.
18                               AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     1.2.8.1. Mandatory and technical/functional coordinators are responsible for reviewing and pro-
     viding coordination on publications and forms from their particular functional perspective or area
     of expertise based on the rules established in the coordination tables (Table 2.2., Table 2.3., and
     Table 3.2.).
     1.2.8.2. Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter organizations, unless otherwise
     directed in the coordination tables. Two-letters are responsible for ensuring the correct offices
     within the organization review and coordinate on the publication and/or form and for pro-
     viding a consolidated response. The consolidated response does not necessarily have to carry
     a two-letter level signature; the two-letter may designate a lower-level office within the orga-
     nization to provide the response and sign off on the coordination form provided (i.e., the AF
     Form 673 or the AF IMT 1768, Staff Summary Sheet).
        1.2.8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE Directorates/Staff must ensure that coordination cor-
        respondence is in compliance with the current USAFE Action Officer Guide.
        1.2.8.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Any unit below HQ USAFE must follow local guidance for the
        creation of official correspondence, or AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.
     1.2.8.3. If a mandatory or technical/functional organization is not able to meet the suspense date
     for coordination, a request for an extension must be submitted to the OPR.
     1.2.8.4. Coordination may be provided on the AF Form 673, the AF IMT 1768 provided by the
     OPR, or via email. Use a continuation sheet, if necessary.
        1.2.8.4.1. In providing concurrence, reviewers agree to the contents within a publication/form
        from a functional perspective. Additionally, reviewers are agreeing to the releasability of the
        publication, as stated by the OPR in the publication. If the contents or purpose of a publication/
        form are in conflict with existing policy or guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the pub-
        lication is not in keeping with guidance in AFI 31-401, reviewers must provide feedback to the
        OPR accordingly.
        1.2.8.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Any coordination resulting in comments without concurrence,
        must be recorded on the USAFE Publications Coordination Matrix and returned to the OPR. A
        copy of the Matrix can be found on the USAFE Publishing Web Page, located on the Air Force
        Portal at: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/afp40/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?com-
        mand=org&pageId=681742&channelPageId=-1117971 on the right side under “Publica-
        tions Management”.
            1.2.8.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If several mandatory coordinating functions are combined
            under one office symbol, then the coordinating response must specifically list each func-
            tion for which coordination is provided. Example: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
            and Records Management are combined under one office symbol; then the response must
            read: “FOIA coordinates without comments” and “Records Management coordinates with-
            out comments.”

                                            PUBLICATIONS

Section 2A—Research and Applicability

2.1. Planning and Research. Inadequate research on new publications or revisions could result in issu-
ing more than one publication on the same subject, conflicting instructions, or publishing a nonessential
or incomplete publication. Check the e-Publishing website to find out if any other publication has a simi-
lar subject. If there is a related publication, consider consolidation. Obtain inputs from subordinate activ-
ities during the drafting process and add all suitable information to reduce the need for additional
implementing publications. Regularly review publications for administrative changes (such as change in
organization symbols, office realignment, OPR, etc.). Carefully review this Instruction for guidance on
selecting the right publication/form type, formatting standards, coordination requirements, and maintain-
ing the publication or form.

2.2. Validity of a Publication. Official Air Force publications (those listed in Table 2.1. and processed
in accordance with this instruction) are the only approved vehicles for issuing official Air Force policy
and/or guidance. The e-Publishing website is the official repository for Air Force publications and forms
at the wing/base level and above for activities supported by AFDPO; unless cited as an exception in this
AFI those not listed on the e-Publishing website down to the wing/base level are not considered official
policy or guidance. NGB-DMJ-P (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm) is the official
repository for ANG products. POCs, certifying officials, and approving officials for Air Force publica-
tions must be either military members or civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign nationals, but
not including contractors or indirect-hire foreign nationals). When an approving official vacates his or her
position, publications showing the individual’s signature element remain in effect until rescinded or
rewritten. When a unit reorganizes, current publications remain valid and in effect until superseded or
rescinded.

2.3. Conflicting Publications. When guidance in a publication issued by a field unit conflicts with the
guidance issued by a higher-level unit, the higher-level publication takes precedence.
   2.3.1. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the activity not-
   ing the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs highlighting the conflict and
   requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working with each other to deconflict and issue the
   correct publication(s).
   2.3.2. If a field activity notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters publications, submit an
   AF IMT 847 to both OPRs, following the chain of command, as appropriate. AF IMT 847s submitted
   for HAF publications must be sent through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

2.4. Applicability of Publications to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.
   2.4.1. Applicability of Departmental Publications to AFRC Units. All departmental publications
   requiring mandatory coordination must be reviewed for applicability to AFRC Units. Electronic coor-
   dination may be obtained by submitting the draft publication to the AF/RE workflow inbox. The pri-
   mary POC within AF/RE is responsible for obtaining coordination from other interested staff offices
   within AF/RE. The OPR of the publication must include a statement of applicability in the opening
20                                   AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     paragraph of the draft. AF/RE will either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability or
     supply a new statement. Note: As the Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications
     should be written to support the functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members, including
     Reserve forces. However, when AF/RE takes exception to specific portions of a publication due to
     dissimilarities with the way the Reserve community operates, the OPR will not publish it until all
     exceptions are resolved. OPRs will require justification from AF/RE when exception is taken. Send
     unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office for resolution, in accordance with
     AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces. Statements of applicability are
     as follows:
        2.4.1.1. When the entire publication applies, include the following statement: “This publication
        applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.”
        2.4.1.2. When only specific portions apply, include a statement such as “Chapter [or paragraph—
        include specific number(s)] of this publication apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
        Units.”
        2.4.1.3. When only specific portions do not apply include a statement such as “This publication
        applies to Air Force Reserve Command units, with the exception of [list the portions that do not
        apply].”
        2.4.1.4. If the entire publication does not apply, include the following statement: “This publica-
        tion does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.”
     2.4.2. Applicability of MAJCOM Publications to AFRC Units. All new and rewritten MAJCOM
     publications must be reviewed for applicability to AFRC Units. Electronic coordination may be
     obtained by clicking on the “Gaining Command Publication Coordination” link located on the AFRC
     secure homepage at https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil. Go to the “Headquarters” button, find the “Gaining
     Command and RE Coords” and request coordination from the appropriate functional. The primary
     POC within AFRC is responsible for obtaining coordination from other staff offices within AFRC as
     appropriate. The OPR of the publication must include a statement of applicability in the opening para-
     graph of the draft. AFRC will either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability (selected
     from statements provided in 2.4.1.1.–2.4.1.4.) or supply a new statement. Note: As the Air Force
     moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be written to support the functioning of all
     types of Air Force employees/members, including Reserve forces. However, when the AFRC takes
     exception to specific portions of a publication due to dissimilarities with the way AFRC operates, the
     OPR will not publish it until all exceptions are resolved. OPRs will require justification from AFRC
     when exception is taken. Send unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office for
     resolution, in accordance with AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces.
        2.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The mandatory coordination with Air Force Reserve Command
        (AFRC) units does not apply to publications below the MAJCOM level. This includes HQ
        USAFE HOI’s, because they are only applicable to USAFE headquarters staff.
     2.4.3. If changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the applicability to
     reserve units, the OPR must re-coordinate with AF/RE for departmental publications, and AFRC for
     MAJCOM publications.
     2.4.4. If changes to the applicability publication occur after release (from an interim change or a
     rewrite), AF/RE or AFRC must submit an AF IMT 847 to the OPR of the publication if the changes
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                      21


   affect the applicability status of the publication. OPRs receiving an AF/RE or an AFRC request to
   change the applicability statement within a publication must comply.

2.5. Applicability of Departmental and Field Publications to the Air National Guard (ANG):
   2.5.1. All new and rewritten departmental and MAJCOM publications must be sent to the ANG for
   review. If a lower-level field publication affects the ANG, the publication must be routed to ANG for
   review as part of the technical/functional review. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) authorized the
   ANG to review and approve ANG publications without additional NGB review. Exception: The
   NGB will review and approve all Interservice Publications; however, the process for Air Force OPRs
   remains the same. All publications will be submitted to ang.pubs@me.ngb.army.mil; ANG will
   ensure Air Force and Interservice publications are disseminated to the appropriate reviewers within
   ANG/NGB.
       2.5.1.1. The ANG determines whether a publication applies, not the authoring OPR. Note: As the
       Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be written to support the
       functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members, including ANG forces. However, when
       the ANG takes exception to specific portions of a publication due to dissimilarities with the way
       ANG operates, the ANG will provide applicability or exception statements to the OPR of the pub-
       lication for inclusion in the opening paragraph. OPRs will require justification from the ANG
       when exception is taken. Examples of opening paragraph statements are: “This publication applies
       to the Air National Guard (ANG),” “This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard
       (ANG),” or “This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) only upon mobilization.”
       2.5.1.2. When an existing ANG and an applicable departmental or MAJCOM publication con-
       flict, the ANG publication governs until the OPR and appropriate ANG Chief resolve the conflict.
       Resolve conflicts at the MAJCOM-level by including either an ANG-specific chapter or publish-
       ing a replacement ANG publication.
       2.5.1.3. If there are numerous exceptions, additions, or inclusions to a proposed publication, ANG
       will publish a separate publication. ANG will publish supplements identified as ANG supplements
       to both departmental and MAJCOM publications, using the same numerical designation as the
       parent publication.
       2.5.1.4. Only the publications listed by series and date in the ANG Master Catalog apply to ANG
       (online at https://airguard.ang.af.mil/angpubs). The ANG OPR notifies the NGB publications
       manager, through the Director of the Air Guard (NGB/CF), of revisions to publications.
   2.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The mandatory coordination with Air National Guard (ANG) units does not
   apply to publications below MAJCOM level. This includes HQ USAFE HOI’s, because they are only
   applicable to USAFE headquarters staff.

2.6. Applicability of Departmental and MAJCOM Publications to the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). T h e
CAP is the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. In this capacity, the CAP performs
Air Force missions as approved in the AFPD 10-27, Civil Air Patrol, and AFI 10-2701, Organization and
Function of the Civil Air Patrol. Coordination of publications relating to noncombat missions is highly
encouraged. Approval of policies and procedures affecting the auxiliary must follow the normal chain of
command.
2.7. Types of Publications




                                                                                                                                                                                 22
Table 2.1. Publications Types and Descriptions. Official Air Force publications (those listed in this table and processed in accordance
with this instruction) are the only approved vehicles for issuing official Air Force policy and/or guidance. Unless otherwise identified in
the table, all publication types require an AF Form 673 and maintenance of a record set.
Directive publications are necessary to meet the requirements of law, safety, security, or other areas where common direction and standardization benefit the air force. Air
force personnel must comply with these publications. All publications in this category must carry the following statement in the publication header: “COMPLIANCE
WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY.” Note: the e-publishing website does not post products below wing/base level, although unless otherwise noted in this
table all products except ANG products must be listed in the product index. ANG products are located at the NGB-DMJ-P (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/

NOTES:
1. Periodicals are no longer recognized as part of the publishing program. Periodicals are managed by the author’s functional organization
   and published on local websites. Newspapers and commercial enterprise publications are authorized by and subject to the guidance in AFI
   35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. Local webmasters are responsible for ensuring Section 508 compliance. “Policy letters”
   are commonly used by unit-level commanders to reemphasize or reiterate commanders’ views, vision, or analysis of subjects otherwise
   established in official publications. “Policy letters,” guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the publishing program; any guid-




                                                                                                                                                              AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008
   ance or information issued in a policy letter, guide, or bulletin requiring implementation or compliance must be established in a publica-
   tion type described in this instruction and processed accordingly.
2. Some non-DOD publications issued by an external agency or entity direct action within the Air Force. Generally, non-DOD publications
   are directed to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and redelegated within DOD publications, memorandums, etc. Air Force action is
   regularly directed by the following: Executive Orders (Eos); Public Laws; Federal Management Regulations; Office of Management and
   Budget (OMB) bulletins, circulars, and notices; Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regula-
   tions; Department of Commerce (DOC) circulars, bulletins, and notices; Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications; National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications; General Accounting Office (GAO) publications; and others.
3. Unless otherwise noted in this table, all publications and forms must be listed in the Product Index on the e-Publishing website.
   Classified and FOUO publications and forms must be listed under an unclassified title.

Note 1: The replacement tool for the field on issuing Policy Letters/Policy Memorandums is the Guidance Memorandum (GM); however they
must also be processed through the Publishing Office and replaced by a valid publication within 180 days of date of issuance.
Note 2: Publications Managers must establish a suspense system to track the 180 days validation period of Guidance Memorandums (GM)
and after that time frame has expired take appropriate action.
Note 3: Interservice Publications (IP): When USAFE is the lead service: It is the OPR’s responsibility to obtain the mandatory
coordination, the publication number and the approving authorities signature block from the joint military departments, and provide this
information to the Publications Manager for inclusion in the official publication. Without this information the publication cannot be
processed/released.

Section 2B—Developing a Publication

2.8. Content Limitations and Restrictions.
     2.8.1. Only civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign national employees, but not including
     contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and/or military members of the Air Force are
     authorized to serve as the POC for, provide coordination on, certify, and /or approve official Air Force
     publications and forms, including interservice publications where the Air Force serves as the lead ser-
     vice.
     2.8.2. AFPDs and AF supplements to DODDs may only be directly implemented by AFIs and
     AFMANs. DOD Issuances may only be directly supplemented or implemented by a department-level
     publication. Unless otherwise noted in the opening paragraph, all other publications may be supple-
     mented. Exception: If no departmental-level guidance is provided (e.g., AFIs, AFMANs, etc.), field
     activities may issue field instructions to directly implement AFPDs and AF supplements to DODDs.
     Once higher headquarters guidance is published, the field activity must rescind its instruction and
     issue a supplement to the higher headquarters guidance.
        2.8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If Department of Defense (DoD) issuance is directly supplemented; the
        OPR is responsible to follow guidance in paragraph 2.9.2. of the basic publication and in addition
        obtain the Headquarters, United States Air Force (HQ/USAF) functional counterpart coordination.
     2.8.3. A publication applies only to the issuing headquarters’ staff elements and its subordinate activ-
     ities (i.e. an AFI issued at the HAF applies Air Force-wide; an AFMCI applies only to AFMC and
     units subordinate to AFMC; an AMC supplement applies only to AMC and units subordinate to
     AMC).
     2.8.4. Implementing Technical Orders (T.O.). If authorized by T.O. managers, process MAJCOM and
     base-level T.O. supplements through your supporting publication function. AFPD 21-3, Technical
     Orders, and T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System, contain special instructions and limita-
     tions on issuing supplements.
     2.8.5. When a higher headquarters publication is updated (either by an interim change or a rewrite),
     implementing publications (such as supplements) must be rewritten, updated, or, if applicable, certi-
     fied as current within 180 days (see paragraphs 2.22.3. and 2.24.1. on certifying a publication as cur-
     rent). Publications/forms managers may use the AF Form 399 to alert OPRs of changes to higher
     headquarters publications. Publishing managers will fill out the top half of the form, using the “special
     instructions” block to tell the OPR how to access the publication and to note the type of action taken
     on the higher headquarters publication (e.g., revised, rescinded, amended using a GM, etc.). OPRs
     will fill out the bottom half in response. An AF Form 673 must accompany any final requests for
     action by the OPR. Implementing publications not updated within 180 days will be removed from the
     e-Publishing website, and the publications manager will be notified. Note: If the implementing publi-
     cation conflicts with the higher headquarters publication, the implementing publication must immedi-
     ately be rescinded and removed from the website. OPRs may issue a GM to replace the conflicting
     publication, or add new guidance to non-conflicting implementing publications while the publication
     is under revision. GMs used to replace or amend implementing publications will expire when the sup-
     plement is revised (must be within 180 days). Expired GMs—those exceeding 180 days—will be
     removed from the e-Publishing website and the publications manager will be notified. Note: “Policy
     letters,” guides, and bulletins are not recognized as part of the publishing program; any guidance or
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                          35


   information issued in a policy letter, guide, or bulletin requiring implementation/compliance must be
   established in a publication type described in this instruction and processed accordingly.
   2.8.6. Do not put the following in your publication:
       2.8.6.1. Articles intended only to encourage or obtain the support of persons outside the Govern-
       ment.
       2.8.6.2. Editorials, book reviews, or articles that are political, representing clear attempts to lobby
       for or against legislation or increased appropriations.
       2.8.6.3. Partisan political campaign articles or editorials.

2.9. Supplements. In order to minimize the release of conflicting guidance and duplicate information,
Air Force activities add organization-specific guidance to higher headquarters publications by issuing
supplements to implement higher headquarters publications, rather than issuing separate publications (see
Table 2.1.). Supplementary guidance cannot be less restrictive than the basic publication, but it can be
more restrictive. Supplementary guidance must not contradict the basic publication.
   2.9.1. Supplementing Air Force Publications. Field supplements may either be issued as an inte-
   grated publication or as a “standalone” publication. The integrated method, where local content is
   inserted into the higher headquarters publication, enables the user to see higher headquarters and new
   material in one integrated file—OPRs are strongly encouraged to utilize this format, as it is most con-
   venient for readers. The standalone method only includes supplementary material; users will have to
   read standalone supplements alongside the higher headquarters publication. If an integrated supple-
   ment is produced, that version will be posted to the e-Publishing website; if no integrated version is
   produced, the standalone version will be posted to the e-Publishing website. The supplement will be
   submitted the same way, regardless of what format the OPR selects; AFDPO will integrate the supple-
   mentary material with the higher headquarters publication, or not, based on the OPR’s request as
   stated on the AF Form 673 (block 32). Note: If the OPR fails to specify a particular format, an inte-
   grated version will be produced.
       2.9.1.1. AFPDs, AF supplements to DODDs, and AFPMs may not be supplemented. DOD Issu-
       ances may not be directly supplemented in the field, because a direct supplement carries the same
       weight as a departmental publication. Unless otherwise stated in the opening paragraph, all other
       publications may be supplemented. Exception: If no departmental-level guidance is provided (e.g.
       AFIs, AFMANs, etc.), commands may issue command instructions to directly implement AFPDs
       and AF supplements to DODDs. Once higher headquarters guidance is published, the command
       must rescind its instruction and issue a supplement to the higher headquarters guidance.
           2.9.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If an Air Force Supplement to a DoD issuance must be supple-
           mented, then the OPR must also obtain the coordination of the HQ USAF functional counter-
           part.
       2.9.1.2. Follow guidance starting at paragraph 2.12. to format your supplement.
           2.9.1.2.1. In addition to formatting requirements established in 2.12., the following applies to
           supplements: insert the name of the activity followed by the word “supplement” below the
           short title of the publication (e.g., Air Force Supplement, Air Mobility Command Supplement,
           21st Space Wing Supplement). Create the publication header, an opening statement, and a
           summary of changes (if applicable) as mandated in paragraph 2.12. and place before the higher
36                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


           headquarters publication’s header. Integrated supplements will also show the header for the
           higher headquarters publication; the header for the higher headquarters publication will
           remain unchanged, including the Seal and the publication date. Contact AFDPO-PPP for a
           sample formatted supplement.
           2.9.1.2.2. OPRs of standalone supplements must identify the higher headquarters publication
           in the opening paragraph and direct users to read the standalone supplement in conjunction
           with the publication being supplemented. OPRs are responsible for ensuring they are supple-
           menting the current version of the higher headquarters publication.
        2.9.1.3. Supplements must bear the higher headquarters designator and number, adding the field
        acronym and “SUP” to the end (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP,
        AFI33-360_89AWSUP (if AMC does not issue a supplement)). Publications/forms managers will
        approve numbers before processing the final publication.
     2.9.2. Supplementing DOD Publications. See AFI 90-101 for more guidance on developing this
     type of supplement.
        2.9.2.1. Obtain an electronic file of the DOD material from the OPR or the Washington Head-
        quarters Services (WHS) website (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/) and insert the Air Force
        supplementary material.
        2.9.2.2. Print the DOD material word for word, without editing and retaining the paragraph num-
        bering and formatting. Added Air Force material must meet standards in this Instruction. DOD
        text should be in regular font, with Air Force text in bold font; state that DOD text appears in reg-
        ular font and Air Force text appears in bold font in the opening paragraph.
        2.9.2.3. AF supplements to DOD Issuances will be identified by both the DOD Issuance number
        and an AF publication number, in that order. AF supplements to DODDs will be assigned an
        AFPD number, AF supplements to DODIs will be assigned an AFI number, AF supplements to
        DOD Regulations or Manuals will be assigned an AFMAN number (e.g. DODD 8000.1_AFPD
        33-1). Show this on the cover, if used, and in the upper right corner of the title page.
        2.9.2.4. Following guidance in paragraph 2.12., insert the Air Force publication header, including
        the opening paragraph and the summary of changes, if applicable, before the original DOD mate-
        rial. The DOD material must remain unchanged, including the DOD front matter (the Seal, title,
        publication date, etc.). Also identify the DOD publication you are supplementing in the opening
        paragraph.
           2.9.2.4.1. OPRs for AF supplements to DOD issuances must format their own publication
           header (paragraph 2.12.) and provide AFDPO, the publishing manager for departmental publi-
           cations generated at the HAF, with a .pdf file of the integrated supplement for posting. Contact
           AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil) for sample front matter.
        2.9.2.5. OPRs must place “(Added)(AF)” before supplementary material of any type (paragraphs,
        chapters, tables, attachments, etc.), with the exception of front matter material; e.g., “(Added)(AF)
        Within HAF . . .” OPRs must include added material (chapters, main paragraphs, figures, etc.) in
        the table of contents, if used.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       37


2.10. Select a Subject Series. All Air Force publications are related to an Air Force specialty code
(AFSC); see Attachment 3 for descriptions. Note: All directive departmental publications that issue
guidance must have an antecedent AFPD, AF supplement to a DODD, or AFPM.
   2.10.1. If the publication is new, select the series that most closely describes the function.
   2.10.2. If the publication is a rewrite, it bears the same series and control number as the superseded
   publication. If the publication implements an existing Air Force publication, it carries the same series
   number as the higher headquarters publication.
   2.10.3. If you are consolidating two or more publications, either use one of the publication numbers
   and supersede both, or request a new control number and supersede both. Note: If you are consolidat-
   ing publications, you must “own” them all or have written concurrence on the consolidation from the
   owning organization. Ensure the statement of concurrence clearly indicates the organization that will
   own the consolidated publication. Also ensure that any implementing/supplementary publications are
   updated (via IC or rewrite) to show the new publication number if the series or number of the parent
   publication changes.
   2.10.4. Departmental. Once you have identified your series, AFDPO will create and assign a unique
   publication control number. If the publication will become a physical (printed) product and has a sep-
   arate cover, place the series number and title on the cover as well as on the first page of the publica-
   tion.
       2.10.4.1. AFPMs and AFGMs issuing new guidance that will not be incorporated into an existing
       publication will be numbered consecutively under the appropriate subject series (e.g.,
       AFGM33-01). An AFPM or AFGM that amends an existing publication will carry the amended
       publication’s number followed by the appropriate acronym and number (e.g., the first GM that
       issues guidance amending AFI 33-360 would be numbered AFI33-360_AFGM1, the second to
       amend AFI33-360 would be numbered AFI33-360_AFGM2, etc.).
       2.10.4.2. Publications implementing a particular AFPD or AF supplement to a DoDD should fall
       in the same numbered series and have a three-digit control number (e.g. AFI 65-701 is the first
       publication that implements AFPD 65-7). Publications that follow/support the implementing pub-
       lication will have consecutive control numbers (e.g. AFI 33-360 will further be implemented by
       AFMAN 33-361).
       2.10.4.3. Air Force supplements to DOD Issuances will bear the DOD number and an Air Force
       publication number (e.g. DODD 8000.1_AFPD 33-1; DODI 1000.15_AFI 34-223).
   2.10.5. Field (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Base/Wing). Once the series has been identified, the publica-
   tions/forms manager assigns the control number. Field publications will be numbered consecutively
   under the subject series using at least a 3-digit control number (some publications will have a 4-digit
   control number).
       2.10.5.1. GMs issuing new guidance that will not be incorporated into an existing publication will
       be numbered consecutively under the appropriate subject series (e.g., ACCGM33-01,
       AFMCGM33-01, etc.). A GM that amends an existing publication will carry the amended publi-
       cation’s number followed by the appropriate acronym and number (e.g., the first GM that issues
       guidance amending AFI33-360_ACCSUP would be numbered AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM1,
       the second to amend AFI33-360_ACCSUP would be numbered
       AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2, etc.).
38                                    AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


        2.10.5.2. Supplements must bear the higher headquarters designator and number, adding the field
        acronym to the end and “SUP” (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP,
        AFI33-360_89AWSUP (if AMC does not issue a supplement)).
        2.10.5.3. (Added-USAFE) All publications managers must follow the publications control num-
        ber guidance provided in paragraph 2.10.4.2. and Attachment 3. Maintain a spreadsheet (or any
        other method) to track the numbers, as they are assigned. This spreadsheet enables the Publica-
        tions Manager to track the already assigned control numbers, and prevents the reissue of a control
        number until two years, since the rescission of that control number, have passed.

2.11. Select a Title. When developing a new publication, select a meaningful, concise title. Use only
commonly known abbreviations, such as “US.” Do not use terms such as “policy,” “instruction,” “guid-
ance,” “handbook,” “pamphlet,” “catalog,” “guide,” or “book,” etc., in the title for that type of publica-
tion. If supplementing a higher headquarters publication at the HAF or in the field, maintain the title of the
original publication.

2.12. Format the Draft. Drafts are for development and coordination only, not for implementation or
compliance. Drafts may be circulated to inform users of forthcoming changes, but OPRs may never
release draft content with instructions to comply. Users are not required to comply until content is certi-
fied, approved, and posted/released. Each draft must be marked “DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTA-
TION OR COMPLIANCE” across the top of each page. Reference, the GPO Style Manual, and DOD
5025.1-M, DOD Directives System Procedures, for additional guidance on writing style, grammar, for-
matting, etc. See paragraph 2.25.2.3. for guidance on formatting ICs and paragraph 2.26. for guidance on
formatting ACs.
     2.12.1. Content in publications must be ordered as follows: publication header, opening paragraph;
     summary of changes (if applicable); table of contents (if applicable—see note); “overview” or “back-
     ground” information; detailed responsibilities; core content; attachments (if the OPR intends to
     include a list of references, definitions for abbreviations and acronyms, a glossary, and/or a descrip-
     tion of terms, that information will be placed in Attachment 1, which will be titled “Glossary of Ref-
     erences and Supporting Information”). Note: Tables of contents for electronic publications that are
     processed by AFDPO and posted on the e-Publishing website will be generated by the Central Tag-
     ging Operation (CTO) for publications that are 20 pages or more; do not submit a table of contents as
     part of the draft publication unless the publication will be printed.
        2.12.1.1. OPRs for publications that will be printed should consider adding a table of contents for
        publications over 20 pages. Include chapter titles, section titles, sub-section titles as desired, titles
        for figures or tables that appear within chapters, and attachments titles, as well as page numbers
        for all.
     2.12.2. Create your draft using Word® in 12-point Times New Roman font, with one-inch top, bot-
     tom, left, and right margins. Include page numbers on draft publications.
     2.12.3. Embed figures, tables, and illustrations where they will appear in the final version. Also pro-
     vide a separate source graphic file for each figure, table, or illustration not created in Word®. Place
     the number and title of each figure, table, illustration, etc., above the item in the publication. Limit the
     use of unnecessary color and graphics to help keep the size of transmitted and posted files down.
     Work with your publications/forms manager to ensure your graphics are submitted properly.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                     39


  2.12.4. Number all paragraphs and subparagraphs, using this publication as a visual sample for para-
  graph numbering. Do not use the automatic numbering feature in Word®—paragraphs must be man-
  ually numbered. The formatting software used by the Air Force cannot process documents that have
  been numbered automatically. Note: All paragraphs and subparagraphs should be flush left in the
  draft. The correct indentation will be applied when the publication is formatted.
     2.12.4.1. Field OPRs creating a standalone or an integrated supplement must only submit the
     material to be added to the higher headquarters publication, including the paragraph number.
     AFDPO will insert the new material into the higher headquarters publication for integrated sup-
     plements, and provide the OPR a copy of the final product.
         2.12.4.1.1. When drafting supplementary guidance, field OPRs must insert “added” between
         each new paragraph, figure, table, attachment number, etc., and the content (e.g., “4.1.1.
         (Added)”). The formatting software adds the appropriate field acronym after “(Added)”. HAF
         OPRs must insert “(Added)” and “(AF)” between each new number and the content (e.g.,
         “4.1.1. (Added)(AF)”) when supplementing a DOD publication.
         2.12.4.1.2. Do not duplicate paragraph, figure, table, or attachment numbers already in the
         basic publication when adding information in a standalone or an integrated supplement. HAF
         OPRs writing an AF supplement to a DOD issuance will start with the next number, or a
         sub-number if inserting between existing content. Field OPRs writing a supplement to a higher
         Air Force publication will repeat the number of the paragraph being supplemented and insert
         “(Added),” as specified in the previous paragraph. When the correct acronym is inserting dur-
         ing processing, the whole phrase “4.1.1. (Added)AMC)” is considered a unique identifier even
         though the numerical digits exactly match the paragraph number being supplemented. Num-
         bering must agree with the format in the basic publication; e.g., publications with chapters:
         Figure 2.1, Table 3.1, etc.; without chapters: Figure 1, Table 1, etc.
     2.12.4.2. Bullets are not authorized in Air Force publications, including interim changes. When
     updating an old publication with bulleted information, those items must be substituted with para-
     graph numbers (e.g. 2.14.1.1, 2.14.1.2., etc.).
  2.12.5. The following information must be included as part of the publication header (see the first
  page of this document as an example):
     2.12.5.1. The Seal corresponding to the Command where the publication is approved will be
     inserted during tagging—OPRs do not need to include the Seal in the draft publication. All depart-
     mental publications will display the Air Force Seal in the upper left corner of the first page, with
     “BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE” written above the Seal. All field
     publications will display the appropriate seal in the upper left corner of the first page, with “BY
     ORDER OF THE [COMMAND/BASE/WING/etc.]” written above the Seal.
     2.12.5.2. AFDPO will format the following information (both printed and electronic publica-
     tions), to be included in this order at the top of your draft, flush left, single space:
         2.12.5.2.1. BY ORDER OF THE [SECAF/command/base/wing/etc.];
         2.12.5.2.2. The publication type and number (e.g. Air Force Instruction 33-360, Air Force
         Instruction 33-360_AMC);
         2.12.5.2.3. Publications/forms managers will assign the publication date (AFDPO-PPP for
         departmental publications). The publication date is the effective date; Air Force publications
40                           AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW this Instruction. Publication
     dates assigned by AFDPO cannot exceed seven (7) business days after the publications/forms
     manager receives complete and correct materials from the OPR. With proper justification pub-
     lications at any level may be assigned an “effective” date that falls in the future, but under no
     circumstances may publications be backdated.
     2.12.5.2.4. The AFSC series title;
     2.12.5.2.5. The publication title;
     2.12.5.2.6. The compliance statement: “COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS
     MANDATORY” if a directive publication;
     2.12.5.2.7. The accessibility statement: “ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are
     available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publish-
     ing.af.mil (will convert to www.af.mil/e-publishing on AF Link).”
     2.12.5.2.8. A releasability statement, which should specify any limitations on distribution.
     Examples of releasability statements include “RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability
     restrictions on this publication”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication [or form] is
     restricted: this publication may be released to NATO members only”; “RELEASABILITY:
     Access to this publication [or form] is restricted: this publication may not be released to for-
     eign nationals”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication [or form] is restricted: this
     publication is classified/FOUO; requests for accessibility must be approved by the OPR,” etc.
     Unless there are no releasability restrictions on the publication, the statement must be prefaced
     with the phrase “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication [or form] is restricted”;
     2.12.5.2.9. “OPR: [office symbol only]”;
     2.12.5.2.10. “Certified By: [insert office symbol and, in parenthesis, the certifier’s name that
     will appear in blocks 18 and 19 of the AF Form 673]”;
     2.12.5.2.11. “Supersedes: [include the number and date of all publications being superseded,
     separated by a semicolon]”; and,
     2.12.5.2.12. “Pages: [insert page count]”.
     2.12.5.2.13. OPRs writing a GM or an AFPM should format their document like a standard
     AF memo (see AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications) and indicate in the sub-
     ject line whether it is a Policy or a Guidance Memorandum. Control numbers for GMs and
     AFPMs should be placed above the date; OPRs insert the date. If issuing new policy or guid-
     ance, include a releasability statement, applicability statement, the standard records set state-
     ment (see paragraph 2.12.7.2.) and any other applicable standard statements described in
     paragraph 2.12.7.
        2.12.5.2.13.1. If issuing an AFPM or a GM (HAF or field level) that amends an existing
        publication, insert the following standard statement as the opening statement: “This is a
        [Guidance or Policy] Memorandum immediately implementing changes to [specify the
        publication and include a short description of the policy/guidance being changed]. Com-
        pliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent
        with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI
        33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                         41


             2.12.5.2.13.2. AFPMs and all GMs (HAF and field level) will end with the following
             statement: “The directions of this memorandum become void after 180 days have elapsed
             from the date of this memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of
             the affected publication, whichever is earlier.”
         2.12.5.2.14. There are a few exceptions and additions to the above formatting requirements
         for certain publication types:
             2.12.5.2.14.1. OPRs writing supplements should refer to paragraph 2.9. for additional
             guidance on formatting supplements.
             2.12.5.2.14.2. List the publication type and number, a releasability statement (no need for
             an accessibility statement), and a supersession line on permanent VAs; this information
             should be placed at the bottom right of the VA if space allows. In some cases, placement
             of this information will be impossible due to small size of the VA; OPRs should try to
             design VAs to include this information unless doing so is impractical.
  2.12.6. Include a summary of changes when making an interim change or rewriting a publication. See
  paragraph 2.24.2. on proper formatting, content, and placement of this paragraph.
     2.12.6.1. Forewords. Only nondirective publications may have a foreword to provide a personal
     message from a proponent. Limit the foreword to one unnumbered page preceding the title (first)
     page. Publications containing forewords must include a cover. Signatures are not required on fore-
     words.
  2.12.7. Writing the Opening Paragraph. Write a concise purpose statement for all categories of publi-
  cations: explain what the publication covers, who must comply, and cite the antecedent publication(s).
  Include additional statements referencing applicability to the ANG and the Reserves—see paragraphs
  2.4. and 2.5. for guidance. Do not include policy/guidance statements in the opening paragraph. If
  implementing a DOD publication, show the type implemented after “DOD”(e.g., DOD Directive or
  DOD Instruction) and include the number and title.
  2.12.7. (USAFE) For publications below MAJCOM level, the opening paragraph does not include
  the ANG or AFRC applicability statement. This includes HQ USAFE HOI’s, because they are only
  applicable to USAFE headquarters staff.
     2.12.7.1. Legal Requirements. If applicable, note that failure to comply with the publication is
     punishable as a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Indicate if the
     publication is subject to the Privacy Act (PA) of 1974, subject to Freedom of Information Act
     (FOIA) requirements, contains copyrighted information, or is subject to other statutory require-
     ments. See Section 2C for guidance on obtaining sample statements and addressing legal issues in
     the opening paragraph of the publication. Closely coordinate opening paragraphs with your servic-
     ing legal office.
     2.12.7.2. Include the standard records management statement: “Ensure that all records created as
     a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN
     37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
     with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.”
     Additionally, if the publication generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all appli-
     cable Reports Control Numbers (RCN) in accordance with AFI 33-324.
42                                   AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


            2.12.7.2.1. Per AFI 33-324, an internal report includes data or information collected by one or
            more organizational components and transmitted to other organizational components for man-
            agement purposes. A public report includes collections of information that require responses
            from the public. See AFI 33-324 for more thorough definitions.
        2.12.7.3. Include a statement for recommending changes, including any necessary routing
        instructions. For example, “Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
        the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change
        of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
        command.”
        2.12.7.4. Include a statement in the opening paragraph if field activities must send implementing
        publications to the higher headquarters functional OPR for review and coordination before pub-
        lishing.
        2.12.7.5. Include a statement in the opening paragraph if the OPR determines that no waivers may
        be granted for any part of the publication.

2.13. Citing References. Note: See Attachment 2 for sample citation styles and formats.
     2.13.1. Limit the use of references and ensure all references are directly applicable and listed in
     Attachment 1. Do not use indefinite references such as “in current directives,” “contained in existing
     instructions,” and “as prescribed in pertinent publications.” Official Air Force policy and/or guidance
     are issued in the publications described in Table 2.1. Therefore, do not reference the following: a draft
     publication; unofficial policy and/or guidance found on websites; or classified information in an
     unclassified publication.
     2.13.2. When Executive Orders (EOs), Public Laws, or other statutes have already been implemented
     by a DOD Issuance, use the DOD Issuance as the reference citation; e.g., use “DODD 5400.7” rather
     than “Title 5 United States Code Section 552.” Note: “DOD Issuances” include Department of
     Defense Directives (DODD), DOD Instructions (DODI), other DOD publications, and their changes.
     However, when an Air Force publication directly implements a specific statute, you must cite it
     accordingly. Use codified citations (United States Code) when available, and if the provision is not
     codified, use the Public Law citation; e.g., use Public Law 98-191, or Title 41 United States Code Sec-
     tions 401-420. Verify proper statutory authority with the servicing legal office during coordination of
     the publication.
        2.13.2.1. Do not reference a DOD Issuance in an Air Force publication unless there is no Air
        Force implementing publication. If no Air Force publication, cite the DOD Issuance number and
        include the full reference (number, long title, and date) in Attachment 1.
     2.13.3. To refer to another Air Force publication and/or form, cite the designator, number, and include
     the long title in italics at first use (e.g., AFI 33-322, Records Management Program; AF Form 673, Air
     Force Publication/Form Action Request). Thereafter, refer only to the designator and number (e.g.,
     AFI 33-322 or AF Form 673). Include the full reference (number, long title, and date) in Attachment
     1.
     2.13.4. OPRs may use “notes” within a paragraph to explain or highlight information. The word
     “Note,” should be in bold followed by a colon (e.g., Note: [insert additional text]). Notes associated
     with tables, figures, or illustrations should be placed immediately below the graphic or, in the case of
     a table, in the last row.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                            43


   2.13.5. Use footnotes or endnotes to credit a lengthy legal cite, a copyright owner, the source of
   quoted materials, or provide a lengthy explanation/expansion on text within a paragraph. Endnotes
   must be placed before any attachments to the publication.
   2.13.6. (Added-USAFE) The OPR must use the Air Force e-Publishing or applicable websites to
   verify that all publications, forms, or references cited in the publication are current and valid.
   2.13.7. (Added-USAFE) Using abbreviations and acronyms. The OPR must identify any acronym or
   abbreviation the first time it is used, followed by the abbreviation or acronym in parenthesis. Do not
   show the abbreviation if the term is only used once. Once an abbreviation or acronym has been iden-
   tified, the OPR may then reference it by just using the abbreviation or acronym throughout the rest of
   the publication. All abbreviations or acronyms used more than once must be listed in Attachment 1
   under Abbreviations/Acronyms.
   2.13.8. (Added-USAFE) Exception: If you are creating a supplement and a reference, abbreviation/
   acronym or term is already listed in Attachment 1 of the basic publication, then there is no need to
   repeat it in Attachment 1 of your supplement.

2.14. Using Illustrations.
   2.14.1. Requirements of Government Printing and Binding Regulations are as follows: Use illustra-
   tions only when they relate to Air Force business and are in the public interest, relate directly to the
   subject matter, are in good taste, and are the smallest size necessary. Limit the use of color, especially
   when developing a publication that will be printed, to control the cost. Use of color on printed materi-
   als must be justified on the AF Form 673.
   2.14.2. Embed figures, tables not created in Word®, and illustrations where they will appear in the
   final version. Place the caption above the graphic. Provide a separate source graphic file for each fig-
   ure, table, or illustration not created in Word® (e.g., .tif, .gif, .jpg, etc.). Work with your publications/
   forms manager to ensure your graphics are submitted properly.

2.15. Tables. Use tables to clarify procedures, present data, and/or to explain a choice of actions or set of
conditions.
44                                           AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


Figure 2.1. Elements of a Publication.


NOTE: The following elements are authorized for use in Air Force publications.
     Division           Identification
     Volumes            Number consecutively, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Volume 1, Volume 2, etc.
     Parts              Number consecutively, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Part 1, Part 2, etc.
     Chapters           Number consecutively throughout the publication, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Chapter 1, Chapter 2,
                        etc.
     Sections           Use capital letters in alphabetical order preceded by a numeral; e.g., Section 1A, Section 1B, Section
                        2A, Section 2B, etc., throughout the publication or within each chapter.
                        If formatting publications in sections only, do not precede the section identification with a numeral. In
                        this case, then simply format as Section A, Section B, Section C, etc.
     Paragraphs         Number consecutively throughout the publication, using Arabic numerals; e.g., 1, 2, etc. For
                        publications divided into chapters, use a two-part Arabic numeral. The first numeral represents the
                        chapter, the second represents the numerical sequence of the paragraph within the chapter, e.g., 1.1, 1.2,
                        for the first chapter, 2.1, 2.2, for the second chapter, etc. If only in sections, begin with 1 and number
                        sequentially throughout the body. Do not re-sequence in the next section.
     Subparagraphs      Use Arabic numerals in sequence, separated by periods, progressing from the main paragraph number.
                        Note: These examples are for a publication in chapters.
                        1.1.1. for the first subparagraph. 1.1.1.1. for the first paragraph under the first subparagraph. 1.1.1.1.1.
                        for the first paragraph under the first sub-subparagraph, etc.
     Figures            Use:
                        Arabic numerals-Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, etc., consecutively in publications without chapters.
                        Two-part Arabic numerals in publications with chapters, the first number identifies the chapter, and the
                        second number identifies the figure sequence number within the chapter, e.g., Figure 1.1, Figure 2.1,
                        etc.; and for figures within the attachment; e.g., Figure A1.1, Figure A1.2, etc., for figures in Attachment
                        1; and Figure A2.2, etc., for figures in Attachment 2.
     Tables             Follow the procedures specified for figures.
     Attachments        Use Arabic numerals in sequence: Attachment 1, Attachment 2, Attachment 3, etc. Paragraphs in
                        attachments will take the first number from the number of the attachment; e.g., Attachment 3 would
                        have paragraph A3.1, A3.2, A3.3, etc. Note: If attachments have sections, identify them as sections
                        A1A, A1B, A1C, or A2B, A2C, etc.

     2.15.1. A standard table is data arranged in columns. The listed items are organized by some criterion
     such as alphabetical or numerical order. The format requirements for standard tables are not rigid;
     many variations are possible, depending on the kind of material you wish to place in a table. Regard-
     less of the variation used, columns and rows should be labeled (titles, numbers, letters, etc.) to facili-
     tate referencing material in the table. Tables found in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of this
     publication are examples of standard tables.
     2.15.1. (USAFE) When using Tables, only use true “MS Word” tables and not graphic files. If a table
     is inserted as a graphic file, it must be called a Figure and not a Table. When using a graphic to repre-
     sent a table, the search capability to the content of that table is removed.
     2.15.2. A decision logic table (DLT) is most useful when you need to explain a set of actions that
     depend on a condition or set of conditions; or when a narrative description of possible actions would
     be complex or wordy. There are three elements in DLTs: conditions, actions, and rules. The condi-
     tions (the ifs in the if-then relationship) are the potential circumstances that influence decisions. The
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       45


   actions (the thens in the if-then relationship) are the specific operations or tasks that must be per-
   formed when the various conditions occur. The rules are the combined conditions and actions that
   make up decisions (if + then = rule). Each separate condition and action must have its own rule. Table
   2.2. and Table 2.3. in this instruction are examples of DLTs.
   2.15.3. A specified action table (SAT) shows actions that are usually taken in a certain order but that
   do not depend on any condition. If you just want to show a series of related actions or procedures, use
   a SAT. Table 1.1. in this instruction is an example of an SAT.

2.16. Doctrine Documents. Refer to AFI 10-1301, Air and Space Doctrine, for guidance on developing
doctrine. Command activities may not issue command doctrine documents, nor may they supplement
AFDDs. The OPR for doctrine is the Air Force Doctrine Center (AFDC). Contact AFDC regarding the
format for 1- and 2-series doctrine documents. The format is similar to the joint doctrine publications.
   2.16.1. Basic doctrine (AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine) states the most fundamental and enduring
   beliefs that describe and guide the proper use of air and space power in military operations. Basic doc-
   trine is the foundation of all air and space power doctrine. Because of its fundamental and enduring
   character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance on how forces are prepared and
   employed.
   2.16.2. Operational doctrine (2 series doctrine documents) applies the principles of basic doctrine to
   operational actions by describing the proper use of air and space power in the context of distinct
   objectives, force capabilities, and operational environments. Operational doctrine describes how the
   Air Force executes its missions, and it anticipates changes and influences that may affect military
   operations, such as technological advances.
   2.16.3. Tactical doctrine (3-series tactics, techniques, and procedures [TTP] and tactics, techniques,
   and procedures [interservice] [TTP{I}]) applies basic and operational doctrine to military actions by
   describing the proper use of specific weapon systems or detailed TTPs, to accomplish specific mili-
   tary operations. TTP(I) publications are approved for use by the Air Force and at least one other Ser-
   vice. TTP(I) publication format is similar to joint doctrine publications.
       2.16.3.1. AFTTP(I)s are certified by AFDC functional area(s) (e.g. heads of functional two-letter
       offices) and are approved by the issuing organization. They require mandatory coordination as
       outlined in Section 2D. Once finalized, AFDC submits an electronic copy to AFDPO along with
       the fully coordinated and approved AF Form 673. Interservice AFTTP(I) numbers are assigned by
       AFDC, listed in the Air Force Product Index, and posted on the e-Publishing website.
       2.16.3.2. AFTTPs are Air Force-level publications subordinate to Air Force doctrine documents.
       They are certified by AFDC, require mandatory coordination as outlined in Section 2D, are listed
       in the Product Index, and posted on the e-Publishing website.
           2.16.3.2.1. AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3 series publications are approved by the MAJCOM/A3 (e.g.
           ACC/A3). The numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned by HQ ACC/A3TW (Langley
           AFB, VA) and the USAFWC/DOTW (Nellis AFB, NV).
           2.16.3.2.2. AFTTPs other than 3-1 and 3-3 series publications are approved by the issuing
           organization. Numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned with AFDC and the issuer. Once
           finalized, AFDC submits an electronic copy to AFDPO along with the fully coordinated and
           approved AF Form 673.

Section 2C—Legal Requirements

2.17. Specific Legal Requirements.
     2.17.1. Enforceability of Publications. Opening paragraphs must include, as warranted, specific
     enforceability language directing compliance by military and civilian personnel, including a descrip-
     tion of the consequences of noncompliance. A combined opening statement could read as follows:
     “This Directive sets forth policies regarding protest or political activities of Air Force civilian and mil-
     itary personnel, including the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Failure to observe prohibi-
     tions and mandatory provisions of this directive in paragraphs 1, 17, and 32 by military personnel is a
     violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Violations may result in adminis-
     trative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for viola-
     tions of related laws.”
        2.17.1.1. Nature and Purpose of Punitive Publications. A “punitive” publication is one that is
        enforceable under Article 92(1) or 92(2) of the UCMJ. Article 92 has three subsections. Article
        92(1) addresses violation of, or failure to obey, any lawful general order or regulation. Article
        92(2) addresses certain other lawful orders of which the individual accused has actual knowledge.
        Article 92(3) punishes “dereliction of duty.” The three subsections carry different maximum pun-
        ishments. Article 92(1) carries a maximum punishment of a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of
        all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years. Article 92(2) carries a maximum punishment
        of a bad conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months.
        Article 92(3) carries a maximum punishment of a bad conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and
        allowances, and confinement for 6 months, if the dereliction of duty was willful. If the dereliction
        was through neglect or culpable inefficiency, the maximum punishment is forfeiture of two-thirds
        pay per month for 3 months and confinement for 3 months. Reduction to E-1 is also possible for
        violations of any subsection of Article 92.
            2.17.1.1.1. Punitive Versus Nonpunitive Publications. Not all publications, even though law-
            ful, are “punitive;” i.e. punishable under Article 92(1) or (2). To be “punitive,” a publication
            must clearly set forth the specific conduct of individual members to be regulated, using man-
            datory language. Specific portions of publications that provide only general guidance or
            advice, or that require further supplementation by others to give them effect, will not be con-
            sidered punitive for the purpose of Article 92(1) prosecution. A nonpunitive publication, on
            the other hand, is one that provides general guidelines or advice in conducting military func-
            tions. Even though a nonpunitive publication may not be enforced under Article 92(1) or (2),
            its provisions may form the basis for a duty that can be enforced under Article 92(3) as dere-
            liction of duty. Note: The nonpunitive nature of a publication does not mean compliance
            is optional. Compliance with both punitive and nonpunitive is mandatory.
            2.17.1.1.2. General Order or Regulation. To be a “general order or regulation” for the pur-
            poses of Article 92(1), a publication must be (1) published by the President, Secretary of
            Defense, or Secretary of one of the Services, or (2) issued by an officer having general
            court-martial convening authority, a general or flag officer in command, or a commander supe-
            rior to either of those officers. A punitive publication that is not a “general order or regulation”
            (i.e. it was issued by an authority other than one of the authorities listed earlier) can be
            enforced under Article 92(2) if the individual accused had actual knowledge of its existence.

         2.17.1.1.3. Making a Publication Punitive. In some instances, the matter discussed in a publi-
         cation is of such consequence that failure to adhere to its proscriptions or mandates should
         result in punitive sanctions under Article 92, or other articles of the UCMJ. To be lawful, a
         punitive publication must be reasonable in furtherance of, or connected to, military needs (pro-
         motes morale, discipline, and usefulness of command), specific as to time and place, and def-
         inite and certain in describing the act or thing to do or omit, and not otherwise contrary to
         established law. Mandatory provisions place an affirmative duty upon an individual to do a
         certain act (e.g. lock a safe, follow a checklist, wear certain items, attend certain formations,
         etc.). Prohibitory provisions require that an individual not do something (e.g. enter a classified
         area, wear prohibited uniform combinations, drive in excess of a stated speed, etc.). Send all
         proposed punitive publications to the servicing legal office for review before issuance.
     2.17.1.2. Structure of a Punitive Publication. Generally, for a publication to be punitive, it must
     place obligations on individuals. The opening paragraph must specify which parts of the publica-
     tion contain punitive provisions; a service member should be able to tell by looking in the intro-
     duction of the publication that it contains punitive provisions. Publications containing punitive
     provisions often provide nonpunitive information. Authors must, therefore, identify clearly those
     portions that are punitive in nature, or place punitive provisions in a separate publication.
     2.17.1.3. Specifying Punitive Portions in the Opening Paragraph. The opening paragraph must
     clearly specify which parts of a publication contain mandatory provisions and prohibitions
     enforceable against the individual. While such language standing alone in the opening paragraph
     does not make a publication punitive, it becomes punitive when combined with punitive language
     in the body of the publication. The opening paragraph must state clearly to what categories of peo-
     ple the punitive provisions apply; for instance, to all service members or to all crewmembers, or to
     all persons driving automobiles on bases. The opening paragraph must say that failure to observe
     the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in the publication is a violation of Article 92 of the
     UCMJ, or that noncompliance may result in punishment under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
     2.17.1.4. Punitive Language. Most of the recommended language used in publications does not
     readily put the reader on notice that the publication is punitive in nature. Use language that
     expresses the mandatory nature of the provisions, such as “will,” “will not,” “shall,” “shall not,”
     “must,” “must not,” etc. Paragraphs containing mandatory provisions or prohibitions must state
     that a failure to obey is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. This statement should accompany
     each mandatory provision or prohibition, or may, if clear, refer to a series of mandatory provisions
     or prohibitions listed within a specific paragraph.
  2.17.2. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (DODD 8910.1, Management and Control of Information
  Requirements, and DOD 8910.1-M, DOD Procedures for Management of Information Requirements).
  Each Air Force publication that authorizes collecting information internal or external to the Air Force
  is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Note: Follow guidance provided in AFI 33-324.
  The Air Force must license collections with the proper reports control symbol (RCS). This includes
  information collection requirements in support of management functions, unless excluded in AFI
  33-324; information collected to satisfy statutory, congressional, and other interagency-imposed
  information requirements; the collection of information from the public; and information collected
  internally within the Air Force.
  2.17.3. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (DOD 5400.7-R, DOD Freedom of Information Act Pro-
  gram). Federal statute, DOD and Air Force policy requires prompt and accurate disclosure of informa-
48                                   AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     tion to the public. Air Force publications must be reviewed by a FOIA specialist prior to publication
     to ensure compliance with FOIA requirements. Refer to DODR 5400.7_AFSUP1, DOD Freedom of
     Information Act Program, for additional guidance and procedures.
     2.17.4. Privacy Act (PA) of 1974 (DODD 5400.11, DOD Privacy Program). Each Air Force publica-
     tion will contain a PA warning statement if it provides for or requires the Air Force to collect or main-
     tain personal information in a PA system of records that is retrieved by personal identifier. Follow AFI
     33-332, Privacy Act Program, for further privacy act guidance and sample privacy act statements. Pri-
     vacy Act System Notices are available online at: http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.
     2.17.5. Federal Register (DOD 5025.1-M). The Air Force must notify the public of publications that
     affect the public, or will require public compliance. Make notification in the Federal Register as pre-
     scribed by AFI 33-320, Federal Register.
     2.17.6. Copyrighted material (AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property: Patents, Patent Related Matters,
     Trademarks and Copyrights). Do not use copyrighted information in Air Force publications without
     obtaining permission from the copyright holder. The only exception is use of very short passages of
     copyrighted works; check with your servicing legal office to determine if your intended use falls
     within this exception. Note: Permission for use must cite any restrictions on releasability. See para-
     graph 2.12. for instructions on formatting and Section 2E for instructions on processing publications
     with and without restricted releasability.
        2.17.6.1. To show the presence of copyrighted material in a draft, indicate on the AF Form 673
        (“Additional Information” block) that the draft contains copyrighted material.
        2.17.6.2. At the bottom of the title page, centered below all other information, place the following
        statement in bold capital letters: THIS PUBLICATION CONTAINS COPYRIGHTED
        MATERIAL.
        2.17.6.3. Footnote copyrighted information in the text and cite the author of the work, the title, the
        publisher, and the year of publication. This applies regardless of whether permission from the
        copyright holder is required.
     2.17.7. Trade Names and Trademarks. When using a trade name or mark of a non-Federal/govern-
     ment entity, include the following disclaimer as the last sentence in the publication’s opening para-
     graph: “The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity,
     or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.” A trade name is simply
     the name of the commercial enterprise, such as the Microsoft® Company. Check the company’s web-
     site to determine if the name requires a “Registered” symbol (®). Distinguish each use of a trademark
     by inserting a trademark symbol (™) after the mark. See AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property: Patents,
     Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights, for further guidance.
     2.17.8. Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Because official unclassified AF pub-
     lications are available on the e-Publishing website, publications at any level must be Section 508 com-
     pliant, in accordance with AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use. AFDPO is responsible for
     ensuring all publications posted on the e-Publishing website are Section 508 compliant.

Section 2D—Coordination

2.18. Coordination. A completed AF Form 673 must accompany the draft submitted for publication,
although OPRs may obtain coordination using email, an AF IMT 1768 (SSS), or the AF Form 673 (elec-
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                            49


tronic or pen-and-ink signatures are acceptable) on draft publications. If signatures are obtained simulta-
neously (i.e., “shotgunned”), transcribe the information onto the AF Form 673 and maintain original
correspondence with signatures in the record set (see Section 2I for additional information on record
sets). Functional coordination should be completed and recommended changes accomplished in the draft
before the final version is submitted for mandatory coordination. The OPR cannot release any final drafts
for publication with unresolved nonconcurrences or insufficient coordination. Note: Only civilian
employees (including direct-hire foreign national employees, but not contractors or indirect-hire foreign
national employees) and military members may provide coordination on publications and forms at any
level.
   2.18.1. Coordination Requirements.
   2.18.1. (USAFE) The OPR must state in their request for coordination, whether they seek functional/
   technical or mandatory coordination. Furthermore it must be clearly stated whether this coordination
   is for a publication or jointly for a publication and a new/revised form. If it is a joint coordination, then
   a draft of the proposed form must be included in the package routed for coordination. If this fact is not
   clearly stated, the provided proof of coordination will be considered for a publication only.
       2.18.1.1. Technical/Functional-Level Reviews. Obtain technical/functional comments from those
       offices with relevant expertise. Resolve all issues of nonconcurrence. If necessary, elevate issues
       to the next higher authority for resolution. All publishing actions except administrative changes
       (ACs) and responses to two-year or special reviews require technical/functional coordination. See
       Table 2.3. for technical/functional coordination rules. See paragraph 1.2.8. for technical/func-
       tional coordinator responsibilities. Note: if the OPR neglects to obtain technical/functional coor-
       dination from an affected office the OPR may be required to do an immediate update if language
       in the publication is contested by an office that was not given the opportunity to coordinate. If res-
       olution cannot be reached at the OPR level, the OPR must grant a waiver to the affected office
       absolving them from complying with the contested language until the issue is resolved. The OPR
       will involve the servicing legal office and elevate within the chain of command as necessary to
       resolve contested guidance. If the contested language is dictated in a DOD publication, the OPR
       will need to work with the DOD OPR to obtain a waiver or change the DOD guidance; send a
       courtesy copy of all email correspondences between the Air Force OPR and the DOD OPR to the
       SAF/AAX workflow box (safaax.workflow@pentagon.af.mil).
       2.18.1.2. Mandatory Coordination Requirements for Publications. Only new publications and
       fully revised publications require mandatory coordination in addition to technical/functional coor-
       dination. Exception: Mandatory coordination is required for all actions taken on AFPDs and AF
       supplements to DODDs (except the approval of ACs). See Table 2.2. for mandatory coordination
       rules. See paragraph 1.2.8. for mandatory coordinator responsibilities.
       2.18.1.3. Supplements to DODDs carry the same weight as AFPDs, and are subject to the same
       requirements; the SECAF will always be the authenticator on AFPDs and AF supplements to
       DODDs. Direct supplements to DODIs carry the same weight as AFIs and direct supplements to
       DODRs and DODMs carry the same weight as AFMANs—all must be coordinated accordingly.
       2.18.1.4. In addition to certification and approval, AFPMs require technical/functional coordina-
       tion, coordination with SAF/AAX and a legal review by SAF/GCA; GMs only require technical/
       functional coordination, in order to expedite processing. Certifying and approval authorities at the
       HAF for AFPMs and GMs are the same as for AFPDs and AFIs, respectively. Note: Those
50                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


        AFPMs and GMs that require immediate release because they address critical issues only require
        a legal review and the approval authority’s signature (the SECAF for AFPMs) on the AF Form
        673. OPRs submitting a PM or GM under these circumstances must provide full justification on
        the AF Form 673.
        2.18.1.5. Unless otherwise specified in unit-level guidance, HOIs and OIs follow coordination
        requirements for directive publications. Requirements for HOIs generated by the Air Staff or the
        Secretariat (the HAF) are established in HOI 33-13, Headquarters Air Force Operating Instruc-
        tions, Pamphlets, and Handbooks Management Program, which is maintained by HAF/IC.
     2.18.2. Preparing the AF Form 673. Note: when an OPR submits an AF Form 673 to accomplish a
     publishing action (new, change, cancellation), block 1 should contain the publishing manager’s office
     (e.g., AFDPO for HAF OPRs); when the publishing office is initiating a two-year or a special review
     on publications and forms, block 1 should contain the OPR’s contact name and office symbol. OPRs
     only complete section 3 during a two-year or special review.
        2.18.2.1. A “fillable” electronic version of this form is available on the e-Publishing website.
        Complete the AF Form 673 in its entirety, including special information in block 32, if necessary.
            2.18.2.1.1. Indicate in block 32 if the draft contains copyrighted material. Indicate in block 9
            if the draft contains For Official Use Only (FOUO) material.
            2.18.2.1.2. To avoid the issuance of unfunded mandates, indicate in block 32 if the publica-
            tion drives the need for additional or different manpower, funding, contract terms, etc. Include
            dollar amounts or man-hours when possible; if no dollar amounts or man-hours have been
            specified be sure to include summary statements alerting coordinators of the areas in the draft
            that may have resource implications.
        2.18.2.2. Block 10 (“Purpose”): Note that no more than five (5) ICs may be made to a publication,
        and no single IC may alter more than 20 percent of the content (see paragraph 2.25.).
        2.18.2.3. Blocks 11, 12a, and 12b are designed to capture form-related information; completion
        of these blocks is necessary if you have created a form and prescribed its use in a publication, or if
        you adopt the use of an existing form in a publication. Block 15 is designed to capture information
        about temporary and permanent visual aids. While it is not necessary to explicitly prescribe a per-
        manent visual aid in a publication, it is necessary to associate a permanent visual aid with the pub-
        lication that provides justification/reason for its creation. Block 13 (“Special Printing”) gives
        OPRs who have created a publication or form that requires printing (such as a bound manual,
        pamphlets for display, etc.) a standard place to alert publication/form managers and provide their
        unique specifications.
        2.18.2.4. If your publication and/or form has releasability restrictions, copy the releasability state-
        ment from the front matter of the publication (or the footer of the form) and paste into block 14.
        Doing so will alert the publications/forms manager that your publication/form may not be posted
        to a publicly-accessible website and ensure proper distribution of your publication/form.
        2.18.2.5. All coordinations must be obtained before the certifying and approval authorities manu-
        ally or digitally sign the AF Form 673. Coordinators may also sign the AF Form 673 manually or
        digitally. Note: Applying digital signatures in the certifier and approval authority blocks “lock” all
        preceding information; once the certifying or approval authority has digitally signed the AF Form
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       51


     673, no changes can be made to any preceding information without removing one (or both) of the
     signatures.
     2.18.2.6. Obtain the certifying official’s signature. The certifying official is a minimum of one
     organizational level above the OPR and certifies the need for the publication, to include currency
     of information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content. The certifier referenced in
     the publication must sign block 19.
     2.18.2.6. (USAFE) If the certifying official’s signature is obtained digitally, then for verification
     purposes, the electronic copy of the signed AF Form 673 must be included in the publications
     package forwarded to the Publications Manager for release processing.
        2.18.2.6.1. Departmental publications authored by a MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or other field
        unit must be certified and approved by a two-letter organization at the HAF.
        2.18.2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) MAJCOM level publications authored below the headquarters
        level must be certified at the MAJCOM level.
     2.18.2.7. Obtain the approving official’s signature. Approving officials are senior leaders respon-
     sible for policies and guidance/procedures pertaining to their functional areas (e.g. heads of
     two-letter functional offices). Unless the authority is delegated, the authenticator referenced on the
     last page of the publication must sign block 22.
     2.18.2.7. (USAFE) If the approval official’s signature is obtained digitally, then for verification
     purposes, the electronic copy of the signed AF Form 673 must be included in the publications
     package forwarded to the Publications Manager for release processing.
        2.18.2.7.1. The SECAF is the only authenticator and approving official for AFPDs, PMs, and
        AF supplements to DODDs.
        2.18.2.7.2. (Added-USAFE) MAJCOM level publications authored below the headquarters
        level must be approved at the MAJCOM level.
     2.18.2.8. Represent all functional and mandatory coordination in Section II. If you use other
     means to collect coordination, type in the required information on the master AF Form 673, and
     keep the individually signed email, AF Form 673, or AF IMT 1768 (SSS) for your record set.
     HAF OPRs must send a fully coordinated and signed AF Form 673 along with each publication
     for processing to AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil. Note: Field OPRs must send a fully coordi-
     nated and signed AF Form 673 along with each publication for processing to the publications/
     forms management office. Field publishing managers are not required to submit the accompany-
     ing AF Form 673 to AFDPO, unless the publication is departmental.
        2.18.2.8.1. (Added-USAFE) If the coordinator electronically signed the AF Form 673, then
        the electronic copy of the AF Form 673 must be included in the package forwarded for publi-
        cation. If the coordinator replied via email, a copy (paper or electronic) of the email is suffi-
        cient.
        2.18.2.8.2. (Added-USAFE) If other means to collect coordination was used, the OPR must
        still type in the required information on the master AF Form 673. Copies (paper or electronic)
        of all correspondence showing coordination (AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheets, emails,
        memos etc.), must be included in the publications package for release.
52                                AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     2.18.2.9. OPRs should allow at least two weeks for offices to provide coordination. If the publica-
     tion is particularly large or complicated, allow additional time.
         2.18.2.9.1. If coordinating offices are unable to meet a suspense date, requests for extensions
         must be submitted to the OPR.
     2.18.2.10. In providing concurrence, coordinators agree to the contents within a publication or
     form from a functional perspective. Additionally, coordinators are agreeing to the releasability of
     the publication, as stated by the OPR in the publication. If the contents or purpose of a publication
     or a form are in conflict with existing policy or guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the pub-
     lication is not in keeping with guidance in AFI 31-401, coordinators must provide feedback to the
     OPR accordingly.
     2.18.2.11. When providing feedback, coordinators should specify one of the following levels for
     each comment provided in a standard comment matrix. Coordinators should use the matrix pro-
     vided by the OPR; if none is provided, generate a new matrix. Include columns for the following
     elements in the comment matrix: organization, item number, type of comment (Administrative,
     Substantive, or Critical—include a legend at the bottom of the matrix), page number, paragraph
     number, line number, comment, and rationale. Regardless of the level of comment, coordinators
     must designate a POC to work with the OPR towards resolution. The POC designated by the
     reviewer may not be a contractor or an indirect-hire foreign national.
     2.18.2.11. (USAFE) If the coordination resulted in non-concurrence or comments, the coordina-
     tor is required to use the USAFE standard coordination matrix. The rationale must be a concise,
     objective explanation of the reason for the comment. The Publication Coordination Matrix must
     be used instead of the old method annotating comments directly onto the manuscript. Coordinat-
     ing offices must group their comments as shown on the following sample Publication Coordina-
     tion Matrix. The OPR is required to include a printed or electronic copy of the Matrix in the
     package forwarded for publication. This serves as proof that the OPR has solved all non-concur-

        cannot be processed and posted on the e-Publishing Web Page.
        2.18.2.11.4. (Added-USAFE) The OPR must solve all of these comments and document the
        solution on the Publication Coordination Matrix in the “OPR Decision” column.
     2.18.2.12. OPRs must resolve all critical comments before submitting the publication or form for
     final processing and publishing. Ensure that any critical comments submitted to the OPR are clear
     and that a POC within the coordinating office is designated so the OPR may follow-up. OPRs will
     work directly with the POC to resolve any issues. Resolution of comments must be included in the
     record set for the publication/form.
     2.18.2.13. If the AF Form 673 or the AF IMT 1768 (SSS) contains coordination more than one
     year old and no significant changes to the draft contents have been made, OPRs must state in
     block 32 of the AF Form 673 that no recoordination is necessary before the certifying and
     approval officials sign the form. If significant changes have been made the OPR is responsible for
     reaccomplishing necessary coordination.

NOTES:
1. Contact coordinating offices for instructions on routing sensitive and classified publications.
2. All publications going to the SECAF for signature must be routed through the Command section at
   the HAF. Refer to HOI 33-3, Information Workflow Management and Correspondence Preparation,
   for guidance on submitting packages for SECAF signature.
3. See paragraph 2.18.1.5. for coordination requirements for HOIs and OIs. OPRs for HAF HOIs and
   OIs must refer to HOI 33-13 for guidance and procedures.
4. Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter organizations, unless otherwise directed in the
   coordination tables. Two-letters are responsible for ensuring the correct offices within the orga-
   nization review and coordinate on the publication and/or form and for providing a consoli-
   dated response. The consolidated response does not necessarily have to carry a two-letter level
   signature; the two-letter may designate a lower-level office within the organization to provide
   the response and sign off on the coordination form provided.

NOTES:
1.    Contact coordinating offices for instructions on routing sensitive and classified publications.
2.    Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter organizations, unless otherwise directed in the coordination
      tables. Two-letters are responsible for ensuring the correct offices within the organization review and coordinate
      on the publication and/or form and for providing a consolidated response. The consolidated response does not
      necessarily have to carry a two-letter level signature; the two-letter may designate a lower-level office within the
      organization to provide the response and sign off on the coordination form provided.

Section 2E—Publishing Finalized Publications

2.20. Posting on the e-Publishing Website.
     2.20.1. With the exception of ANG wings/subunits, OPRs submit all publications for release on the
     e-Publishing website to the local publications/forms manager. The publishing manager for depart-
     mental publications is AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil); the publishing manager for HOIs,
     HPAMs, and HAF Handbooks generated at the HAF (Secretariat or Air Staff) is HAF/IM
     (hafim.workflow@pentagon.af.mil).
     2.20.1. (USAFE) The publications manager for USAFE is USAFE CSS/SCXM.
          2.20.1.1. Field publications/forms managers submitting directly to AFDPO will submit files for
          tagging via file transfer protocol (FTP) site. Field files should not be sent via e-mail, although field
          publications/forms managers should send notification of the submission to the AFDPO-CTO
          organizational e-mail address. If you lack access to the FTP site, please contact AFDPO for a login
          and password at AFDPO-CTO@pentagon.af.mil. ANG field publications will be submitted to
          the local wing publications/forms managers, and are not sent to AFDPO for tagging.
     2.20.2. After the publication is tagged it will be posted to the website. AFDPO will notify the publi-
     cations/forms manager via e-mail or fax when publications are posted to the e-Publishing website.
     AFDPO posts products to the e-Publishing website 5-7 business days after receiving the complete
     submission from the OPR. If AFDPO requires additional time the OPR will be notified. Note: OPRs
     are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and
     posted on the e-Publishing website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that
     related publications and/or processes may be affected.
          2.20.2.1. AFPMs and GMs (HAF and field level) will be posted to the e-Publishing website under
          the appropriate subject series. If an AFPM or a GM (HAF or field level) amends an existing pub-
          lication, AFDPO will post an announcement directing users to reference those AFPMs/GMs
          amending the publication “on top” of the publication, so that publication users will view the
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                        63


       announcement, including a list of all current AFPMs or GMs amending the publication, when they
       click to access the document. A link to the publication will be included at the bottom of the
       announcement.
   2.20.3. A subscription-based electronic notification system is available on the e-Publishing website.
   This service will notify subscribers of all new, revised, changed, or rescinded products posted to the
   e-Publishing website.
   2.20.4. Because a restricted/classified departmental publishing site is not yet available, field publish-
   ing activities may post electronic classified and FOUO publications on the local headquarters SIPR-
   NET site. All classified and FOUO publications posted on a headquarters SIPRNET site must be
   listed under an unclassified title in the Product Index on the e-Publishing website.
       2.20.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Classified publications must also adhere to the policies and guid-
       ance of AFI 33-360 and this supplement, regardless of the classification level.
          2.20.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The OPR must contact the publishing office and obtain a “Con-
          trol Number” for the publication.
          2.20.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The OPR must provide the publishing office a completed and
          fully coordinated AF Form 673. Do not include a copy of the actual classified publication
          (electronic or hard copy) or any comments provided during the coordination process. If neces-
          sary the OPR must also provide an unclassified title for the classified publication, for inclusion
          in the e-Publishing Master Catalog (see paragraph 1.2.5.4.).
              2.20.4.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The OPR of the originating office must coordinate the
              classified draft through appropriate secure means. It is the OPR’s responsibility to take the
              necessary steps to maintain the integrity of the classified information (see Table 2.3.
              (Added) Notes), while following the same basic coordination procedures as indicated for
              unclassified drafts.
                  2.20.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If a mandatory coordinating office does not have the
                  properly cleared staff to conduct the coordination, then the OPR must include the cor-
                  respondence from the coordinating office stating this fact, in the publications package.
          2.20.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate releasability statement must be indicated on AF
          Form 673. Until Air Force establishes a “Restricted/Classified” site, the distribution for all
          classified publications is currently still the responsibility of the OPR.
          2.20.4.1.4. (Added-USAFE) It is the OPR’s responsibility to maintain the official master
          record set for classified publications, on which their office holds ownership.
   2.20.5. If a departmental publication or form is classified, FOUO, or the publication is a visual aid
   designed for display, it will be scheduled for printing rather than posted to the e-Publishing website.
   Discuss production alternatives with the publications/forms manager (AFDPO) if a printed product is
   not ideal.

2.21. Processing Products for Printing.
   2.21.1. The OPR will submit a completed Government Printing Office (GPO) Form 952, Desktop
   Publishing Disk Information; AF Form 673; a clean printout; disk; and any additional artwork to the
64                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     local publications manager. Ask your publications/forms manager for help with filling out forms and/
     or identifying graphics requirements, if necessary.
     2.21.2. Printing in two or more colors generally increases costs. All publications/forms managers
     must ensure that multicolor printing projects are necessary, that minimum color printing is used, and
     that the extra cost is justified. Note: Avoid using excessive printing requirements (e.g. coated paper,
     embossing, die-cutting, foil stamping, etc.). The OPR must justify use of multicolor printing and/or
     additional printing requirements in block 38 of the AF Form 673.
     2.21.3. If the OPR deems it is necessary, unrestricted physical products may be sold publicly. The
     OPR must complete GPO Form 3868, Notification of Intent to Publish, and provide to the local publi-
     cations manager, who will process it through AFDPO/PPL. Sales to the public will be handled by the
     Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Services (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road,
     Springfield, VA 22161-0001.
     2.21.4. Physical products may be ordered from the e-Publishing website, or directly from the local
     Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS) office. Contact your publications manager for bulk
     printing of electronic products. Note: Funding for printing publishing products may be centralized
     within your local publishing function.
        2.21.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Funding for printing of publishing products is not centralized at
        USAFE. The OPR is responsible to bear all costs associated with the printing for any physical
        products resulting from the processes prescribed in the policy, unless the policy clearly places this
        responsibility on the end user.
     2.21.5. OPRs will receive a copy of the printed publication or form, which will serve as notice that
     the publishing process is complete. The OPR may request additional copies for OPR-driven dissemi-
     nation on the AF Form 673 in block 38. The OPR may also furnish a list of intended recipients on the
     AF Form 673 for AFDPO-driven dissemination. Any additional distribution restrictions should be
     included in block 38 of the AF Form 673.

Section 2F—Updating Publications

2.22. Suggesting Updates to Publications. Any Air Force member or employee may report errors, sug-
gest revisions, and recommend corrective action by submitting an AF Form 847 to the OPR, or through
the appropriate functional’s chain of command for higher headquarters publications. AF Form 847 is pre-
scribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Refer to that publication for guidance on
filling out the form.
     2.22.1. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the activity
     noting the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs highlighting the conflict and
     requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working with each other to deconflict and issue the
     correct publication(s).
     2.22.2. If a field activity notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters publications, submit an
     AF IMT 847 to both OPRs, following the chain of command as appropriate. AF IMT 847s submitted
     for HAF publications must be sent through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.
     2.22.3. Certifying the Currency of Publications. Publications/forms managers Air Force-wide will
     initiate a review every two years of publications and any forms prescribed therein in the anniversary
     month of the publication date, using an AF Form 673. AFDPO will initiate the review of all depart-
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                        65


  mental publications, even those departmental publications that are authored in the field (record sets
  for departmental publications authored in the field will be kept in accordance with the Air Force
  Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) and the field publications/forms manager’s instruction). If the
  OPR has given publication status on an AF Form 673 within the past year, postpone the review until
  the next cycle. Note: Both the OPR and the certifying official identified in the publication must sign
  the AF Form 673 during the two-year or a special review; when certifying a publication as current or
  providing status outside a review cycle, the OPR and the certifying official must sign the 673. No
  additional coordination is required if only providing status; additional coordination may be required if
  providing status and also requesting action on a publication/form.
  2.22.3. (USAFE) Publication Managers will initiate a review for their publications annually on the
  anniversary month of the original publication date, using the AF Form 673. If the OPR has provided
  the publications status on AF Form 673 within the past year, file the response in the record set and
  postpone the review until the next cycle.
     2.22.3.1. If the OPR determines there are no changes to the publication the OPR must indicate
     this on the AF Form 673 and submit it to the publications/forms manager (see also paragraphs
     2.8.5. and 2.24.1. to ensure no changes are necessary). OPRs for departmental publications submit
     the completed AF Form 673 directly to AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil; field publications man-
     agers may send relevant information to AFDPO via email at AFDPO-CTO@pentagon.af.mil (it
     is not necessary to include the field OPR’s AF Form 673). AFDPO will add “Certified current
     [add date the AF Form 673 is received]” under the publication date and post on the e-Publishing
     website. For ANG publications, NGB-DMJ-P will add “Certified Current [add date the AF Form
     673 is received] under the publication date for ANG FOA-level publications and post to the NGB
     publishing site (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm).
     2.22.3.2. If changes must be made, the OPR must submit an AC, IC, or a rewrite within 180 days
     of the date listed on the AF Form 673. See paragraphs 2.25.-2.27. for guidance on submitting
     changes or rewriting a publication.
     2.22.3.3. If a publication is obsolete, required coordination, certification, and approval must be
     completed before the OPR returns the AF Form 673 to the publications/forms management office.
     Note: the SECAF must approve the cancellation of any AFPD or AF supplement to a DODD; this
     authority may not be delegated.
     2.22.3.4. If a departmental publication or form is classified, FOUO, or the publication is a perma-
     nent visual aid designed for display, it will be scheduled for printing rather than posted to the
     e-Publishing website. Discuss production alternatives with the publications/forms manager if a
     printed product is not ideal. OPRs may request limited reprints of printed products during the
     two-year review. Request a limited reprint if inventory is low for an essential publication or form
     that requires revision. Note on the AF Form 673 how many months you will need to complete the
     revision so the appropriate amount of inventory may be ordered.
  2.22.4. Transfer of Responsibility for a Publication. When a functional OPR transfers responsibil-
  ity for a publication to a different organization, the transferring official must notify the publications/
  forms manager (send a copy to SAF/AAX for transfers of departmental publications that implement a
  DOD Issuance) using an AF Form 673. The two-letter functional principal of the losing activity is the
  certifying authority. The functional principal of the gaining authority is the approval official. The
  OPR for the losing activity must obtain technical/functional coordination on the AF Form 673; con-
66                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     tact information for the new OPR goes in block 32 of the AF Form 673. Note: If transferring respon-
     sibility for an AFPD or AF supplement to a DODD, the SECAF must serve as the approving authority.
     2.22.4. (USAFE) Follow the procedures prescribed in the basic publication, however the notification
     is forwarded to the Publications Manager at the appropriate level.
        2.22.4.1. If transferring numerous publications and/or forms at one time, a memo listing all the
        publications marked for transfer (number, title, and date) signed by the functional principal of the
        gaining activity indicating acceptance will suffice. The memo should be addressed to the func-
        tional principal of the losing activity. Send a courtesy copy to publications/forms manager
        (AFDPO for departmental publications and, if the publications directly implement DOD Issu-
        ances, a copy to SAF/AAX). A copy of the memo must be included in the record set for each
        affected publication.
        2.22.4.2. Gaining OPRs of transferred publications must alert OPRs of supplements of the trans-
        fer. Transferred publications are often assigned new numbers and otherwise updated, and OPRs
        for subordinate publications will need to update their publications accordingly.
        2.22.4.3. In addition to carrying out all reorganization/realignment responsibilities described in
        AFI 10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans (PPLAN), gaining OPRs
        for transferred publications will need to accomplish an IC to change the control number (if trans-
        ferring to a different subject series), certifying and approving official information, and any other
        affected content. The record set for the publication being transferred must also be moved to the
        gaining OPR; accommodations for this action must be written into transfer agreements (PAD,
        PGL, etc.).

2.23. Requesting a Waiver. When complying with a higher headquarters publication adversely affects
your mission due to a unique situation, you may request a waiver from the OPR; send a request via e-mail
or memorandum, explaining the need for the waiver. If deemed necessary by the OPR, the waiver request
may be elevated within the organization for review and approval. If the waiver is granted, the OPR of the
publication must file it with the record set and provide a copy of the waiver to the publications/forms
manager (AFDPO is the manager for HAF OPRs) when submitting the draft for publication. Field publi-
cations/forms managers must include a copy of each related waiver when submitting products to AFDPO.
A waiver remains in effect until the OPR cancels it in writing, the publication is completely rewritten, or
the waiver expires (the expiration date must be specified in the documentation granting the waiver).
Include a statement in the opening paragraph if no waivers are authorized for that particular publication or
if no waivers are authorized for certain portions of the publication.
     2.23.1. In some cases, the waiver may last the life of the basic publication. If so, the organization
     requesting a waiver may need to create a supplement to implement the waiver. The OPR of the basic
     publication will work with the organization requesting a waiver to design appropriate guidance if a
     supplement is necessary. State in the opening paragraph if the supplement has been created to imple-
     ment a waiver.

2.24. Revising a Publication. Making an IC, an administrative change (AC), and issuing a rewrite are
the only authorized methods of changing an official Air Force publication. A publication requires a
rewrite when major content is affected by a change in Air Force mission, organization, DOD mandate, or
five interim changes (ICs) have been issued. All authorized changes will be incorporated into the publica-
tion and posted on the e-Publishing website. Note: OPRs of publications that have been printed usually
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       67


must issue rewrites, because making page changes is often cost-prohibitive. Check with your publica-
tions/forms manager to discuss possible alternatives if a change is necessary.
   2.24.1. When a higher headquarters publication is updated (either by an interim change or a rewrite),
   implementing publications (such as supplements) must be rewritten, updated using an IC, or, if appli-
   cable, certified as current within 180 days. Publications/forms managers may use the AF Form 399 to
   alert OPRs of changes to higher headquarters publications. Publications/forms managers will fill out
   the top half of the form, using the “special instructions” block to tell the OPR how to access the pub-
   lication and to note the type of action taken on the higher headquarters publication (e.g., revised,
   rescinded, amended using a GM, etc.). OPRs will fill out the bottom half in response. An AF Form
   673 must accompany any final requests for action by the OPR.
   2.24.1. (USAFE) OPR’s with supplements to higher headquarters publications are responsible for
   reviewing the Air Force e-Publishing web site and Product Announcements for notifications when
   higher headquarters publications are updated, to ensure their supplements are current, or updated
   within 180 days.
       2.24.1.1. Only those implementing publications that do not require any content changes after the
       higher headquarters publication is changed may be certified as current. OPRs will follow the same
       procedures for certifying supplementary guidance as current whether the supplement is in standa-
       lone or integrated format on the e-Publishing website (standalone versions only include supple-
       mentary material whereas integrated versions insert supplementary material into the higher
       headquarters publication). Procedures for certifying a publication as current may be found in para-
       graph 2.22.3. Note: If the implementing publication conflicts with the higher headquarters publi-
       cation, the implementing publication must immediately be rescinded and removed from the
       website. OPRs may issue a GM to replace the conflicting publication, or add new guidance to
       non-conflicting implementing publications while the publication is under revision.
       2.24.1.2. GMs used to replace or amend implementing publications will expire when the supple-
       ment is revised (must be within 180 days). Expired GMs (those exceeding 180 days) and imple-
       menting publications that have not been updated within 180 days will be removed from the
       e-Publishing website and the publications manager will be notified. See paragraphs under 2.10.4.
       and 2.12.5. for guidance on formatting a GM. Note: “Policy letters,” guides, and bulletins are not
       recognized as part of the publishing program; any guidance or information issued in a policy letter,
       guide, or bulletin requiring implementation/compliance must be established in a publication type
       described in this instruction and processed accordingly.
   2.24.2. Summary of Changes. A summary of changes is mandatory for all ICs and rewritten publica-
   tions. The summary of changes cites major changes: content changes; new, revised, or obsolete forms;
   new, revised, or rescinded recurring reports; etc. Place the summary of changes immediately after the
   opening paragraph. Include this statement as the last sentence when making an IC (not when issuing a
   rewrite): “A margin bar indicates newly revised material.” Note: Do not include a summary of
   changes for new publications.
       2.24.2.1. ACs do not require a summary of changes.

2.25. Interim Changes (IC).
   2.25.1. Changes to mission-essential information (e.g., law, DOD mandate, Air Force policy or guid-
   ance, etc.) and/or a major reorganization are examples of events that may necessitate substantive
68                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     changes to an existing publication, although OPRs may use ICs to change any type of information in
     the publication. OPRs may issue only five (5) ICs to Air Force publications, none of which should
     change more than 20 percent of the paragraphs in the publication (tables, figures, and illustrations
     count as paragraphs). After the fifth IC, the publication must be rewritten, which requires mandatory
     and technical/functional coordination (reference Section 2E).
        2.25.1.1. ICs will not change the basic date of the publication. AFDPO will insert a line under the
        basic date stating, for example, "Incorporating Change 1, [insert date IC posted]" or "Incorporat-
        ing Through Change 3, [insert date third IC posted].”
        2.25.1.2. After the fifth IC, OPRs should begin preparing a full rewrite to allow for expeditious
        coordination when the next change comes in.
        2.25.1.3. Protect FOUO or classified ICs as directed in AFI 31-401.
     2.25.2. Interim Change Processing.
        2.25.2.1. The publications/forms manager assigns a number to each change. ICs are numbered
        cumulatively, and may not exceed 5 (IC-1, IC-2, IC-3, IC-4, IC-5). ICs may be spread out over a
        number of years; the assigned number should be cumulative, regardless of the year in which the IC
        is being accomplished.
        2.25.2.2. Submit the IC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font. The publications/
        forms manager assigns the date of the IC. The date of the IC is the effective date; ICs are not con-
        sidered effective until they are released to users IAW this Instruction. The publications/forms
        manager for HAF OPRs is AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil). IC dates assigned by
        AFDPO cannot exceed seven (7) business days after they receive complete and correct materials
        from the OPR. With proper justification interim changes at any level may be assigned an “effec-
        tive” date that falls in the future, but under no circumstances may interim changes be backdated.
        2.25.2.3. Changes will be made in complete paragraphs, (i.e., submit the entire paragraph 3 to
        replace the existing paragraph 3, even if only one word or one sentence changed). Each changed
        paragraph, table, figure, etc., must be preceded by an asterisk (*), which will trigger placement of
        the margin bar when the publication is formatted. A change must not renumber existing content;
        add new paragraphs or sub-paragraphs (or figures, chapters, etc.) as needed to insert additional
        material without renumbering the existing content. Changed material will be identified with a
        margin bar in the basic publication.
            2.25.2.3.1. A deleted paragraph should cite the paragraph number and the word DELETED,
            (e.g., “3.77. DELETED”). Note: references to deleted content must be removed and the docu-
            ment re-numbered during a rewrite.
            2.25.2.3.2. Figures, Tables, and Attachments. Completely delete or provide a completely new
            figure, table, or attachment to replace the current figure, table, or attachment. Figures, tables,
            and attachments can be added as long as there is a reference to them in a paragraph.
        2.25.2.4. OPRs must obtain technical/functional coordination on the proposed changes, using the
        AF Form 673, before obtaining the certifying and approving officials’ signatures (if issuing an IC
        to an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DODD, only the SECAF may approve/sign). Mandatory
        coordination is not required to publish an IC. Send the IC along with the properly signed and dated
        AF Form 673 to the publications/forms manager for processing (AFDPO-PPP for HAF publica-
        tions). If the signatures are correct, the IC will be processed and posted to the e-Publishing website
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                           69


       within seven business days of submission. OPRs may request faster processing of the IC on the
       AF Form 673; AFDPO will review and respond directly to requests for faster processing.
       2.25.2.5. After the IC is posted to the e-Publishing website, AFDPO will notify the OPR or the
       publications/forms manager. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a publica-
       tion is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing website. The OPR notice
       should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be
       affected.

Figure 2.2. Sample Interim Change.


IC-1 TO AFI 10-248, Fitness Program
24 July 2007
*SUMMARY OF CHANGES


This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify requirements for the unit-based fitness
program, corrects the time period for testing following deployment, identifies the fitness software
application by name, places a timeline on data entry, specifies requirement for Health and Wellness staff
to conduct body fat measurements on accessions, provides minimum period for retest requirements,
defines exemption parameters and processes, eliminates required sequence for push-ups and crunches,
provides guidance for the assessment of shift workers and intervention for members at Geographically
Separated Units, and clarifies timelines and requirements for education/intervention. A margin bar
indicates newly revised material.


*1.12.7. Appoints a Unit Fitness Program Manager (UFPM).
*3.4.2. Marginal. Test within 90 days, but not during the first 45 days of achieving a marginal score.
*3.5.4.1. DELETED.
*3.5.4.2. DELETED.
*3.5.4.3. DELETED.
*3.6. Exemptions. Exemptions are designed to categorize members as unable or unavailable to train or
test for reasons beyond the control of the member or commander.

2.26. Administrative Changes (AC). Purely administrative changes that do not affect the subject matter
content, authority, purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication may be made by sub-
mitting an AF Form 673 signed by the certifying official to the publications/forms manager. Because
these types of changes are non-substantive, no coordination is required. There is no limit on the number
of administrative changes to a publication. Administrative Changes include:
   2.26.1. Office symbol changes (OPR, Certifying Official’s office symbol, and office symbols men-
   tioned in the text) due to a transfer of responsibility for a function or a publication, or as a result of a
   reorganization. Other changes may be made on a waiver basis (submit waiver requests to the SAF/
   AAX Workflow).
70                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     2.26.1. (USAFE) Other changes may be made on a waiver basis. For HQ USAFE publications, the
     OPR must submit a waiver request to USAFE CSS/SCXM (Publications Manager) prior to initiating
     any other paperwork. For publications below the HQ USAFE send the waiver request to the appropri-
     ate Publications Manager.
        2.26.1.1. Only OPRs may make administrative changes to their publications. The certifying offi-
        cial must sign the AF Form 673; SAF/AA will approve administrative changes to AFPDs and AF
        supplements to DODDs.
        2.26.1.2. ACs will not be integrated into the basic publication, but will appear when the publica-
        tion is opened from the e-Publishing site (readers will click on the publication link, the AC will
        pop up, and readers will have to click on a link to that publication from the AC screen). The AC
        notification will be removed when the publication is updated. OPRs must include ACs in an IC or
        a rewrite to incorporate changes into the actual publication.
        2.26.1.3. Submit a statement with the AC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font
        (e.g., References to AF/DP should be changed to AF/A1 throughout the publication; references to
        SAF/AAX should be changed to SAF/AA in paragraphs 1.5 and 3.6.). A date will be assigned to
        that AC when it is posted with the publication and placed at the end of the description of changes
        (see Figure 2.3.).
        2.26.1.4. ACs will be listed chronologically. It is the OPR’s responsibility to keep an updated list
        of ACs; OPRs will submit a complete list of all ACs each time a new AC is added. The date
        assigned to each previous AC must be incorporated into the document submitted by the OPR (e.g.
        References to AF/DP should be changed to AF/A1 throughout the publication; references to SAF/
        AAX should be changed to SAF/AA in paragraph 1.5 and 3.6. 15 March 2005.).
        2.26.1.5. Unless explicitly stated, the addition of an AC will not cancel existing ACs. If explicitly
        stated (e.g. References to AF/XOI should be changed to AF/A2; this supersedes the AC dated 31
        March 2006), “Canceled” will be inserted by the OPR next to the date of the superseded AC. Once
        an IC is made to a publication, or the publication is rewritten, all ACs posted for that publication
        will be removed from the e-Publishing website.

        2.26.1.6. (Added-USAFE) The Publications Managers must ensure that a copy of each Adminis-
        trative Change (AC), for publications within their area of responsibility, is filed in the applicable
        record set.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       71


2.27. Publication Rewrites. If you have made five ICs to your publication, or if more than 50% of your
publication requires revision, you must rewrite the entire publication and obtain mandatory and technical/
functional coordination. Both the certifying and approving officials must sign the AF Form 673. In addi-
tion to making the necessary content changes:
   2.27.1. State in the Summary of Changes paragraph “This document has been substantially revised
   and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include [insert summary of major changes].”
   2.27.2. Remove references to “DELETED” text made during an IC and re-number the publication
   accordingly.
   2.27.3. Ensure all references (including cross-references within the text, references to additional pub-
   lications, references to forms, and references to specific offices and individuals) are verified and
   updated as required.
   2.27.4. Submit the rewritten publication with a fully coordinated and signed AF Form 673 to your
   publications/forms manager for processing. After the rewrite is posted to the e-Publishing website,
   AFDPO will notify the OPR, with a courtesy copy to the publications/forms manager. OPRs are
   encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and
   posted on the e-Publishing website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that
   related publications and/or processes may be affected.
   2.27.5. Initiate a review and update, if necessary, of any forms prescribed by the publication. See
   Chapter 3 for more information on reviewing and updating forms.

2.28. Unauthorized Changes to Publications. Rewrites or changes that are not processed IAW guid-
ance in this publication are unauthorized and unofficial. When an activity receives a revised publication
or notice of a change issued by methods other than those prescribed in this publication, immediately
notify the publications/forms manager by e-mail or memorandum (contact SAF/AAX for departmental
publications with a courtesy copy to AFDPO-PPP). The publications/forms manager (or SAF/AAX, for
departmental publications) will immediately contact the OPR to establish a corrective course of action.
From the date the OPR is contacted the unauthorized change must be reprocessed IAW guidance in this
publication.
2.28. (USAFE) Contact the USAFE Publications Manager at USAFE CSS/SCXM.
   2.28.1. Draft publications are not for implementation or compliance. Publications are considered
   drafts until they have been certified, approved, and processed in accordance with this instruction.
   Release of any draft material for informational or review purposes must clearly indicate that the
   attached policy/guidance is still a draft and is not for implementation or compliance.

Section 2G—Rescinding Publications

2.29. Obsolete Publications. A publication becomes obsolete when another publication supersedes it,
when the OPR rescinds it, or when AFDPO removes it from the website, as will be case for expired
AFPMs, GMs, and outdated supplements.
   2.29.1. OPRs planning to rescind a publication must complete technical/functional coordination in
   addition to obtaining certification and approval using the AF Form 673. See Table 2.3. for technical/

          2.29.2.1. If the rescinded publication prescribes an Air Force form or a report, the OPR must
          include this information on the AF Form 673 and send a copy of the request for rescission to the
          information reports management and control office. Note: When a publication is rescinded, any
          prescribed forms or reports are rendered obsolete.
          2.29.2.2. If the publication is an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DODD, only the SECAF may
          rescind.
          2.29.2.3. If the publication implements a DOD Issuance, the OPR must clarify on the AF Form
          673 that the requirements are no longer valid or are met in a separate, active publication (list pub-
          lications, if applicable) and obtain SAF/AAX coordination in addition to other technical/func-
          tional coordination.
          2.29.2.4. Obsolete publications/forms are listed in the Product Index. Links to obsolete publica-
          tions are removed from the e-Publishing website and AFDPO releases a product announcement to
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                       73


       notify subscribers of the cancellation. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
       publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing website. The OPR
       notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes
       may be affected.
       2.29.2.5. ANG releases the NGB Publications Bulletin for notifying subscribers of cancellations
       on the NGB Publication site (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm). A copy of
       the NGB Publications Bulletin is sent to all Publications Distribution Office accounts.
       2.29.2.6. If an expired GM, AFPM, or an outdated supplement is removed from the e-Publishing
       website it is, in effect, cancelled. Any forms prescribed therein and any associated visual aids are
       also rendered obsolete. Since no AF Form 673 will exist for this action, the record set will include
       references to the appropriate sections in this AFI to justify the cancellation and “close out” the
       record set.

Section 2H—Special Publication Systems

2.30. Basis for Setting up a Special Publications System. Special publications exist to fulfill unique
publishing requirements for a narrowly defined audience (i.e. CFETPs, ATs, etc.). These publications
must identify in the opening paragraph their linkage with a parent publication listed in an AFSC series.
This system will not change or supersede any directive publication, form, or report that a directive publi-
cation prescribes. Special publications do not bypass the normal publishing process.
   2.30.1. Establishing a Special Publications System. Obtain approval to create a departmental-level
   system from SAF/AAX; obtain approval to create a field-level system from your local publications/
   forms manager. Describe the proposed system, including the type of publications you will issue, pub-
   lication specifications, coordination, certification, approval requirements, approximate cost, and pro-
   posed distribution. Explain why regular publications are not suitable. Reference the directive
   publication driving the need for the special publications system. Any form that the special publica-
   tions system requires must be prescribed in the publication establishing the special system. Once
   approval has been received, work with AFDPO or local publications/forms manager to establish the
   publishing process.

Section 2I—Records Management

2.31. Managing Records. The execution of processes and procedures prescribed in publications result in
the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force. Your local records professional will
help you identify appropriate records for preservation. Maintaining an accurate record set for each publi-
cation and form issued by the Air Force is a responsibility mandated by law. The record set for a publica-
tion must be maintained in a separate file from the record set for the prescribed form(s). Record sets for
publications and the prescribed form(s) may be stored in the same location, but the record sets must be
kept separate. Additionally, if preferable, OPRs may retire record sets for previous versions of a publica-
tion. If discrepancies exist in the Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), follow instructions in AFI 37-138
(will convert to AFI 33-364), Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-123
(will convert to AFMAN 33-363) to update the RDS.
   2.31.1. OPRs must ensure all records created and collected as a result of compliance with this publi-
   cation are correctly identified in the RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.
74                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     2.31.2. Add the following to the opening paragraph of all publications: “Ensure that all records cre-
     ated as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN
     37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
     with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.”
     2.31.3. As part of mandatory coordination, the local records manager will check the processes pre-
     scribed in the publication against the RDS. If the RDS requires modification, coordination may be
     delayed.
     2.31.4. The following provides an overview for those developing record sets for publications. Those
     responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in AFI 37-138 (will convert to AFI
     33-364); AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363); and AFI 33-322, Records Management
     Program, for making, maintaining, and disposing of records.
        2.31.4.1. OPRs at the HAF who develop publications are responsible for maintaining the official
        record sets. Field publications/forms managers, in conjunction with the senior communications
        and information manager, will determine who will maintain record sets locally. OPRs for depart-
        mental publications that are authored in the field must maintain the record set for that publication
        in accordance with local guidance from the publications/forms manager. Maintain a file arranged
        numerically by subject series for each publication that includes the following:
        2.31.4.1. (USAFE) The official record sets for HQ USAFE publications will be maintained at the
        USAFE Publications Office, including USAFE Headquarter Operating Instructions (USAFE-
        HOI).
            2.31.4.1.1. Records for AFPMs and GMs that are converted into “permanent” publications
            must become part of the record set for the permanent publication. AFPMs and GMs that are
            not converted into permanent publications should be disposed of in the same way as other
            memoranda.
            2.31.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) For any operating instructions (OI) or Guidance Memorandums
            (GM) created below the MOB level, the unit publications POC is required to maintain their
            own record set according to AFI 33-360 and this supplement.
            2.31.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Each OPR must maintain a copy of the record set for each pub-
            lication on which their office holds ownership.
        2.31.4.2. The original AF Form 673. AFDPO will maintain a copy of the AF Form 673 for publi-
        cations developed at the HAF (includes both the Air Staff and the Secretariat) for their own
        records; OPRs for departmental publications and forms generated at the HAF are responsible for
        maintaining their own record sets. Field OPRs developing departmental publications must main-
        tain and/or retire the original AF Form 673 in the record set in accordance with local guidance
        from the publications/forms manager. When a publication and form(s) are circulated for coordina-
        tion/action on the same AF Form 673 or AF IMT 1768 (SSS), keep the original in the publication
        record set and a copy of that record in the form record set.
        2.31.4.3. A copy of all published versions of the publication and any prescribed form(s);
        2.31.4.4. All documents that show coordination, comments, and other actions, such as changes
        (ICs, ACs, and rewrites), exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc., for the publication;
        2.31.4.5. A copy of each AF Form 673 used during biennial reviews for the publication;
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                      75


     2.31.4.5. (USAFE) A copy of each AF Form 673, used during the annual review for the publica-
     tion.
     2.31.4.6. Any additional forms required to process the publication (such as forms required when
     developing a printed product; the AF IMT 130, Application for a Report Control System (RCS), if
     used; or the DD 67, Form Processing Action Request, if making changes to a DOD form); and,
     2.31.4.7. If the publication directly implements a DOD Issuance, a copy of the signed and dated
     SD106, [DOD] Directives System Coordination Record, the Air Force memorandum with com-
     ments, the draft Issuance, and the final (signed) Issuance.
  2.31.5. Refer to the RDS (https://afrims.amc.af.mil/), AFI 33-364, AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to
  AFMAN 33-363), and AFI 33-322 for guidance on creating, maintaining, retiring, and disposing of
  record sets, including electronic record sets and record sets for publications falling under the federal
  vital records program.
  2.31.6. (Added-USAFE) Electronic Records. In addition to the official paper based record sets, the
  Publication Managers are required to establish an electronic publications archive. This is even appli-
  cable, if per paragraph 1.2.4.2.1. (Added), the MOB Communications Squadron Commander has
  determined that the official record sets are not maintained at the Publications Management Office.
  This requirement is based on the fact that all electronic files created during the tagging process by
  AFDPO can only be retrieved by the Publications Manager and not the OPR. See Table 2.4. (Added)
  below, for a more visual display of the archive.
     2.31.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Electronic Records Responsibility. The MAJCOM level publica-
     tions office maintains all paper and electronic record sets, except for classified publications (see
     paragraphs 1.2.3.2. and 2.20.4.1.4. (Added). The MOB publications office (base/wing) must, at a
     minimum include the tagged files returned from AFDPO. The publications POC at organizations
     below the MOB level (base/wing) must maintain the paper and electronic record set for all policy/
     guidance issued at their level.
     2.31.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Archive. This archive must be located on the organization’s official
     records storage drive (Storage Area Network (SAN)). This archive must contain the following
     folders:
         2.31.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Active: A separate folder for each current publication in the
         organization’s publications inventory. These folders are named according to the standard Air
         Force publications naming conventions and at the end including the publishing date. Example:
         AFI33-360_USAFESUP (1 Feb 2007), AFI 33-360_RABSUP (1 Oct 2007)). The inclusion of
         the publishing date will prevent overwriting official electronic records, if the publication is
         revised within the same year.
         2.31.6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Inactive: Fiscal Year (FY) folders containing all inactive/
         rescinded record set folders, which will be cut-off 31 December each year. These main inac-
         tive folders must be maintained until the actual records disposition time has been reached.
         These folders should be named, e.g.: Inactive &“Year” (i.e. Inactive 2007).
         2.31.6.2.3. (Added-USAFE) If guidance on the creation and disposition for these electronic
         record sets is required, contact your unit’s records custodian for guidance and assistance.
     2.31.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Each active publications folder should contain the following items:
76                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


             2.31.6.3.1. (Added-USAFE) An electronic copy of the draft submitted by the OPR.
             2.31.6.3.2. (Added-USAFE) If the publication is a supplement, a copy of the basic publica-
             tion.
             2.31.6.3.3. (Added-USAFE) All electronic files returned from the Central Tagging Office
             (CTO), only applicable for publications processed by the CTO.
             2.31.6.3.4. (Added-USAFE) A subfolder called “Correspondence”, containing copies of all
             electronic correspondence received during the life cycle of the publication, to include: elec-
             tronic copy of AF Form 673, email coordination, coordination matrix, release approval from
             the OPR, annual reviews, waivers, etc.), if provided in electronic format.
             2.31.6.3.5. (Added-USAFE) If the publication contains graphics, a copy of each graphic file.

Section 2J—Establishing a Functional Publications Library (FPL)

2.32. Definition.
   2.32.1. Commanders of organizations involved in flight operations are specifically authorized to
   establish and maintain FPLs, containing departmental- and field-level publications. The library will
   contain a copy of this instruction, the Product Index listing of included publications, and the product
   announcements.
       2.32.1.1. FPLs must link to electronic publications and forms available on the e-Publishing web-
       site. Classified/FOUO publications and forms may be posted directly to an FPL or printed.
   2.32.2. Flight operations commanders may establish FPLs by providing written notification to the
   servicing publishing manager. Identify the activity responsible for the library, its location, and appoint
   a primary and alternate library custodian. Officials establishing FPLs will ensure custodians are prop-
   erly trained on publications management. Custodians are responsible for ensuring FPL contents are
   both current and essential.

2.33. Availability of FPL Publications. Publications kept in an FPL may be loaned to authorized per-
sons for official use. Loaning publications is optional and depends on local needs. Do not allow the gen-
eral public to view, copy, or borrow any publication from an FPL (DOD 5400.7-R_AFSUP1). Since FPLs
are not open to the public, FOUO publications may be filed with other publications.

2.34. Obtaining Publications. Request paper-based publications from the Document Automation Pro-
duction Service (DAPS) at unit expense. The e-Publishing website provides a link to the DAPS website
for easy access to this bulk printing service.

2.35. Maintaining an FPL. FPL custodians will review product announcements and the Product Index
on the e-Publishing website to ensure publications contained in the library are current and essential. Cus-
todians will regularly review and inventory the contents of the FPL to ensure publications are current and
essential. Document the inventory, discrepancies noted, corrective action taken, and individual conduct-

                                      FORMS MANAGEMENT

Section 3A—Overview

3.1. General. This section establishes Air Force guidance, assigns responsibilities, and provides specific
procedures for the management of Air Force forms. It applies to all media of forms, whether paper or
electronic. It covers the complete lifecycle management of forms from creation, distribution, use, review,
and revision to cancellation.
   3.1.1. Definition of a Form. Per DOD Instruction 7750.07, DOD Forms Management Program, a
   form is a fixed arrangement of captioned spaces designed for entering and extracting prescribed infor-
   mation. Air Force forms are tools used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information
   whereby a predetermined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive Air
   Force purpose or objective. Official Air Force form types are defined in Section 3B. Prescribed forms
   require an AF Form 673, a control number, and a record set; non-prescribed forms do not require an
   AF Form 673, a control number, or a record set, although maintenance of a record set may be helpful
   to owners and users of non-prescribed forms.
       3.1.1.1. Previously, IMTs and forms were used synonymously. The IMT designator is being
       phased out; it will continue to appear until all publications and forms bearing that reference are
       updated.
   3.1.2. Only civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign national employees, but not including
   contractors or indirect-hire foreign national employees) and/or military members of the Air Force are
   authorized to serve as the POC for, provide coordination on, certify, and /or approve official Air Force
   publications and forms, including interservice publications where the Air Force serves as the lead ser-
   vice.
   3.1.3. Waiver requests regarding form use or processing must be submitted to the form OPR; send
   requests via e-mail or memorandum, explaining the need for the waiver. If deemed necessary by the
   OPR, the waiver request may be elevated within the organization for review and approval. If the
   waiver is granted, the waiver must be filed with the record set. A waiver remains in effect until the
   OPR cancels it in writing, the form is updated or canceled, or the waiver expires (the expiration date
   must be specified in the documentation granting the waiver). Include a statement in the opening para-
   graph of the prescribing publication if no waivers are authorized for forms prescribed therein.

Section 3B—Types of Forms

3.2. Types of Forms. The type of form is determined by the scope of its intended use and is indicated by
the form designation (e.g. AF Form 673, AFMC Form 226). If the scope of users expands or contracts, the
form should be redesignated and reprocessed as necessary.

acceptable. Any form collecting information covered by the Privacy Act must be managed as a prescribed form.)
Type                                 Description                                     Issued by
Office                               Forms for use only within the              All levels
                                     originating directorate, division, branch,
                                     section or office. OPRs disseminate
                                     office forms.
One-time                             Forms that satisfy a one-time             All levels
                                     requirement, are not reused or reprinted,
                                     and are obsolete when the expiration
                                     date is met. The OPR distributes the
                                     forms directly to activities required to
                                     complete the project. Place “One-time”
                                     in parentheses following the form
                                     number and show the expiration date
                                     next to it (e.g., (One-time, Expires 20
                                     January 2006)). The expiration date
                                     must not exceed 1 year. OPRs
                                     disseminate one-time forms.
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                                       81


Type                                     Description                               Issued by
Test                                     Test forms are established to be used for All levels
                                         a limited period of time so they may be
                                         evaluated before becoming permanent.
                                         Life of a test form may not exceed 1
                                         year. The OPR is responsible for
                                         converting these forms to a permanent
                                         form by no later than the expiration date.
                                         If not converted to a permanent form,
                                         they automatically become obsolete on
                                         the expiration date. State “Test” in
                                         parentheses following the form number
                                         and show the expiration date next to it
                                         (e.g., Test, Expires 20 January 2006).
                                         OPRs disseminate test forms.
Morale, Welfare, Recreation and          Forms used in the operation of the    MWRS offices
Services (MWRS)                          MWRS for internally imposed
                                         requirements. Give forms management
                                         support to MWRS activities on a
                                         case-by-case basis. The MWRS activity
                                         pays any printing costs.
NOTE: Some actions may require use of non-Air Force forms, such as DOD forms (DD forms), standard government forms
(SFs), optional forms (OFs), General Services Administration forms (GSA forms), General Accounting Office forms (GAO
forms), etc. Users will be instructed when use of non-Air Force forms is necessary. AFDPO may assist OPRs with other types
of forms, but does not monitor forms posted on non-Air Force websites.

3.3. Items Not Managed as Forms (per guidance in DODI 7750.07):
   3.3.1. Forms used exclusively for cryptological activities.
   3.3.2. Forms used only once as part of a survey.
   3.3.3. Formatted documents that are largely narrative in nature where the space needed by respon-
   dents to furnish the desired information varies substantially, such as a comment matrix, worksheet,
   classroom evaluations, or permission slip. Exception: Manage these types of documents as prescribed
   forms if they solicit information covered by the Privacy Act of 1974, collect information from the
   public, or require Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval.
   3.3.4. Formatted documents without spaces for entering information, such as instruction sheets and
   bulletins, pamphlets, notices, contract clause sheets, placards, certain tags and labels, pattern letters,
   guide letters, and form letters.
   3.3.5. Tools used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a predeter-
   mined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive AF purpose or objec-
   tive that are not prescribed in an official publication or otherwise defined in this instruction, such as
   login screens or meeting sign-in sheets.

Section 3C—Form Development

3.4. Official Form Repository. The e-Publishing website is the official source for obtaining prescribed/
adopted forms generated by Air Force OPRs, both electronic and physical, with the exception of ANG
wing/subunit prescribed forms and those generated below the wing/base level. Because a restricted/clas-
sified departmental publishing site is not yet available, field publishing activities may post electronic clas-
sified and FOUO forms on the local headquarters SIPRNET site. All classified and FOUO forms posted
on a headquarters SIPRNET site must be listed under an unclassified title in the Product Index on the
e-Publishing website.
     3.4.1. “Stocked and Issued” forms are distributed directly by the OPR. The office symbol and mailing
     address of the OPR are listed after the form title in the Product Index; users must submit requests
     directly to the OPR. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a reprint is necessary.
     3.4.2. “Stocked and Used” forms are distributed by the OPR only within the primary organization,
     and used only by that activity. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a reprint is neces-
     sary.
     3.4.3. ANG field publications will be submitted to the local wing forms managers, and are not sent to
     AFDPO for processing or posting. The official repository for ANG forms is the NGB-DMJ-P (http://
     www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/publications.htm).

3.5. Prescribing a Form. A new form and the prescribing publication must be published and distributed
simultaneously. This is not the case for revised forms. The prescribing publication:
     3.5.1. Directs organizations and individuals to use the form.
     3.5.2. Cites the form number, and long title, (e.g., AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action
     Request) the first time the form is mentioned. Thereafter, only cite the designation and number (i.e.,
     AF Form 673), unless the title would clarify the text.
     3.5.3. States the purpose of the form, how to complete it (if necessary), and how to submit it.
     3.5.4. Explains where to submit supply requests if the form is printed.
     3.5.5. Lists prescribed forms by form number and long title in the “Prescribed Forms” paragraph of
     the publication and on the AF Form 673 (Section I). (“Prescribed Forms” and “Adopted Forms” will
     be the last two paragraphs of the publication.)
     3.5.6. Do not include a copy of the prescribed form(s) within the publication unless absolutely neces-
     sary. This will help ensure version control, and may eliminate a need to update the publication each
     time a form is revised. If it is necessary to include a copy of the form, show sample entries.
     3.5.7. The prescribing publication does not need to be revised when a form is revised unless instruc-
     tions related to the revised form need to be updated.
     3.5.8. If a form at any level collects Privacy Act information it must be prescribed in an official pub-
     lication and managed in accordance with Privacy Act guidance.

3.6. Creating a Form. Forms Air Force-wide are designed using standard software acquired by AFDPO
and disseminated to all MAJCOM/FOA/DRU publications/forms managers. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU pub-
lications/forms managers may further distribute the forms software, if desired, to individuals designated
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                          83


by the publications/forms managers. All form control numbers are assigned by local publications/forms
managers and the records should be filed numerically by the form number. Form numbers are assigned
sequentially. To ensure forms are developed correctly:
   3.6.1. Identify all necessary data fields and create a sample form. OPRs will need to justify the need
   for the form, the data fields collected, and specify any printing and/or distribution requirements during
   coordination.
       3.6.1.1. Insert a releasability statement on the bottom of the form only if releasability is restricted
       (either when blank or when filled out). Examples of releasability statements include “RELEAS-
       ABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this publication may be released to NATO members
       only”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this publication may not be
       released to foreign nationals”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this form is
       classified/FOUO; requests for accessibility must be approved by the OPR,” etc. The statement
       must be prefaced with the phrase “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted.”
       3.6.1.2. Formats, definitions, data types, etc. already exist for many information fields commonly
       used in government forms. OPRs and forms designers should consult the DOD Metadata Registry
       to determine what form fields have been standardized and use standardized fields whenever possi-
       ble. The DOD Metadata Registry is accessible at https://metadata.dod.mil/mdrPortal; click on
       the “Data Element” tab to access standardized fields.
   3.6.2. The prototype used during coordination and the final version will be designed in conjunction
   with the local publications/forms manager.
   3.6.3. Utilize desktop software, such as Microsoft® applications, whenever possible to develop office
   forms. Office forms may also be created with the use of standard AF form software.
   3.6.4. The form manager will assign the date. AFDPO is the forms manager for HAF OPRs; dates
   assigned by AFDPO which will not exceed seven (7) business days after the publications/forms man-
   ager has received complete and correct materials from the OPR. Development work on the form may
   be completed while the form is routed for coordination or prior to coordination. Form OPRs at the
   HAF will complete development work during coordination; when form OPRs at the HAF submit the
   prototype to AFDPO for coordination, AFDPO will complete the development work at that time. The
   form date is the effective date; Air Force forms are not considered effective until they are released to
   users IAW this Instruction. AFDPO will alert the local publications/forms manager and the OPR
   when a new or revised form is posted on the e-Publishing website. OPRs are encouraged to notify
   affected staff offices when a form is rescinded or when a new or revised form is posted on the e-Pub-
   lishing website. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publica-
   tions and/or processes may be affected.

3.7. Adopting a Form. You may adopt an existing form prescribed in one publication (Air Force or
other government publication) for use in another publication. Adopted forms already exist and are avail-
able from the e-Publishing website, the Publishing Distribution Center (PDC), or, if adopting a form cre-
ated by a different government agency, the appropriate agency’s website. You may refer users to the
prescribing publication for instructions on completing and processing the form, adding additional instruc-
tions, if necessary. To determine the prescribing publication of an Air Force form, click on the “informa-
tion” icon in the form entry on the e-Publishing website.
84                                   AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


     3.7.1. Cite the form designator and number within the publication, including the long title in italics at
     first use; include the full citation in the “Adopted Forms” paragraph (e.g. AF Form 673, Air Force
     Publication/Form Action Request). List adopted forms in the “Adopted Forms” paragraph of the pub-
     lication (“Prescribed Forms” and “Adopted Forms” will be the last two paragraphs of the publication)
     and on the AF Form 673.
     3.7.2. If you adopt a form created by another government agency, you may be subject to that agency’s
     guidance. Work with the forms manager of the agency responsible for the form to ensure that the Air
     Force guidance/process aligns with that agency’s guidance/process. DOD forms created in IBM soft-
     ware must include the DOD disclaimer.
     3.7.3. If you intend to use an adopted form for a purpose not intended by the OPR, or you intend to
     alter the appearance of an adopted form, you must gain written permission from the form’s OPR to
     alter the use of the form.
     3.7.4. Overprint (pre-fill blocks with standard information) an electronic or physical form when the
     number of man-hours saved in filling in the form justifies the extra cost of overprinting the fill-in data.
     Do not alter lines or captions, or add blocks and captions to an existing form as this action is a revision
     of the original form design. This guidance applies to both physical and electronic forms. Insert a state-
     ment at the bottom of overprinted forms indicating the activity responsible for the overprinted mate-
     rial (e.g., “919 MDS Modified Overprint.”).
     3.7.5. Functional areas implementing information systems that incorporate existing forms must
     obtain written approval from the OPR. The system maintainer ensures the accuracy of forms used in
     the system.

3.8. Reports Control. Internal Air Force information requirements are licensed with a Report Control
Symbol (RCS) number. Insert the RCS field, if applicable, in the upper right corner of the form inside the
margin. The local publications/forms manager may consult with the local reports control manager who
will determine if an RCS is applicable to the form during the design phase. See AFI 33-324 for more
information, including interagency reporting, public use, forms, internal reporting, and use of the AF
Form 130, Application for a Reports Control Symbol (RCS).

3.9. Form Software Licenses. All forms must be licensed before being placed on the e-Publishing web-
site. Note: DD or other agency forms are not licensed unless they are designed in standard Air Force soft-
ware.
     3.9.1. DELETED
     3.9.2. The Form Viewer is openly available to any party with a valid requirement to access Air Force
     forms. It is available for download directly from the e-Publishing website.
        3.9.2.1. Form Designers will require a licensed version of the viewer.
        3.9.2.2. Applications Process Interface (API) licensing will be issued as required.

Section 3D—Legal and Security Requirements

3.10. Requirements and Considerations.
   3.10.1. Privacy Act of 1974 (AFI 33-332). Forms that collect personal data from individuals for
   inclusion in a Privacy Act (PA) system of records (a collection of records retrieved by an individual’s
   name or personal identifier), and forms that request the individual to enter or verify the social security
   number, must contain a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). The PAS allows the individual completing the
   form to make an informed decision about whether to furnish the information. Coordinate all proposed
   new or revised forms that collect personal data with the Privacy Act Officer (PAO) and/or servicing
   legal office on the AF Form 673. The PAO will assist with developing the PAS.
      3.10.1.1. Display PAS on the first page of the form, under the title if possible.
      3.10.1.2. Computer Matching Program. Computer matching is the electronic comparison of
      records from two or more automated systems between Federal agencies, state, and local govern-
      ments for verifying benefits, eligibility, and for debt collection purposes. Records involved
      include those from personnel and payroll systems and Federal benefit programs. If the information
      on the form is subject to computer matching, incorporate an appropriate warning into the PAS.
   3.10.2. United States Postal Service (USPS) Requirements. Forms used as mailers must meet USPS
   requirements. Refer to DODI 4525.8_AFSUP1, DOD Official Mail Manual, for requirements.
   3.10.3. Complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. All forms must be Section 508 com-
   pliant, as established in AFI 33-129. AFDPO is responsible for ensuring all products posted on the
   e-Publishing website are Section 508 compliant. Local publications/forms managers are responsible
   for ensuring products not posted to the e-Publishing website are Section 508 compliant. See AFI
   33-129 for guidance on making forms Section 508 compliant.
   3.10.4. Guidelines for Classified, Accountable, Storage Safeguarded, and FOUO forms. Anyone
   requesting the creation of these forms must ensure the forms have the required markings (see AFI
   31-401 and DODR 5400.7_AFSUP1). AFDPO will identify these forms in the numerical listing of the
   Product Index.
      3.10.4.1. Classified Forms. Avoid creating forms that disclose classified information and classi-
      fied titles. When a form title is classified, create an unclassified title for reference purposes. When
      designing a classified blank form, show the overall classification of the information at the top and
      bottom of the form design. If the form will become classified when filled in, leave sufficient space
      for the overall classification marking by adding the notation "_______ When Filled In" outside the
      margins at the top and bottom of each page of the form. Allow space for entering associated mark-
      ings, classification authority, and downgrading or declassification instructions if deemed neces-
      sary by the requester.
      3.10.4.2. Accountable Forms. Some blank forms can jeopardize installation/national security or
      could be used to defraud or allow false claims against the Government; therefore, you must con-
      trol, safeguard, and account for these forms. Contact AFDPO for further guidance on handling
      accountable forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
      3.10.4.3. Storing Safeguarded Forms. Safeguarded forms are not releasable outside DOD because
      they could be put to unauthorized or fraudulent use (e.g. general officer stationary). You need not

        account for each individual form, but you must store blank forms in a secure area. Contact
        AFDPO for further guidance on storing safeguarded forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
        3.10.4.4. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Forms. Mark and protect these forms as directed in DODR
        5400.7_AFSUP1.

Section 3E—Coordination Requirements

3.11. Coordination. New and obsolete forms marked for cancellation require mandatory and functional
coordination. Revised forms require mandatory coordination.
     3.11.1. Drafts of new forms should circulate with the prescribing publication for coordination. Follow
     guidance and procedures described in Section 2D to properly coordinate your form with the publica-
     tion. If only the form requires revision or is marked for cancellation, you may circulate your form
     independently of the prescribing publication; see Table 3.2. for mandatory coordination on indepen-
     dently coordinated forms, see Table 2.3. for technical/functional coordination.
        3.11.1.1. List all adopted and prescribed forms in block 11 of the AF Form 673, and fill out
        blocks 12 through 13 accordingly. If prescribing multiple forms, make use of block 32 to indicate
        classification (block 12a), control status (block 12b), and printing requirements (block 13) for
        each.
        3.11.1.2. OPRs must fill out form-specific information during regular two-year reviews or special
        out-of-cycle reviews. Make use of block 32 to include any information on the status of adopted
        and/or prescribed forms that does not fit in the regular blocks.
     3.11.2. The DOD forms manager granted the Air Force a waiver on October 24, 2005, allowing sole
     use of the AF Form 673 for all actions on Air Force forms. Use of the DD 67 form is only required
     when action is taken on a non-Air Force form for which the Air Force serves as the OPR. Submit an
     AF Form 673 for new, revised, or obsolete (marked for cancellation) forms. The completed AF Form
     673 and the form must be submitted to the local publications/forms manager for processing. The HAF
     publishing manager for departmental forms is AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil). See para-
     graph 2.18.2. for guidance on filling out the AF Form 673.
        3.11.2.1. If requesting an action on a DOD form for which the Air Force serves as the OPR submit
        a completed DD Form 67. DD Form 67 is prescribed by DOD 7750.7-M, DOD Forms Manage-
        ment Program Procedures Manual; refer to that publication and consult your publications/forms
        manager for instructions on completing DD Form 67.
        3.11.2.2. The certification and approval authorities for forms are the same as those for the pre-
        scribing publication.

Section 3F—Keeping Forms Current

3.12. Form Revision. An AF Form 673 showing coordination and certification is required to alter the
contents of the form. Submit the 673 and the draft form to the forms manager for processing and posting
(AFDPO is the forms manager for HAF OPRs (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil)). The revised form will
be redated. If applicable, indicate at the bottom of the form any supersession or disposition instructions,
and indicate on the form that superseded forms are not authorized for use (include the date of the super-
seded form). Exception: OPRs may work directly with forms designers to make any purely technical
“fixes” to electronic forms (e.g., alignment of fields, order of tabs, enabling for digital signatures, etc.).
Technical fixes must not alter the layout or the purpose of the form; forms updated in this manner will not
be redated and do not require a supersession line. Submit technical fixes to forms designers in writing (via
email or memorandum). Changes to the layout or the purpose of the form do require coordination. Note:
The OPR must ensure that guidance related to altered forms in the prescribing publication is correct.
OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a form is revised and posted to the e-Publishing
website.
   3.12.1. Forms will be reviewed every two years along with the prescribing publication. OPRs will be
   asked to provide the form status on an AF Form 673 generated by the publications/forms manger.
   Both the OPR and the certifying official must sign the AF Form 673 during two-year and special
   reviews.

3.13. Rescinding a Form. A form becomes obsolete when another form supersedes it, when the OPR
rescinds it, or when the prescribing publication is rescinded. If the OPR wishes to continue use of the
form, it must be prescribed in an active publication. Obsolete publications/forms are listed in the Product
88                                  AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008


Index. Links to obsolete forms are removed from the e-Publishing website and AFDPO releases a product
announcement to notify subscribers of the cancellation. ANG releases the NGB Publications Bulletin for
notifying subscribers of cancellations on the NGB Publication site (http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/
publications.htm). A copy of the NGB Publications Bulletin is sent to all Publications Distribution
Office accounts. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a form is rescinded. The OPR
notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be
affected.
     3.13.1. If you are canceling the prescribing publication the prescribed form will be canceled at the
     same time—it is not necessary to submit more than one AF Form 673; simply clarify in the “Addi-
     tional Information” block that the cancellation applies to both the publication and the form. If you are
     rescinding a form or a report but maintaining the prescribing publication, the OPR must complete
     mandatory coordination (Table 3.2.), obtain certification and approval, submit a completed AF Form
     673 to the publications/forms manager, and send a copy of the request for rescission to the information
     reports management and control office. If the form is classified, reference AFI 31-401 for actions
     required to rescind.
     3.13.2. OPRs are responsible for ensuring that any references made to obsolete forms, either pre-
     scribed or adopted, are removed from active publications. See Section 2F on making changes to pub-
     lications.

Section 3G—Records Management

3.14. Records Management. The execution of processes and procedures prescribed in publications
results in the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force. Maintaining an accurate
record set for each form issued by the Air Force is a responsibility mandated by law. The record set for a
form must be maintained in a separate file from the record set for the prescribing publication. Record sets
for publications and the prescribed form(s) may be stored in the same location, but the record sets must be
kept separate. Adopted forms do not require a record set. If discrepancies exist in the Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS), follow instructions in AFI 37-138 (will convert to AFI 33-364), Records Disposi-
tion-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363) to update
the RDS.
     3.14.1. OPRs must ensure all records created and collected as a result of compliance with this publi-
     cation are correctly identified in the RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.
     3.14.2. As part of mandatory coordination, the local records manager will review the form.
     3.14.3. The following provides an overview for those developing record sets for publications/forms.
     Those responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in AFI 37-138 (will convert to
     AFI 33-364); AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363); and AFI 33-322, Records Manage-
     ment Program, for making, maintaining, and disposing of records.
        3.14.3.1. OPRs at the HAF who develop forms are responsible for maintaining the official record
        sets. Field publications/forms managers, in conjunction with the senior communications and infor-
        mation manager, will determine who will maintain record sets locally. Maintain a file arranged
        numerically for each form that includes the following:
        3.14.3.2. A copy of each published version of the form. If the form is circulated for coordination
        without the prescribing publication, include the original AF Form 673 in the record set. AFDPO
AFI33-360_USAFESUP_LAJESFIELDSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2008                                                     89


       will maintain a copy of the AF Form 673 for publications or forms developed at the HAF (includes
       both the Air Staff and the Secretariat) for their own records; OPRs for departmental forms gener-
       ated at the HAF are responsible for maintaining their own record sets. Field OPRs developing
       departmental forms will have their publications/forms managers maintain and/or retire the original
       AF Form 673 in the record set. When a publication and form(s) are circulated for coordination/
       action on the same AF Form 673 or SSS, keep the original in the publication record set and a copy
       of that record in the form record set.
       3.14.3.3. A copy of the published version of the prescribing publication and form.
       3.14.3.4. All documents that show coordination, comments, and other actions, such as changes,
       exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc., for the form.
       3.14.3.5. A copy of the AF Form 673 used during each two-year review (the original should
       reside in the record set for the publication).
       3.14.3.6. Any additional forms required to process the form (such as forms required when devel-
       oping a printed product; the AF IMT, Application for a Report Control System (RCS), if used; or
       the DD 67, Form Processing Action Request, if making changes to a DOD form).
       3.14.3.7. Copies of form-related waivers granted and system form approvals (see paragraph
       3.7.5.).
   3.14.4. Refer to AFI 37-138 (will convert to AFI 33-364); AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN
   33-363); and AFI 33-322 for guidance on creating, maintaining, retiring, and disposing of electronic
   record sets.

Terms
Accountable Forms—Forms that the Air Force stringently controls and which cannot be released to
unauthorized personnel, since their misuse could jeopardize DOD security or result in fraudulent financial
gain or claims against the government.
Administrative Change—Change that does not affect the subject matter content, authority, purpose,
application, and/or implementation of the publication (e.g., changing the POC name, office symbol(s),
fixing misspellings, etc.)
Administrative Comments—Comments made during the coordination process to address typographical,
grammatical, and formatting errors.
Adopted Form—A form used (required) in a publication other than the prescribing publication.
Air Force-wide—Includes Headquarters Air Force (HAF: Secretariat and Air Staff), MAJCOMs, FOAs,
DRUs, centers, wings, bases, and below.
Approval Authority—Senior leader responsible for contributing to and implementing policies and
guidance/procedures pertaining to his/her functional area(s) (e.g., heads of functional two-letter offices).
Authentication—Required element to verify approval of the publication; the approval official applies
his/her signature block to authenticate the publication. The signature block includes the official’s name,
rank, and title (not signature).
Central Tagging Operation—The e-Publishing component that transforms electronic publications to
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and other
distribution formats. The central tagging operation also performs electronic supplement integration.
Certifying Official—A minimum of one organizational level above the OPR, this individual certifies the
need for the publication, to include currency of information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety
of content.
Critical Comment—A comment made during the coordination process that addresses area(s) of such
major deficiency as to preclude final approval. Critical comments result in a “nonconcurrence” and must
be resolved by the OPR prior to publication.
Directive Publication—Publication that is necessary to meet the requirements of law, safety, security, or
other areas where common direction and standardization benefit the Air Force. Air Force personnel must
comply with these publications. All publications in this category carry the following statement:
“COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY.”
Distribution—Defines the type of accessibility for each publication; to whom the publication may be
released.
Document Automation Production Service (DAPS)—A “Fee-for-Service” organization that provides
document automation products, bulk printing, and distribution services.
e-Publishing—Central website for accessing, viewing, downloading, and printing electronic products;
physical products may be ordered from the e-Publishing website. Information on product development
and links to other agency publications are also provided on the e-Publishing website
(www.e-publishing.af.mil, which will convert to www.af.mil/e-publishing on AF Link).

Form—A tool used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a
predetermined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive Air Force purpose
or objective. Official Air Force form types are defined in Section 3B.
Functional Principal—senior leader, generally at the two-letter level, who serves as the approving
official for publications.
Functional Publications Library—A unit or staff office library that contains only publications needed
for the mission in a specific functional area.
Guidance and Procedures—Specifics instructions that implement policy; establish a process to
complete a task, project, or execute a program.
Headquarters Air Force (HAF)—The HAF is comprised of both Secretariat and Air Staff offices.
Implementing Publication—A publication that creates processes and sets standards to accomplish a
goal, often by adding organization-specific material to a publication issued by a higher headquarters.
Information Management Tool (IMT)—See Form. Previously, IMTs and forms were used
synonymously; the IMT designator is being phased out in order to simplify publishing terms. The IMT
designator will continue to appear until all publications and forms bearing that reference are updated.
Lead Agent—The organization that controls or directs the course of a task, event, or process.
Mandatory Coordination—Required review by selected offices prior to publication. Mandatory
coordinators review draft publications for specific functional and/or legal purposes.
Nondirective Publication—Nondirective publications are informational and suggest guidance that you
can modify to fit the circumstances. Complying with publications in this category is expected, but not
mandatory. Air Force personnel use these publications as reference aids, “how-to” guides, or as sources of
official information.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—The originating office for a publication; the author of the
publication is an individual within the OPR. OPRs are solely responsible for the accuracy, currency, and
integrity of their publications and forms.
Point of Contact (POC)—The individual designated by the OPR to meet all OPR responsibilities. POC
