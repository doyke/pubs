AFI34-201_JBSANANTONIOSUP 22 JULY 2014                                                          3




4.3.4.1. Authorized events will be funded by Unit Enhancement Funds, a subset of SM& W
Funds. The amount authorized is allocated per person and is based on fiscal year-end strength on
the unit manning document. Requestor should check with the FSS operating location POC for
the current fiscal year amount. A proportionate amount of the total authorization will be
included in the MWR Fund NAF Income and Expense Budget for approval by 502d Air Base
Wing Commander (502 ABW/CC), through the NAF Council.
           4.3.4.2. (Added) The 502 ABW/CC may increase the annual per person allocation if
           the MWR Fund is meeting or exceeding Air Force financial goals. Should the MWR
           Fund financial position warrant, the 502 ABW/CC may curtail all unit enhancement
           funding until the financial status has improved. Unit enhancement allocations will
           not exceed $2.00 per person annually, regardless of financial condition.
              4.3.4.2.1. (Added) The 502 ABW/CC may increase or decrease, depending upon
              the financial conditions of MWR Fund, the annual per person allocation of unit
              enhancement fund. However, the allocations will not exceed $2.00 per person
              annually, regardless of financial condition.
           4.3.4.3. (Added) Any increase or decrease in the per person allocation will be in
           writing, signed by the installation commander, and made a matter of record in the
           NAF Council minutes.
           4.3.4.4. (Added) The 502 ABW NAF Resource Manager (RM) or designee will
           review all unit requests to ensure proposed use is authorized and funding is within
           budgeted limits.
           4.3.4.5. (Added) Generally, unit enhancement funds are used for unit holiday
           parties, picnics, and other unit social events open to all active duty military members
           and DOD civilian employees working fulltime on the installation and directly
           supporting the unit.
           4.3.4.6. (Added) Funds may be used for food, decorations, facility rental (if on base
           or post), non-alcoholic beverages, entertainment, paper/plastic utensils, plates, cups,
           napkins, etc., in support of the unit function. Unit enhancement funds are not
           authorized for the purchase of alcoholic beverages, games, or prizes for the event.
           4.3.4.7. (Added) Use of installation MWR facilities and services is strongly
           encouraged for functions funded through the unit enhancement program. These funds
           are part of the revenues generated through use of JBSA programs and by using them
           in JBSA facilities the funds go back into the programs for further benefit of our joint
           base community.
           4.3.4.8. (Added) 502 ABW units, mission partners, and associate units will submit
           requests for unit enhancement funds using the procedures in Attachment 9 and the
           example request template in Attachment 10.
              12.2.1.2.1. (Added) The 502 ABW/CC delegates the approval authority for
              recurring SM&W functions to the 502d Force Support Squadron (502 FSS)
              Commander/Director and Deputy Commander or Deputy Director and to the 502
              ABW/RM.

       12.2.1.6.1. (Added) Petty cash imprest funds will not be issued to units for
       SM&W purchases, as this could lead to circumventing the requirement to obtain
       advance approvals for all SM&W expenditures.
    12.2.3.1. (Added) Submit requests to the servicing 502 FSS NAF Accounting Office
    at least 10 workdays prior to the date of the event for which funds are being
    requested. That office will review the request for completeness and forward it to the
    appropriate officials for review, coordination, and approval/disapproval. Upon
    approval/disapproval, the request will be returned to the 502 NAF Accounting
    Offices, which will notify the requesting POC. Reimbursable receipts must be
    received by the 502 FSS/FSR offices within 2 working days but always as of last
    work day of the month of the event or risk non-reimbursement (See attachment 11)
    12.2.3.2. (Added) It is the responsibility of the requesting office to follow-up if they
    have not received an answer within 2 workdays of the event. No funds should be
    spent with the expectation of SM&W reimbursement prior to receipt of an approved
    request. No expenditures will be reimbursed using SM&W funds if the approval was
    not obtained in advance of the event. Waivers to this requirement will not be
    considered under any circumstance.
    12.2.3.3. (Added) As with all MWR non-appropriated funds, SM&W funds are
    generated through patronage of services facilities such as the golf course, the club,
    and bowling center. When a request for funds for an event or function is approved,
    the unit has options to use those funds to procure goods or services on-base or off-
    base. By using MWR activities whenever possible, those funds go back into the
    MWR programs to be used once again in support of the JBSA community.
    Therefore, the preferred and recommended sources for use of SM&W funds are the
    JBSA MWR activities, AAFES facilities, or the commissary for goods and services.
    These facilities should be given the right of first refusal for hosting functions that use
    SM&W funds.
       12.2.3.3.1. (Added) Use of installation MWR facilities and services is strongly
       encouraged for functions funded through the SM&W. These funds are part of the
       revenues generated through use of JBSA programs and by using them in JBSA
       facilities the funds go back into the programs for further benefit of our joint base
       community.
    12.3.1.3. (Added) The 502 FSS NAF RM or designee will prepare updates to the
    SM&W budget and submit them in the quarterly budget revisions through the NAF
    Council to the 502 ABW/CC for approval.
       12.3.3.2.1. (Added) The JBSA MWR Fund custodian will appoint a memento
       custodian for any inventory stock maintained, and appoint individuals to assist the
       memento custodian to conduct an annual independent inventory of all SM&W
       memento and/or refreshment stocks. Provide copies of completed inventories to
       the 502 ABW/RM and Comptroller. Submit requests for purchases of memento
       inventory stock to the servicing FSS/FSR office for processing.

            ceremonies are not held for at the unit level) that include all ranks, both officer

            separate funding is authorized for group ceremonies for equivalent units, i.e.,
            mission partners, direct reporting units (DRUs), and field operating agencies
            (FOA) that receive MWR support from JBSA. Funds are authorized not to

UNIT ENHANCEMENT FUNDS REQUEST AND REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES

A9.1. JBSA units, mission partners, and associate units prepare requests for unit enhancement
funds using the request template at Attachment 10 to ensure all required information is provided.
The commander or first sergeant of the requesting unit must sign the request. Submit requests to
the servicing FSS NAF Accounting Office (FSS/FSR) either in hard copy, via email, or fax, at
least 10 workdays prior to the function or event. Failure to submit timely request may result in
unapproved funding due to coordination requirements.

available funding to ensure the request does not exceed available funds, and submit to 502
ABW/RM for approval.
A9.3. The local FSS/FSR will notify the unit point of contact (POC) of approval/disapproval
and provide them with a copy of the approval. No funds should be expended with anticipation of
support until the POC has an approved request. Expenditures made without proper advance
approval will not be reimbursed.
A9.4. The unit may elect to request a purchase order through the servicing FSS/FSR office to
make purchases prior to the event, or may elect to obtain cash advance prior to the event or
function. In either case, supporting documentation is required for all expenditures.
A9.5. If reimbursement of expenditures is to be made following the event; the POC must submit
all original itemized receipts (copies will not be accepted) to the servicing FSS/FSR office within
5 workdays following the event or risk losing reimbursement. Expenditures will be reviewed
and validated and cash reimbursement will be made to the unit POC within 2 workdays after
submission but always as of last work day of the month.
