SCOTTAFBI48-106 15 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                         3


   2.1. Dogs and cats that are 4 months old or more and maintained on base will be immunized for
   rabies. Dogs and cats will be reimmunized for rabies every 3 years following the first rabies vaccine
   IAW Illinois Department of Animal Health requirements. Base Housing occupants that own pets will
   report to the Veterinary Services within 14 days of moving on base so a base certificate and tag can be
   issued. Dogs and cats moving on base with 3-year rabies vaccinations will be recognized until the
   3-year expiration date. However, all pet owners must update their pet’s vaccine records annually.
   2.2. DD Form 2208, Rabies Vaccination Certificate, will be completed at the time of immunization
   or issuance of a new tag. The owner will keep the original certificate; VTF will file one copy; and one
   copy will be placed in the animal’s record.
   2.3. Other Immunizations and Requirements.
       2.3.1. Dogs maintained on base will be immunized for canine distemper, infectious canine hepa-
       titis, parainfluenza, leptospirosis, and parvovirus following current accepted immunization prac-
       tices.
       2.3.2. Cats maintained on base will be immunized for feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and pan-
       leukopenia, following current accepted immunization practices.
       2.3.3. In conjunction with vaccinations, dogs or cats that are 4 months of age and under will be
       routinely dewormed.
       2.3.4. All dogs maintained on base will be tested for heartworms every year with the recommen-
       dation that the dog is kept on heartworm prevention year round. A dog that arrives on base without
       being on prevention will require a Heartworm Test. The OIC, Veterinary Services, has determined
       that dogs testing positive for heartworms will receive treatment at the Scott AFB VTF, an appro-
       priate civilian facility, or the dogs will be removed from base.

3. Rabies Suspect Disposition.
   3.1. Animal or pet that has bitten or scratched an individual will be kept in quarantine for at least 10
   days. The OIC, Veterinary Services, may direct quarantine in a civilian veterinary facility or in the
   owner's home depending on the circumstances. Home quarantine requires the owner to bring the ani-
   mal for examination to the VTF at a time and frequency specified by the OIC, Veterinary Services.
   3.2. There are some species of animal pets that require no quarantine as determined by the OIC, Vet-
   erinary Services.
   3.3. In the event a stray/wild animal is designated as a rabies suspect, the animal will be humanely
   euthanized and diagnostic specimens submitted to the proper authorities for Rabies Virus Examina-
   tion.

4. Individuals Bitten/Scratched by Animals. An individual exposed to a rabies suspect should report to
the 375 MDG, Emergency Services, for treatment.

5. Migratory Game Birds and Animals. Federal rules on migratory game birds and animals and the
State of Illinois Game and Fish Code apply to Scott AFB. Federal and state regulations and codes protect
many species of wildlife. Possession of birds or animals governed by these regulations and codes will be
directed by administrative order from the Department of the Interior or the State of Illinois. Requests to

possess wildlife on Scott AFB must have written coordination from the 375 MSG/CC Commander or 375
MSG/CD, Base Veterinarian, Department of Interior, and the State of Illinois.

6. Control of Pets.
    6.1. All dogs must be on a leash/restraint device or tethered to a stake when outside of the quarters.
    The pet must be under adult supervision at all times. Dogs enclosed in a secure fenced area do not
    require constant adult supervision; however, an adult must be at the quarters. Dogs taken for walks
    must be supervised.
    6.2. Cats are not required to be on a leash. However, if a complaint is filed with the 375 SFS, the cat
    is subject to being removed from base.

    NOTE: The only exception to this rule is fish.
    6.4. Pet owners may be held financially liable for damage, destruction, injury, veterinary care, eutha-
    nasia, or removal of pets from Scott AFB when directed by the 375 MSG/CC or 375 MSG/CD.
    6.5. Animals will not be permitted in any buildings on base, except for Base Housing units. Animal
    pets will not be allowed in airmen dormitories (see exceptions), temporary lodging quarters (TLQ),
    bachelor officer quarters (BOQ), visiting airmen quarters (VAQ), or any other public facility on Scott
    AFB. The grounds adjoining TLQs, BOQs, and VAQs are also prohibited to pets. Animals will not be
    left unattended in cars parked outside of these facilities. Exceptions are aquariums (375 CES/
    CDM-CEH will determine what animals are allowed in the dormitories); Health Assistance Animals
    in the Military (HAAM) (i.e., Seeing-Eye dogs, hearing dogs, and other handicap assistance animals)
    will be allowed to enter all public facilities with their owners including TLQs, BOQs, and VAQs.

7. Procedures.
    7.1. The 375 SFS/SFAR will prepare a “Show Cause” letter signed by 375 MSG/CC or 375 MSG/CD
    to the pet owners regarding all pet-related incidents (Attachment 3 of this instruction).
    7.2. The owner will acknowledge receipt of the show cause letter at the time of issue, and he/she will
    indicate their intent as outlined in Attachment 3 of this instruction.
    7.3. The 375 SFS/SFA will track and suspense all “Show Cause” letters. If the owner has not
    responded within 10 days, 375 SFS/SFA will notify the 375 MSG/CC or 375 MSG/CD that a pet
    removal letter has been forwarded to the individual through their unit commander (Attachment 4 of
    this instruction). The unit commander will ensure that the owner has removed the pet from Scott AFB
    within 5 days of receipt of the letter. The unit commander will inform 375 SFS/SFA of the disposition
    of the pet through the 375 MSG/CC or 375 MSG/CD.
    7.4. Once notified of a pet-related incident that could result in the removal of the pet from Scott AFB,
    the owner may request a meeting with 375 MSG/CD. If it is determined that the animal will be
    removed from Scott AFB, the unit commander will be notified by the 375 MSG and will be responsi-
    ble for ensuring the owner removes the pet within 5 days. The unit commander will also inform 375
    SFS/SFA of the disposition of the pet.

8. Care and Housing of Pets.
SCOTTAFBI48-106 15 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                            5


   8.1. Pets will be kept in a well-ventilated area with ample lighting. Pets must have adequate protec-
   tion while outside from inclement weather or sunlight.
   8.2. Pets must be provided good food that is free of contamination, fed at least once a day unless oth-
   erwise directed by a veterinarian; food and surrounding areas maintained; provided fresh drinking
   water daily.
   8.3. Owners must ensure cleanliness of pets and surrounding areas. Excreta dropped by pets will be
   removed daily to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors including when dogs are taken for walks.
   Failure to comply with this provision can result in the pet being declared a nuisance and subsequently
   being removed from the base.
   8.4. Doghouses are prohibited.
   8.5. Owners will not leave a pet unattended in an outside fenced area. This guidance will ensure pets
   are protected from inclement weather and will eliminate the possibility of the pet creating a nuisance
   to other residents.

9. Animals, Reptiles, and Birds Prohibited on Scott AFB.
   9.1. Animals, reptiles, and birds banned by state and federal laws.
   9.2. Wild, exotic, or undomesticated animals (e.g., forest/jungle beasts, potbellied pigs, or other wild-
   life). The following pets are prohibited: raccoons, opossums, skunks, groundhogs, bats, squirrels, and
   wild carnivores. The Base Veterinarian will investigate questionable cases and advise 375 MSG/CC,
   who will make the final decision if a wildlife, exotic, or undomesticated animal is prohibited.
   9.3. Poisonous reptiles or large constrictor-type snakes.
   9.4. Animals kept for profit or gain. This instruction does not include the normal procreation of any
   kind, sale of offspring, or fees from breeding a pet. Questionable cases will be investigated by the
   Base Veterinarian, who will advise the 375 MSG/CC or 375 MSG/CD on the final disposition.
   9.5. The provisions for fowl (other than small-caged birds) apply (paragraph 6. of this instruction).
   Aviaries are not permitted.
   9.6. Hoofed animals, except when kept in a designated base area and which qualify as riding, draft, or
   show animals. An exception to this provision is an area where grazing rights are granted by the 375
   MSG/CC.
   9.7. Pit bull breed dogs (American pit bull terrier, Staffordshire bull terrier, American Staffordshire
   bull terrier, etc.). The inbred aggressive nature of this breed creates a potentially dangerous safety haz-
   ard. Pit bull owners residing off base will be allowed access to the VTF.

10. Disposal of Dead Animals Found on Scott AFB.
   10.1. In accordance with SAFBI 32-1002, Pest Management Program, paragraph 2.7, it is the respon-
   sibility of the owner to remove dead domesticated animals in military family housing (MFH). Individ-
   uals can contact the Base Veterinary Services for guidance on the proper disposal of the domesticated
   animal (VTF can cremate pets up to 50 lbs). Pest Management does not remove or dispose of MFH
   pets.

    Base Veterinary Services will be notified to determine disposition of animal.
       10.3.1. The owner of the pet should be notified through tag or collar information of the animal. If
       no tag or collar is available, Pest Management will pick up and remove the animal on the next duty
       day.

orders and hand-carry to the receiving VTF duty station a copy of DD Form 2344, Veterinary Treatment
Record, on each animal.
