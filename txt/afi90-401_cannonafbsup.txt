This supplement applies to all 27th Special Operations Wing (27 SOW) units and partner units.
It provides wing guidance and procedures for responding to requests for information or inquiries
from members of Congress and their staffs. It establishes the 27 SOW/IG as the installation
agency tasked to coordinate response to congressional and high-level inquiries. Congressional
inquiries are a grievance channel open to all 27 SOW personnel and their family members. The
procedures in this regulation are intended to ensure that complete and accurate responses are
released in a timely manner. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions

5.2.1. (Added) Upon receipt of an inquiry, the 27 SOW/IG will immediately coordinate with
the 27 SOW/CC, CV, DS and JA (if necessary) to determine a wing OPR and establish a
suspense for the response.
5.2.1.1. (Added) Responsibility for drafting replies to congressional inquiries rests with the
flight, squadron, group commander, or division chief with the functional expertise to answer the
question.
6. (Added) OPR Responsibilities:
6.1. (Added) Assigned wing OPRs will prepare an in-depth response that accurately answers
all questions and concerns prior to the deadline set by the Wing IG.
6.2. (Added) Timely response to Congressional or high-level inquiries is a command metric.
OPRs will ensure responses are provided by the established suspense date. If a final reply
cannot be forwarded within the established suspense date, immediately notify the 27 SOW/IG for
assistance. Do not attempt to contact the tasking agency for an extension. Do not wait until the
suspense due date to request assistance or an extension.
6.3. (Added) OPRs will prepare an Air Force Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, with an
appropriate response attached. The response will be routed to the JAG with the Wing IG
courtesy copied prior to being sent for Wing/CC signature. The 27 SOW/CC or CV will
approve/sign all replies to Congressional or high-level inquiries. Once signed by the CC or CV,
the Wing IG will send the reply to SAF/LLI (or their designated POC) and copy AFSOC/IGQ.
7. (Added) Installation Unit Responsibilities:
7.1. (Added) The Wing IG will be immediately notified of all incoming Congressional and
high-level inquiries. Note: This also includes requests for information from other organizations
that are responding to a Congressional or high-level inquiry regarding a 27 SOW issue.
8. (Added) Rules of engagement.
8.1. (Added) READ the inquiry and determine what primary issues need to be addressed or
answered. Often the root issues are buried in an emotional or wordy letter.
8.2. (Added) REMEMBER: Obtain the approval of any subjects of the complaint to release
the requested information back to the requesting agency. The Privacy Act Release in
Attachment 2 is provided for use. In addition, if the inquiry requires release of medical or
dental information, a DD Form 2870 must be completed and signed. If the subject will not
consent to either the Privacy Act Release or the 2870, a response will be drafted to the requesting
agency informing them that the information cannot be released for privacy act reasons.
9. (Added) Follow-up Action.
9.1. (Added) If the inquiry reveals an actual deficiency, follow-up action is required. The
appropriate commander or agency and the IG determine if the deficiency is a one-time
occurrence or if a systemic problem exists.
9.2. (Added) If a systemic problem exists, the IG will write a finding against the appropriate
section that will be tracked until closed.
